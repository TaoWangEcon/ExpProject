Full text: After decades in the political wilderness, "Medicare for all" and single-payer health care are suddenly popular. The words appear in political advertisements and are cheered at campaign rallies -- even in deep-red states. They are promoted by a growing number of high-profile Democratic candidates, like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in New York and Representative Beto O'Rourke in Texas. Republicans are concerned enough that this month President Trump wrote a scathing op-ed essay that portrayed Medicare for all as a threat to older people and to American freedom.
It is not that. But what exactly these proposals mean to many of the people who say they support them remains unclear.
As a renegade candidate for the 2016 Democratic nomination for president, Bernie Sanders opened the door to such drastic reform. Now, with Republicans showing little aptitude for fixing an expensive, dysfunctional health system, more voters, doctors and politicians are walking through it.
More than 120 members of Congress have signed on as co-sponsors of a bill called the Expanded and Improved Medicare for All Act, up from 62 in 2016. And at least 70 have joined Capitol Hill's new Medicare for All Caucus.
But some worry the terms "Medicare for all" and "single payer" are at risk of becoming empty campaign slogans. In precise terms, Medicare for all means bringing all Americans under the government's insurance program now reserved for people 65 and over, while single-payer health care would have the government pay everyone's medical bills. But few are speaking precisely.
Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster, said, "People read into 'Medicare for all' what they want to read into it."
For every candidate with a clear proposal in mind, another uses the phrases as a proxy for voter frustration. The risk, some critics say, is that "Medicare for all" could become a Democratic version of the Republican "repeal and replace" slogan -- a vote-getter that does not translate to political action because there is neither agreement about what it means nor a viable plan.
"If you're on the left, you have to have something on health care to say at town halls," said David Blumenthal, president of the Commonwealth Fund. "So you say this and move on. That's part of the motivation."
Dr. Carol Paris, the president of Physicians for a National Health Program, an advocacy group, said she has fielded a number of calls from candidates asking for tutorials on Medicare for all.
"I'm heartened, but not persuaded" that all the high-profile talk will result in any action, she said. She worries about what she called "faux 'Medicare for all' plans" that don't live up to the mantra.
Polling highlights health care as a top voter concern, and pressure is building for politicians to take meaningful action that could redress the pain caused by personal health care costs that continue to rise faster than inflation.
Maybe that action would be negotiating lower drug prices or fixing flaws in the insurance system that allow for surprise medical bills and high out-of-pocket costs. Republican candidates mostly continue to bad-mouth "Obamacare" as the root of all problems in American health care (of course, it's not), and some still push to repeal it. They tend to offer only vague assurances that, for example, they will guarantee that people with pre-existing conditions can find affordable insurance -- proposals that do not withstand expert scrutiny.
But more and more voters seem to think the country needs more radical change.
In polling this year, 51 percent of Americans and 74 percent of Democrats said they support a single-payer plan. Surveys suggest growing enthusiasm among doctors, too, with more than half in favor.
Yet experts suggest voter support may not withstand warnings of tax increases or changes to employer-sponsored insurance. A 2017 poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation found that support for Medicare for all dropped when respondents were told that their taxes might increase or that the government might get "too much control over health care" -- a common Republican talking point.
Despite initial enthusiasm, Vermont's governor let a state single-payer plan die in part because it was calculated that it would would equire an 11.5 percent payroll tax on businesses and a state income tax of up to 9.5 percent.
The broader goal -- affordable, universal health care -- could be achieved by a range of strategies. For models, we can look to nations that have generally achieved better health outcomes, for less money, than the United States.
Canada and Britain come particularly close to true single-payer. Their governments pay medical bills with money raised through taxes and have monopolistic negotiating power over prices. But after that, the systems differ.
In Canada, which is Mr. Sanders's inspiration, the government provides health insurance for most medical needs, with no out-of-pocket costs. People can, and often do, buy a second, private plan for any unmet health needs, such as prescription drugs.
Britain goes a step further. Its government owns hospitals and employs many specialists via the National Health Service. A small private system exists, catering mainly to wealthier people seeking faster access to elective procedures.
Other countries achieve universal health care (or nearly so), but without single-payer. France and Germany have kept an insurance system intact but heavily regulate health care, including by setting the prices for medical procedures and drugs, and requiring all citizens to purchase coverage.
These more incremental options have not captured the American imagination to the same extent as Medicare for all. But adopting such a system would require the biggest shift, with significant implications for taxes, patient choice, doctors' salaries and hospital revenue.
Enthusiastic politicians sometimes gloss over those consequences. For example, Liz Watson, a Democrat running in Indiana's Ninth Congressional District, suggested the impact on doctors' income was not much of a concern, because they would see a "huge recovery" on expenses since they would no longer need to navigate the bureaucracy of insurance paperwork. But analysts across the board agree single-payer would cut revenue for doctors -- many say by about 12 percent on average.
And many voters seem confused by the fundamentals. In polling by the Kaiser Family Foundation, about half of Americans said they believed they would be able to keep their current insurance under a single-payer plan, which is not the case.
Optimism without specifics carries risk, as Barack Obama learned after promising that people wouldn't lose their doctors under the Affordable Care Act. That promise haunted the Obama administration -- it was singled out as PolitiFact's "Lie of the Year" in 2013 and is still mocked by members of the Trump White House.
There's also the thorny issue of how Medicare for all would affect the thousands of jobs at private insurers. "We have an insurance industry in Omaha, and people say, 'I worry about those jobs,"' said Kara Eastman, a Democrat running on Medicare for all in Nebraska's Second District. She suggested people could be retrained, saying there would have to be "repurposing of positions."
Critics of Medicare for all, on the other hand, tend to exaggerate the costs of single-payer: "Denmark's top tax bracket is nearly 60 percent!" (True, although that's largely not because of health care.) "Doctors' incomes will drop 40 percent!" (True, specialists in private practice would probably see pay cuts, but primary care doctors could well see an increase.)
Canadians generally pay higher taxes than Americans do -- specifically a goods and services tax, and higher taxes on the wealthy. In Germany, working people pay 7.5 percent of income as a contribution toward comprehensive insurance.
But many Americans pay far more than that when you count premiums, deductibles, co-payments and out-of-network charges. Estimates of the tax increases required to support a Medicare-for-all or single-payer system are all over the map, depending on how the plan is structured, the prices paid to providers and drug makers, and the generosity of benefits.
As a politician famously noted, "Nobody knew health care could be so complicated."
Some candidates do have clear proposals in mind. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, for example, running for the House from New York's 14th District, is firm: a single, government-run health plan that covers everyone with no co-payments or deductibles and perhaps allows Americans to buy supplemental private coverage. It's the Canadian approach, textbook single-payer.
But many who back Medicare for all are vague or open to incremental approaches, like a "public option" that maintains the current insurance structure while allowing people to buy into Medicare.
Mr. O'Rourke casts Medicare for all as a starting point for discussion. But he said that what matters most is "high-quality, guaranteed universal health care." Getting there, he added, "will inevitably require some compromise" -- like a public option. Notably, he has not signed on as a co-sponsor of the Medicare for all bill because that plan does not allow for-profit providers to participate.
Jared Golden, a Democratic House candidate from Maine's Second District, says in his campaign materials that he favors "something like Medicare for all," but he clarified that at least initially, he would argue to lower the Medicare eligibility age, a change that wonks often call "Medicare for more."
And the Wisconsin Democrat Randy Bryce, who is running to replace Speaker Paul Ryan in the House, said he would support a public option or lowering the eligibility age for Medicare. "I don't want to say that there's only one way to go about it," Mr. Bryce said.
But many other candidates -- both for Congress and for governorships -- who are talking "Medicare for all" on the campaign trail either did not acknowledge or declined multiple requests to be interviewed on the subject. They include Andrew Gillum, who is running for governor in Florida; Gina Ortiz Jones of the Texas 23rd; the California candidate for governor Gavin Newsom; the Massachusetts Seventh candidate Ayanna Pressley; and the Pennsylvania First District candidate Scott Wallace.
Ms. Lake, the pollster, suggested that policy details simply aren't as relevant in a midterm year and that for now we shouldn't expect a candidate's support for Medicare for all to be anything more than a way to signal his or her values. But she suggested that will change in the run-up to 2020, adding, "When we head into the presidential election, people will probably be pickier and want more details."
That gives politicians and voters a few years to decide what they mean and what they want when they say they support Medicare for all or single-payer health care. For now, it's hard to read too much into promises.
Dr. Paris, who lives in Nashville, said she was surprised and excited to hear that her representative, Jim Cooper, a Blue Dog Democrat, had signed up as a co-sponsor of the Medicare for all bill.
"I told him, 'I'm dumbfounded,"' she recalled.
His answer? "Don't get too excited."

Full text: United States markets gave up an early rally on Friday and struggled to another mixed finish as investors continued to withdraw from former stock favorites like retailers. Shares of household goods makers rose again as a week of choppy trading concluded. Stocks surged in early trading after better than expected reports from companies including Procter & Gamble, American Express and PayPal. Procter & Gamble, the world's largest consumer products maker, had its biggest rally in 10 years. But the gains for indexes faded after a report showed that home sales fell for the sixth month in a row.
The market settled back into its usual pattern from the last two weeks, as companies that depend on economic growth struggled and those with more "defensive" qualities such as high dividends did better, a sign investors are worried about a few threats to growth: rising interest rates, trade tensions between the United States and China, and this week, some sluggish reports about housing construction and sales.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 1 point to 2,767.78. The Dow Jones industrial average gave up most of an early gain. It jumped as much as 229 points early on but finished 64.89 points higher, or 0.3 percent, at 25,444.34.
Tuesday was the best gain in six months for stocks, but the S.&P. 500 fell every other day this week and ended the week up just 0.02 percent. That was good enough to end a three-week run of losses, but most of the market's recent gains have been swiftly followed by declines.
The S.&P. 500 hasn't risen two days in a row since Sept. 20. It finished at a record high that day, which was the last in a three-day string of gains. The benchmark index is down 5.6 percent since then.
The Nasdaq composite sagged 36.11 points, or 0.5 percent, to 7,449.03. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks lost 18.71 points, or 1.2 percent, to 1,542.04. The Russell 2000 is at its lowest in almost six months as investors worry that the economy could slow and interest rates could rise, a bigger challenge for smaller companies.
Shares of Procter & Gamble, which makes Tide, Pampers and Gillette razors, soared 8.8 percent to $87.30 after the company reported that sales of fabric and home care products rose in its latest quarter while beauty products revenue jumped 20 percent.
Stocks of other household goods companies also rose. Pepsi shares gained 2.2 percent to $110.29 and Coca-Cola shares added 1.6 percent to $46.33. Shares of the electric utility Duke Energy rose 1.8 percent to $82.75.
The aerospace and building components maker Honeywell posted a bigger profit than analysts expected, but said it is seeing more signs of inflation in its business as a result of the tariffs the United States and China have placed on imported goods. Honeywell stock slid 1.1 percent to $153.47. Industrial companies have skidded recently as investors worried about the results of those trade tensions.
Bond prices slipped. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 3.20 percent from 3.18 percent.
China said its economic growth sank to a post-financial crisis low of 6.5 percent in the third quarter. Chinese finance officials launched a media blitz to shore up confidence in the country's sagging stock market. China's economy has gradually slowed for years, even before a trade dispute between Beijing and President Trump led to higher tariffs. The Chinese government tightened controls on lending last year to rein in a debt boom, but that, too, has affected the economy.
The Hang Seng index in Hong Kong rose 0.4 percent. The Kospi in Seoul added 0.4 percent. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 shed 0.6 percent.
The DAX in Germany lost 0.3 percent and in France, the CAC-40 sank 0.6 percent. In London, the FTSE 100 gained 0.3 percent. Tensions between European Union officials and Italy's new government sent Italian stocks and government bond prices lower Thursday. Italian bond prices turned higher Friday and yields slipped.
Benchmark United States crude rose 0.7 percent to $69.28 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, gained 0.6 percent to $79.78 a barrel in London.
Wholesale gasoline rose 1.2 percent to $1.91 a gallon. Heating oil inched up 0.3 percent to $2.30 a gallon. Natural gas added 1.6 percent to $3.25 per 1,000 cubic feet.
Gold dipped 0.1 percent to $1,226.50 an ounce. Silver rose 0.3 percent to $14.65 an ounce. Copper gained 1.1 percent to $2.78 a pound.
The dollar rose to 112.55 yen from 112.20 yen. The euro rose to $1.1506 from $1.1454.

Full text: Stocks in the United States resumed their October tumble on Thursday, led by a drop in technology stocks that tracked a sell-off in China. Tech firms led the Wall Street sell-off, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index and a closely watched index of semiconductor stocks slumping more than 2 percent. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 1.4 percent, leaving the broad stock market index down nearly 5 percent this month. A sharp decline in Chinese stocks on Thursday set the tone for the tech-driven drop. China's currency, the yuan, hit a 21-month low, amid the tariff fight between China and the United States, the world's largest economies.
"Perceptions in markets are evolving, and more people are nervous that this is going to be a long, drawn-out affair," said Robin Brooks, chief economist at the Institute of International Finance, a trade group and research provider.
China's government on Friday reported that the economy grew by 6.5 percent over the three months that ended in September compared with a year ago. But growing concerns about the health of its economy, along with rising interest rates that could slow the American economy, have made investors jumpy and worried that a near-perfect investing environment -- low inflation, strong growth and relatively low interest rates -- is becoming tougher to navigate.
Here's a rundown of what has been happening in the stock market.
Trading was volatile
The benchmark S.&P. was down as much as 1.9 percent. It ended the day down 1.4 percent.
Stocks started the day slightly lower after a big sell-off in China, but the drop picked up pace after the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said he would not attend a financial conference in Saudi Arabia amid the investigation into the disappearance of a dissident Saudi journalist.
Why has October been so lousy
The selling on Thursday came amid a bout of big swings for stocks. On Tuesday, shares posted their biggest gains in seven months. That was just a few days after they suffered their steepest drop in eight months. All month, worries about relations with China have weighed on technology stocks. The Nasdaq is down 7 percent this month. The Philadelphia semiconductor index is down nearly 9 percent. Interest rates are another worry. Yields fell Thursday, but the yield on the 10-year note is higher than 3.15 percent, up from less than 2.5 percent a year ago.
Investors are concerned that rising borrowing costs could crimp domestic growth. Small stocks, which are particularly susceptible to higher borrowing costs, fell 1.8 percent. And other interest-rate sensitive areas of the stock market have been beaten up in recent weeks. The S.&P. home-building index is down 10 percent this month, as mortgage rates have pushed above 5 percent.
What are investors going to look to next?
We're in the middle of earnings season -- and results from companies could help assuage the worst concerns. On the whole, results should be good. When they're tallied in a few weeks, profits for S.&P. 500 companies are expected to be up more than 20 percent, compared with last year. That's largely thanks to strong economic growth in the United States and deep corporate tax cuts.
But on Thursday, investors seemed to find gloom even in good earnings news. United Rentals -- a company that rents out construction and industrial equipment -- tumbled 15 percent after reporting earnings that were better than expected. Investors did not like the look of softer-than-expected rental price growth, which can be a leading indicator of a slowdown in the highly cyclical rental industry.
"Investors look at slowing rate growth and say, 'Well that's a negative signal,"' said Steven Fisher, who covers United Rentals as an equity analyst at UBS.
In the weeks ahead, the biggest technology companies will report results. Given the focus on China, a report by Apple could be particularly important. Apple manufactures its products there, but China is also a significant market for the company. Apple, which is down 4 percent this month, will report its results on Nov. 1.

The Trump Tax Scam, Phase II

Full text: When the Trump tax cut was on the verge of being enacted, I called it "the biggest tax scam in history," and made a prediction: deficits would soar, and when they did, Republicans would once again pretend to care about debt and demand cuts in Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. Sure enough, the deficit is soaring. And this week Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, after declaring the surge in red ink "very disturbing," called for, you guessed it, cuts in "Medicare, Social Security and Medicaid." He also suggested that Republicans might repeal the Affordable Care Act -- taking away health care from tens of millions -- if they do well in the midterm elections.
Any political analyst who didn't see this coming should find a different profession. After all, "starve the beast" -- cut taxes on the rich, then use the resulting deficits as an excuse to hack away at the safety net -- has been G.O.P. strategy for decades.
Oh, and anyone asking why Republicans believed claims that the tax cut would pay for itself is being naïve. Whatever they may have said, they never actually believed that the tax cut would be deficit-neutral; they pushed for a tax cut because it was what wealthy donors wanted, and because their posturing as deficit hawks was always fraudulent. They didn't really buy into economic nonsense; it would be more accurate to say that economic nonsense bought them.
That said, even I have been surprised by a couple of things about the G.O.P.'s budget bait-and-switch. One is the timing: I would have expected McConnell to hold his tongue until after the midterms. The other is the lying: I knew Donald Trump and his allies would be dishonest, but I didn't expect the lies to be as baldfaced as they are.
What are they lying about? For starters, about the causes of a sharply higher deficit, which they claim is the result of higher spending, not lost revenue. Mick Mulvaney, Trump's budget director, even tried to claim that the deficit is up because of the costs of hurricane relief.
The flimsy justification for such claims is that in dollar terms, federal revenue over the past year is slightly up from the previous year, while spending is about 3 percent higher.
But that's a junk argument, and everyone knows it. Both revenue and spending normally grow every year thanks to inflation, population growth and other factors. Revenue during Barack Obama's second term grew more than 7 percent a year. The sources of the deficit surge are measured by how much we've deviated from that normal growth, and the answer is that it's all about the tax cut.
Dishonesty about the sources of the deficit is, however, more or less a standard Republican tactic. What's new is the double talk that pervades G.O.P. positioning on the budget and, to be fair, just about every major policy issue.
What do I mean by double talk? Well, consider the fact that even as McConnell blames "entitlements" (that is, Medicare and Social Security) for deficits, and declares (falsely) that Medicare in particular is "unsustainable," Paul Ryan's super PAC has been running ads accusing Democrats of wanting to cut Medicare. The cynicism is breathtaking.
But then, it's no more cynical than the behavior of Republicans like Dean Heller, Josh Hawley and even Ted Cruz who voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which protects Americans with pre-existing medical conditions, or supported a lawsuit trying to strip that protection out of the act, and are now running on the claim that they want to ... protect people with pre-existing conditions.
The point is that we're now in a political campaign where one side's claimed position on every major policy issue is the opposite of its true position. Republicans have concluded that they can't win an argument on the issues, but rather than changing their policies, they're squirting out clouds of ink and hoping voters won't figure out where they really stand.
Why do they think they can get away with this? The main answer is obviously contempt for their own supporters, many of whom get their news from Fox and other propaganda outlets that slavishly follow the party line. And even in appeals to those supporters who rely on other sources, Republicans believe that they can neutralize the deep unpopularity of their actual policies by misrepresenting their positions, and win by playing to racism and fear.
But let's be clear: G.O.P. cynicism also involves a lot of contempt for the mainstream news media. Historically, media organizations have been remarkably unwilling to call out lies; the urge to play it safe with he-said-she-said reporting has very much worked to Republicans' advantage, given the reality that the modern G.O.P. lies a lot more than Democrats do. Even the most blatant falsehood tends to be reported with headlines about how "Democrats say" it's false, not that it's actually false.
Anyway, at this point Republicans are proclaiming that war is peace, freedom is slavery, ignorance is strength and the party that keeps trying to kill Medicare is actually the program's greatest defender.
Can a campaign this dishonest actually win? We'll find out in less than three weeks.

Full text: The Treasury Department released figures on Monday showing the federal budget deficit widened by 17 percent in the 2018 fiscal year, to $779 billion. That's an unusual jump for a year in which unemployment hit a five-decade low and the economy experienced a significant economic expansion. But the increase demonstrates that the tax cuts President Trump signed into law late last year have reduced federal revenues considerably, even against the backdrop of a booming economy. Some conservatives don't see the rising deficit numbers that way. They note that the Treasury reported that federal revenues rose by 0.4 percent from the 2017 fiscal year to the 2018 fiscal year, and view that as a sign that the tax cuts are "paying for themselves," as Republicans and Mr. Trump promised.
That's not the case.
There are several ways to ask the question, "Are tax cuts paying for themselves?" Based on the data we have right now, they all arrive at the same answer: "No."
Federal revenues are falling well short of projections -- even with strong economic growth
The issue here is not whether the government spends too much money, or whether tax cuts have buttressed economic growth, or even whether it's advisable to run such high deficits in flush economic times.
The issue instead is: Have the corporate and individual tax cuts that went into effect in January generated so much additional growth that tax revenues are as high, or higher, today than they would have been if the tax cuts never passed? That's how all scorekeepers -- be they independent congressional staff members or researchers from think tanks that lean liberal or conservative -- assess the "pay for themselves" question.
One way to think about it is from the perspective of a small-business owner. Let's say you run your own bakery. You sell bread for $4 a loaf. Today, you sold 90 loaves, for $360 in revenue. You expect that, because it's a busier day at the bakery tomorrow, you'll sell 100 loaves then, earning $400. But you'd like to sell even more than that, so you lower the price to $3 a loaf to encourage additional purchases.
Congratulations! You sell 125 loaves. Your revenue goes up, to $375. That's more than you brought in the day before. Your price cut, though, has not "paid for itself" -- because you ended up bringing in less revenue than you would have otherwise.
In other words, you brought in more money than the day before. But it's less than you would have made if you hadn't cut the price.
That's what we saw in the 2018 fiscal year with the tax cuts. A few months before they passed, the Congressional Budget Office predicted the government would take in $3.53 trillion in revenues for the fiscal year. On Monday, the Treasury reported that revenue was actually $3.33 trillion for the year -- $200 billion short, even though economic growth has outpaced the budget office's forecasts.
That's the equivalent of selling more loaves, but earning less money.
By several measures, post-tax-cut revenues have not grown at all
By the Treasury's numbers, total revenues grew 0.4 percent from the 2017 fiscal year to the 2018 fiscal year. That's weak, historically speaking, for an economy growing as fast as it is; in the 2015 fiscal year, when growth was comparable to what it is today, revenues grew 7.5 percent from the previous year.
The weak growth brought revenue as a share of gross domestic product down, something that typically happens in -- or around -- a recession, not deep into a robust expansion that the Fed has described as a "particularly bright" moment.
But revenue is definitely growing after the tax cuts, right?
Well, no.
The fiscal year runs from the start of October to the end of September. The tax cuts mostly took effect in January 2018. That means three months of the 2018 fiscal year included a period without the tax cuts in place. If you look only at the nine months after the cuts took effect, you'll see that revenue is ever so slightly down, year over year: From January through September 2017, revenues were $2.57 trillion. For the same period in 2018, they were $2.56 trillion. Which is to say, they're down by $10 billion, in a direct comparison after the tax cuts started. Personal tax receipts are up on their own, but corporate tax receipts are down by about a third from a year ago.
That overall drop looks worse when you consider inflation. A dollar today buys about 2 percent less than it did a year ago, according to the inflation index used by the Federal Reserve to set monetary policy. So the government brought in slightly less money year over year, and that money was worth less than the equivalent amount a year ago, which means it buys fewer meals for troops, materials for highway construction or any of the other goods and services that tax dollars go toward.
This is exactly what most forecasters predicted
When the tax law passed, members of Congress had all sorts of evidence suggesting it would accelerate America's growing budget deficits. The Joint Committee on Taxation and the Tax Policy Center predicted that the new law would add at least $1 trillion to deficits over the next 10 years, even after accounting for additional economic growth. The Penn Wharton Budget Model predicted it would add $2 trillion. The most optimistic mainstream model that analyzed all the provisions of the new law, from the Tax Foundation, predicted it would add about $450 billion to the deficit after accounting for additional growth.
Republicans dismissed those warnings. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he expected the new law to more than pay for itself -- it would help to reduce future deficits. It's possible that optimism could turn out to be right, but only if the tax cuts unleash a sustained boom in productivity and economic growth, and with them, much higher revenues than we saw this past fiscal year. In other words, we're going to need to make -- and sell -- a lot more loaves.

Stocks Erase Early Losses After Huge Gain; IBM Sinks on Weak Sales

Full text: After an early slide, stocks in the United States clawed back much of the ground they lost and ended slightly lower Wednesday. Banks climbed but retailers, homebuilders and smaller companies fell. Stocks slumped in morning trading as homebuilders and retailers took sharp losses after the Commerce Department said construction of new homes dropped in September. Technology companies fell as IBM suffered its biggest loss in five and a half years after it reported weak sales. Stocks were coming off their biggest gain in more than six months.
Bond prices fell, sending yields higher, after the Federal Reserve said some of its policymakers argued in their latest meeting that the central bank should raise rates to a level that slows economic growth slightly. After years of record low rates following the financial crisis, the fact that some policymakers are talking about eventually using them to slow the economy is a big change.
Jeremy Zirin, head of investment strategy for UBS's global wealth management business, said the Fed will not raise rates to those levels unless there is clear evidence inflation has increased. But he said it makes sense for investors to be wary.
"Overly restrictive monetary policy is a risk to the bull market," he said. "It would be a mistake for (the Fed) to raise rates in the absence of inflation beyond their target, and it's exceedingly unlikely to do so."
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 0.71 points to 2,809.21. The Dow Jones industrial average slumped 91.74 points, or 0.4 percent, to 25,706.68. It lost as much as 319 points before briefly turning higher.
The Nasdaq composite slid 2.79 points to 7,642.70.
Stock trading has been erratic recently. Earlier this month the benchmark S.&P. 500 index went through a six-day losing streak that included huge drops last Wednesday and Thursday. Then on Friday the index jumped 1.4 percent, its biggest rally in three months, fell on Monday, and surged 2.1 percent Tuesday. Trading had been steady from late June to early October.
The Federal Reserve released minutes from its meeting in late September, when it raised interest rates for the third time this year. A few participants believed that the Fed's key interest rate would eventually need to "become modestly restrictive" to make sure inflation does not climb too high. Other officials felt the Fed should not take that step unless there are signs the economy is overheating and inflation is rising quickly.
Bond prices sank. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 3.21 percent from 3.16 percent.
Home construction in the United States fell 5.3 percent in September, according to the Commerce Department. The pace of homebuilding has slowed since May, and the report is the latest sign that rising home values and increasing mortgage rates may be weighing on the market.
Lennar gave up 2.3 percent to $43.08 and PulteGroup shed 3.4 percent to $22.82. Among retailers, Home Depot fell 4.3 percent to $185.17, while Target lost 1.6 percent to $84.42 and Macy's dipped 5 percent to $31.84.
Some investors worried that a weaker housing market is a bad sign for the economy. Mr. Zirin, of UBS, said the housing market should keep getting stronger as long as employment is high and wages are rising, but investors are not sure what is ahead for the economy or stocks.
"When you get into the latter stages of a bull market or the economic expansion, investors get more nervous about the latter stages turning into the end of the cycle," he said. "They start looking for any signals that would lead them to believe that a downturn is imminent."
Insurer Prudential rose 1.9 percent to $99.70 after regulators lifted the strict government oversight that was imposed on the company after the 2008-09 financial crisis. Prudential was deemed "systemically important," which meant it was subject to special restrictions because of its importance to the financial system. It was the last company still carrying that label.
IBM sank 7.6 percent to $134.05 after its sales in the third quarter fell short of analysts' estimates.
The price of United States crude oil dropped 3 percent to $69.75 a barrel in New York, its first close below $70 a barrel in a month, after the government said energy stockpiles jumped last week.
Netflix added 5.3 percent to $364.70 after the streaming video company said it picked up 7 million subscribers in the third quarter, beating forecasts.
The dollar rose to 112.49 yen from 112.18 yen. The euro fell to $1.1505 from $1.1578.
Gold slipped $3.60 to $1,223.70 an ounce.

Istanbul Offers Credit to Ride Subway for Recycling Bottles

Full text: Istanbul on Wednesday rolled out an alternative currency for commuters who need to top up their subway cards but are short of cash: recyclables. The city is installing "reverse vending machines" at metro stations that allow passengers to add credit to their subway cards simply by inserting a plastic bottle or aluminum can into the machine.
Once a value has been assigned to the recyclables, the machine will crush, shred and sort the material.
The initiative aims to encourage recycling in the city of more than 15 million people, where recycling practices are scant or indifferent. But the alternative way of paying to travel is sure to be welcomed by commuters, as Turkey's currency has been hammered lately, falling to record lows against the dollar because of soaring inflation, economic mismanagement by the Turkish government and tensions with the United States.
This is how the vending machines would work: A 0.33-liter plastic bottle, for example, roughly equivalent to 11 ounces, would add 2 Turkish cents to a subway card, while a 0.5-liter bottle would add 3 cents and a 1.5-liter bottle would add 6 cents. (A subway journey costs 2.60 Turkish lira, about 40 United States cents; 100 Turkish cents, or kurus, make up 1 Turkish lira.)
A commuter would need around 28 1.5-liter bottles to buy a single-journey ticket. Aluminum cans are more valuable, returning 9 Turkish cents for a 0.5-liter can.
Istanbul's mayor, Mevlut Uysal, said the machines would track the number of bottles recycled by each passenger and reward those recycling the largest number of containers with free or discounted events such as theater tickets.
Turkey is Europe's third-largest producer of household and commercial waste, after Germany and France, and it is the worst in the region at recycling, according to a 2017 report by the consultancy group Expert Market, which is based in Britain.
"Most households do not automatically recycle because they are unaware of the benefits to the environment, and others are just lazy," Elif Cengiz, a manager for the waste management project, called Zero Waste, said in a phone interview on Wednesday. "These new machines give people a direct incentive to recycle while educating them about the benefits of recycling."
Ms. Cengiz explained that the municipality had made waste management a priority in recent years because of rising concern over the damage that waste is causing to the environment.
The country's recycling drive has started to produce results, saving 30 million trees in 15 months since last June, Mustafa Ozturk, the under secretary for the Environment and Urban Planning Ministry, said.
More than half of all the plastic bottles in Turkey were recycled last year, according to the ministry, and more than 1.7 million tons of waste paper and cartons were recycled last year and in the first three months of 2018.
"This means we saved 24.6 million trees from being cut in 2017, and another 5.4 million in the first quarter of this year," Mr. Ozturk said in a statement. "The use of recycled material in production contributes to productivity and separate storage for paper waste also saves storage space and decreases waste collecting costs for local administrations."
The first reverse vending machines were installed at the I.T.U.-Ayazaga Station, and the municipality plans to install at least 100 more at 25 locations across the city, including at schools and universities, by the end of the year.
Along with paying for subway rides, the cards can be used to ride the bus and tram, and even to gain access to public toilets.
"I sometimes use the recycling cans at school, but usually I forget and just put my bottles in a regular bin," said Meltem Ozil, a philosophy student who uses the ITU metro station to get to university.
"I haven't seen the new machines yet," she said by phone, "but I'm sure all the students will use them to get some extra money. Who doesn't want a free ride?"

Despite Trump's Anger, Fed Plans to Continue On Path to Raise Rates

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve's official account of its latest policy meeting, published Wednesday, does not mention any discussion of President Trump's demands that the Fed should stop raising interest rates. But it makes clear that Mr. Trump's economic policies are very much on the Fed's mind.
The strength of economic growth, thanks in part to the tax cuts Mr. Trump championed last year, is prompting Fed officials to consider the need to prevent the economy from overheating for the first time since the 2008 financial crisis, according to the minutes of the September meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee.
Most Fed officials predicted in September that the Fed would raise its benchmark interest rate to a mildly restrictive level, above 3 percent, by the second half of 2019.
"It's time to readjust the policy stance at least to neutral," Charles L. Evans, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said Friday on CNBC. "Let's see how the economy is performing at that point, and then we might have to do a little bit more after that."
But the Fed remains uncertain about its plans for the coming year, and one reason is that Fed officials also are concerned that Mr. Trump's trade policies could impede economic growth, the minutes said.
The Fed has said Mr. Trump's policies, including tariffs on steel, aluminum and a wide range of Chinese goods, have not yet dented aggregate measures of economic growth.
But the minutes said some businesses told Fed officials that "uncertainty regarding trade policy" played a role in decisions "to forgo production or investment opportunities." In particular, it said, "tariffs on aluminum and steel were cited as reducing new investment in the energy sector."
The Fed's overall tone remains bright and sunny. The economy is in the 10th year of one of the longest expansions in American history, and officials expect the good times to continue.
The bottom line, the Fed said, was that the economy "was evolving about as anticipated." Spending is up, driven in part by the tax cut, and a few Fed officials said they saw evidence that companies were beginning to increase investment in response to the tax cut, although the minutes did not elaborate.
Fed officials are paid to worry about potential economic problems, and the minutes include a familiar list: Increased disruptions to trade could weigh on growth; slower economic growth in the rest of the world could weigh on the United States; a shortage of workers could begin to increase inflation.
But the minutes said these risks were roughly balanced by the potential for faster economic growth.
The Fed raised its benchmark rate by a quarter percentage point at the September meeting, to a range between 2 percent and 2.25 percent. Investors expect another quarter-point increase at the Fed's final meeting of the year, in December, and the minutes will most likely reinforce that expectation.
The march toward higher rates has drawn a sharp response from Mr. Trump, who has lately seized any opportunity to throw verbal rocks at the Fed, most recently on Tuesday, when he told Fox Business that he regards the central bank's march toward higher interest rates as "my biggest threat."
Mr. Trump complained that the Fed is "raising rates too fast" despite the low level of inflation.
The president said he had not spoken directly about his concerns with the Fed's chairman, Jerome H. Powell, adding, "I'm not happy with what he's doing because it's going too fast."
Some liberal economists and advocates have also criticized the rate increases. Inflation remains around the 2 percent annual pace that the Fed regards as healthy, and Fed officials have said they see little sign or danger of an acceleration. Critics of the rate increases argue that encouraging continued economic growth would pull more people back into the labor force, and put more money into workers' pockets.
Mr. Powell, for his part, has declined to respond directly to the president's attacks, saying only that the Fed would make policy decisions based on economic data, without regard to political considerations. But he has defended the trajectory of Fed policy, arguing that the central bank is trying to strike a balance between encouraging economic growth and maintaining control of inflation.
Some former Fed officials have criticized Mr. Trump's remarks.
Mr. Powell's predecessor, Janet L. Yellen, said last week that it was "not a desirable thing" for a president to comment on Fed policy. "There's no law against that, but I don't think it's wise."
Investors so far have discounted the influence of Mr. Trump's remarks, but some analysts warn that the attacks are likely to intensify. "Once rates get to 'tightening' levels, we would expect the president to step up his attacks just like he has against drug prices, oil prices, unfair trade practices," said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank. Mr. Rupkey predicted that the attacks could make the Fed more reluctant to raise rates; other analysts argue that Mr. Trump could spur the central bank to demonstrate its independence by pressing ahead with rate increases.
A quarter-point increase at the December meeting would leave the Fed's benchmark rate about half a point below the 3 percent level that most Fed officials regard as neutral, meaning that the level of interest rates would neither be stimulating nor discouraging economic growth.
Most Fed officials expect to raise rates at least three times next year. That could push the benchmark rate into restrictive territory by the fall of 2019. The minutes said officials favoring such actions thought it might be necessary "to reduce the risk of a sustained overshooting of the committee's 2 percent inflation objective or the risk posed by significant financial imbalances."
Mr. Powell and other Fed officials have emphasized, however, that there is considerable uncertainty about the exact point at which monetary policy would tilt into restrictive territory.

Full text: The orders poured in from everywhere -- 105,000 a day at one point -- so much so that the company became an economic force. It could make or break suppliers by promoting their products. It could dictate terms on manufacturing. Its headquarters city boomed as this tech-driven retailer built huge warehouses and factories and attracted other businesses and rivals. State and local governments complained that the company was harming small-town retailers. That was Sears, Roebuck & Company in the early 20th century in Chicago. But at various times in the history of retailing you could apply like descriptions of retail might to Walmart, Kmart, Safeway, A.&P., and F.W. Woolworth, whose Downtown Manhattan headquarters building was christened the "Cathedral of Commerce" when it opened in 1913. Today the Woolworth Building is a luxury condo whose young residents are probably unaware of the extraordinary entrepreneur who built it.
Which is to say that becoming the nation's leading retailer does not guarantee immortality, at least not beyond architecture. Sears, once America's dominant retailer, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after 132 years in business.
Sears became the Amazon of its day because its co-founder Richard Warren Sears harnessed two great networks to serve his enterprise -- the railroads and the United States Postal Service. When the Postal Service commenced rural free delivery in 1896 (the "last mile" in today's jargon) every homestead in America became within reach.
And Richard Sears reached them. He used his genius for advertising and promotion to put a catalog in the hands of 20 million Americans in 1900, when the population was 76 million. The Wish Book or Big Book or Dream Book, as the catalog was variously called, could run a staggering 1,500 pages and offer more than 100,000 items. And when one of his pants suppliers, the manufacturing wizard Julius Rosenwald, became his partner, in 1886, Sears was on the way to becoming a vertically integrated juggernaut. Whether you needed a cream separator or a catcher's mitt, a plow or a dress, or an entire house, Sears had it. "No matter where you go or how long you look, you'll not find values approaching those this book presents," the spring 1922 catalog declared.
Sears would carve up the catalog landscape with a local rival, Montgomery Ward. Remember it? Probably not. The e-sales promotion company Groupon, itself once mighty and now clinging to life, occupies part of Ward's former headquarters in Chicago. Sears, Montgomery Ward and another Midwestern-born general merchandise retailer, J.C. Penney, dominated postwar American retailing, controlling 43 percent of department store sales by 1975. But even by then, Sears was beginning to falter under waves of new competition.
The company was not alone. A.&P., which introduced the first cut-rate grocery store in 1912, was also sliding into a long decline that would last through decades of ownership and management changes. Great A.&P. went through the final checkout lane in 2016 following its second bankruptcy. (Or was that the third?) A.&P. once operated 15,819 stores and ran the world's largest food packaging plant, in Horseheads, N.Y. The company was so powerful that in 1949 trustbusters tried to slice it into seven independent companies. Even before that, states passed "chain laws" that included minimum markups, so small stores couldn't be undermined by the loss leaders that A.&P. would offer to attract shoppers. A.&P., a vicious competitor, buried local retailers anyway.
By the inflation-racked 1970s, though, A.&P. was struggling against nimbler chains such as Safeway, which became the country's top grocer, and Kroger, as well as new models of retailing such as big-box stores. Walmart's eventual move into groceries would help seal A.&P.'s fate, and, at the same time, make the Arkansas company the nation's top retailer, where it remains. For now.
A.&P. would later show some dubious creativity when in the early 1980s management scrapped and replaced the "overfunded" pension plan, plundering it for operating capital. This piece of sliminess was copied all over corporate America, signaling the end of the pension plans that so many workers depended on for retirement income.
In its earlier days, with strong leaders such as Robert E. Wood, Sears was able to negotiate huge shifts in the economic and demographic landscape. By 1925, more Americans were living in the cities than in rural areas. Sears followed them by opening retail stores. The postwar boom would give rise to the suburban shopping mall, and Sears could easily finance and grab what were then (but not necessarily now) the best locations across the country.
By the mid-1980s, after a restructuring, the company briefly blossomed anew, in part by becoming a more full-blown conglomerate that owned Allstate Insurance and the Dean Witter brokerage. Sears also tried to crack the credit card market with its Discover card. The rationale was that Americans trusted Sears on the spending side of family finance, so why wouldn't they do the same on the savings side? The proposal was framed this way: "Would you buy stocks where you buy socks?" Answer: Not really.
High up in the Sears Tower, management couldn't see that the retail landscape was changing. Sears couldn't compete effectively with Walmart and the growth of big box merchandisers such as Toys "R" Us. But more important, the company could not summon the vision to anticipate the internet. By 1993, Sears had closed its national network of warehouses and exited the catalog business -- which is basically e-retailing without the "e." Amazon shipped its first book in 1995.
Which brings us to Eddie Lampert, the chief executive of ESL Investments, who bought Sears in 2005 figuring, wrongly, that he could reinvigorate it. Mr. Lampert recently blamed Sears' retirees for some of the company's problems, complaining that paying them the money they were owed was holding the company back. He's spent a decade shrinking Sears (and Kmart, which is part of the parent company, Sears Holdings) and then blamed the economy, the weather, Walmart, Amazon and everything else when his plan foundered. Saddled with debt it can't afford, Sears is filing for Chapter 11 to keep itself afloat through the Christmas holidays. No one wants to buy into Mr. Lampert's latest restructuring plan, which would sell ESL control of some of Sears' best remaining assets, including the Kenmore appliance brand.
Amazon, the world's leading e-tailer, is now one of the biggest clients of the . Postal Service. As Sears did in 1925, Amazon has moved into brick-and-mortar retail, buying Whole Foods and opening its own stores as it tries to close the store gap with Walmart. And the company has gone well beyond any retailer in terms of diversification, including web and cloud hosting, original content, fashion, hardware, even an airline fleet. Amazon certainly has the government's attention, or at least the president's, and its recent announcement of a minimum wage of $15 an hour for all United States employees will stave off some of the withering criticism about its employment practices. Amazon's goal is to be less disliked than Walmart, apparently.
Certainly, Amazon looks unassailable in its current form. So did every retailer that became the biggest dog on retail's porch. They were all innovative. They all pushed the boundaries on pricing, sourcing, marketing, regulation, employment, expansion and tax breaks. They all ultimately lost their way. Sears is the latest chapter in that story. And probably not the last.

Full text: U.S. stocks rocketed to their biggest gain in six months Tuesday following strong earnings from major financial and health care companies as well as encouraging reports on the economy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 547 points. Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and UnitedHealth led a parade of companies that reported profits for the third quarter that surpassed analysts' expectations. Technology companies also jumped after taking steep losses during the market's rout last week.
The S&P 500 index jumped 59.13 points, or 2.1 percent, its largest gain since March 26, and finished at 2,809.92. Stocks have bounced around over the last three days, and the S&P 500 is down 4.1 from its record high on Sept. 20. The Dow gained 547.87 points, or 2.2 percent, to 25,798.42.
The Nasdaq composite climbed 214.75 points, or 2.9 percent, to 7,645.49 as technology companies reversed some of their outsize losses from the last few days. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks had its biggest rally in almost two years as it surged 43.74 points, or 2.8 percent, to 1,596.84.
Investors were encouraged by some good news on the economy. The Labor Department said U.S. employers posted the most jobs in two decades in August while hiring continued to increase and the Federal Reserve said output by U.S. factories, mines and utilities climbed in September despite the effects of Hurricane Florence.
Even with the big gains, major indexes are still broadly lower for the month following a two-day rout last week. The Dow slumped nearly 1,400 points as bond yields jumped and investors worried that a rapid increase in interest rates would slow economic growth.
Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist for the Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said stocks jumped because the industrial production report suggests inflation isn't speeding up, and that investors took that as a sign the Fed won't accelerate the pace of its interest rate increases.
"Anything that helps the market think that the Fed won't make a mistake is good," Wren said.
While investors' fears about rising rates and inflation seem to have eased, trading in October has been very volatile. Before that, the third quarter was marked by the type of calm, steady gains seen throughout 2017.
The last time U.S. stocks suffered a notable slide was in March, and strong corporate earnings helped start a turnaround after that.
Netflix soared 12 percent to $387 in aftermarket trading after reporting surprisingly strong subscriber growth during the summer. That was a welcome change from the big losses it took after its second-quarter report, when it posted disappointing subscriber totals and gave a weak forecast. Netflix is up 80.5 percent this year, the fourth-best of any S&P 500 stock.
UnitedHealth, the largest U.S. health insurer and provider of privately-run Medicare Advantage plans, once again topped Wall Street forecasts and raised its projections for the year. The stock climbed 4.7 percent to $272.57. That suggests other health insurers are likely to report strong results in the next few weeks. Cigna advanced 3.9 percent to $211.96.
Health care products giant Johnson & Johnson added 1.9 percent to $136.56 after it said prescription sales jumped.
Morgan Stanley rose 5.7 percent to $45.94 and Goldman Sachs added 3 percent to $221.70 after the two investment banks did better than expected in the third quarter, helped by strong performance in their trading operations and better-than-expected revenue from stock underwriting. Morgan Stanley's stock has fallen 12 percent this year and Goldman has lost 13 percent.
Technology companies rose. Microsoft jumped 3.2 percent to $110.65 and Adobe rallied 9.5 percent to $260.67 after it backed its fourth-quarter profit and revenue forecasts. The stock has jumped 49 percent this year, but had slumped in recent days. Internet companies also advanced. Alphabet, Google's parent company, rose 2.8 percent to $1,133.08.
On Wednesday Canada will legalize marijuana nationwide. While cannabis companies mostly traded lower Tuesday, the stocks have made huge gains this year in highly volatile trading. Tilray fell 4.4 percent to $158.38 while Canopy Growth shed 6.8 percent to $53.01.
Benchmark Capital analyst Mike Hickey started coverage of Tilray with a $200 price target Tuesday, saying its supply deals with pharmacies and a partnership with drugmaker Novartis will help make it an early leader in the market. Hickey valued the Canadian cannabis market at about $3.2 billion in 2019 and said it will climb to $8.1 billion by 2023.
Tilray's market value stands at almost $15 billion, up ninefold since it went public in mid-July. Canopy Growth, which recently announced a big investment from Corona beer maker Constellation Brands, has more than doubled in value to $12.2 billion.
The huge gains reflect investors' view that that other countries will legalize marijuana in the years to come.
U.S. benchmark crude oil added 0.2 percent to $71.92 per barrel in New York. Brent crude, the international standard, rose 0.8 percent to $81.41 per barrel in London.
Wholesale gasoline rose 1.7 percent to $1.98 a gallon and heating oil picked up 0.6 percent to $2.34 a gallon. Natural gas lost 0.1 percent to $3.24 per 1,000 cubic feet.
Bond prices edged lower. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 3.17 percent from 3.16 percent.
Gold rose 0.1 percent to $1,231 an ounce. Silver lost 0.2 percent to $14.70 an ounce. Copper slipped 0.3 percent to $2.78 a pound.
The dollar rose to 112.18 yen from 111.88 yen. The euro fell to $1.1578 from $1.1584.
France's CAC 40 added 1.5 percent while the DAX in Germany jumped 1.4 percent. Britain's FTSE 100 rose 0.4 percent. Italy's FTSE MIB jumped 2.2 percent after the government avoided last-minute delays in presenting a budget plan.
Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 rallied 1.2 percent and the Kospi in South Korea was little changed. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index finished 0.1 percent higher.

Full text: RACINE, Wis. -- This city's downtown was all but empty on a recent Sunday afternoon, but one storefront office was so packed with Democrats that people had to wait outside. One by one, the party's top Wisconsin candidates took a microphone and fixated on a single villain -- a Republican who drew jeers from the campaign volunteers preparing to make phone calls and walk door to door with clipboards and pleas for votes.
The target? Not President Trump, who drew only passing mention. It was Scott Walker, the state's governor. His eight years in office are the Democrats' greatest weapon this fall, even as his economic record has become their greatest complication.
"Forty days is not enough to talk about all the awful things Scott Walker's done," Mandela Barnes, the Democrats' nominee for lieutenant governor, called out.
Randy Bryce, a mustachioed former ironworker who hopes to seize the seat that House Speaker Paul Ryan is leaving, mocked the "Scott-holes" that he said plague Wisconsin's roads.
And Tony Evers, a grandfatherly-looking state schools superintendent who is running against Mr. Walker, said that it was high time they hold the governor accountable for cuts to schools, rising health care costs and a state economy that may look dazzling in headlines but, Mr. Evers says, doesn't always feel that way to residents.
Wisconsin, which had not picked a Republican for president since 1984, shocked the country in 2016 by backing Mr. Trump. In hindsight, it shouldn't have been such a surprise: Mr. Walker and the Republican-controlled Legislature were re-elected in 2014 after slashing taxes, and many Republicans, independents and even some fiscally-minded Democrats saw benefit in a firmer line on the size and costs of government, not to mention lower tax bills.
But now there's a rising debate over whether this state needs more than Mr. Walker's unbending rectitude. One question for Democrats is whether they can successfully make an economic argument at a time when Wisconsin's economic indicators are strong. By most metrics, Wisconsin's economy is doing well. At 3 percent, the state's unemployment rate is well below the national average of 3.7 percent.
Nationally, Democratic leaders are watching Wisconsin closely, in part to understand how to run against a relatively upbeat economy, and in part for lessons for winning back the state in the 2020 presidential election.
As in other once-blue states, the Trump victory in Wisconsin led to new energy among Democrats this year, turning a state Supreme Court seat over to a liberal candidate, electing Democrats in special elections to two state legislative seats that had long been held by Republicans, and drawing a higher primary election voter turnout in August than the Republicans saw.
But for the moment, just like party candidates in some other places, many Wisconsin Democrats are running hard against Mr. Walker and the Republican establishment that has moved the state firmly to the right, and less overtly against President Trump. Part of it is calculation: Avoid alienating independent voters who may have voted for Mr. Trump.
Kriss Marion, an organic vegetable farmer and Democrat who is running for a Wisconsin State Senate seat that Democrats have targeted as one they might flip, said the president's name rarely comes up when she is knocking at doors in the small towns and rural, rolling hills of her senate district, which Mr. Trump won in 2016.
"I would never bring that up," she said. "I think it's a distraction."
After years of setbacks, including a failed effort to remove Mr. Walker in a recall election, Wisconsin Democrats' dreams are suddenly vast. They hope not only to hold onto Tammy Baldwin's United States Senate seat but to win the governor's office and control of the State Senate. With redistricting and advantages going into the 2020 presidential race at stake, Democrats have fielded candidates for more state legislative seats than in recent memory.
But the Democrats' most challenging problem may not be on the ballot.
"Wisconsin is working," Mr. Walker told reporters about the economy, after a campaign event not long ago. "Democrats are trying to tell something to people that's not true with what they actually know and see."
He added: "We can't afford to turn around now."
A 'blue wave' meets Scott Walker
For months, as Wisconsin residents debated the possibility of a "blue wave" of Democratic votes on Election Day, one unlikely voice has repeatedly warned that it could happen: Scott Walker himself.
Mr. Walker, who is 50 and seeking a third term in a state where nearly everyone already has an opinion of him, rocked up and down in his sneakers the other day as he waited for his introduction at the edge of a stage in Burlington. He looked impatient to get to work.
Wearing an Aaron Rodgers' Green Bay Packers jersey, Mr. Walker told the crowd of supporters something that most of them might have argued with had it come from anyone else.
The polls show a tight race, Mr. Walker warned the crowd, and they should be believed.
"Don't explain the polls by saying they're wrong," he said. "Explain the polls by saying that's all the motivation we need to talk to more voters."
"The only way we fail to win," he said, "is if the truth gets blurred over."
Last week, the Marquette Law School Poll found Mr. Walker a percentage point ahead of Mr. Evers among likely voters. The poll showed Ms. Baldwin with a 10-point lead in her Senate race against Leah Vukmir, a Republican ally of Mr. Walker from the Legislature.
Mr. Walker, a former lawmaker and county executive who ran for president briefly and knows Wisconsin politics like few others, has countered shows of mounting Democratic strength with a fierce, unrelenting campaign: The state Republican Party ran an ominous-sounding ad accusing Mr. Evers, in his role as a schools leader, of failing to properly discipline teachers accused of sexual misconduct; the Republicans have issued sharp warnings that Democrats would return the state to days of high taxes and budget deficits; and, most of all, Mr. Walker ticks off Wisconsin's economic successes every chance he gets.
In addition to the state's 3 percent unemployment rate, wage growth is picking up speed after lagging the rest of the country for much of 2016 and 2017. Average hourly earnings in the state are up five percent from a year ago, compared with a 2.9 percent increase nationally.
"It's hard to argue we need a change economically as people are doing well," said Noah Williams, director of the Center for Research on the Wisconsin Economy at the University of Wisconsin -- Madison.
The turnaround was a long time coming, however. The state lost more than 175,000 jobs between 2008 and 2010 and it took until 2015 for total employment to get back to where it had been before the recession.
One of Mr. Walker's campaign promises during his initial run for governor in 2010 was to create 250,000 jobs in his first term, which ended in early 2015. He reached that goal in April 2018, more than seven years after taking office.
"Most people feel that the state is really doing well," said Rosanne Hahn, a retired teacher who conferred with Mr. Walker outside his Burlington event and said she plans to vote for him. "A lot of times there are many jobs and people won't take them," Ms. Hahn said.
Running against the Walker economy
Mr. Evers, 66, was a teacher and principal before he became the state's Superintendent of Public Instruction, and he looks the part -- a pen at the ready in his dress shirt pocket, a flop of white hair and a gentle smile.
His name is widely known in the state, but his political style is factual and bland, a concern for some Democratic voters who say they wonder whether a more inspirational candidate could better seize the political moment. But some strategists say Mr. Evers, who won the nomination in a wide field of primary candidates, is a safe, ideal choice for keeping the focus not on himself -- but on Mr. Walker's legacy.
By Mr. Evers's telling, the state's economic picture may be the centerpiece of Mr. Walker's campaign, but that doesn't make it a less potent argument for the Democrats -- largely, he says, because people don't feel like things are as upbeat as the statistics imply.
"He can talk about the unemployment rate until the cows come home," Mr. Evers said in an interview. "Most people are just scraping by, so that doesn't mean anything to them. Many of the people that are employed are having to get two or three jobs just make ends meet. Also, we're in a state that people are leaving because of the decisions he has made. There's a lot of data out there other than the unemployment rate."
This is how Wisconsin Democrats are pivoting from a strict economic pitch to a case that may be easier to make: They say that Mr. Walker's political philosophy has starved Wisconsin of money for needed services.
When Mr. Walker first entered office, he cut spending on schools. Gradual increases followed and the most recent budget had an infusion of new dollars, Tamarine Cornelius, an analyst at the Wisconsin Budget Project, said. But, she added, the new funds were not enough to make up for the initial cut, after adjusting for inflation.
Aid to the state's university system has also been cut under Mr. Walker. In the 2010-11 budget year, state funding totaled $1.179 billion. It dropped by $178 million the following year after he took office, and stood at $1.06 billion in 2017-2018.
Under Mr. Walker's watch, the state ranked 44th in a U.S. News and World Report ranking of road quality. Adjusted for inflation, in fiscal 2019 Wisconsin's transportation budget remains 20 percent below where it was in 2010.
Even as needed services were deprived of money, Mr. Evers says, the state was agreeing to a deal that would provide $3 billion in tax credits so that Foxconn, a Taiwanese electronics company, could build a campus in Southeast Wisconsin. "We're starving the school systems but giving this Hail Mary version of economic development with one company?" Mr. Evers said. "It's a terrible deal."
Around the state, Democrats said they had not felt the benefit of the state's impressive economic statistics. Manufacturing plays an outsize role here; the factory sector is responsible for 18.6 percent of economic output, compared with 11.7 percent for the United States as a whole. Nearly half a million Wisconsin residents work in manufacturing, up 24,000 since the beginning of 2017, but still shy of the total before the recession.
"Whoopee!" Denis Olson, who is 62 and fixes tractors, said of the state's low unemployment rate. "If you're looking for a job for a buck over minimum wage you can find them. Every low-paying job is hiring, but who can live on that?"
The State Senate up for grabs?
In Blanchardville, a village of just more than 800 people, homecoming royalty and homemade floats rolled down Main Street on a sunny, windy Saturday not long ago. One float bore a canoe and a sign that read "Come Hell or High Water," an allusion to widespread and damaging flooding in parts of Wisconsin in recent months. Supporters of Ms. Marion, the Democrat running for state senator, handed out postcards with a Maple Dunker cookie recipe from Ms. Marion, who raced through the crowd in a sparkly T-shirt, shaking hands.
In a state that was once seen as mostly blue but often flipped control back and forth, Democrats view the Wisconsin Senate as one of their most winnable openings. Republicans hold control of the chamber with an 18-15 margin, and Democrats have poured attention into several seats they see as particularly competitive.
The district Ms. Marion is trying to seize from a Republican incumbent includes small towns and dairy farms in a rolling, rural section of Southwestern Wisconsin that went for Mr. Trump in 2016, but also Barack Obama before that; it's a place strategists see as a swing district that could reflect Democrats' strength in the state this year.
Ms. Marion, a county board member who tends a small farm with a bed-and-breakfast, drew statewide attention a few years ago as part of efforts to pass legislation that became known as the "Cookie Bill." State law didn't authorize bakers to sell their goods at farmers' markets without commercial licenses, and she wanted to change that, but struggled to get anywhere with the Republican-controlled Legislature. Eventually, she was among a group that sued. A court ruling opened the way for such sales, but Ms. Marion saw the events as telling.
"How simple should that have been to get a cookie bill passed?" she said. "It was eye opening in terms of how you think you know what democracy is. I'm actually not super into baking cookies, but we just need more opportunities out here."
Not far from Ms. Marion along Main Street, supporters of her opponent, Sen. Howard Marklein, the Republican incumbent and an accountant who grew up on a dairy farm, were handing out Packers' game schedules and bright yellow Marklein bags to children collecting candy along the street. Mr. Marklein said that farmers are struggling but that his constituents tell him they see the state's economy as growing and vibrant.
"I've knocked on thousands of doors," Mr. Marklein said. "You talk to businesses, and these are the best years they've ever had."
Still, Ms. Marion's pitch is largely about economic survival and quality of life: Fix the roads. Expand broadband to the rural reaches. Send more money to rural schools.
Small towns are struggling, she said, with populations shrinking, schools closing and farmers wrestling with bankruptcies and a growing suicide problem.
"In towns like this, we're on the edge all the time," she said. "We want to stay here, but that is by no means a sure thing. It's sort of like we're at a crossroads. What's going to happen?"

Full text: The cost to borrow money is on the rise. That is bad news for home buyers and other prospective borrowers. It helped cause a stock market sell-off on Wednesday and Thursday, and prompted President Trump to say that the Federal Reserve has "gone crazy." But it amounts to good news for the long-term direction of the economy.
In effect, the multi-trillion dollar global bond market is signaling a little greater confidence than it did just a few weeks ago that the nine-year expansion in the United States may have room to keep going for years to come, and without inflation taking off.
The yield on 10-year United States Treasury bonds reached a seven-year high this week of 3.25 percent (it receded amid plunging stocks Wednesday and Thursday), up from 2.82 percent in August. The 10-year rate was below 1.4 percent as recently as July 2016.
But beyond those headline numbers, the details of how the prices of different types of securities have moved relative to one another tell a story that is decidedly optimistic.
For much of the last couple of years, short-term interest rates, which the Fed controls directly, have risen much faster than longer-term rates, which are set based on global supply and demand for bonds. The Fed was plowing ahead with rate increases, while investors were evidently skeptical that growth would be persistent enough to justify higher long-term rates.
In late August, the rate on 10-year government bonds was only 0.18 percent higher than for two-year government bonds, a phenomenon known as a flat yield curve. (When that number turns negative, it's considered an "inverted yield curve" and is often a measure of looming recession.)
Since then, longer-term rates have risen faster than shorter-term ones. While the yield curve remains flat by historical standards (the gap between 10-year and two-year bonds was up to only 0.33 percent in recent days), it has moved in a direction consistent with a more optimistic outlook.
"The long end of the yield curve has finally moved to the view that this could be a more persistent recovery," said Michelle Meyer, head of U.S. economics at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. "It's reflecting the possibility that this recovery has further legs."
But, crucially, the higher long-term interest rates don't seem to be driven by expectations that inflation will soar higher.
The yields of inflation-protected bonds have moved mostly in lock step with traditional bonds in recent weeks, suggesting that traders haven't become more worried about inflation.
For example, inflation of 2.16 percent a year over the coming decade was implied by the price gap between the two types of bonds as of the middle of last week, up only a smidgen since August and below its level in May.
The rise in longer-term interest rates is driven mainly not by a rise in inflation expectations, but rather by a rise in investors' expectations for what the Fed will do and for how much compensation bond investors are demanding in lending over long time horizons.
Leaders of the Fed have indicated that they expect to keep raising their target interest rate to around 3.4 percent by the end of 2020, up from the current level of just above 2 percent.
In previous years, financial markets have been doubtful that the Fed would follow through with its forecasts for rate increases. Now the Fed's own projections are consistent with the path of rate increases priced into markets.
"The market seems to have accepted the Fed's rate path," said Megan Greene, chief economist at Manulife Asset Management.
Moreover, Roberto Perli of Cornerstone Macro calculates that a big part of the higher rates is an increase in the "term premium." That means investors are demanding more compensation than they did a few weeks ago for tying their money up for many years. This implies they now see a greater possibility that growth and short-term interest rates could surprise by rising faster than forecasters now project.
"The markets are bringing up their expectations for growth, and have been bringing them up all year," Mr. Perli said. "The trend is clearly up, and the market is betting that will continue."
Add it all up, and it means the world's most savvy investors are betting that the United States economy will keep growing at a healthy clip, without inflation emerging, but that the Fed will have to keep raising rates well above current levels in order to prevent that inflation.
Of course, there are downsides to the higher rates. The recent stock market volatility has been fueled in part by the realization that higher rates will mean higher borrowing costs for corporations.
And the housing sector is especially sensitive to the longer-term interest rates set on the bond market, which in turn determine mortgage rates. Housing has already shown softness in some markets in recent months.
The average rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rose to 4.9 percent, from below 4 percent at the end of 2017, according to data from Freddie Mac.
"We are getting into that zone where the typical mortgage payment is increasing much faster than incomes, and that's going to put a brake on some markets," said Aaron Terrazas, a senior economist at the real estate site Zillow.
In effect, higher mortgage rates could depress the rate of price appreciation of houses, as home buyers cannot bid as aggressively for properties as they could when rates were lower.
And markets, even deep and liquid ones like the bond market, aren't always right, and are frequently wrong. No one would argue that the details of the yield curve, for example, offer some unassailable prediction of the future.
But for all the stock market palpitations and risks to particular interest-rate sensitive industries, the message to take from the recent rise in interest rates is an unambiguously good one: This expansion may have some life in it yet.

Full text: The more we learn about how people really think, the more we must rethink economic theory. Changes in fundamental beliefs play a major role in the fluctuations of the economy. That's the implication of two fascinating new studies that show how people systematically change their beliefs in thinking about the financial future. At the moment, the knowledge that economists have accumulated about this subject suggests that we should have a high degree of humility -- not only in forecasting where we are going, but in describing where we have been.
In a 2018 paper, Julian Kozlowski of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, Laura Veldkamp of Columbia University and Venky Venkateswaran of New York University attribute some of the economic pain that occurred after the 2008 financial crisis to a change in beliefs that may still be playing a role 10 years later.
Before financial tremors began to be felt in 2006, practically no one viewed a crisis of the magnitude of the Great Depression as being remotely possible, these authors say. The financial crisis changed that perspective, and people have continued to worry about this newly discovered threat, with the result that risk-taking has been inhibited and government-controlled interest rates -- so-called riskless rates -- have remained relatively low.
The scholars show that after an outlier event like the 2008 financial crisis occurs, standard statistical techniques show a sudden and persistent increase in the probability that such an event will occur again.
Now that such a financial crisis is forever in our data set, it is rational, they say, to continue to worry about another such crisis, even decades later. Those worries can hold back the economy.
Consider what this means for housing.
The real (inflation-corrected) S&P/CoreLogic/Case-Shiller National Home Price Index fell 36 percent from 2005 to 2012. Going all the way back to 1890, home prices had never fallen so sharply.
Before 2008, people might have rationally given the likelihood of such a fall a zero probability. Now that we have experienced it, the probability will never be zero again.
These scholars are correct, but the situation, in my view, is even worse than they imply. That's because there is evidence from behavioral economics that people are not entirely logical, and do not actually rely fully on logic or standard statistical techniques.
This behavioral economic perspective is embraced by Nicola Gennaioli of Bocconi University and Andrei Shleifer of Harvard University in their remarkable new book, "A Crisis of Beliefs" (Princeton University Press, 2018).
Focusing on the stock market, Professor Gennaioli and Professor Shleifer demonstrate how changeable expectations for the future really are. People tend to believe that recent trends will continue, whatever they may be, and then, when things shift, they change their expectations again.
These authors, referring to previous research with Robin Greenwood at Harvard, examined six separate surveys of expected returns on the stock market, some looking at individuals, and some focusing on professionals. The surveys correlated substantially with one another, showing that they were actually measuring popular beliefs about the stock market.
But Professor Gennaioli and Professor Shleifer also showed that these expectations for future returns were systematically wrong, showing no ability to predict what actually happened.
These kinds of mistakes tend to follow certain psychological laws. Professor Gennaioli and Professor Shleifer stress that people have what they call "diagnostic beliefs," a concept related to the "representativeness heuristic" described in 1974 by the psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky.
Diagnostic beliefs work like this: A physician, in trying to diagnose a patient's illness, orders a blood test that reliably gives a positive result for all patients who have a certain disease. Unfortunately, the test also gives many false positives. It is easy to assume the patient has the disease. But the test may just be a false positive.
The market boom leading to the 2008 financial crisis was the result of mistaken beliefs like the doctor's diagnostic errors, the researchers say. These diagnostic beliefs were based on what seemed to be a "kernel of truth," Professors Gennaioli and Shleifer say: Investors had a high return in the market. But they exaggerated the meaning of that kernel of truth, creating a market bubble.
More broadly, fundamental beliefs about the economy change through time. Thus, for example, the remarkable performance in the United States stock market since 2009 and in the housing market since 2012 are a result of a newly emergent belief system, reinforced not just by presidential statements or even by tax cuts but by a psychological dynamic that operates according to well-defined psychological principles, based, erroneously, on the belief that past growth in market prices is strong positive evidence for more growth in the near future.
The problem for economics research today is to try to clarify these changing belief systems, their impact on the economy, and their duration. Further study may well show that the economic effects of beliefs founded on false premises can be profound for decades after the initial changes take place.

Full text: Just weeks after Wall Street celebrated what by some yardsticks became the longest bull market in history, stocks dropped so sharply that it may have seemed prudent to wonder whether the newest bear market has begun. A 6.7 percent decline in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index in six trading sessions through Thursday nearly erased the 7.2 percent gain the index recorded in the third quarter. The market rebounded a bit on Friday. But even before the six-day plunge, the narrowness of the quarter's advance hinted that the market was on shakier ground than the peak reached in the period might have suggested.
The strong performance during the quarter was concentrated in American stocks, primarily of a handful of big-name technology companies, such as Amazon, Netflix, Apple and Alphabet, the parent company of Google. Markets fell almost everywhere else.
The gap between stock returns in the United States and elsewhere has led some -- but definitely not all -- strategists to conclude that for American investors, there are better prospects abroad.
"The U.S. is an expensive, frothy market priced to give you terrible forward returns," said Robert Arnott, chairman of the investment advisory service Research Affiliates, who is seeking opportunities in foreign markets.
On the other hand, Jonathan Golub, chief United States equity strategist at Credit Suisse, said the outperformance of the American market was justified -- and may well continue. "There's a huge difference between the U.S. economy and the rest of the world, and between the U.S. market and the rest of the world," he said. "The rest of the developed world has half as much growth, and it's the same with profits. It's a legitimate divergence. It's not solely a matter of sentiment."
Legitimate or not, the divergence between foreign and domestic markets -- and how much they cost -- accelerated in recent months. The Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-U.S. exchange-traded fund was down 4.9 percent in the year through September, while the SPDR S.&P. 500 E.T.F. rose 8.9 percent, helped by a 7.2 percent increase in the underlying index in the third quarter. Based on the ratio of share prices to book value, American stocks were more than twice as expensive in September as stocks in the rest of the world, according to Bank of America, a record premium.
Leading the laggards downward were emerging markets, several of which have plunged because of heavy amounts of foreign debt, and Europe, where indexes are heavily weighted in banks that are owed a lot of that money.
The comparative strength of domestic stocks has been justified by the superior performance of the American economy and the presence of so many high-quality, high-growth companies, investment advisers like Mr. Golub say. Others, like Mr. Arnott, counter that American business prospects cannot be marvelous enough to justify such a cavernous valuation discrepancy, especially over the medium-to-long haul. Foreign markets, especially in the developing world, are bound to bounce back and reward the patience of investors who take a chance on them, they say.
Mr. Arnott, for example, highlighted an array of measures showing that American stocks are expensive when compared with their own history or with foreign alternatives, especially in the developing world.
"Emerging market stocks are cheap," he said. "They have been whacked because of fears that a trade war will do these economies great damage." With valuations at half the levels of American stocks', he said, "they're reflecting the worst case, not the most likely case."
Bonds issued in the developing world also offer good value, in his view. Debt denominated in local currencies yields 6 percent or more, double what long-term Treasury issues offer.
Yet emerging market assets may not seem like bargains to anyone familiar with the currency collapses and economic difficulties besetting countries like Turkey and Argentina. Lower stock prices or an extra three or four points of yield may be small compensation for the possibility of further currency losses or the added risk of default.
But those countries account for a minuscule fraction of emerging stock and bond markets. Other places are on more solid economic and financial footing, although it might take a while before recognition sets in that they're still moving in the right direction.
"The emerging market story is intact, but you have to have a longer-term focus; emerging markets are still not for the faint of heart," said Elizabeth Morrissey, managing partner of Kleiman International Consultants. "The best bets in these markets continue to be the ones growing strongly."
Strong, persistent economic growth, propelled in part by young, rising populations, can overcome occasional bouts of weakness in mature economies, policy errors at home, large foreign debts and other unfavorable conditions, she said.
Indonesia, for instance, one of her favorite markets, runs large fiscal and current-account deficits, Ms. Morrissey said. The country owes a lot of money to foreign lenders, and its currency, the rupiah, is trading near where it was during the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s, but economic growth is at a five-year high.
India, another favorite, also runs large deficits and has a weak currency. On top of that, India is "massively oil reliant," she said. But its economy grew at an 8.2 percent annual rate in the second quarter, driven by the country's dynamic private sector.
"There are still significant portions of the populations in these countries striving for an iPhone," Ms. Morrissey said. "There's still a significant growth story."
The arguments for investing in the United States are strong, too. Measures of consumer and business sentiment are close to all-time highs. The September reading of the Conference Board index of consumer confidence, for example, was the highest since 2000.
If Americans have felt pleased with life and expressed their satisfaction by buying domestic stocks, the last several days notwithstanding, it's with good reason, Mr. Golub said.
He pointed out that the United States has more dynamic businesses than places like Europe. American stock indexes are heavily weighted toward technology companies, while European indexes have a larger proportion of banks, which have been struggling in part because of their extensive exposure to lenders in the developing world.
Fund returns in the third quarter confirmed the outperformance but not by as much as you might expect from the moves in the underlying assets. The average domestic stock fund rose 5 percent, according to Morningstar, led by portfolios specializing in health care, energy and technology. The average international fund gained 0.1 percent, depressed by losses in India and China funds.
The average taxable bond fund returned 0.7 percent in the period.
Rebecca Patterson, chief investment officer of Bessemer Trust, also finds the discrepancy in investment returns justified.
"The U.S. leadership this year is a reflection of diverging fundamentals in different parts of the world," she said. "Significant stimulus" -- from the Federal Reserve until recently and then from a big round of tax cuts -- "has helped lift corporate earnings. I'm not surprised that the U.S. is outperforming by so much this year. I guess the question is: Can the outperformance last?"
It's a tough one to answer in a world of interconnected economies. Some developments that would worsen conditions at home might cause even greater damage abroad, Ms. Patterson said, while favorable domestic developments might provide a greater lift elsewhere.
If the Fed has second thoughts about monetary tightening and turns more dovish, for instance, it could depress the dollar, easing pressures on foreign economies with large debts denominated in dollars. "The rest of the world could catch up," she said.
By contrast, an acceleration of the slow-motion trade war that has been worrying investors all year -- although not enough to put much of a crimp in market returns -- would hurt the domestic economy, but it could damp growth to a much greater extent in places like China, she said. A slowdown in China, in turn, would have a more serious impact on Europe than the United States.
Another potential impediment to European markets, Ms. Patterson said, is the imminent start of a monetary tightening cycle by the European Central Bank. The Fed has been far more hawkish on inflation, but its European counterpart may soon join it in raising interest rates and selling assets acquired in its quantitative easing program.
With such prospects, she prefers to maintain a particularly high allocation to domestic stocks. But favorable moves on the trade front would persuade her to put more into emerging markets, particularly China.
Mr. Golub contends that investors have "almost an obsession with what could go wrong" for American stocks, although he acknowledged that "if people were really cautious, the market wouldn't be going up" as it did in the third quarter.
He also highlighted a number of factors that are "a risk but not a problem," including inflation, the elections next month and the trade backdrop. He said that valuations are not cheap and that long-term returns could suffer for that.
"There is an unbelievable number of potential threats to the stock market, but none of them are derailing the market yet," Mr. Golub said.
The last word in that quote might worry some investors, especially lately, but he recommends owning some of the highest of fliers, including technology stocks that focus on consumer services, such as Priceline and Amazon, and on communication services, including Netflix, Alphabet and Facebook. He also favors financial companies.
If there are risks but not problems in the United States, as Mr. Golub put it, Nick Kaiser, manager of the Sextant International fund, finds problems but not as much risk overseas.
"There are more opportunities in foreign markets than domestic," Mr. Kaiser said. Even a country like Argentina "is a great place to invest," he said, as long as the money is put to work in stocks when they trade at low valuations, and not bonds, which are far more susceptible to inflation.
His strategy is to look for high-quality companies, even if the quality of the economy in places where they do business may be suspect. An example in Argentina is MercadoLibre, an online retailer that operates across South America.
Other portfolio holdings that Mr. Kaiser mentioned include Dassault Systèmes, a French engineering company; Nice, an Israeli cybersecurity concern; and two Dutch businesses: the consumer electronics company Philips, and ASML Holding, a maker of semiconductor manufacturing equipment.
"We see a lot of opportunities in Europe," he said, "but there may be more in Argentina and Brazil."
Mr. Arnott likewise sees a world full of healthy investment prospects. He finds it easier to list what he would avoid than what he would buy.
"There's a richer spread of opportunity than usual, just not in the U.S.," he said. "You just need a little upside surprise and you've got a bull market."

Full text: For the first time since the financial crisis, playing it safe is paying off for income investors. After a decade when conservative money market funds and similar short-term investments yielded close to zero, it is now possible to earn about 2 percent and even a bit more.
Vanguard Prime Money Market fund yields more than 2 percent. A six-month Treasury bill yields 2.4 percent, up from 0.6 percent at the beginning of 2017. Ally Bank pays a 3 percent annual yield on a five-year certificate of deposit, with an early withdrawal fee equal to five months of interest. Goldman Sachs's online consumer bank, Marcus, pays 1.95 percent on a savings account.
Money invested in savings and C.D. bank accounts is guaranteed to hold its value. Money market mutual funds lack an outright guarantee but are designed to deliver the same steady ride. In both instances, you've got no downside risk and your upside is the interest you earn.
Lately, pocketing a 2 percent to 3 percent return owning cash is better than the performance of popular core bond funds that track the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index.
That's because bond fund returns have two components: the interest paid by the bonds and changes in bond prices. When interest rates rise, prices fall. A bond statistic called duration estimates a portfolio's sensitivity to rate changes; the longer a portfolio's duration, the bigger its price loss when rates rise.
Core bond funds that track the aggregate index have a duration of around six years, considered intermediate-term in bond parlance. That means when interest rates rise one percentage point, the index's bond prices will fall 6 percent. Over the past year, rising interest rates lifted the yield on core bond funds above 3 percent, but that was not enough income to offset price declines.
The iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF, which tracks the index, is down 1.9 percent over the last 12 months. IShares 0-5 Year Investment Grade Corporate Bond fund ETF, with a duration below three years, has a positive return of 0.2 percent.
"The boost in yield you get from owning intermediate- and longer-term bonds is very, very low, and you are taking a lot more risk," said Michael Fredericks, head of income investing for the BlackRock Multi-Asset Strategies group. That it's now possible to earn something on shorter-term investments "changes the calculus a lot in the way you think about things," Mr. Fredericks said.
Over the last year, the BlackRock Multi-Asset Income fund, which he helps manage, has shifted the portion of its portfolio that invests in traditional bonds from intermediate-term issues to shorter-term investment-grade bonds and cash. The fund's average duration is less than three years. That provides a defensive foundation yielding 3 percent or so, as the managers focus most of the $16 billion fund on investments that offer higher yields, such as preferred stocks, high-yield bonds and floating rate loans.
Kathy Jones, chief fixed-income strategist at the Schwab Center for Financial Research, says she is concerned that investors are becoming too defensive. "When I go out and talk to clients, all of a sudden everybody is sitting in T Bills or cash equivalents," said Ms. Jones, referring to short-term Treasury securities and bank investments that mature in less than one year.
Morningstar Direct reports that ultrashort-term bond funds -- portfolios with durations below one year -- have had the highest net inflows among all types of taxable bond funds for six consecutive months through August.
"Implicitly, that is trying to time the market," Ms. Jones said, and such behavior can hurt investor returns.
Ms. Jones pointed out that intermediate-term bonds have historically been the better diversification counterweight when stocks fall. "T bills will hold their value, but a five-year bond will actually do pretty well" in such a situation, she said.
For example, in the 12 months through February 2009 -- the heart of the last stock meltdown -- intermediate-term bonds rallied 5 percent and Treasury bills gained 1.3 percent.
Moreover, if you're worried about a bond bear market, it's time to check your rearview mirror.
With inflation still in check, expectations are that longer-term interest rates may already be near a peak. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note has risen to 3.1 percent recently from 1.4 percent in July 2016.
That means you and your core bond fund have probably already lived through what passes for a bond bear market in this economic cycle. The aggregate index has lost a grand total of less than two percentage points since July 2016.
Ms. Jones says the sweet spot for investors is a fixed-income portfolio with an average duration from two to five years. Yields in that range are about 90 percent of the 10-year Treasury yield, with a lot less downside risk.
If your current fixed-income strategy is simply to own a core bond fund that tracks the aggregate index, you can reduce the duration by adding shorter-term mutual funds or exchange-traded funds, or even cash.
Shifting some money out of a core bond fund can also be an opportunity to add diversification in securities that are not included in the index.
"High-yield bonds, preferred stocks, floating rate debt, emerging markets are opportunities that can increase your fixed-income diversification," said Terri Spath, chief investment officer at Sierra Investment Management.
Ms. Spath says she sees good value in municipal bonds today. New muni bond issuance is down significantly from last year, when there was a big rush to float new bonds at a time of fear that tax reform would strip away the tax deductibility of municipal bond interest. The new tax law did not affect the treatment of muni interest, as it turned out, and Ms. Spath now has nearly 30 percent of the Sierra Tactical Core Income Fund invested in high- yield municipal bonds.
She says that with no recession on the near-term horizon, strong corporate earnings, low unemployment and rising wage growth, she is comfortable seeking the higher yields in lower-rated issues as municipalities are raking in plenty of tax and fee revenue to cover their interest payments. The S&P Municipal Bond High Yield Index has a current yield of 4.3 percent, compared with 2.8 percent for the S&P Municipal Bond Investment Grade Index.
With the same outlook for the economy, Mr. Fredericks said he had placed nearly 30 percent of the BlackRock Multi-Asset Income fund's assets in high-yield corporate bonds and floating rate loans, which are usually high-yield issues. That said, BlackRock is being careful, he said. "Our focus is on higher-quality high yield. Even if we find ourselves in recession, those companies are better positioned to weather it," he said.
The resurrection of short-term yields merits two more portfolio considerations.
Anyone who has been using dividend-paying stocks as a bond substitute since the financial crisis might want to revisit that strategy. The 2.4 percent yield of the SPDR S&P Dividend ETF is about what you can earn on cash and short-term bonds these days, but the risk of holding stocks is higher, especially in Year 9 of a bull market. "It's hard for us to envision double-digit returns from dividend-paying stocks, but if there was a growth scare, you could certainly envision double-digit downside," said Mr. Fredericks.
And if you have money parked in a brokerage sweep account, you might want to reconsider how much is sitting there. According to Crane Data, such accounts yield just 0.22 percent, on average, as firms are moving the accounts from higher-yielding money market mutual funds -- with an average yield of 1.8 percent -- into bank accounts that pay a lot less to investors but generate nice fees for the brokerages.
Once you've got your tweaking done, you might relax. "The whole idea of fixed income is you don't have to worry about it if you have it invested properly," Ms. Jones said.

Full text: October is living up to its ominous reputation among stock investors. Stocks on Wall Street tumbled again on Thursday, as choppy early trading gave way to another bout of broad-based selling. The declines were widespread, touching everything from previously high-flying tech shares to usually insulated sectors like consumer staples and utilities.
When the dust settled, every sector of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index had dropped, leaving the stock market benchmark down an additional 2.1 percent. That slump followed Wednesday's 3.3 percent decline, which was the market's biggest dive in eight months.
So far in October -- which looms large in the minds of investors as the month of the 1929 and 1987 crashes -- stocks are down 6.4 percent. That puts the month on a pace to be the worst October for stocks since 2008, when they fell nearly 17 percent.
"Today it feels a lot more like there's just money coming out of the market," said John Linehan, chief investment officer for equities at T. Rowe Price in Baltimore. "I think there's a level of anxiety about the market, especially given how far we've come."
Early Friday, markets in Asia suggested the damage could be moderating, as Chinese shares matched Wall Street's drop but stocks in Japan, Hong Kong and elsewhere in the region were largely flat.
Investors who have ridden the nearly decade-long bull market in stocks are now contending with a growing crop of concerns, including rising borrowing costs that could dampen economic growth and growing tensions between the United States and China. Worries about rising interest rates eased briefly early in the day after a report showing muted inflation helped send yields on government bonds lower. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note ended the day just below 3.15 percent, lower than it had been in several days.
But the easing of rates did little to comfort investors who are also worrying about deteriorating relations between Washington and Beijing. On Wednesday, United States officials said they had charged a Chinese intelligence official with espionage after he was extradited from Belgium. On Thursday, the Department of Energy said it would tighten controls on Chinese imports of civil nuclear technology.
Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, warned on Thursday that if the tensions between the United States and China continued to escalate, "the global economy would take a significant hit."
"Our strong recommendation," Ms. Lagarde said at a meeting in Bali, Indonesia, "is to de-escalate those tensions and to work toward a global trade system that is stronger, that is fairer, and that is fit for purpose and fit for the future."
Reflecting concerns about the global economy, commodity prices also tumbled on Thursday, with the decline in oil prices, for example, weighing on shares of energy producers.
Earlier in the day, stocks were hit particularly hard in Asia, where no market was spared in the sweeping sell-off. Stocks in Shanghai, Tokyo, Hong Kong and Seoul, South Korea, dropped 4 percent or more.
Stocks in China have been declining for months amid signs of economic softness and worries about the impact of President Trump's trade war. Over the weekend, the People's Bank of China pumped $175 billion into the economy to help shore it up. Worried about the impact of negative information on its citizens, China has censored negative economic news.
Shares also fell in Europe on Thursday, though the declines were less extreme than in the United States or Asia. The region is also vulnerable to a long list of economic risks, including the possibility of a disorderly exit by Britain from the European Union and the potential for Italy to provoke a new eurozone debt crisis.
Italy's populist government has drafted a spending plan that would defy European budget rules to fulfill election promises. The market interest rates on Italian bonds have spiked as investors worry that the country may not be able to service its debt, which is equivalent to more than 130 percent of annual economic output.
While geopolitical issues have sprung to the fore, subtler shifts in the backdrop of the stock market might be producing outsize reactions. With the bulk of the earnings season about to start on Friday, many American companies have paused their share repurchase programs to comply with blackout periods, potentially worsening stock market swings.
"That's another level of support that's sort of gone in this period," said Marina Severinovsky, an investment strategist at the asset manager Schroders.
More broadly, investors are readjusting to the slow withdrawal of support from central banks -- such as the Federal Reserve -- which has acted as a tailwind for stocks since the market rally began in March 2009.
The Fed says it will continue to lift interest rates in the face of robust economic growth, despite direct criticism of the policy from Mr. Trump in recent days.
The Fed is also starting to significantly shrink its balance sheet, effectively withdrawing some of the money it pumped into the financial system during and after the financial crisis a decade ago.
"I think these are kind of the teething pains for asset markets as we kind of get away from super-easy money," said Michael Feroli, chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase.

Full text: President Trump responded to falling stock prices on Thursday by continuing to throw rocks at the Federal Reserve, which he has described as "crazy," "loco," "going wild" and "out of control" for slowly raising interest rates against the backdrop of a booming economy. No other modern president has publicly attacked the Fed with such venom or frequency. Indeed, some scholars said the only close historical parallel was with President Andrew Jackson, who campaigned successfully in the 1830s to close the Fed's predecessor, the Second Bank of the United States.
Mr. Trump's pointed remarks reflect the high political stakes less than a month before midterm elections that have been cast by his political opponents as a referendum on his presidency. Mr. Trump has been riding the economy hard, bragging about job creation, tax cuts and reduced federal regulation, and claiming credit for the rise of the stock market. Now that the market has lost 5 percent of its value in the last week, Mr. Trump is insisting someone else is to blame.
The Standard & Poor's 500 stock index closed at 2,728.37 on Thursday, down 2.06 percent.
In fact, despite the stock market's plunge, the American economy continues to grow, which is what is prompting the Fed to raise interest rates and drawing the president's ire. The Fed's chairman, Jerome H. Powell, has said that the economy is in a "particularly bright moment" and that he sees no clouds on the horizon.
The stock market sell-off instead appears to reflect the movement of money into bonds, a normal consequence of higher interest rates since those securities pay more as rates rise; concern about the health of the global economy; and hesitations about the value of tech stocks.
But after hitching his political fortunes to the rise of the stock market, Mr. Trump is now looking to decouple himself from its fall. Republicans are instead emphasizing continued economic growth and the lowest unemployment rate since 1969.
So far, the president's comments have made little impression on market expectations about Fed policy. Unlike Jackson's concerted campaign, Mr. Trump's attacks appear curiously unmoored from the policies of his own administration or the longstanding goals of the Republican Party. Mr. Trump's own aides have insisted that the president's remarks are personal musings, not an attempt to dictate policy.
The Fed has also brushed off the attacks; it still expected to raise rates in December for the fourth time this year.
Mr. Powell, selected for the job by Mr. Trump, said at a September news conference that Mr. Trump's views would not influence the Fed's decisions. "We don't consider political factors or things like that," Mr. Powell said. "That's who we are, that's what we do, and that's just the way it's always going to be for us."
Mr. Powell emphasized that the decision to raise rates to a range between 2 and 2.25 percent was not intended to get in the way of continued growth. "My colleagues and I are doing all we can to keep the economy strong, healthy and moving forward," he said.
A spokeswoman declined to comment on Thursday.
Some experts warned that a continued assault on the Fed could have long-lasting consequences.
Peter Conti-Brown, a professor of legal studies at the University of Pennsylvania and the author of a political history of the Fed, pointed to the example of the F.B.I., another institution Mr. Trump has repeatedly attacked by raising questions about the integrity of its decision making. Mr. Conti-Brown said technocratic institutions are insulated from political pressure by public confidence. If confidence erodes, it becomes harder for technocrats to resist the politicians.
The F.B.I. has seen a loss of leadership, an erosion of morale and an increase in congressional scrutiny.
"How long before the Fed is looking at its political context and saying, 'We can't stick our heads out as far as we need to,"' Mr. Conti-Brown asked rhetorically. "How long will people stay if the job itself becomes terrible, and there are protesters everywhere you go?"
Mr. Trump criticized the Fed when it raised interest rates in July, and again when it raised interest rates in September. But his attacks have sharply intensified in recent days, in tandem with the drop in the stock market.
"I think the Fed has gone crazy," he told reporters on Wednesday afternoon. Later in the day, speaking with Fox News, he continued to increase the heat. "The Fed is going wild," he said. "I don't know what their problem is. They are raising interest rates and it's ridiculous."
"It's not right," he said Thursday. "It's not necessary, and I think I know more about it than they do."
Mr. Trump added that he was "disappointed" with Mr. Powell but did not plan to fire him -- an authority the president may not even have. While the president in theory has the power to remove a Fed chairman "for cause," courts have held that the permissible causes do not include policy disagreements.
For the moment, Mr. Trump's criticism of the Fed does not seem to be catching on with Republican candidates. Many Republicans have argued for years that the Fed was waiting too long to raise interest rates, and then that it was moving too slowly. The party is trying to hold on to majorities in the Senate and the House by running on a strong economy and using the heated liberal opposition to Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh's Supreme Court confirmation as an example of the threat Democrats pose if they control Congress. That dynamic could change, however, if the stock market continues to fall.
Modern presidents have always kept an uneasy eye on the Fed, because its decisions about monetary policy have a significant influence on the pace of economic growth.
Until the early 1950s, the Fed essentially operated as an arm of the Treasury Department. Even after the Fed gained operational independence, presidents often opined publicly about what the Fed should do and, if the Fed ignored their advice, they sometimes sought to bend its officials to their will.
President Lyndon B. Johnson protested a decision to raise interest rates in the late 1960s by summoning the Fed chairman at the time, William McChesney Martin, to his East Texas ranch and pinning the smaller man against a wall. President Richard M. Nixon instructed aides to blackmail Mr. Martin's successor, Arthur Burns. President George Bush declared in a State of the Union address that the Fed should keep rates low.
But the volume of public commentary greatly diminished in recent decades as politicians concluded that pressuring the Fed was counterproductive. The administrations of Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama all made a policy of silence on monetary policy.
Krishna Guha, the head of the central bank strategy team at Evercore ISI, said he did not expect Mr. Trump's remarks to influence the Fed, and he saw no evidence that markets were paying attention. But he added that if Mr. Trump did succeed, he would most likely regret doing so.
If Mr. Trump's attacks convince markets that the Fed may move more slowly, or show greater tolerance of inflation, bond yields would rise, which would put further downward pressure on equity prices.
Still, Mr. Guha -- formerly a senior official at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York -- said that the president's criticisms were not good for the central bank or the future conduct of economic policy.
"You never want to be in a position where some part of society doesn't just question whether you made the right call or not, but whether you made that call in the public interest," he said.
Mr. Trump's aides have sought to play down his broadsides. Larry Kudlow, the president's top economic adviser, said Mr. Trump was just offering his two cents. "I don't think he's 'calling out the Fed,' quote unquote," Mr. Kudlow told reporters outside the White House on Thursday morning. "I really mean this. I think he's giving you his opinion. He is a, obviously, successful businessman, he's a very well-informed investor. He has his views. But he's not saying to them, 'Change your plan."'
Mr. Kudlow added, "He knows the Fed is independent, and he respects that."
Mr. Trump's criticisms appear strangely at odds with the way he has handled the most powerful means at his disposal to influence monetary policy. Since taking office less than two years ago, he has had the unusual opportunity to fill six of the seven seats on the Fed's board of governors.
He filled the top three positions on the Fed's board, including the chairman's job, with members of the Republican policymaking establishment, which has long been committed to keeping inflation firmly under control. Three other nominees, still awaiting confirmation, are a more diverse group, but there is no indication any share Mr. Trump's stated opposition to raising interest rates.
"In most areas of administrative policy that have been highly politicized, his appointments have privileged politics over competence," Mr. Conti-Brown said. "The Fed has been an exception."
A looming question, he said, is whether Mr. Trump might begin to match his actions to his words.

Full text: ANKARA, Turkey -- President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey has long cast himself as a champion of the Arab Spring uprisings and the political Islamists who once seemed poised to ride them to power. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia anchors the opposite camp in an ideological battle raging across the Middle East: the anti-Islamist strongmen who quashed the revolts.
The two leaders, each the head of a major regional power, have until now kept their relations cordial in the interest of stability. But over the past week, tensions between them have erupted over the disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi dissident and Washington Post columnist who vanished after entering the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul nine days ago.
Mr. Erdogan has repeatedly challenged Saudi Arabia to explain Mr. Khashoggi's disappearance, while Turkish officials say they have video and audio evidence proving he was killed, and have unleashed a stream of leaks suggesting that the royal court ordered it. The crown prince and his spokesmen have insisted, without providing evidence, that Mr. Khashoggi left the consulate freely, professing that they, too, are worried about him.
The dispute pits two staunch, headstrong nationalists against each other -- both with ambitions to reshape their region. They also share an aversion to public criticism and a history of refusing to back down from a fight.
"These are two people who each think he is the most important person in the Muslim world," said Steven A. Cook, a scholar at the Council on Foreign Relations who studies both countries. "Ego is a factor on both sides."
On Thursday, there were signs that the two leaders were looking for a way out. Mr. Erdogan's office announced that he had agreed to a Saudi request to form a joint "working group" that will examine Mr. Khashoggi's disappearance.
Certainly, each man has much to lose.
Mr. Erdogan is struggling to manage a teetering economy and his entanglement in war-torn Syria. He can ill afford a new battle with a deep-pocketed regional power like Saudi Arabia.
For Prince Mohammed, the affair threatens to severely damage the image of moderate reformer that he has worked for years to cultivate. Eager to diversify the Saudi economy before it runs out of oil, he has courted Washington, Wall Street, Silicon Valley and Hollywood with promises to open up and modernize the kingdom.
The prince has already endured his share of criticism in the West for leading a devastating war in Yemen, temporarily detaining the prime minister of Lebanon, and locking up hundreds of businessmen in a luxury hotel on suspicion of corruption. If he is held responsible for Mr. Khashoggi's disappearance -- and perhaps death -- that could strengthen domestic enemies bruised by his swift rise to power.
Internationally, it is already undermining his courtship of Western visitors and investors. Several participants said Thursday that they were dropping out of an investment conference known as Davos in the Desert that the prince is hosting this month in Riyadh.
"His credibility in the West and in the U.S. is at stake," said Kristian Coates Ulrichsen, a fellow at the Baker Institute for Public Policy at Rice University. "The credibility gap is going to be huge, and the Saudi boosters in D.C. are going to find it extremely difficult to portray the image that they were generally quite successful in trying to push."
With lawmakers from both parties in Washington now threatening to seek sanctions over the case, Saudi leaders appear surprised by the magnitude of the international reaction. Prince Mohammed has canceled or postponed meetings with diplomats and other foreign visitors, and Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir has been unusually quiet.
Mr. Erdogan, for his part, has almost taunted the crown prince with questions, testing how close he can come to blaming Saudi Arabia for Mr. Khashoggi's disappearance without explicitly doing so.
"Is it possible that there is no camera system at a consulate, an embassy?" he said, according to Turkish news reports. "Is it possible there was no camera system in the Saudi Arabian Consulate where this incident happened? I mean, if a bird flies from here, a mosquito flies, those systems would capture it. And they have the most advanced ones."
"It is not possible for us to remain silent about such an incident happening in our country," Mr. Erdogan said.
Mr. Erdogan's greatest concern is not foreign but domestic: borrowing taken on during his 15-year drive to build up the Turkish economy has left its corporate sector sagging under the weight of more than $200 billion in foreign debt. That has dragged down the value of Turkish currency, spurring high inflation.
Although Saudi Arabia is hardly its biggest investor, Turkish officials have boasted that their country did $8 billion a year in business with the kingdom. Wealthy Saudi holidaymakers are a staple of Istanbul's tourist industry.
"The stakes are very high, and that is why Erdogan will be very restrained," said Ozgur Unluhisarcikli, the Ankara office director of the German Marshall Fund of the United States. "Turkey is going through hard economic times, and Saudi Arabia and the Gulf countries have the ability to tip the balance of Turkey's economy."
The disappearance of Mr. Khashoggi also threatens something less tangible: the prestige Mr. Erdogan's Turkey has enjoyed around the region as a refuge for Arab politicians and thinkers under pressure from their own governments.
"Because Turkey has become such a haven for Arabs who no longer feel safe in their own countries, there is a lot of reputational damage for Erdogan," said Tamara Cofman Wittes, a scholar at the Brookings Institution and a former State Department official.
Several analysts said they already saw hints that Mr. Erdogan might be exploring a face-saving retreat for both sides -- for example, by allowing the crown prince to acknowledge Mr. Khashoggi's death but pin the blame on some rogue element in his government.
The announcement of the joint working group in the case added to the speculation. But how that cooperation might work, given the Turkish allegations against the Saudis, remains to be seen.
Over the years, Mr. Erdogan and Prince Mohammed have worked to suppress their differences.
When the Turkish leader cracked down after a failed military coup two years ago, Saudi Arabia was quick to help him, extraditing a Turkish military attaché suspected of playing a role in the plot. Mr. Erdogan singled out the kingdom for special thanks, and Prince Mohammed reciprocated by joining his father, King Salman, in congratulating Mr. Erdogan on his survival.
When Egyptian newspapers recently quoted Prince Mohammed calling Turkey part of an "evil" alliance in the region, he hastened to deny it, issuing a statement that he was criticizing the Islamists of the Muslim Brotherhood, not the government of Turkey.
But tensions between them still rose.
Mr. Erdogan remains close to the Muslim Brotherhood, which Saudi Arabia considers a national security threat and has branded as a terrorist organization. Turkey has also remained close to Qatar, another regional friend to the Brotherhood.
As he has consolidated power, Prince Mohammed has become increasingly bold. At age 33, he has charmed younger Saudis and many in the West by promising to diversify the Saudi economy and weaken the kingdom's religious authorities. He has let women drive and allowed concerts and movie theaters -- all novelties for the kingdom.
On a tour of the United States this year, Prince Mohammed was welcomed as a statesman. He met with President Trump; dined with Rupert Murdoch; had his picture taken with Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, Bill Gates, and Tim Cook of Apple; and hung out with the actor known as The Rock.
But many of his actions have backfired.
His military intervention in Yemen has so far produced only a stalemate and humanitarian crisis. His detention of the prime minister of Lebanon was ultimately ineffectual. And his imprisonment without due process of hundreds of wealthy businessmen, including several of his royal cousins, unnerved many of the investors he had set out to woo.
And now there are the allegations about Mr. Khashoggi.
Ms. Wittes, the Brookings scholar, said that if the Saudis "are willing to assassinate a journalist on foreign soil because he was mildly critical, these international partners are going to be much less likely to send their students, researchers and experts to the kingdom or to set up long-term partnerships with the kingdom."
Being seen in the eyes of the world as responsible for such a grisly assassination might once have been enough to disqualify a crown prince from succession to the Saudi throne. But Prince Mohammed, who is known as MBS, appears to have amassed more control than any leader in decades over the sources of hard power in the kingdom -- the military, the national guard and the Interior Ministry -- as well as the oil ministry.
Many analysts say there is almost no one left to challenge him -- provided he maintains the good will of his elderly father.
"There is no real coalition that can mobilize against MBS," said Mr. Ulrichsen, the Middle East fellow. "He seems to be secure in his position. And that seems to be the reason we see such actions."

Stocks Plummet, Signaling Anxiety on Wall Street

Full text: Stocks suffered their steepest drop in eight months on Wednesday, as rising interest rates gnawed at investors and as previously high-flying technology shares tumbled in the face of growing tensions with China. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 3.3 percent, registering its fifth consecutive daily decline. That's the longest string of down days for the S.&P. 500, the market's benchmark, since November 2016. The damage continued on Thursday in Asia, as markets in China, Japan and Hong Kong fell about 3 percent in morning trading.
The decline signaled a change in mood on Wall Street. For months, it had seemed as though nothing could spook stock investors in the United States. Growing corporate profits and surging shares of technology giants pushed major benchmarks to a string of record highs.
But concerns about nascent inflation, rising interest rates and the potential for the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy came together into a wave of selling Wednesday. In addition, President Trump's policies toward Beijing have become a drag on technology companies, which rely heavily on China as a manufacturing base. Shares of the companies that make components like semiconductors have been particularly hard hit in the recent selling. Apple shares, for example, slid over 4.5 percent on Wednesday.
"It looks as though Trump is settling most of the trade skirmishes around the world that he started earlier this year with one important exception," said Ed Yardeni, president of the stock market research firm Yardeni Research. "It looks like China is going to be a long-term issue."
In recent days, interest rates on government bonds -- which serve as a baseline for mortgages and other loans -- have climbed to levels last seen in 2011, and that's making them a key concern for stock market investors.
Rising interest rates are something of a double-edged sword. They reflect the strength of the American economy, where unemployment is at 49-year lows, but they also mean borrowers looking to buy a home or a car, or invest in a business, will have to pay more to do so. Conventional 30-year mortgage rates are about 5 percent, for example, hurting both home affordability and the share price of home builders.
"Stock markets like rising interest rates because they tend to signal a strong economic backdrop," said Jonathan Golub, chief United States equity strategist for Credit Suisse. "That said, stock markets do not like very abrupt, large moves."
President Trump, who has boasted about the stock market rally as shares climbed, took Wednesday's sell-off as an opportunity to criticize the Federal Reserve, which has also been raising the short-term interest rates under its control. Mr. Trump had previously expressed his displeasure with that policy.
"The Fed is making a mistake," he said when asked by reporters about the market drop, shortly after landing in Erie, Pa., before a campaign rally. "I think the Fed has gone crazy." He described the recent selling as "a correction that we've been waiting for, for a long time."
But some policies put into place under Mr. Trump, like tax cuts and increased government spending that have widened the federal deficit, are also a factor in the rise in borrowing costs.
The worsening tensions between the Trump administration and China also drew blame for the drop on Wednesday.
Earlier in the day, the Treasury Department imposed new rules making it easier to block foreign investment in technology companies on national security grounds, outlining a rigorous review system that is aimed primarily at preventing China from gaining access to sensitive American technology.
"There's an increasing realization in the market that this is not just about the trade deficit. This is about security concerns. This is about geopolitical strength," said Evan Brown, director of asset allocation at UBS Asset Management. "It's about encouraging U.S. companies to move their supply chains out of China. And so there are questions about a broader disruption and potential legislation or scrutiny in these markets."
Despite the tumble on Wednesday, many market observers expect strong third-quarter earnings will be enough to help stocks recover their recent losses. Those reports will start to flow in earnest this Friday, when some of the largest United States banks, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup, will post results.
Thanks to the strength of the economy and steep cuts in corporate tax rates, corporate earnings are expected to rise more than 20 percent from the third quarter of 2017, according to John Butters, an earnings analyst with FactSet. That would be the third consecutive quarter of earnings growth of more than 20 percent.
But that outlook isn't without risks. As the economy heats up, costs are climbing and starting to eat into relatively fat profit margins.
On Wednesday, Fastenal, a company that makes products like industrial supplies used on factory floors, reported better-than-expected profit and sales numbers. But its profit margin was something of a disappointment and the stock fell more than 7 percent.
"We are starting to see some margin pressure from higher raw materials and energy and labor costs," said Savita Subramanian, equity strategist with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Still, she stressed that strong economic demand should support corporate profits, even if margins contract.
That's one reason she thinks the stock market remains an attractive place for investors, even with rising inflation and interest rates.
"I would stick with equities for the time being," she said.

Indexes Finish Mixed as Interest Rates Take a Breather

Full text: U.S. stock indexes ended Tuesday nearly where they began, as interest rates let off the accelerator following their sharp rise last week. But the modest moves for indexes masked some roiling underneath. Raw-material producers plunged on worries that inflation and weaker demand are eating into their profits. On the opposite end were technology stocks and other sectors, which recovered some of the sharp losses caused by last week's rapid rise in interest rates.
Altogether, the crosscurrents left the S&P 500 down 4.09 points, or 0.1 percent, at 2,880.34. It had waffled between small gains and losses for most of the day, and roughly three stocks fell in the index for every two that rose.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 56.21, or 0.2 percent, to 26,430.57, and the Nasdaq composite added 2.07, or less than 0.1 percent, to 7,738.02.
At the center of the movements were interest rates, which sway how quickly the economy grows, how expensive it is for companies and households to borrow and how high a price investors are willing to pay for stocks. The yield on the 10-year Treasury dipped to 3.20 percent from 3.22 late Friday in the first day of trading after bond markets were closed for a holiday on Monday.
The pause came after bond yields surged last week following several encouraging reports on the economy. The 10-year Treasury yield was just 3.05 percent last Tuesday, and the speed of the recent rise has been more concerning to investors than the level. If rates go high enough, they can hurt profits for companies and drive investors away from stocks and into bonds.
Tuesday's ease in rates helped technology stocks, which have been leading the market, both on the way up for most of the past year and on the way down over the last week. Technology companies are producing some of the biggest profit growth in the market, but their stocks are also trading at relatively high prices relative to those earnings.
Tech stocks in the S&P 500 are down 3 percent so far this month, versus a 1.2 percent loss for the overall index. But the group rose 0.4 percent Tuesday as interest rates dropped.
Energy stocks did even better, benefiting from another rise in the price of oil. Energy stocks in the S&P 500 climbed 1 percent, led by a 3.3 percent rise for Pioneer Natural Resources and a 2.7 percent climb for Apache.
"We like energy right now, and we think prices aren't likely to come down anytime soon," said Barry James, president and portfolio manager of James Advantage Funds. "The explorers have been left behind a little bit by the refiners, and now's their time to catch up."
On the losing end were raw-material producers, which tumbled 3.4 percent for the sharpest loss among the 11 sectors that make up the S&P 500.
PPG, which sells paints and coatings, sank 10.1 percent to $98.56 for the biggest loss in the S&P 500 after it warned that higher costs for oil and other materials will weigh on its third-quarter results. It also said that demand is weakening in China, as well as in the United States and Europe for automotive refinish products.
Companies across the economy are scheduled to report their earnings results for the summer in the coming weeks, and expectations along Wall Street are for another strong quarter of growth. Lower taxes and a strong U.S. economy are helping profits, but investors also want to hear what companies say about their costs and how the global trade war is affecting their business.
The International Monetary Fund downgraded its forecast for global economic growth late Monday, citing higher interest rates and ongoing trade battles. The IMF said the global economy will grow 3.7 percent this year, the same as in 2017, but down from its earlier forecast of 3.9 percent. The IMF also cut its forecast for Chinese economic growth in 2019 to 6.2 percent, which would be its slowest since 1990.
In markets abroad, Japan's Nikkei 225 fell 1.3 percent, Hong Kong's Hang Seng fell 0.1 percent and the Shanghai Composite index rose 0.2 percent. In Europe, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.3 percent, and the German DAX gained 0.3 percent. The FTSE 100 in London edged up 0.1 percent.
In the commodities markets, benchmark U.S. crude rose 0.9 percent to $74.94 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, rose 1.3 percent to $85 a barrel.
Gold rose 0.2 percent to settle at $1,191.50 per ounce, silver gained 0.5 percent to $14.40 per ounce and copper rose 1.4 percent to $2.81 per pound.
The dollar rose to 113.05 Japanese yen from 112.98 yen late Monday. The euro rose to $1.1496 from $1.1488, and the British pound rose to $1.3146 from $1.3090.

Full text: TORNIO, Finland -- You must have a very good reason to toil in iron-melting heat an hour's drive south of the Arctic Circle. But there is an economic logic behind the Finnish steel maker Outokumpu's huge complex in this small city, where reindeer fillets are regular fare. Its centralized production line of high-grade stainless helps to explain how global supply chains work -- and why President Trump's trade war could be disruptive.
Outokumpu's story is one of finding comparative advantage and efficiencies. And it begins hundreds of meters beneath a Lapland forest inside a man-made warren of industry. On a recent day, a miner, Kalle Kilpelanaho, was perched in the cab of a large boring machine deep inside a tunnel, twisting a joystick that could maneuver a drill 20 meters into the rock floor.
"We want the dark brown," Mr. Kilpelanaho shouted over a mechanical roar, referring to the pulverized rock churned up by the drill. Brown indicates chromium ore, the element that turns ordinary steel into rust-resistant stainless steel. It shines the drums that spin inside American washing machines or beats back rust in cars.
Outokumpu has a bounty of it.
The discovery of copper in eastern Finland a century ago and then chromium here in the 1950s -- an estimated 100 million tons underground as of 2012 -- made Outokumpu an economic engine for Finland.
Generations of families have worked in its factories and lived off its chromium deposits as the demand for high-grade stainless has increased globally. The government owns a 26 percent stake. Today, there are 2,300 workers, separated by just a few miles, involved in mining or smelting or trucking miles-long rolls of finished steel to a nearby company-owned seaport in the Gulf of Bothnia.
The steel is shipped through the Baltic Sea and then across the Atlantic to American manufacturers, who have been among the Finnish company's eager customers.
But the economic rationale behind global supply chains has been scrambled by Mr. Trump's tariffs. By imposing a 25 percent tax on steel imports from the European Union and other allies, Mr. Trump has forced customers of companies like Outokumpu to obey a logic defined by his policies rather than market forces.
The president's aim is to raise the price of imported steel and force companies to buy steel from companies in the United States. There are some complications -- and contradictions -- for buyers. Modern steel is a designer product. Depending on what a customer wants, steel makers mix in ingredients like nickel, molybdenum or titanium to create differing degrees of hardness, pliability or resistance to corrosion.
Many kinds of steel, including varieties made in Tornio, are simply not available from suppliers in the United States. And no one is much interested in making them in America because the demand is too small to justify the investment. Outokumpu has mills in small cities in Alabama and South Carolina as well as Mexico, but no site produces stainless as efficiently as the Finnish plant can.
Perhaps most important, there are no active chromium mines in North America.
The president's tariffs on imported steel have created headaches for people like Chris Ulbrich, chief executive of Ulbrich Stainless Steels & Special Metals in North Haven, Conn.
The family firm buys steel from Outokumpu and processes it further for use in products like aircraft engines and automobile airbags.
One of the varieties of steel that Ulbrich buys from Outokumpu is called Type 305 Stainless and contains at least 12.4 percent nickel. The recipe is tailor-made for a customer whom Mr. Ulbrich, for proprietary and competitive reasons, declined to name.
Mr. Ulbrich, the third generation of the family that founded the company, said he had searched for the same product among the handful of American companies that still make stainless steel. He finally found one willing to produce the steel. But the supplier insisted that Mr. Ulbrich buy many times more of it than he needed.
"We do 160 grades of metal here, they are all different," Mr. Ulbrich said. "This 305 item has a special chemistry and is not made in the U.S."
Mr. Ulbrich said he had little choice but to pass the tariffs on to his customers. Eventually consumers will wind up paying the tab. "Inflation will start to pick up," he said.
Why should some kinds of steel come only from northern Finland, where it is so cold in winter that the sea freezes and icebreakers must clear a path to the harbor? Despite its location, as close to Russia's arctic port of Murmansk as to Helsinki, Tornio offers a favorable combination of conditions.
Outokumpu's landscape -- the proximity of mines, factory and seaport -- saves time in production and on transport that allows for "an enormous efficiency gain," said Roeland Baan, the company's chief executive.
The most important factor is the chromium wealth beneath Kemi, a town about 15 miles from Tornio. An amateur geologist discovered the chromium deposit in the 1950s when he noticed a rock embedded with telltale silvery flecks.
At the beginning the ore was dug from an open pit, and when the shovels couldn't go any deeper Outokumpu began tunneling underground. Today a grid of tunnels reaches down 500 meters, or about one-third of a mile.
The mine is its own underground world, with a lecture hall for training sessions and a subterranean employee cafeteria, where the main course on a recent day was liver stew.
A cavern blasted from the rock serves as a maintenance garage for a fleet of vehicles, ranging from pickups to haulers that pump concrete reinforcing for tunnel walls. There is even a small boat used for crossing flooded areas. The brightly lit space is big enough that, to mark extraction of the 50 millionth ton of ore in February, Outokumpu had a party there and hired a Finnish heavy metal band for entertainment. Cue the jokes about "hard rock."
An underground road, five miles long and wide enough for two trucks to pass, connects to dozens of side tunnels where the ore is dug. In the chill air at the end of one tunnel, a worker wired explosives embedded in the rock face. He was preparing to blast out a section of ore, which would then be dug out, crushed and hauled up a central shaft to the surface.
It is only a short drive from the mines to the huge furnaces in Tornio, where the ore is melted with other ingredients to create ferrochrome, a crucial ingredient in stainless steel.
The ferrochrome, still molten, travels on rails a few hundred meters across the factory complex to be mixed with additional chemicals and minerals to make stainless steel. The short distance between mine, smelter and steel furnace eliminates the need to reheat the ferrochrome and adds to the cost savings.
The Outokumpu factory also provides a lesson on why some kinds of steel are impossible to buy in the United States. Every batch of steel has its own recipe, concocted for specific customers. There are some recipes for the steel sold to the German high-end appliance maker Miele for drums that rotate inside washing machines and others for the blades of Swiss Army knives made by Victorinox. Outokumpu supplied textured stainless for a building in the new World Trade Center in Manhattan.
"It's like baking cookies, but on a different scale," said Niklas Wass, who oversees the Tornio works. "You need to specialize in certain things." Mr. Wass stood on a scaffold overlooking a furnace and watched a worker, strapped with a remote control apparatus, prepare a ladle of molten ore. "You only have so many melts. You need a certain volume to be economical."
The process was mesmerizing. The worker positioned a ladle full of white-hot liquid ferrochrome in front of a huge oven. A door slid open to reveal a mixing vat glowing red from intense heat. The worker tipped the ladle, which was hanging from pulleys, so that the ferrochrome poured into the vat. The stream of liquid shone so brightly that a visitor was advised to watch only through tinted film, as if it were a solar eclipse.
Once mixed, the steel cools for days before it is flattened into half-mile long strips. The steel is later rolled and hoisted into ships at a port, which Outokumpu operates, within a 10-minute drive from the factory.
Mr. Wass and other Outokumpu executives were guarded about what effect the tariffs might be having on the Tornio operations. Toni Keranen, a labor representative, said so far there had been no major effects.
But there is an undercurrent of apprehension among workers, he said.
"They are aware of the tariffs and they are following the situation, and they are talking about it," Mr. Keranen said.
Any disruptions could be dire for Tornio. It is not unusual for three generations of a family to work at the factory, Mr. Keranen said. "Right now, Outokumpu feels like a safe employer. If there was no Outokumpu, there would be nothing."

Winner of Nobel in economics to be announced.
At least one prominent economist will enter the pantheon of Nobel laureates on Monday, when the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announces the winner of the 2018 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science. In recent years, the Nobel committee has tended to honor economists who focus on the mechanics of individual behavior, rather than the authors of grand macroeconomic theories. Last year's winner was the behavioral economist Richard Thaler, who was recognized for his work demonstrating that people are predictably irrational -- that human behavior defies economic theory in ways that are both consistent and foreseeable.

TECHNOLOGY
Google plans to unveil new products.
Google continues its uphill battle in the consumer hardware business. The company on Tuesday is expected to unveil an array of products, including its third-generation Pixel smartphones, at an event in New York. Though the Pixel phones have received glowing reviews, they are still small sellers compared with Apple iPhones and Samsung devices.

ECONOMY
Modest rise expected in consumer prices in September.
On Thursday, at 8:30 a.m., the Labor Department will announce its reading of the Consumer Price Index for September. Inflation has been tame lately, despite a strong economy, and the C.P.I. is expected to reflect that. The overall index and the core components are both expected to rise 0.2 percent. On the other hand, a stronger-than-expected figure could unnerve investors already concerned about rising interest rates.

ECONOMY
Trade on agenda at I.M.F.-World Bank meetings.
The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund gather for their annual meetings this week on the Indonesian island of Bali. The gatherings come as politicians in countries like the United States have rebuked multilateralism and openly questioned the value of international institutions like the World Bank and I.M.F. Officials gathered in Bali will probably address the rising tensions between the United States and China. Christine Lagarde, the head of the I.M.F., is expected to address how trade can be an engine of growth for all nations. Also on the agenda: how the global economy is at risk of another economic crisis, something that the I.M.F. warned about in its recent Global Financial Stability Report.

BANKING
Major banks will report third-quarter earnings.
Bank earnings season begins this week with the first three megabanks revealing their third-quarter results on Friday. Reports are due from JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup before the stock market opens. Investors will be looking at their loan growth, which could be stronger than it was in last year's third quarter thanks to a better overall economy. Their trading businesses may have suffered again.

Full text: President Trump has put trade policy at the center of his agenda. A case in point is the revised trade agreement with Mexico and Canada, announced on Monday. Yet it is hard to be sanguine about this accomplishment, in part because the changes are so modest but mostly because the president's overall approach to international trade is so confused. Mr. Trump's confusion is understandable. Economists have spent centuries studying trade, debunking common myths and arriving at some surprising truths.
Let's review, both for the president and ourselves, some conclusions about trade that most economists accept but, upon first hearing, are not at all obvious.
Bilateral trade deficits don't matter.
When Mr. Trump discusses our trade relations with another nation, he often points to the bilateral trade balance -- the difference between the value of our exports to that nation and the value of our imports from it. If imports exceed exports, we are running a bilateral trade deficit, which Mr. Trump interprets as a sign that we are the relationship's losers.
To understand what's wrong with that inference, consider some of the many bilateral trade deficits that I run. Whenever my family goes out to dinner, the restaurateur gets some money, and we get a meal. In economics parlance, the Mankiw family runs a trade deficit with that restaurant. But that doesn't make us losers. After all, we leave with full stomachs.
To be sure, I would be happy to have balanced trade. I would be delighted if every time my family went out to dinner, the restaurateur bought one of my books. But it would be harebrained for me to expect that or to boycott restaurants that had no interest in adding to their collection of economics textbooks.
I can run persistent trade deficits with restaurants because I run trade surpluses elsewhere. Take The New York Times, for instance. It pays me more for my columns than I pay it for my subscription. That's a bilateral trade surplus for me and a bilateral trade deficit for The Times. But nonetheless, we both gain from the relationship.
The overall trade deficit matters but not for what it says about trade.
If we add up all the bilateral trade balances with other countries, we get the nation's overall trade balance -- the difference between the value of all United States exports and imports. For many years, the United States trade balance has been negative, meaning that total imports have exceeded total exports. Mr. Trump believes this trade deficit is a sign that other nations have been taking advantage of us.
To see the folly in that conclusion, consider again the Mankiw family. Our overall trade balance is the sum of all our bilateral trade balances with everyone else -- restaurants, The Times, and so on. The end result equals the difference between our income and our spending.
If our overall trade balance is positive, we are spending less than we are earning, meaning we are saving. If our overall trade balance is negative, we are spending more than we are earning. In the language of economists, we are dissaving.
Whether a trade deficit represents a problem depends on whether our spending is prudent or profligate. When a family takes out a loan to buy a car, it runs a trade deficit, but that need not be a reason for concern, as long as it can afford the car in the long run.
On the other hand, if a family runs a trade deficit by persistently living beyond its means, that's a problem because debts eventually come due. But in this case, the trouble comes not from disreputable trading partners but from poor financial planning. If you eat at expensive restaurants too often, blame yourself, not the restaurateur.
Similar reasoning applies to countries. Nations run trade deficits when their spending on consumption and investment, both private and public, exceeds the value of goods and services they produce. If you really want to reduce a trade deficit, the way to do it is to bring down spending relative to production, not to demonize trading partners around the world.
Many of the president's policies will increase the trade deficit.
Mr. Trump thinks the trade deficit makes us losers in international trade, so he wants to shrink it. But many of his initiatives actually push in the opposite direction.
The tax cuts, for example, tend to increase private spending, by both households on consumption goods and businesses on investment goods. Reduced business regulation should also stimulate investment spending. Because the trade deficit represents an excess of spending over production, this increased spending results in a larger trade deficit.
Movements in the exchange rate help explain the link between spending and the trade deficit. As spending in the United States increases, the Federal Reserve will need to raise interest rates to keep inflation in check. Higher interest rates attract capital inflows from abroad, causing the dollar to appreciate. A stronger dollar makes our exports more expensive and our imports cheaper.
All this isn't to say that the president's policies are necessarily misguided. The tax bill should be interpreted on its own merits -- whether it makes the tax system fairer and more efficient and whether it brings in enough revenue to finance the government. And each regulatory change should be evaluated based on its costs and benefits.
What these policies do to the trade deficit is, at most, a secondary concern. In many ways, the trade deficit is a fake problem. Our elected leaders should look elsewhere to gauge the success of their policies.
N. GREGORY MANKIW N. Gregory Mankiw is the Robert M. Beren professor of economics at Harvard University. You can run a trade deficit with him by buying his book Principles of Economics.

Jobless Rate Sinks Again, The Lowest In 50 Years

Full text: The unemployment rate fell to a nearly five-decade low in September, punctuating a remarkable rebound in the 10 years since the collapse of Lehman Brothers set off a global financial crisis. By almost any measure, the American economy is humming. Gross domestic product is on pace for its best year since the housing bubble of the mid-2000s. Consumers and businesses are the most confident they have been in years, if not decades. Stock market indexes are near record highs.
The latest milestone came in a Friday report from the Labor Department: The unemployment rate fell to 3.7 percent last month, the lowest since December 1969, when hundreds of thousands of working-age Americans were serving in Vietnam.
"I view this as the strongest labor market in a generation," said Andrew Chamberlain, chief economist at the career site Glassdoor. "These really are the good times."
The turnaround from a decade ago is hard to overstate. In September 2008, American employers cut 443,000 jobs as the financial system collapsed around them. More than seven million more jobs evaporated in the months that followed. Even when the hemorrhaging stopped, shellshocked executives were slow to bring back laid-off workers, sparking fears of a "jobless recovery."
But when the hiring engine finally kicked back into gear, it did so in historic fashion. The 134,000 jobs added in September made it the 96th consecutive month of growth -- eight full years, double the previous record. Employers have added close to 20 million jobs during that streak. (September's growth, a modest slowdown from August, would probably have been stronger absent the effects of Hurricane Florence, which struck the Carolinas in the middle of the month.)
Crucially, the recovery is reaching groups that struggled in the early years of the recovery. The unemployment rates for African-Americans and Hispanics are both near all-time lows. Teenagers, less-educated workers and disabled Americans have also made progress in recent months. And anecdotal reports suggest that companies are becoming more willing to hire people with criminal records or to waive drug-testing requirements.
Republicans are hoping the strong economy will help them hold off a potential "blue wave" of Democratic victories in next month's midterm elections. Friday's report was one of the last before Election Day, and President Trump wasted no time before cheering the news on Twitter.
It isn't clear, however, that economic data will have much effect at the polls. Surveys show that views of the economy are split along partisan lines, with Democrats and even many independents expressing less optimism than Republicans.
Indeed, the decade-long economic rebound from the financial crisis has been impressive more for its durability than for its strength. Millions of Americans remain stuck in part-time or temporary work, and many of the middle-class jobs wiped out by the recession have never returned. As a share of the population, employment remains well below its 2000 peak, a gap only partly explained by the aging population.
Most significant, strong hiring has not yet translated into robust raises for many workers. Average hourly earnings rose 2.8 percent in September from a year earlier, down from 2.9 percent in August and well below the growth that economists would usually expect with the unemployment rate this low.
But there are signs that wage growth could at long last be gaining momentum. Before last month's hiccup, the pace of growth had been drifting upward. Industries where labor is especially tight, such as construction and technology, are seeing wages rise faster.
Workers at the bottom of the earnings ladder, who were left behind early in the recovery, are now seeing particularly strong growth: Amazon announced this week that it would raise the minimum wage for its employees in the United States to $15 an hour.
Amy Glaser, a senior vice president at the staffing firm Adecco, heard the Amazon news on television while preparing for a meeting with a rival e-commerce firm. Ms. Glaser helps companies hire for the holiday season, a task that Amazon had just made even more difficult for them.
"There was definitely a feeling of concern," she said. "It puts increased pressure on them in a market where they already knew they were going to have to make significant adjustments on wages."
Higher pay alone may not be enough. The combination of a tight labor market and rapidly growing online sales has made the competition for warehouse workers particularly fierce this year. Ms. Glaser said companies were hiring earlier, easing job requirements and giving workers more control over their schedules, a big shift in an industry that has traditionally expected workers to show up when and where they are needed.
"The demand for workers is higher than ever, and the supply just isn't out there right now," Ms. Glaser said.
Christine Specht is dealing with just that challenge. Ms. Specht runs Cousins Subs, a Wisconsin sandwich chain that is struggling to find workers as it looks to expand into the Chicago area.
Cousins has raised wages in recent years but still pays well under the $15 an hour that Amazon and other big companies are promising. As the operator of a small chain in a competitive industry, Ms. Specht said, she is reluctant to raise prices in order to pay employees more.
"We can't always run to the menu board every time there's a cost increase in running our business," Ms. Specht said. "That's kind of a last resort."
Instead, the company is looking for other ways to attract workers. Cousins has ramped up its training program to help workers advance into management, offered referral bonuses to employees who help recruit their friends and staged "hiring blitz days," when executives set up shop in a restaurant and interview candidates on the spot. More than anything, they are trying to move quickly.
"You can't sit on applications anymore, because people have options and they will go somewhere else," Ms. Specht said.
Many economists think the shortage of workers will cause job growth to slow in the months ahead. But others argue that there is still room for the labor pool to expand, as employers become willing to consider candidates they would have overlooked earlier and as higher wages attract people who had been choosing not to work.
"You did see something like that in the late '90s, which is probably the closest analogue," said Jeremy Schwartz, an economist for Credit Suisse in New York. "In a sufficiently strong labor market, you really were pulling people from the sidelines."
It is unclear whether that can happen again. In the 1990s, baby boomers were in their prime working years; today, they are retiring at a rate of 10,000 a day. The number of people being hired from outside the labor force is near an all-time high. Yet the participation rate -- the share of adults working or actively looking for work -- has been essentially flat in recent years.
"You do see prime-working-age individuals coming back into the labor force," said Michelle Meyer, head of United States economics for Bank of America Merrill Lynch. "But the demographic forces are so fierce that it provides a complete offset."
Policymakers at the Federal Reserve are watching warily for signs that the shrinking pool of labor is leading the economy to overheat, as competition for workers drives up wages and, ultimately, inflation. That could force the Fed to raise interest rates more quickly than planned, which could cause a recession.
Yields on United States government bonds have risen sharply in recent days, a sign that investors expect inflation -- and interest rates -- to rise in coming years. Those concerns have also filtered through to the stock market, where major indexes fell again on Friday after dropping on Thursday.
But in a speech in Boston earlier this week, Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chairman, said he didn't see the tight labor market translating into faster inflation. Friday's report, which showed the unemployment rate falling without wage growth accelerating, is unlikely to change that view, Ms. Meyer said.
With the economy in such strong shape, attention on Wall Street has turned to what could bring the good times to an end. Fed rate increases are one popular answer. A trade war is another.
Economists and business leaders have warned for months that Mr. Trump's tariffs could threaten the recovery, particularly in manufacturing. There is little sign of that so far, however. That sector added 18,000 jobs in September, and the revised figures erased what was initially reported as a small decline in August. Other measures of the industrial sector likewise show continued growth.
"We really don't have any negative impact from the tariffs yet," said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist for the consulting firm RSM.

Full text: The bond market dominated the conversation on Wall Street this week as yields on benchmark Treasury bonds, which help determine interest rates for borrowers ranging from first-time home buyers to international corporations, steadily rose to seven-year highs. The increase is something of a double-edged sword. On the one hand, a rise in yields reflects the strength of the economy. At the end of Friday, after a report showed unemployment is at its lowest since 1969, the yield on the 10-year note -- or what the United States government will pay to borrow money for a decade -- was 3.23 percent. It hadn't been that high since May 2011.
But as rates rise, borrowing will also become more expensive for consumers and companies, potentially slowing growth. Higher rates also change the balance of risk and reward for investors in other markets. Reflecting this, stocks fell, with the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index ending the week down more than 1 percent.
The idea that growth will push interest rates higher, only for higher rates to slow things down again, reflects the cyclical nature of the economy. Right now, rates are somewhere in between -- not high enough to hurt growth, but rising and making some investors wary as they do. Here's what to make of it all.
The economy
Bond investors are betting on expansion
Government bonds are known as safe haven investments. People buy them, instead of riskier investments like stocks, corporate debt and commodities, because they're worried about something: the economy, war, politics, you name it.
Bond yields move in the opposite direction of prices, so yields fall during such rough patches.
Since the financial crisis hit a decade ago, yields have been pretty low. The yield on the 10-year note has spent much of the past decade below 3 percent. (The low point was under 1.4 percent in July 2016.)
Those yields prevailed even as the American economy recovered. That's partly because the Federal Reserve took extraordinary steps to try to nurse the economy back to health. But it also reflected lingering doubts among investors about the expansion. Even recently, plenty of investors have doubted whether the economy could grow as a trade war erupted.
But grow it has, with gross domestic product expanding at an annual rate of 4.2 percent in the second quarter, and even some glass-half-empty types are becoming convinced that a recession isn't in the cards any time soon. So yields are rising.
"Big picture, the economy is very strong," said Tim High, an interest rate strategist at BNP Paribas in New York. "The employment market remains very strong."
In fact, the worry has now switched to whether that growth will start to run too hot, leading to faster inflation and pushing the Fed to raise interest rates faster than it would like.
For now, High said, that isn't something to worry about -- which means investors should be spared any nasty economic surprises.
The Future
But everything will get more expensive
In the United States, we rely on a lot of debt to fuel the economy. And when the cost of that debt rises, it can drag on growth.
We're about to find out how heavy that weight will be.
As we've said, for much of the last decade, long-term interest rates -- which are essentially set by the Treasury market -- have been quite low. Now rising rates are pulling other key borrowing costs higher.
Rates on conventional 30-year fixed-rate mortgages are above 4.7 percent, the highest level since 2011. Likewise, interest rates on 48-month new car loans have risen to more than 5 percent. They hadn't been that high since 2012, according to the most recent data from the Fed.
Traditionally, cars and houses play a big role in the consumption-driven American economy. And if there's a weak spot in the otherwise strong economy, it could be in these interest-sensitive sectors.
Sales of existing homes have slipped in recent months. They were flat in August, and are down 1.5 percent from the previous year.
Automakers have reported steep declines in sales in September. Part of that decline reflected hurricanes that caused flooding in the Carolinas. But higher interest rates and rising car prices are also pushing some buyers toward the used car market.
The Stock Market
And stocks will start to look less attractive
We often talk about financial markets -- stocks, corporate debt, government bonds, commodities -- as if they existed in complete isolation from one another.
They don't.
Changes in one can often have large effects on another. If oil prices fall, for example, that's obviously going to pinch the earnings of the companies that pump oil and refine gasoline. That will affect the stock prices of those companies, and the stock market as a whole.
Likewise, higher yields on government bonds can have a subtle, but important, impact on the stock market. As rates move higher, they can persuade more and more people who've ridden the nearly decade-long bull market in stocks to take some of their winnings off the table and sock them away in government bonds.
Eventually, that could start to take the wind out of the stock market's sails.

Full text: Saving has a simple, almost magical, power. The sooner you start, the more your money grows, and the easier it gets to maintain the habit. You may not be earning much right out of college, but time is on your side. That's important. Putting aside even small amounts regularly now could make the difference between living comfortably as you get older or constantly worrying over your finances. "Remember that being frugal isn't about being cheap or depriving yourself," Stefanie O'Connell, the author of "The Broke and Beautiful Life," said in an interview.
If learning how to save money sounds like it's going to require some mental gymnastics, well, that's no surprise. But there are tactics to help get you on your way.
50-30-20: A formula to build on
Before she was a United States senator, Elizabeth Warren popularized the idea of 50-30-20 budgeting. Here's the concept, laid out in a book she wrote with her daughter, Amelia Warren Tyagi, "All Your Worth: The Ultimate Lifetime Money Plan":
50 percent of your income after taxes goes to basic expenses (rent, utilities, groceries).
30 percent is for discretionary spending (vacations, a big night out).
20 percent is for saving or paying off debt.
This is a guideline. Depending on where you live, how much you earn and what your expenses are, putting 20 percent toward savings may be unrealistic. Maybe you can save more. If you need to adjust to fit your circumstances, that's O.K. The point is, if there's a logic to your spending, it will feel good, not like a burden.
As important as saving is, it's unrealistic to expect you'll never splurge. Even the 50-30-20 rules allows you to spend something on whatever you want. What's important is figuring out what that is.
Make a list of everything you enjoy spending money on. The things at the top of the list -- books, say, or travel or dining out -- are where you should focus discretionary spending.
Pay yourself first
If you put something aside as soon as you're paid -- commit to the 20 before the 30 -- you don't have it to spend. Personal finance experts call this paying yourself first. Need motivation? Establish a concrete purpose for your savings, whether short term (a trip to Japan) or more distant (a comfortable retirement).
One good way to enforce savings: Enroll in your employer's 401(k) plan, if there is one. A percentage of your pay comes out of every check, before taxes. Some employers offer a 401(k) match: For every dollar you put in, they equal it up to a certain ceiling. This is free money. Get as much as you can.
Another way to pay yourself first is to create an automatic online transfer so that a portion of each paycheck goes to a savings account. It's a standard option with most banks. To set it up, just use the "transfer" tab on your bank's website, call customer service or stop in at a branch.
Let your money make you more money
When the interest you earn on your savings also earns interest, that's compound interest. The more often it happens, the more your savings will grow.
Of course, your gains in a savings account will be minuscule -- you'll be lucky to get 1 percent compounded annually -- so the concept works most powerfully with an investment account like a 401(k).
Here's an example:
If a 22-year-old and a 32-year-old each put away the same amount of money every year ($5,000) and earn the same return on their investments (6 percent annually), by the time they hit 67, one will end up with nearly twice as much money as the other. Without doing anything else.
The 32-year-old will have saved about $557,000.
The 22-year-old will have saved more than $1.06 million.
Remember, investing is more complicated and riskier than simply putting money into a savings account. But if you invest sensibly, accept that the stock market rises and falls and stick to long-term goals, your investments will multiply over time.
Be a shrewd customer
Meeting your goals involves being smarter about spending, and not just by clipping coupons.
"I'm all about frugal strategies that take little time and maximize savings," said Kyle James, founder of the deal site Rather-Be-Shopping.com.
For example: Cable and internet providers typically increase users' monthly bills after an initial promotional period. When they do, try calling and seeking a better rate with this simple script: "I noticed you recently increased my rate. I've been a loyal customer. Can you offer a better deal?"
The immediate answer will often be no, but if you politely threaten to switch providers, there is a decent chance you'll be transferred to a different department, where you may get a better offer. And if you get your bill lowered, that's a year of savings from one (hopefully) brief call.
When you shop online, the Honey browser extension automatically searches for coupon codes, applying the codes that yield the biggest savings at checkout. Websites like Camelcamelcamel track price fluctuations at Amazon and other shopping sites. You can also get email notifications when an item you want falls below a certain price.
Daily deal sites and clearance racks invite impulse spending. Watch out for them. Another good rule to follow: Saving money doesn't always mean choosing the cheapest option. A more expensive shirt that lasts a long time may be a much better value than four cheaper shirts.
Avoid the 'lifestyle inflation' trap
Ideally, as your career unfolds, you'll get promotions, raises and bonuses. When you do, you'll be tempted to spend whatever added money you get on more expensive clothes, a costly vacation or other nonessentials. Don't do it.
Instead, when you do get a raise, apply the same savings rules to it and put a portion aside. It's O.K. to spend some of that newfound money on something that has been out of reach. But if you can maintain your current lifestyle on a larger income, you'll be able to save that much more. Remember: You're saving now to live comfortably later on. Succumbing to "lifestyle inflation" won't help you there.

Full text: Global stocks fell Thursday as interest rates in the United States continued to rise. Technology and internet companies skidded and the Nasdaq composite took its biggest loss in three months. Strong reports on job gains and the service industry have sent bond prices tumbling over the last two days as traders bet the United States economy will keep growing at about its current clip.
But the big drop in bond prices is sending interest rates sharply higher, a development that worries investors because it can eventually slow economic growth by making borrowing more expensive for consumers and businesses. It also makes bonds a more intriguing investment compared to stocks.
Sameer Samana, strategist for the Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said that after months of positive economic data, traders in the bond market are selling because they have decided yields are too low for them to get a good return on their investments.
"Economic data for months has been strengthening," he said. "The bond market has completely ignored it until recently."
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index skidded 23.90 points, or 0.8 percent, to 2,901.61. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 200.91 points, or 0.7 percent, to 26,627.48. The Nasdaq composite fell 145.57 points, or 1.8 percent, to 7,879.51.
Bond prices fell again. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note climbed to 3.19 percent from 3.18 percent. Yields began climbing Wednesday following encouraging signs on hiring by private companies and growth for services companies.
That data suggests the economy should keep growing at a solid pace. That translates to bigger profits for American companies and continued increases in interest rates by the Federal Reserve, as it tries to check inflation. But after an early rally on Wednesday, investors have been considering the negative aspects of that increase in yields.
The health of the economy and the pace of inflation will both be in focus Friday morning after the Labor Department makes its monthly jobs report. That will include hiring by governments and private companies in September and will also include data on wage increases.
Alphabet, Google's parent company, fell 2.8 percent to $1,177.07. That was its worst loss in five months. Apple slid 1.8 percent to $227.99 and Microsoft lost 2.1 percent to $112.79. Facebook shed 2.2 percent to $158.85 and Amazon declined 2.2 percent to $1,909.42.
Industrial and energy companies have both lagged the broader S.&P. 500 in 2018. Those stocks fell Thursday, but they did better than the rest of the market.
The same pattern played out in Europe as stocks and bond prices fell.
Hopes of deals also boosted shares of some companies. Barnes & Noble climbed 21.8 percent to $6.65 after the bookseller said it will review offers from potential buyers, including one from founder and chairman Leonard Riggio, the company's biggest shareholder. Even after Thursday's gain, Barnes & Noble stock is slightly lower in 2018 and has lost almost two-thirds of its value since July 2015.
Benchmark United States crude slid 2.7 percent to $74.33 per barrel in New York. It hit four-year highs this week.
Gold fell $1.10 to $1,197.20 an ounce.
The dollar fell to 113.86 yen from 114.34. The euro slipped to $1.1513 from $1.1514.

Fed Chief Says Economy Is 'Not Too Good to Be True'

Full text: BOSTON -- Jerome H. Powell, the Federal Reserve chairman, said Tuesday that the American economy is enjoying an unusual but sustainable period of low unemployment and low inflation. He described the current moment, and the Fed's expectation that it will continue, as "not too good to be true." Inflation is hovering around the 2 percent annual pace that the central bank regards as optimal while the unemployment rate has remained close to 4 percent for the last year. Economists have long regarded low unemployment as a harbinger of higher inflation, and there is no precedent in modern American history for both economic indicators to remain at such low levels.
But Mr. Powell said there was reason to believe this time could be different.
He said the Fed's success in holding down inflation in recent decades has reinforced public expectations that inflation would stay low, and that, in turn, is helping to keep inflation low.
"These developments amount to a better world for households and businesses, which no longer experience or even fear the scourge of high and volatile inflation," Mr. Powell said on Tuesday in Boston at the annual meeting of the National Association for Business Economics.
Mr. Powell, speaking a few hours after Amazon announced it would raise its entry-level wage to $15 an hour, said evidence of increased wage growth is "quite welcome."
The Fed chairman's remarks are likely to resonate with Trump administration officials, who insist that faster economic growth is sustainable. "I'm in favor of higher wages," Larry Kudlow, the president's chief economic adviser, told reporters on Tuesday after Amazon's announcement. "More people working and prospering -- you've heard me say this before -- is not inflationary. It's a good thing, not a bad thing."
Fed officials have long assumed inflation and unemployment sit on opposite ends of a seesaw: As unemployment falls, inflation tends to rise; as unemployment rises, inflation tends to fall.
That model, known as the Phillips curve, accurately described the relationship between inflation and unemployment in the middle of the 20th century. But the volatility of inflation has diminished in recent decades. As unemployment has swelled and subsided, inflation has remained low and steady.
Mr. Powell said Tuesday that the relationship has been weakened by the Fed's success in controlling inflation, which has instilled confidence that the Fed will continue to control inflation. As a result, even when unemployment falls, investors are not as quick to build higher inflation expectations into asset prices.
"Many factors, including better conduct of monetary policy over the past few decades, have greatly reduced but not eliminated the effects that tight labor markets have on inflation," Mr. Powell said.
Mr. Powell's view suggests that inflation is unlikely to rise quickly even as the labor market continues to tighten. Between August 2017 and August 2018, the most recent available data, average hourly wages increased by 2.9 percent, although, adjusting for inflation, the increase was just 0.2 percent, federal data shows. The government will release September wage data on Friday.
While the Fed sees little slack in the economy, Mr. Powell said he did not see wage growth as an indication that the economy was beginning to overheat since wages were rising in line with inflation and productivity. Even if wage growth began to outpace inflation and productivity, Mr. Powell said it still might not foretell faster inflation, pointing to the example of the 1990s.
"The key is anchored expectations" for stable inflation, Mr. Powell said.
He added, however, that the Fed would remain watchful. "Common sense suggests we should beware when forecasts predict events seldom before observed in the economy," he said.
The Fed is raising interest rates slowly and steadily, which Mr. Powell described as a form of risk management. The Fed raised its benchmark interest rate in September for the third time this year, into a range between 2 and 2.25 percent. Another quarter-point increase is expected in December.
Mr. Powell said that the Fed was raising rates because it might be wrong about the dangers of inflation, but that it was moving slowly because it did not want to impede or end economic growth.
"Our ongoing policy of gradual interest rate normalization reflects our efforts to balance the inevitable risks that come with extraordinary times, so as to extend the current expansion, while maintaining maximum employment and low and stable inflation," Mr. Powell said.
During a question-and-answer session, Mr. Powell was asked about the economic effects of the Trump administration's tax cuts and trade policies. He said that the tax cuts had provided a short-term boost to growth, but that it was too early to tell whether the cuts would encourage investment that might increase growth in the longer term. On trade restrictions, he said that the Fed did not yet see evidence of any broad economic effect, but that it was probably too early to judge the effects.
Mr. Powell said the Fed also was paying attention to the economic performance of the rest of the world. The recovery in other developed nations has lagged behind that of the United States, but Mr. Powell said the overall picture remained "reasonably positive."
"I think growth is still healthy, but maybe under a little pressure," he said.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- President Trump said Monday that the revised North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada would pour "cash and jobs" into the United States. But the deal's importance may have less to do with the details than the signal it sends that Mr. Trump is methodically settling his multifront trade war to fight a single enemy: China. A jubilant Mr. Trump celebrated the new Nafta agreement as the fulfillment of a bedrock campaign promise. He claimed it was a vindication of his aggressive use of tariffs and vowed to keep imposing them to extract deals from other trading partners, like the European Union and Japan.
But while Mr. Trump expressed confidence about eventually reaching deals with Europe and Japan, he was far more grudging about China, saying it was too soon to begin talking. Administration officials say privately that Mr. Trump is content to leave tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods in place for the foreseeable future to weaken its hand.
"China wants to talk very badly," Mr. Trump said at a news conference in the White House Rose Garden. "I said frankly it's too early to talk, because they're not ready." He added, "If politically, people force it too quickly, you're not going to make the right deal."
The updated Nafta, which will be called the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or U.S.M.C.A., represents Mr. Trump's biggest trade achievement to date, and it comes after more than a year of intense negotiations that frequently fell into personal rancor between Mr. Trump and the leaders of Canada and Mexico.
After languishing for weeks, negotiations with Canada suddenly broke through Friday morning, according to a senior American official. The Trump administration, having received a detailed proposal from Canadian officials the day before, submitted a counteroffer, which the Canadians accepted in principle.
With a deal safely in hand, Mr. Trump lavished praise on Mexico's outgoing president, Enrique Peña Nieto, with whom he had tangled repeatedly over the phone. He was less effusive about Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, but suggested their Cold War was over, too. It was not personal, Mr. Trump suggested about both men; it was just business.
"We had very strong tensions," Mr. Trump said. "It was just an unfair deal, whether it was Mexico or Canada, and now it's a fair deal for everybody. It's a much different deal. It's a brand-new deal. It's not Nafta redone."
Still, like some of Mr. Trump's other accomplishments in business and government, the deal is partly a step forward and partly an exercise in rebranding.
Canada will ease longstanding protections on its dairy market and provide access greater than what the United States would have gained through the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade treaty negotiated by President Barack Obama, from which Mr. Trump withdrew last year.
The United States relented on its demand to eliminate an independent tariff dispute settlement system that Canada had said was a red line. Preserving it was a major concession for the United States, which had eliminated the mechanism, known as Chapter 19, as part of its deal with Mexico.
The pact also makes a series of changes to areas like intellectual property and the digital economy, including protections for patents and domain names -- all of which refresh Nafta, a 25-year-old pact that had become somewhat outmoded in the digital age.
But many of these innovations were drawn from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which included Canada and Mexico, and it prompted a senior Trump adviser to offer a rare endorsement of an Obama legacy achievement that Mr. Trump delighting in dismantling.
"We're building on what was done in T.P.P.," said Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative. "I'm in no way trying to knock the people that negotiated T.P.P."
But he added, "Because we had the benefit of that, our agreement is substantially better than T.P.P."
Mr. Lighthizer pointed to changes in regulations governing automobile manufacturing, which he said would bring more car production back to the United States. Under the agreement, a greater percentage of vehicles would have to be made in North America to qualify for Nafta's zero tariffs.
A significant portion of the vehicles would also have to be assembled by workers earning at least $16 an hour -- a wage floor intended to increase jobs in the United States and Canada, where wages are higher than in Mexico. While inflation will erode this wage protection over time, officials noted that the pact's terms could be reviewed every six years.
Analysts said the agreement might have an incremental impact on American automotive jobs, and might push car prices slightly higher. But Ford Motor Company said in a statement that it was "encouraged" by the accord, noting that a three-nation trade zone "will support an integrated, globally competitive automotive business in North America."
The United Steelworkers union urged caution, lamenting that the Trump administration's steel and aluminum tariffs had not been lifted as part of the deal. The commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, described those as "separate issues," and Mexico and Canada say they expect those tariffs to be worked out on a separate track. Mr. Trump said the United States was talking with Mexico and Canada about potentially replacing them with quotas. Also unresolved is whether Canada and Mexico will continue retaliatory tariffs on American products like whiskey, orange juice and chocolate.
Mr. Trump must now submit the deal to Congress, where a potential change in control from Republicans to Democrats could throw its passage into doubt. Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House minority leader, made clear on Monday that Mr. Trump's deal would not receive a rubber stamp.
But the top Senate Democrat, Chuck Schumer of New York, offered a rare endorsement of Mr. Trump's approach.
"As someone who voted against Nafta and opposed it for many years, I knew it needed fixing. The president deserves praise for taking large steps to improve it," Mr. Schumer said in a statement. He cautioned, though, that "any final agreement must be judged on how it benefits and protects middle-class families and the working people in our country."
Experts on trade delivered a mixed verdict on the agreement. Parts of it, they said, were a much-needed update to Nafta. But other parts could restrict trade in a way that would ultimately hurt American consumers and increase uncertainty for American companies.
"He started this conflagration with Mexico and Canada, as he has with other trading partners," said Daniel M. Price, a former trade adviser to President George W. Bush. "That he may put out the fires after they have destroyed significant acreage does not vindicate either the strategy or the result."
The White House is moving on several fronts to settle the trade disputes Mr. Trump started. Last week, Mr. Trump signed a revised trade agreement with President Moon Jae-in of South Korea. He and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan agreed to begin talks on a deal, after months of resistance by Tokyo.
"They finally got their act together and decided they can't win all these wars, so they're settling many of them and focusing on China," said Gary Clyde Hufbauer, a senior fellow and trade expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. "They're lining up the ducks for this gigantic battle with China."
There are no plans for trade negotiations between China and the United States, although the president's chief economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, said Mr. Trump might meet President Xi Jinping of China at a summit meeting in Argentina in late November.
On Monday, Mr. Trump raised the prospect of even more tariffs against China and said his actions were taking a toll on the Chinese economy.
Although he voiced hopes about a deal with the European Union -- and praised Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission president with whom he agreed to hold off on auto tariffs -- White House officials said the negotiations with Europe would be arduous.
Jared Kushner, the president's senior adviser and son-in-law, played a significant role in smoothing over the final sticking points between the United States and Canada, according to officials. He met informally with the Canadian foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, during the transition, and kept in touch with her, even as Mr. Trump's relationship with Mr. Trudeau became fraught.
"The relationship that we've been able to build with the countries established a lot of trust, both with the Canadians and Mexicans," Mr. Kushner told reporters. "It was through that trust that we were able to talk about a lot of these issues."
Mr. Trump and Mr. Trudeau spoke by telephone Monday morning, though Mr. Trudeau later dodged questions about whether the agreement would restore his relationship with the president.
"The relationship between the U.S. and Canadians is much deeper than just the relationship between two individuals who happen to be prime minister and president," Mr. Trudeau said.
At the White House on Monday, Mr. Trump exulted in the abbreviation for the new agreement, U.S.M.C.A., which he predicted that "99 percent of the time we'll be hearing."
That rebranding, however, may prove to be one of Mr. Trump's biggest challenges. Even in his briefing with reporters afterward, Mr. Lighthizer, a veteran trade lawyer, referred to the deal as Nafta.

Full text: There's a lot to digest in the new trade agreement that the United States, Mexico and Canada finalized in deadline-beating fashion on Sunday, starting with a name change: If the new deal is adopted by all three countries, the North American Free Trade Agreement will give way to the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement or U.S.M.C.A. It's a cosmetic change for an otherwise consequential set of revisions.
"It's not Nafta redone, it's a brand-new deal," President Trump said at the White House on Monday.
Text of the pact, released late Sunday, includes major adjustments in several key areas of the countries' trading relationships. The agreement sets new rules for automobile production, meant to incentivize production of cars and trucks in countries that pay higher wages. It reduces barriers for American dairy farmers to sell cheese, milk and other products to Canada. It retains a tribunal for resolving trade disputes that the United States had sought to eliminate.
It guarantees Canadian and Mexican manufacturers expanded access to some large American markets, such as cars and light trucks, but leaves lingering questions about their ability to avoid tariffs on steel and aluminum exports to the United States.
Here are highlights from the text of the agreement, and from the 12 "side letters" the negotiating countries filed alongside it.
An attempt to steer more car production to the United States
Nafta required automakers to produce 62.5 percent of a vehicle's content in North America to qualify for zero tariffs. The new agreement raises that threshold, over time, to 75 percent. That's meant to force automakers to source fewer parts for an "Assembled in Mexico" (or Canada) car from Germany, Japan, South Korea or China.
For the first time, the new agreement also mandates that an escalating percentage of parts for any tariff-free vehicle -- topping out at 40 percent in 2023 -- must come from a so-called "high wage" factory. The agreement says those factories must pay a minimum of $16 an hour in average salaries for production workers. That's about triple the average wage in a Mexican factory right now, and administration officials hope the provision will force automakers to shift suppliers from Mexico to Canada or the United States.
There are risks to that change. Automotive analysts have warned that the provision could have a damaging effect for Americans, by raising costs for American car buyers and incentivizing automakers to move production to low-cost countries outside the United States, such as China.
Conversely, the final provision, as written, could prove relatively ineffective at shifting production -- because it is not indexed to inflation. An average wage of $16 an hour will be less constraining in 2023 dollars than it is today.
Relief from future auto tariffs for Canada and Mexico
Mr. Trump has repeatedly threatened, over the last year, to impose tariffs on imported automobiles. In a news conference last week, he suggested that Canada would face such tariffs if it did not reach agreement with the United States on a new trade deal. Mr. Trump's administration has undertaken an investigation that could lead to auto tariffs, but it appears unlikely to finish up any time soon. The threat of auto tariffs has clouded trade talks with several countries, including Japan and South Korea, which import cars and car parts into America.
Canada and Mexico won't have to sweat it, though. The new agreement includes side letters that grant exemptions from any future American tariffs to 2.6 million imported passenger vehicles from each of those countries. That's slightly more vehicles than Mexico has exported to the United States over the last year, and nearly 1 million more than Canada has exported.

Wins for American cheese (and wine)
Perhaps the biggest sticking point in negotiations over the last month was the issue of Canada's protection of its dairy market, including limits on imported dairy products from the United States and government support that gives Canadian products an advantage on international markets against American ones.
"Dairy was a deal breaker," Mr. Trump said on Monday.
The new agreement gives the United States victories on both fronts. It gradually opens the Canadian market to more exported American dairy products, including "fluid milk, cream, butter, skim milk powder, cheese and other dairy products." Canada agreed to eliminate a program that helps Canadian sellers of certain milk products, at home and abroad.
It also creates a list of cheese names that Mexico and the United States agree can be marketed without restriction in their respective countries, and it forces grocery stores in British Columbia to stop their practice of selling British Columbia-only wines on certain shelves, and stock American wines alongside them.
A win for Canada on dispute resolution
Trade agreements typically come with enforcement mechanisms. As part of its renegotiation efforts, the United States sought to eliminate one of those mechanisms in Nafta: the so-called Chapter 19 provision, which gives the three countries a sort of neutral playing site -- a panel with representatives from each country -- to challenge each other's impositions of tariffs, and other actions.
Canada won the fight to keep that provision in the revised agreement. It did agree to eliminate another form of enforcement between the United States and Canada, which allows investors to sue for relief from foreign countries' actions. Consumer groups have long criticized that resolution mechanism, contending it allows large corporations too much power to challenge environmental and other regulations. The new deal leaves that mechanism in place for disputes between the United States and Mexico, but not for Canada.
Goodies for unions, banks and pharmaceutical companies
Among the small-but-significant items in the new agreement are a measure to push Mexico to make it easier for workers to form and join labor unions, steps to allow American financial services companies better access to Canadian and Mexican markets and a provision to extend the intellectual property protections of American pharmaceutical companies selling prescription drugs in Canada.
That last provision will grant longer protections to American biologic drugs, against biosimilar competitors, and it will probably raise the profits of those drugmakers when they sell in Canada.

Full text: Sometimes the most important economic events announce themselves with huge front-page headlines, stock market collapses and frantic intervention by government officials. Other times, a hard-to-explain confluence of forces has enormous economic implications, yet comes and goes without most people even being aware of it.
In 2015 and 2016, the United States experienced the second type of event.
There was a sharp slowdown in business investment, caused by an interrelated weakening in emerging markets, a drop in the price of oil and other commodities, and a run-up in the value of the dollar.
The pain was confined mostly to the energy and agricultural sectors and to the portions of the manufacturing economy that supply them with equipment. Overall economic growth slowed but remained in positive territory. The national unemployment rate kept falling. Anyone who didn't work in energy, agriculture or manufacturing could be forgiven for not noticing it at all.
Yet understanding this slump -- think of it as a mini-recession -- is important in many ways.
It helps explain the economic growth spurt of the last two years. The end of the mini-recession in the spring of 2016 created a capital spending rebound that began in mid-2016, and it has contributed to speedier growth since. Oil prices have reached four-year highs, a major factor in a surge in business investment this year.
It helps explain some of the economic discontent evident in manufacturing-heavy areas during the 2016 elections. It offers warnings for where the next downturn might come from, and shows how important it is for policymakers to remain watchful and flexible about unpredictable shifts in the global economy.
Most important, the mini-recession of 2015-16 offers a cautionary tale for any policymaker who might want to think of the United States as an economic island.
The episode is stark evidence of the risk the Trump administration faces in threatening economic damage to negotiate leverage with other nations on trade and security. What happens overseas can return to American shores faster and more powerfully than once seemed possible.
How it happened
The mini-recession defies neatness. It's a story of spillovers and feedback loops and unintended consequences. But here's a summary:
In 2015, Chinese leaders were concerned that their economy was experiencing a credit bubble, and they began imposing policies to restrain growth. These worked too well and caused a steep slowdown. That in turn caused troubles in other emerging nations for whom China was a major customer.
Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve, finally growing confident that the United States economy was returning to health, made plans to end its era of ultra-easy monetary policy.
As the Fed moved toward tighter money, its counterparts at the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan were going in the opposite direction. The prospect of higher interest rates in the United States and lower rates in the eurozone and Japan fueled a steep rise in the value of the dollar on global currency markets.
That in turn made China's problems worse. China had long pegged the value of its currency to the dollar, so a stronger dollar was also making Chinese companies less competitive globally. When China attempted to reduce this burden by loosening the peg in August 2015, it faced capital outflows, making the economic situation worse.
Moreover, across major emerging markets, many companies and banks had borrowed money in dollars, so a stronger dollar made their debt burdens more onerous.
Put it all together, and when the Fed moved toward raising interest rates -- as it eventually did in December 2015 -- it was essentially making financial conditions tighter and therefore slowing growth across big swaths of the world.
The slowdown across emerging markets, in turn, meant less demand for oil and many other commodities. That helped cause their prices to fall. The price of a barrel of West Texas Intermediate crude oil fell to under $30 in February 2016 from around $106 in June 2014. The drops in the prices of metals like copper and aluminum, and agricultural products like corn and soybeans, were also steep.
That only heightened the economic pain for the many emerging economies that are major commodity producers, such as Brazil, Mexico and Indonesia.
Given falling prices and high debt loads among energy producers in the United States, the markets for stocks and riskier corporate bonds came under stress, especially in early 2016. That generated losses for investors and fears about the overall stability of the financial system.
Each of these forces has connections to the others. It wasn't one problem, but an intersection of a bunch of them. That made it devilishly hard to diagnose, let alone to fix, even for the people whose job was to do just that.
The view from Washington
When Federal Reserve officials meet eight times a year to set interest rate policy, their job, assigned by Congress, is to figure out what is best for the United States economy. Their job isn't to set a policy that will be best for China or Brazil or Indonesia.
Entering 2015, things were looking pretty good for the United States.
Inflation was below the 2 percent level the Fed aims for, but the traditional economic models on which the central bankers had long relied predicted that it would start to rise thanks to a rapidly falling unemployment rate.
Even when prices for oil and other commodities started falling in the middle of the year, the Fed's models viewed it as a positive for the overall economy. Sure, some oil drillers and farmers might experience lower incomes, but consumers everywhere would enjoy cheaper gasoline and grocery bills.
Although officials spent a lot of time monitoring the global economy, the fact remained that the United States wasn't as dependent on exports as many smaller countries. The 2008 financial crisis had shown how the American and European banking systems were deeply intertwined, but the same couldn't be said of the ties with Chinese banks.
In other words, through the summer of 2015 it sure looked to many Fed officials as if the sound move was to start raising interest rates.
At the Treasury Department, which is responsible for the United States' currency policies, it seemed well into 2015 that the strengthening dollar was mostly benign.
"There was a sense that the U.S. was doing well and the rest of the world was not doing very well," said Nathan Sheets, a Treasury under secretary at the time and now chief economist at PGIM Fixed Income. "It was driven by strong U.S. fundamentals."
But in late summer 2015, financial markets started to react more violently to the feedback loop of global currencies and commodities. It started to seem as if some of the old rules of thumb -- about how a rising dollar or falling oil prices might affect the economy -- might not apply.
Perhaps the economics models used by forecasters had become outdated, failing to fully account for the ways surging energy production had become more intertwined with the manufacturing sector and the financial markets.
"These things were all interconnected in different ways, and they all cycled back on the same industries and parts of the economy," said Jay Shambaugh, a member of the Obama White House Council of Economic Advisers at the time. Still, distilling that complex story into crisp memos for senior officials was no easy task.
"You have to make memos short and to the point in the White House, and it was hard to say what exactly we thought was happening," he said.
Behind closed doors at the Fed, officials started debating whether this outburst of volatility in markets really posed a risk to the overall economy. Should they stick to their plans to raise interest rates steadily, or slow down?
Over two days in October, the debate played out publicly.
Stan Fischer, the vice chairman of the Fed, was reluctant to adjust the planned rate increases, not wishing to let swings in financial markets dictate policy.
"We do not currently anticipate that the effects of these recent developments on the U.S. economy will prove to be large enough to have a significant effect on the path for policy," he said in a speech in Lima, Peru, on Oct. 11, 2015.
Lael Brainard, a Federal Reserve governor who had worked on international issues at the Treasury, was quite a bit more worried.
"There is a risk that the intensification of international cross currents could weigh more heavily on U.S. demand directly, or that the anticipation of a sharper divergence in U.S. policy could impose restraint through additional tightening of financial conditions," she said on Oct. 12 in Washington.
Ms. Brainard was right.
How the damage played out
The vicious circle of a stronger dollar, weaker emerging market growth and lower commodity prices caused spending on certain types of capital goods to plummet starting in mid-2015.
Spending on agricultural machinery in 2016 fell 38 percent from 2014 levels; for petroleum and natural gas structures -- think oil drilling rigs -- the number was down a whopping 60 percent.
The oil and gas exploration boom tied to fracking technology came to a halt with energy prices at rock-bottom levels, and with it sales of equipment tied to that boom.
With the fall in domestic capital investment in those industries and with weakness overseas, companies in related industries took it on the chin. Caterpillar, the maker of heavy equipment, had 30 percent lower revenue in 2016 than 2014.
In large segments of the economy, by contrast, it was business as usual. Business spending on investments like computers and office buildings kept rising, as did consumer spending.
Still, the industrial sector downturn was powerful enough to turn a strong expansion into a weak one. Overall growth fell to 1.3 percent in the four quarters ended in mid-2016, from 3.4 percent in the preceding year.
The national economy kept adding jobs. But Harris County, Tex., which encompasses energy-centric Houston and its near suburbs, shed 0.8 percent of its jobs in that span. In Peoria, Ill., hometown of Caterpillar, employment fell 3.2 percent.
In effect, this was a localized recession -- severe in certain places, but concentrated enough that it did not throw the overall United States economy into contraction.
In Williston, N.D., where the economy had been booming for years because of a surge in oil and natural gas drilling on the Bakken oil patch, businesses of all types closed or slashed wages.
"It varies week to week, but every week keeps getting worse," Marcus Jundt, owner of a restaurant, the Williston Brewing Company, told CNBC in March 2016. "We don't know where the bottom is, but we're not there yet."
But it could have been worse.
How it ended
When Janet Yellen assumed leadership of the Federal Reserve in early 2014, she inherited an economy that had been expanding steadily for years, with a great deal of help from the Fed's interest rate policies.
Deciding how and when to pull that support -- when to raise interest rates, which had been near zero for more than six years -- was set to be the defining choice of her tenure.
In 2015, with signs that the United States economy was returning to health, she and her colleagues believed it was time to begin raising interest rates. She is a leading labor market scholar who spent a career studying, among other things, how a tight labor market can eventually feed through to inflation.
In July of that year, with stirrings of the emerging markets disruption, the unemployment rate was 5.2 percent, not much above the level Fed officials believed was consistent with a fully healthy labor market. Then the turmoil of August began.
Ms. Yellen elected not to raise rates in September, waiting for more evidence that the economy was truly on track and that the emerging market troubles wouldn't do too much damage to the domestic economy. But by December she judged that the situation had stabilized enough to raise rates.
At the same time, the Fed revealed forecasts indicating that its senior officials expected to raise interest rates four more times in 2016. Within weeks, global markets were sending a message: Not so fast.
The dollar kept strengthening, the price of commodities kept falling, and the Standard & Poor's 500 dropped about 9 percent over three weeks in late January and early February. Bond yields plummeted, suggesting that the United States was at risk of recession.
In mid-February 2016, the financial leaders of the world's most powerful nations were set to convene in a Shanghai for the periodic G20 summit. With global markets in turmoil, the great question was: Can the officials rein in these forces?
The official statement released by the participants in the summit contained multiple nods to the turbulence, acknowledging risks from "volatile capital flows" and falling commodity prices. But more important than any words was what followed in the following weeks.
Two days after the summit, China lowered its reserve requirement on banks, essentially opening the spigot for more lending. In the months that followed, it would put in tighter controls on the movement of capital outside the country, and seek to tie the value of the yuan less closely to the dollar.
Three weeks after the summit, the Fed had another policy meeting. Rather than raise interest rates further as had been envisioned in December, Fed officials declined to raise rates -- and steeply reduced their expectations of how much further they would raise rates over the remainder of 2016.
Together, these steps were enough to end the vicious cycle. The dollar stopped appreciating and started dropping. Oil prices bottomed out and began a recovery. In the United States, capital spending was growing again by the summer of 2016.
What really happened in Shanghai?
Some analysts of financial markets have put a conspiratorial bent on the concerted action from the two sides of the Pacific, speculating that leaders had made a secret deal at the G20 meeting in February 2016. They call it the "Shanghai Accord"-- essentially, that the Fed would hold off on rate increases if the Chinese also took actions of their own.
Ms. Yellen said it's not so. She said in an interview that there was an extensive exchange of views and information with the Chinese delegation in Shanghai, but that there were no promises or explicit agreements.
"I realize it looked to much of the world like some kind of secret handshake deal," she said. "This wasn't a deal. This was the global economy and capital markets affecting the U.S. outlook, and the Fed being sensitive to that, taking that into account and its influencing policy appropriately."
The Fed, she said, did what it thought was best for the United States economy without knowing exactly what the Chinese would do.
Mr. Sheets, the former Treasury official, also dismissed the idea of some secret agreement.
"It's just not how it works," he said. "There were a lot of meetings. A lot of bilaterals and quadrilaterals. You meet with your counterparts and talk about the global economy and think about the challenges and what might be done. But there was nothing agreed behind closed doors that was not part of the formal statement."
Even if there was no formal secret agreement, the result -- leaders of the world's two biggest economies squarely focused on the risks that the situation presented -- turned out to be enough.
The lessons
The impact of the global commodity-currency spiral of 2015-16 is evident from a glance at the economic statistics. It is less so in the economic debates of 2018.
First, while the Trump administration has claimed full credit for a surge in business investment, the bounce-back from the mini-recession is a major factor.
White House economists have presented charts showing a surge starting in the fourth quarter of 2016, when the election took place. But that turnaround began in mid-2016 by most measures, not late 2016 as suggested by the White House's "six quarter compound annual growth rate" measure.
Second, the mini-recession might well have affected some political attitudes during the 2016 election. While the economy was in pretty good shape for people in large cities on the coasts, 2016 was rough for a lot of people in local economies heavily reliant on drilling, mining, farming or making the machines that support those industries.
A poll in October 2016 by an agriculture trade publication, Agri-Pulse, found that 86 percent of farmers were dissatisfied with the way things were going in the United States.
Third, economic policymakers need to display the flexibility to respond to incoming information, even when it doesn't fit their own forecasts or preconceptions.
If Ms. Yellen had been more stubborn about sticking to the plan to keep raising rates through 2016 because of her training as a labor market economist, the result might well have been an actual recession. "She's always learning," said Julia Coronado, president of MacroPolicy Perspectives, "and not so egotistical that she's wedded to one view of the world."
Finally, it shows the global economy is so interconnected that events in Shanghai or São Paulo can cause unpredictable effects in faraway places.
In the last year, the Trump administration has been lobbing tariffs at China and other major economic partners to extract more advantageous terms for trade. But the mini-recession warns of the risk of ricochet.
Like it or not, the complexity of our global connections means that policy can't just focus on the home front. In 2016, we learned that lesson the hard way, even if not everybody was paying attention.

Full text: It's no wonder that Social Security is politically contentious. The program's reach is vast: More than 175 million workers contribute to it with every paycheck, and about 43 million retirees collect monthly benefits. For three in five older Americans, those checks account for more than half their income. Every two years, voters -- whether they already count on Social Security, expect to or question paying into the program -- must try to make sense of competing claims about it and which lawmakers to entrust it to. This year's midterm elections are no exception.
Speaking at a rally in Montana this month for a Republican Senate candidate, President Trump asserted that Democrats would "hurt your Social Security so badly." Most Democrats have suggested preserving or expanding the program. Republicans generally favor scaling it back.
Mr. Trump's top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, said in a recent interview that the administration had to be tougher on spending and would begin to consider the "the larger entitlements" -- Social Security and Medicare are the two biggest social insurance programs -- "probably next year."
Social Security faces a projected shortfall in about 16 years, when benefits for all recipients -- present and future -- would be cut by roughly 20 percent. How hard would it be to close the gap, and what plans are there for doing it?
"There remains a great deal of misinformation and misconceptions about Social Security," said William Arnone, chief executive of the National Academy of Social Insurance, a nonpartisan group of social insurance experts.
Here's a guide to clear up some of the confusion:
To what degree do Americans rely on Social Security?
Signed into law by Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1935, Social Security was created to mitigate the risks for workers in an increasingly industrialized economy. Over time, it came to be seen as one leg of a "three-legged stool of retirement" (pensions and savings were the others). With pensions vanishing and the savings rate dismal, millions of retirees now rely on Social Security for a big slice, if not most, of their income.
The average monthly check is $1,413. For about one in three older people receiving benefits, that check accounts for 90 percent of income, according to the Social Security Administration.
What's behind the looming shortfall?
This year, for the first time since 1982, benefits and administrative expenses are projected to exceed total income. As a result, the program will begin dipping into the reserves in its trust fund. That fund has a $2.9 trillion surplus collected when revenue -- most of it from payroll taxes paid by workers and their employers -- exceeded costs. The fund will be depleted by 2034, according to the latest annual report from the agency's trustees. That's when benefits would fall by 21 percent for everyone.
The shortfall is largely a product of demographic shifts: A large number of baby boomers are collecting Social Security, a declining birthrate is producing fewer workers to pay taxes into the system and retirees are living longer.
Does Social Security contribute to the federal budget deficit?
It depends on whom you ask, but the simple answer is no.
Roosevelt intended the program to be self-sufficient. It has a dedicated revenue source, primarily from those payroll taxes. In many cases, workers split the burden with their employers; each currently pays 6.2 percent on earnings up to $128,400, for a total of 12.4 percent. (By law, Social Security, unlike Medicare, cannot use money from the general budget to pay benefits.)
The payroll taxes go into the trust fund. When there is a surplus, the extra money is invested in a special type of Treasury security that pays interest to the trust fund.
Because it is invested in Treasury securities, the money is essentially being lent to the federal government to use however it wants, and must eventually be repaid.
That is where confusion sometimes arises about how Social Security is used to pay for things unrelated to the program. But it is really no different from what happens when the government sells Treasury securities to other investors, like China.
Although Social Security is considered "off budget," economists and government prognosticators may also view it as part of the so-called unified budget, which includes all federal activities when evaluating everything that affects the economy. From that perspective, Social Security can make the deficit look larger.
What can be done to close the shortfall?
There are various moves that could shore up the program. Potential fixes generally involve raising taxes, reducing benefits or some combination of the two.
One idea that is often floated is to tax a broader base of workers' incomes. For instance, the cap on how much income is taxed could be lifted above the current $128,400. Another option would be to raise the tax rate above the 12.4 percent now split between workers and employers.
One way to cut costs would be to raise the age at which workers become eligible for a full retirement benefit. This last occurred in 1983, when the age for collecting full benefits gradually rose to 66 and then 67 from 65 (that's still being phased in now).
What do Americans support?
Social Security is one thing most Americans seem to agree on. Polls consistently show that they prize and want to protect their benefits. A 2017 poll from the Pew Research Center found that 86 percent of Republicans and 95 percent of Democrats supported maintaining or increasing spending on Social Security.
Where does Congress stand?
Republicans and Democrats have starkly different ideas, which fall into two broad categories: Democrats favor raising revenue through taxes; Republicans support measures to reduce benefits, or to at least slow their growth. Experts cite a couple of bills as illustrating the two parties' general philosophies on the issue.
More than 170 House Democrats, nearly the entire caucus, have co-sponsored a bill by Representative John B. Larson of Connecticut that would generally increase benefits by 2 percent (more for people with lower lifetime income; less for those with higher incomes), set a minimum benefit for low-income earners and adopt a potentially faster-rising cost of inflation adjustment than the one now in effect because it takes into account that older people tend to spend proportionally more on medical care.
To pay for those changes and for the coming shortfall, the legislation would apply payroll taxes to wages above $400,000 (not indexed for inflation, meaning that, eventually, all earnings would be covered). It would also gradually raise the payroll tax over 24 years by 1.2 percentage points to 7.4 percent for workers and employers.
Although Representative Sam Johnson, Republican of Texas, is retiring, a bill he introduced in 2016 includes the types of changes that Republicans typically support. Among other things, it would gradually raise the age at which retirees can claim full benefits to 69.
In practice, that would amount to a significant benefit cut, according to an analysis by Melissa M. Favreault, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute who studies social insurance programs and models the effects of different policy changes. Based on the Social Security Administration's actuaries' review of Mr. Johnson's proposal, Ms. Favreault calculates that a retiree would either have to forgo two years of benefits, or receive a check that was 13.3 percent smaller at 67. This change would affect people born in 1968 and later. Those born from 1961 to 1967 would see smaller cuts. (Mr. Johnson's office confirmed the accuracy of Ms. Favreault's calculations.)
Mr. Johnson's proposal would also change the benefit formula so that higher-than-average earners would receive less while the lowest earners got more. Another provision would cut benefits for people who had more variable earnings or people who spent long periods not working, Ms. Favreault said. The plan also proposes using a cost-of-living adjustment that grows more slowly, and the creation of a minimum benefit.
Has the Trump administration taken steps that affect Social Security?
A couple of relatively recent actions would hurt the trust fund slightly over the next decade, but would have a negligible long-term effect. The tax law enacted last year has a "significant net negative effect" over the next 10 years, according to the 2018 annual trustees' report, and the proposed elimination of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program, would also reduce program revenue.
What are the prospects for an agreement that fixes the program?
The last time Congress made significant adjustments to close a shortfall, in 1983, both Democrats and Republicans had to make concessions. Some policy experts said they believed the parties were more polarized now, making such an agreement more difficult.
"It will require some very substantial give by both parties to make it happen," said Charles Blahous, a senior research strategist at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University.
The sooner that giving starts, experts agree, the less drastic the changes will need to be.

'Bright' Time For Economy Sways Fed To Raise Rate

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve's chairman, Jerome H. Powell, said on Wednesday that the American economy was experiencing "a particularly bright moment" as the Fed announced a widely expected increase in its benchmark interest rate and signaled that it planned to continue raising rates. Mr. Powell emphasized that the decision to raise rates to a range between 2 and 2.25 percent was not intended to get in the way of continued growth. "My colleagues and I are doing all we can to keep the economy strong, healthy and moving forward," he said.
But the Fed's decision was criticized almost immediately by President Trump, who opened a Wednesday afternoon news conference by declaring himself "not happy" with higher rates.
Mr. Trump once again broke with the practice of his recent predecessors, who avoided public comment about monetary policy. Higher interest rates increase the cost of federal borrowing and Mr. Trump, whose fiscal policies have sharply increased the scale of federal borrowing, suggested he would prefer lower borrowing costs. "We could do other things with the money," he said.
He added, however, that the Fed was raising rates "because we're doing so well."
The Fed's decision, announced after a two-day meeting of its Federal Open Market Committee, which sets monetary policy, represents the eighth time that the Fed has raised interest rates since the 2008 financial crisis, and the third time this year. Another increase is expected in December.
The Fed described economic conditions as "strong." It predicted that growth this year could top 3 percent, before slowing in coming years. Unemployment remains low, inflation remains around the 2 percent pace the Fed regards as optimal, and the pace of investment has increased, it said.
For the first time in recent years, the Fed did not describe monetary policy as "accommodative," indicating that its benchmark interest rate is rising back toward a level the Fed regards as neutral, meaning that monetary policy is neither stimulating nor restraining economic growth.
Mr. Powell emphasized, however, that the change in wording was not intended to signal any change in policy. He said monetary policy remained accommodative at the moment.
A number of Mr. Powell's colleagues have argued publicly that the Fed most likely needs to raise rates to a level that begins to restrict economic activity. The Fed warned last year that there was no need for a tax cut in the midst of a steady economic expansion. Mr. Trump and Congress ignored that advice, cutting taxes and increasing spending. The result has been a short-term increase in economic growth, which some Fed officials fear could lead to higher inflation.
Mr. Powell said that gradual rate increases remained the best way for the Fed to navigate between the danger the economy will overheat and cause inflation, and the danger the economy will falter.
"We think that gradually raising interest rates is the way that we take both of those risks seriously," he said.
Mr. Powell also said that the Fed sees little sign of inflationary pressure.
In a new round of forecasts the Fed published Wednesday, members of the policymaking committee predicted the central bank would raise rates five more times by the end of 2020.
Asked if he agreed, Mr. Powell emphasized his uncertainty about both the medium-term economic outlook and the path of Fed policy. He described the prospect of restrictive monetary policy as "very possible" but added that "it depends" on the evolution of economic conditions.
Speaking before Mr. Trump issued his latest criticisms of Fed policy, Mr. Powell said that the Fed was carrying out its mission and that "we don't consider political factors."
But Mr. Trump's policies, if not his politics, could surely influence the Fed's trajectory given uncertainty about the trade war the president has started with China, the European Union, Canada and Mexico.
Mr. Powell said that the Fed was hearing "a rising chorus of concerns from businesses all over the country" about the economic impact of those tariffs. But Mr. Powell added that the Fed has yet to see a negative effect in the economic data.
The Fed chairman outlined some areas in which the president's policies might bring surprises on the upside.
Republicans argued that tax cuts would increase economic growth by creating "supply side" incentives for increased investment in the economy. Mr. Powell said it was too early to judge the effects, but "we hope they're huge."
He also expressed hope that the Fed would continue to be surprised by the number of Americans who are returning to the labor force as the economy strengthens.
A few Fed officials, and a larger group of outside economists, argue the Fed is moving too quickly to raise rates. They point to the slow pace of wage growth as evidence there is still considerable slack in the labor market. Mr. Powell acknowledged Wednesday that the gains from economic growth have not been distributed evenly.
"The benefits of this strong economy have not reached all Americans," he said.
In the Fed's latest batch of economic projections, 12 of the 16 officials who submitted forecasts said they expected to raise rates in December.
Fed officials predicted three rate increases in 2019 and one in 2020. The new forecasts, which included 2021 for the first time, showed that Fed officials expect to end the current rate increase cycle in 2020. None are planned in 2021. That means the march toward higher rates is well past the halfway point: Eight increases in hand, five more planned.
Markets continue to anticipate fewer rate increases in coming years, in part because of doubts that the economy will continue to grow.
"Our view is that the Fed will press ahead with gradual rate hikes for now, but that officials are still underestimating just how quickly the economy is likely to lose momentum next year, as the fiscal boost fades and monetary tightening bites," said Michael Pearce, senior United States economist at Capital Economics. "We expect the Fed to call time on rate hikes and ultimately begin cutting rates by early 2020."
So far, there is little sign the Fed is crimping economic growth. Consumer borrowing costs are rising, but rates remain quite low by historical standards. The average rate on a 30-year mortgage loan reached 4.55 percent in August, up from 3.96 percent in December 2015, according to Freddie Mac.
As rates climb, the economic effects are likely to increase. Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive, said the Fed's rate increases have raised the cost of the average payment on a five-year car loan by about 2 percent.
"It will not get better for consumers or the industry from here," Mr. Smoke said.

Full text: Stock indexes dipped Wednesday after the United States Federal Reserve took the latest step in its campaign to pull interest rates gradually higher. The decision to raise the federal funds rate for a third time this year was widely expected, and stocks initially climbed following the announcement. But the gains faded in the last 30 minutes of trading after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell finished speaking at a news conference. The sharpest losses came from financial stocks, hurt by a drop in Treasury yields, which can crimp lending profits for banks.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 9.59 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,905.97 after being up as much as 0.5 percent earlier in the day. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 106.93, or 0.4 percent, to 26,385.28, and the Nasdaq composite lost 17.11, or 0.2 percent, to 7,990.37.
Powell said that the United States economy is in a "particularly bright moment," which would point to continued increases in rates. But he also said that inflation does not seem likely to spike, which would allow the Fed to continue on its gradual path to raise rates off the record lows they set following the 2008 financial crisis.
Investors spent the most energy Wednesday parsing a phrase that the Fed dropped from its written statement following its rate decision, one that has been included for years, about how the central bank is being "accommodative" and keeping rates low. Did that mean the Fed would shade toward being less aggressive or more?
But Powell said in the press conference that losing the phrase was not a signal of any change in policy expectations.
Investors closely follow every clue about interest rates, which affect the flow of money and the broad economy, because high rates in the past have been the death knell for economic expansions and bull runs for stocks. But analysts say markets can continue to climb as long as this rise in rates is gradual.
"We have more room to run in this economic cycle," said Jon Adams, senior investment strategist for BMO Global Asset Management.
The Fed indicated Wednesday that it expects to raise rates one more time this year, three times in 2019 and once in 2020.
Treasury yields dipped on Wednesday, a step back from their steady rise this year.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 3.05 percent from 3.10 percent late Tuesday. It had been close to its highest level since 2011. The two-year Treasury yield, which more closely tracks movements by the Fed, dipped to 2.82 percent from 2.83 percent.
Brian Nick, chief investment strategist at Nuveen, said that it was puzzling that both stocks and bond yields fell following the Fed's move. Usually, when investors think the Fed is going to become more aggressive about raising interest rates, stocks fall but bond yields rise.
Nick said the reaction may be a result of the new 2021 forecasts the Fed gave for the unemployment rate and G.D.P. growth.
Among stocks in the S.&P. 500, the biggest drop came from Cintas, which provides workers' uniforms, restroom supplies and other products to companies. The company reported better earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected, but growth in rentals fell short of some forecasts. Cintas lost $11.80, or 5.5 percent, to $201.16.
On the winning side was SurveyMonkey's parent company, SVMK, which surged in its first day of trading. After pricing its initial public offering of stock at $12 per share, SVMK jumped as high as $20.00 during the morning. It closed at $17.24, up 43.7 percent.
Benchmark United States crude oil fell 1 percent to $71.57 per barrel.
Gold dropped $6.00 to $1,194.00 an ounce.
The dollar dipped to 112.85 Japanese yen from 112.93 yen late Tuesday. The euro slipped to $1.1744 from $1.1766, and the British pound fell to $1.3184 from $1.3186.

Full text: BERLIN -- A year ago, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey told Germans of Turkish origin not to vote for Chancellor Angela Merkel, branding her governing coalition "enemies of Turkey." On Thursday, Mr. Erdogan is arriving in Berlin for a full state visit, complete with military honors, a state banquet and a lunch with Ms. Merkel.
The rapprochement is striking and no coincidence: With Turkey suffering the aftershocks of its worst economic crisis in 15 years, Mr. Erdogan has radically changed tune and toned down his anti-Western rhetoric.
"We want to completely leave behind all the problems and to create a warm environment between Turkey and Germany just like it used to be," he said earlier this week.
For Germany, the aim of this week's state visit in Berlin, officials say, is to normalize prickly relations with an important NATO partner on Europe's southeastern flank. For Turkey, indirectly, one goal is to repair relations with the United States, which imposed sanctions this summer over the continued detention of an American pastor.
But the visit has also underscored that, like him or not, Europe has to deal with Mr. Erdogan and the reality of a budding dictator on its border. Turkey's stability -- both economic and geopolitical -- remains a strategic priority for Germany and Europe.
It is a tough pill, and the realities surrounding the divergent trajectories of the two leaders only make it harder to swallow.
Fifteen years in power already, Mr. Erdogan, his country's economic troubles notwithstanding, is secure since his re-election in June to a newly expanded presidency that has given him sultan-like powers. Ms. Merkel, now in her 13th year as chancellor and increasingly weakened at home and abroad, is considered a lame duck.
Absent a common understanding on democratic necessities, the relationship is increasingly transactional, even as the two nations remain intimately entwined, as Germany is home to about 3 million people with roots in Turkey.
What Mr. Erdogan needs is economic buttressing, and what Ms. Merkel needs is for Turkey to remain economically stable and for the Turkish leader to continue to stem the tide of refugees and migrants that pass through his country from war-torn nations -- be they Syria, Iraq or Afghanistan -- an issue that has become the chancellor's Achilles' heel.
Mr. Erdogan's economy is teetering. The Turkish lira has come under heavy pressure -- losing nearly 40 percent of its value this year -- amid high inflation and spiraling foreign debt. Turkish private sector debt amounts to more than $200 billion, and as the lira has fallen in value Turkish companies have struggled to meet payments.
If he is not quite coming to Germany chastened, with cap in hand, Mr. Erdogan is certainly looking to reassure financial markets, improve business ties and seek political support.
It is a relatively steep climb-down for Mr. Erdogan. Relations with Germany hit rock-bottom last year with weeks of acrimonious sniping, as senior officials on both sides leveled accusations ranging from blackmail and hostage-taking to using Nazi tactics and abetting terrorism. Turkish newspapers branded German foundations and journalists as spies.
Exasperated with Mr. Erdogan's jibes, and detentions of German citizens and threats to a list of its businesses in Turkey, Germany last summer announced a policy change that curtailed European economic assistance to Turkey.
Analysts say the policy has worked, though Turkish officials insist the mood has calmed because German and Turkish elections are now out of the way.
"That's the language that Erdogan understands -- but you have to be willing to speak it," said Cem Özdemir, a prominent Turkish-German lawmaker and member of the Green Party who has been a vocal critic both of Mr. Erdogan's authoritarian politics and Germany's longtime caution in countering it.
As prime minister, Mr. Erdogan had visited Germany several times in recent years. But the three-day visit this week is his first full-blown state visit as president.
The German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, whose role is largely ceremonial, had extended the invitation after Mr. Erdogan won elections in June, prompting a wave of criticism.
Ms. Merkel will attempt to make the best of it, but she is conspicuously not attending the state dinner, even as the chancellery insists the snub is not a breach of protocol
Several German lawmakers have said they would boycott proceedings by not attending the banquet as well, and by taking part in protests instead.
Bijan Djir-Sarai, the foreign policy speaker of the Free Democrats, said he could not dine with Mr. Erdogan "while German citizens sit in Turkish prisons."
Several protests are planned for Saturday, when Mr. Erdogan is scheduled to open the new central mosque of the Cologne-based Turkish-Islamic Union for Religious Affairs, or Ditib, one of Germany's largest Islamic organizations. It is financed by the Turkish government and is suspected of disseminating pro-Erdogan propaganda.
The visit comes after a recent confidence building trip by the Turkish finance minister, Berat Albayrak -- Mr. Erdogan's son-in-law and close adviser -- who sent the right messages about fiscal stability, raising interest rates and curbing expenditure.
"Very positive developments may happen soon and that will bring positive outcomes in the economy," Cemil Ertem, Mr. Erdogan's chief economic adviser, predicted of the German visits in the daily newspaper Milliyet Tuesday.
Turkish analysts, too, noted that there has been a sudden improvement in German-Turkish relations in the last two months, including the release of Germans imprisoned under Mr. Erdogan's crackdown against political opponents and critics.
Germany's foreign ministry spokeswoman, Maria Adebahr, said another German citizen had been released on Sept. 20, bringing the number of arrested Germans down to five.
Turkey's relations with the United States have worsened over the detention of the American pastor Andrew Brunson and a dozen other Turkish-Americans and consular employees. President Trump announced sanctions against Turkey early this summer, precipitating the plunge of the lira.
Though it has taken its own tough line against Turkey, Germany voiced support for Ankara, in part fearful of the effects of a teetering Turkish economy on Europe.
Still, "Germany will not and cannot bail out Turkey," said Ozgur Unluhisarcikli, the Ankara director for the German Marshall Fund of the United States, a research organization.
There is little chance of reinvigorating Turkey's accession process to European Union membership. That demands unanimity among European Union members and Turkey's backsliding on democratic standards has gone too far for European leaders to overlook it, he said.
But Germany can offer political support at a critical time. "Turkey seeks German support in fixing its relationship with the United States and fixing its economy," Mr. Unluhisarcikli said.
Both sides also have an interest in continuing, or reinforcing, an agreement under which Turkey has curbed the flow of refugees through Turkey into Europe. The arrival of more than one million migrants into Germany since 2015 continues to reverberate politically.
Despite its differences with Turkey, Germany has no interest in seeing the Turkish economy slide. German companies have also suffered from the downturn in the Turkish economy and the fall of the lira.
"We have no interest in the situation in Turkey escalating," said Mr. Özdemir, the Turkish-German lawmaker, who is attending the banquet with Mr. Erdogan, who, as he put it, would have to "suffer him."
"You can't always choose your guests," he said. "The Erdogans and Putins and Trumps of this world are a reality and we have to talk to them."
"But it's important that we get more out of this visit than nice pictures," he said. "Erdogan wants money. We need to be clear what we want: democracy, human rights, press freedom and no interference into the German-Turkish community in Germany."

Full text: Five Latin American countries and Canada on Wednesday urged the International Criminal Court to consider prosecuting senior officials in Venezuela for extensive human rights abuses, the first time that member nations have referred another member to the tribunal. In a region where leaders tend to avoid criticizing one another publicly, the step by Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Paraguay and Peru represented an extraordinary rebuke of President Nicolás Maduro.
Governments in the region have become increasingly alarmed about the economic and political crisis in Venezuela. Acute shortages of food and medicine have prompted millions to migrate, largely to neighboring countries.
The referral gives The Hague-based tribunal a renewed sense of urgency to investigate abuses in Venezuela.
"The leaders of these six countries have taken a historic step today, unprecedented in the history of the Americas, creating a crucial milestone in the interests of justice, accountability, non-repetition and reparation to the victims of the Venezuelan dictatorship," said Luis Almagro, the secretary general of the Organization of American States, in a statement.
Here are some facts about the referral to the international court and what it could mean for Venezuela:
Why did the other countries refer Venezuela?
They're overwhelmed by the unrelenting exodus of Venezuelans, which has accelerated amid soaring inflation. The United Nations estimates that 1.6 million Venezuelans have left since 2015 and that as many as 1.8 million could migrate this year.
In recent years Venezuela's neighbors have had an open-door policy, but it has come at a political cost as communities feel increasingly besieged by migrants, many of whom arrive with no savings and with serious health problems.
"The magnitude of this exodus is unprecedented in our region," President Martín Vizcarra of Peru told the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday, noting that his country has taken in some 450,000 Venezuelans. "It demands collective action by the international community."
How unusual is this step?
Highly. The court has never opened a case brought by one government against another, and governments in Latin America for decades have adhered to an unspoken rule: Stay out of the messy internal affairs of neighbors. But several have begun to see Venezuela's economic unraveling as a growing regional threat. The tide of migrants has led to spikes in crime and strained the health and education systems of other countries.
"This is a significant, historic event," said Fernando Cutz, a former senior White House official who worked on Latin America policy in the Obama and Trump administrations. "Ten years ago, it would have been impossible to think of the region turning on one of its own."
What's the gist of the referral?
In a letter signed by the six heads of state this week in New York, on the margins of the United Nations General Assembly, the countries asked the international court's top prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, to investigate human rights abuses committed by the Venezuelan government since February 2014. During that month, the government used harsh tactics to clamp down on mass protests.
The letter notes that human rights experts have documented abuses that include arbitrary detentions, extrajudicial killings, torture and sexual crimes.
Isn't the International Criminal Court already investigating Venezuela?
Yes. Ms. Bensouda announced in February that her office had launched a "preliminary examination" into allegations of large-scale human rights abuses in Venezuela. That step can lead to a formal investigation and criminal charges.
The court said it is investigating allegations that security personnel have used excessive force against demonstrators, detained members of the political opposition and subjected prisoners to "serious abuse."
The court was established in 2002 as a tribunal of last resort for war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity. Since its inception, it has indicted only Africans and has won only a handful of convictions.
How long will an investigation take?
It's unclear. Court investigations have tended to last for years, and experts said it would be highly unlikely for charges to be filed any time soon.
"Time frames at the I.C.C. are measured in years, not months," said Todd Buchwald, a former senior State Department official who oversaw global criminal justice matters from 2015 to 2017.
But the sense of urgency conveyed by neighboring countries may prompt the court to make the case a priority.
"It does telegraph to the prosecutor these states are keen to provide access to people who have fled" and may have relevant information, said Joanna Harrington, a law professor at the University of Alberta who specializes in international criminal law.
What might this achieve in the short term?
Several of Venezuela's neighbors have sought to isolate Mr. Maduro's government as he has become increasingly authoritarian in recent years.
They also have tried to create rifts within Venezuela's ruling party.
The threat of being prosecuted in The Hague "will most likely galvanize those in the inner circle to pull together," said Mr. Cutz, the former White House official. But it could prompt others on the periphery of power to turn on the government, he added.
What is the Trump administration's position?
Washington has long called on Latin American leaders to take a harder line against Venezuela. But Wednesday's referral to the court is not a move the Trump administration can endorse.
During his speech to the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday, President Trump described the crisis in Venezuela as a "human tragedy." But in the same address he also lashed out at the International Criminal Court, saying that "as far as America is concerned," the court has "no legitimacy and no authority."
This echoes comments made this month by John R. Bolton, the national security adviser, who called the court "ineffective, unaccountable, and indeed, outright dangerous." Mr. Bolton's criticism was in response to a preliminary review of allegations of abuses in Afghanistan, which may include acts committed by American military or intelligence personnel.
The State Department would not specify whether the United States supports efforts to hold Venezuelan officials accountable at The Hague.
"We encourage thorough and transparent investigations into all credible reports of abuses," the State Department said in a statement. "The crisis in Venezuela will only be resolved through the restoration of democratic governance, realistic economic policies, the rule of law, and respect for fundamental human rights and freedoms."

Explaining How Trump Broke Away From Facts In His U.N. Speech

Full text: what Mr. Trump said "In less than two years, my administration has accomplished more than almost any administration in the history of our country."
the facts
False.
Mr. Trump rattled off a list of accomplishments on the economy, tax cuts, military spending and the border -- many of them cherry-picked, exaggerated or false.
He is right that the United States stock market is soaring, and unemployment rates for Hispanics, African-Americans and Asian-Americans have reached record lows.
But he omitted less flattering indicators when describing an economy "booming like never before." For example, G.D.P. growth is healthy, but reached higher points as recently as 2014. The unemployment rate is at an 18-year low, but is higher than several months during the 1940s and 1960s. And wage growth is still slow: after adjusting for inflation, average hourly earnings increased just 0.2 percent in August.
Mr. Trump's claim of signing the "biggest" tax cut in American history is false; by various metrics, several rank higher. He misleadingly said construction on the border wall with Mexico had begun; projects to replace fencing and barriers are underway, but the administration has not begun to build a 1,000-mile-long wall. He was also wrong in characterizing recent military spending bills as "record funding." Even without adjusting for inflation, President Barack Obama signed legislation in 2010 that provided more money for the military.
Additionally, Mr. Trump has signed a relatively low number of bills when compared to other presidents, even at similar points in their terms. While he can claim major legislative victories -- on tax cuts and veterans' benefits -- he has also been unable to deliver on other key campaign promises, like the border wall and repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act.
what Mr. Trump said
"Thanks to the United States military and our partnership with many of your nations, I am pleased to report that the bloodthirsty killers known as ISIS have been driven out from the territory they once held in Iraq and Syria."
the facts
This is exaggerated.
Mr. Trump's declaration of victory is slightly premature. The Islamic State is down to its last 200 square miles, about 1 percent of the territory it previously held in Iraq and Syria, The New York Times recently reported. Pentagon officials have stressed that their job is not done.
There are still "remaining pockets" of Islamic State fighters in Syria and Iraq, and they continue to threaten the two countries' peace and security, Col. Sean J. Ryan, a Defense Department spokesman, told reporters on Sept. 18.
Defense Secretary Jim Mattis told reporters on Monday that American troops will continue to train and advise local security forces to make certain the Islamic State does not resurface. He said "fighting is ongoing" in Syria's Euphrates River Valley, where troops have been battling the Islamic State.
"I think that getting rid of the caliphate doesn't mean you then blindly say 'O.K., we got rid of it,' march out, and then wonder why the caliphate comes back,' Mr. Mattis said. "And how many times have we seen -- look at even Iraq where they're still on the hunt for them. And they're still trying to come back."
what Mr. Trump said
"The UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar have pledged billions of dollars to aid the people of Syria and Yemen, and they are pursuing multiple avenues to ending Yemen's horrible, horrific civil war."
the facts
This is misleading.
Mr. Trump is right that the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Qatar have contributed funds to ease humanitarian crises in Syria and Yemen. But his comment glosses over the three countries' roles in Yemen's civil war.
The governments of Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E. are the top two donors to the United Nations' humanitarian response plan in Yemen, contributing nearly $1 billion combined. Additionally, the two countries donated an additional $375 million through other programs, the data show. Qatar also contributed $500,000 to the United Nations response plan.
In Syria, Saudi Arabia donated $18.6 million this year to the world body's humanitarian response plan and $24.3 million in 2017. Qatar contributed $2.2 million in 2018 and $29.5 million last year, the same reports show.
Dollars aside, it's worth noting that the United Nations and human rights groups have said that the humanitarian crisis in Yemen has been exacerbated by the country's continuing civil war. A Saudi-led coalition -- including the U.A.E. and the United States -- has since 2015 fought Iranian-linked Houthi rebels who ousted the government of President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi of Yemen.
Qatar initially was part of the international coalition fighting the Houthi rebels, but was expelled last year after Riyadh accused the tiny nation of funding terrorism, cozying up to Iran and welcoming dissidents.
A report by United Nations investigators in August accused the Saudi-led coalition of potential war crimes, including charges of killing thousands of civilians in airstrikes, torturing detainees and conscripting child soldiers. The same report also accused the Houthi rebels of possible war crimes.
what Mr. Trump said
"That is why so many countries in the Middle East strongly supported my decision to withdraw the United States from the horrible 2015 Iran nuclear deal and reimpose nuclear sanctions."
the facts
This is exaggerated.
The reaction to the United States' withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal in May was more varied in Middle Eastern countries than Mr. Trump's claim would suggest.
Saudi Arabia, the U.A.E., Bahrain and Israel issued statements supporting Mr. Trump's decision.
But Syria, Iraq and Lebanon voiced disappointment. Jordan's foreign minister warned of a potential arms race in the region absent the nuclear deal. Qatar, Egypt, Kuwait and Oman issued cautious statements that stressed their commitments to peace in the Middle East, but did not take clear positions on the United States' withdrawal.
Outside of the Middle East, global reaction toward Mr. Trump's decision has largely been negative. The six other parties to the treaty with Iran -- Britain, France, Germany, China, Russia and the European Union -- opposed the withdrawal. So did Canada, Australia, Ireland, Japan, Norway, the Netherlands, South Africa and Sweden, according to statements compiled by the Arms Control Association.
what Mr. Trump said
"As a result, our trade deficit ballooned to nearly $800 billion a year."
the facts
This is exaggerated.
As The New York Times and others have repeatedly reported, Mr. Trump is overstating the figure by about $250 billion. Last year, the United States had an overall trade deficit of $552 billion, according to the Census Bureau. That included a goods deficit of $807 billion, offset by a trade surplus in services of $255 billion.
Mr. Trump's preoccupation with trade in goods contradicts his own White House economic report, which he signed and was released in February.
The American economy has shifted "away from manufacturing and toward service provision industries" in recent decades, according to the report. "Focusing only on the trade in goods alone ignores the United States' comparative advantage in services."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text: UNITED NATIONS -- President Trump thrust his commitment to an "America First" foreign policy back onto the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday. But in his second address on this diplomatic stage, he sounded as eager to claim credit for his achievements after 20 months in office, as he was to disrupt the world order. If Mr. Trump had changed, so had his audience -- no longer as daunted by the insurgent figure who left them slack-jawed last year when he vowed to "crush loser terrorists," mocked North Korea's leader as "Rocket Man" and declared that parts of the world "are going to hell."
This time, emissaries from around the world listened quietly as Mr. Trump fulminated at foes like Iran and failing states like Venezuela. They nodded as he singled out an enemy-turned-partner, Kim Jong-un of North Korea, expressing optimism for a diplomatic opening that would have seemed far-fetched even a year ago.
But when Mr. Trump declared, "In less than two years, my administration has accomplished more than almost any administration in the history of our country," the crowd broke into murmurs and laughter.
Briefly disconcerted, the president smiled and said, "I did not expect that reaction, but that's O.K."
It was a jarring moment for a leader who usually speaks to adoring crowds at "Make America Great Again" rallies, where his use of superlatives to describe his success draws reliable cheers. Mr. Trump still commands the world stage and he is still capable of upending American foreign policy with a single tweet. But after a year of such bombast, many in the audience at the United Nations treated him almost as a source of levity, not fear.
There is also evidence that foreign leaders are more willing to push back. Speaking after Mr. Trump, President Emmanuel Macron of France said the Paris climate accord had survived despite America's decision to pull out. In a not-so-subtle slap at Mr. Trump, he proposed that countries refuse to sign trade deals with those who do not comply with the accord.
On Monday, France joined Germany and Britain -- as well as the other signatories, Russia, China, and Iran -- in recommitting to the Iran nuclear accord, repudiated by Mr. Trump in May. They did so even as Mr. Trump urged Europe to isolate Iran and warned of draconian new sanctions that would penalize America's allies for not cutting off commercial ties with the Iranians.
President Hassan Rouhani of Iran criticized Mr. Trump for quitting the agreement and made clear he thought the president's offer to talk with Iran's leaders was disingenuous (earlier in the day, Mr. Trump insisted it was the Iranians who had wanted to talk).
"It is ironic that the United States government does not even conceal its plan for overthrowing the same government it invites to talks," Mr. Rouhani said.
Mr. Trump, for his part, condemned Iran's government as a "corrupt dictatorship" that had looted its people and used the windfall from the nuclear deal to finance what he described as a terrorist campaign that is destabilizing the entire Middle East.
"Iran's leaders sow chaos, death and destruction," he declared. "They do not respect their neighbors or borders, or the sovereign rights of nations."
"Not good," he added.
Shifting gears, Mr. Trump lavished praise on his efforts to shake up the established order, pointing to his withdrawal from trade deals and international organizations, his recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, and his meeting last June with Mr. Kim of North Korea, which he said had produced far more than anyone expected.
"The missiles and rockets are no longer flying in every direction," Mr. Trump said. "Nuclear testing has stopped. Some military facilities are already being dismantled. Our hostages have been released."
"I would like to thank Chairman Kim for his courage and for the steps he has taken," he said, adding, "much work needs to be done."
Mr. Trump's speech showed a president at once fickle and set in his ways. His emphasis on sovereignty was a repeat of the big theme of last year's General Assembly address, and it showed that on the core principles of his "America First" foreign policy, Mr. Trump is not budging.
Yet Mr. Trump's warm words for Mr. Kim were a 180-degree shift from 2017, when he said the North Korean leader was on a suicidal collision course with the United States. That showed he is open to radical shifts in approach, based on his idiosyncratic view of personal diplomacy and his self-avowed skill as a dealmaker in spotting opportunities.
As he did last year, Mr. Trump relied on his senior domestic adviser, Stephen Miller, for much of the speechwriting. Mr. Miller has spearheaded the White House's immigration policy and its recent decision to cut significantly the number of refugees the United States will accept.
The national security adviser, John R. Bolton, an even more ardent proponent than Mr. Trump of the virtues of sovereignty, also injected themes. In his own speech at a conference on Tuesday, Mr. Bolton alluded to the frequent description in Iran of the United States as the "Great Satan."
"If you cross us, our allies, or our partners," Mr. Bolton said, "if you harm our citizens, if you continue to lie, cheat, and deceive, yes, there will indeed be hell to pay."
For presidents, General Assembly speeches are a good guide to the evolution of their thinking. In 2009, his first year in office, Barack Obama delivered a soaring paean to the need for diplomacy and collective action. By 2014, Mr. Obama had cast off some early ambitions and dwelt instead on the threat from the Islamic State -- an enemy Mr. Trump said Tuesday had been "driven out from the territory they once held in Iraq and Syria."
Mr. Trump has not yet faced a major foreign policy crisis, and his speech reflected his good fortune. He still spoke mostly about actions he had taken to unwind the legacy of Mr. Obama.
But he also promoted his record in the Middle East, where he said his closer ties to Saudi Arabia had helped the fight against extremism, and to Israel, where he said the United States was no longer "held hostage to old dogmas, discredited ideologies, and so-called experts who have been proven wrong, over the years, time and time again."
Critics said Mr. Trump's triumphalist tone provoked the derisive reaction. "If you're boastful, and in the most improbable ways, it's just becomes outlandish," said Nicholas Burns, a senior diplomat under President George W. Bush. "It was a sad moment for American leadership."
The president expressed resentment toward a familiar array of perceived malefactors: allies, who he said did not pay their fair share for military defense; trading partners, who he said exploited unfair agreements that harmed American workers; and oil producers, whom he accused of gouging the United States and other customers.
"OPEC and OPEC nations are, as usual, ripping off the rest of the world, and I don't like it," Mr. Trump said. "Nobody should like it."
Mr. Trump also assailed countries, like China, that use industrial planning in their economies to undercut competitors on trade. The United States, he said, was systematically renegotiating what he called unfair trade deals and striking back against China's theft of intellectual property, predatory licensing agreements and the dumping of goods in the American market under President Xi Jinping.
"I have great respect and affection for my friend President Xi, but I have made clear that our trade imbalance is just not acceptable," he said. "China's market distortions, and the way they deal, cannot be tolerated."
America's other great strategic rival, Russia, went unmentioned by Mr. Trump, except for a reference to what he described as Germany's dependence on Russian energy. That was also Mr. Trump's only mention of Germany, a staunch ally, though he praised its neighbor, Poland, which has an increasingly autocratic government, for its construction of a pipeline in the Baltic Sea to diversify its energy supply.
After his speech, Mr. Trump took credit for a change in Iran's behavior since he withdrew from the nuclear deal. He claimed, without evidence, that Iran had abandoned its ambitions to build a land bridge to the Mediterranean Sea. At some point, he predicted, the United States and Iran would have "meaningful negotiations and probably do a deal."
"Iran is a much different country today than it was a year ago," he said before meeting Colombia's president, Ivan Duque Marquez. "They have riots in the street. They have horrible inflation, the worst in the world. Their currency is a disaster. Everything in Iran is failing right now."
Aside from Iran, Venezuela drew Mr. Trump's harshest critique. He described the political tumult roiling the country as a "human tragedy" and said the United States would impose new sanctions on the government of President Nicolás Maduro. Socialism, he said, had squandered Venezuela's oil resources and "driven its people into abject poverty."
Mr. Trump spoke of the great potential of the United Nations, but expressed little regard for any other international bodies. The United States, he said, had rightfully exited the Human Rights Council, refused to take part in the Global Compact on Migration or to recognize the authority of the International Criminal Court, which has recently considered investigating the conduct of American troops in Afghanistan.
The president singled out India, Saudi Arabia, Israel and Poland as worthy partners: nations that he said had distinctive traditions and cultures, patriotic societies and a fierce commitment to independence.
"Sovereign and independent nations are the only vehicle where freedom has ever survived, democracy has ever endured or peace has ever prospered," Mr. Trump declared. "And so we must protect our sovereignty and our cherished independence above all."

In Lieu of Higher Wages, Companies Turn to Perks

Full text: WASHINGTON -- One of the most perplexing questions about the nation's economic recovery is why a tight labor market has not translated into faster wage growth. Part of the answer appears to be that American workers are receiving a growing share of compensation in the form of benefits rather than wages. The average worker received 32 percent of total compensation in benefits including bonuses, paid leave and company contributions to insurance and retirement plans in the second quarter of 2018. That was up from 27 percent in 2000, federal data show. The rising cost of health insurance accounts for only about one-third of the trend. And the data do not include the increased prevalence of non-monetary benefits like flexible hours or working from home, or perks like gyms and "summer Fridays."
Best Buy, the electronics retailer, began in July to offer four weeks of paid time off to its employees, including part-time workers, to take care of family members. The company decided that paid leave was the best way to show appreciation for its employees, said Jeff Shelman, a company spokesman. "Our philosophy is that our employees are our most important asset, and we want to take care of them and allow them to take care of the people that matter most to them in their lives," he said.
The shift toward nonwage compensation has helped to persuade the Federal Reserve to keep pushing up interest rates. The central bank is expected to increase its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday for the fourth consecutive quarter, to a range between 2 and 2.25 percent. Asset prices already reflect the full increase, leaving only the formality of the Fed's announcement, scheduled for 2 p.m.
For many workers, the returns from one of the longest economic expansions in American history have been paltry. Wages have grown more slowly than the economy in the wake of the 2008 crisis, and faster growth in recent months has been offset by rising inflation. Between August 2017 and August 2018, the most recent available data, average hourly wages increased by 2.9 percent, but after adjusting for inflation, the increase was just 0.2 percent, according to the Labor Department's flagship survey.
Even including nonwage benefits, the growth of compensation is very slow by historical standards.
Some economists outside the Fed argue the weakness of wage growth is evidence that employers are still tapping a plentiful supply of workers. While the unemployment rate is just 3.9 percent, they note that an unusually large proportion of American adults are neither working nor looking for work.
Fed officials have predicted faster wage growth is on the way. But in the September edition of its "beige book" survey of economic conditions, the central bank also noted the turn toward nonwage compensation. The survey said that companies seeking workers, rather than baiting their hooks with wage increases, "were increasingly using benefits -- such as vacation time, flexible schedules and bonuses -- to attract and retain workers, as well as putting more resources into training."
The Boyd Group, a Canadian auto repair company that operates in the United States as Gerber Collision & Glass, said it was struggling to hire enough technicians to meet the demand for repairs. So the company plans to spend $4.5 million this year to sweeten benefits for its United States workers, including additional paid vacation and larger contributions to employees' 401(k) retirement accounts.
"The objective is to make ourselves a more attractive employer within the context of the collision repair industry and, therefore, take advantage of opportunities to attract people from our competitors," Brock Bulbuck, the company's chief executive, said on a conference call with investors in May.
The White House Council of Economic Advisers argued this month that the economic performance, and the benefits for workers, should be judged by the growth of total compensation rather than wages.
Even using the White House measure, there is no sign of an acceleration in compensation since President Trump took office, but Michelle Meyer, an economist at Bank of America, said it made sense to use broader measures. "I think it goes back to the idea of whether our old models are as valuable as they once were," she said. "The story changes over time, and I do think the fact that there are other ways of being compensated means that simply looking at average hourly earnings is not going to be a comprehensive measure of how the economy is responding to tightness in the labor market."
Companies have kept most of the benefits of economic growth in recent years in the form of higher profits, so the shift toward benefits appears to be a rare example of workers getting something they want, albeit a consolation prize. There is longstanding evidence that workers would prefer a larger share of compensation in the form of benefits. Unionized workers, who have greater leverage to negotiate the mix of wages and benefits, have long used that power to insist on better benefits. The average unionized worker last year received 40 percent of their compensation in the form of benefits, compared with just 29 percent for the average non-unionized worker, the federal data shows.
"Employers mostly care about the level of compensation, so the composition of it, they'd generally be glad to do what their workers want them to do," said Josh Bivens, the director of research at the liberal Economic Policy Institute. "When workers actually have an effective voice, the benefit share tends to be a little higher."
Employers, too, may prefer to offer increased compensation in the form of benefits, because they may find it easier to cut benefits during a downturn.
"You can increase benefits, bonus payments and other perks to keep your workers happy without creating a permanent adjustment in how they're compensated," Ms. Meyer said. "If they go away, it doesn't give the same perception of a change in their value to the company."
The rise in nonwage benefits is not spread evenly across the work force. Jared Bernstein, an economist at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, calculated that benefit compensation has increased 15 percent since 2009 for workers in the 90th percentile of the income distribution, while workers in the 10th percentile are receiving less such compensation than they did in 2009.
For the median worker, benefit compensation has increased 5 percent.
"When I talk with blue-collar or service workers, they're generally pretty unhappy about wage stagnation and about inadequate benefits," Mr. Bernstein said.
The benefit that appears to be in the highest demand is paid time off.
The Society for Human Resource Management, which conducts an annual survey of the benefits offered by more than 3,500 corporations, reported that the share of participants offering paid maternity leave increased to 35 percent in 2018 from 26 percent in 2016. It also reported a significant increase in the share of companies offering paid leave to fathers, adoptive parents and surrogate parents.
One recent survey reported that the share of Fortune 1000 companies offering "summer Fridays" -- days on which employees were allowed to leave early for a long summer weekend -- doubled from 21 percent in 2015 to 42 percent in 2018.
The White House Council of Economic Advisers calculates that increasingly generous paid leave benefits mean that the average American worker is getting an additional half-day of paid leave each year, compared with five years ago.
Large companies are more likely to offer such benefits. In February, Lowe's became the last company among the nation's 20 largest employers to offer paid parental leave to its salaried and full-time hourly employees. The company now pays for mothers to take 10 weeks of leave, and for fathers to take two weeks off.
In surveys, younger workers often place a greater emphasis on benefits, and some analysts expect the shift toward nonwage compensation to continue as the millennial generation replaces the baby boomers in the work force.
Ms. Meyer, the Bank of America economist, pointed to the tech industry as a harbinger. The median employer in the tech industry, she said, spends about 2.5 times as much on paid leave benefits as the median employer across the economy as a whole.

Full text: Major U.S. indexes finished mostly lower Tuesday as rising interest rates hurt stocks that pay big dividends and higher oil prices pushed transportation and shipping companies lower. The S&P 500 index fell for the third day in a row. Oil prices continued to rise after a weekend meeting of OPEC and its allies ended without an increase in oil production. That's helped energy companies, but it is pressuring airlines and other companies that will have to pay more for fuel. Higher oil prices can also ripple through the economy and increase inflation, and that's helped push interest rates higher this week.
On Wednesday the Federal Reserve is expected to increase its benchmark interest rate for the third time this year. Investors have been sure for months that the Fed would raise rates at this meeting, so they'll be focusing on the Fed's economic projections and Chairman Jay Powell's press conference afterward.
"He'll want to say as little as possible about tariffs, about fiscal policy, and say as little as possible about any advice the president may be giving him and the Federal Reserve about how to run monetary policy," said David Kelly, chief global strategist for JPMorgan Funds. But Kelly said the reporters will likely probe Powell's views on all of those topics.
The S&P 500 fell 3.81 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,915.56. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 69.84 points, or 0.3 percent, to 26,492.21. The Nasdaq composite added 14.22 points, or 0.2 percent, to 8,007.47. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks gained 3.49 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,708.80.
Bond prices kept falling as the Fed meeting began, sending yields higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 3.10 percent from 3.07 percent a day earlier.
Rising bond yields tend to hurt high-dividend companies, which many income-seeking investors see as substitutes for bonds. Among utilities, Southern Co. fell 2.5 percent to $42.73 and consumer goods maker Procter & Gamble lost 1.4 percent to $83.12.
Stocks usually do well when the Fed starts to raise interest rates because the higher rates reflect solid economic growth, which is associated with strong company profits. But as the rate increases continue, in line with the Fed's goal of keeping inflation in check, the effect on stocks can become negative as economic growth slows.
Oil prices have climbed recently because OPEC isn't producing more oil, while Iran is exporting less after the U.S. withdrew from the international nuclear deal with Iran and announced more sanctions on the country.
Benchmark U.S. crude rose 0.3 percent to $72.28 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the standard for international oil prices, rose 0.8 percent to $81.87 a barrel in London. Brent crude is at its highest price since November 2014.
ConocoPhillips rose 1.4 percent to $78.11 and Philips 66 added 1.3 percent to $114.88.
Drive-in restaurant chain Sonic jumped 18.7 percent to $43.46 after it agreed to be bought by Inspire Brands, which also owns Arby's and Buffalo Wild Wings. The purchase values Sonic at $43.50 a share, or $1.57 billion. Inspire Brands is controlled by the private equity firm Roark Capital.
XO Group, which runs the wedding marketplace The Knot, jumped 26.3 percent to $34.91 after it accepted a $907 million offer from two funds that own its competitor WeddingWire.
Companies around the world have announced $3.26 trillion in deals this year, according to Dealogic, far above the $2.49 billion in deals that were struck over the first three quarters of 2017. The recent U.S. corporate tax cut and low interest rates have contributed to that trend.
If the Fed does raise interest rates Wednesday, it would be the ninth increase since late 2015 and would take the benchmark rate to a range of 2 percent to 2.25 percent, with another increase expected this year and more to come in 2019.
Wholesale gasoline added 0.6 percent to $2.07 gallon. Heating oil rose 0.8 percent to $2.31 a gallon. Natural gas rose 1.4 percent to $3.08 per 1,000 cubic feet.
Gold rose 0.1 percent to $1,205.10 an ounce. Silver gained 1.1 percent to $14.49 an ounce. Copper fell 0.4 percent to $2.82 a pound.

Full text: Global stocks took small losses on Monday after China reportedly pulled out of trade talks with the United States. Industrial companies and banks suffered some of the worst declines among American stocks. The United States and China officially began taxing larger amounts of each other's goods on Monday, and The Wall Street Journal reported that China had pulled out of talks that could have led to a new round of negotiations to end the trade war.
The United States is now taxing another $200 billion in Chinese imports at a rate of 10 percent, and China added taxes of 5 to 10 percent on $60 billion in American products. Oil prices jumped after OPEC decided not to produce more oil.
Technology and health care companies rose, leaving United States indexes only slightly lower.
"The market's been remarkably resilient over the last couple of months while trade tensions were heating up," said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.
Sandven said that the trade spat would endure past the midterm elections in November but that stocks were likely to keep rising because of strong earnings growth for American companies, combined with low inflation and low interest rates.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 10.30 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,919.37. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 181.45 points, or 0.7 percent, to 26,562.05. Both the S.&P. 500 and the Dow set record highs last week.
The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks dropped seven points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,705.32. The Nasdaq composite rose 6.29 points, or 0.1 percent, to 7,993.25.
After a volatile stretch early this year, the S.&P. hasn't risen or fallen 1 percent in a day since late June.
Sandven noted that this year's gains have been concentrated in technology, retail and health care companies. That was the case Monday, as Apple gained 1.4 percent to $220.79 and Abbott Laboratories, which makes drugs and infant formula, advanced 3.5 percent to $71.44. Sandven said it would be an encouraging sign for the market if other sectors did better.
Investors in the United States were occupied with other news. OPEC and its key allies, like Russia, decided not to increase their oil output further. Production is falling in some OPEC nations, including Iran, which faces new sanctions from the United States.
Benchmark United States crude gained 1.8 percent to $72.08 a barrel in New York, while Brent crude, the international standard for oil prices, rose 3 percent to $81.20 a barrel in London, its highest price in more than three years.
Airlines and other transportation companies fell as investors anticipated that they would have to pay higher prices for fuel.
Late Friday, Comcast won an auction for majority control of Sky, the British satellite TV giant. Its final offer was worth about $39 billion and topped an offer from 21st Century Fox, which was already a major Sky shareholder.
In London, Sky shares jumped 8.6 percent. Comcast sank 6 percent to $35.63, while Fox rose 1.5 percent to $45.01. Disney, which is buying Fox, climbed 2.1 percent to $112.77.
Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 3.09 percent from 3.07 percent.
Gold rose to $1,199.30 an ounce. The dollar rose to 112.78 yen. The euro fell to $1.1744 from $1.1747.

Full text: Here's what to expect in the week ahead: ECONOMY
A new round of tariffs on Chinese goods.
Tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports are due to take effect on Monday as the Trump administration moves ahead with its threats to punish China for its unwillingness to lower its trade barriers. The tariffs will hit a wide array of consumer goods and will initially be levied at a rate of 10 percent. At the end of the year, if no progress is made in negotiations, the rate will rise to 25 percent. China has promised to retaliate against the latest tariffs with new duties on American products.

ECONOMY
New trans-Atlantic trade talks planned.
Robert E. Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, will meet on Tuesday in New York with Cecilia Malmstrom, the European commissioner for trade, to continue discussions about a deal to reduce tensions and eliminate barriers to trans-Atlantic commerce. The talks began this summer with a mandate to cut tariffs to zero as part of a broad free-trade pact, but negotiators appear to have scaled back their ambitions and will concentrate first on eliminating regulatory barriers that create unnecessary costs for exporters. They could agree, for example, that drugs approved in the United States would automatically be approved for sale in the European Union and vice versa.

ECONOMY
Fed expected to raise interest rates.
The Federal Reserve is expected to raise its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday for the fourth consecutive quarter. The benchmark rate, which the Fed is holding in a range between 1.75 and 2 percent, is still low enough to provide a mild dose of stimulus. As the economy keeps growing, and unemployment remains low, Fed officials want to limit inflation by raising the rate back up to a neutral level, and perhaps a little higher. Markets have already priced in a quarter-point increase on Wednesday, and investors see the odds of another quarter-point increase in December as better than 90 percent. The looming questions are about 2019. The Fed on Wednesday will also publish a new set of economic forecasts by the members of its policymaking committee, including their predictions about the course of monetary policy in the coming year.

ECONOMY
Talk of trade possible at Mnuchin event.
Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, will take questions on Thursday at an event in Washington sponsored by The Hill newspaper. Mr. Mnuchin has maintained a low profile in recent weeks as the Trump administration's trade war with China has escalated despite his efforts to restart talks. The event will offer the Treasury secretary an opportunity to explain the state of play with China as Mr. Trump's latest round of tariffs on Chinese imports takes effect.
-- Alan Rappeport
______
ECONOMY
Economic data unlikely to show effects of trade war.
Trade tensions are heating back up, with President Trump announcing a new round of tariffs on China, and China responding in kind. Data on trade and manufacturing from the Commerce Department on Thursday will help show whether the budding trade war has begun to damage the broader economy. Economists surveyed by MarketWatch mostly expect the answer to be "no." They expect preliminary trade data to show that the trade deficit narrowed slightly in August as exports rebounded from a summer slowdown, and they forecast a modest uptick in orders for durable goods, in part because of strong demand for cars and parts. But a significant slowdown in either category will be taken as evidence that tariffs are beginning to act as a drag on economic growth.

Full text: Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon and the world's wealthiest man, has been publicly agonizing over a vexing problem: what to do with all his money.
Last week, more than a year after asking his Twitter followers for philanthropic ideas, Mr. Bezos and his wife, MacKenzie, announced an initial plan. They said they would donate $2 billion to a new foundation meant to address homelessness and improve preschool education. The gift is a tiny portion of the Bezoses' total wealth -- estimated by Forbes magazine to be $162 billion -- but the foundation's name, the Bezos Day 1 Fund, suggests there will be lots more to come.
The question of how Mr. Bezos should spend his money is a good one, but a better place to start might be: Why does he have so much money in the first place? What does his fortune tell us about the economic structure and impact of the tech industry, the engine behind his billions? And, most important, what responsibility comes with his wealth -- and is it any business of ours what he does with it?
The answer: Of course it's our business.
Mr. Bezos' extreme wealth is not only a product of his own ingenuity. It is also a function of several grand forces shaping the global economy. One is the unequal impact of digital technology, which has reduced costs and brought conveniences to many, but whose direct economic benefits have accrued to a small number of superstar companies and their largest shareholders. There is also the effect of labor and economic policy, which in the United States has failed to keep up with, and often only aggravated, the problem of tech-driven concentrations of wealth.
Once you understand the forces pushing Mr. Bezos' fortune ever skyward, one strategy for how he might spend it emerges above all others. "I think the most important thing he can do with his money is to become a traitor to his class," said Anand Giridharadas, author of a new book, "Winners Take All."
In the book, Mr. Giridharadas argues that the efforts of the super-wealthy to change the world through philanthropy are often a distraction from the planet's actual problems. To truly fix the world, Mr. Bezos ought to push for policy changes that would create a more equal distribution of the winnings derived from a tech-driven economy, Mr. Giridharadas said.
"He should address himself to America's deepest problems in ways that would demand sacrifice from the winners of our age -- making a difference at the expense of their opportunity to make a killing," Mr. Giridharadas said.
There's another way of putting this: Jeff Bezos should spend his vast fortune pushing for a society where no one can ever become as rich as Jeff Bezos is now.
An Amazon spokesman declined to comment on Mr. Bezos' philanthropic plans.
Those who are fans of Amazon may argue with the notion that Mr. Bezos' wealth represents a problem and a responsibility. After all, Bezos, 54, is an uncommonly gifted businessman. He acquired his wealth legally and in the most quintessentially American way: He had a wacky idea, took a stab at it, stuck with it through thick and thin, and, through patient, deliberate, farsighted risk-taking, created one of the most innovative companies of the modern era.
But Mr. Bezos isn't just rich. He is growing unprecedentedly rich -- rich enough that his wealth, by itself, illustrates a new economic reality.
A year ago, when he first called for philanthropy ideas, Mr. Bezos' fortune was estimated at only $80 billion, putting him an embarrassing second on the rich-person list, behind Bill Gates. The ideas rolled in, but the money came in faster. As Amazon's stock price sailed ever higher, Mr. Bezos' fortune eclipsed Mr. Gates's -- and then kept climbing.
"The only way that I can see to deploy this much financial resource is by converting my Amazon winnings into space travel," Mr. Bezos told an interviewer in April.
In July, Mr. Bezos' wealth surpassed $150 billion, a record; even if inflation is accounted for, he is almost certainly the wealthiest human being in modern history. Only John D. Rockefeller, whose fortune once exceeded 2 percent of the total American economy, might plausibly have been richer. (Mr. Bezos would need to double his wealth again to beat that standard.)
Most of Mr. Bezos' wealth is tied up in Amazon's stock, so he could well lose billions if Amazon flails. But if he does, there will probably be someone else just as megarich to take his place, because extreme concentrations of wealth are baked into the dynamics of the modern tech economy.
Tech-powered businesses are often driven by an economic concept known as network effects, in which the very popularity of a service sparks even greater popularity. Amazon, for instance, keeps attracting more third-party businesses to sell goods in its store -- which in turn makes it a better store for customers, which attracts more suppliers, improving the customer experience, and so on in an endless virtuous cycle. Digital businesses are also characterized by tremendous economies of scale -- Amazon can create a robotic assistant once and deploy it to everyone -- that further entrench concentration.
"We have technology that has allowed us to create vastly more wealth for society," said Erik Brynjolfsson, director of the M.I.T. Initiative on the Digital Economy. "But there's no economic law that says that these benefits will be distributed evenly -- and it's worked out that some people have gotten most of the benefits and a lot of other people have been left behind."
But economics isn't destiny, he said.
"Technology has led to some of this concentration, but since it makes the pie bigger, you could make everyone better off simultaneously -- you could make the poor better off and the rich better off -- and whether we do that is a matter of policy," he said.
As Annie Lowrey pointed out in The Atlantic last month, economic policy is currently tilted toward benefiting people like Mr. Bezos far more than the hundreds of thousands of people who work in his warehouses. Among other policies, Amazon has capitalized on a weakened union movement and a low minimum wage, which has allowed it to expand by hiring an army of workers for its warehouses.
Amazon said that on average, its full-time warehouse workers made $15 an hour, including wages and other compensation; the company also said it provided full benefits, including tuition for career skills, to those workers. A $15 wage is higher than at some other retailers, but it is lower than estimates for what a family in the United States needs to meet its basic needs, known as a living wage.
"They're not providing the sort of high-wage, middle-class jobs to a broad swath of individuals that we used to associate with corporate success," Lawrence Katz, an economist at Harvard, said of Amazon and other high-flying tech firms. "What we're seeing is not the sharing of the productivity benefits that we used to see in the past. And that may be even more galling than the concentration of wealth."
How could Mr. Bezos address these issues through philanthropy? Mr. Giridharadas suggested several liberal economic policy ideas, among them efforts to strengthen unions, equalize how we pay for education, increase minimum-wage laws and push for a more progressive tax system. Both Mr. Gates and Warren Buffett -- the second- and third-wealthiest people in the world -- have said they should pay higher taxes.
Those ideas strike me as unlikely; Mr. Bezos is a far-thinking innovator, but he has expressed little interest in near-term political questions.
On the other hand, Mr. Bezos' most attractive quality, as a businessman, is his capacity for patience and surprise.
"This is guy who was willing to buck what everyone else thought for so long," Mr. Giridharadas said. "If he brings that same irreverence to the question of how to give, he has the potential to interrogate himself about why it is that we need so many billionaires to save us in the first place -- and what we could do to build a society that would not require Jeff Bezos to help us so much."

More U.S. Consumers May Soon Bear Duties' Toll

Full text: The Trump administration seems confident that consumers will not feel pain from its escalating trade war with China. "Because it's spread over thousands and thousands of products, nobody's going to actually notice it at the end of the day," Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told CNBC on Tuesday, when asked about the administration's latest round of tariffs on Chinese imports.
But a pain-free trade war with China is nearly impossible. For American consumers, prices have already risen on some products that the administration targeted for tariffs this year -- most notably, washing machines, which were subjected to steep tariffs in January.
It is true, as Mr. Ross noted earlier in his CNBC interview, that the administration has thus far devised such tariffs to minimize sticker shock on retail store shelves for American customers. The list of imports set to be "tariffed," as President Trump proclaimed on Monday, still does not include T-shirts, smartphones or many other popular products that American stores import from China. The $200 billion list unveiled on Monday will start with a tax of 10 percent and rise to 25 percent in the New Year, a move that should mute the effect of this round of tariffs on holiday shoppers.
Next year, though, those products will almost certainly grow noticeably more expensive. China has already vowed to retaliate, raising the possibility that Mr. Trump will announce, as soon as this week, that he plans to impose tariffs on another $267 billion in Chinese imports -- basically, everything Americans buy from their largest trading partner.
"China has been taking advantage of the United States for a long time, and that's not happening anymore," Mr. Trump said at a news conference on Tuesday. "We can't let that happen."
Tariffs are ultimately a tax on businesses and consumers, and with each new round, the administration is bringing them closer to home for the typical American.
Tariffs on thousands of products are "death by a thousand cuts," said David French, the senior vice president for government relations for the National Retail Federation, which opposes the administration's approach. "In the aggregate, household budgets will feel the impact."
How we got here
China's trade practices have long been a source of frustration for American companies, which are not able to gain access to parts of China's market and are forced to hand over valuable technology and trade secrets to Chinese partners in exchange for operating there.
In June, the Trump administration said talks to change China's trade behavior -- which had spanned decades -- were going nowhere and announced duties on $50 billion worth of Chinese imports.
The first round was intended to minimize pain on American consumers: Chinese aircraft engine parts, bulldozers, ball bearings, motorcycles and industrial and agricultural machinery were among the products targeted initially.
China hit back with tariffs of its own on $50 billion of American products and focused on the agriculture sector -- punishing industries whose workers largely supported Mr. Trump.
Things have gone downhill from there. Mr. Trump said he would impose tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese products including consumer items, such as food, tools, housewares and some, but not all, electronics imports.
A new front in the war on Christmas
The initial effect of the new $200 billion round of tariffs will be felt just ahead of the holiday shopping season in the United States, when Americans will be looking to stock up on gifts. Higher prices for imported materials such as cotton, nylon, polyester and yarn means that clothing companies will have to pass additional costs onto consumers.
Then there are accessories. The tariffs will apply to imported purses, golf bags, ski gloves and mittens.
Retailers are not sure how fast the price increases will make their way to store shelves but they are bracing for the worst. Mr. French, of the retail federation, said many buyers are more likely to see big price effects next year than during the holidays.
Food could be an exception and consumers could start to see higher prices in the grocery aisles. A wide variety of fish, including sea bass and sturgeon, as well as nuts, fruit, vegetables, rice and cereal did not escape the Trump administration's tariffs.
The next wave will be worse
Mr. Trump isn't done punishing China and has threatened to tax another $267 billion worth of goods if China retaliates against the United States -- which would mean America taxes nearly everything that enters from China. On Tuesday, China said it would impose tariffs of its own on an additional $60 billion in American goods.
Businesses are bracing for an unending trade fight. They're not exactly sure how it will affect prices but they do not believe it will be helpful. "In some cases you're not going to see those costs absorbed and they're going to get passed on. In some cases, we're going to absorb it where we can," the chief executive of Macy's, Jeff Gennette, told CNBC this week. "We're going to see how the customer votes on this."
Walmart's chief financial officer, Brett Biggs, said last month that "While we know questions persist about tariffs, the potential future impact is difficult to quantify."
"We are closely monitoring the tariff discussions and are actively working on mitigation strategies, particularly in light of potentially escalating duties," he added.
The tariff list includes popular consumer items that line the aisles of department and big box stores, including bicycles, baseball gloves, sleeping bags and rain jackets.
The lobbying will continue
The steel and aluminum tariffs that Mr. Trump imposed earlier this year prompted a wave of lobbying from countries, trade groups and corporations that wanted their individual products exempted from the levies.
A similar exclusion process has been established for the China tariffs, with one key difference: If one company wins an exclusion to import, say, ski gloves, then any company that imports ski gloves receives the same exemption. To date, the administration has not ruled on any of those exclusion requests.
Some companies and industries have persuaded the administration to grant them at least temporary relief from tariffs, by leaving them off the $200 billion list. Apple's lobbying proved successful in the most recent round, as its watches and Bluetooth devices were removed from the preliminary tariff list.
Prices will increase, but inflation is likely to stay tame
Mr. Ross's best case on prices might be that, even if consumers notice them on individual products, the increases will not add up to runaway inflation.
Tariffs tend to increase consumer prices, but analysts say the increase in prices from Mr. Trump's tariffs is likely to be small, at least for now. Economists at TD Securities said in a research note Tuesday that they expected the tariffs to add 0.1 percentage points to the inflation rate over the next year. They added that countervailing consequences, like a stronger dollar, could easily offset the effect on prices.
Analysts also expect a small reduction in economic growth. Economists at JPMorgan Chase estimated economic output would fall by about 0.1 percentage points.

Full text: BEIJING -- President Trump imposed tariffs in July on $34 billion in Chinese goods. China matched them dollar for dollar with its own.
Then he hit an additional $16 billion in goods in August. China matched that, too.
Now, Mr. Trump has made his biggest move yet, announcing 10 percent tariffs starting in a week on $200 billion a year of Chinese goods. But this time, China can't match them all -- and that crystallizes a growing problem for Beijing.
On Tuesday, Chinese officials responded to the president's latest move by following through on an earlier threat to impose tariffs on $60 billion in American goods -- nearly everything China buys from the United States.
China's responses have so far failed to thwart Mr. Trump's trade offensive, and with the White House amping up the fight again, Chinese leaders aren't sure how to respond, people briefed on economic policymaking discussions say.
Chinese officials "are generally confused," said Raúl Hinojosa-Ojeda, a trade specialist at the University of California, Los Angeles, who has been traveling around China speaking with officials, businesspeople and workers.
"They don't know what to do," he added. "They worry that the tit-for-tat model is playing into Trump's hands."
China does not import nearly enough from the United States to target $200 billion in American goods -- let alone the additional $267 billion in Chinese goods that Mr. Trump has threatened to tax.
But China's leaders feel they cannot back down. They have presented the trade war as part of a broader effort by the United States to contain China's rise.
Mr. Trump has said as much, and did so again at a news conference on Tuesday. "China has been taking advantage of the United States for a long time, and that's not happening anymore," he said.
The Chinese public could see any effort to soothe tensions as capitulation. Some hard-liners want a more aggressive stance.
Lou Jiwei, who retired as finance minister in 2016 but is still the head of the country's social security fund, suggested on Sunday that China could deliberately disrupt American companies' supply chains by halting the export of crucial components mostly made in China. But Chinese trade experts dismiss that idea as impractical and not the government's position.
Chinese officials know what they don't want to do. They have rejected one idea that would replace the matching tariffs with a more sophisticated system, said the people briefed on the discussions, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the fragility of the deliberations. That response -- discussed in detail within the Commerce Ministry and other agencies -- would have led to lower tariffs on American goods in dollar terms, which could be seen as a fig leaf to the White House.
That approach would have recognized a potentially expensive new reality for Beijing: The tariffs may be here to stay. Mr. Trump is suffering from weak approval ratings and could lose influence in congressional elections in November. Democrats have opposed most of his agenda, but many have supported his attacks on trade with China. Even if Mr. Trump leaves office in two years, there is little guarantee that his China trade policies will be changed.
In Beijing, proponents of the new approach, which would scale down China's tariffs in dollar terms to reflect the lopsided trade imbalance between the two countries, say Chinese leaders could still revisit the idea because it offers them a way to contain the damage and soothe tensions.
China's leaders "don't really want to engage in a dollar-for-dollar retaliation," said Yu Yongding, a prominent economist at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. "Their purpose is to stop this trade war."
China's other options are limited.
It could punish American businesses that depend on China. Already, its antitrust officials have effectively killed the $44 billion effort by Qualcomm, the semiconductor company, to buy a Dutch chip maker. China has also pledged to buy soybeans from other countries, but replacing voluminous American supplies will be difficult.
Other moves have already served as warnings, like delays at Chinese ports. Ford Motor's Lincoln cars and other goods have sometimes been the subject of unusually lengthy customs inspections this summer, although the delays do not appear to have caused much financial harm.
"It is certain that China will have other, invisible retaliation against the United States," said Mei Xinyu, a researcher at the Commerce Ministry's policy research and training academy.
But more drastic moves, like closing factories or encouraging consumer boycotts of American goods, could eliminate Chinese jobs. They could also permanently damage China's reputation as a place to do business and only accelerate corporate plans to look to other countries.
"It's difficult to build a reputation, and easy to harm a reputation," Mr. Mei said.
China could also guide its currency to a weaker level against the dollar. It has already nudged the currency a bit lower, making Chinese goods cheaper in the United States and partly offsetting the tariffs. But a weaker currency would make China's imports more expensive, raise the risk of inflation and lead to a potentially damaging flight of money out of the country. It could also provoke further American retaliation.
The trade war has hit only a small part of the Chinese economy for now, but the damage could add up. Higher tariffs on American goods raise the cost of essential imports like soybeans and microchips. China still derives a big chunk of growth from making smartphones, clothing, chemicals and a raft of other goods and selling them to Americans.
Already its currency and stock market have weakened as the trade war has intensified. China has taken steps to shore up its economy, but they could take months or years to kick in.
China has offered small concessions to the United States, like lowering its tariffs on imported cars from everywhere to 15 percent, from 25 percent; the United States, however, charges 2.5 percent. China has also allowed foreign companies to own greater shares of Chinese insurers, banks, asset management companies and car factories.
The new plan that Chinese officials rejected in recent weeks could have been more warmly greeted by the White House.
Under that plan, the United States and China would each levy tariffs based on proportions of trade rather than dollar amounts, people familiar with the discussions said. Because the United States imports nearly four times as much from China as it exports, that would lead to tariffs at different values.
For example, the United States has already levied tariffs on $50 billion in Chinese goods, one-tenth of what it imports from China. Instead of matching that with tariffs on $50 billion in American-made goods, China would levy tariffs on one-tenth of such goods, totaling $13 billion to $15 billion, depending on the details.
Proponents of the plan say letting Washington impose more tariffs than Beijing would actually hurt the United States more because tariffs are ultimately paid by consumers and businesses in the countries that levy them.
"The United States wants to hurt China by imposing tariffs on Chinese exports," Mr. Yu, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences economist, wrote in a journal in July. "In the end, it may be the United States itself" that is hurt, he wrote.
But other Chinese trade experts say tariffs on equal fractions of trade would be too big a compromise.
"It's unrealistic, it's difficult in practice, it's not doable, and it's against basic trade rules," said Mr. Mei, the Commerce Ministry researcher.

Full text: A decade ago this week, Wall Street imploded. Read our special coverage .
______
It's hard to overstate how deeply Americans despised their government's response to the global financial crisis. It has helped shape the last decade of American politics, fueling distrust of powerful institutions and speeding a drift toward ideological extremes.
But for all that anger, the engineers of the American crisis response got the economics mostly correct, and more right than most of those -- including leading economic thinkers and prominent politicians -- who were second-guessing them.
I was a beat reporter covering the events at the time and the key players -- including the former Treasury secretaries Hank Paulson and Tim Geithner, and the former Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke -- and then wrote a book on the crisis. Looking back on it a decade later, I'm struck by the way that I, and they, misunderstood what "success" would actually mean.
The engineers of the response succeeded in their immediate goal, to preserve the financial system. But they -- or, more precisely, they and their political leaders at the time -- also left fissures that threaten to undermine the system they sought to preserve. The very underpinnings of modern capitalism are being questioned from all sides. A Republican administration has gleefully cast aside trade deals, for instance, and the energy among Democrats is around democratic socialism.
To understand the challenges and ultimately the failure of the politics of their response, it helps to put yourself back in 2008 and 2009, when the financial might of the United States government -- trillions of dollars, cumulatively -- was deployed to try to contain the crisis.
Rebuilding the status quo
Mr. Geithner, Mr. Paulson and Mr. Bernanke are centrists in the context of modern American politics, but they are conservatives in the traditional sense -- people trying to preserve a system they inherited.
Their strategy was to patch things up as quickly as possible. The goal was not to try to reinvent Wall Street on the fly, but to keep the flow of capital coursing through the global economy while minimizing the depth and duration of the recession that the crisis had caused.
Some 230 academic economists signed a letter attacking the bank bailout legislation that Mr. Paulson proposed as unfair and a potential threat to the vibrancy of private markets.
Mr. Geithner's disinclination to nationalize banks drew fierce criticism from liberals who argued that the government was essentially funneling money to banks with little assurance they would resume lending.
"Whatever its merits, his bailout plan offers generous subsidies to banks and private investors while protecting bank management and creditors," John B. Judis wrote in 2009 in a New Republic article titled "The Geithner Disaster."
Mr. Bernanke's efforts to pump money into the economy by buying up bonds also met opposition. A group of conservative economists wrote a letter in 2010 arguing that the Fed's plans to engage in quantitative easing "risk currency debasement and inflation, and we do not think they will achieve the Fed's objective of promoting employment."
These attacks were misguided.
Mr. Paulson's financial rescue package did not herald an era of socialism on Wall Street; nor did it come at a huge continuing cost to taxpayers. By many measures, it made money.
Mr. Geithner's stress tests achieved their goal of restoring confidence in major banks without the cost and political damage of nationalizing them. They were successful enough that similar stress tests are now a part of regulators' tool kits both in the United States and overseas.
Mr. Bernanke's aggressive monetary policy probably played a role in getting the expansion on track starting in mid-2009. Quantitative easing and low interest rates did not cause a collapse of the dollar or spiraling inflation.
Nobody would argue that the United States economy is perfect, or that the policymakers got everything exactly right.
If Mr. Paulson had secured financial rescue legislation before Lehman Brothers went bankrupt, perhaps the most severe phase of the crisis could have been avoided altogether, though it is a puzzle how he could have gotten the votes for such a plan before the crisis became more severe. If Mr. Bernanke had moved faster -- putting an open-ended quantitative easing program in place in 2009 or 2010 instead of waiting till 2012 -- maybe full recovery would have come sooner.
It's not clear how the recovery might have looked had Mr. Geithner embraced a more activist approach to replacing management and taking greater government control of the most troubled large banks, notably Citigroup and Bank of America. Or if he had welcomed a larger program to help relieve borrowers who were underwater on their homes.
The tactics the men chose can be second-guessed, but the result of their efforts speaks for itself. The expansion has lasted nine years, the second longest on record. Although job gains were disappointingly slow for years, the unemployment rate is now 3.9 percent, among the lowest in decades.
From 2007 to 2017, per-person inflation-adjusted G.D.P. rose 6.3 percent in the United States, compared with only 3 percent in the eurozone, where similar policies were embraced more slowly.
In exhaustive research of the history of financial crises, the economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff found that it takes eight years on average for a society to return to its level of per-person income. The United States did so in 2013, only six years after the peak of the crisis.
The political price
It was Feb. 19, 2009, less than a month into the Obama administration. Mr. Geithner and his colleagues had introduced plans to assist struggling homeowners, which many liberal critics considered deeply inadequate.
The human cost of the foreclosure crisis was indeed immense; there were 2.8 million foreclosures that year alone. But the politics of helping troubled homeowners were more toxic than the crisis managers had foreseen.
From the floor of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the CNBC broadcaster Rick Santelli began a rant for the ages. "How many of you people want to pay for your neighbor's mortgage that has an extra bathroom and can't pay their bills?" Mr. Santelli said, as traders cheered behind him. "President Obama, are you listening?"
"We're thinking about having a Chicago tea party in July," he continued.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The term stuck, and was embraced by the conservative activists who propelled Republicans to victory in the 2010 midterm elections -- driven, in no small part, by opposition to economic stimulus, financial bailouts and the work of the Federal Reserve.
The policymakers knew history's warnings about economic policy that reacts too sluggishly to financial crisis.
Mr. Geithner spent some evenings in the darkest days reading in Liaquat Ahamed's "Lords of Finance" about how an earlier generation of policymakers bungled the response to the Great Depression. Mr. Bernanke is a scholar of that era in his own right.
But they seemed to assume that if they got the economics right, popular support would follow. As Mr. Bernanke wrote in his memoir about the Santelli rant, "I remained perplexed that helping homeowners was not more politically popular."
There's a reason, of course, that they were in their roles as appointed technocrats and not politicians. But it isn't clear that George W. Bush or Barack Obama had any better ideas for bringing along the public than did the men they chose to lead financial policy. The crisis response may well have been a Rubik's Cube of political and economic challenges too complicated to solve.
It was foreseeable, perhaps, that many on the left would view the Geithner-Paulson-Bernanke strategy as too friendly to Wall Street interests. It was also foreseeable that the libertarian right would loathe the bailouts. More surprising were the ways in which some of the biggest beneficiaries of the strategy became vocal opponents.
The Geithner strategy was based on rescuing Wall Street, using hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars -- while building a more rigorous regulatory system to try to prevent a similar crisis.
But by the time what became the Dodd-Frank Act was on its way to passage in 2010, the financial industry and nearly all Republicans in Congress had committed to all-out opposition of industry regulation. Only three of 178 Republican House members, for example, supported the bill.
Even as Mr. Bernanke's easy money policies pushed the stock market upward and coincided with a gradually improving economy and low inflation, the drumbeat of commentary was overwhelmingly negative.
You could turn on a financial network at nearly any hour of the trading day and hear complaints about how quantitative easing and zero interest rates were distorting markets. When Mr. Bernanke left office in early 2014, when the stock market was soaring and the unemployment rate was falling fast, only 28 percent of Republicans approved of his performance, according to a Gallup survey.
Success has rarely been so unpopular.
How the crisis broke our politics
In July, Mr. Bernanke, Mr. Geithner and Mr. Paulson were together again. They invited a handful of reporters to interview them in a conference room at the Brookings Institution, where they will be participating in a crisis retrospective in September.
Might the rise of anti-establishment parties around the world -- not least Donald J. Trump on the right and Bernie Sanders-esque socialists on the left in the United States -- be traced to their work as crisis responders?
"We know from history that financial crises, particularly big ones, do tend to get followed by a populist reaction," Mr. Bernanke said. "I think we all tried our best to explain what we were doing and work with the politics, as difficult as it was. I think back to the crisis, we were very focused on preventing the collapse of the financial system. And developing our communication to the broad public wasn't always our first priority."
He argued, though, that longer-term trends -- like stagnation in middle-class wages, social dysfunctions, rising mistrust in government and hostility to immigration -- were a bigger explanation for the rise in a politics of extremes.
This analysis seems both correct and incomplete. Of course, the embrace of anti-immigrant nationalism on the right and of socialism on the left have roots considerably deeper than a bank bailout or a quantitative easing program.
But it was the experience of the crisis, and the sense among Americans of all ideological dispositions that they were being asked to foot the bill for someone else's mistakes -- whether by Wall Street C.E.O.s or by Mr. Santelli's neighbor with the renovated bathroom -- that helped make those long-simmering problems boil over.
The response to the crisis was in many ways the high-water mark for a mold of centrist, technocratic policymaking that seeks to tweak and nudge existing institutions toward better outcomes. It also undermined any widespread popular support for that mode of governing for the foreseeable future.
It turns out, when you throw trillions of dollars at rescuing a system that most people don't like very much in the first place, the result isn't relief.
It's anger.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text: Ten years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the official economic statistics -- the ones that fill news stories, television shows and presidential tweets -- say that the American economy is fully recovered.
The unemployment rate is lower than it was before the financial crisis began. The stock market has soared. The total combined output of the American economy, also known as gross domestic product, has risen 20 percent since Lehman collapsed. The crisis is over.
But, of course, it isn't over. The financial crisis remains the most influential event of the 21st century. It left millions of people -- many of whom were already anxious about the economy -- feeling much more anxious, if not downright angry. Their frustration has helped create a threat to Western liberal democracy that would have been hard to imagine a decade ago. Far-right political parties are on the rise across Europe, and Britain is leaving the European Union. The United States elected a racist reality-television star who has thrown the presidency into chaos.
Look around, and you can see the lingering effects of the financial crisis just about everywhere -- everywhere, that is, except in the most commonly cited economic statistics. So who are you going to believe: those statistics, or your own eyes?

Over the course of history, financial crises -- and the long downturns that follow -- have reordered American society in all sorts of ways. One of those ways happens to involve the statistics that the government collects. Crises have often highlighted the need for new measures of human well-being.
The unemployment rate was invented in the 1870s in response to concerns about mass joblessness after the Panic of 1873. The government's measure of national output, now called G.D.P., began during the Great Depression. Senator Robert La Follette, the progressive hero from Wisconsin, introduced the resolution that later led to the measurement of G.D.P., and the great economist Simon Kuznets, later a Nobel laureate, oversaw the first version.
Almost a century later, it is time for a new set of statistics. It's time for measures that do a better job of capturing the realities of modern American life.
As a technical matter, the current batch of official numbers are perfectly accurate. They also describe some real and important aspects of the American economy. The trouble is that a handful of statistics dominate the public conversation about the economy despite the fact that they provide a misleading portrait of people's lives. Even worse, the statistics have become more misleading over time.
The main reason is inequality. A small, affluent segment of the population receives a large and growing share of the economy's bounty. It was true before Lehman Brothers collapsed on Sept. 15, 2008, and it has become even more so since. As a result, statistics that sound as if they describe the broad American economy -- like G.D.P. and the Dow Jones industrial average -- end up mostly describing the experiences of the affluent.
The stock market, for example, has completely recovered from the financial crisis, and then some. Stocks are now worth almost 60 percent more than when the crisis began in 2007, according to a inflation-adjusted measure from Moody's Analytics. But wealthy households own the bulk of stocks. Most Americans are much more dependent on their houses. That's why the net worth of the median household is still about 20 percent lower than it was in early 2007. When television commentators drone on about the Dow, they're not talking about a good measure of most people's wealth.
The unemployment rate has also become less meaningful than it once was. In recent decades, the number of idle working-age adults has surged. They are not working, not looking for work, not going to school and not taking care of children. Many of them would like to work, but they can't find a decent-paying job and have given up looking. They are not counted in the official unemployment rate.
All the while, the federal government and much of the news media continue to act as if the same economic measures that made sense decades ago still make sense today. Habit comes before accuracy.
Fortunately, there is a nascent movement to change that. A team of academic economists -- Gabriel Zucman, Emmanuel Saez and Thomas Piketty (the best-selling author on inequality) -- has begun publishing a version of G.D.P. that separates out the share of national income flowing to rich, middle class and poor. For now, its data is published with a lag; the most recent available year is 2014. But the work is starting to receive attention from other academics and policy experts.
In the Senate, two Democratic senators, including Chuck Schumer, the party leader, have introduced a bill that would direct the federal government to publish a version of the same data series. Heather Boushey, who runs the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, told me that it could be the most important change in economic data collection in decades.
And there is no reason that data reform needs to be limited to G.D.P. The Labor Department could change the monthly jobs report to give more attention to other unemployment numbers. It could also provide more data on wages, rather than only broad averages. The Federal Reserve, for its part, could publish quarterly estimates of household wealth by economic class.
These changes may sound technocratic. They are technocratic. But they can still be important. Over time, they can subtly shift the way that the country talks about the economy.
"As someone who advises policymakers, I can tell you there is often this shock: 'The economy is growing. Why aren't people feeling it,"' Boushey says. "The answer is: Because they literally aren't feeling it." She argues -- rightly, I think -- that the government should not focus on creating wholly new statistics. It should instead change and expand the ones that are already followed closely. Doing so could force the media and policymakers to talk about economic well-being at the same time that they are talking about economic indicators.
It's worth remembering that the current indicators are not a naturally occurring phenomenon. They are political creations, with the flaws, limitations and choices that politics usually involves.
Take the unemployment rate. It dates to 1878, when a former Civil War officer and Massachusetts politician named Carroll D. Wright was running the state's Bureau of the Statistics of Labor. Wright thought that the public had an exaggerated sense of the extent of unemployment after the Panic of 1873. He called it "industrial hypochondria."
So Wright asked town assessors and police officers to count the number of people in their area who were out of work. But he added a caveat that he knew would hold down the number, as Alexander Keyssar, a Harvard historian, has written. Wright wanted the count to include only adult men who "really want employment." He specifically called for the exclusion of the many men who had effectively given up searching for work because they didn't think that they could find a job that paid as much as their previous job. Not surprisingly, Wright's count produced a modest number that, he happily announced, had proved the "croakers" wrong.
Several years later, he received a promotion. He was named the first head of the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, a job he would hold for 20 years. His original methods from Massachusetts influenced the way that the federal government began calculating unemployment data, and still do to this day. The fact that the official rate ignores millions of discouraged workers is -- although Wright wouldn't have used this phrase -- a feature not a bug.
There is no mystery about what a better set of indicators would look like. For the most part, the indicators already exist. They tend to be obscure, however. Some are calculated only once a year or less frequently. Others appear monthly or quarterly, but the media and politicians tend to ignore them. These numbers include: the overall share of working-age adults who are actually working; pay at different points on the income distribution; and the same sort of distribution for net worth (which includes stock holdings, home values and other assets and debts).
The whole point of statistics is to describe reality. When a statistic no longer does so, it's time to find a new one -- not to come up with a convoluted rationale that tries to twist reality to fit the statistic.
The notion that our most prominent economic indicators are problematic has been around for a long time. Kuznets himself, the economist who invented G.D.P. as we know it, cautioned people not to confuse it with "economic welfare." Most famously, Robert F. Kennedy liked to say during his 1968 presidential campaign that G.D.P. measured everything "except that which makes life worthwhile."
After all these years, though, we haven't solved the problem. Maybe it takes a financial crisis to do so.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- For years, Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple have fought regulators in Europe on privacy, antitrust and taxes. In the United States, the tech titans were on friendly terrain.
But on Thursday, the Federal Trade Commission kicked off a series of hearings to discuss whether the agency's competition and consumer protection policies should change to better reflect new technologies and companies.
Joseph J. Simons, the agency's chairman, expressed openness to a new approach.
"The broad antitrust consensus that has existed within the antitrust community, in relatively stable form for the last 25 years, is being challenged," Mr. Simons said. "I approach all these issues with a very open mind, very much willing to be influenced by what we see and hear at these hearings."
The F.T.C. hearings, the first of 15 to 20 over the next several months, are one of several efforts underway on the federal and state level that threaten to limit the expansion and power of tech companies. Later this month, Congress will bring executives from top tech companies to testify on proposals for privacy laws. The Justice Department has warned it may start investigations into whether Google and other social media sites are biased against conservative voices.
The spotlight on the giants of Silicon Valley is a major shift for regulators in the United States. For years, they held up the growth of these firms as an emblem of American business leadership and ingenuity. But after a string of crises over privacy and misinformation on social media, a growing chorus of regulators from both political parties is casting a more skeptical eye on the industry.
New regulations in the United States are unlikely to arrive anytime soon, and any new federal policies will probably be weaker than those in Europe and states like California. Tech companies have lobbied the Trump administration for voluntary rules and government officials have indicated their desire for light-touch regulation that would pre-empt some state laws.
"It will be a slow-moving ship, faster on privacy than on antitrust, but it's an important moment," said Blair Levin, a senior adviser at the research firm New Street and a former chief of staff at the Federal Communications Commission.
Reaching an agreement on changes to antitrust policy will be particularly difficult.
The field of antitrust law has focused for 30 years on whether prices increase when there is limited competition. Some academics and consumer groups have called for regulators to rethink that gauge. Amazon and Google, they say, defy that metric of antitrust law because the companies are gaining power even as they offer cheap or free goods.
One proponent of this change of thinking, Lina Khan, is an assistant to a Democratic commissioner at the F.T.C. Her focus on Amazon has been buoyed by Senator Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent, who has criticized the company and its chief executive, Jeff Bezos, for contributing to income inequality.
"The issue about Amazon is not just that the wealthiest person on earth, Jeff Bezos, is paying workers unlivable wages. It's about the 'new economy' and the degradation of the human spirit -- breaking down people, spitting them out and simply replacing them with new bodies," Mr. Sanders said last week in a Twitter post.
Amazon has disputed Mr. Sanders's accusations, saying the company offers stable pay and benefits for its employees. It has also disputed concerns the company has violated antitrust laws, saying it does not have a dominant market share of the retail market.
Some Republicans have also voiced concerns about the industry, and a growing number of economists are studying whether technology's leading companies are increasing wage inequality. The economists are focused on whether the concentration of workforces at companies like Amazon have a disproportionate effect on wages, inflation and growth.
"These concerns raise a challenge to antitrust agency leadership, the courts and legislators," Mr. Simons said on Thursday.
Companies have argued against broad changes. Google, for instance, says that it offers free search services and that consumers can easily switch to rival search engines online. Companies argue that the tech market is fast changing and regulations could quickly become outdated.
The F.T.C. hearing, held at the Georgetown University School of Law, was filled with antitrust lawyers, some of whom had ties to the tech companies. Many warned that changes could make decisions on mergers and antitrust enforcement vulnerable to politics.
Janet L. McDavid, a panelist at the F.T.C. hearing and a lawyer at Hogan Lovells, said simply going after companies because they were big was dangerous.
The "amorphous" concepts of big and fair in antitrust law could lend itself to political decisions, Ms. McDavid said.
"Which we certainly should eschew, especially now in the current political environment," she said.

Full text: Stocks in the United States made solid gains Thursday as Apple and Qualcomm led a rally in technology companies. Drugmakers and health insurers also rose.
Apple changed course and rose a day after it introduced three new iPhone models and updates to the Apple Watch. Chipmakers recovered after a steep drop the day before.
Technology stocks are edging higher after a four-day losing streak last week, their longest since April, though investors worry about the prospect of heavier regulation for companies like Facebook, Twitter and Alphabet.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 15.26 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,904.18. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 147.07 points, or 0.6 percent, to 26,145.99. The Nasdaq composite jumped 59.48 points, or 0.7 percent, to 8,013.71.
Apple climbed 2.4 percent to $226.41 and Qualcomm rose 4 percent to $74.61 after it announced a $16 billion stock repurchase. Other chipmakers including Skyworks and Broadcom also rose.
Insurance companies reversed their recent loses, and home improvement retailers slipped as Hurricane Florence weakened somewhat. The slow-moving storm is expected to reach the East Coast Friday and might remain around the Carolinas for days, but investors figure that it will not do as much damage as previously estimated, and property insurers will not have to pay out as much.
RenaissanceRe jumped 2.7 percent to $130.95 and Everest Re climbed 3.1 percent to $220.69.
Supermarket company Kroger dropped 9.9 percent to $28.58 after its sales fell short of Wall Street forecasts.
The Department of Labor said its index of consumer prices edged up 0.2 percent in August, and it has risen 2.7 percent over the past year. That is a bit slower than the 2.9 percent it reported in July. Investors have worried that faster inflation could threaten economic growth and the current bull market.
Cable channel operator Discovery rose another 4.7 percent to $31.84. The stock jumped 7.7 percent Wednesday after the company announced a deal that will make more of its programming available on the streaming service Hulu.
Acorda Therapeutics fell 2.4 percent to $18.05 after announcing the Food and Drug Administration will take three more months to review its inhaled Parkinson's disease treatment Inbrija.
Benchmark United States crude slid 2.5 percent to $68.59 a barrel in New York. It rose 4.3 percent over the previous two days.
Bond prices ticked lower. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.97 percent from 2.96 percent.
The dollar rose to 111.88 yen from 111.22 yen. The euro rose to $1.1692 from $1.1632.
Gold fell 0.2 percent to $1,208.20 an ounce.
Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 added 1 percent and the South Korean Kospi rose 0.1 percent.

Turkish Bank Raises Rates, Defying Erdogan

Full text: Acting to stem a currency crisis that has rattled markets worldwide, Turkey's central bank sharply raised interest rates on Thursday, defying a call by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan just hours earlier to lower borrowing costs.

The move, increasing Turkey's benchmark interest rate to 24 percent from 17.75 percent, quickly pushed the Turkish lira up 3 percent against the dollar. The currency had dropped to record lows in August on investor concern that inflation was accelerating and that Mr. Erdogan was taking too active a role in the management of the economy.
The plunge in the lira -- the currency has fallen nearly 40 percent against the dollar since the start of the year -- was exacerbated by a series of diplomatic and trade disputes with the United States. The tumultuous period has served to expose the flaws in Turkey's debt-fueled economic growth.
Authorities "are trying to grab back the initiative," said Peter Dixon, an economist at Commerzbank. "Whether they'll succeed or not is another matter."
[Learn more about why investors are pulling out of emerging markets.]
Turkey's recent economic problems have been so stark that only drastic measures could stabilize the lira and reverse an eye-popping 18 percent surge in inflation, economists said. But Mr. Erdogan, who is widely seen as trying to influence the independent central bank, has signaled an unwillingness to allow even modest rate increases or curb government spending that has fueled a popular growth boom -- as well as runaway prices.
Hours before the central bank made its announcement, Mr. Erdogan said he valued the bank's independence, before immediately taking another swipe at it. Speaking to the Confederation of Turkish Tradesmen in Ankara, he slammed interest rates as a "tool of exploitation," adding: "I say, let's drop these high interest rates. Interest is the cause, inflation is the result."
Mr. Erdogan also signed a decree Thursday effectively imposing a ban on conducting business in Turkey using euros or dollars.
That made the decision to jack up interest rates even more of a surprise. Analysts said the move may at last help stabilize the lira and put a brake on inflation, while restoring the faith of investors in the central bank's independence. But it could also set the bank up for a clash with Mr. Erdogan if higher borrowing costs begin to cool the rapid economic growth that he has sought to bolster his popular support.

In a statement announcing its move, the Turkish central bank said there were "upside risks" to inflation, despite "weaker domestic demand conditions." It added that, as a result, it had "decided to implement a strong monetary tightening to support price stability."
For nearly two decades, Turkey had uninterrupted growth that helped reduce poverty, increase the ranks of the middle class and, until recently, turned the nation into a darling of international investors.
But the growth was built chiefly on a construction boom fed by cheap credit and an avalanche of government spending that Mr. Erdogan poured into the economy to stimulate even more activity. That success story has become increasingly unsustainable.
On the ground, the plunge in the lira has had an impact on daily life in a litany of ways, affecting even the availability of pharmaceutical supplies. Major drug wholesalers in Turkey are running low on stocks, and soon many antibiotics, as well as drugs for oncology, as well as cardiovascular and neurological ailments, will fall out of date, according to Vedat Bulut, the president of the Ankara Chamber of Pharmacists.
"Hundreds of thousands of people will be affected," Mr. Bulut said. "Especially for cancer patients, a delay of even a few days in treatment may cause metastasis."
The lira's dizzying ups and downs have mirrored many of the challenges faced by emerging market currencies. As the Federal Reserve has begun increasing interest rates in the United States and as the European Central Bank looks to withdraw monetary stimulus of its own, investors have become less tolerant of the risks present in many smaller developing countries, and have begun pulling their cash. The South African rand has lost almost a fifth of its value since the start of the year, while the Indonesian rupiah has declined nearly 10 percent and the Indian rupee 13 percent in the same period.
The lira has since recovered many of its losses. At its weakest, in mid-August, 7.2 lira were required to buy one dollar, but at one point on Thursday the Turkish currency had strengthened to 6 against the dollar.
While Turkey remains a relatively minor economy in the global context -- its annual output is about the same as that of a country like the Netherlands -- several European banks have investments or subsidiaries there. That exposes the region to risks emanating from Turkey, even as the European Union grapples with its own challenges, including a trade dispute with the United States and concerns over slowing economic growth.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The income of the median American household has finally rebounded from the damage caused by the 2008 financial crisis, a significant milestone in the nation's painfully slow economic recovery.
Median household income reached $61,372 in 2017, the Census Bureau reported on Wednesday, a number that it said was statistically indistinguishable from the median on the cusp of the crisis, in 2007.
The Trump administration, in a statement released by the White House Council of Economic Advisers, hailed the report as an indication of a strengthening American economy. "The effects of the strong economy are reaching Americans throughout the United States," the statement said, adding, "The news is actually better than these numbers suggest."
But the details of the report raised questions about whether middle-class households -- which have experienced an economic "lost decade" -- are now likely to see actual income gains or if they will simply tread water. One reason for concern is that income growth slowed in 2017, to 1.8 percent. Median income had grown more rapidly in previous years, by 5.2 percent in 2015 and 3.2 percent in 2016.
The gains in income were also driven by increased employment, rather than increased pay. The average annual earnings of both male and female full-time workers actually declined last year, but that drop was offset in the national data by the increase in the number of people with jobs.
"We have tight labor markets but not tight enough to generate a break from the trend -- to spur meaningful wage growth," said Heidi Shierholz, an economist at the liberal Economic Policy Institute.
The report provides ample fodder for both political parties in the run-up to the midterm elections in November. Congressional Republicans, saddled with an unpopular president, are eager to take credit for economic gains, rallying behind the slogan that Americans are "better off now." Representative Ted Budd, Republican of North Carolina, described the report as "huge news for the middle class."
But Democrats argue that the benefits of growth are mostly being pocketed by the wealthy. Economic output, adjusted for inflation, increased by 16 percent between 2007 and 2017, while median income remained unchanged. The median is the midpoint of the income distribution, meaning that an equal number of households made more and less than that figure.
Jared Bernstein, an economist at the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities who served as the chief economist to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., said the numbers showed "a structural gap between overall economic growth and the prosperity of many families."
While middle-class incomes are treading water, the rich have prospered and the poor have fallen behind. Between 2007 and 2017, household income at the 90th percentile rose by 7.5 percent, according to the Census Bureau, while at the 10th percentile it fell by 4.5 percent.
The Trump administration declared in July that the federal government's long-running effort to reduce poverty "is largely over and a success." The Census Bureau, by contrast, reported that 12.3 percent of Americans lived in poverty in 2017 -- about 39.7 million people.
That was an improvement over 2016, when the poverty rate stood at 12.7 percent.
There are also large differences by race. The median income of African-American households in 2017 remained 2.9 percent lower than in 2007, according to the Economic Policy Institute, while the median for white households rose by 1.5 percent over the same period. For Hispanics, the median rose by 6.7 percent.
The Census Bureau made significant changes in its methodology in 2013, complicating comparisons with earlier years. The reported level of median household income in 2017 was the highest on record, but officials said the changes in methodology tended to increase reported income. Adjusting for those changes, median household income was comparable to the level in 2007, and slightly below 1999.
The government publishes more than one measure of household income, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. The Congressional Budget Office, for example, publishes a measure including the value of the earned-income tax credit and noncash benefits like food stamps. By that measure, median household income surpassed the 2007 level in 2014 -- and was significantly higher than in 1999.
The Census Bureau also reported on Wednesday that the share of Americans with health insurance did not increase in 2017, breaking a trend of steady increases dating back to 2010.
The report said that 28.5 million people, or 8.8 percent of the population, lacked health insurance for all of 2017. The change from 2016 was not statistically significant for either number.
The stagnation was striking because of the increase in the share of Americans with full-time jobs. Such an increase would ordinarily be expected to produce a rise in health insurance coverage rates. Robert Greenstein, the president of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said the likely explanation was the Trump administration's efforts to undermine the Affordable Care Act. Otherwise, he said, "we probably would have seen further progress in 2017."
Turmoil in health insurance markets as Congress considered proposals to repeal the Affordable Care Act may have also created uncertainty. "Between 2016 and 2017, we saw that the uninsured rate decreased in three states, and it increased in 14 states," said Edward Berchick, a demographer at the Census Bureau. "This was the first time since 2013 that we saw an increase in any state."
The effect of opposition to the Affordable Care Act, passed by Democrats during the Obama administration, is most clearly visible in states that declined to expand Medicaid.
In states that did not expand Medicaid, 16.7 percent of the population had no health insurance coverage at any time during 2017, up from 16.1 percent in 2016. By contrast, in states that chose to expand Medicaid, there was no significant decrease in coverage. The Census Bureau said 9.4 percent of people age 19 to 64 had no health insurance coverage, roughly the same as last year.
The states with the highest proportion of uninsured residents were Texas (17.3 percent) and Oklahoma (14.2 percent), followed by Alaska, Georgia, Florida and Wyoming, all with more than 12 percent of their residents lacking coverage. Massachusetts, which has been working systematically to expand coverage for more than a decade, had the lowest uninsured rate last year, with 2.8 percent of residents uninsured. Five other states -- Hawaii, Iowa, Minnesota, Rhode Island and Vermont -- as well as the District of Columbia had uninsured rates of less than 5 percent.
In both expansion states and non-expansion states, the uninsured rate for working-age adults has declined significantly over the last decade. Most of the decline has taken place since 2013, as provisions of the Affordable Care Act expanding coverage took effect in 2014.
Larry Levitt, a senior vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, said the new census data suggested that "the historic progress in reducing the number of people uninsured has stalled."

Effect of Climate Change? Forecast Models? The 'Cone of Uncertainty'?

Full text: As Hurricane Florence approaches, we've received many questions from readers about the science of forecasting hurricanes, and how climate change affects them. Here are some answers.
How should we evaluate the different forecast models?
There are at least 20 computer forecasting models out there, though only five of them are considered accurate by most meteorologists. And for a hurricane like this one, you only need to concern yourself with one: the official model released by the National Hurricane Center. Most local weather services will be taking the center's lead.
The hurricane center combines the data from the top five models to create its official forecast. Researchers weight the consensus forecast in favor of the models that have performed better (the ones that have recently predicted real-world outcomes).
[Want climate news in your inbox? Sign up here for Climate Fwd: , our email newsletter.]
In recent years, the so-called European model, developed at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts in Reading, England, has gained a reputation as the best. But for Hurricane Florence, the American model, which is officially called the Global Forecast System and is run by the National Weather Service, has been outperforming the European model, said Jeff Masters, director of meteorology at the forecasting service Weather Underground.
Companies like Weather Underground make their own forecasts for routine weather, but for hurricanes they go with what the hurricane center says. The center doesn't provide forecasts beyond five days, however, so anything you're seeing in the five-to-10-day window is based on weather companies' own modeling and projections.
Why is Florence's path so unpredictable? Why is the 'cone of uncertainty' so large?
The cone of uncertainty, formally called the National Hurricane Center Track Forecast Cone, shows the area where the center of the storm is likely to go. The eye of the hurricane stays within the cone about two-thirds of the time, though people outside the cone can still experience catastrophic winds, floods and storm surges.
The cone may seem frustratingly wide for people in the path of the storm trying to make what could be life-or-death decisions. But the cone has actually shrunk in recent years, according to Dennis Feltgen, a meteorologist and spokesman for the National Hurricane Center. The cone shrinks as our ability to predict the weather improves. It's still large because predicting weather is hard in general and predicting hurricanes is even harder.
We've gotten so used to weather predictions being timely and accurate that we forget that weather forecasts that are more right than wrong are a recent phenomenon.
Mr. Feltgen and his colleagues want the public to know that the cone is just the best prediction of where the center of the hurricane will track. "It has nothing to do with the impacts of the hurricane," he said.
Will Hurricane Florence be worse than Hurricane Andrew?
It's hard to tell ahead of time whether one storm will be worse than another, because how bad a storm is really depends on the human impacts. To that point, many experts avoid using the term "natural disaster." They say that a disaster is what happens when a natural hazard -- hurricane, tornado, blizzard -- overlaps with a human population. Absent that, it's just weather.
It also depends on what you mean by worse. Hurricane Andrew was a memorable storm and one of the most costly on record when it hit Florida in 1992. But according to data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, in recent years it's fallen to sixth place in the United States by that measure, as Hurricanes Katrina, Harvey, Maria, Sandy and Irma have supplanted it when adjusted for inflation. Part of that is because more Americans are now living in the path of storms, and part of that is because climate change has played a role in making the effects of storms more severe.
As for fatalities, the deadliest storm on record in the United States happened in 1900, when surging waters killed more than 6,000 people in Galveston, Tex. This was before modern weather forecasting, however, and many people failed to evacuate the area.
How is climate change influencing Hurricane Florence and hurricanes more generally?
NOAA says to think of warm water as the engine that fuels hurricanes. They only form in ocean waters that are at least 80 degrees Fahrenheit (27 degrees Celsius) to a depth of at least 165 feet, which is why the most intense Atlantic hurricanes tend to happen in late summer and early fall after the ocean has had a summer to warm up.
Because of climate change, the world's oceans are warmer. Though climate change did not necessarily create Hurricane Harvey last year or Hurricane Florence this month, both of them were fueled by warmer than average waters.
Climate change can also make hurricanes wetter. Air temperatures are warmer, and basic physics tells us that warmer air can hold more moisture, which can translate into more rainfall.
To further exacerbate things, our warming climate seems to be causing hurricanes to stall, or linger longer in place. That's what happened with Hurricane Harvey, which meandered back out to the Gulf of Mexico after making its first landfall in Texas, and then back in. When a hurricane sticks around, even more rain can fall over a single area, leading to catastrophic flooding. Of the 50 inches of rain that fell over some parts of Houston because of Harvey, 38 percent, according to one study, was attributable to climate change.
Though Hurricane Florence's circular wind speeds are high, it, too, is predicted to move slowly across the Carolinas.
Finally, climate change also makes sea levels higher, thanks to a mix of thermal expansion (warmer water takes up more space than cold water) and melting glaciers. Higher sea levels make storm surges worse, another fear along the Carolina coast.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- They've testified, tweeted, written and called with their concerns. Now American businesses, which have so far been unable to stop President Trump from imposing sweeping tariffs, are mounting a last-ditch effort to convince the president that his trade policies are hurting his political base.
In a multimillion-dollar campaign that includes television advertisements, rallies in targeted congressional districts and online persuasion efforts, companies and business groups led by the National Retail Federation and an agricultural group called Farmers for Free Trade are highlighting the damage the tariffs are bringing to companies and workers in states with large numbers of Trump supporters.
The effort, called Tariffs Hurt the Heartland, focuses heavily on the economic pain that manufacturers say is being inflicted upon industries that Mr. Trump champions and patches of the country that lifted him to the White House. It includes nearly 90 industry trade groups, like the Consumer Technology Association, the National Lumber and Building Material Dealers Association and the Toy Association.
"We're obviously trying to reach the White House," said David French, the retail federation's senior vice president for government relations, "and we're trying to deliver a narrative to the White House that is clear and unambiguous, about the breadth of communities where the consequences of these tariffs will be felt."
But to persuade the president, companies must first win over the public -- in particular, Mr. Trump's most loyal supporters, who continue to back his trade policies by a wide margin. Eighty percent of Republicans support the steel and aluminum tariffs that Mr. Trump put in place this year, according to a survey conducted in early September for The New York Times by the online polling firm SurveyMonkey. Seventy-one percent of Republicans said Mr. Trump's overall trade policies make them more likely to support a Republican candidate in the midterm elections in November.
That tension between business groups -- which have cheered Republicans over tax cuts and efforts to reduce federal regulation -- and Mr. Trump's political base has proved difficult for many Republican members of Congress to navigate. Though many have spoken out against some or all of the president's tariffs, the Republican-held House and Senate have taken few concrete steps to push back against his policies.
The most vocal opponents have been businesses, which have found their entreaties repeatedly rebuffed by a president who has continued to threaten an escalating series of tariffs on goods from China, Canada and the European Union.
Apple, Ford and General Motors, along with hundreds of smaller businesses, have all publicly warned Mr. Trump that his tariffs will hurt the very companies he wants to protect, at the expense of American jobs and economic growth.
Mr. Trump's answer: Make your stuff in the United States.
Mr. Trump has already imposed tariffs on imported steel and aluminum from several countries, and on $50 billion worth of goods from China, a country his administration says is violating the norms of international trade. The president appears set to complete a second round of tariffs on China, on as much as $200 billion in imports, and he has said he is willing to move quickly to a third round that would encompass all Chinese imports -- including many everyday household items like apparel, electronics and other consumer products. And he has continued to threaten tariffs on cars imported from the European Union and Canada.
That has raised the stakes for American businesses, which face higher costs to source material and products from abroad and retaliation from other nations that has made it harder to sell into foreign markets.
Business owners have found sympathetic ears among lawmakers and the White House, but little action, prompting a more coordinated effort to try to show how tariffs hurt American consumers and businesses by raising prices.
"Our objective is to talk about that point," said Brian Dodge, a senior executive vice president at the Retail Industry Leaders Association, "and make sure that there is no one left with the impression that tariffs are something that other countries pay."
The coalition includes small business owners like Vivian R. Sayward, who owns Vivacity Sportswear, an athleisure maker in conservative San Diego, and who has been frustrated by congressional inaction. On a recent visit to Capitol Hill, Ms. Sayward wore clothing made in the United States by her company but stitched with Dryflex fabric imported from China. She used her outfit as a teaching tool, telling lawmakers and staff members where each thread and zipper came from, and warning how a new wave of tariffs on imported goods would make the clothes much more expensive.
The reaction to her visit from members of Congress and their aides, Ms. Sayward says, was, "We hear you, we understand, but we can't do anything just yet."
"That was frustrating, of course," she said. "It's easy to say that from Washington. But we're on the ground."
Tiffany Zarfas Williams, a third-generation owner of the Luggage Shop of Lubbock, in Texas, said she also found a cool reception when she flew to Washington to urge lawmakers to reject the tariffs. The measures, she says, would force price increases on at least 85 percent of the items in her store, just before the holiday shopping season begins.
"I couldn't get a feel if lawmakers -- if they didn't understand how it's going to affect consumers, or if it's just tougher in an election year," she said.
Cedar Electronics, in Illinois, which manufactures radar detectors, CB radios and other communications devices under brand names like Cobra, has warned that tariffs could threaten jobs at its manufacturing plant in West Chester, Ohio, where it produces custom-installed radar detectors. The plant imports components from China that have been hit by tariffs already, and has filed requests for tariff exclusions with the United States Trade Representative for products the company says it cannot source elsewhere.
"We're effectively being penalized for bringing manufacturing back to the United States," Christopher Cowger, Cedar's president and chief executive, said, adding that it was hard to get the Trump administration to hear that complaint.
"There doesn't seem to be a real path to success there," said Mr. Cowger, whose company has joined the campaign. "In the interim, it's about finding as many platforms, forums and pulpits, to tell our story."
Economic data have yet to show a surge of price increases related to tariffs, a fact that many business leaders acknowledge is working against their pitch to Mr. Trump. Trade groups and executives say that could quickly change if Mr. Trump follows through with additional tariffs on Chinese products.
The Federal Reserve's beige book, which collects anecdotes from business contacts across the country, noted increased warnings of price pressures from tariffs in its latest edition released on Wednesday -- though Fed officials have said they have yet to see such warnings translate into increased inflation.
"Tariffs were reported to be contributing to rising input costs, mainly for manufacturers," the beige book said. "Businesses' input costs have generally been rising more rapidly than selling prices, though there have been increased efforts to pass along cost hikes to customers."

Full text: Cratering currencies, rising inflation, jumpy investors: A financial panic is again gripping some of the world's developing economies.
The sharp sell-off of emerging market currencies, stocks and bonds seems to stand in stark contrast to the United States, where a nearly decade-long bull market continues amid buoyant economic conditions.
Higher interest rates in the United States and a stronger dollar rebalance the risks and rewards for investors the world over, and act as a kind of financial magnet, pulling them out of riskier investments.
When we've seen this before -- in the Mexican peso crisis of 1994, the Thai baht collapse of 1997 and the Russian default of 1998 -- investors had to contend with spillover of trouble from one country to others, dragging down economic growth or causing market stress.
So far in 2018, this kind of contagion has been limited.
Economies as varied as Argentina, Russia, South Africa and Turkey are facing the maelstrom, but each has its own reasons for falling out of favor, and the turmoil has yet to raise anxiety about the world's biggest economies and markets.
Here are the key issues that each is contending with.
Argentina
Investors were already jumpy because of past crises
One of South America's largest economies, Argentina spent much of the last two decades locked out of global markets, in the aftermath of its 2001 financial meltdown.
But the 2015 election of President Mauricio Macri was a turning point. He focused on returning the country to the good graces of international investors, by removing restrictions on the flow of capital in and out of the country, and reaching settlements with creditors still owed money since the 2001 collapse.
Argentina was able to regain access to the bond market in April 2016, when it raised $16.5 billion from international investors. Once it did, Argentina repeatedly turned to global investors, tempting them with high bond yields and pledges to gradually bring the country's spending problems under control.
Then, almost as suddenly as it started, Argentina's honeymoon with global investors ended this year -- for several reasons: A drought hit soy and corn production, which is crucial to the economy. The government showed little progress in reining in deficits. The central bank lowered interest rates even as inflation was rising fast, which was taken as a sign that it wasn't serious about keeping the peso on solid footing.
Given Argentina's history -- which includes crises in 1980, 1982, 1984, 1987, 1989 and 2001 -- investors were not willing to wait to find out.
The peso began to slide in April and is now down more 50 percent against the dollar this year. It has continued to drop even after the central bank raised interest rates to a whopping 60 percent and the International Monetary Fund approved a $50 billion line of credit in June.
Turkey
A strongman took things too far, and big business followed his lead
The Turkish economy enjoyed a ripping run over the much of the last decade. Growth has averaged roughly 6.8 percent since 2010, beating the world economy's 3.9 percent and other emerging markets, according to I.M.F. data.
But much of that economic pep depended on a debt-fueled bubble. Turkish companies have binged on bonds, much of them denominated in the dollar and the euro.
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government has been spending, too, subsidizing big-ticket infrastructure projects.
All that money owed in other currencies makes the collapse of the Turkish lira particularly problematic. The currency has been sinking steadily for years, resulting in a persistently high rate of inflation, but the sell-off turned into a rout after Mr. Erdogan was re-elected in June and given broad new powers that strengthened his control over the nation.
Mr. Erdogan has repeatedly railed against high interest rates as the economy shows signs of slowing. And his growing control over economic policy -- he installed his son-in-law as finance minister -- has investors nervous about his strongman approach. President Trump's August decision to double the tariffs on Turkish steel and aluminum imports seemed a catalyst for investors to beat a rapid retreat out of the country.
Now, with the lira down about 40 percent against the dollar since Mr. Erdogan's re-election, companies that are earning lira but have to repay debts in dollars are struggling. Bankruptcies of Turkish corporations are expected to rise, and many economists now think Turkey will soon to fall into a recession.
South Africa
A recession and a falling currency create a lose-lose situation
With one in four people living in extreme poverty, and an unemployment rate of more than 27 percent, South Africa's economy has long been one of the world's most precarious.
But in recent years, it has benefited from an influx of money from foreign investors. Much of that went to the government, which has tried to offset the nation's stark inequality -- it is one of the world's most unequal countries -- with large-scale social spending.
As a result, the country's external debts grew to roughly 50 percent of gross domestic product last year, from 37 percent in 2013. Much of that borrowing has been done via markets, making those investments much easier to dump when the going gets rough.
That's what investors have done.
South Africa's currency, the rand, is down by roughly 18 percent this year, and second-quarter data this month showed that South Africa was already in a recession. That further complicates matters, as the cure for the weak rand -- higher interest rates from the central bank -- could make the downturn even worse.
Russia
Global politics are isolating the Russian economy
Russia's problems with global markets are fairly idiosyncratic.
Since January 2017, the Trump administration has mostly continued the Obama administration's policy of imposing sanctions on individuals with ties to the country, citing issues such as aggression in Ukraine, interference in American elections, support for Syria's Assad regime, the poisoning of a former spy and his daughter with a chemical weapon in England, and trade with North Korea.
As global investors factored in the country's increased isolation from the world economy, the ruble fell 18 percent this year. (Simply put, less integration and trade with Russia mean less demand for rubles, which you need to buy Russian goods.)
A weak currency makes imports more expensive. Russian inflation, while low, has picked up, and interest rates are rising, both of which could be a drag on growth.
The Russian government plans to increase government spending in an effort to keep the economy grinding ahead. In theory, Russia's relatively low debt level -- government debt is less than 20 percent of G.D.P. -- allows it plenty of breathing room to spend more on roads, health care and social welfare, as long as it can dig up the money somewhere.
But therein lies the rub. With international investors wary of investing in Russia, it has had to rely in part on reshuffling domestic spending. Finding that money could mean making some unpopular decisions, such as raising the retirement age. Proposals to do just that are being blamed for a marked decline in the popularity of President Vladimir V. Putin, rare public protests and weaker-than-expected showings for the ruling United Russia party in recent regional elections.
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?
Good numbers don't mean anything without credibility
Where does all this stop? No one is sure.
It could be that the countries being battered may simply suffer from unique vulnerabilities to market pressure.
It's also possible that other countries will become the next focus for jittery investors eager to avoid losses. But predicting precisely where things will spread isn't simple.
Sure, there are some clues for what to look for. Investors are already looking askance at countries that owe a lot of money in foreign currency, for example. Screening for that kind of vulnerability would have identified Turkey as a potential problem spot.
The amount of such hard-currency debt to be paid off, however, is only part of the story. The level of interest rates, the reliance on foreign borrowers, refinancing needs, the size of government deficits and the stockpiles of foreign currency that can be used to push back market pressures all play a role.
Perhaps most important, and most difficult to measure, is a country's credibility with financial markets. If investors believe a country will continue to pay its bondholders in a currency that retains its value, they will likely put up with even the ugliest-looking levels of debt. If that trust starts to fray, look out below.

Full text: America shouldn't be in the coup business. Period.
It's a relief, then, to learn that the Trump administration chose not to aid rebellious leaders in Venezuela seeking to overthrow President Nicolás Maduro. But it's worrisome to think that President Trump and his advisers made the right call for the wrong reason -- lack of confidence in the plotters to succeed in a risky operation rather than principled concern about intervention.
There's no doubt Mr. Maduro is an illegitimately elected leader driving his country to a catastrophic political, economic and societal meltdown. American officials discussed the possibility of helping overthrow Mr. Maduro in three meetings over the last year with rebellious leaders, who had initiated the contact, The Times reported this past weekend.
Given the turmoil in Venezuela, it is not unreasonable for American diplomats to meet with all factions, including mutinous military officers, to learn their thinking. For instance, who would be in charge in a political transition process? What kind of government do they aim for?
But holding multiple meetings with the plotters begins to look like collaboration. The news was bound to leak out, as it has.
And the rebellious commanders had reasons to hope that the Americans might be sympathetic. Mr. Trump last year declared that the United States had a "military option" for Venezuela. Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, also hinted he favored military action. In a series of tweets, he encouraged dissident members of the armed forces to oust their commander in chief.
Yet if Mr. Trump is in fact tempted to intervene, or act militarily -- as past comments suggest -- he should contemplate the sorrowful history of American intervention in Latin America and its more recent history of trying to interfere elsewhere to depose dictators and install democracies.
For much of the past century, the United States compiled a sordid history in Latin America, using force and cunning to install and support military regimes and other brutal thugs with little interest in democracy.
Gunboat diplomacy in the early 20th century saw American Marines invading Cuba, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua and elsewhere to set up governments of Washington's choosing.
During the Cold War, the C.I.A. orchestrated the overthrow of Guatemala's elected president, Jacobo Árbenz, in 1954; the 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion in Cuba; and the 1964 coup in Brazil. It also helped create the conditions for the 1973 coup in which a military junta overthrew Chile's democratically elected president, Salvador Allende.
In later years, the United States backed the contra rebels against the Sandinista revolution in Nicaragua (1980s), invaded Grenada (1983) and supported brutal, repressive governments in Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras.
A vanishing few of these interventions came to anything that could be considered a good end.
Here's the right way to put pressure on Venezuela's regime: Mr. Trump and other leaders need to keep trying to encourage a transition deal by tightening targeted sanctions on Mr. Maduro and his cronies who undergird an autocratic, corrupt system. Cuba, which is dependent on Venezuela for oil and has close relations with Mr. Maduro, should be encouraged to use its leverage. Mr. Trump and other leaders also need to coordinate and expand assistance for Venezuela's suffering people.
It's heartening that the White House sent a diplomat to the meetings, rather than a C.I.A. officer, which would have been a more incendiary signal. Clearly a diplomatic path is better than having the United States meddle in yet another country, an enterprise certain to fail miserably.
But given Mr. Trump's decision to reimpose some sanctions on Cuba, his hard line on Nafta and his antipathy to multilateral endeavors, he doesn't have a lot of credibility or good will to work with as the region seeks an end to Venezuela's nightmare.
Which is cause for concern because there's no disputing that Mr. Maduro and his socialist vision have been a disaster for Venezuela and the region. Mr. Maduro needs to step down. The country was once among Latin America's most prosperous nations, and it has the world's largest proven oil reserves. But after two decades of socialist rule and vast corruption, the economy has collapsed and annual inflation may run as high as 1 million percent this year, according to the International Monetary Fund. Food staples and basic medicine are increasingly difficult to obtain. The humanitarian crisis has caused hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans to flee to Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and other neighboring countries.
As a result, although democracy has spread to most governments in Latin America over the past quarter-century, few people or leaders in the region would protest if Mr. Maduro were forced out.
Even so, American involvement in his ouster would inflame old regional resentments and suspicions toward Washington. News of the American meetings with the coup plotters has already been a propaganda boon for Mr. Maduro, providing fuel for his longstanding preposterous attempts to blame the United States for Venezuela's problems.
It's difficult to be optimistic about Venezuela, which many experts predict will collapse into anarchy. Still, backing a coup would also make it harder for Americans to advocate credibly on behalf of democracy around the world, an effort that is already compromised by President Trump's own trampling of democratic norms at home, and his enthusiasm for foreign tyrants.

Full text: Gunmen stormed the headquarters of Libya's national oil company in Tripoli on Monday, setting off explosions, taking hostages and spraying gunfire, leaving several people dead or wounded before forces aligned with the government took control of the building. The identity and motives of the assailants were not clear.
The oil company said two of its employees had been killed, and there were reports of two gunmen killed, putting the total number of dead at four. But an employee who escaped the assault said he believed that as many as six people had been killed, including three of the assailants.
The attack follows a month of escalating violence among rival militias competing for control of Tripoli, the capital, where a United Nations-backed government has its headquarters but remains largely powerless. Last week, clashes killed more than 60 people.
Any attack on the national oil company is significant because petroleum is the lifeblood of the Libyan economy, and competition for control of the country's vast oil reserves is at the heart of the often violent struggle for power there. Cuts in oil revenue because of the fighting have driven Libya into a severe financial crisis, with the government failing to meet the public payrolls, long lines forming at banks, and inflation soaring.
The employee who escaped, Baha Elddin, said in an interview that six men armed with "machine guns" had fought their way into the building. Three had blown themselves up, he said, and three others had climbed the stairs to the upper floors.
Mr. Elddin said that local militia fighters had responded to the incursion by besieging the building and that their gunfire may have caused the most casualties. "They started shooting at the assailants inside while the assailants threw grenades down on them from the second floor," Mr. Elddin said. "I think that most injuries happened because the respondents were shooting in."
On Facebook, a government-aligned militia described the assault as a "terrorist attack" and the assailants as "suicide bombers."
Speaking in the early afternoon in Tripoli, Mr. Elddin said that the battle had ended with as many as 10 employees injured, and that it was unclear whether the three assailants who had climbed the stairs had escaped.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack.
The chairman of the state oil company, Mustafa Sanallah, escaped unharmed, and experts said it was unlikely that the attack would directly affect Libya's oil production. But the events demonstrated that the country's oil infrastructure remains vulnerable.
"It's a reminder that the country remains at risk," said Riccardo Fabiani, a geopolitical analyst at Energy Aspects, a market research firm. "There is still a backdrop of violence and instability that could again cut production at anytime in the future."
Libya has descended into chaos in the seven years since the overthrow of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi. The United Nations and Western powers have tried to set up a government based in Tripoli that might be able to unify the country.
But so far, power in Tripoli and Western Libya remains divided among rival local or Islamist militias. A would-be strongman, Gen. Khalifa Hifter, dominates the Eastern area around Benghazi, thanks in part to the backing of Egypt and the United Arab Emirates.
The Islamic State group, also known as ISIS or ISIL, had controlled its own beachhead around the coastal city of Sirte until it was driven out by Western airstrikes and local militias in 2016. Many of its fighters have fled into the sparsely populated desert regions. They occasionally stage terrorist attacks on institutions of the rival governments backed by the United Nations and General Hifter, including a similar assault last spring on an election commission.
Several parties agreed in May to hold elections in December for a president and a Parliament. How and by whom that vote might be conducted and secured remains to be determined, and the recent fighting in Tripoli underscores the scale of the challenge.
Analysts say the National Oil Corporation has managed to remain neutral amid the turmoil. It has increased production -- which fell to almost nothing after war broke out in 2011 -- to around one million barrels a day.
That is still significantly below prewar output, but analysts say that under current circumstances, it is probably close to the maximum Libya can produce. Oil producing centers, pipelines and export terminals around the country are vulnerable to attack.
Monday's assault comes at a time of growing concerns about global oil supplies. As the Trump administration tries to cut off Iranian exports, they have declined to around two million a day in August from about 2.7 million barrels a day in May, and they are expected to drop to 1.5 million a day in September, according to Energy Aspects. Venezuela's output continues to decline amid political chaos and economic collapse.
"Too many market participants are way too complacent about Libya," said Helima Croft, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets in New York.
"We are one major supply outage away from a super spike," she added, referring to much higher prices.

Hints of Inflation Send a Chill Through China

Full text: BEIJING -- Pork is up. Vegetables are up. Gasoline is up. Even the official numbers, usually tame, are up.
Prices are rising in China -- and that could complicate Beijing's efforts to prop up a slowing economy and navigate President Trump's trade war.
Chinese officials said Monday that an index of consumer prices rose in August for the third consecutive month. The increases are not particularly sharp, and Chinese economists point to a number of temporary factors pushing up prices, like floods that have damaged crops and a swine flu epidemic that led farmers to cull pigs.
Still, investors and the Chinese public alike are casting a wary eye on prices.
Angus Tong, a 37-year-old Beijing resident, said his landlord wanted to nearly double the rent for his family's $1,200-a-month apartment. Rent already absorbs a third of his income and his wife's, while the family's monthly food bills have risen.
To save money, "we try to cook every meal at home," he said, adding, "I think most middle-income people feel the pressure from rising costs."
Higher prices could cause problems for Xi Jinping, the country's leader. They would mean China's leaders would have to be careful as they sought ways to bolster slowing growth, lest their efforts drive up prices still further. The trade war with the United States could also lead to higher prices for Chinese consumers and companies with tariffs raising the cost of imported goods.
"During the coffee breaks and the conversations, the topic of inflation is coming up," said Tai Hui, the chief Asia markets strategist for J. P. Morgan Funds. "We're starting to hear a lot more from investors. It's just a question of the severity."
For now, Chinese economists generally say there is little cause for alarm. "Disasters like the swine flu and disasters like the flood are not a very big impact on China as a whole, and are not a turning point," said Li Xuesong, the deputy director of the National Academy of Economic Strategy in Beijing.
Historically, inflation has been a major political and economic issue in China, a consequence of a hard-charging economy as well as previous bouts of runaway lending by state banks. Both can set the stage for surging prices, and at times they have surged indeed. Inflation contributed to the 1989 protests in Tiananmen Square.
But for nearly a decade, inflation has been of little concern. Years of heavy investment left the country with overcapacity in practically every industrial sector, from coal mining to steel making to shipbuilding. That makes it difficult for companies producing those goods to raise prices. This could be ending, however, as China pursues efforts to pare overcapacity.
China has also invested heavily in education, so the productivity of workers has risen quickly along with their wages. As a result, labor costs for getting jobs done have changed fairly little, as higher-paid yet more-skilled workers complete tasks more quickly than lower-paid but less-skilled workers a decade ago.
That, too, may be changing over the long term, however, as China's now-defunct "one child" policy and an unwillingness to have children lead to a shrinking of the labor pool.
China's official inflation figures have been tame, but people inside and outside the country widely disbelieve them. Western experts contend that the country's consumer price index broadly understates the effects of ever-rising housing costs. The index also understates a large number of lesser trends, including the shrinking size of meal portions in restaurants and changing fashions in clothing, they say.
Wigram Capital Advisors, an economic research group, has long calculated an alternative price index for China by taking government data on specific consumer goods and services and assigning them weightings based on actual household spending patterns in big Chinese cities. It shows that the annual rate of inflation jumped to 3.7 percent in August, from under 2 percent most of last year.
Check the Chinese term for "rising prices" on Baidu, a Google-like online search engine, and the mentions quintupled in the second half of August. But the use of a more intellectual term for "inflation" has changed little in recent months -- a possible sign that most of the complaints about rising prices may be from less-affluent Chinese citizens who are more affected by higher costs for basics.
Officially, consumer prices were up 2.3 percent in August from a year before, the country's National Bureau of Statistics said on Monday. Although marginally higher than economists' expectations of 2.2 percent, that is still modest. But it represented a gradual acceleration from recent months.
Some of the factors behind China's recent price increases look temporary. Wholesale prices for pork, the main meat in the Chinese diet, have climbed 17 percent since just mid-July, after an outbreak of swine flu, according to Agriculture Ministry data. Vegetable prices have climbed 21 percent since mid-July as flooding and a typhoon have damaged crops.
Goldman Sachs said last week that because much of the increase in pork and vegetable prices did not occur until late August, these increases would show up only partly in that month's data, and then drive inflation higher in September.
Other price increases may linger longer. World oil prices have climbed sharply in the past year, and China is the world's largest oil importer. China's currency has slid in value against the dollar this year, and that drives up the price of oil further for Chinese consumers because petroleum deals are done in dollars.
Housing costs are also rising, for new homes and for rents. Rents were up an average of 17 percent in July from a year earlier in 50 large cities nationwide. While most Chinese people live in their own homes, renting had been a refuge for young people who could not afford high prices for new apartments.
China has also continued to pump more money into its financial system to support growth, adding to potential inflationary pressure.
Then there are the American tariffs, which could have a mixed impact. They raise prices for imported goods. But any economic slowdown in China that results from reduced exports to the United States could slow Chinese inflation, said Louis Kuijs, a China specialist at Oxford Economics.
China has ways to protect its consumers. It controls the prices of many essential commodities. For pork, it keeps several months' worth frozen in what is called the strategic pork reserve.
The big counterweight to a broader rise in prices is that the Chinese economy is gradually slowing. Despite stepped-up government spending on infrastructure, a tax cut that is about to take effect and further monetary stimulus, that may continue. A broad rise in prices is less likely as long as the economy is weak, said Brad Setser, a Council on Foreign Relations economist.
If prices do rise more, however, then China may need to curb its local governments, which have shown an insatiable appetite for borrowing money to build ever more roads, bridges and industrial parks.
"Reining that in," Mr. Setser said, "provides an obvious way of countering inflationary pressures."

Full text: Here's what to expect in the week ahead:
TRADE
U.S. and European officials seek a trade pact.
Senior trade officials from the United States and the European Union will meet on Monday in Brussels in an effort to avert an all-out trade war. Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, and Cecilia Malmström, the European commissioner for trade, are trying to reach an agreement on a plan to cut tariffs on industrial goods to zero and prevent President Trump from carrying out a threat to impose 25 percent levies on car imports. An accord is unlikely on Monday, but businesses on both sides of the Atlantic will be looking for signs that the two sides are making progress.

AUTOs
An Investor lawsuit against Volkswagen opens.
A German court will begin hearing evidence on Monday in a lawsuit filed by aggrieved shareholders of the carmaker Volkswagen. The shareholders, who are seeking billions of euros in damages, contend that Volkswagen violated its legal responsibility to them when it deployed illegal software to cheat on emissions tests, then covered it up. The trial may be the first time high-ranking Volkswagen managers testify in open court about the origins of the scandal.

TECHNOLOGY
New Apple devices will be unveiled on Wednesday.
Apple is set to announce another round of iPhones on Wednesday, in its annual bid to get customers to buy devices that are a few centimeters larger with a few more features. Apple is expected to unveil iPhones based on its flagship iPhone X model, with a screen that takes up the entire face of the device, but a bit larger, according to news reports and leaked images. Apple is also expected to update the Apple Watch, the iPad and its Mac computers, according to the reports. Sales of iPhones have leveled off -- growth was less than 1 percent in the latest quarter -- but Apple has made iPhone revenues continue to surge by charging customers more. Its iPhone revenues rose 20 percent last quarter because customers paid nearly 20 percent more, on average, for the devices. The iPhone X already costs $1,000 so the question on Wednesday will be whether Apple is prepared to charge customers more than $1,000 for some iPhone models.

ECONOMY
Report will give a snapshot of household income.
The income of the median American household rose sharply in 2015 after years of stagnation, and continued to rise in 2016. On Wednesday, the Census Bureau will release an initial estimate for 2017, which is likely to show that growth continued for a third straight year. Median household income is a particularly telling measure of the health of the American economy. The rise of the stock market says that life is good at the top; the fall of the unemployment rate says that life is getting better at the bottom. Median household income is a snapshot of the middle, where most Americans live. As of the end of 2016, the median household was still making less than at the end of 2007. That gap may finally have closed last year.

______
Technology
European Parliament will vote on an internet copyright bill.
The European Parliament is scheduled to vote on Wednesday on an internet copyright bill that would require internet services to use filtering technology to screen out copyrighted music, writings and videos. Publishers, music companies and movie studios are among those pushing for the new law, saying it would limit internet companies' profiting off unlicensed content and help content creators receive fair compensation. Technology companies and open-internet supporters argue the proposal is overly aggressive, will create unfair legal liabilities for websites large and small, and will ultimately limit the information available online.
-- Adam Satariano
______
ENVIRONMENT
Government and business officials will discuss climate change.
About 4,500 governors, mayors, business executives and community leaders are set to meet in San Francisco for an international gathering on climate change beginning on Wednesday. The Global Climate Action Summit, which includes Gov. Jerry Brown of California and Michael Bloomberg, the former Mayor of New York as hosts, is a response to a United Nations request for renewed efforts to curb emissions following the Paris climate agreement.
During the three-day summit, attendees plan to announce new electric vehicle programs, energy storage projects and other initiatives. Some American cities and states have committed to the Paris accord despite President Trump's announced intention to withdraw from it.

______
ECONOMY
European Central Bank may signal the effects of the trade war.
Trade tensions will most likely be a key issue when Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, holds a news conference on Thursday after a meeting of the bank's Governing Council. The bank is not expected to make any major changes in policy, but its economists will issue their latest forecasts. Those should give an indication of how much the central bank believes that the trade war with the United States is hurting the eurozone economy.

ECONOMY
The Bank of England will probably keep rates steady.
The Bank of England raised its benchmark interest rate in August to 0.75 percent, its highest level since February 2009. Policymakers at the central bank will meet on Thursday, but are unlikely to raise rates again. They are more likely to do so later this year, but that would depend on how the economy fares and how expectations for inflation change as Britain's departure from the European Union draws closer. With Brexit looming, questions have been raised about whether Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, will extend his time there. "I am willing to do whatever else I can to ensure a smooth Brexit and an effective transition," Mr. Carney told British lawmakers at a Treasury Select Committee on Tuesday.
-- Amie Tsang
______
ECONOMY
Labor Department will reveal the August inflation rate.
On Thursday at 8:30 a.m., the Labor Department will release the latest reading on the Consumer Price Index for August. Inflation has been tame in recent months, despite faster economic growth, and economists expect the price index to rise by 0.3 percent. That would bring the year-over-year increase in prices to 2.8 percent.

______
RETAIL INDUSTRY
Retail industry hopes sales figures reflect bumper summer.
Retail sales figures, which the Census Bureau is scheduled to release on Friday, will be a good barometer of whether the solid economy is continuing to inspire Americans to open up their wallets and shop. This summer retailers have reported some of their best sales growth since the 2008 recession, reflecting a strong job market and a reordering in the retail industry after a wave of bankruptcies and store closures.

Full text: A painful recession was fading into memory, yet the expansion felt unsatisfying to many. There was evidence of huge technological leaps everywhere except in the data on worker productivity. And the unemployment rate was falling to levels that forecasting models predicted would trigger a burst of inflation.
That was the economic situation in the mid-1990s, and it also describes 2018. An intriguing -- and optimistic -- possibility for the years ahead is that the parallels with the 1990s won't end there.
Back then, technological advances that had been building for years finally started to translate into higher rates of productivity growth economywide. Some feared inflation, but Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, decided not to move pre-emptively to choke off the expansion. Instead, he advocated patience to see just how hot the economy could get without setting off a spiral of rising prices.
The result was the strongest period of growth and prosperity in recent decades.
History, of course, may not repeat itself. The mix of technological advances and sound economic policy that generated the 1990s boom simply may not materialize this time. Plenty of threats could send this expansion hurtling toward recession instead.
A trade war or emerging markets crisis or economic policy mistake could prove more powerful than economic fundamentals. And some of the technological advances that seem on the verge of fueling a productivity boom may take longer to develop than their enthusiasts assert.
But it's clear that some senior economic policymakers are at least open to the possibility of a boom. In a speech last month, the Federal Reserve chairman, Jerome Powell, discussed the 1990s experience in detail, suggesting that Mr. Greenspan's strategy at that time was one to emulate.
In 1996, many Fed policymakers wanted to raise interest rates to head off the risk of inflation. "But Chairman Greenspan had a hunch that the United States was experiencing the wonders of a 'new economy' in which improved productivity growth would allow faster output growth and lower unemployment, without serious inflation risks," Mr. Powell said.
"Meeting after meeting," he added, the Fed's policy committee "held off on rate increases while believing that signs of rising inflation would soon appear. And meeting after meeting, inflation gradually declined."
Mr. Powell wasn't forecasting that the same would happen in coming years; rather, he was preaching the virtues of Mr. Greenspan's strategy of risk management that allowed the boom to emerge.
The expansion of the last nine years has been steady and successful at putting millions of people to work, but it has fallen short in overall growth or in generating substantial boosts to incomes.
The culprit: productivity. The amount of output per hour of labor has been growing slowly. In the last five years, it has risen about 1 percent annually, compared with 2.1 percent on average since 1947.
If that changes, and businesses find ways to get more production of goods and services out of each hour of work, it should set the stage for higher wages and faster growth. That's what happened in the 1990s: Annual productivity rose an average of 1.8 percent from 1991 to 1995, then leapt to a 3 percent annual rate from 1996 to 2000.
What are the chances of a similar jump in the coming years, with similar beneficial results? Economists don't have a great understanding of what drives productivity advances, but there are three realistic possibilities of where gains might come from -- and they aren't mutually exclusive.
Solow's Paradox and Technological Diffusion
In 1987, the economist Robert Solow joked that "you can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics." That is, even as there were remarkable advances in semiconductors, software and desktop computing, it wasn't evident in any efficiency improvements in the overall economy.
The surge didn't arrive until well into the 1990s, and that pattern -- a long lag between a technological innovation and its full economic impact -- makes sense when you think about it.
For example, fewer corporate executives have a full-time secretary now than they did in the 1980s, in part because of innovations like voice mail, email and desktop word processors. But it's not as if companies suddenly fired a bunch of secretaries on the day they got a voice-mail system. It was a gradual process as more people became accustomed to answering their own phones and typing their own memos.
Just because some high-performing companies have started using a productivity-enhancing technology doesn't mean it has spread throughout the business world. By the early 1990s, Walmart became efficient in using computers to manage its supply chain -- at a time many retailers were still using old-school cash registers. It would be years before the bulk of the industry caught up. The Walmart catch-up effect was a major part of the late 1990s overall productivity surge, according to research from the McKinsey Global Institute.
Moreover, sometimes big innovations can actually make the economy less productive while they are being introduced. An automobile factory that's installing a robotic assembly line might employ many robotics engineers, but also autoworkers still making cars the old way. Even if the innovation eventually results in higher productivity, the company might need more person-hours of work per car produced in the short run.
What are the potential parallels in 2018?
Technological optimists have argued for years that artificial intelligence, machine learning, advanced robotics, augmented reality and other areas offer huge potential efficiency gains. As in Solow's Paradox from an earlier era, there's no evidence yet in the economic data, but perhaps that will change, as it did with an earlier generation of advances.
That's exactly what McKinsey consultants found in research published in June.
One day driverless cars may be a boon for productivity -- but right now they are a drag on it as thousands of skilled engineers work to develop the technology without generating a dime of economic output.
Similarly, farms may eventually increase their yield with artificial intelligence that allows them to automate the pulling of weeds and the application of fertilizer. Electrical utilities may be able to become more efficient using smart grids. Hospitals may be able to deliver better care for less money when computers help diagnose patients.
Will technologies like those be ready for prime time soon, or ever? That's the part we don't know for sure.
But there are other forces that will more clearly affect the productivity outlook in the next few years.
Tax Cuts and a Capital Spending Surge
At the root of conservative economic philosophy is that low taxes on capital, along with light regulation, will encourage businesses to invest more heavily, resulting in a more productive economy in the long run.
The next few years will be a test of that proposition.
The corporate income tax rate was cut to 21 percent at the start of the year, from 35 percent. The Trump administration's deregulation-minded appointees have had a year and a half to go about their work.
Oh, and the stock market is booming, and interest rates remain low by historical standards, implying companies should have plenty of access to capital on favorable terms if they want to make those investments.
In short, this should be a conducive environment for businesses to increase their "capital stock" -- the accumulated facilities, equipment, software and other intangible investments -- to enable workers to be more productive.
Is this investment actually happening? The evidence isn't definitive at this point. Business investment rose at an 11.5 percent rate in the first quarter of 2018 and 8.5 percent in the second quarter, both substantially faster than the economy as a whole. But that was fueled in part by a boom in energy exploration that was probably more tied to the rise in oil prices in 2017 than tax policy.
The nascent trade war may create a layer of uncertainty for businesses that have major customer bases overseas as they weigh big-ticket investments, working at cross-purposes with the stated goal of the tax legislation.
But the verdict on whether pro-business policy out of Washington will drive a surge in investment spending, with big benefits for productivity, will depend on more than a couple of quarters, and remains a real possibility.
The Tight Labor Market
Finally, the tight labor market could force businesses to find more efficient ways to deploy workers.
With the unemployment rate at 3.9 percent, near a several-decade low, companies in a range of industries have been complaining about the difficulty of finding qualified labor.
This shows up in headlines about trucker shortages, construction worker shortages and oil field worker shortages. It may eventually show up in faster growth in wages, no matter what happens to technological advances or business investment.
But one distinct possibility is that it will force businesses to act more creatively and aggressively about squeezing more economic output from each hour of labor.
Companies could invest more heavily in new capital -- think of automated checkout kiosks at retail stores or restaurants. Or companies could provide extra training so that each worker can get more done.
It could also happen through experimentation with new management techniques or other business practices; these would show up in what economists call "total factor productivity."
This isn't the traditional way economists think about productivity, but we see it in other contexts. When the minimum wage is raised, companies sometimes try to replace human labor with machines or focus on making their workers more productive.
The ultralow unemployment may have the same effect in the years ahead.
There is, for good reason, a tendency to focus on the risks of what can go wrong in the economy. The current expansion could become the longest on record next year, which makes the recession risk talk all the more relevant.
But the 1990s are a reminder that there can be good economic surprises as well as bad ones. Predicting the future is hard. And the parallels aren't perfect. But there's reason to wonder if economic history just might repeat itself.

Towering Over the Others, but at What Cost?

Full text: Much of the world has recovered from the global financial crisis of a decade ago, but one market has prospered above virtually all others: the United States stock market.
In addition to outpacing other major markets, the American market has outstripped the growth of the United States economy to such an extent that it is a global outlier. Whether the surge -- which has helped fuel economic inequality in the United States -- can continue, and what the domestic and global consequences might be, are unresolved questions.
The American market's exceptional performance stands in stark relief in a global survey of post-crisis markets and economies published this month by the Brookings Institution and conducted by Eswar Prasad, a Cornell University economics professor and senior fellow at Brookings, and Karim Foda, a former associate fellow at the institution.
"There has been a disconnection between stock markets and economies around the world, with stock markets generally outperforming their economies," Professor Prasad, a former International Monetary Fund official, said in an interview. "But the United States stands out. There's a much greater degree of outperformance and disconnection from domestic economic growth. And you don't typically see a disconnect like this for such a long period."
The Brookings survey shows, for example, that while the two biggest emerging market economies -- those of China and India -- have grown far faster than America's in the past decade, those countries' stock markets have not fared as well as their American counterpart. India's stock gains were substantial in its local currency, the rupee, but were almost eliminated when translated into dollars. The Chinese stock market has actually lost value since the financial crisis.
Since the end of 2007 through June of this year, the survey says, gross domestic product in the United States grew by 18 percent, after adjusting for inflation. "The U.S. leads the pack among major advanced economies," the report says, while noting that the American economy's growth trailed that of emerging market economies like those of China and India.
In nominal terms, without the inflation adjustment, gross domestic product in the United States grew more: 38 percent. But the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index nearly doubled from December 2007 through August 2018, a better return than other major stock markets experienced.
This trend -- stock markets growing much faster than domestic economies -- also appeared in advanced economies like those of Britain, France, Germany, and Japan, but it was much more extreme in the United States, the report says.
The American stock market's outperformance can be explained by factors like the rising share of corporate profits in the domestic economy and by the sheer force of American financial power on a global scale, Professor Prasad said.
Although the United States contributed mightily to the global financial crisis, it has been a source of financial stability for most of the last 10 years, attracting investments from around the world. The dollar has strengthened against most other currencies in that time, becoming, if anything, an even more central part of the world financial system, he added.
What's more, the dollar's strength has magnified the outperformance of the American stock market when compared against markets in most other countries.
India outpaced the United States in economic growth, and its stock market rose roughly 90 percent from December 2007 through last month, almost as much as the American stock market did, when both are tracked in their domestic currencies. But the Indian rupee lost ground against the dollar, and its weakness has wiped out most of the value of its stock market's gains: When converted into dollars, the Indian stock market rose only 6 percent.
China is the rare country whose currency, the renminbi, actually has strengthened modestly against the dollar since the end of 2007. But that was not enough to offset the decline of the Shanghai stock market, which fell 48 percent in renminbi and 45 percent in dollar terms.
The Chinese stock market, like the United States market, is an outlier, Professor Prasad said, but in a radically different dimension: The Chinese market has significantly trailed other markets as well as the Chinese economy.
One reason is that the Chinese stock market, to an even greater degree than the United States stock market, represents only a small slice of the country's overall economy. Publicly listed Chinese corporations, Professor Prasad said, tend to suffer from endemic structural problems: high debt levels, poor accounting disclosure and weak governance. Until these problems are solved, China may be risky for global stock investors.
The United States stock market, which has been a global magnet, is rife with its own anomalies. For one thing, Professor Prasad said, stock market growth has exceeded G.D.P. growth by so much and for so long that it bears close attention. "Over long periods there is typically a close correlation between stock market growth and economic growth," he said. "And this is already a long period."
That does not mean that the American stock market will necessarily fall soon. It is being supported by several macroeconomic factors, aside from cash inflows from foreigners. Corporate profits, supported in part by tax cuts and relaxed regulation and low interest rates, have been rising more rapidly than the G.D.P., while wage growth has been constrained.
Because stock ownership is concentrated among richer people, the rising market wealth has exacerbated economic inequality in the United States. "Most of the stock market wealth has been going to those who are already very rich rather than to the poor," Professor Prasad said. "The disconnect between the stock market and the real economy is manifest in the disconnect between corporate profits and real wages. It has potential sociopolitical implications."
In short, the American stock market could well keep rising for some time. But that might increase domestic political tensions, if increasing corporate and stock market riches are not accompanied by broad-based growth in wages.
From a global perspective, the American stock market appears to be attracting capital that might otherwise bolster other markets and economies. The United States market is exceptional and it has enriched stock investors. But the decade of outperformance has incurred mounting costs.

Full text: Martha Bonilla is not your typical middle-class worker. And it's not just that she was born in a backwater of El Salvador and crossed Mexico hidden among a pile of bananas in the back of a truck to make her way illegally into the United States at age 20.
Like millions of Americans lacking a college degree, the 44-year-old mother of three works on the bottom rungs of the service sector, in a kitchen run by the food-service contractor Restaurant Associates in Cambridge, Mass. Food preparation and service is the lowest-paid occupational group in the economy; even in Boston, it typically pays less than $27,000 for a full-time, year-round job.
Yet there Ms. Bonilla sits at her kitchen table in the solidly middle-class neighborhood of West Roxbury. She and her husband, Felipe Villatoro, both legal residents, bought the house 12 years ago for $350,000. It's their second; she rents the first to members of her extended family. The vacations in Florida, the 401(k), the $1,700 a month they pay for their daughter's college tuition and fees -- all speak of America's dream.
"Coming to the United States was the best decision I ever made," Ms. Bonilla said.
What's the trick? Ms. Bonilla's job with Restaurant Associates is to make breakfast and lunch for executives pursuing extension courses at Harvard Business School. At the university, service workers on the payroll of an outside contractor earn the same pay and benefits they would get as direct university employees -- including health insurance and pension benefits, paid vacation and child care assistance.
This parity policy was formally adopted across the university 16 years ago by Lawrence H. Summers, then Harvard's president. At a stroke, it ended the practice of outsourcing dining, security and other such services simply to save on labor costs. "The effect of this policy is to remove some of the economic incentives to contract out those positions," said Michael Kramer, organizing director at the Cambridge area local of Unite Here, the union covering food service workers.
Critically, unions covering Harvard's in-house janitors, cooks and guards -- which had been losing ground to outside contractors -- were empowered to bargain hard for pay and benefits without fear of encouraging more outsourcing. What's more, contractors themselves became more union-friendly once the university took over the determination of wages and benefits. In 2001, before the policy was put in place, only 58 percent of the workers at outside contractors operating at Harvard were represented by a union. By 2013, the share was 96 percent.
For Ms. Bonilla, the result is an hourly wage of more than $25. Adding the money from a part-time job cooking at a student dorm, most weeks she clears more than $1,500. That exceeds the typical weekly pay of a worker with a master's degree. Adding in the wage of Mr. Villatoro, also a cook at the business school, the family earns almost $120,000 a year.
As the wages of American workers without a college education languish below where they were 40 years ago, Harvard's experiment has led some economists and union organizers to think about similar arrangements to broadly benefit low-pay service workers, who form the biggest and fastest-growing part of the job market.
To be sure, Harvard's employment policies affect a limited population. Only 275 dining workers, 404 security guards and the 370 custodial workers are employed by subcontractors, and another 1,105 work for the university. It's an open question whether larger organizations, or those without multibillion-dollar endowments, can follow its lead.
"This is an important private-sector policy innovation -- a very good template for a socially minded organization," said Mr. Summers, whose tenure was sandwiched between his service as Treasury secretary in the Clinton administration and his time heading the National Economic Council under President Barack Obama. But he acknowledged that the experiment carries trade-offs.
Even if the goal is laudable -- lifting workers from the bottom of the labor market into the middle class, stimulating the economy and pushing against the country's widening wage inequality -- Mr. Summers noted that policies like these "make it more expensive to do the things you do." Setting too high a pay floor could force businesses to hire fewer people, making many worse off.
Still, some 45 million Americans work in low-end service jobs -- personal care aides, cooks, janitors, sales reps -- typically earning less than $30,000 a year. By 2026, the government projects, the number will be 50 million. Outsourcing is one of the main dynamics keeping their wages down, and the Harvard experiment is a useful case study of how institutions can use their clout to force a remedy.
Recent research by economists at four top universities and the Social Security Administration concluded that the parceling out of less-skilled work to low-wage contractors -- Goldman Sachs outsourcing its janitorial services, say, or Apple contracting out the assembly of its iPhones to Foxconn -- could account for around one-third of the increase of wage inequality in the United States since 1980.
That concern is on the mind of David Weil, who headed the wage and hour division of the Department of Labor during the Obama administration and is now dean of the Heller School for Social Policy and Management at Brandeis University. "The question is can we re-establish some normative minimum that is presumably above what sheer market forces would drive wages down to," Mr. Weil said. "The idea is to set a wage norm through a contracting standard."
How Student Protesters Forced Harvard to Change
Harvard didn't institute its parity policy simply out of the purity of its institutional heart. Rather, in April 2001, several dozen students from the Harvard Living Wage Campaign took over Massachusetts Hall, which housed the offices of the university's top administrators, demanding a better deal for campus workers. How could one of the richest educational institutions in the country, they asked, with an endowment worth billions, pay so many people so badly? At the time, nearly 1,000 workers at Harvard made less than $10.68 an hour (a little more than $15 today), the "living wage" wage minimum set by the city of Cambridge for some of its contractors.
"After three days we escalated," said Benjamin McKean, an undergraduate founder of Harvard's Living Wage movement. "We had 100 people sleeping in tents in Harvard Yard." Senator Edward M. Kennedy joined in the sit-in. Senator John Kerry also came by. The protest was covered in The Boston Globe and The New York Times. By the third week, the Harvard president at the time, Neil Rudenstine, yielded and asked a committee to report on how to improve workers' lot.
The panel -- boasting such big-time academics as David Ellwood, T.M. Scanlon and Martha Minow -- was headed by Lawrence Katz, who had once served as chief economist at the Labor Department. The group concluded that even after the longest economic expansion on record, from 1991 to 2001, outsourcing was driving campus wages down. Between 1994 and 2001, the pay of in-house service workers fell 7.5 percent on average, after inflation.
Custodians proved a useful case study. In 1980, Harvard directly employed nearly 1,000 of them. By 1996, the figure was just 260, and their compensation had suffered. What happened in the interim? The university pushed the Service Employees International Union to accept a contract with lower pay to better compete with outsiders.
"There are good reasons for outsourcing," Mr. Katz said. "But we identified outsourcing to get around labor obligations as the source of the problem." The committee he led did not recommend banning the use of contractors, as the living-wage advocates demanded. Nor did it accept their recommendation of setting a wage floor. Instead, by calling for wage and benefits parity for all campus workers, regardless of employer, it sought to remove outsourcing as a cost-cutting tool.
In January 2002, Mr. Summers, who had been inaugurated as Harvard president three months before, signed off on most of the committee's recommendations. The university instituted the parity policy and reopened contracts with service workers' unions to raise wages across the board immediately.
These days, a service position at Harvard is not a bad job. A janitor's starting wage of $22.69 beats that of 75 percent of janitors in the area. A grill cook -- the food-service worker with the lowest pay -- gets $21.27, more than almost 90 percent of food preparation workers in the Cambridge-Boston area.
Doris Landaverde, 39, got her high school diploma only last June. She cleans offices at Harvard's Extension School, making more than $23 an hour, plus she has access to benefits including holidays, sick leave, paid vacations, health insurance, a pension, tuition assistance and help with child care. As a result, she's a little skeptical about the value of going to college. "There are jobs that require a college degree and pay less than what I make," she said.
The idea is catching on beyond the ivy gates. The S.E.I.U. is trying to replicate Harvard's approach in airports around the country -- pressing public authorities to set wage floors to halt the erosion in pay for roles from baggage handling and security to airplane cleaning and catering.
For instance, the hourly wages of baggage porters declined by half as the share of outsourced work jumped to 84 percent from 25 percent between 2002 and 2012, according to a report by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, and Simon Fraser University in Canada. Like Harvard, the S.E.I.U. believes, airport authorities could impose norms to counter the trend. "We view the airport operator as the landlord," said Larry Engelstein, the director of collective bargaining for S.E.I.U. Local 32BJ, which covers the Northeast. "The landlord can impose conditions that contractors and carriers must satisfy to work on airport premises."
In San Francisco, to take another example, airport authorities have set minimum wage and training standards for screeners, baggage handlers, cleaners, fuelers, skycaps, customer service agents and other workers with access to secure areas. Now, the union is waiting for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to vote on a wage floor of $19 an hour by 2023, a move expected by late September.
But the Port Authority worries that airlines -- which outsource everything from the cleaning of planes to their on-flight meals -- will sue. The agency's chairman, Kevin O'Toole, said at hearings in July that officials "want to make sure when we vote for this minimum wage that it is bulletproof" against any judicial review.
The economics are tricky to get right. Clover Food Labs runs the cafe concession in Harvard's Science Center and another restaurant outside the university gates. Workers at the Science Center make Harvard wages, but pay at the outlet off campus ranges from $12.25 to $15.50 an hour, according to Clover's most recent employee handbook.
Ayr Muir, Clover's founder and owner, told me that to get the deal to work "required a lot of flexibility on Harvard's part." He couldn't jack up the price of his sandwiches at the Science Center to pay for the higher wages when his shop on Harvard Square was just 1,000 feet away. To make ends meet, he needed Harvard to give him a discount on rent. A "normal" restaurant paying an entry wage of $24, he said, "would go out of business."
The university doesn't calculate how much it might save if the parity policy were not in place. But the committee appointed to study the issue in 2001 came up with a rough estimate of $2.4 million to $3.7 million a year. This is pocket change for an institution like Harvard, whose operating expenses last year approached $5 billion.
But as Mr. Summers pointed out, across the economy, better jobs may mean fewer jobs. If, say, Massachusetts were to introduce a similar policy for public services, it would need to find the money. Taxpayers could provide it -- or the state could scale back services and cut jobs. And employers forced to pay more may attract better-trained workers, displacing less-educated ones.
There is a substantial body of research suggesting that modest increases to the minimum wage will have only a tiny effect on employment. But there is almost no research on what would happen if a cook's wage were set at $24, about twice the market rate. Most economists would probably agree that the number of cooks would fall.
Research by David Neumark, a labor economist at the University of California, Irvine, points out that in the parts of the economy most susceptible to automation, imposing a "living wage" might just accelerate the pace at which robots take over everybody's job.
Still, other economists suggest, Harvard's innovation deserves a shot. As the noted labor economist Richard Freeman argued in the opinion pages of The New York Times after the release of the Katz Committee's report in 2001, "Failure to spread prosperity widely has been the major failure in America's economic success."
Over the last 40 years, the earnings of workers in the middle of the distribution -- half earn more, half less -- have increased by an average of 0.16 percent per year, after inflation. That is very close to nothing. Workers without a college degree make about $20 less a week, in today's money, than they did at the millennium. With a labor movement dwindling into insignificance -- only 6.5 percent of private-sector workers are unionized -- economists like Mr. Weil and Mr. Katz suggest that new institutions are needed to hold up the bottom half.
Alan B. Krueger, a labor economist at Princeton who headed the Council of Economic Advisers under Mr. Obama, argues that the costs of introducing a parity policy like Harvard's in other workplaces would be "probably second order" -- too small to matter. Higher pay, he noted, brings about efficiency gains: Workers who are paid well are more loyal. They will exert more effort for the company. It's worth it even if they are more expensive.
Indeed, Mr. Krueger argues, "this kind of policy is pushing firms to a better equilibrium." From the standpoint of Massachusetts, he adds, think of all the new tax revenue that higher wages would bring about. By that reasoning, considering the consequences of low wages across society -- poverty and its contingent ills, family instability, addiction -- policies to set a floor on the price of labor could well justify their cost.

Full text: The American economy's stamina was showcased Friday as the government reported that wages in August sprinted forward at their fastest pace since the recession ended and that the job creation streak extended to 95 months.
But the Labor Department's latest bulletin also hinted that President Trump's tariffs could be starting to take a toll on manufacturing jobs.
"What's worth noting is that even though there still remains a lot of headline noise around politics and protectionism, underneath that, the U.S. economy -- and that includes labor markets -- is doing quite fine," said Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays.
Employers fattened payrolls by 201,000 jobs; the jobless rate remained under 4 percent, near territory not seen since the 1960s; and average hourly earnings rose by 10 cents, up 2.9 percent from a year earlier.
The manufacturing sector, however, which Mr. Trump has made a centerpiece of his economic and trade policies, registered fewer gains than had been previously thought. The combined addition of 93,000 jobs that the government originally reported for May, June and July was revised down to 62,000. And in August, the sector shed 3,000 jobs. The auto industry, which is particularly exposed to trade, eliminated 4,900 jobs last month after cutting 3,500 in July.
"You could tell the story that protectionism is taking some toll here," Mr. Gapen said. "In most of the manufacturing indices, all showed a drop-off in new export orders."
But other analysts warned against drawing too many conclusions from the latest payroll report -- which excludes agriculture, an industry that is very vulnerable to trade tensions. While some businesses will keenly feel the effects of tariffs, the mammoth United States economy is primary driven by domestic demand.
"Manufacturing employment creation was still pretty good" in previous months, said Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist at Northern Trust. "The impact of the tariffs that are in place now are annoying but modest in size and limited in scope, though the risk is certainly there. If tariffs broaden, we could see business activity impaired much more significantly."
Finally, a wage increase
Most of Friday's report illustrated the economy's resilience.
"This is the strongest labor market in a generation of workers," said Andrew Chamberlain, chief economist at the career site Glassdoor.
The latest figures relieved some of the persistent anxiety about sluggish wages, with an increase of 0.4 percent in average hourly earnings last month. The report most likely helped clear the way for the Federal Reserve to lift its benchmark interest rate this month.
Amy Glaser, a senior vice president at the staffing company Adecco, said she had noticed a significant change in employers' willingness to increase hourly wages. "Now clients are talking in terms of dollars instead of cents for wage increases," she said.
During the busy holiday season, employees often jump from one business to another for an additional 50 cents an hour, Ms. Glaser said. Companies are trying to head off that exodus, she said, by starting seasonal hiring earlier -- in August, instead of September and October -- and by offering higher starting pay.
In Louisville, Ky., where there are many distribution centers, jobs that have paid $12 to $13 an hour are reaching the $15 level, Ms. Glaser said. "The race for talent is just so tight, employers are trying to get any step ahead of their competition," she said.
At the same time, employers are doing more to develop their work forces.
Customer call centers in the retail and financial sectors are devoting more money to training, Ms. Glaser said. Because of the prevalence of texting and social-media slang, many service agents -- who typically earn $12 to $17 an hour, depending on the area and the job -- lack the required typing skills and professional telephone style.
Some companies, like Blue Ridge HealthCare in North Carolina, are taking more aggressive steps. Entry-level certified nursing assistants still earn $9 to $9.50 an hour, but the company has focused on training and incentives, said Cindy Cross, the system manager of recruitment and retention.
"There are individuals who really want to go back to school but can't pay for it," she said, so the company covers tuition and books, and then guarantees them a job after graduation. If staff members want further training to move up the career ladder, Blue Ridge will pay for that as well, Ms. Cross said.
Harder to get a receptionist job than into Harvard
Low-, middle- and high-skilled jobs all saw some wage growth. Even so, the job market can vary radically depending on what people do and where they live.
"In some occupations -- typically those with low-skill requirements and relatively pleasant working conditions -- there is a huge oversupply of candidates," said Julia Pollak, a labor economist at the online employment market site ZipRecruiter.
The listings afford a glimpse of the mismatch between what employers are offering and what workers are seeking.
Over the past year, for example, roughly 68,500 ZipRecruiter postings for administrative assistants attracted over 8.1 million applications, or 118 responses on average for every job. The 136,000 warehouse job listings drew over 9.2 million applications, or 68 per job.
Geography is critical: Lower-wage workers rarely move for a job, so openings in distant places, of course, might not be useful to them. Still, on average, Ms. Pollak wrote in an email, "it is harder (in some sense, at least) to get a job as an administrative assistant, receptionist or warehouse worker than it is to get into Harvard, with its relatively generous 5.2 percent acceptance rate" in 2017.
At the other end of the market, there are severe labor shortages for jobs demanding specialized skills, licensing requirements or tough working conditions. For the roughly 246,000 truck-driver listings on the ZipRecruiter site, there were 12 responses for each job, Ms. Pollak said. For the 237,000 skilled nursing jobs, there were just nine on average.
The biggest wage increases often accompany a job change. "There is a gap opening up between job-stayers and job-switchers," Mr. Chamberlain of Glassdoor said, with switchers getting raises that are nearly a percentage point greater over the past 12 months, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta's wage tracker. In July 2014, the percentage-point gap was just 0.6.
How tight is tight?
Although the headline jobless rate remained 3.9 percent, a broader measure of unemployment that includes part-time workers who would prefer full-time jobs, as well as discouraged workers, fell to 7.4 percent last month.
Over the past six months, 781,000 part-time workers have moved to full-time jobs.
A more disappointing corner of the report showed a decline in the share of so-called prime-age workers, those 25 to 54, who are working or looking for jobs. This figure dipped to 79.3 percent, from 79.5 percent in July. That is substantially higher than in the depths of the recession, but still below its 2000 level, when it exceeded 81 percent, said Elise Gould, an economist at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute.
The Labor Department's report provides only a partial and temporary barometer of the economy. The August estimates will be revised twice in the coming months. Overall job growth for June and July was revised down by 50,000 jobs, bringing the three-month average gain to 185,000.
As some economists warned of pending inflation, others maintained that the job market was not as heated as many employers suggest. Technological advances that replace workers and the availability of cheaper labor abroad have kept wages low, said Robert Frick, corporate economist with the Navy Federal Credit Union. "I still think there's slack in the work force."
Experts were also unsure what impact tariffs would have on jobs and the economy.
The issues surrounding jobs, trade and tariffs loom large in some states where Republican and Democrats are struggling to keep or flip congressional seats in the midterm elections.
The administration raised duties on steel and aluminum imports this year. And this summer the government rolled out tariffs on Chinese imports totaling $50 billion. Duties on goods worth an additional $200 billion are poised to go into effect as early next week, and Mr. Trump is threatening more. "I hate to do this, but behind that there is another $267 billion ready to go on short notice if I want," he told reporters Friday on Air Force One.
Christine McDaniel, a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University and a former White House senior trade economist, said it was still too early for the effect of the tariffs to show up in the data.
The manufacturing job losses so far are consistent with the historical record, she noted. Steel tariffs imposed by President George W. Bush in 2002, Ms. McDaniel said, were responsible for a net loss of jobs. There was a short-lived steelworker boom that disappeared soon after the tariffs were withdrawn. But the manufacturing jobs that were lost never came back, she said. Many employers invested in automation or other alternatives like offshoring, instead.
"These things take a while to play out, but we know how they played out in the past," she said.

Britain Urged to Tax Rich And Lift Wages in Report

Full text: Britain needs sweeping changes to redress its economic failings, rising inequality and the corrosive legacy of the financial crisis, according to a report from a committee that included the Most Rev. Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby.
The group outlined a 10-year plan for the sort of transformation experienced twice in Britain in the last century: once after the Second World War, when the state expanded its influence, and then in the 1980s, when Margaret Thatcher unleashed the free market to jolt the economy.
Commissioned by the Institute for Public Policy Research, a British public policy institute, the report, "Prosperity & Justice: A Plan for the New Economy," landed just as Britain is grappling with its looming exit from the European Union, or Brexit, a move that has already slowed investment and dampened economic growth.
Instead of focusing on Brexit itself, the document tried to tackle some of the factors that prompted the 2016 referendum and the resulting decision to quit the European Union. That vote, the report said, "was a stark repudiation of the status quo and crystallized profound feelings of economic injustice."
Several of the report's conclusions are eye-catching, including calls for stronger trade unions and worker representation on company boards, for higher taxes on the wealthy and on large inheritances, and for greater regulation of giant social media companies.
"For decades the U.K. economy has not worked as it should, with millions of people and many parts of the country receiving less than their fair share," said Archbishop Welby in a statement.
"The widening gulf between rich and poor, and fears about the future among young people and their parents, have damaged our nation's sense of itself," he said, adding that "achieving prosperity and justice together is not only a moral imperative -- it is an economic one."
The committee included academics, business executives and a trade union leader as well as Archbishop Welby. He has spoken publicly on policy issues before, but his comments may rankle those who feel the church should stay away from the political arena.
Over all, the report painted a bleak picture of the country's economic performance, arguing that "it is impossible to escape a palpable feeling that the economy is not working for most people."
The report found that "earnings that have been stagnant for a decade are combined with greater insecurity at work."
It added: "Young people have been hit particularly hard -- many unable to afford a home of their own and on course to be poorer than their parents. Whole communities feel left behind. Many people feel powerless and fatalistic."
Many of the proposals are likely to be welcomed by the opposition Labour Party, led by Jeremy Corbyn, which is calling for an increase in government spending, greater investment in industry and the nationalization of the railways and some other utilities.
But Conservative Party politicians have also worried for years about low British productivity. When Prime Minister Theresa May came into power in 2016, she said she wanted to help families who were "just about managing," and to increase the representation of workers on company boards.
Much of that agenda faded, however, after Mrs. May lost her parliamentary majority in last year's general election, and as she fights a bitter internal battle over her plans for Brexit.
The report also called for a rebalancing of economic power from corporations to trade unions, greater devolution of political power away from London, moves to create more affordable housing and to combat house price inflation, higher taxes on the very wealthy and efforts to incentivize long-term investment over short-term profit.
It urged greater use of robotics and automation alongside retraining for those whose jobs are lost.
Among more than 70 recommendations are an increase in the minimum wage, higher pay for those on employment contracts that do not guarantee work and the inclusion of workers on boards of companies with 250 or more employees.
Tax on corporations should be raised, and work and wealth should be taxed on an equal basis, the document suggested. It also proposed that the inheritance tax should be replaced with a lifetime gift tax, levied on recipients rather than estates.

Full text: You won't lose much money if you're prepared for the worst.
While the stock market has been hot lately, warnings of trouble ahead have been multiplying. And the odds of a recession by 2020 are mounting, or so the warnings go.
But what if the good times that are evident in important sectors of the markets and the economy just keep rolling, at least for a while?
That bullish possibility has arguably been underplayed, given the strength of the current numbers. And there is a strong, contrarian case that failing to appreciate the power of the current economy and markets will have serious implications that transcend finance and affect politics, too, generally helping Republicans and hurting Democrats.
Consider, first, that after months of setbacks, the American stock market reached new highs repeatedly over the last few weeks. In fact, it was one of the best Augusts the stock market has had in years.
What's more, consumer confidence has soared to levels unseen since October 2000, according to the Conference Board. And the United States economy's annual growth rate -- 4.2 percent in the second quarter -- was the best in nearly four years, while the unemployment rate, 3.9 percent, hovers near its lowest level in decades.
That statistical snapshot depicts a stock market and an economy that are prospering. Barring an unexpected event, the simplest prediction is that we'll have more of the same. Why, then, are so many people worried that bad times are coming?
I'll confess that I'm a worrier myself, having written recently that Vanguard, the widely trusted $5 trillion money manager, says the risks of a recession by 2020 have risen while the prospects for financial markets over the next decade have declined.
The Vanguard arguments are compelling: Short-term interest rates are rising faster than longer-term ones, moving us closer to a critical threshold for a dreaded inflation predictor, a so-called inverted yield curve. And credit markets are heading in a direction that often presages economic stress.
Furthermore, the long rallies in both the stock and the bond markets, which have made investing look relatively easy since early 2009, are unlikely to be sustained for years to come. At some point, they will falter. It appears that the bond market may already have begun to do so. Vanguard projects reduced returns for stocks and bonds over the next decade.
In addition, the risk that the markets and economy will be derailed by a truly major political, constitutional, military or trade crisis during the Trump administration, while difficult to quantify, cannot be easily dismissed. There are many potential calamities to choose from. Any one of them could lead to an economic disaster.
But timing is everything. Even if you are convinced that disaster is coming, deciding exactly when to take risk out of your portfolio matters tremendously.
From a purely financial standpoint, staying on the sidelines in the current bull market has been excruciatingly costly. From the beginning of this year through Thursday, for example, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index returned 9.9 percent. If the market keeps powering ahead, and you avoid stocks entirely because you are afraid of a crash, you will fall further behind.
There are political implications, too. There are already ample reasons to suspect that the current strength of the market and the economy is hurting Democrats in their efforts to regain control of Congress in the November midterm elections.
Ray C. Fair, the Yale professor who is a pioneer in demonstrating the predictive power -- and the limits -- of economics in election forecasting, has quantified that issue. He says that the surge in gross domestic product growth in the second quarter appears to have given the incumbent Republican Party a measurable boost.
His forecasts, made with an open-source program that he maintains as a teaching tool on his Yale website, are not always entirely on the mark, but they are always instructive. They disregard the specifics of campaigns and candidates, focusing only on shifts in the economy and a series of historical correlations, like the tendency of voters to become bored with incumbent politicians, counterbalanced by the tendency of a strong economy to favor the incumbent party.
Using only economic variables and data from elections over the last century, Professor Fair projects that the Democratic Party is likely to win 50.74 percent of the two-party popular vote for the House. "It is probably less than what the Democrats need to gain control of the House, although I do not have an equation that translates the vote share into House seats," he said on his website.
In an interview, Professor Fair explained: "I don't attempt to convert the popular vote into an actual forecast, state-by-state, with all the gerrymandering and other factors that are so important. I leave that to the political scientists."
The second quarter G.D.P. growth -- a variable in his equation that captures the good feelings generated by the economy and the stock market -- had the effect of subtracting about 1 critical percentage point from the Democratic share in his projection. Another strong showing in the current quarter, which he defines as an annual growth rate of at least 3.2 percent, would move the Republicans ahead in the popular vote in November, according to his algorithm.
But he is the first to admit that his equations don't capture the inimical style of President Trump. For the last presidential election, for example, Professor Fair's algorithm indicated that economic as well as political factors strongly favored the Republican Party. His projections said Republicans would capture 56 percent of the popular vote, giving its presidential candidate a landslide victory. Professor Fair was off by 7.1 percentage points (though he did project a Trump victory, unlike most forecasters).
"Had the Republicans nominated a more mainstream candidate, they may have done much better -- much closer to what the equation was predicting," he wrote. Mr. Trump's "personality" and combative approach to politics could reduce the Republican tally again in the midterm elections, according to Professor Fair, and swing the vote to the Democrats. "I just have no way of capturing that," he said.
Mr. Trump's unconventional approach to the presidency is undoubtedly making it more difficult, as well, to accurately assess the trajectory of the markets and the economy themselves.
Edward Yardeni, an independent stock market analyst, made that point in a series of reports in August. Mr. Yardeni, who describes himself as "a conservative-leaning fellow," said that on contentious issues, from tax cuts to trade disputes to deregulation, financial markets have been "giving quite a bit of weight to the possibility that this all will lead to less protectionism and greater global prosperity" -- and to a rising stock market.
That's not my baseline assumption, but it could happen. What if the stock market keeps ascending, the economy continues to grow, and Mr. Trump and a flock of Republicans do their utmost to take credit for it?
I'm hedging my bets.

Full text: It's hard to think of a company that seems less likely to transform health care.
It isn't headquartered in Silicon Valley, with all the venture-backed start-ups. It's not among the corporate giants -- Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase -- that recently announced, with much fanfare, a plan to overhaul the medical-industrial complex for their employees.
And it is among the most hated companies in the United States, according to many surveys on customer satisfaction.
It's Comcast. The nation's largest cable company -- the $169 billion Philadelphia-based behemoth that also controls Universal Parks & Resorts, "Sunday Night Football" and MSNBC -- is among a handful of employers declaring progress in reaching a much-desired goal. In the last five years, the company says, its health care costs have stayed nearly flat. They are increasing by about 1 percent a year, well under the 3 percent average of other large employers and below general inflation.
"They're the most interesting and creative employer when it comes to health care benefits," said Dr. Bob Kocher, a partner at Venrock, a venture capital firm whose portfolio companies have done business with Comcast. (The cable company declined over several months to provide executives for an interview on this topic.)
Comcast, which spends roughly $1.3 billion a year on health care for its 225,000 employees and families, has steered away from some of the traditional methods other companies impose to contain medical expenses. It rejected the popular corporate tack of getting employees to shoulder more of the rising costs -- high-deductible plans, a mechanism that is notorious for discouraging people to seek medical help.

Most employers now require their workers to pay a deductible before their insurance kicks in, with individuals on the hook for $1,500, on average, in upfront payouts, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Instead, Comcast lowered its deductible to $250 for most of its workers.
"We believe that no one should be required to be an expert in health care," Shawn Leavitt, the executive overseeing benefits at Comcast, said in a 2015 interview with a consultant. "Our model is based on providing employees support and assistance in making the right decisions for themselves and their families. Employees should not feel alone, confused and overwhelmed when it comes to understanding and selecting their benefits."
Cable TV subscribers who have felt confused and overwhelmed when dealing with Comcast customer service may be surprised to learn how nimbly the company has upgraded services for its employees. While Comcast continues to work with insurers, it has largely shunned them as a source of innovation. Instead, it has assembled its own portfolio of companies that it contracts with, and invests in some of them through a venture capital arm, Comcast Ventures.
Turning to health start-ups for new benefits
One such company is Accolade, in which Comcast is an investor, and which provides independent guides called navigators to help employees use their health benefits. Another, called Grand Rounds, offers second opinions and help in finding a doctor. Comcast was also among the first major employers to offer workers access to a doctor via cellphone through Doctor on Demand, a telehealth company.
"We see the start-up community as where the real disruption is taking place," said Brian Marcotte, the chief executive of the National Business Group on Health, which represents large employers. "We weren't seeing enough innovation." The group now vets some of these companies for employers, including Comcast.
Comcast "is the tip of the spear," Mr. Marcotte said.
The corporation, of course, is controlling costs and offering these unusual benefits out of self-interest. And these services are sometimes handed out at the expense of improving wages. In a tight labor market, Comcast also needs to remain competitive for not only highly skilled employees, but also lower-wage workers whose direct contact with customers has generated so much dissatisfaction over the years. "We do these things because it's great for business," Mr. Leavitt said.
But much of what sets Comcast apart is its willingness to directly tackle its medical costs rather than relying on others -- insurers, consultants or associations. It's a luxury only the largest companies can afford, and roughly a fifth of big companies continue to see annual cost increases of more than 10 percent, according to Mercer, a benefits consultant.
While fate may play a role -- a single expensive medical claim can drive up a company's costs in any given year -- employers, like Comcast, that use a variety of strategies tend to have the lowest annual increases. "You attack this thing from different angles," said Beth Umland, Mercer's director of research for health and benefits. "The intensity of effort pays off."
Some companies are shaking up hospitals and doctors
Other employers are focusing more attention on unsatisfying hospitals and doctors. Walmart has been at the forefront of efforts to direct employees to specific providers to get medical care, even if it means paying their travel to places like the Mayo Clinic.
The retailer said it had found, for example, that employees were being told they needed back surgery even when they would not benefit from the procedure. "Walmart isn't going to stand for this," said Marcus Osborne, a benefits executive, at a health business conference. "We aren't going to sit around to try to build another coalition or bureaucracy."
The majority of working-age Americans -- some 155 million -- get their health insurance through an employer, and most companies cover their own medical costs. The companies rely on insurers to handle the paperwork and to contract with hospitals and doctors. Insurers may also suggest programs like disease management or wellness to help companies control costs.
But employers, including that Amazon-Berkshire-JPMorgan alliance, are increasingly unhappy with the nation's health care systems. Companies are paying more than they ever have. And their employees, saddled with escalating out-of-pocket costs and a confusing maze, aren't well served, either. "The results haven't been there," said Jim Winkler, a senior executive at Aon, a benefits consultant. "There's frustration."
At Comcast, some workers probably miss out on the new ventures altogether and others don't have much choice but to go along. The company's relationship with labor is often strained, and it has largely managed to fend off efforts by groups like the Communications Workers of America to organize its employees. Robert Speer, an official with a local of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers in New Jersey that represents about 180 workers, noted the company's use of independent contractors to do much of its work, none of whom are eligible for benefits and can be paid by the job rather than hourly. "You are making no money," he said.
And, like many other workers, many employees are being pinched by the rising cost of premiums, Mr. Speer said.
Comcast workers with company coverage are told to go to Accolade first. Its phone number appears on the back of their insurance cards and on the benefits website. "The key to Accolade's success is being the one place to go," said Tom Spann, a co-founder of the company.
Geoff Girardin, 27, used Accolade when he worked at Comcast a few years ago and he and his wife were expecting. "Our introduction to Accolade was our introduction to our first kid," Mr. Girardin said. He credits Accolade for telling him his wife was eligible for a free breast pump and helping find a pediatrician when the family moved. "It was a huge, huge help to have somebody who knew the ins and outs" of the system, he said.
For employees like Jerry Kosturko, 63, who survived colon cancer, Accolade was helpful in steering him through complicated medical decisions. When he needed an M.R.I., his navigator recommended a free-standing imaging center to save money. "They will tell me what things will cost ahead of time," Mr. Kosturko said.
A nurse at Accolade helped him manage symptoms after he had surgery for bladder cancer in 2014. He developed terrible spasms because, he said, he wasn't warned to avoid caffeine. The Accolade nurse thought to ask him and quickly urged him to call his doctor for medicine to ease his symptoms.
Mr. Kosturko also turned to Grand Rounds when his doctor thought he might need to stay overnight in the hospital to be tested for sleep apnea. The second opinion convinced him he did not.
In complicated cases, Grand Rounds can serve as a check on the network assembled by the insurer. It pointed to the case of Ana Reyes, 39, who does not work for Comcast and had contacted Grand Rounds after treatment for cervical cancer. When she continued to have symptoms, she says, she was told to wait to see if they persisted.
"This is my life at stake," she recalled in an interview. "I need to know what I'm doing is the best plan." Grand Rounds asked a specialist at Duke University School of Medicine, Dr. Andrew Berchuck, to review her case.
"Grand Rounds was able to get all my medical records, which is over 1,000 pages," Ms. Reyes said. Dr. Berchuck reviewed and wrote his opinion in one week, recommending a hysterectomy because she was likely to have some residual cancer. "The same day, my treating physician, she called me to schedule a hysterectomy," Ms. Reyes said.
Insurers are usually none too pleased with the employers' use of alternatives: They're reluctant to share information with an outside company and poised to undercut a potential competitor by offering a cheaper price. They may even refuse to work with some of the companies.
The largest employers push back. Fidelity Investments insists on cooperation between insurers and outsiders, said Jennifer Hanson, an executive at Fidelity Investments. "Those who don't will be fired," she said at a health business conference.
For Comcast, the next frontier is the financial well-being of its employees, many of whom live paycheck to paycheck and may not be able to afford even a small co-payment toward a doctor's visit. Employees who run into financial trouble have no independent source of information, Mr. Spann said.
After talking to hundreds of companies, Comcast Ventures could not find a financial services start-up that would help employees without trying to sell them a product or earning their money on commissions. So Comcast recruited Mr. Spann to serve as chief executive of a new company, Brightside, that it created and invested in.
Employees who are less worried about their finances may be less likely to miss work or suffer from health problems, Mr. Leavitt said. Ultimately, he said, "there is a productivity play for Comcast."

Full text: "What's in a name?" asked Shakespeare. But hey, I'm an economist, so let me ask a somewhat different question: What's in a number?
Quite a lot, suggest Senators Chuck Schumer and Martin Heinrich. This week they introduced a bill that would direct the Bureau of Economic Analysis, which produces estimates of gross domestic product, to produce estimates telling us who benefits from growth -- for example, how much is going to the middle class.
This is a really good idea.
Now, I'm not one of those people who think G.D.P. is a terribly flawed or useless statistic. It's a number we need for many purposes. But on its own it isn't an adequate measure of economic success.
There are a number of reasons this is true, but one key issue is that it tells you only what's happening to average income, which isn't always relevant to how most people live. If Jeff Bezos walks into a bar, the average wealth of the bar's patrons suddenly shoots up to several billion dollars -- but none of the non-Bezos drinkers have gotten any richer.
There was a time when asking who benefits from economic growth didn't seem urgent, because income was rising steadily for just about everyone. Since the 1970s, however, the link between overall growth and individual incomes seems to have been broken for many Americans. On one side, wages have stagnated for many; adjusted for inflation, the median male worker earns less now than he did in 1979. On the other side, some have seen their incomes grow much faster than the income of the nation as a whole. Thus C.E.O.s at the largest companies now make 270 times as much as the average worker, up from 27 times as much in 1980.
A similar disconnect between overall growth and individual experience seems to lie behind the public's lack of enthusiasm for the current state of the economy and its disdain for the 2017 tax cut. G.D.P. numbers have been good in recent quarters, but much of the growth has gone to soaring corporate profits, while median real wages have gone nowhere.
But how do facts like these fit into the overall story of economic growth? To answer this question, we need "distributional national accounts" that track how growth is allocated among different segments of the population.
Producing such accounts is hard but not impossible. In fact, the economists Thomas Piketty, Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman have already produced estimated accounts with considerable detail over the past half century. The main message is one of growth going disproportionately to the top and not shared with the bottom half of the population, but there are also some surprises in the other direction. For example, the middle class, while still lagging, has done better than some common measures indicated thanks to fringe benefits.
But there's a big difference between estimates produced by independent economists and regular reports from the U.S. government, both because the government has the resources to do the job more easily, and because people (and politicians) will pay more attention. That's why the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, a progressive think tank, has been campaigning for something like the Schumer-Heinrich bill.
So why not do this?
Some might argue that creating distributional accounts is tricky, that it requires making some educated guesses about how to pool different sources of information. But that's true of the process used to create existing national accounts, including estimates of G.D.P., too! Economic numbers don't have to be perfect or above all criticism to be extremely useful.
In a reasonable world, then, something like the Schumer-Heinrich bill would become law in the near future. In the real world, of course, the proposal will go nowhere for the time being -- because Republicans don't want anyone to know what distributional national accounts might reveal.
By now everyone knows that conservatives routinely yell "socialist!" whenever anyone proposes doing something to help less fortunate members of our society -- which is a key reason so many Americans now think favorably of socialism: If guaranteed health care is socialism, bring it on. But the right doesn't just cry foul at any attempt to limit inequality; it does the same thing whenever anyone tries to talk about economic class, or measure how different classes are faring.
My favorite example here is still former senator Rick Santorum, who denounced the term "middle class" as "Marxism talk." But that was just an especially ludicrous version of a general attempt on the right to suppress talk about and research into where the economy's money goes. The G.O.P.'s basic position is that what you don't know can't hurt it.
And to be fair, progressives like the idea of distributional accounts in part because they believe that more knowledge in this area would help their own cause. But here's the thing: Knowledge is objectively better than ignorance. And in modern America, knowing who actually benefits from economic growth is really, truly important. So let's make finding that out, and disseminating the results, part of the government's job.

Full text: Iran's Parliament voted on Sunday to remove the economics and finance minister, the state news media reported, dealing another blow to President Hassan Rouhani as the country faces high unemployment and inflation, as well as a weakened currency.
Critics of the ousted finance minister, Masoud Karbasian, said the government had failed to shore up the economy after President Trump reinstated sanctions on Iran. Lawmakers voted 137 to 121 to remove Mr. Karbasian, continuing a shake-up of the top managers of the Iranian economy; early this month, lawmakers voted to dismiss the labor minister, and Mr. Rouhani replaced the head of the central bank in July.
Iran's currency, the rial, has lost half of its value since April, and the repercussions are being felt daily by ordinary Iranians.
The Trump administration reimposed sanctions on Iran this month after withdrawing from the 2015 nuclear deal, which Washington saw as inadequate for curbing Tehran's activities in neighboring Middle East countries and denying it the means to make an atomic bomb. A second set of sanctions, targeting Iran's oil industry, is due to take effect in November.
Mr. Trump's decision to reimpose sanctions has accelerated a capital flight from Iran that hastened the rial's decline, unnerving Iranians who saw it as a warning of economic calamity.
Demonstrations across Iran began December -- protesting the weak economy, strict Islamic rules, water shortages, religious disputes and local grievances -- eventually spreading to more than 80 cities and towns and resulting in 25 deaths. Sporadic protests, led by truck drivers, farmers and merchants in Tehran's bazaar, have continued regularly since, occasionally resulting in violent confrontations with security forces.
The commander of Iran's elite Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, Maj. Gen. Ali Jafari, said on Sunday that Iran was facing a "unique, complicated and sensitive" situation, with both external and internal threats to its security, the news agency Tasnim reported.
Washington's withdrawal from the nuclear deal has undermined Mr. Rouhani and emboldened his hard-line opponents, who opposed any compromises with the United States.
Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif appeared to offer guarded criticism of Mr. Rouhani's opponents.
"There are some in the country who, instead of laying the groundwork for using the opportunities presented by the nuclear deal, chose a political fight," the news agency ISNA quoted him as saying. "And this political fight led to despair and disappointment."
Iran has sued the United States at the International Court of Justice to try to nullify the nuclear sanctions reimposed by Mr. Trump.

Report expected to criticize Volkswagen's progress since scandal
A former prosecutor assigned to monitor Volkswagen after its emissions scandal will release a report on Monday detailing whether the carmaker has complied with the terms of a civil settlement with the United States. Larry Thompson, who was a deputy attorney general from 2001 to 2003, will hold a news conference at Volkswagen's headquarters in Wolfsburg, Germany, to announce his findings, which are expected to be critical of the carmaker's progress toward becoming a more ethical company. Mr. Thompson faulted Volkswagen in a report this year for failing to hold executives accountable and for not making a serious enough attempt to remake its culture. Volkswagen must correct any shortcomings or the company could wind up back in court.

Hearings wrap up on additional $200 billion in China tariffs
On Monday, the Trump administration will hold its final day of hearings allowing companies to weigh in on the prospect of tariffs on an additional $200 billion of Chinese goods. President Trump has already imposed levies on $50 billion worth of Chinese imports and has threatened additional moves to try to force China to change its trade practices. So far, the United States has been unable to persuade China to make substantive changes to its economy. In five days of hearings last week, most companies testified that the tariffs would raise their costs and make it harder for them to operate in the United States.

German bankers to discuss strategies to combat crisis
The German economy is humming, but the country's banks are seemingly in perpetual crisis, and now they are threatened by technological change that opens them up to new competitors. German bankers and financial service providers will discuss those and other challenges in Frankfurt on Wednesday and Thursday during a conference sponsored by Handelsblatt, a financial daily newspaper. Prominent speakers include Olaf Scholz, the German finance minister, and Christian Sewing, chief executive of Deutsche Bank.

Economy
Consumer spending probably stayed strong in July
Strong spending by consumers helped power the American economy to its best showing since 2014 in the second quarter of the year, and on Thursday, numbers from the Commerce Department will reveal whether consumers kept that momentum up in July. There is reason to think they did. Retail sales numbers released earlier this month showed strong growth, and confidence in the economy is high. Wage growth, however, has been disappointing, despite the low unemployment rate, and inflation has been taking a bigger bite out of Americans' earnings. Both factors could help keep a lid on spending. Policymakers at the Federal Reserve will be watching Thursday's report closely for hints that prices are rising more quickly. If they are, it could be more likely that the Fed will raise interest rates two more times this year.

Tying Behemoths To Stagnant Pay And Low Growth

Full text: JACKSON HOLE, Wyo. -- Two of the most important economic facts of the last few decades are that more industries are being dominated by a handful of extraordinarily successful companies and that wages, inflation and growth have remained stubbornly low.
Many of the world's most powerful economic policymakers are now taking seriously the possibility that the first of those facts is a cause of the second -- and that the growing concentration of corporate power has confounded the efforts of central banks to keep economies healthy.
Mainstream economists are discussing questions like whether "monopsony" -- the outsize power of a few consolidated employers -- is part of the problem of low wage growth. They are looking at whether the "superstar firms" that dominate many leading industries are responsible for sluggish investment spending. And they're exploring whether there is an "Amazon Effect" in which fast-changing pricing algorithms by the online retailer and its rivals mean bigger swings in inflation.
If not yet fully embraced, the ideas have become prominent enough that this weekend, at an annual symposium in the Grand Tetons, leaders of the Federal Reserve and other central banks discussed whether corporate consolidation might have broad implications for economic policy.
"A few years ago, questions of monopoly power were studied by specialists in a very technical way, without linking them to the broader issues that animate economic policy," said Jason Furman, an economist at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, who advanced some of these ideas in his former job as the Obama White House's chief economist. "In the last few years, there's been an explosion of research that breaks down those walls."
Central bankers tend not to chase the latest research fads, as Mr. Furman put it. But they, too, are wrestling more intensely with the possibility that the details of how companies compete and exert power matter a great deal for the overall well-being of the economy.
While these topics more commonly show up in debates around antitrust policy or how the labor market is regulated, it may have implications for the work of central banks as well. For example, if concentrated corporate power is depressing wage growth, the Fed may be able to keep interest rates lower for longer without inflation breaking out. If online retail makes prices jump around more than they once did, policymakers should be more reluctant to make abrupt policy changes based on short-term swings in consumer prices.
Esther George, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, the host of the conference, has been intrigued by the weak lending to small and midsize businesses in recent years, even amid an economic recovery. She and her staff have explored whether the increasing concentration of the banking industry among a handful of giants might be a cause.
"Looking at the size and footprint of firms has not been mainstream," Ms. George said, "but it appears to be very broad-based and a signal of something worth taking seriously."
For example, more of the investment of modern corporations takes the form of intangible capital, like software and patents, rather than machines and other physical goods. That may be a reason low interest rate policies by central banks over the past decade didn't prompt more capital spending, said Nicolas Crouzet and Janice Eberly of Northwestern University in a paper presented at the conference.
Banks are generally disinclined to treat intellectual property or other intangible items as collateral against loans, which could mean interest rate cuts by a central bank have less power to generate increased investment spending.
Alan Krueger, a Princeton economist, argued that monopsony power is most likely part of the apparent puzzle of why wage growth is low. By his estimates, wages should be rising 1 to 1.5 percentage points faster than they are, given recent inflation levels and the unemployment rate.
When workers have few potential employers to choose from, he said, they may have less ability to demand higher pay, and it becomes easier for employers to collude to restrict pay, whether through explicit back-room deals or more subtle signaling.
But he said monetary policy might have some power to reduce that effect. By keeping interest rates low and allowing the labor market to strengthen, employers may eventually find they have no choice but to increase worker pay. "Allowing the labor market to run hotter than otherwise could possibly cause collusion to break down," Mr. Krueger said. "If the collusion does wither, wages and employment would rise."
Another paper, by the Harvard economist Alberto Cavallo, presents evidence that the algorithms used by Amazon and other online retailers, with their constantly adjusting prices, may mean greater fluctuations in overall inflation in the event of swings in currency values or other shocks.
Physical retailers tend to be slow to change prices because of some temporary disturbance, like a spike in the value of the dollar or a fall in gasoline prices. But online retailers are able to reflect changing prices almost instantly.
"The implication is that retail prices are becoming less 'insulated' from these common nationwide shocks," Mr. Cavallo wrote. "Fuel prices, exchange-rate fluctuations or any other force affecting costs that may enter the pricing algorithms used by these firms are more likely to have a faster and larger impact on retail prices than in the past."
It's hardly the case that central bankers are becoming storm-the-barricades opponents of corporate power. Much of the discussion so far has been more about trying to understand the facts, rather than leaping to allow this emerging research to drive policy actions.
For some of the people who have argued for years that concentrated corporate power is behind many of the economy's travails, the central bankers are late to the party.
"Wage stagnation is not a puzzle," said Marshall Steinbaum, a fellow at the Roosevelt Institute, who spoke on a panel organized by the activist group Fed Up outside the lodge where the Fed symposium later took place. "Cutting-edge research tells us exactly what's going on, and yet the Fed seems to be considering this for the first time."
There is an almost tribal dimension that limits these conversations about how corporate concentration might affect the overall economy and policy. People who study industrial organization or antitrust policy are, for the most part, in a different clan from those who spend their time talking about bond yields and inflation targets.
But card-carrying members of that macroeconomic tribe are starting to see that they may have plenty to learn about some of the inner workings of the economy: the details of how businesses compete, set prices and hire people.
It helps that there is an increasingly rich vein of research based on the ability to compute huge troves of data from individual companies. For example, Mr. Cavallo's paper was based on scraping prices for 10,292 products from each of four major online retailers for delivery to each of 105 ZIP codes.
Kristin Forbes, an M.I.T. economist and a former Bank of England policymaker, faced the knotty task of setting policy for the British economy at a time when economic data was sending conflicting signals. This type of work can bring more coherence to seeming contradictions.
"We would look at macro data, but that data can hide a lot of what's happening underneath," she said. "I think there's a deepening sense of the importance of fusing microeconomic data with macroeconomic trends."
With the Federal Reserve facing the challenge of an American economy that is by many measures at a healthy cruising speed, yet still falling short in its capacity to generate well-paying jobs for millions of people, people at this particular gathering in Jackson Hole could agree that it's not enough to view the economy using high-altitude data. The details of what is happening in individual industries and markets matter a lot more than it once seemed.

Full text: "Change the world" has long been the cry of the oppressed. But in recent years world-changing has been co-opted by the rich and the powerful.
"Change the world. Improve lives. Invent something new," McKinsey & Company's recruiting materials say. "Sit back, relax, and change the world," tweets the World Economic Forum, host of the Davos conference. "Let's raise the capital that builds the things that change the world," a Morgan Stanley ad says. Walmart, recruiting a software engineer, seeks an "eagerness to change the world." Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook says, "The best thing to do now, if you want to change the world, is to start a company."
At first, you think: Rich people making a difference -- so generous! Until you consider that America might not be in the fix it's in had we not fallen for the kind of change these winners have been selling: fake change.
Fake change isn't evil; it's milquetoast. It is change the powerful can tolerate. It's the shoes or socks or tote bag you bought which promised to change the world. It's that one awesome charter school -- not equally funded public schools for all. It is Lean In Circles to empower women -- not universal preschool. It is impact investing -- not the closing of the carried-interest loophole.
Of course, world-changing initiatives funded by the winners of market capitalism do heal the sick, enrich the poor and save lives. But even as they give back, American elites generally seek to maintain the system that causes many of the problems they try to fix -- and their helpfulness is part of how they pull it off. Thus their do-gooding is an accomplice to greater, if more invisible, harm.
What their "change" leaves undisturbed is our winners-take-all economy, which siphons the gains from progress upward. The average pretax income of America's top 1 percent has more than tripled since 1980, and that of the top 0.001 percent has risen more than sevenfold, even as the average income of the bottom half of Americans stagnated around $ 16,000, adjusted for inflation, according to a paper by the economists Thomas Piketty, Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman.
American elites are monopolizing progress, and monopolies can be broken. Aggressive policies to protect workers, redistribute income, and make education and health affordable would bring real change. But such measures could also prove expensive for the winners. Which gives them a strong interest in convincing the public that they can help out within the system that so benefits the winners.
After all, if the Harvard Business School professor Michael E. Porter and his co-author Mark R. Kramer are right that "businesses acting as business, not as charitable donors, are the most powerful force for addressing the pressing issues we face," we shouldn't rein in business, should we?
This is how the winners benefit from their own kindness: It lets them redefine change, and defang it.
Consider David Rubenstein, a co-founder of the Carlyle Group, a private equity firm. He's a billionaire who practices what he calls "patriotic philanthropy." For example, when a 2011 earthquake damaged the Washington Monument and Congress funded only half of the $ 15 million repair, Mr. Rubenstein paid the rest. "The government doesn't have the resources it used to have," he explained, adding that "private citizens now need to pitch in."
That pitching-in seems generous -- until you learn that he is one of the reasons the government is strapped. He and his colleagues have long used their influence to protect the carried-interest loophole, which is enormously beneficial to people in the private equity field. Closing the loophole could give the government $ 180 billion over 10 years, enough to fix that monument thousands of times over.
Mr. Rubenstein's image could be of a man fleecing America. Do-gooding gives him a useful makeover as a patriot who interviews former presidents onstage and lectures on the 13th Amendment.
Walmart has long been accused of underpaying workers. Americans for Tax Fairness, an advocacy group, famously accused the company of costing taxpayers billions of dollars a year because it "pays its employees so little that many of them rely on food stamps, health care and other taxpayer-funded programs." Walmart denies this criticism, citing the jobs it creates and the taxes it pays.
When a column critical of Walmart ran in this newspaper some years ago, David Tovar, a Walmart spokesman, published a red-penned edit of the piece on a company blog. Beside a paragraph about how cutthroat business practices had earned the heirs of the Walton family at least $ 150 billion in wealth, Mr. Tovar wrote: "Possible addition: Largest corporate foundation in America. Gives more than $ 1 billion in cash and in kind donations each year."
Mr. Tovar wasn't denying the $ 150 billion in wealth, or that more of it could have been paid as wages. Rather, he seemed to suggest that charity made up for these facts.
A few years ago, some entrepreneurs in Oakland, Calif., founded a company called Even. Its initial plan was to help stabilize the highly volatile incomes of working-class Americans -- with an app. For a few dollars a week, it would squirrel away your money when you were flush and give you a boost when you were short. "If you want to feel like you have a safety net for the first time in your life, Even is the answer," the company proclaimed.
The rub against such an idea isn't just that it's a drop in the bucket. It's also that it dilutes our idea of change. It casts an app and a safety net as the same.
Fake change, and what it allows to fester, paved the road for President Trump. He tapped into a feeling that the American system was rigged and that establishment elites were in it for themselves. Then, darkly, he deflected that anger onto the most vulnerable Americans. And having benefited from the hollowness of fake change, he became it -- a rich man who styles himself as the ablest protector of the underdogs, who pretends that his interests have nothing to do with the changes he seeks.
President Trump is what we get when we trust the rich to fix what they are complicit in breaking.
In 2016, Mr. Trump and many of the world-changing elite leaders I am writing about were, for the most part, on opposite sides. Yet those elites and the president have one thing in common: a belief that the world should be changed by them, for the rest of us, not by us. They doubt the American creed of self-government.
A successful society is a progress machine, turning innovations and fortuitous developments into shared advancement. America's machine is broken. Innovations fly at us, but progress eludes us. A thousand world-changing initiatives won't change that. Instead, we must reform the basic systems that allow people to live decently -- the systems that decide what kind of school children attend, whether politicians listen to donors or citizens, whether or not people can tend to their ailments, whether they are paid enough, and with sufficient reliability, to make plans and raise kids.
There are a significant number of winners who recognize their role in propping up a bad system. They might be convinced that solving problems for all, at the root, will mean higher taxes, smaller profits and fewer homes. Changing the world asks more than giving back. It also takes giving something up.

Full text: The economy has come a long way from the dark days of 2008, when the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the bailout of big banks led to worldwide economic disaster. For much of the last decade, the economy has been growing and the stock market has been rising. But this steady climb is lulling bankers, lawmakers and regulators into repeating mistakes that contributed to that crisis and cost millions of people their jobs, homes and savings.
The financial system and economy are clearly on much firmer ground than they were a decade ago. Wages are barely keeping up with inflation, but the unemployment rate, which climbed as high as 10 percent, has fallen to 3.9 percent. The housing market, once crippled by foreclosures, has sprung back to life, with home prices scaling new heights in many parts of the country. Banks, once dependent on taxpayer dollars to keep their doors open, are raking in profits.
Much of the credit for the recovery belongs to the swift response from the Obama administration, the Federal Reserve and Congress. Lawmakers and President Barack Obama worked to stimulate the economy by nearly $ 1 trillion. The Fed pumped life into the financial system by lowering interest rates, buying bonds and rescuing institutions like the American International Group, which had insured financially compromised banks. Congress enacted the Dodd-Frank law, imposing tighter regulations on financial institutions and limiting their ability to take bet-the-farm risks with borrowed money. The law helped instill confidence in banks that had squandered their credibility by blowing billions on dubiously engineered investments that few understood and fewer could explain in plain English. It also created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which defended consumers from predatory businesses. And Congress and Mr. Obama extended health insurance to 20 million people with the Affordable Care Act, protecting vulnerable families from crushing medical bills.
Yet the economy has still not fully recovered. The per capita gross domestic product of the United States is about $ 70,000 smaller over the average person's lifetime than it would have been had the economy stayed on the trajectory it had been on before the crisis, according to a recent analysis published by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. The authors of that report -- Regis Barnichon, Christian Matthes and Alexander Ziegenbein -- conclude that the economy is "unlikely to regain" that lost ground, a stunning acknowledgment of the permanent and significant costs of avoidable financial crises.
Of course, averages obscure a lot. Americans have not shared equally in the losses from the crisis. Families of modest means have far fewer, or in many cases zero, assets; they may have lost their homes and their savings. The average family of three earning less than $ 42,500 a year saw its net worth chopped nearly in half, to $ 10,800 in 2016, from $ 18,500 in 2007, the Pew Research Center found. Wealth of families earning $ 42,500 to $ 127,600 fell by nearly a third, to $ 110,100. Yet, the wealth of affluent families who earn more than $ 127,600 jumped nearly 10 percent, to $ 810,800.
The crisis and the government response to it worsened longer-term trends that have caused wages to stagnate for most families while rewarding the top 1 percent with an ever-bigger slice of the economic pie. Obama officials and Congress clearly made a big mistake early in the recession by focusing more intently on saving banks -- and, thus, bankers and investors -- and much less on directly helping families facing foreclosures and layoffs. Later in the recovery, the decision by Republican leaders in Congress to oppose every Obama proposal prevented the government from doing much to help people regain what they had lost or to heat up the tepid recovery with infrastructure spending and other stimulus measures.
Before the crisis, the share of economic output that went to workers had been falling steadily since early 2001, when it stood at 64 percent. After the crisis it plunged to about 56 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, rising only slightly in the last few years.
This is because as workers' incomes have stalled, corporate profits have shot up, especially for a small number of what some experts call "superstar firms," including technology giants like Apple; Alphabet, which owns Google; and Facebook.
As a few big companies with relatively few employees amass greater market power and profits, less is left over for workers, according to a 2017 working paper by economists from M.I.T., Harvard and the University of Zurich.
As a candidate, Donald Trump spoke about getting tough on Wall Street, fighting corporate consolidation and looking out for "forgotten men and women" -- rhetoric that won him the support of some working-class voters who had backed Mr. Obama. But he and his fellow Republicans in Congress have governed like conventional far-right conservatives -- going easy on Wall Street, doing little about corporate consolidation, bolstering corporate profits and gutting a range of protections for those "forgotten men and women."
Last year, Republicans claimed their biggest legislative victory of the Trump era, reducing federal revenue by $ 1.5 trillion over 10 years by slashing taxes on corporations and wealthy families. The legislation provides generous and permanent tax cuts to rich people in the investor class, including foreigners who own stock in American businesses. Working-class families, by contrast, received minor savings that are set to automatically vanish after 2025. The tax law will widen income inequality and encourage financial excesses by overstimulating an economy that is already nine years into a recovery.
Consider the stock market, which has shot up after the tax cut was enacted; the S.&P. 500 stock index closed at a new high on Friday. Many analysts argue that the market is not overvalued and has room to run -- comments eerily similar to what Wall Street's salesmen were saying in 2007 and 2008. Yet, the market appears to be more overvalued now than it was before the crisis, according to an indicator created by Robert Shiller, the Yale economist who won a Nobel Prize for his work on bubbles in the stock and real estate markets. His data show that the S.&.P 500 stock index has an adjusted price-to-earnings ratio of 32.29, which indicates that investors are willing to pay $ 32.29 for $ 1 of corporate profits. In 2007 and 2008, that ratio never reached 28.
Lawmakers and the administration, and even the Federal Reserve, which should know better, are also sowing the seeds for another crisis by unraveling the financial regulations put in place in the last 10 years. In May, Congress voted to roll back parts of the Dodd-Frank law by exempting banks with assets of up to $ 250 billion, up from $ 50 billion, from stricter federal oversight. This was supposedly done to help smaller, community banks, but the change was so sweeping that it would leave fewer than 10 big banks under the kind of supervision many independent experts concluded was necessary after the crisis.
In addition, officials at the Fed and other government agencies have proposed relaxing the Volcker Rule, named for the former Fed chairman Paul Volcker, which restricts big banks from gambling with their depositors' money on high-risk investments. The regulators also want to ease capital requirements for banks, which will increase profits for the likes of Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase by letting them operate with more borrowed money rather than capital raised from shareholders. Last year, federal regulators decided that A.I.G. is no longer a systematically important financial institution, freeing it from the tighter government scrutiny applied to businesses whose collapse could set off a chain reaction of failures. While A.I.G. is smaller than it was in 2008, when it nearly toppled many big banks, it is still a very big domino in the financial system.
Wait, there's more. Mr. Trump has effectively neutered the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau by handing control of it temporarily to his budget chief, Mick Mulvaney, who has done the bidding of big banks as a bureaucrat and when he was a House member. He has stopped new investigations by the bureau and watered down penalties against lenders accused of preying on borrowers, to the point that the penalties are meaningless. Recently Mr. Trump appointed Kathy Kraninger, who has little experience in consumer finance, as the permanent head of the bureau.
The speed with which officials are moving to undo financial regulations is stunning to economists who remember their history. "The last time we regulated in the 1930s, it took us 30 or 40 years to take off those regulations," said Raghuram Rajan, an economist at the University of Chicago and former governor of the Reserve Bank of India. "This time we are doing it in 10 years."
And the regulations that were dismantled and eliminated could have helped prevent or reduce the severity of the last crash. Mr. Rajan, who was prescient in warning about the last crisis, said it's unwise to deregulate now because businesses and individuals have borrowed a lot of money in recent years in the United States and other countries, raising the risks of economic problems down the road.
With investors bidding up stock prices and pouring billions of dollars into money-losing start-ups as if nothing could go wrong, it is all the more frightening and infuriating that officials have so quickly tossed aside the lessons from the last crisis. In making life grander for the most comfortable Americans, the government is putting everyone's economic prospects at greater risk.

Full text: Erkal Aykac spent more than three decades showing Western tourists his beloved Turkey, meeting cruise ships in various ports, and shepherding groups through Hagia Sophia Church Museum and other ancient treasures in Istanbul.
With four university degrees and speaking fluent English, he made enough for a comfortable life in Istanbul. He sent his daughter to boarding school, and handled the medical bills for his aging father. But the past three years have hit him hard, and with Turkey now facing an all-out economic crisis, he is bracing for the worst.
The Turkish lira has dropped 35 percent over the past year, and tariffs recently announced by the Trump administration don't bode well for the troubled currency. Though the lira has fluctuated in recent days, at one point it hit record lows against the United States dollar, setting off a panic over a potential domino effect that could reach other emerging markets.
It was more bad news for a country that had only just begun to rebound from a horrific period of terrorism, including the June 2016 shooting-and-bombing attack at Ataturk International Airport that claimed 45 lives, and the March 2016 suicide attack on Istanbul's Istikal Street in the city's shopping district.
The wave of attacks crippled the nation's tourism sector, and a bloody failed coup against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his government in July 2016, followed by a widespread crackdown, political instability and diplomatic rows with the United States, Germany and the Netherlands, all served to further alarm potential Western visitors. Tourism from the United States dipped more than 40 percent from 2015 to 2017, part of a plunge that saw visitor numbers to the country sag about 30 percent.
In May, the Turkish Ministry of Culture and Tourism announced that visitor numbers were rebounding in 2018 -- although the face of tourism to the Anatolian Peninsula looks decidedly different. Into the vacuum have come more and more holidaymakers from Russia, Asia and the Middle East, who have found Turkey -- with its battered economy and cultural bounty -- a newly affordable destination.
Indeed, the exchange rate might lure some visitors. Even before the recent crisis, the average rate for a hotel room in Turkey in April 2017 stood at 67.4 euro, still a long ways off from its average of April 2015, which stood at 105 euro.
Firuz B. Baglikaya, the president of the Association of Turkish Travel Agencies, said that tourism growth over the past year has broken all records, and he is optimistic about continued growth from all parts of the world, including Europe.
"We are utterly pleased to see tangible improvement in all source markets," he said. "We are expecting a record number of visitors this year. I am quite certain that we will reach the target of 40 million with $ 32 billion revenue by the end of the year, unless developments beyond our control have a negative deteriorating impact."
The steady pace of new visitors has kept the hotel industry in Turkey chugging along, with the Hotel Association of Turkey reporting occupancy rates in 2017 spiking over 2016, in large part thanks to the changing demographic of visitors. The Hilton Hotel group, which has 90 properties either open in Turkey or in the works across its Hilton, Conrad, Hilton Garden Inn, Doubletree and Hampton brands, reported a 62 percent rise in the number of rooms occupied by guests from Iran and nations in the Persian Gulf alone.
The influx has also given the luxury market a push; in coastal resort towns like Antalya, on the nation's Turquoise Coast, and Bodrum, which Homer called the Land of the Eternal Blue, the pace of high-end development is impressive. In Bodrum alone, the past three years have seen the opening of a Lux, a Nikki Beach and the Bodrum Edition, a boutique from Marriott and the Studio 54 co-founder Ian Schrager. A Banyan Tree, a Four Seasons and the first Hyatt Centric resort in Turkey are scheduled to join the pack in the coming years. Most of the coastal resorts offer packages geared toward Arab and Russian visitors, as well as programs for medical tourists.
But Westerners with business ties to Turkey warn that the weak Turkish economy will take its toll. Marcus Moufarrige, the chief executive officer of Servcorp, a multinational office-space provider with properties in Turkey, said that this week, as the Turkish lira crisis unfolded, that he put the brakes on a real estate deal because the landlord refused to accept Turkish lira for payment, insisting on only United States dollars. Turkey may have been able to rebound from terrorism, he said, but economic woes can pose a much greater risk for business.
"If you look historically at emerging markets, the geopolitical situation hasn't alway been the biggest deterrent [for investment], unless there are sanctions in place," said Mr. Moufarrige, who steered Servcorp's Asian operations through political crises in Malaysia and Thailand. "It's really only when the economy hits the fan that people get spooked."
In the short term, some Europeans are jumping at the chance to travel to Turkey. The lure of a bargain break has already pushed up numbers this month from Britain, with direct flights between Turkey and Britain now selling at nearly the same rate as 2015. And those new tourists are following the path of the Russian, Arab and Asian tourists who prefer inclusive resorts and prepaid group trips.
"The tourism industry here has completely changed," Mr. Aykac, the tour guide, said. "For the past two years, I haven't received a single call for business from my ordinary clients." To make ends meet, Mr. Aykac has begun working with Taiwanese groups, partnering with an English-speaking Taiwanese guide who translates his notes into Chinese. The double translation creates a barrier between himself and his tourists, Mr. Aykac said. "It's almost like two blind guys conversing with each other," he said.
While many Americans have hesitated to return, visitors from Iran and elsewhere have poured into the country. In 2017, 2.5 million Farsi-speaking tourists arrived in Turkey, a 50 percent increase over the previous year. Turkey shares a 310-mile land border with Iran, and on June 18, train service from the northwestern Iranian city of Tabriz resumed to the Turkish border town of Van after being halted three years ago following a bomb attack.
And the increasing numbers of visitors from Kuwait, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia has resulted in wider availability of halal food and Farsi- and Arab-language menus.
"In Istanbul, a vast number of shops, restaurants and cafes have opened up that cater specifically to Middle Eastern tourists," said Paul Osterlund, a New Mexico native who has worked as a journalist in Istanbul for five years.
And while the sights and inexpensive shopping in Turkey are part of the appeal for this new sector, it's the nation's relaxed attitudes toward alcohol and female dress that make it a particularly appealing getaway for Muslim visitors who want to let loose. Middle Eastern medical tourists -- particularly those in search of cut-rate hair transplant surgeries -- are also realizing that Turkish doctors offer procedures at attractive prices.
But whether or not the cafes and shops are full, Turkey feels irrevocably changed, said Mr. Osterlund. "The sporadic violence and horror of 2016 is gone, [but] the air remains thick with political tension," he said.
For guides who cater specifically to English-speaking tourists, times remain tough. Ansel Mullins co-founded Culinary Backstreets, his now-global gastronomic tour company, from Istanbul in 2009. The company (which employs Mr. Osterlund as a freelance writer) now runs English-language food tours in 13 international cities, but Mr. Mullins said that interest in his Istanbul offering fell 80 percent from 2015 to 2016. Numbers are creeping back up in 2018, but have yet to fully rebound. Tour groups as a whole from Western nations are not returning to Turkey yet, he said.
Independent travelers are, though, and they seem less concerned about the nation's political alliances. Mr. Mullins draws a comparison to Egypt, another nation that has suffered terrorism and government instability. "There are places that have timeless beauty, and that can often trump who's in power."
For Mr. Aykac, however, that uptick may not come soon enough. Frustrated by a lack of work, and rising inflation, he plans to leave Istanbul in the next few years. But he'll stay in Turkey, he said. "Turkey is the highlight of all the countries in the world," he said. "You can find anything here. But with the political situation and the economics, we are releasing every last knot in our belts. We are now coming down to the last hole, and it's unbearable."

Basking in a Sweet Spot, Markets Disregard Turmoil

Full text: For much of the year, the stock market has been on the ropes. Trade wars have erupted, the Federal Reserve raised rates, emerging market currencies collapsed, and major technology firms faced regulatory scrutiny -- and, in the case of Amazon, presidential broadsides via messages on Twitter. Investors quailed at times, sending stocks down by as much as 10 percent.
But the nine-year-old bull market never completely crumbled. By April, stocks had started a fresh climb. And after a 0.6 percent rise on Friday, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed at a record high of 2,874.69 points, reflecting investor faith in a single fundamental fact: Big American companies are making lots of money.
"We've had record earnings growth, we've had record numbers of earnings and sales beats," said Savita Subramanian, chief United States equity strategist for Bank of America Merrill Lynch. "Basically the fundamentals couldn't look better."
Because owners of stock are entitled to a share of the money a company makes, corporate profits are a key ingredient of stock market rallies. And profits for companies in the S. &P. 500 were up roughly 25 percent in the second quarter, after a surge of 27 percent in the first quarter, according to data from Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
About 80 percent of companies reported results that were better than Wall Street analysts expected. (In a typical quarter, some 64 percent of companies outperform the analysts' predictions.) This year's crop of quarterly earnings has been the best since 2010, when the American economy was just emerging from the recession that ended the previous year, making big leaps in annual profit growth much easier.
The current rosy profit picture shouldn't be surprising. The Trump administration's deep tax cuts that went into effect in January reduced corporate tax expenses sharply and raised profitability almost automatically. But other metrics -- such as sales growing at an annual rate of more than 9 percent in the second quarter -- suggest that corporate America is riding a robust American economy. The unemployment rate is near 18-year lows. Gross domestic product expanded by 4.1 percent in the second quarter, the fastest pace since 2014.
"It's a 3-percent-plus growth world, and that's because the fundamentals underlying consumer spending, underlying business spending, underlying our manufacturing sector are in superb shape," said Allen Sinai, chief economist at Decision Economics, a consulting firm.
Since the bulk of companies began reporting their quarterly results in July, that upward economic pressure has erupted in gushers of profits, especially at some of the giant technology-centered firms that have been hugely influential in determining how the stock markets move.
Amazon reported a $2.53 billion quarterly profit, its largest ever. Microsoft notched $8.87 billion in earnings, beating estimates. Apple's quarterly profit jumped 32 percent to $11.52 billion, beating Wall Street expectations and pushing the company's market value above $1 trillion, a milestone that no American company had ever reached before.
The earnings boom has also reached far beyond tech. Earnings at financial firms jumped more than 27 percent. Quarterly profits at industrial companies rose 20 percent.
Even the retail sector, which has been squeezed by online competition and soft prices in recent years, is enjoying a respite. Home Depot raised earnings and sales targets for the year. Walmart reported better-than-expected earnings, including a 40 percent rise in online sales in the United States. And Target said quarterly sales at stores it had previously opened rose at the fastest pace in 13 years, sending its stock to a record high.
There could be more market gains to come. From the bargain hunter's perspective, the combination of blockbuster profits and a prolonged stock market soft patch for much of the year, means that stocks -- compared to their earnings -- are significantly cheaper than they were earlier this year.
A key valuation measure, the price of the S. & P. 500 index compared with analyst estimates for corporate earnings over the next 12 months, has fallen this year. Some observers see that as a positive sign, indicating that the rising market over the last few months has been fueled by solid earnings growth, rather than wild optimism by stock market investors.
On the other hand, the stock market is by no means dirt cheap, as it was in the aftermath of the financial crisis. And there are plenty of risks that could still derail the recent rally, from disorderly decline of some emerging markets, such as Turkey, to the continuing fallout from trade tensions between the United States and other large economies.
"The big talk on the street is obviously trade and China," said Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, head of United States equity strategy at J. P. Morgan Securities.
On the other hand, Mr. Lakos-Bujas thinks that a resolution of the trade fight between the world's two largest economies, could generate a pop in the stock market, by removing a risky overhang clouding an otherwise bright picture. The American economy, he says, is in something of a sweet spot, with strong growth, low unemployment, low inflation and high corporate profits.
"In this kind of environment, generally, risk assets such as equities, they tend to do well," he said.

Full text: At El Pampero psychiatric hospital in Barquisimeto, Venezuela, barely any drugs were available to control the afflictions tormenting patients.
People with schizophrenia were locked into isolation cells and tied to beds during psychotic episodes. Food and hygiene supplies were in short supply. Eleven patients starved to death.
"May God have mercy on us," said Evila García, the head nurse, whom I met as part of a yearslong exploration of the economic crisis that has engulfed Venezuela.
Though the country has the largest known oil reserves in the world, years of government corruption and failed economic policy have plunged it into chaos. Venezuelans now scrounge for food and medicine, and struggle to survive amid strict water and electricity rationing, soaring violent crime and government repression.
Public hospitals like El Pampero have been crippled by the shortages: More than 85 percent of medicines are either impossible or very difficult to purchase. Hundreds of children have starved to death, and thousands more are severely malnourished.
Hundreds of thousands of people have taken to the streets to voice their outrage. Riots have convulsed the country, with people setting government buildings on fire and looting grocery stores until shelves were bare.
Despite the shortages, President Nicolás Maduro refuses to accept international aid; he has denied responsibility for the crisis and vowed to continue using force against those who dare oppose him.
I regularly take a motorbike out before dawn to photograph queues of people outside grocery stores and pharmacies. The lines snake through the streets, and people wait for 10 hours or more to buy coffee, rice or butter.
Inflation rose more than 2,600 percent last year, making these staples unattainable even for fully employed professionals. In one poll, more than 90 percent of Venezuelans said they did not have enough money to buy all of the food they needed. Nearly three in four of those said the crisis had caused them to lose weight -- on average, nearly 20 pounds each.
Kenyerber Aquino Merchán was 17 months old when he died. He weighed just 8.8 pounds -- the size of a large newborn. Family members decorated his tiny coffin with angel wings cut out from a government food-ration box.
When I returned to visit the family six weeks later, the only food in the house was a single lime and half a bag of salt.
Kenyerber's mother, María Carolina Merchán, had wilted to 66 pounds by skipping meals so that her four surviving children would not have to. She worried that her 6-year-old daughter, Marianyerlis, would follow her brother into the grave.
"I close myself in my bedroom to cry and cry because the children have not eaten," Ms. Merchán said, "and there is nothing I can do about it."

WASHINGTON -- How much economic damage will global warming cause? That's one of the key questions embedded in the Trump administration's recent proposals to weaken Obama-era regulations on greenhouse gas emissions from both vehicles and power plants.
When federal agencies calculate the costs and benefits of climate regulations, they use a figure called the "social cost of carbon," an estimate of the harm caused by releasing more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and increasing global warming.
In its rollback proposals, the Trump administration argued that each ton of carbon dioxide emitted by a car or a coal plant in 2020 would only cause around $1 to $7 in economic damages. That's far lower than the Obama administration's central estimate, which, after adjusting for inflation, argued that same ton of carbon dioxide would cause roughly $50 in total damages.
That change will make a big difference for the cost-benefit analyses that agencies are required to conduct for new rules. If the Trump administration can successfully claim that carbon dioxide causes relatively little harm to the economy, then it can more easily justify moves like replacing the Clean Power Plan, an ambitious Obama-era program to cut pollution from coal plants, with a less-stringent rule.
So how did the Trump administration conclude that global warming will be much less costly than the Obama administration assumed?
First, the Environmental Protection Agency focused solely on damages from climate change that would occur within the borders of the United States rather than across the entire globe. Second, they used calculations that put less weight on the harm climate change could inflict on future generations.
Trump officials contend that their carbon approach better reflects the way the government has traditionally done cost-benefit analyses. Critics argue that this approach is inappropriate for global, multigenerational problems like climate change, and that newer research suggests the social cost of carbon may be even higher than the Obama administration estimated, not much lower.
Ultimately, the courts could decide which view prevails. "This will be part of the legal challenges to these regulatory rollbacks," said Richard L. Revesz, an expert in environmental law at New York University. "The reasons for why the Trump administration picked these numbers for the social cost of carbon are going to be scrutinized."
Tallying the costs of climate change
Predicting the costs of climate change is a maddeningly complex task, one that has bedeviled economists for years. They have to grapple with uncertainty around population growth, future levels of emissions, the effect of those emissions on the Earth's climate and the economic turmoil that higher temperatures could create.
In 2009, the Obama administration brought 12 federal agencies together to hash out a best estimate of the social cost of carbon. They based their answer on three widely used academic models that tried to quantify the harm to things like human health and coastal property as heat waves increased and sea-levels rose.
These models produce a wide range of estimates. But in 2016, the Obama administration recommended that federal agencies use a central estimate that, in current dollars, pegged the damage from a ton of carbon dioxide emitted in 2020 at around $50 per ton, rising over time.
At the time, some researchers and environmentalists criticized the Obama number for being incomplete. It did not, for example, fully account for many plausible climate impacts like damage from increased wildfires or the loss of diverse ecosystems. In one survey of climate economists from 2015, 51 percent of respondents said the number was probably too low. Only 9 percent said it was probably too high.
The Trump administration's new numbers
When President Trump came to office, he disbanded the interagency team working on this issue. Instead, the E.P.A. under Scott Pruitt came up with its own "interim" estimate of the social cost of carbon.
First, the E.P.A. took the Obama-era models and focused solely on damages that occurred within the borders of the United States, rather than looking at harm to other countries as well. That change alone reduced the social cost of carbon estimate to around $7 per ton.
The reasoning was simple: If Americans are paying the cost of these rules to mitigate climate change, then only benefits that accrue to Americans themselves should be counted.
Critics counter that this approach overlooks two key points. First, many of those climate impacts in other countries could indirectly hurt the United States, say, by roiling the global economy or by increasing the number of refugees. Second, climate change can only be solved by all countries working together. If the United States refused to consider the impacts of its emissions on other countries, other countries could respond in kind.
"The United States is only 14 percent of global emissions, which means that 86 percent of the damages we face will be caused by emissions from other countries," said Richard G. Newell, president of Resources for the Future, an environmental economics think tank. "If we took this domestic-only approach to its logical conclusion, that means other countries should not worry about their impacts on us."
Next, the E.P.A. lowered its estimate of the social cost of carbon further by rethinking how it used an economic concept known as the discount rate.
The discount rate is how economists value costs and benefits across time. People tend to value a dollar today more than a dollar in the future (a dollar today could be invested in the stock market and gain value, for example). The question is how much that future dollar should be discounted. A higher discount rate implies we shouldn't pay as much today to avoid harms far in the future, which, in turn, produces a lower social cost of carbon.
The federal government has long recommended discount rates of 3 percent and 7 percent for valuing costs and benefits across a single generation. But some economists have argued that higher rates are inappropriate for thinking about long-range problems like global warming, where today's emissions can have impacts, like melting ice sheets, that reverberate for centuries.
"If you use a rate above 5 percent, you're essentially saying that we shouldn't worry today about anything that happens 100 years from now," said Maureen Cropper, an economist at the University of Maryland.
The Obama administration opted for lower rates of 2.5 percent, 3 percent, and 5 percent when thinking about climate change. But the Trump administration has returned to the practice of using 3 percent and 7 percent. That higher rate further reduces the social cost of carbon down to $1 per ton.
Arguing in court
The Trump administration may not be finished adjusting the social cost of carbon. In earlier proposals, the E.P.A. said "improved domestic estimates" could be developed in the future.
Most experts agree that the social cost of carbon can be improved by taking into account newer scientific and economic research. "There's been an explosion of research on the impacts of climate change in recent years, and it hasn't been fully reflected in the estimates," said Michael Greenstone, an economist at the University of Chicago who helped craft the Obama administration's original numbers.
Dr. Greenstone was an author of a recent paper that looked more carefully at projected heat deaths from global warming as well as the costs of adapting to higher temperatures, such as buying more air-conditioners. That study concluded that these new estimates could add significantly to the social cost of carbon.
Yet some influential conservative groups, like the Heritage Foundation, have made the opposite case: that the Obama numbers were too high, emphasizing studies that suggest a slower rate of future warming and arguing that it is misguided to focus on damages that will occur centuries from now, when the American economy may look radically different.
Whatever number the Trump administration ultimately comes up with, they will have to defend it in court. Once the proposed rollbacks of vehicle and power plant rules are finalized, environmental groups and states like California plan to sue, including on the process that the administration used to tally costs and benefits.
"Typically, an agency gets some latitude to set standards a bit more or less stringently," said Jody Freeman, director of the environmental law program at Harvard Law School. "But if you can show the agency to be glaringly wrong in its analysis -- they ignore obvious counterarguments, they cherry-pick the data to support their outcome, they make numbers up -- you can get a court to strike the standards down."

Full text: It may be time for a gut check.
On Wednesday, the decade-long bull market that keeps rolling became, by one measure, the longest such run in United States history.
For many investors, that raises a reasonable question: Should I be taking some money off the table?
The answer is the same as it always has been: If you have a well-constructed financial strategy, and your personal circumstances haven't really changed since you put it in place, there is probably no reason to do anything at all.
If, however, you think you will be tempted to unload a chunk of your stocks should the market tumble sharply, then a new plan or tweaks to the one you already have could make sense.
"Many people feel that they only have two options: Invest or not invest," said Nicholas Scheibner, a financial planner with Baron Financial Group. "However, you have a third option -- adjust."
There are some glaringly obvious facts that bear repeating. Your investment portfolio is not the stock market -- at least it shouldn't be, unless you're 22, just starting out and have only 10 percent of your money allocated to a more stable investment category like bond funds. If the market plunges, your portfolio, if spread across a diversified mix of stocks and bonds, should not necessarily drop in tandem.
During its last big downturn, in 2008 and 2009, the stock market plummeted roughly 50 percent. An investment portfolio evenly divided between stocks and bonds would have lost nearly 29 percent of its value in that time, but it would have taken only about a year to recover, according to an analysis by Vanguard. A portfolio that was 100 percent stocks -- and lost about 55 percent -- would have taken about three years to recoup its losses.
Still, even the most rational investors among us -- particularly those who need to tap into their portfolio within the next few years, for college tuition, buying a home or retirement -- may feel a need to satisfy that itch to do something now that the market has reached such a lofty level.
But what? Here are five ideas:
Take the stomach-acid test
Your tolerance for risky investments, including stocks, should be built into your overall approach from the start. But circumstances and needs can shift over time. So it's worth considering whether your tolerance has changed, not with respect to the perceived level of the market itself, but in terms of what sort of drop you could tolerate, regardless of current market conditions. How did you feel during the market plunge 10 years ago? How did you react?
"If a 30 percent drop in the stock market would cause a loss in a portfolio that the investor knows they cannot stomach, they have too much exposure to stocks," said Doug Bellfy, a financial planner in South Glastonbury, Conn. "But this test is valid, regardless of where the experts think the market is at any given time or guess it will be in the near future -- and it is a guess."
Consider how much risk your plans require
Responsible financial advisers have a mantra: Don't take on more risk than is necessary to reach your goals, whether it's the amount of money you think you need for retirement or for your child's tuition.
"For many who have invested wisely over the last 10 year bull market, they no longer need to be heavily invested in stocks," said James Sweeney, a financial planner in Lehi, Utah. "Their portfolio has grown to the point that they can reduce the risk and still meet their retirement goals."
That might mean slightly scaling back the slice of a portfolio allocated to stocks based on individual circumstances. The percentage won't be the same for everyone, and it's a delicate balance: You don't, for example, want to become invested too conservatively as you approach retirement; your portfolio might need to last three decades or more. That means you'll need enough stocks to help your money grow and keep pace with inflation.
Move to cash as needed
If you have an imminent need for cash but your money is tied up in stocks, now might be a good time to shift into something conservative, particularly if the need is likely to arise in five years or less. If you expect to buy a home in that time, you'll need all that money at once. If you're paying a tuition bill, you'll probably only need a quarter of your savings a year over four years.
"The more concentrated the outflow, the more important it is not to have your money at risk to satisfy near-term goals," Mr. Bellfy said.
Retirees and people on the cusp of retirement have the most to lose if the markets come tumbling down. In such circumstances, keeping a year's worth of basic living expenses in cash may be helpful as a long-term strategy. It can keep retirees from locking in losses by having to sell investments when they are down.
Alex Doll, president of Anfield Wealth Management, said he suggests that retirees determine how much they need to cover expenses for the next six to nine months, and how much would come from their portfolio to augment other income, like Social Security or a pension. This usually amounts to about 2 percent of a portfolio, which Mr. Doll said is generally not enough to derail a larger retirement strategy.
"This helps clients mentally as they know that their spending for the next six to nine months is safe in cash no matter what happens to the market," he said.
Protect the gains you've already made
If a financial professional or an automatic service isn't already performing regular maintenance on your portfolio, now may be a good time to do it yourself. As markets rise and fall, the mix of investments you originally put into place can take a different shape. A portfolio that was supposed to be composed of 50 percent stocks may now have 55 percent.
To protect your gains, investors should consider selling investments that have ballooned beyond their initial target and reinvest the proceeds into the side of the portfolio that has shrunk, relatively speaking. Rebalancing is counterintuitive -- selling winners, buying losers -- but it helps rein in the amount of risk you are taking on.
Control what you can
Since most of us aren't in a position to determine precisely when the mood of the markets will shift, it pays to focus on the things we can control: how much we spend, how much we save and what we pay for our investments, which is easier than ever to do.
"There's a lot to be said for doing a 'financial checkup,"' said Milo Benningfield, a financial planner in San Francisco, "both to uncover financial gaps and to rest easier knowing you've addressed everything in your control."

Full text: Federal Reserve officials are poised to continue gradually raising interest rates but are monitoring for signs of widespread economic fallout from President Trump's trade policies, according to minutes from the most recent Fed meeting released on Wednesday.
The Fed minutes suggest that officials are concerned that Mr. Trump's tariffs could hurt the current economic recovery but are waiting to see evidence of any damage in the data. Fed officials are also increasingly worried that trouble is brewing in the residential construction market, based on a recent slowdown in home building.
For now, however, the Fed shows no signs of deviating from its current path to return interest rates to more historically normal levels, despite Mr. Trump's recent calls for the central bank to stop raising interest rates.
Several officials hinted in the minutes that they are preparing to remove a hallmark phrase of the last decade, one that has indicated the Fed intends to provide support for the economy. Future Fed statements may no longer carry language reading "the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative" as rates continue to rise toward a more historically normal level and the Fed continues to wind down its post-crisis economic stimulus.
Federal Open Market Committee officials left rates unchanged after the meeting that ended Aug. 1 and laid the groundwork in their post-meeting statement to raise rates in September, the third time this year. Since mid-July, Mr. Trump has used interviews and Twitter to pressure the Fed and its chairman, Jerome H. Powell, to pause the pace of increases, which have left the Fed's target interest rate between 1.75 percent and 2 percent.
Minutes from the meeting revealed no willingness among Fed officials to grant Mr. Trump's request. Officials "indicated that information gathered since the Committee met in June had not significantly altered their outlook for the U.S. economy," the minutes reported. "Many participants suggested that if incoming data continued to support their current economic outlook, it would likely soon be appropriate to take another step in removing policy accommodation."
That's Fed-speak for "raise interest rates again" -- and the minutes note that investors are overwhelmingly convinced another rate increase is coming next month.
While the economic recovery is strong, the Fed minutes show that officials are cognizant of the disparity between slow growth in nominal wages and the strength of the labor market, but they remain largely convinced those gains are about to accelerate.
Officials were united in their concerns over the potential of Mr. Trump's trade policies to crimp economic growth. Mr. Trump has imposed tariffs levied on steel and aluminum from countries including Japan, Mexico and Canada, and additional tariffs on other imported goods from China.
"All participants pointed to ongoing trade disagreements and proposed trade measures as an important source of uncertainty and risk," the minutes reported. A prolonged trade dispute, officials said, would likely bring "adverse effects on business sentiment, investment spending and employment. Moreover, wide-ranging tariff increases would also reduce the purchasing power of U.S. households," while disrupting supply chains and reducing productivity.
But while companies are complaining about tariffs affecting them, the officials noted that "most businesses concerned about trade disputes had not yet cut back their capital expenditures or hiring but might do so if trade tensions were not resolved soon."
Other than trade, the Fed's biggest worry about the economy wasn't inflation but residential construction. Several officials noted that new home building has slowed, possibly reflecting "declining home affordability, higher mortgage rates, scarcity of available lots in certain cities and delays in building approvals." Some of their business contacts, officials said, had also complained of labor shortages in the construction sector -- and of tariff increases pushing up their cost of materials.
Officials also noted that mortgage purchases and home refinancing had also slowed. Some expressed worry over "the possibility of a significant weakening in the housing sector" -- an apparent reference to the effects of higher rates on borrowing and construction. There was no sign in the minutes that Fed officials were worried home values were in a "bubble," similar to the period before the financial crisis.
In other areas, Fed officials expressed more division.
Some officials theorized that the slow pace of wage growth -- even before accounting for inflation, which has wiped out all wage gains for nonsupervisory workers over the last year -- reflected slow productivity growth or lags in companies' responses to a tight labor market, which typically pushes employers to raise salaries when competing for workers. Others said the pace of increases suggests there is still more room for unemployment to fall before it begins to push up wages more significantly. Some officials said they expected to see improvement "before long" in part because firms in their regions were beginning to report more willingness to raise pay.
There are also continuing differences over the banking system and whether to push for even larger capital cushions given the robust economy. The minutes report officials argued for and against strengthening capital requirements for banks now, "while their profits are strong and the economic outlook is favorable" in order to better stabilize the financial system against an economic shock.

Full text: The stock market rally that kicked off more than nine years ago during the financial crisis is now arguably the longest on record in the United States.*
[*By one measure. Read about the caveats here .]
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has marched steadily higher for 3,453 days. Since bottoming out on March 9, 2009, it is up more than 320 percent.
Investors have enjoyed 11 bull markets -- defined as a period without a pullback of 20 percent or more -- since the end of World War II. Usually driven by a strengthening economy that fuels corporate profits, bull markets often end in recession after the Federal Reserve begins to raise rates to slow rising prices and cool the economy.
Here's a look at the five other longest bull markets of the past 70 years.
June 1949 to August 1956
A Peacetime Boom
GAIN: 267%
The first bull market after World War II remains one of the most impressive. With Europe a shambles, the American economy took off, producing one of the strongest expansions on record. In September 1954, the stock market finally climbed past the peak it had reached in 1929 before the Great Depression. The S.&P. 500 kept rising, even through a period that included the Korean War and President Dwight D. Eisenhower's heart attack in 1955.
In 1956, the Fed, concerned about inflation, raised interest rates. The economy cooled, and the bull market ended. The Suez Crisis and the Hungarian Revolution would help drive stocks into a bear market. But that didn't last long -- the bull returned in 1957.
October 1974 to November 1980
Inflation Lurks
GAIN: 126%
The bull market of the second half of the 1970s didn't charge so much as limp.
The early '70s saw one of the worst bear markets in history, driven by the collapse of a monetary agreement among Western nations, an oil price shock, runaway inflation and slowing economic growth. Stocks had fallen nearly 50 percent from their 1973 high. But investors became more optimistic as the Vietnam War came to a close, the social unrest of the 1960s began to simmer down and corporate profits rose.
But inflation remained high, robbing investors of much of their returns. In 1979, a tough new Fed chairman, Paul A. Volcker, finally moved to tame inflation. He raised interest rates to historically high levels, ending the bull market and helping to cause a brief recession in the early 1980s.
August 1982 to August 1987
Before Black Monday
GAIN: 229%
Not every bull market ends in a recession.
Falling interest rates, a strong economy, and a flurry of corporate mergers and public offerings fueled a bull market and the excesses of 1980s Wall Street. Even so, there were mounting concerns heading into fall 1987: The rally had pushed valuations to high levels, and the Fed, again worried about inflation, had begun to raise interest rates. Geopolitical events centered in the Persian Gulf and concerns about the trade deficit only added to investors' jitters.
Then, on Oct. 19, 1987, a day that became known as Black Monday, stocks tumbled more than 20 percent. When the selling began, it was exacerbated by computerized trading, then still in its infancy, without the so-called circuit breakers that would now halt trading during such a plunge. It remains the worst one-day crash in history by percentage.
As dark a moment as it was, the United States economy continued to grow for nearly three more years.
October 1990 to March 2000
The Dot-Com Boom
GAIN: 417%
Few thought in 1990 that stocks were about to embark on one of the most remarkable rallies ever.
The economy was sluggish, banks were saddled with bad loans and Iraq had recently invaded Kuwait, prompting the United States and its allies to send forces to the Middle East. On the day the stock market began its recovery, The New York Times quoted an analyst saying that the bear market had not run its course and that any recovery in the next couple of months would be "a temporary respite in a major downtrend."
Within months, though, Iraq had been expelled from Kuwait, and the economy had entered a period of strong and stable growth. Corporate profits ballooned, and retail investors rushed into the market. Finally, toward the end of the decade, investors' optimism morphed into the sort of "irrational exuberance" that Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman at the time, had described a few years earlier. The Fed, hoping to slow inflation, and perhaps to cool the stock market, began raising interest rates. But a series of increases were slow to quell investor enthusiasm, and the tech bubble continued to inflate -- until, eventually, it burst.
October 2002 to October 2007
The Housing Bubble
GAIN: 102%
After the dot-com crash in 2000, the Fed slashed interest rates and borrowing took off -- including among home buyers with subprime credit. Complex financial products -- like the collateralized debt obligations into which those mortgages were packaged -- soared. The balance sheets, profits and share prices of the banks that created and traded these products swelled. By 2006, the financial sector was the largest in the S.&P. 500.
But as the economy took off, the Fed began to raise the historically low interest rates. Now the borrowed money was more expensive to pay back, and defaults climbed. By the time stocks peaked in October 2007, the era of easy lending was over and banks were taking huge losses. By December, the economy had fallen into recession, and the next summer stocks entered a bear market. By October 2008, some of Wall Street's biggest financial institutions had collapsed and the federal government had begun the bailout that helped set off the current bull market.

More Wealth Has Not Made Us Happier

Full text: In 1990, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain was challenged by a Labour member of Parliament on the subject of growing inequality. "All levels of income are better off than they were in 1979," she retorted. "The honorable member is saying that he would rather that the poor were poorer, provided the rich were less rich. ... What a policy!"
That slap-down was an iconic formulation of a premise of the Thatcher-Reagan conservative revolution: Poverty is a social problem, but inequality, as such, is not. Governments should aim to increase the incomes and opportunities of all, especially the poor, but to worry about the gap between the rich and the rest is "the politics of envy."
Morally speaking, Mrs. Thatcher and Ronald Reagan should have been right. As long as I am better off, why should I begrudge your doing better still? Yet something was amiss with this consensus -- something that goes far to explain why Reagan-Thatcher conservatism has caved in under pressure from the populisms of President Trump on the right and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont on the left.
In America (and also in other countries), an impressive postwar rise in material well-being has had zero effect on personal well-being. The divergence between economic growth and subjective satisfaction began decades ago. Real per capita income has more than tripled since the late 1950s, but the percentage of people saying they are very happy has, if anything, slightly declined.
Why? Researching happiness and age, I did a deep dive into the relatively new discipline of happiness economics and emerged impressed by two findings. One is that all happiness is local. According to World Bank data, the share of the world's population living on less than $1.90 a day (inflation adjusted) declined to under 10 percent in 2015 from 44 percent in 1980, an astounding achievement.
But ordinary people's well-being depends mainly on their immediate surroundings. If you are an autoworker who loses your job in Massena, N.Y., when G.M. closes its local plant (moving some jobs to Mexico) and who spends years out of work and who watches as schools shut down and shops go dark and young people flee -- for you, the fact that America's big coastal cities are doing great, or that more than half a million Chinese have been lifted out of extreme poverty, merely rubs salt in your wounds.
Second, all happiness is relative. Although moral philosophers may wish Homo sapiens were wired more rationally, we humans are walking, talking status meters, constantly judging our worth and social standing by comparing ourselves with others today and with our own prior selves.
According to the Brookings Institution economist Carol Graham, poor whites are far more unhappy and pessimistic than poor blacks, even though, in absolute terms, they are better off. That would not make sense if absolute standing determined subjective well-being. It does make sense, however, when we look at relative standing. Less-educated whites (especially men) have seen their relative standing decline sharply, both compared with their parents and with rising nonwhites. Blacks, by contrast, have seen themselves doing better than expected and closing the economic and social gap.
Absolute standing is not irrelevant, and people will tolerate and sometimes even embrace inequality if they believe the system is fair and lets them get ahead. Still, the witticism (frequently attributed to Gore Vidal) that "it is not enough for me to succeed; others must fail" is uncomfortably accurate. In a striking experiment, certain households in Kenyan villages were randomly chosen to receive large financial windfalls. The lucky beneficiaries were pleased, of course, but their increased happiness was much more than offset by the increased unhappiness of other households, which lost nothing in absolute terms but suddenly saw themselves falling behind. Pondering the accumulated evidence, the British happiness economist Richard Layard concluded, "These studies provide clear evidence that a rise in other people's income hurts your happiness."
Inequality, in short, is immiserating. One could cite more evidence in the same vein. Places in the United States with more inequality have higher stress and worry, more political polarization and lower social connectedness, even among the wealthy. Moreover, what counts for subjective well-being is not just reality but also perception. If social media and reality TV disproportionately depict millionaires and amazing homes, or if talk-radio pundits insist that government takes from hard-working whites to subsidize lazy minorities, resentment grows, never mind what the statistics may say.
In a poor country with low inequality, rising national income should make people happier, and of course reducing poverty is a good in and of itself. But in a wealthy, unequal country like today's America, gains in national income can decouple from well-being.
"Each person would become happier because he was richer, but less happy because other people were richer," Mr. Layard writes. "The two effects would cancel each other out, because relative income would be unchanged."
Moreover, if inequality is growing (as is the case in the United States), economic growth pushes the rungs of the socioeconomic ladder farther apart even as it lifts the ladder. Because people tend to compare upward when gauging status, they perceive themselves to be losing ground.
In light of what happiness economists have had to say, the interesting question is not why the Reagan-Thatcher consensus finally failed but why it prevailed for two generations. Partly, I think, because its call to transcend envy is morally appealing, and partly because, in the 1980s and 1990s, pro-growth policies and free-market economics seemed to have turned around a troubled economy. But partly also because there was no viable alternative. Mainstream liberalism worried about inequality but offered only policies that much of the public viewed as discredited or unfair.
Now the Reagan-Thatcherist alternative has crumbled, too. In 2008, the economic meltdown made the system look rigged and ignited a populist backlash. In 2016, the backlash coalesced behind the populisms of Mr. Trump and Mr. Sanders, each of whom had a compelling story to tell those suffering from real or perceived loss of status: We will de-rig the system with radical solutions like trade wars and socialized medicine. Those may be (as I believe) wrong answers to the problem of inequality, but they are answers, and their appeal is evident.
Today it is free-market conservatism that is voiceless. After insisting for two generations that inequality does not matter, the heirs of Mr. Reagan and Mrs. Thatcher -- people like the House speaker, Paul Ryan -- have neither a coherent program to reduce inequality nor a philosophical rationale to seek one.
Like it or not, inequality in today's America drives politics toward rage and polarization, and toward destabilizing and dangerous populisms of both left and right. Trumpism and Sandersism have something to say about inequality, but mainstream conservatism does not, and it will be no match for them until it does.

Full text: Here's what to expect in the week ahead:
Trade
Hearings, new tariffs and trade talks with China.
The United States trade representative will on Monday begin six days of hearings, during which up to 370 witnesses will weigh in on the administration's plan to place tariffs on an additional $200 billion of Chinese goods. Those hearings will run through the following Monday.
Tariffs on $16 billion of Chinese goods will go into effect on Thursday, ratcheting up the price of chemicals, seafood and other goods imported from China. The measures follow tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese goods that the Trump administration imposed in July.
And after a monthslong hiatus, the United States will resume trade talks with China on Wednesday and Thursday, when the Chinese vice minister of finance, Liao Min, meets with David R. Malpass, the American under secretary for international affairs at the Treasury Department. European officials are also expected to be in Washington this week to begin exploratory talks over a potential trade agreement with the Trump administration.
-- Ana Swanson
______
ECONOMY
Greece will end a bailout program begun during the debt crisis.
Greece will reach a milestone Monday in the recovery from one of the worst financial crises to hit Europe, when the country officially ends its reliance on nearly a decade of financial bailouts that totaled over 320 billion euros, or about $360 billion. European leaders are declaring an end to a debt crisis that nearly destroyed the euro, and Greece is anticipating a new era of financial independence and growth. But years of harsh austerity and a downturn reminiscent of the Great Depression have left a legacy of poverty that now affects a third of the Greek population. While growth is slowly reviving, it will most likely be years before Greece's economy returns to normal.
-- Liz Alderman
______
Trade
The commerce secretary will visit Kentucky to extol tariffs' benefits.
Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, will head to Kentucky on Wednesday for the ceremonial restart of an aluminum smelter. The Trump administration has been under fire from American allies and many companies for imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. The visit by Mr. Ross to Century Aluminum, which plans to ramp up its production this year, is meant to underscore an example a struggling industry that the tariffs have helped get back on its feet.
-- Alan Rappeport
______
Economy
Home sales may be slowing.
The rebound of the housing market has hit a rocky patch recently, with both sales and construction activity slowing down. Economists have generally attributed the declines to supply constraints: Not enough homes are for sale, and zoning rules, among other factors, make it hard to build new ones. But lately, there have been hints that demand may be cooling as well. The real estate site Zillow recently reported that more sellers are cutting prices, and measures of sentiment among builders and sellers have been weakening. Two reports this week will help show whether the housing market continued to weaken in July. On Wednesday, the National Association of Realtors will release data on sales of previously owned homes. On Thursday, the Census Bureau will release its estimate of new home sales. Economists expect both reports to show a modest increase.
-- Ben Casselman
______
Economy
Minutes from the latest Fed meeting will be released.
The Federal Reserve on Wednesday will release minutes from its most recent meeting, which left interest rates unchanged. The minutes from the meeting held on Aug. 1 are expected to give more insight into how Fed officials are sizing up risks to the economy, including rising inflation and the threat that tariffs pose to growth.
-- Jim Tankersley
______
TECHNOLOGY
Chinese giant Alibaba will release quarterly results.
The Alibaba Group could provide a glimpse of how the Chinese consumer is weathering growing economic uncertainty. The e-commerce giant will report quarterly results on Thursday at a time when China's stock market is languishing, its currency is weakening and the trade war with the United States shows no signs of easing. A major competitor, JD.com, reported disappointing results last week.
-- Carlos Tejada
______
Economy
European Central Bank will release a summary of its policy meeting.
The European Central Bank on Thursday will publish a summary of the discussion at its monetary policy meeting last month. The bank's Governing Council did not make any changes to policy at the meeting on July 25 and July 26. But analysts will look for clues as to whether a trade war and other risks could delay plans to begin raising interest rates late next year.
-- Jack Ewing
______
Economy
The Fed chairman will speak in Wyoming.
The Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell will speak in Jackson Hole, Wyo., on Friday morning to open the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City's annual economic symposium. The topic of the conference is "Changing Market Structure and Implications for Monetary Policy," and leading economists and central bankers will most likely be discussing how the rise of high-performing "superstar" firms may be affecting wages, inflation and other broad economic trends. The symposium concludes on Saturday.
-- Neil Irwin
______
Economy
Durable goods orders probably rose in July.
The Commerce Department will report on Friday the latest numbers for durable goods orders in July. The headline number, which includes the volatile transportation category, could drop, but core durable goods orders are expected to rise modestly. In June, orders for core durable goods were up 0.4 percent, and a generally strong industrial economy should provide additional tailwinds.
-- Nelson D. Schwartz

Full text: In Western capitals a decade ago, Turkey's now-paramount leader, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, held promise as a potential beacon of democracy for a region rife with religious conflict.
Turkey was a stalwart NATO ally bridging Europe and the volatile Middle East. As Mr. Erdogan sought to secure a place for his country in the ranks of the European Union, he presented himself as a moderate and modernizing Muslim leader for the post-9/11 age. He catered to perceptions that Turkey was becoming a liberal society governed by tolerance and the rule of law.
But that was before Mr. Erdogan began amassing supreme powers, and before his brutal crackdown on dissent following an attempted coup two years ago. It was before Turkey descended into a financial crisis delivered in no small measure by his authoritarian proclivities and unorthodox stewardship of the economy. Whatever was left of the notion that Mr. Erdogan was a liberalizing force has been wholly extinguished.
For the West, Mr. Erdogan has devolved from a righteous hope -- would-be proof that Islam and democracy can peacefully coexist -- into another autocrat whose populism, bombast and contempt for the ledger books have yielded calamity.
Regional experts contend that visions of Turkey's leader as an agent of liberal progress were always fantastical. Mr. Erdogan -- who served as Turkey's prime minister for 11 years before becoming its president in 2014 -- forged his political career as an Islamist intent on challenging the strictures of Turkey's state-imposed secularism. His early democratic reforms and assertion of civilian control over the military were largely about winning the welcome of the European bloc while enabling Turkey's Muslim populace to practice its religion free of state interference.
"For us, democracy is a means to an end," Mr. Erdogan once declared.
History is full of examples of Western nations -- especially the United States -- projecting their aspirations and values onto foreign leaders with their own objectives.
In its effort to prevent China from falling under the control of Communists, Washington backed the Chinese Nationalist general Chiang Kai-shek, celebrating him as a courageous hero even as he brutalized opponents and profited on the spoils of American support. In Vietnam, Afghanistan and elsewhere, the United States cast flawed figures as veritable George Washingtons before writing them off as corrupt tyrants.
"As much as we might fantasize about things changing and there being liberal progress, we probably got overly carried away with those sorts of visions for Turkey," said Philip Robins, a professor of Middle East politics at the University of Oxford.
Yet even inside Turkey, the European Union exerted a powerful pull as a means of elevating society. It aligned commercial interests -- access to a vast European marketplace -- with the imperative to democratize. To win European favor, Turkey abolished notorious state security courts, elevated human rights and scrapped the death penalty.
"This is a process that is going to change the perception of life in Turkish society," the then-president of the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce, Murat Yalcintas, said in 2005. "It's a mechanism that will integrate us into the freethinking, modern world."
If that was ever really so, it now looks like a lost opportunity.
Europe never got comfortable with admitting an overwhelmingly Muslim nation that is home to more than 70 million people. Repeated rebuffs laced with anti-Muslim sentiments proved galling for Turkey, especially as Bulgaria and Romania managed to join the European bloc despite reputations for rampant corruption.
In recent years, Mr. Erdogan has broken from the reformist path while forging new alliances, especially with Russia and its strongman leader Vladimir Putin. He has jailed journalists, seized the assets of political opponents and crushed dissent while amassing complete control over the levers of Turkish power. He has run the economy like a patronage network, lavishing credit on companies controlled by cronies, while yielding growth through debt.
His spending spree has bettered life for the working class Turks who make up Mr. Erdogan's political base, erecting hospitals, schools, roads and other infrastructure. But he has fueled the construction boom by supplying government credits and guarantees that have encouraged private companies to take on alarming debts.
Much of the borrowing has been conducted in American dollars. With the Turkish currency now in free-fall, those debts have multiplied. That has put the Turkish corporate realm in uncomfortable proximity to insolvency while potentially delivering a full-blown economic disaster.
The dangers were already mounting when the global financial crisis emerged in 2008, prompting the world's largest central banks to unleash an unprecedented gusher of cheap credit. They dropped interest rates to zero while purchasing bonds to make cheap money abundant.
Whatever pressure Mr. Erdogan had felt to respect the traditional limits of arithmetic was gone. Money was practically free, giving him virtually infinite supplies of cash to throw at constructing monuments to his prowess. Up went an enormous new Istanbul airport. High-rise apartment blocks filled the horizons. The jackhammer became the national soundtrack.
"This was the easy way to pump up the economy," said Jacob F. Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. "He took the money and used it for his own political purposes."
Yet in nourishing the economy with borrowed foreign money, Mr. Erdogan effectively ceded control of Turkey's fate to financiers who answered not to him but to the global marketplace.
As the Federal Reserve and other central banks have begun to lift rates in recent years, investment has flowed more slowly into emerging markets while streaming back into the United States. It has provoked troubles from Mexico to Malaysia to Turkey.
The exodus of cash from Turkey has wiped away nearly half the value of the nation's currency, the lira, over the past year. This has lifted the price of imported goods, forcing Turks to pay more for food and fuel.
"This is a classical case of populism," Mr. Kirkegaard said. "It can get you growth for some time, but there's a bill that comes due. And when the bill comes due, populists tend to get more authoritarian and oppressive."
Turkey's troubles have been worsened by other problems that are at least in part influenced by decisions made in Western capitals.
As the war in neighboring Syria spiraled into catastrophe, and as the Obama administration opted to largely stand aside, million of refugees streamed into Turkey. Europe barricaded itself against this flow, leaving Turkey to contend with a crisis. The migrants competed with lesser-skilled Turks for jobs, while placing a strain on Turkish services.
Amid the instability, Mr. Erdogan kept the taps open for public spending, accelerating growth and elevating the debt dangers.
"Clearly, the dynamics in Syria did affect the Turkish economy," said Selva Demiralp, an economist who previously worked at the Federal Reserve in Washington and now teaches at Koc University in Istanbul. "The increase in unemployment put more pressure on Erdogan to press his growth agenda and his populism."
At the same time, the United States backed Kurdish forces inside Syria to pressure the Islamic State. Mr. Erdogan has long viewed the Syrian Kurds as an extension of those in southeastern Turkey, whom he portrays as a mortal threat to national security.
As the Syria war raged, a fragile cease-fire between Turkish and Kurdish forces unraveled, giving way to fresh fighting. Mr. Erdogan took the resumption of hostilities combined with a coup attempt in 2016 as the impetus for an intensified crackdown on opponents -- real, imagined and otherwise.
His most recent foe is President Trump, whose doubling of tariffs on Turkish steel and aluminum earlier this month was delivered as punishment for Mr. Erdogan's refusal to release a jailed American pastor. Mr. Erdogan claims the pastor aided the failed coup. Washington says that's nonsense.
Mr. Trump's action sent the Turkish lira plunging anew, while handing Mr. Erdogan a useful device: Here was ostensible proof that enemies of Turkey were to blame for its economic problems.
Whatever the political optics, Turkey's crisis is in large part a homegrown affair. Mr. Erdogan's authoritarianism has destroyed confidence in Turkish institutions, especially its central bank, the body most crucial to arresting the economic fall.
As of June, Turkish private companies carried foreign currency debts reaching $220 billion, according to government figures, or roughly one-fourth of the overall economy. Persuading international investors to extend these debts and spare companies from bankruptcy requires that the central bank lift interest rates. But Mr. Erdogan has refused to go along, claiming -- contrary to basic economics -- that inflation is caused by high interest rates.
His unwillingness to raise rates reflects rational fears. Such a move would choke off growth and probably plunge Turkey into recession. But holding the course probably amounts to a slower, more winding path to the same destination, as investors flee Turkey and forsake the lira. That route may yet end at the doorstep of the International Monetary Fund, with a plea for a bailout.
If matters come to that, Mr. Erdogan would be back in a familiar place, his national fortunes tied again to relations with Europe and the United States, though not in the way he once hoped.

Full text: Turkish banks are pulling back on credit to consumers and businesses. Power plants have shut down because of the soaring cost of imported fuel. Building projects in Istanbul stand half finished after their backers ran out of money.
And, in a shopping mall beneath Istanbul's Trump Tower, Cenap Sarialioglu says he worries he will not be able to supply customers at his pharmacy with the prescription drugs they need to stay alive.
Mr. Sarialioglu, who is also president of the Istanbul chamber of pharmacists, said he has been getting calls from other pharmacists concerned that wholesalers will cut off supplies of crucial medications because they can no longer make a profit. Drug prices are set in Turkey, so the sharp drop in the lira has made it costly to import pharmaceuticals.
"Starting in September, we may have problems," Mr. Sarialioglu said. "An urgent solution is needed."
It has never been easy doing business on the edge of the war zone, in a country with its own rough politics, eye-popping inflation and volatile currency.
But in recent weeks the challenges facing Turkish banks and businesses have acquired a new level of intensity that is visible from the streets of Istanbul to the global financial markets. After losing a quarter of its value in a matter of days this month, the currency had recovered some ground before falling again on Friday. Its latest decline came as other emerging market currencies, like the South African rand and the Indian rupee, lost ground as well.
The lira's plunge in value, exacerbated by a dispute with the United States over a detained pastor, has exposed economic pressures that have been gathering for years. And some economists say that they could be reaching a breaking point. Over the past decade, businesses gorged on cheap debt, which is harder to pay back as the lira falls, while banks handed out credit cards like party favors.
"A recession is inevitable," said Selva Demiralp, a professor of economics at Koc University in Istanbul. "The question is whether it's going to be a soft landing or a hard landing."
Turkey's problems are so acute, Professor Demiralp said, that only drastic measures would stabilize the lira and contain official inflation of almost 16 percent. She said that the central bank would need to raise the official interest rate to around 28 percent, from 17.75 percent.
But the government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who is widely perceived as controlling the central bank, has shown no willingness to allow even a more modest rate increase or to curtail government spending on public works.
Government countermeasures so far have been regarded as tepid. Turkish bank regulators on Thursday announced limits on consumers' purchases made with credit. The central bank relaxed rules on the amount of money commercial banks need to keep in reserve, to free up cash they can use to deal with currency market turmoil. The government has insisted it will not restrict how much money Turks can transfer out of the country.
In a conference call with investors Thursday, Berat Albayrak, the Turkish finance minister, insisted that the banking system was healthy and promised measures that would bring inflation down to single digits. Mr. Albayrak offered few specifics, according to reports in Turkish and international media. And he ruled out assistance from the International Monetary Fund -- a step many analysts say will be essential to stabilize the economy.
Yet there is no sign that Mr. Erdogan is ready to allow measures that would restore investor confidence. Nafez Zouk, chief emerging markets economist at Oxford Economics in London, said he did not think the lira's recent rally would last.
"As soon as the next big thing hits the headlines," Mr. Zouk said, "we are going to be back to square one."
A recession would bring to an end nearly two decades of uninterrupted growth in Turkey. Most young people don't remember the last serious downturn in 2001. Since then, the country has cut poverty in half, brought millions of people into the middle class and, until recently, been embraced as a darling of international investors.
But the growth was built largely on a construction boom fueled by easy credit and government spending. The success story is looking increasingly unsustainable.
Even for Turks used to double-digit inflation and wild currency swings, the latest crisis has an ominous feel.
On a street called Nur-u Osmaniye, steps from Istanbul's famous grand bazaar, Arthur Kosaryan nodded toward a large empty storefront opposite the jewelry shop where he works. The space once housed one of Istanbul's finest antiques shops, Mr. Kosaryan said. But the landlord demanded the rent in dollars.
First a wave of terrorist bombings and an aborted coup in 2016 drove away tourists. Then, the lira began a slide early this year that wiped out nearly half its value. The shop owner could no longer afford to pay the rent and went out of business.
"In this volatility people stopped buying things," Mr. Kosaryan said. "They are waiting for prices to calm down."
So far Turkish business leaders are putting on a brave face. "We will survive," said Ugur Dalbeler, the chief executive of Colakoglu Metalurji, a steel maker. "We have gone through harder times."
Mr. Dalbeler did not say, but some Turkish managers may also be wary that expressions of pessimism would be perceived as unpatriotic in a country where the government has been known to seize assets of people considered disloyal.
Even by Turkish standards the steel industry is in a tough spot, as Mr. Dalbeler conceded. President Trump imposed a 50 percent tariff on Turkish steel after talks broke down to win the release of the detained pastor, Andrew Brunson.
"There is no way in the steel business you can compete when you have such a disadvantage," said Mr. Dalbeler, who is also a board member of the Turkish Steel Exporters' Association, an industry group.
Mr. Dalbeler, who in his youth was an exchange student in Iowa and speaks American-accented English, attributed Turkey's woes to a plot by the United States and Mr. Trump, rather than the policies of the Erdogan government. That is a common view among Turks.
Years ago, Mr. Dalbeler said, Iraq was the Turkish steel industry's biggest market. But the Arab Spring -- seen here as the consequence of American policy -- led to civil war in Syria and severely undercut the Middle East as a market for steel. Turkish steel producers, who specialize in the reinforcing bars used in construction as well as pipes used by the oil industry, adapted in part by increasing sales in the United States.
Now they will adapt again, said Namik Kemal Ekinci, head of a separate industry group that represents steel exporters. "We will be able to find new markets," he said. Mr. Trump and his advisers, he added, imposed tariffs because they were "jealous of our steel industry."
On Thursday Istanbul was noticeably calmer than late last week. The lira traded at 5.75 to the dollar, compared with 7 to the dollar at the beginning of the week.
In a narrow shop in Istanbul where he trades gold and silver, Gabriel Saglamoglu was defiant. "The Turkish economy is not going to be destroyed by a single tweet," he said, referring to Mr. Trump's announcement last week on Twitter that he would impose higher steel tariffs.
Business was frenzied a few days earlier, Mr. Saglamoglu said, as Turks bought precious metals as a hedge against the turmoil. But things have calmed down in part because of a pledge by Qatar to invest $15 billion in the Turkish economy, he said.
But economists considered Qatar's show of solidarity insignificant in proportion to Turkey's problems. Loans taken out in dollars are the main source of concern, since a falling lira makes them more expensive.
The country's companies will require $200 billion in financing from foreign banks and investors during 2018 to roll over existing debt, according to estimates by Oxford Economics. Lenders' willingness to provide that financing is in serious doubt.
On paper the number of bad loans in Turkey has not reached alarming levels. But several large Turkish companies have already asked banks for help restructuring their debts in recent months. Economists worry that others could run into trouble and banks may not be able to offer a lifeline.
The currency crisis has already begun to reveal the economic weaknesses that had been concealed by breakneck growth.
Several Turkish power plants have shut down temporarily because of the soaring cost, in lira terms, of imported fuel, though there have not yet been any blackouts. Companies are finding it more difficult to afford factory machinery and hospitals have been forced to buy cheaper X-ray machines.
The pharmacist, Mr. Sarialioglu, who remembers when Ivanka Trump visited the Trump-branded complex in Istanbul several years ago, said he worried about shortages of cancer drugs. They are almost always imported. The Turkish government regulates the cost of drugs, leaving no room for suppliers to raise prices.
"In oncology there are no substitutes," Mr. Sarialioglu said. "If the treatment does not happen very efficiently and right away, one may have irreversible consequences."

Hot Economy May Have Tepid Effect at the Polls

Full text: Republicans are telling you that tax cuts and roaring economic growth are going to stop any "blue wave" in the midterm elections. Democrats say the lack of wage growth, even as corporate profits surge, will impel voters to change leadership in Congress.
It's not that simple.
A new survey of nearly 10,000 American adults shows that the strong economy is rallying Republicans and maybe swaying some independents. But many voters still aren't feeling the benefits of robust growth, and the tax overhaul passed last year looks as likely to hurt Republicans at the polls as help them.
The data, from a survey conducted in early August for The New York Times by the online polling firm SurveyMonkey, paints a more complex picture than strategists and pundits of either political stripe usually portray. And it helps explain why, out on the campaign trail, candidates have tended to tread lightly when it comes to talking about the economy.
Here's a deeper dive into the latest numbers:
Americans are feeling good about the economy
SurveyMonkey's findings, based on five questions about Americans' financial situation and economic outlook, show consumer confidence well above the level that would indicate a neutral view of the economy. Asked how their finances have changed over the last year, Americans are twice as likely to say they are better off than worse off, and they are even more optimistic about the future.
But even with further declines in the unemployment rate and accelerating economic growth, Americans' confidence hasn't risen since the start of the year. And their outlook for the next 12 months has actually slipped a bit in recent months. Other surveys, showing a similar pattern, have found that anxiety about a trade war has made some Americans less upbeat about the future, even as they feel good about their immediate situation. New data from the University of Michigan on Friday found that consumer sentiment slipped in early August, with lower-income households in particular expressing concern about inflation.
Views on the economy are highly partisan
Among registered voters, more than 80 percent of those who judge themselves better off now than a year ago say they are at least leaning toward voting for Republicans in the midterms. That might suggest that the strong economy is serving as a big selling point for Republican candidates.
Complicating that story, though, is the fact that views on the economy have become starkly partisan in recent years. Hardly any Republicans -- 5 percent -- say they are worse off now than a year ago. At the same time, very few Democrats -- 14 percent -- say they are better off. Other questions reveal a similar split.
That split is nothing new. When Barack Obama was president, it was Democrats who felt good about the economy and Republicans who were dour; as soon as Mr. Trump took over, partisan views flipped. That suggests that feelings about the economy are less a driver of partisan opinion than a reflection of it.
"I don't think that there's a lot that's going to change on confidence," said Laura Wronski, a research scientist at SurveyMonkey. "People's responses are so consistent in terms of politics that there's just not a lot of movement that's possible."
Independents could be crucial
Democrats and Republicans might be too set in their opinions for the economy to affect their votes much. But what about the roughly 17 percent of Americans who don't identify with either major political party? (In this article, we're counting people who say they "lean" toward one party or the other as members of those parties.) Though relatively small, that group could be decisive in many narrow House races.
There are hints that the economy could sway them. Over all, independents who say they plan to vote in November tend to favor Democrats over Republicans by about 2 to 1. But that ratio is nearly flipped among independents who say their finances are better off than a year ago.
The economy appears to be a particularly significant factor for more affluent, educated independents -- a group that could be crucial for Republican chances in November.
The tax law is motivating Republicans -- and Democrats
When Republicans sped their $1.5 trillion tax cut package through Congress last year, they were certain it would work to their political advantage. (Voters, they reasoned, would be seeing fatter paychecks and turn out to thank Republicans at the polls.) Democrats said the opposite: that a bill that included large benefits for corporations and the wealthy would outrage voters and push them to throw Republicans out.
When it comes to firing up base voters, both parties were right: The poll finds that 69 percent of Republicans say the law makes them more likely to vote for a Republican candidate, while 73 percent of Democrats say the law makes them less likely to vote for a Republican. (Both numbers are based on registered voters who plan to vote this fall.)
When it comes to swing voters, Democrats were right, the poll suggests. Just 12 percent of independent voters say the law makes them more likely to vote for a Republican. Nearly three times as many, 32 percent, say the law makes them less likely to vote Republican. A majority, 57 percent, say it doesn't matter either way.
The economy might not be decisive
In modern American politics, the president's party typically loses seats in a midterm congressional election. Republicans are hopeful that the accelerating economy will help them buck that trend this year. Party leaders including Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the majority leader, have pointed to the 1998 midterms, when President Bill Clinton was mired in impeachment proceedings but Democrats gained seats in the House anyway, in the midst of a booming national economy.
That election was an outlier. Political scientists -- including Lynn Vavreck at the University of California, Los Angeles, and Seth Masket at the University of Denver, among many others -- have shown that economic conditions matter far less to midterm results than presidential approval ratings. In 1950, when the economy grew at a blistering 8.7 percent for the year, President Harry Truman's party still lost 28 seats in the House.
Voters' perceptions of the economy this year fall roughly in between the last two midterm years when the unemployment rate was near 4 percent: 1998 and 2006. Shortly before the 1998 midterms, when Mr. Clinton and his party gained five House seats, two-thirds of respondents to a Gallup survey rated the economy as excellent or good. In 2006, when President George W. Bush's party lost 31 seats and control of the House, 44 percent rated the economy as excellent or good. The most recent Gallup poll shows that 55 percent of respondents rate the economy similarly now.
If history is a guide, those numbers are less important than Mr. Trump's approval rating, which is currently underwater: 44 percent of Americans approve of his performance, while 53 percent disapprove, the Times poll shows. That rating is much closer to Mr. Bush's approval in 2006, which dropped below 40 percent in Gallup polls just before the midterm elections, than to Mr. Clinton's in 1998, which rose to 66 percent by Election Day.
______
About the survey: The data in this article came from an online survey of 9,558 adults conducted by the polling firm SurveyMonkey from Aug. 6 to Aug. 12. The company selected respondents at random from the nearly three million people who take surveys on its platform each day. Responses were weighted to match the demographic profile of the population of the United States. The survey has a modeled error estimate (similar to a margin of error in a standard telephone poll) of plus or minus 1.5 percentage points, so differences of less than that amount are statistically insignificant.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text: CEDAR FALLS, Iowa -- The unemployment rate here is one of the lowest in the country. Wages are rising at nearly twice the rate of inflation. Jobs are so plentiful that manufacturers are paying to train unskilled workers.
Yet Iowa is also one of the states most vulnerable to a trade war. And that could be a problem for Representative Rod Blum.
"I'm not on the ledge ready to jump out the window concerning trade, but I do have the window open a little bit," said Mr. Blum, a two-term Republican incumbent vying for re-election in one of the nation's most competitive House races.
Iowa has a lot riding on global trade. Its farmers export one of every four rows of soybeans -- worth around $2 billion -- to China. One in five Iowans has a job tied to agriculture, and not just on farms. John Deere has several plants in the state, making tractors and combines, and hundreds of metal manufacturers churn out fences and grain bins for family farmers and corporate growers.
If the trade dispute between the United States and much of the world isn't resolved soon, economists say, it will almost certainly lead to layoffs and unyielding financial loss across the state. Republican strategists worry that the simmering unease over that possibility may be enough to keep party faithful at home on Election Day in November.
"We need some wins," Mr. Blum said in an interview. "We need something to rally around, something good. If we could do a deal with Mexico, that would be great."
President Trump has urged farmers to "be a little patient" with trade negotiations, and he recently announced a $12 billion aid package for those hurt by the tariffs. In July, Mr. Trump made a stop in the district to campaign for Mr. Blum, promising the Iowans in the crowd that they wouldn't be "too angry with Trump" once the trade scuffles came to an end.
Kevin Harberts isn't angry. He is anxious, though.
Since the president imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum in March, Mr. Harberts's company, Kryton Engineered Metals, has paid hundreds of thousands of dollars more than expected on the metals.
"It bites," he said. "For us, that's huge money."
And yet Mr. Harberts is standing by Mr. Trump.
He is on track to sell more parts than ever. He can't hire fast enough to fill the geyser of orders coming in.
"If Hillary would've won, I don't think we would've been in this mode," he said. "In spite of the hassle and frustration, everyone is doing good."
The question is how long those good times can last. Economists are certain that if the tariffs remain in place, they will lead to layoffs, farm foreclosures and bankruptcies -- but not right away. Iowa may feel only a subtle effect by November, economists said, although any damage will almost certainly be felt in full by the time the state's first-in-the-nation presidential caucuses roll around in early 2020.
"It's possible that it might look good right up until the midterms," said David Swenson, an economist at Iowa State University. "Even though everything we know about economics says that can't be true in the long run."
Already, there are signs that the tariffs are beginning to filter through the regional economy. Chinese buyers have been canceling hundreds of thousands of tons of soybean orders since April, according to Department of Agriculture data, and soybean prices fell close to a 10-year low in July. Soybean producers in Iowa stand to lose $624 million from the trade war, according to Chad Hart, an economist at Iowa State University.
In Iowa, trouble in the agriculture sector invariably spreads to the rest of the economy. Recent business surveys have found that farmers are becoming more reluctant to buy equipment and that local bankers are becoming gloomier in their outlook.
"Agriculture is always the first casualty of a trade war," said Ernie Goss, a business professor who studies the Midwestern economy at Creighton University in Omaha.
Mr. Harberts, for example, makes housings for fans that go into massive grain bins made by Sukup Manufacturing, 60 miles northwest of here in Sheffield. Steve Sukup, the chief financial officer, has started grumbling about how metal prices are eating into his profit. Like Mr. Harberts, Mr. Sukup buys his metal from American steel mills. Several months before the tariffs were announced, those mills started to increase prices, he said, in anticipation of the protection they were about to receive. "They raised prices because they could," he said.
And he heard from clients in California who said that their Chinese buyers recently froze all orders of almonds. Mr. Sukup said that "the realization has sunk in" among Iowa soybean farmers that the tariffs could push foreign buyers away for good.
"Once they go elsewhere, it's hard to get them back," he said.
Mr. Sukup, a Trump voter, said Mr. Blum "has got some headwinds" in the midterms, partly because of the tariffs.
Democrats spy an opportunity.
"It seems bizarre to live in a world where the president is actively producing anxiety on his side two months before an election," said Sue Dvorsky, a former chairwoman of the Iowa Democratic Party. "Generally what that does is depress turnout."
Mr. Blum is treading delicately. In June, he signed a letter, along with the entire Iowa delegation, urging Mr. Trump to "avoid a trade war." But Mr. Blum thanked the president during his July visit for "having political courage to renegotiate these trade deals."
Abby Finkenauer, the 29-year-old Democratic challenger in the race, called those comments "heartbreaking." Ms. Finkenauer, a state legislator, has built a bigger campaign treasury than Mr. Blum and recently won the endorsement of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.
"We deserve a lot better than a congressman who sits there and thanks somebody for throwing livelihoods in flux," Ms. Finkenauer said in an interview.
The fate of the contest in November may hinge on whether Kevin Watje changes his mind.
Mr. Watje, 60, is a Trump supporter and a reliable Republican voter who lives in Waterloo, in the heart of Mr. Blum's district. He's giving the president the benefit of the doubt on trade.
As the chief executive of Curbtender, a garbage truck manufacturer, Mr. Watje sees that American companies can be at a disadvantage in global markets.
He says the tariffs have been kneecapping his business. The prices for the American steel he buys have risen up to 40 percent since March. He can't get metal on time anymore. "It's thrown a wrench into the gears," he said.
With the economy still humming, Mr. Watje figures he can absorb the losses for a little while. If the trade aggression keeps ratcheting up, though, he thinks it could end the good times in Iowa and the rest of the country.
"We could go into a deep recession again," he said. "Then I would make a connection to Congress that they didn't put a stop to it."
For now, he plans to vote for Mr. Blum in November. But he's open to hearing what the Democrats have to offer. And if the pain stretches into the winter, all bets are off.
"I would probably change my mind about voting for Trump," Mr. Watje said. "When it gets past six months, we probably are all going to start changing our minds about who we are voting for."

Full text: MEDELLÍN, Colombia -- Faced with nearly incomprehensible inflation -- 32,714 percent as of Wednesday -- Venezuelan officials thought they had a solution: They changed the color of the bank notes and increased their denomination. Then they said they would lop off three zeros. And when that didn't seem enough, they announced they would cut off two more.
The tactics have left Venezuelans like Yosmar Nowak, the owner of a coffee shop in Caracas, convinced that there is no solution in sight and that the government cannot even bring down the price of a cup of coffee, an eye-watering 2 million bolívars.
"I imagine if we keep like this we're going to have to do the same thing in December," said Ms. Nowak, who has been forced to raise prices in her cafe at least 40 times this year.
Slashing zeros from Venezuela's inflation-cursed currency, the bolívar, is the tent-pole of a set of economic changes by President Nicolás Maduro as he tries to right his country's capsized economy. The five-digit inflation has earned Venezuela comparisons to the hyperinflation of Zimbabwe and Weimar Germany from the International Monetary Fund.
The newly minted currency, which will be known as the "sovereign bolívar," will be rolled out on Monday. In addition, the president has ordered measures that his United Socialist Party has been loath to consider in the past: An increase in gas prices for some drivers and a modest ease in the currency controls that have made dollars inaccessible to most Venezuelans for years.
Yet these changes haven't been enough to convince economists, who see desperation in Mr. Maduro's latest moves and view the new currency as another chapter in the decades of mismanagement that have destroyed the Venezuelan economy.
"It's a cosmetic thing that's happening, the zeros," said Steve Hanke, an applied economics professor at Johns Hopkins University who has advised governments facing hyperinflation. "It means nothing unless you change economic policy."
By removing the zeros, Mr. Maduro is looking to solve what economists call hyperinflation's "wheelbarrow problem" -- the point when the currency has become so worthless that a wheelbarrow of cash is necessary to make purchases.
The new currency, which will be phased in as the old one is phased out, would bring the price of that cup of coffee at Ms. Nowak's shop down to the more manageable sum of 20 sovereign bolívars. But few think that price will hold for long.
"We're expecting an increase in more than 1,000 percent for the minimum wage, and of course, more inflation," Ms. Nowak said. The tumult is so great, she said, "we're not going to open Monday."
The problem isn't to do with the zeros, but rather what's causing them to appear. The Venezuelan government depends on sales from its state oil company to pay its debts. But mismanagement allowed production to sink to 1.2 million barrels a day in July -- on par with the monthly rate in 1947.
Faced with this shortage, the government turns to the Central Bank to order more money printed. While that may pay the government's bills in the short term, it comes at the expense of everyone who owns bolívars, as the surplus of printed cash makes existing money increasingly worthless.
And paying bills is only one of Mr. Maduro's concerns.
On Aug. 4, two drones exploded over a military parade Mr. Maduro was attending, in what the government said was an assassination attempt. And the president faces increasing economic isolation after he was declared the winner of an election to extend his term to 2025, a vote widely regarded as rigged.
Amid this chaos, hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans are fleeing the country, finding daily life impossible in a country where grocery stores are empty and hospitals face water shortages, even in Caracas, the capital.
The rollout of the currency has also been troubled, too. At first, the government said it would remove three zeros from the bills. But on July 25, with the dollar trading for nearly 3.5 million bolívars on the black market and continuing to lose value, the government said it would lop off five instead.
The bolívar has only continued to lose value in the time since, with the dollar now approaching 6 million bolívars.
While the changes mean prices that are less astronomical, they also create another problem for Venezuelans: Dividing by the unwieldy number 100,000. Economists say devaluations are usually done in increments of tens, thousands or millions to facilitate the math.
"I am confused," said Edwin García, a construction worker in Caracas who tried to calculate what his earnings would be.
Many stores in the capital now simply quote prices in dollars to avoid confusion.
It's also unclear what backs the new currency, if anything at all.
Troubled currencies are usually stabilized with a pledge from the government that they may be exchanged for a stronger one, like dollars or euros. Mr. Maduro, by contrast, has said the new bolívar will be backed by the petro, a cryptocurrency his government rolled out in February.
And the petro itself, he said, is backed by oil reserves -- a claim economists find troubling, given that much of the country's oil production is earmarked to pay off debt to China and Russia.
"You're pegging a currency to a toxic asset which no one wants," said Daniel Lansberg-Rodríguez, a political columnist for the Venezuelan newspaper El Nacional who teaches at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management.
Mr. Maduro's plan to raise gas prices has also been met with skepticism.
Venezuelans currently pay a fraction of a cent to fill up their tanks -- the lowest price in the world. Mr. Maduro has pledged to continue subsidizing fuel for those who sign up for a government identification card and register their cars with the government, but he wants Venezuelans who don't sign up to start paying the going international price.
"It allows you to target the subsidy to those willing to buy into the system," said Mr. Lansberg-Rodríguez. "It's a bid for loyalty."
In gas stations in Caracas, there were more doubts about the plan. Alejandro Bolívar, a station supervisor in the suburb of El Hatillo, said no one from the government had come to reset the machines to the new currency or to explain when they would need to start verifying if buyers had government ID cards.
For its part, the Venezuelan government claims inflation has been caused by an "economic war" waged by the United States and business people who oppose it.
But economists said that if Venezuela is to curb hyperinflation, it will have to stop printing money.
Mr. Hanke, the Johns Hopkins economist, recalls a similar situation in Yugoslavia, which he advised until 1991. Though Mr. Hanke objected to its currency changes, the country pushed ahead in 1990, removing four zeros from its bills. Its succeeding government removed another zero in 1992. In October 1993 it removed six zeros, in December nine more, and then at the start of 1994 another seven.
With hyperinflation running at 313 million percent per month, the mint couldn't keep up.
And that country, Mr. Hanke noted, had a world-class mint. Mr. Maduro has no working mint, and must import bank notes.
"It's an impossible situation," said Mr. Hanke.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text: Falling back on a standard excuse of besieged strongmen, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey is blaming traitors and outside powers for his nation's financial crisis, and describing the strong United States dollar as among "the bullets, cannonballs and missiles" foreigners are using to wage "economic war" on his country.
Many emerging markets make themselves vulnerable to financial crisis by spending more than they can afford, and relying on foreign lenders to fund these profligate habits, but Turkey was an extreme case even before Mr. Erdogan took power in 2002. Of late, his reckless economic policies -- including setting interest rates at artificially low levels, and driving up debts, deficits and inflation -- have only made matters worse. Many wealthy Turks saw another crisis coming and were fleeing the country well before foreigners joined the recent rush, accelerating the fall of the Turkish lira over the past few days.
Turkey's troubles are homegrown, and the economic war against it is a figment of Mr. Erdogan's conspiratorial imagination. But he does have a point about the impact of a surging dollar, which has a long history of inflicting damage on developing nations.
Like many emerging world currency crises before it, this one comes at a time when the U.S. Federal Reserve is raising interest rates, pushing up the value of the dollar. As the dollar strengthens, developing countries like Turkey have a harder time paying back their dollar debts, and eventually investors start to flee.
Now the question is whether Turkey is poised to trigger a wider global crisis, the way the fall of the Thai baht did in 1997. The answer is not clear. The fall of the Turkish lira has had a negative effect on other emerging market currencies, but few of those countries share Turkey's dual problem of having large foreign debt and government policies that fuel inflation.
But there is an even bigger question looming: The strong dollar that is weakening Turkey's economy may also be undermining the world's second-largest economy, China.
China is vulnerable to the strong dollar for different reasons. At one level, China is far less dependent on imports than Turkey, which has to buy virtually all its raw materials, including oil from abroad. Unlike Turkey, China does not run a chronic trade deficit and does not have to borrow heavily in dollars to finance its purchases abroad.
In the wake of the global financial crisis of 2008, however, Beijing tried to keep its economy humming by ordering state banks to pump out new loans. More than half the increase in global debt over the past decade was issued as domestic loans inside China. There is now much more money circulating in China than in the United States, much of it in the hands of Chinese who are constantly on the watch for higher returns.
So China also faces a serious risk of capital flight. The last bout began in 2015, amid early indications that the Federal Reserve was going to start raising interest rates. China stopped that exodus by tightening its currency controls, but controls rarely work for long. Savvy locals find creative ways to get their money out.
This year, the Fed's tightening has further strengthened the dollar, while Beijing's easy money policies have further weakened the renminbi -- increasing the incentive for Chinese investors to dump China's currency for dollars. Right now Chinese can earn the same interest rates in the United States for a lot less risk, so the motivation to flee is high, and will grow more intense as the Fed raises rates further.
Beijing could also diminish the allure of the strong dollar by trying to raise the value of its own currency. But that would mean tightening the supply of renminbi, which is likely to derail the economy at a time when growth in China is already slowing under the burden of too much debt.
China has also tried to challenge the hegemony of the dollar by making the renminbi more widely popular, but that is a long-term project, so far unsuccessful. Though the United States share of the global economy is down to 23 percent from a high of 32 percent in 2001, the dollar is still by far the world's favorite currency for everything from lending to paying for exports and imports.
More than 60 percent of the foreign currency held in reserve by central banks around the world is in dollars, and China's ambition to make the renminbi a reserve currency has attracted hardly any takers. Global central banks and investors are still wary of holding a currency that Communist authorities may slap controls on at any time -- as they did in 2016.
As this crisis unfolds, attention is likely to shift from the relatively small global threat posed by Turkey to the much larger one posed by China -- and from President Trump's tariff wars to currency wars. Though the Trump administration has accused China of weakening its currency to make its exports more competitive, over the past few days China has shifted to trying to prevent the renminbi -- already down 7 percent against the dollar over the past two months -- from weakening further. The last thing Beijing wants is a sudden crisis in confidence.
So China is in a tough spot. The strengthening dollar threatens to provoke more capital flight out of China, but any effort to shore up the renminbi in response could further slow the Chinese economy. For years Beijing has responded to signs of weakness in the economy by printing more renminbi, which worked fine when the United States was also running a very loose monetary policy. Now that the United States is raising interest rates, lowering rates in China will only give Chinese investors more reason to leave the country.
The fate of the world economy depends on how China negotiates this dilemma. Its $14 trillion economy is more than 15 times larger than Turkey's, representing about 16 percent of the global economy. It is pivotal. For the rest of the world, the collapse of the lira may prove to be a passing event, and China is likely to decide which way this crisis goes.

Why Turkey's Crisis Feels Familiar For Emerging Markets: It's the Debt

Full text: For nearly 10 years now, the flood of cash from global central banks has financed shopping malls in Istanbul, booming cities in China and 100-year bonds in Argentina. Today, many of the malls are empty, property developers in China are riddled with debt, and Argentina has just submitted to a bailout from the International Monetary Fund.
Now, the borrowing binge that fueled rapid growth in emerging markets and piled up returns for their investors is looking like a problem.
Financial experts worry that the turmoil in Turkey, which for the better part of a year has been contained, will spread, following the path of other emerging market meltdowns like those in Mexico in 1994 and Asia in 1997.
"The risk of contagion is pretty high," said Robert Subbaraman, an emerging market economist at Nomura in Singapore.
The crisis in Turkey has been made worse by a diplomatic dispute with the United States and the mercurial moods and questionable policy positions of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, but the combination of heavy international borrowing and a fall in the national currency is the same scenario that could undermine other emerging economies.
"Turkey is a symptom of the growing challenges for emerging markets," said Mr. Subbaraman. "Due to super-low interest rates, investors have been on the hunt for yield -- until this year. Now they will be blindsided by the risks."
In a research note that Mr. Subbaraman published on Monday, he pointed to South Africa, Hong Kong, the Philippines, Chile and Mexico as having the most vulnerable economies. South Africa, for example, has significant levels of dollar debt and a sizable current account deficit.
A country runs a current account deficit if it takes in more money -- in investments and trade -- from foreigners than it sends to other countries. That leaves the country at the mercy of international investors to keep it afloat financially, and those investors could find other markets more enticing -- particularly when emerging markets see their currencies lose value. That is precisely what forced Argentina to go to the I.M.F., the first major emerging market to take such a step during this period of uncertainty. Pakistan may soon have to forge its own deal with the fund for similar reasons.
Mr. Subbaraman said the buildup in cheap dollar credit could ultimately threaten South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia and even China, whose currency, the renminbi, weakened further against the dollar this week. But analysts have long believed that these economies are strong enough to withstand a traditional contagion attack. By his own account, Mr. Subbaraman has one of the more gloomy views on the future of these markets -- earlier this year he published a report titled "Enjoy the Party, but Stay Close to the Door."
On Wednesday, the lira rebounded to 6 against the dollar from its recent low of 7.2, helped by steps the Turkish government took this week to limit sales of lira for dollars, and a promise by the emir of Qatar to invest $15 billion in Turkey.
Regulators also took an unusual step to help troubled banks, suspending the requirement that banks book losses on the value of their plummeting securities.
Global markets were shakier, though. Emerging market currencies, especially the South African rand, the Russian ruble and the Mexican peso, were down sharply against the dollar. European banks with exposure to Turkey, like BBVA in Spain, UniCredit in Italy and BNP Paribas in France sold off as well.
Predicting an emerging market crisis -- and the extent to which such a blowup will trigger a wider financial rout -- can be hazardous. In 2014, during the so-called Taper Tantrum, investors took out more than a trillion dollars from the likes of Brazil and India, fearing an eventual rise in interest rates in the United States. Stock markets in the United States and Europe shuddered, then resumed their upward march. Those who fled eventually returned to these markets, lured by the promise of rich returns in what continued to be a low-interest-rate world.
And in the 21 years since Thailand's economy went bust -- the last genuine case of emerging market contagion -- these countries have all dramatically reformed their economies. They have accumulated cash cushions to deploy in case of an assault on their currencies and aggressively fought inflation by raising interest rates. Central bankers, finance ministers and even politicians have become seasoned pros in terms of responding to the effect of capital rushing in and out of their economies. Brazil and Mexico, for example, are two countries that have, through a combination improved policies and proactive steps to fight inflation, drawn investor plaudits.
Jan Dehn, the head of research at Ashmore Investment Management, a large investor in emerging market bonds, contends that the chance the virus in Turkey spreads widely is minimal. He said that in the past decade, most of the large developing markets have established robust local institutions, such as pension funds, that have become the main buyers of corporate and government debt -- in their own currencies. That means when fretting foreigners sell their bonds, domestic institutions can step in and buy them, preventing a selling frenzy from becoming something worse.
"This development has broken the link between fickle outflows and economic catastrophe," Mr. Dehn said. "Before, a country could collapse if there were outflows -- even if it did nothing wrong. That is not true anymore."
Perhaps the most arresting statistic in support of the view that Turkey is the canary in the coal mine is the vast amount of cheap dollar-based loans that have accumulated worldwide since global central banks began their rescue operations in early 2009. Countries from Nigeria to Tajikistan have aggressively sought -- and received -- cash from yield-starved mutual funds.
According to the Bank for International Settlements, a forum for global central banks, the total amount of dollar-based loans has jumped from $5.8 trillion in the first quarter of 2009 to $11.4 trillion today. Of that, $3.7 trillion has gone to emerging markets, more than doubling during that period.
Via loans by American, European and Japanese banks or through mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, credit has been easy and very much available for every variety of borrower, not least those erecting malls in Turkey, skyscrapers in China or taking out century loans in now-bust Argentina.
Analysts at the B.I.S., especially its top economist, Hyun Song Shin, have been warning about this phenomenon for years. Their main point is this: When interest rates rise in the United States, increasing the value of the dollar, foreign corporations and governments will have trouble repaying these debts in their depreciating national currencies -- precisely what is happening in Turkey right now.
According to research by Sebnem Kalemli-Ozcan, an economist at the University of Maryland, much of this debt has gone to companies that do not have dollar revenues. These companies, many of which are in the construction or real estate sector, are the ones that are in the most danger.
Take Turkey, she said. As long ago as 2011, 70 percent of the debt held by the Turkish construction industry was in foreign currency. That figure, she contends, has surely risen since then, as the country has experienced a real estate boom.
"This corporate debt issue is bad," she said. "It is going to blow up at some point."
Even if the other emerging markets do not succumb to the pressures Turkey is experiencing, there is another route for trouble to spread: European banks, many of which have been enthusiastic lenders to Turkish corporations and financial institutions.
Shweta Singh, an analyst at TS Lombard, a London research house, points out that the European banks with the most significant exposure to Turkey -- BBVA, BNP Paribas and UniCredit -- are among the weakest in the eurozone in terms of their equity cushions.
During the Greek debt crisis, the panic began over concerns that large European banks holding dodgy Greek bonds would suffer bruising losses. And that's what happened.
Should such banks experience the same problem with Turkish loans, "the ripple effect could be tremendous," Ms. Singh said.

Full text: ISTANBUL -- Prices have soared on imported goods, scaring buyers and sellers. Sales are off as Turks delay purchases or cut back. Everyone is quoting the exchange rate, feverishly calculating what to do with his or her savings, large and small, and watching the price of goods daily. "My pension is not enough," Zerrin Yildirim said as she sat with a friend on the steps of their apartment building in an old quarter of Istanbul, bemoaning the prices in the nearby fruit and vegetable market.
Turks across the country have been thrown into a frenzy as the Turkish lira has lost 25 percent of its value since last week. A standoff between Turkey and the United States, which has imposed sanctions, accelerated a long decline in the lira this year over fears of mismanagement of the economy.
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is making several speeches a day, casting the economic crisis as a national struggle, and laying the blame for the lira's fall on foreign powers. In the latest, on Tuesday, he called on Turks to boycott American electronic products.
But there are already signs that the quiet panic setting in among ordinary citizens is threatening to undermine Mr. Erdogan's nationalist appeals.
Mrs. Yildirim, 55, a retired intensive-care nurse, blamed people who had voted for the president, even as the economic decline and rising prices could be felt before June's election.
"People always complained about prices," she said. "But they still vote for the one guy they complain about. We used to call such people sheep, but sheep are clever. When it rains they go into the barn, not under the tree. But these people are more stupid than that. They still voted him in."
Now, analysts warned, one effect of the steep depreciation of the lira was almost certain to be runaway inflation, which amounts to an instant pay cut, especially for the poor and middle classes.
Already at 15 percent, inflation in Turkey will soar in coming months, predicted Atilla Yesilada, an Istanbul-based consultant at Global Source Partners, a management consultancy firm, and a political commentator.
"Every 10 percent depreciation of the lira leads to a rise of inflation of 2 percent," Mr. Yesilada said. "In three months inflation will be 20 percent. That is the equivalent of losing one-third of your salary -- it is a tremendous cost."
Mr. Erdogan has long insisted on maintaining low interest rates in his pursuit of strong growth, and rejects the widely accepted economic orthodoxy that inflation is controlled by raising interest rates. As the lira fell in the weeks before the June election he was persuaded by his senior officials to agree to a modest interest rate hike.
But since then he has announced his determination to take greater control of monetary policy -- and of the Central Bank -- and has resisted calls for further interest rate hikes, even after the lira's dramatic fall on Friday.
It is the kind of interference in the economy that has already frightened investors and contributed greatly to the drop in the lira, long before the current standoff.
The fallout could hurt Mr. Erdogan's Justice and Development Party in local elections scheduled for March of next year, Mr. Yesilada said.
The party faltered in the recent parliamentary elections, even as Mr. Erdogan won the presidential election, and voters may punish the party even more in the local elections, which have long been an important base of Mr. Erdogan's power.
Mr. Erdogan has tried to turn the crisis to his political advantage by pushing his nationalist stance.
For now, the president's opponents have lined up behind him in his dispute with the United States over Turkey's detention of an evangelical preacher, Andrew Brunson, and some 20 other Americans swept up in Mr. Erdogan's crackdown after a failed coup two years ago.
The Turks have demanded, to no avail, that the United States extradite a Pennsylvania-based Islamic preacher blamed for orchestrating the coup, Fethulla Gulen.
Veterans and Mr. Erdogan's supporters have held nationalist rallies, declaring that they will convert their dollars into Turkish lira in support of the country. Few seemed to believe that they actually would, however. Many Turks have long hedged against a decline in the lira by switching savings to foreign currencies.
Mr. Erdogan may manage to ride out the crisis thanks to chance. Next week, the Muslim holiday Eid al-Adha falls between two weekends, giving Turks nine days of vacation. Banks will be closed, and the government will have a chance to recover.
Still, Mr. Erdogan's call for Turks to boycott American electronic goods, singling out Apple, was swiftly lampooned on social media, not least because the president himself is well known for owning and using an iPhone.
"Every product that we buy in foreign currency from outside, we will produce them here and sell abroad," Mr. Erdogan said during a speech in Ankara, drawing applause and cheers. "We will boycott the electronics products of the U.S."
"If they have the iPhone, there is Samsung" as an alternative, he continued, referring to Apple's rival in the smartphone business.
But it is not quite that easy.
An electronics store in one of the busiest downtown markets was empty at 11:30 a.m. The shop owner, Suat Durnah, 63, leapt up from his chair in his eagerness to vent his fears and frustrations to a reporter.
"The market is very slow," Mr. Durnah said. "I only just made my first sale of the day." Normally he said, he would have made six or seven sales by that time.
Almost everything the store sells comes from China, but it pays for goods in U.S. dollars, he said. As the lira has depreciated, the Turkish prices have doubled this year, and tripled since last year, he said.
He pointed to a desk telephone. "Last year, that telephone was selling for 28, 40 lira. Now it is 85, 90 lira," he said.
Political analysts say Turkish voters can be unforgiving when their pockets are hit.
"The people will make the choice over the hardships being forced on them, and some loose nationalist ideal being offered them," said Mr. Yesilada, the commentator.
On the streets of Istanbul, the anxiety was evident. Restaurateurs and cafe owners are already struggling with a 50 percent drop in business over the past three years after terrorist attacks scared away many foreign tourists.
Now other Turkish businesses are feeling the downturn.
A storekeeper, Mustafa Yuksel, 30, who sells gardening equipment and insecticides, most of it imported, said he had raised his prices as soon as the lira fell on Friday.
"To stand on our feet, we immediately raised our prices," he said.
People who needed to buy were surprised but going ahead. But some, including the local city municipalities, were holding off, he said.
Business was also down at the Sehremini Market, where the pensioners did their shopping. The salesmen attributed the fall in sales to the summer holidays, since many families leave the city, but several admitted they were worried.
Few would blame it on Mr. Erdogan, however. A fruit seller, Sedat Eski, blamed it on the British, alluding to one of many conspiracy theories encouraged by Mr. Erdogan -- that foreign powers were behind the currency crash in order to undermine Turkey.
"All the rich people pulled out their money at 2 a.m.," Mr. Eski said. Turkey's richest people had moved their money to the United Kingdom, he said. "And who do you think is pulling their strings."
About the only ones who seemed to be enjoying the plunge in the lira were foreign tourists, who were snapping up sudden bargains on luxury goods in the high-end district of Nisantasi.
Twenty-five tourists from Dubai, Saudi Arabia and Iran were lined up outside the Louis Vuitton store on the corner of Abdi Ipekci Street, where luxury fashion houses have their boutiques.
"I've been doing a lot of shopping," said Amanda Ibrahim, 28, an economics assistant who was on a trip from Sweden. Prices were down 40 percent because of the exchange rate, she said.
"A couple days ago, it was more expensive here than Sweden," she said.
In the Zorlu Center, one of Istanbul's biggest shopping malls, salespeople said they had almost sold out their stock to Asian tourists paying in Turkish liras.
An American student, Rachel York, 21, who works at the Robert College of Istanbul, was less pleased.
"We agreed on getting paid in Turkish lira at the beginning of summer," she lamented, "and now we regret it because we essentially lost one third of our salary."

Full text: Investors are fretting about emerging markets again. Turkey is the front-burner concern at the moment, but what really is getting people's attention is the prospect that the financial problems there could spread to other fast-growing but risky countries.
If history is any indication, that has the potential to quickly turn a local crisis into a global one. Or maybe not.
What's happening in Turkey?
Over the last week the value of the Turkish lira collapsed by more than 20 percent, shocking financial markets.
At first glance, this seems like a problem peculiar to Turkey, as the country's economy has weakened.
At the same time, Turkey's authoritarian president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has been seizing greater control over the country's economic policy. He appointed his son-in-law as finance minister. He has made a series of pronouncements that undercut the independence of the country's central bank, railing against the prospect of high interest rates.
Lower interest rates tend to stoke growth -- as well as inflation. And Turkey is already dealing with inflation running near an annual rate of 16 percent.
Foreign investors are scared. They have been pulling money out of the country. In practice, that means that they sell lira and buy dollars or other currencies. The result is that the value of the lira has plunged. And that has the potential to upend the Turkish economy and financial system.
Why does this matter to the world?
Turkey's economy isn't all that large, so even if it were to collapse, that wouldn't necessarily have a huge impact on the global economy.
But elements of the Turkish saga show how other financial markets could be vulnerable to a similar exodus of foreign investors.
In recent years, investors in wealthier parts of the world, like the United States, Europe and Japan, have lent many billions of dollars to governments and companies in developing economies like Turkey, South Africa and Argentina.
That has been an attractive proposition because interest rates in the United States and other developed markets have been incredibly low, as central banks tried to nurse their economies back to health after the last recession. The higher rates on offer in countries like Turkey have acted as magnets for foreign capital.
Now, with the economy of the United States strong again, the Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates. As a result, keeping money invested in American markets looks like a better deal, and the dollar has strengthened.
The stronger dollar is bad news for foreign countries and companies that borrowed dollars. That's because currency moves are always relative. If the dollar is up, that means other currencies are down, and vice versa. A stronger dollar therefore makes it more difficult for foreigners to pay back their dollar-based loans.
Turkey is far from the only country whose economy has grown reliant on foreign lending. Argentina and South Africa are in the same boat. That's why some think that the problems underway in Turkey could be the start of something bigger.
Indeed, Argentina's central bank on Monday surprised markets by raising its interest rates by five percentage points. It was an attempt to prop up its currency by encouraging foreign investors to stick around.
How do problems spread?
That is certainly how it's worked at times in the past. One highly indebted, fast-growing economy starts to unravel, and others tend to follow, as fearful investors rush for the exits. In most cases, those countries' economies aren't all that large, but the chain reactions they trigger in the financial markets can have global repercussions.
In 1994, the Mexican government devalued the peso, setting off a period of financial instability that came to be known as the Tequila Crisis. In 1997, the collapse of the Thai baht set off a financial crisis throughout East Asia.
And in 1998, the devaluation of the Russian ruble threatened to spread instability to the heart of the developed world, when it contributed to the collapse of large American hedge fund Long Term Capital Management, sending financial markets in the United States into a panic.
In past crises, one way that trouble spread was through the banking system. Foreign banks lent money to companies, investors and governments in the crisis-stricken countries. As borrowers defaulted, those loans led to deep losses that threatened to undermine the health of financial systems thousands of miles away.
There are echoes of that situation in today's Turkey crisis. A number of large European banks -- including Italy's UniCredit, Spain's BBVA and France's BNP Paribas -- own stakes in Turkish lenders. Other western banks are exposed to Turkey via loans to Turkish companies.
Those banking losses might not look likely to presage a broader crisis. But if other emerging-market countries follow Turkey into trouble, the losses could worsen.
"This has the potential to be a real crisis," said Gary N. Kleiman, an emerging-market investment consultant who argues that too many developing economies have taken on too much debt. "Banks are overstretched, and soon you are going to see an increase in nonperforming loans. It is going to spread."
On the other hand, events that look like they could shake the foundations of the global financial system sometimes fizzle out.
In 2013, when the Fed signaled that it was preparing to start removing some of the emergency support it had provided to the financial system, some investors panicked. Emerging-market currencies and stock markets bore the brunt of the so-called "Taper Tantrum."
But the sell-offs were relatively short lived. Markets recovered, and more important, the global financial system avoided a serious crisis.

Economic Tumult In Turkey Is Test For an Autocrat

Full text: ISTANBUL -- President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has long made clear that he considered no part of Turkish life beyond his reach, not least the economy. Even before he was re-elected in June with sultan-like powers, he had built his popularity on sustained economic growth fueled by signature megaprojects -- the latest being plans for a canal bisecting the country. But critics have long charged that much of that expansion was built on budgetary sleight of hand, cronyism and corruption.
Now Turkey's worst economic crisis since 2001 -- the currency hit another new low on Monday -- has confronted Mr. Erdogan with the limits of his authoritarian approach and could end his long run of success.
It is also fanning fears of a global contagion, as Turkey's troubles undermine investor confidence in other emerging market economies and raise concerns about the exposure of banks even in developed regions, like the European Union.
Turkey's economic troubles, analysts say, are largely of Mr. Erdogan's own making. They have less to do with his dispute with the United States and the prospect of greater sanctions than with Mr. Erdogan's deepening economic interference as he attempts to bend the logic of monetary policy and global financial markets to suit his political purposes.
Yet while Mr. Erdogan asserts greater control over life in Turkey -- including the media, the judiciary, foreign policy and political decision-making -- it is far less clear that he can bully an economy increasingly beholden to global markets to submit to his will, they say.
Business leaders warn that the many strands of the president's authoritarian approach are intertwined, and that Turkey will not climb out of its hole until the country enacts major structural reforms that would undo many of Mr. Erdogan's constraints.
Those would include allowing a free press, an independent judiciary and returning powers to Parliament. Another step, the release of political prisoners, would help repair relations with Europe.
"We have to do something at home," said Umit Pamir, a former ambassador to NATO. "Only then can investors come."
While Mr. Erdogan could still change course, whether he will is far from certain. In the meantime, the levers available to him will not avert the economic pain that is now inevitable, they say.
"The interest-rate hikes and budget cuts will be painful," said Atilla Yesilada, an Istanbul-based consultant at Global Source Partners, a management consultancy. "There will be bankruptcies."
Many analysts say that, as he has accumulated power, Mr. Erdogan has become increasingly isolated, surrounding himself with advisers who reinforce his own views, while sidelining real expertise.
In particular, Mr. Erdogan has insisted on following a policy of keeping interest rates low to allow a huge program of fiscal stimulus based around the construction industry to generate high growth.
In May, in an interview with Bloomberg TV, Mr. Erdogan explained why he wanted more control over the central bank and interest-rate policy.
"When the people fall into difficulties because of monetary policies, who are they going to hold accountable?" he asked. "Since they'll ask the president about it, we have to give off the image of a president who is influential on monetary policies," he added.
"It is the fundamental view of the true populist," explained Sinan Ulgen, chairman of the Istanbul-based Center for Economic and Foreign Policy Studies, also known as E.D.A.M. "The fact of his being elected gives him the right to be responsible for all executive authority."
Yet most economists argue that the policy is no longer tenable and that the economy is already in recession amid mounting foreign debts and a current account deficit. Keeping interest rates low is driving up inflation, which is hurting people's pocketbooks.
For months credit-rating agencies and investment specialists have been signaling that the political management of Turkey's economy is scaring away investment.
Turkey has weathered financial storms before thanks to its size and diversity, but the outcome will depend on the "coherence and predictability of the policies that are pursued," the credit-rating agency Moody's advised in a statement in June.
In July, after Mr. Erdogan's re-election, and after he appointed his son-in-law Berat Albayrak to the newly combined position of treasury and finance minister, Moody's announced another downgrading of Turkey's credit rating.
"Any perception of encroachment into the independence of the central bank and other public institutions will likely exacerbate investor concerns," it wrote in a statement.
Since the election, Mr. Erdogan has passed a flurry of decrees bringing the system of government under the president's control.
The changes center power increasingly in Mr. Erdogan's hands, allowing him to appoint senior officials in almost every area of life. Far beyond the central bank, analysts warn, the changes represent a creeping politicization of the state.
Among the changes is the elimination of senior Civil Service positions in the powerful Turkish bureaucracy.
Turkey has always had a strong bureaucracy, modeled on the French system, with a senior bureaucrat, called an under secretary, in every ministry, assisted by deputy under secretaries. Those positions have been eliminated and the civil servant positions replaced with deputy ministers appointed by Mr. Erdogan.
The change is being felt across the administration, Mr. Ulgen said. "There is no top bureaucrat who sees 360 degrees," he said. "It is all silos."
Any positive gain from bringing outsiders into the administration has been tempered by the polarizing nature of Mr. Erdogan's rule, which has increasingly pushed out people who are seen as ideologically or politically opposed to his Justice and Development Party, and favored party loyalists.
"There's going to be a convergence of the party and the state, more so than in the past, and the top bureaucrat representing the state will not be there," Mr. Ulgen added. "The lower levels of the bureaucracy will be open to politicization as career advancement will be increasingly linked to political affiliation."
Yet relying on the party for appointees excludes a vast pool of talent, something that has also been evident with the purges of 150,000 public employees since the failed coup of 2016.
The appointment of Mr. Albayrak to the post of treasury and finance minister has been taken as a signal not only of Mr. Erdogan's determination to control monetary and fiscal policy, but also of his intention to prepare a dynasty.
Mr. Albayrak, 40, holds an M.B.A. from Pace University in New York, and worked as the United States representative for Calik Holdings, a Turkish construction and trading company known for its close links to the government.
In 2004 he married Esra, Mr. Erdogan's eldest daughter, who studied at the University of California at Berkeley, and two years later they returned to Turkey.
Mr. Albayrak entered politics in 2015, becoming a member of Parliament, and later that year was appointed energy minister. He was appointed treasury and finance minister to the new cabinet after the June 24 elections.
Even as the business world regretted the departure of more experienced officials from the government, some hoped that Mr. Albayrak, being a relative, might be able to persuade Mr. Erdogan to moderate his insistence on keeping interest rates low.
But so far Mr. Albayrak has not done enough to stem the damage, Mr. Yesilada said.
At a news briefing Friday, Mr. Albayrak gave assurances of the independence of the Central Bank, yet that the fact that the bank failed to act to shore up the lira showed it was either not independent, or amiss at its job, he said.
"No Central Bank would stand by while its currency is depreciating," he said.
Mr. Albayrak was undergoing a "fast on-the-job training," he said. "If the business community and banks tell him what dire straits we are navigating, he may make the right decision."
As for the immediate crisis, Mr. Yesilada called for a hefty interest rate hike of at least 5 percentage points and said that a "handshake with the United States is an absolute minimum."
Ankara kept asking for other options to the crisis, he said, but he predicted that Mr. Erdogan would have no option in the end.
"He will wake up and smell the coffee," he said.

Full text: Turkey's currency fell to another record low on Monday, hitting stocks in Europe and Asia and raising fears that the country is on the verge of an economic meltdown that could spread to other emerging markets. The crisis, caused by soaring inflation, economic mismanagement by the Turkish government and tensions with the United States, has raised concerns over whether emerging economies that have benefited in recent years from foreign investment may also be vulnerable.
Rising interest rates in the United States and in Europe have made investors less tolerant of emerging markets. Foreign investors piled money into Turkish assets for years, lured by what appeared to be a stable economy and higher returns. But as interest rates rise in countries seen as safer, the relative attractiveness of riskier investments wanes. A crisis like the one in Turkey may be all it takes to send them fleeing.
Turkey's central bank insisted over the weekend that it would "take all necessary measures" to preserve the country's financial stability. But it has so far refused to raise interest rates, and the changes it has pushed through thus far have been limited in scope.
After the Turkish lira fell even further -- one dollar bought 3.8 liras at the start of the year, but at one point on Monday it was worth 7.2 liras -- investors dumped other emerging-market currencies. The Indian rupee dropped to a record low against the dollar, the Indonesian rupiah flirted with a three-year low, and the South African rand lost 2 percent after falling nearly 6 percent last week.
Stock markets across Asia, including in Hong Kong; Seoul, South Korea; Shanghai; and Tokyo, fell on Monday, with many exchanges dropping nearly 2 percent during the day. European markets fared only slightly better. The euro hovered around its lowest point against the dollar in a year.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lagged for much of the day, and closed down 0.4 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.5 percent.
"Turkey's woes can ripple out to hammer European Union institutions," Carl Weinberg, chief international economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, N.Y., said in a note to clients on Monday.
Shares of European banks suffered some of the biggest losses, including BBVA of Spain and UniCredit of Italy, which have large holdings in Turkey, and lenders such as Commerzbank and Deutsche Bank, which do not have major operations there.
Investors were driven principally by fears of contagion, the notion that an economic or financial crisis in one country -- in this case, Turkey -- can quickly spread to other regions.
Problems in Turkey have been brewing for years, but Turkish assets have fallen steeply in recent days as questions have mounted over the country's prospects. Price increases have quickened, and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had undertaken increasingly authoritarian moves, from the appointment of a relative as an important minister to the erosion of the central bank's independence.
Normally, a country in Turkey's situation would raise interest rates to stifle inflation and stop the currency's slide. But Mr. Erdogan's popularity has hinged on rapid growth fueled by credit, and he has often spoken against raising interest rates.
Still, Turkey has political and economic problems not found elsewhere, and analysts were not yet ready to predict widespread panic.
"In the very short term, we are seeing what we would describe as 'risk off' toward emerging markets," said Stuart Culverhouse, global head of macro and fixed income research at Exotix Capital, a research firm in London.
But "Turkey is following a path many other emerging markets aren't," he added. "I don't think it's going to lead to a more systemic problem across emerging markets."
On Monday, Turkey's central bank relaxed some of its rules on the money that commercial banks must keep on reserve, freeing up cash to deal with the currency crisis. The central bank also said that it would provide "all the liquidity the banks need."
But it made no mention of raising the benchmark interest rate, which is already at 17.75 percent. Though high compared with other countries, it is only slightly above the rate of inflation and would have to be much higher to squelch rising prices.
In a speech in the city of Trabzon on Sunday, Mr. Erdogan called on businesses to show solidarity in supporting the lira.
"Do not prefer to rush to banks and buy foreign currency," he said. "You would do the wrong thing if you resort to such options just to be on the safe side. You should know that it is both our and industrialists' and merchants' responsibility to keep this nation on its feet. Otherwise, we would have to implement Plan B or Plan C."
Yet in a sign of nervousness in Turkey, rumors spread on social media that the Plan B or C would involve restrictions on foreign exchange bank accounts. The treasury and finance minister, Berat Albayrak denied the rumors in a post on Twitter late Sunday, and the semiofficial Anadolu news agency later reported that Turkey's interior ministry had opened investigations into 346 social media accounts officials said had helped "manipulate perceptions" about the lira.
Compounding the fear in financial markets, there is a lack of information about which foreign banks may own Turkish government bonds or have lent money to Turkish companies. About 90 percent of Turkey's public and private sector debt with foreign lenders is in foreign currencies, according to the International Monetary Fund.
Those debts in dollars, euros or other foreign currencies will quickly become unsustainable for borrowers that do not have corresponding revenue in those currencies.
A worsening diplomatic dispute with the United States has also piled on the pressure for Turkey. Though tensions initially centered on the detention of an American pastor, they have since spread into the trade arena.
President Trump pledged on Friday to double the rate of tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Turkey. The comment, which was made in a Twitter post, spooked markets concerned that Mr. Trump could take a similar approach with other trading partners.
"The catalyst for market volatility has been geopolitical uncertainties and trade," said Viraj Patel, a foreign-currency strategist at ING. "This is another knock for global markets and, taken together, it's a pretty toxic environment."
China's currency, the renminbi, which has been a casualty of Mr. Trump's trade policies for weeks, also weakened further against the dollar on Monday. The government in Beijing, which keeps a firm grip on the value of its currency, weakened the renminbi by 0.34 percent against the dollar, setting the benchmark rate for trading in Shanghai at its weakest level in 15 months.
China's main stock index lost nearly 2 percent at one point on Monday, but it closed down 0.3 percent. The reaction was stronger in other Asian markets: In Tokyo, the main index fell 2 percent. Stocks in Seoul fell 1.5 percent. A broad index of Europe's biggest companies was down 0.4 percent in afternoon trading.
A strengthening dollar is the biggest concern for officials in China and in other emerging markets. The upheaval in Turkey has fortified the dollar even further.
Despite the panic in markets, one economist at Deloitte said he believed that uncertainty about Turkey did not signal a global contagion, yet. Turkey's economy is only the 17th-largest in the world, and it is not as integrated into the global financial system as countries like China and the United States.
"I'm a little concerned, but I wouldn't be pressing the panic button," the economist, Xu Sitao, said.

Full text: When Republicans were pitching a massive tax cut for corporations and wealthy families last year, they promised voters many benefits: increased investment, higher wages and a tax cut that pays for itself. The tax plan, congressional leaders said, would turbocharge the American economy and provide a much-needed helping hand to working-class families. "Most people, half the people in this country, live paycheck to paycheck, so there's a lot of economic anxiety," the House speaker, Paul Ryan, told The Times in November. "And I think just one of the key solutions is faster economic growth, more jobs. And I think the best thing we could do to deliver that is tax reform."
So, more than six months since President Trump signed the tax cut into law, is it delivering on the promises Mr. Ryan and other leaders made?
BUYBACKS REACH NEW HEIGHTS
The most notable outcome of the tax law is one that few Republicans talk about: Companies are buying back their own stock -- a lot of it. Stock buybacks are expected to reach a record $1 trillion this year. Since Congress reduced the top federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, businesses are flush with cash. Lawmakers also let companies repatriate foreign earnings that they had been amassing at a rate of 15.5 percent for cash and 8 percent for other assets.
By buying back shares, businesses are boosting demand for, and thus the price of, their stock. It's no wonder, then, that the S.&P. 500 stock index is trading near its high.
Share buybacks have an understandable appeal to executives, many of whom are compensated with stock, and to investors. But buybacks do little for workers, most of whom own little or no stock. It is not even clear that buybacks are in the long-term interest of companies since that money could be used to expand into new markets or invest in technology.
In fact, these buybacks amount to a huge wasted opportunity. And this waste wasn't unexpected. In 2004, Republicans temporarily cut the tax rate on foreign corporate profits, promising that the tax break would spur economic growth and increase wages. Instead, many corporations bought record amounts of their own shares.
INVESTMENTS HAVE FLATLINED
With so many firms focusing on buying back stock, a central Republican prediction -- that tax cuts would encourage spending on equipment and factories -- has not come to fruition. There has been a modest increase in investment this year compared with recent quarters. Companies in the S.&P. 500 had spent around $147 billion through the end of March. A recent modest uptick began in early 2017, long before the tax cut.
Investment as a percentage of economic output climbed in the first quarter but fell to 17.5 percent in the second, far below the nearly 20 percent it reached in 2006 before the recession. Growth in productivity -- which ought to accelerate when businesses invest -- was just 0.4 percent in the first quarter.
REAL WAGES HAVE DECLINED
And what happened to that promise of big raises for workers? There has been no sign of them yet.
The typical family would earn $3,000 to $7,000 more a year, the White House Council of Economic Advisers predicted. In fact, real wages are down, largely thanks to the rising price of oil, which has more than offset any increase in income.
Even ignoring inflation, wages are up only 2.7 percent over the last 12 months. Even with the unemployment rate at a low 3.9 percent, businesses are not offering higher pay yet.
The idea that the tax cuts were going to line workers' pockets was always a mirage. Most people will enjoy only a modest and temporary tax cut -- families making between $48,600 and $86,100 will save $930, according to the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. Families in the top 1 percent, on the other hand, will save an average of $51,140.
TAX CUTS DON'T PAY FOR THEMSELVES
"Not only will this tax plan pay for itself, but it will pay down debt," Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said. This statement was absurd when Mr. Mnuchin made it, but it looks even more ridiculous now. The deficit and the federal debt are growing -- and at a stunning pace. In the current fiscal year, the federal government will spend $912 billion more than it collects in revenue, an increase of 39 percent from the 2017 fiscal year, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
Thanks to the tax cut, the government will take in about 1 percent less in the 2018 fiscal year than it did the year before. Corporate tax revenue is plummeting -- the C.B.O. predicts a drop of 27 percent this year. At the same time, the federal government will spend nearly 5 percent more, due, in large part, to Mr. Trump's insistence on more military spending.
Over the coming decades, the federal debt could nearly triple as a share of the gross domestic product if Congress makes the Trump tax cuts and spending increases permanent, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. Lawmakers have talked about extending the cuts in last year's law beyond the next 10 years -- something they did with some of the cuts passed during the George W. Bush administration.
Today, many Republicans seem to realize that the tax cut has become a political liability, which is why they aren't talking about it ahead of the November election. Even they realize that it hasn't done any of what they promised.

The Trouble With Trucking

Full text: The economy is booming. The stock market is frothy. Corporations are earning record profits. Yet workers are getting minuscule raises that don't make up for the rising cost of living. What gives?
To understand how this disparity came to be, consider the plight of long-distance truck drivers. They spend weeks away from home, crisscrossing the country to keep store shelves stocked and the economy humming. The trucking industry complains it can't find enough drivers. And yet the value of drivers' paychecks just keeps falling over time.
The 1.7 million heavy and tractor-trailer truck drivers in the United States earned an average of $44,500 last year, according to government data. That's little changed in inflation-adjusted terms over the past several years. Over the past several decades, inflation-adjusted driver pay has fallen sharply. The 1980 census found that the average male driver -- virtually all drivers at the time were men -- earned roughly $17,400 in 1979, or about $55,500 in 2017 dollars. That pay drop has coincided with drivers working longer hours -- 60- to 80-hour weeks are common, drivers and researchers say -- because they spend many more idle hours than they used to at warehouses and stores waiting to pick up cargo and make deliveries, time that typically goes unpaid.
Many truck drivers are paid on a per-mile basis, which means that some of them earn less than the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour. The economics of trucking can be bleaker still for drivers who are classified as independent contractors. Some even wind up owing trucking companies money because a truck lease, insurance, fuel and other expenses can add up to more than their per-mile reimbursement rate, a phenomenon that Steve Viscelli, a sociologist at the University of Pennsylvania, detailed in his 2016 book "The Big Rig: Trucking and the Decline of the American Dream."
Dominic Oliveira has firsthand experience with this problem. Mr. Oliveira, 33, spent a little over a year working for New Prime, a trucking company based in Springfield, Mo., in 2013 and 2014, much of that time as an independent contractor. Some weeks he owed the company money after driving more than 1,000 miles. He made so little that he couldn't always afford rent, and he spent long stretches -- six months, at one point -- living out of his truck. Mr. Oliveira's contract said he was free to drive for other trucking companies, but there were numerous conditions that effectively bound him to New Prime. A federal class-action lawsuit Mr. Oliveira filed against the company says that New Prime controlled his schedule and his ability to haul cargo for other companies. To work for other companies, he would have had to reregister his truck and get a new insurance policy, an arduous undertaking given the long periods he spent on the road.
"This is not a glamorous job by any means," Mr. Oliveira, who now works for a different trucking company, near Memphis, said in a telephone interview. "But if you put the time and effort in, you should be going somewhere. But a lot of us don't. It's insane how many friends of mine in the last five years have gotten divorced and lost everything because a company held back their pay, saying they owe them money."
Mr. Oliveira's lawsuit seeks back pay for himself and other contractor drivers. The company has sought to have the suit thrown out, arguing that the company's contract with Mr. Oliveira requires him to submit disputes to arbitration. But a Federal District Court and the United States Court of Appeals in Boston ruled that Mr. Oliveira could bring his case in federal court because the 1925 Federal Arbitration Act exempts transportation workers. New Prime, which declined through its lawyer to comment on Mr. Oliveira's allegations, has appealed the case to the Supreme Court, which will hear arguments in October.
The American Trucking Associations, citing its own research, claims that long-haul drivers with irregular routes can earn more than $53,000 a year. The group adds that many trucking companies offer signing bonuses to try to attract new workers, and that drivers who work for private corporate fleets often earn salaries of more than $86,000 a year. Indeed, drivers who work as employees of companies like Walmart and UPS make a middle-class income, have predictable schedules and enjoy other benefits. Some drivers in the industry, including at UPS, are represented by the Teamsters union. But those drivers are the top echelon of the occupation and are not representative of the hundreds of thousands of people who toil in the industry's underbelly.
Many long-haul truck drivers work for much smaller companies that pay modest rates -- for one eight-day trip in 2013, Mr. Oliveira took home $482.85 for driving 6,156 miles -- and few are unionized. These companies typically haul cargo for retailers, manufacturing companies and other businesses on a for-hire basis. They often get called at the last minute to pick up loads and compete intensely on price.
It was not always this way. The federal government began deregulating the trucking industry in the 1970s and 1980s, making it easier for new businesses to haul freight without seeking government approval for new routes. The previous requirements raised the cost of moving goods and stifled competition, but deregulation also took a toll on drivers by giving the industry a bigger financial incentive to lower costs and by weakening unions.
Because driver pay is low, trucking companies in the truckload segment where drivers like Mr. Oliveira work have a turnover rate of about 95 percent, said Stephen Burks, a professor of economics at the University of Minnesota at Morris. (Mr. Burks also once worked as a truck driver.) Fear of recessions -- and being stuck with high labor costs -- make many companies reluctant to raise wages even if doing so would reduce turnover.
Desiree Wood, a driver who founded the group Real Women in Trucking, said that she once earned as little as 22 cents a mile as a driver for a trucking company in Tennessee. "If everybody is quitting, and they have a labor shortage, it's probably because it is a crappy job," she said.
Ms. Wood now has her own one-woman trucking operation and refuses jobs that don't pay enough for her to break even -- her cutoff is about $1.60 per mile. But she said it took her years to figure that out. Many younger people are lured into the profession by promises of bonuses and the freedom to work when they want, only to be disappointed by the reality of a grueling, underpaid job.
Not only is the trucking industry's low-cost strategy hard on workers, but some experts say it also makes roads less safe by compelling workers to drive when they should rest. After spending many unpaid hours waiting to pick up a load, drivers put in long hours behind the wheel. That's because it's the only time they earn money, according to Michael Belzer, an economics professor at Wayne State University and the author of "Sweatshops on Wheels: Winners and Losers in Trucking Deregulation." Federal regulations prohibit truck drivers from spending more than 11 hours in a 14-hour period behind the wheel. In practice, many work much more than that because nondriving hours are not counted.
If the industry raised wages, it's clear that employers would find a larger labor pool. Instead, lobbyists for the industry are pushing the Trump administration to lower the minimum age for commercial driver's licenses to 18 from 21. The administration seems receptive: Last month, the Department of Transportation announced that it wanted to move ahead on a pilot project that would allow 18-year-olds with the military equivalent of a commercial driver's license to haul freight across state lines.
These are dangerous ideas. Lowering the age requirement could make roads less safe: Studies have consistently shown that teenagers are much more likely to be involved in fatal and other accidents. It makes little sense, then, to encourage younger people to get behind the wheel of a big rig weighing more than 33,000 pounds.
Imagine, however, that the government instead decided to use its prodding power to improve the lives and incomes of truck drivers. Officials could, for example, do more to crack down on companies that misclassify employees as contractors to avoid paying for expenses and guaranteeing a minimum wage. The government also ought to require that trucking companies and freight customers compensate drivers for every hour of work, including the hours spent picking up and dropping off loads. What's more, Congress could pass a law making clear that regardless of how the industry pays drivers -- whether on a per-hour or a per-mile basis -- drivers are entitled to earn minimum wage and overtime for all of the hours they put in.
Such changes would increase costs for trucking companies, their customers and, ultimately, American shoppers. But paying truck drivers a living wage would neither imperil the economy nor cause spiraling inflation -- the costs would be spread among the billions of tons of freight moved by truck each year.
Eventually, self-driving trucks might make these problems irrelevant by replacing drivers altogether. But experts agree that drivers will still be needed for many years. Computers will not be able to navigate all driving conditions, nor can they perform other job functions, like loading and unloading cargo. The trials for drivers aren't going away for the foreseeable future.
Despite the bleak economics of their chosen occupation, many drivers don't want to quit trucking. They are loath to trade in the cab of a big rig, and all the autonomy it offers, for an office cubicle or a factory floor. And they like seeing places that they may never have traveled to otherwise.
They also are increasingly frustrated that they are not fairly compensated for their work.
"I love what I do," Mr. Oliveira said, "but there needs to be change in the industry for the next generation."

Full text: Stocks in the United States and Europe skidded on Friday as investors worried about the financial stability of Turkey and how it might affect the global banking system. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey has accumulated more and more control over the country's central bank as well as its financial system, which is now run by his son-in-law. Its currency is plunging, and Turkey is also in a diplomatic spat with the United States, a major trading partner.
Alex Dryden, global markets strategist for JPMorgan Asset Management, said that Mr. Erdogan showed no signs of changing course, and that investors were losing hope that Turkey's government has the knowledge or independence needed to deal with the country's financial problems.
"There was some hope that maybe they'd step back from the brink and you'd see a re-establishment of central bank independence," he said.
While Mr. Dryden and other analysts say Turkey's problems aren't a major risk to the financial system, investors didn't wait to find out on Friday.
They sold stocks and bought United States dollars and government bonds. The bond purchases sent interest rates lower, which hurt banks. The dollar got stronger, partly because the Turkish lira nose-dived, and major exporters like technology, basic materials and industrial companies sank.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slid 20.30 points, or 0.7 percent, to 2,833.28. That was its worst loss in a month and ended a five-week winning streak for the index by wiping out its gains from earlier this week.
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 196.09 points, or 0.8 percent, to 25,313.14. The Nasdaq composite sank 52.67 points, or 0.7 percent, to 7,839.11. It had risen for eight days in a row.
The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks took a smaller loss of 4.08 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,686.80. The companies in that index are less reliant on exports, and the stronger dollar makes their imports less costly.
Investors are concerned about Mr. Erdogan's economic views. He says higher interest rates lead to higher inflation, the opposite of what standard economic theory says. As a result, he has pushed Turkey's central bank to keep interest rates low, threatening its independence and preventing it from shoring up the lira.
The United States is the biggest importer of Turkish steel, and President Trump said on Friday he would authorize higher tariffs on steel and aluminum from Turkey, a NATO ally. That sent the lira down even further. It's down 40 percent this year against the dollar.
The weakening lira has been pushing up the cost of goods for Turkish people and has damaged international investors' confidence in the country. Since some of Turkey's debt is in dollars, it's also making the country's financial situation worse.
European banks fell sharply. The United States-listed shares of Germany's Deutsche Bank lost 4.7 percent to $11.82, and Spanish Banco Santander fell 4.7 percent to $5.19.
Mr. Dryden, of JPMorgan Asset Management, said Mr. Erdogan had replaced independent advisers and leaders with relatives and supporters and set off a "gradual process of eroding economic credibility among financial and economic institutions."
Bond prices jumped. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.87 percent from 2.93 percent. That helped send bank stocks lower. JPMorgan Chase slid 1 percent to $115.73, and Citigroup retreated 2.4 percent to $70.26.
Emerging market currencies fell, and the dollar increased. The ICE U.S. Dollar Index was already trading around annual highs, and it rose another 0.9 percent, a large move.
The euro fell to $1.1398, its lowest in more than a year, from $1.1542. The dollar fell to 110.64 yen from 111.04 yen after a strong economic growth report form Japan.
Germany's DAX fell 2 percent, and the CAC 40 in France fell 1.6 percent. Britain's FTSE 100 lost 1 percent. The Nikkei 225 index in Japan lost 1.3 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng gave up 0.8 percent. In South Korea, the Kospi lost 0.9 percent.
Energy companies rose slightly as oil prices increased. Benchmark U.S. crude oil rose 1.2 percent to $67.63 a barrel in New York, and Brent crude rose 1.1 percent to $72.83 a barrel in London.
Gold dipped 0.1 percent to $1,219 an ounce.

Tempted to Reap Short-Term Perks From New Tax Laws? Not So Fast

Full text: Talk to a tax expert long enough and you're likely to hear some variant on this phrase: Don't let the tail wag the dog. It makes sense. Focus too much on the details, and you may lose sight of the big picture. When it comes to taxes -- the tail in this case -- a short-term tax benefit may not be the best investment or lifestyle decision.
The tax overhaul that was rushed through the Republican-controlled Congress and enacted last year gave taxpayers little time to grasp its implications. As the new law now becomes understood, accountants and tax advisers say the tail is wagging like an excited Labrador hovering over a T-bone steak. And advisers say their job is to calm the dog before he does something he will regret.
"You have to be careful making permanent decisions based on a temporary law," said Mitchell Drossman, national director of wealth planning strategies at U.S. Trust. "This tax law is a temporary provision because most of the individual tax provisions sunset at the end of 2025."
In many cases, once these tax-driven decisions are made, they either cannot be undone or they will cost people more than they saved to undo them. And it is not limited to the very wealthy; middle- and upper-middle-class earners could fall into this trap.
Short-term benefits may look desirable, but here are three tax breaks that may be better in the long run.
Estate Tax
For the very wealthy, a key question is whether to make substantial gifts to heirs now or to leave it to them later in a will. It has become a big issue because the estate and gift tax exemption is now $11 million per person or $22 million for a couple -- more than double what it was last year.
The advantage of giving it away now is that the gift can grow in an heir's estate, with only capital gains tax to worry about.
But there is a downside. Gifts made through an estate receive what is called a step-up in basis, which values the securities on the date of the giver's death. When the giver is alive, however, gifts are transferred with what is called the original basis, or purchase price; when sold, the recipient will have to pay tax on the capital gains tax stretching back to whenever the investment was originally made.
However, the math for making a large gift now is compelling, said Amanda DiChello, a partner at Cozen O'Connor's private client services group, who ran a comparison for The New York Times.
A person worth $25 million who made a $10 million gift today and lived another 10 years would save $4 million in taxes, assuming a 5 percent growth rate. If those assets were then sold, and capital gains were paid, the person would still save about $3 million. If that person lived another 20 years, the tax savings would only increase.
But basing such a large choice on taxes alone is not always easy to stomach. After all, $10 million is a large gift for anyone.
Adding to the uncertainty is the fear that such a high estate-tax exemption -- which is indexed to inflation, so it will keep growing -- will not be renewed in 2025, or will be repealed sooner by the next administration.
"Clients with $20 million to $30 million are asking, 'What do we do? We can't afford to give it all away,"' Ms. DiChello said. "But there could be a backlash. Would a new administration come and take the exemption down?"
That's the big unknown. And the cost could be millions of dollars that goes to pay taxes, not to heirs.
Robert M. Finkel, a co-chairman of the tax practice group at the law firm Moritt Hock & Hamroff and a former senior trial lawyer at the Internal Revenue Service, said he had found himself increasingly popular at cocktail parties. People want to divine what he thinks is likely to happen with the tax law, but they also want to know how to handle situations with heirs when they no longer can hide behind a lower gift exemption.
"For many years the low gift-tax exemption was the reason parents said they couldn't give any more," Mr. Finkel said. "Now, the talk around the dinner table from children is, 'Geez, why don't you make the gift now?"'
One answer is for parents to have an in-depth conversation with their children. Another, though, is to structure a transfer that allows parents to retain control of the asset during their life but still secure the deduction.
One way to achieve this is to put property worth $11 million, like a house, into a sophisticated arrangement called a qualified personal residence trust. Mr. Drossman said the parents could continue living in the home with provisions that the gift would be made to their heirs on their death.
If structured properly, the donor is considered to have made the gift at the higher amount, even if the exemption drops back to $5 million.
It's complicated, but it's also an example of uncertain tax policy driving people to make decisions they may not otherwise make.
Capital Gains Tax
The Trump administration has floated the idea of indexing the basis of an investment to inflation, which could greatly lower the taxable capital gains on an investment when it is sold. And the administration has hinted at doing it by executive order, which has raised a lot of concern. Previous administrations have entertained the same idea but decided it would need congressional approval.
Politics aside, there is a practical implication to this. In the long term, indexing an investment's purchase price to inflation could also reduce the amount of a loss a taxpayer could claim as a deduction. Not all investments rise. And the ones that lose money can be carried forward on tax returns until future gains soak them up.
In the short term, with the stock market continuing to rise, the idea of increasing that basis could be an inducement to not sell highly appreciated stock now.
"I'm a bit concerned that the administration floated this idea to create a kind of uncertainty," Mr. Finkel said. "We have a market at near-record level. Why not create uncertainty so people don't take profits off the table?"
Such thinking is likely to apply to investors in stocks with outsize gains -- like someone who bought Apple years ago. The standard recommendation from any financial adviser is to rebalance your portfolio, selling winners to maintain the weight in your financial plan.
Charitable Giving
The increase in the standard deduction to $12,000 for individuals has saved most American taxpayers from having to itemize their deductions.
Swept up in this, though, are affluent taxpayers who are charitably inclined. A $5,000 contribution to charity may no longer count beyond the deduction that anyone gets, for being charitable or not.
Alexander L. Reid, partner at the law firm Morgan Lewis, where he focuses on nonprofit organizations, said one strategy for the person who regularly gives $5,000 a year would be to front-load five years of donations into a donor-advised fund.
There are two advantages to this. The $25,000 total donation would get the taxpayer over the $12,000 hurdle, allowing the person to claim a deduction while still parceling out the donations over five years.
Additionally, if the person made the gift by transferring $25,000 of highly appreciated stock, there would be no tax on the capital gains. "It may be a good time to lock in the gains and bunch your charitable giving," Mr. Reid said.
These tax changes seem to be affecting the most taxpayers, but confusion abounds throughout the new tax code. And the government is still trying to clear things up.
On Wednesday, the I.R.S. issued a 184-page explanation of how companies structured as "pass-through" entities -- ones in which the income passes through to the owners, who pay the taxes on their individual returns -- might take advantage of a 20 percent income tax deduction.
"The fact is, no one knows what is going to happen," Mr. Finkel said. "In fact, no one thought this would happen."

Full text: ISTANBUL -- A worsening dispute between the United States and Turkey reverberated through the global economy on Friday, hastening a broad flight of money from emerging markets and sowing instability throughout the Middle East as relations between the NATO allies neared a breaking point. The immediate crisis -- accelerated by a hostile tweet from President Trump -- flared over Turkey's continued detention of an American pastor, Andrew Brunson, who was jailed 21 months ago in a widespread crackdown after a failed coup in Turkey.
But the outsize effect reflected deepening concerns over Turkey's economic management by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who was re-elected in June with near-authoritarian powers. It also increased the risk that the problems in Turkey, which borders Iran, Iraq and Syria, could destabilize economies well beyond the region.
Turkey's economy is only the 17th largest in the world, but its problems are worsening as Mr. Trump's trade war is rattling global commerce, damaging longtime alliances and threatening economic growth worldwide.
There is also widespread fear among foreign investors that the populist, authoritarian government of Mr. Erdogan is pursuing irresponsible economic policies while undercutting the independence of the central bank. That, analysts fear, is preventing the country from taking the necessary steps to put the economy on a more stable footing.
Turkey's currency, the lira, which traded at 4.7 to the dollar a month ago, weakened to 6.4 to the dollar on Friday -- the first time ever that it took more than 6 lira to buy a dollar. The lira has lost more than 30 percent of its value this month -- roughly half of it this week.
Seeming to sense vulnerability, Mr. Trump piled on pressure and announced additional economic sanctions -- doubling tariffs on imported Turkish steel to 50 percent and on aluminum to 20 percent -- after having already penalized two Turkish government ministers last week.
The move effectively priced Turkish steel out of the American market, which accounts for 13 percent of Turkey's steel exports.
"Our relations with Turkey are not good at this time!" Mr. Trump wrote.
The deepening standoff raised questions of whether the two strong-willed leaders were risking even broader chaos as they vied for the upper hand in a widening diplomatic dispute largely focused on individual personalities.
An evangelical preacher, Mr. Brunson, who has lived in Turkey for 23 years, is one of about 20 Americans, including a NASA scientist and chemistry professor from Pennsylvania, who have been swept up in Mr. Erdogan's crackdown since the failed coup two years ago.
Mr. Erdogan says the coup was orchestrated from the United States, and specifically by a Muslim cleric, Fethullah Gulen, from his self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania. Turkish authorities have demanded that he be extradited, something American officials have dismissed, and the detained Americans are widely seen as bargaining chips.
Mr. Erdogan has shown no sign of backing down. He sounded defiant in two speeches to supporters on Friday, railing against foreign powers that he accused of orchestrating Turkey's economic crisis, and vowing not to bow to Western pressure.
"Those who believe they can make us kneel by economic manipulation, have never understood this nation at all," he told a crowd in Gumushane, a province on Turkey's northern Black Sea coast. "They can't use threatening language, blackmailing language against this nation. Especially bullying will not cut it with our nation."
After watching Mr. Erdogan on live television, Asli Aydintasbas, senior fellow with the European Council on Foreign Relations, said, "They have no deal, their positions have hardened."
The breakdown was surprising, she said, because Mr. Trump had appeared to reach the outlines of an agreement for the pastor's release with Mr. Erdogan on the sidelines of the NATO summit last month.
In exchange, the United States agreed to arrange for the Turkish banker, Mehmet Hakan Atilla, who is serving a 32-month prison term in the United States, to be returned to serve the remainder of his sentence in Turkey.
After his meeting with Mr. Erdogan, Mr. Trump even threw in an extra favor, asking Israel to release a Turkish detainee, Ebru Ozkan, who was quickly freed.
Washington wanted Mr. Brunson released immediately, but the formalities of the Turkish banker's transfer were expected to take two or three weeks, according to Ms. Aydintasbas.
The deal has not happened, she said, as Turkey has held out for further guarantees, including the lowering of a fine by the United States Treasury against the state-owned Turkish bank Halkbank for conspiring to violate United States sanctions against Iran, and a promise to cease any further prosecutions.
According to one American official, Turkey had been given a deadline to release Mr. Brunson, who is now under house arrest at his home in the Turkish coastal city of Izmir, by 6 p.m. Wednesday.
Turkey had seemed to be trying to stave off the crisis by scrambling a delegation to travel to Washington for more talks that day.
The talks did not go well, said a second American official.
"The conversations continue," said Heather Nauert, the State Department spokeswoman, after the discussions.
By Friday Mr. Erdogan seemed determined to tough it out. He called on Turks to sell their gold and dollars and buy lira to bolster the Turkish currency.
"Those who have dollars, euros, gold under their pillows, should go and change them in our banks for the Turkish Lira," he said. "This is a national struggle."
"Erdogan has made a decision," Ms. Aydintasbas said. "His speech was clearly very defiant."
Yet Turkey's economic situation looked increasingly fragile.
The lira's plunge has sent shudders through financial markets because it has raised doubts about investing in Turkish securities. The yield on Turkish 10-year bonds has risen sharply, to more than 20 percent, which means traders are demanding much higher returns for what they see as an increasingly risky investment.
The anxiety extended to doubts about Asian and European banks that have heavily invested in Turkey, and it contributed to declines in stock markets around the world. As with the financial crisis set off by Greece in 2010, Friday's events were the latest example of how troubles in a nation with a midsize economy but world-class problems could threaten financial stability further afield.
"In financial markets everything is interlinked," said Bart Hordijk, a market analyst in Amsterdam at Monex Europe, a foreign exchange firm. "You don't know if one bank has huge exposure to the Turkish lira."
As a result, Mr. Hordijk said, "People scramble to safer assets."
In power for 15 years already, Mr. Erdogan's popularity has depended greatly on his ability to bring Turks continued economic growth. It has created a middle class beholden to him, even as he has trimmed civil liberties, jailed opponents, and constrained traditional and social media alike.
He called snap elections this year, a year and a half ahead of schedule, driven in part by signs that the economy was faltering. Yet the lira plunged even in the midst of his re-election campaign.
The economic trouble has only worsened in the weeks since Mr. Erdogan acquired sweeping executive powers after his re-election to a newly enhanced presidential system in June.
The currency's sharp decline has reflected concerns about the fundamentals of Mr. Erdogan's economic model, which has depended on a voracious construction industry that his opponents say has enriched his inner circle while heaping debt on the country.
The even steeper fall in the lira since Mr. Erdogan's re-election is now fueled by worries that he is ever more insulated and is taking no one's economic advice but his own.
In an example of his increased role, he has resisted calls for a rise in interest rates to curb inflation and to ease pressure on the lira.
Berat Albayrak, Mr. Erdogan's son-in-law, who has been appointed to the combined post of Treasury and Finance Minister, attempted to calm markets with a briefing to the news media.
He insisted that Turkey would respect the independence of the Central Bank even as Mr. Erdogan's interference in monetary policy has been one of the causes of the fall of the lira, and that its economy would even show positive growth this year.
"Turkey will go further with its friends and with those who say 'We are for winning with Turkey,"' he said. "Turkey has a very strong banking sector, it is well prepared to these kind of scenarios with its capital structure."
Turkey also announced that Mr. Erdogan had held a telephone call with Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin, on Friday to discuss economic ties amid the market turmoil, The Associated Press reported. Mr. Erdogan, who has often touted his relationship with Russia as a signal that he has an alternative to relations with the West, said they discussed Russian tourism to Turkey.
The minister of trade, Ruhsar Pekcan, reacted the news of the new sanctions in measures tones, pleading for a return to negotiations.
"Turkey is deeply disappointed by the U.S. Administration's decision to double steel and aluminum tariffs," he said in a statement. "The tariffs were groundless when they were announced in June, and remain so now."
"The effects of this ill-advised action by the U.S. Administration will not only impact Turkey, but will prove detrimental to American companies and workers as well."
"We implore President Trump to return to the negotiating table -- this can and should be resolved through dialogue and cooperation."

Full text: Major indexes in the United States held steady for the third consecutive day Thursday as gains for retailers were canceled out by losses for banks and other companies.
Energy companies again headed lower after a sharp drop in oil prices the day before. Amazon and media company Viacom led consumer-focused companies higher. The Nasdaq composite inched higher and notched its eighth gain in a row.
Banks fell along with interest rates after the Labor Department reported that wholesale prices were little changed in July. That is a sign inflation pressures weakened slightly, which could encourage the Federal Reserve to go slower in its process of raising interest rates.
Trading this week has been light and investors seem to have set aside their worries about trade tensions. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index made a solid gain on Monday but has hardly budged since then. The VIX, a measure of how much volatility investors expect, has fallen to its lowest level since early January.
"It's not that risk has gone away," said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist for TD Ameritrade. "Quantifiable risk is not there right now."
The S.&P. 500 fell in the final minutes of trading, closing down 4.12 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,853.58. The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 74.52 points, or 0.3 percent, to 25,509.23. The Nasdaq composite added 3.46 points to 7,891.78.
The Labor Department said wholesale prices were unchanged in July. Gas and food prices both slipped and soybeans prices tumbled, likely reflecting a buildup in stockpiles after China imposed tariffs on them in retaliation for duties fron the United States.
Bond prices jumped. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.93 percent from 2.96 percent. That hurt banks, as lower interest rates make long-term loans like mortgages less profitable.
Several companies traded on deal news, but most of the news was about deals that fell apart. Rite Aid called off its sale to the grocery chain Albertsons following opposition from advisory firms and one of Rite Aid's biggest shareholders. Rite Aid fell 11.5 percent to $1.54.
Walgreens tried to buy Rite Aid last year, but settled for buying about half of its stores after regulators opposed a full sale. The company has been struggling with high debt and tough competition.
Tribune Media withdrew from its planned sale to Sinclair Broadcasting and said it will sue Sinclair for breach of contract. Both stocks plunged in mid-July when the Federal Communications Commission expressed major concerns about the deal.
Tribune rose 2.9 percent to $34.60, and Sinclair added 2.6 percent to $27.80.
Electric car maker Tesla tumbled 4.8 percent to $352.45. The stock surged 11 percent Tuesday, mostly because its chief executive, Elon Musk, tweeted that he was considering taking Tesla private.
The Wall Street Journal has reported that the Securities and Exchange Commission has opened an inquiry into the wording and the method of Musk's announcement, while Bloomberg News reported that the agency started an inquiry even before the tweet.
Tesla has given up most of Tuesday's gain, suggesting investors are dubious about the potential deal.
Business information provider Dun & Bradstreet agreed to be bought by a group of investors for $145 a share, or about $5.4 billion. The stock rallied 15.8 percent to $142.21.
The S.&P. 500 is on track for its sixth weekly gain in a row as an unusually strong round of corporate earnings winds down. Retailers including Macy's and Walmart are scheduled to report their results next week, and Kinahan, of TD Ameritrade, said stocks could resume their upward climb if those companies say shoppers are still spending freely.
Online reviews company Yelp jumped 26.7 percent to $48.33 after it raised its revenue forecast and said advertising revenue surged in the second quarter. Video streaming company Roku climbed 21.3 percent to $57.32 after it took a smaller loss than analysts expected while its revenue surpassed expectations.
Travel site Booking Holdings lost 5 percent to $1,942.39 after a weak profit forecast. Generic drugmaker Perrigo cut its forecasts because of weak results from its prescription business and said it plans to split that unit into a separate company. The stock sank 10.6 percent to $70.03.
Benchmark United States crude oil dipped 0.2 percent to $66.81 a barrel in New York, stabilizing after a 3 percent drop a day earlier.
The dollar inched up to 111.04 yen from 110.96 yen. The euro fell to $1.1529 from $1.1612.
Gold lost 70 cents to $1,211.90 an ounce.

Full text: Stocks in the United States climbed Tuesday for the fourth straight day as strong earnings continued to pull the market closer to the record high it set in late January.
Industrial companies rose and banks moved higher as interest rates increased. Gains for Microsoft and Google's parent company, Alphabet, helped technology companies.
Hertz, Etsy and Mosaic climbed after their results surpassed investors' forecasts. Tesla surged after its chief executive, Elon Musk, said he might take the company private.
The S.&P. 500-stock index rose 8.05 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,858.45. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 126.73 points, or 0.5 percent, to 25,628.91. The Nasdaq gained 23.99 points, or 0.3 percent, to 7,883.66. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks edged up 3.99 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,688.30.
The S.&P. 500 closed at a record high on Jan. 26. After that, it dropped 10 percent in nine days as investors worried about signs that inflation was accelerating. That hasn't materialized, but trade fears have weighed on the market since then.
Hertz soared 24.6 percent to $19.53, its biggest gain in almost a decade. But even with that huge gain, the stock is still down 12 percent for the year.
A little more than four years ago, Hertz stock traded above $120 a share. It plunged as the company dealt with overcapacity in the rental car market and the value of its vehicles decreased. Hertz has changed chief executives twice in four years.
Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note climbed to 2.98 percent from 2.95 percent. Banks and financial companies also climbed as interest rates rose.
Dentsply, a maker of dental products, cut its forecasts and took a $1.26 billion charge connected to its technology and equipment business. The company said sales and profit margins have been weaker than expected and it plans to restructure its business. The stock dropped 18.7 percent to $39.41.
The online real estate marketplace Zillow cut its revenue forecast for the year and said it was buying Mortgage Lenders of America. Terms were not disclosed. The stock fell 14.8 percent to $49.56.
Weight Watchers International sank 14.8 percent to $78.53. The company raised its forecasts for the year, but said it lost subscribers in the second quarter. The stock was worth about $6 per share in October 2015 when the company announced a deal with Oprah Winfrey to promote its products.
The billionaire investor Carl Icahn said the health insurer Cigna should not buy Express Scripts, the pharmacy benefits manager. He said that the $52 billion deal costs too much and that Express Scripts faces several major threats.
Mr. Icahn, who owns Cigna stock, has bet that Express Scripts stock will fall. But both stocks rose Tuesday. Express Scripts gained 2.8 percent to $78.95 and Cigna rose 0.2 percent to $188.27.
United States crude oil picked up 0.2 percent to $69.17 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the standard for international oil prices, rose 1.2 percent to $74.65 a barrel in London.
Wholesale gasoline added 1.9 percent to $2.10 a gallon. Heating oil rose 1.4 percent to $2.17 a gallon. Natural gas gained 1.3 percent to $2.90 per 1,000 cubic feet.
Gold was little changed at $1,218.30 an ounce. Silver edged up 0.2 percent to $15.37 an ounce. Copper rose 0.8 percent to $2.75 a pound.
The dollar rose to 111.43 yen from 111.40 yen. The euro rose to $1.1594 from $1.1556.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text: Like a Volkswagen Beetle mounted with a V-8 engine, the American economy has a lot more power than it can handle right now, and it's making a lot of noise. So is President Trump, who takes singular credit for a robust second-quarter rise in the gross domestic product of 4.1 percent, something that hasn't happened under any other president since ... Barack Obama. While Mr. Trump praised himself effusively -- he's good at that, isn't he? -- the stock market seemed unimpressed. Friday's announcement that 157,000 new jobs were added in July, a modest gain or perhaps a seasonal glitch, elicited an even more subdued reaction. That's because if you look down the line, there are few clear reasons to be so enthusiastic.
"Over all, we see this report as supportive of our views that the economy is currently firing on all cylinders," wrote Bricklin Dwyer, a senior economist with BNP Paribas, after the new G.D.P. numbers were announced. But there was a caveat: Mr. Dwyer said that "growth is likely peaking. Indeed, in our forecasts, [the second quarter] marks a high-water mark for growth."
For one thing, the initial jolt of the Republicans' $1.5 trillion tax cuts, mostly for corporations and the wealthy, is wearing off. Corporations have bought back $437 billion of their own shares, which leaves them that much less to invest in new production, or wages. In fact, spending on business equipment slowed.
Then there's the flattening yield curve, which the St. Louis Federal Reserve's president, James Bullard, warns could invert late this year if current conditions persist. That means short-term rates, such as those for two-year Treasury bonds, run higher than long-term rates, like the 10-year bond, a sign of pessimism that is a well-known red flag. Recessions tend to follow an inverted yield curve like a stray cat looking for a meal.
Purchases of goods drove about a third of that second-quarter economic increase, according to the St. Louis Fed. Consumers were in a spending mood this spring, an attitude that won't necessarily continue. In the prior quarter, they kept their hands in their pockets. At some point, they were spending the banks' money, though: Credit cards and other revolving loans had increased to an annual rate of 5.1 percent in June. A recent Reuters analysis found that the bottom 60 percent of income-earners have been fueling their spending, and thus the economy's, by using their savings or credit cards. They almost have to, because wage growth is expanding at a disappointing 2.7 percent annual clip -- despite evidence that employers are finally throwing a few more pennies at workers.
The prospects for wage growth ought to be good, given the tighter labor supply. But American companies have made an art form of not sharing the wealth with workers. Productivity growth has vastly outstripped real wage growth since the 1970s, according to Deutsche Bank research. Yet employees are working harder and smarter and not getting commensurately remunerated, while corporations have a record share of the national wealth. That is to say, workers have been getting ripped off.
Inflation measured by the Consumer Price Index, which is up 2.9 percent over the past year, is absorbing some of those improving wages. Consumers are also running into higher gasoline prices -- up more than 20 percent in the past year -- thanks to rising oil prices, with the prospect of volatility in the Middle East not helping. Energy is excluded from the basic C.P.I.
Given that it is the Federal Reserve's job to hold inflation to 2 percent and keep the economy from overheating, interest rates have been rising, to Mr. Trump's expressed disapproval. Most economists expect two more rate increases this year, which will make housing more expensive. That has ever more implications for the housing market, which should be expanding and contributing to economic growth. Instead, housing is getting fenced in by rising mortgage rates, as well as high prices and low inventory. You may recall what happened the last time housing slumped, in 2007. Rising interest rates also make some revolving credit more expensive.
Now consider the administration's effort to apply the sledgehammer to the economy's toes via a trade war and ensuing tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, among other products. Alcoa, the country's largest aluminum maker, as well as a big aluminum importer, said its operating earnings could take as much as a $100 million hit. Not only have the tariffs contributed to $1 billion in higher costs for General Motors, they are now contributing to rising prices of everything from Cokes to vacuum cleaners as companies pass along those costs to consumers. Some of these are easily deferred purchases, and that's what consumers are doing in the case of Electrolux.
Nor are trade wars kind to exports. Trade contributed 1.1 points to that 4.1 percent second-quarter increase, including a huge bump in pretariff soybean exports to China. Kiss that goodbye. Expect to see one percentage point of G.D.P. wiped out in the third quarter, says Ian Shepherdson, chief economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics. Take that, China.
All of this seems like a pretty poor return on investment for Mr. Trump's $1.5 trillion tax cuts, at least for most working-class Americans, who benefited least from the tax cuts. None of these issues by themselves will put the brakes on an economy that is powering along with a 3.9 percent unemployment rate. But the friction is building. And just like any powerful car engine, economic expansions -- and this one is in its 10th year -- eventually run out of gas. Expect Mr. Trump, who never runs out of gas, to blame the Democrats for that.
Mr. President, while you like to take credit for positive economic trends that are well beyond your control, you will own the downside, too.

Crisis Grips Venezuela, But It's Strengthening The President's Hand

Full text: BOGOTÁ, Colombia -- The widely circulated videos seemed to capture a presidency in free fall.
One shows President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela chased by a hungry mob brandishing pots and pans in 2016. In another, Mr. Maduro enters a plaza before Election Day in May to drum up a crowd -- but finds the square practically empty. Then there are the images from this past week: As the president's stage shakes from an explosion on Saturday, hundreds of troops break ranks and flee in panic.
This portrait of vulnerability comes as Venezuela faces the biggest economic crisis in its modern history.
And yet, Mr. Maduro has remained in power. Many are now wondering whether he hasn't only held on in spite of the disasters, but perhaps, by some measure, because of them.
"There's an area between democracy and outright dictatorship in which economic crises can actually help the leader consolidate power," said David Smilde, a sociology professor who studies Venezuela at Tulane University.
Indeed, Mr. Maduro has weathered attempted rebellions, months of mass street protests, isolation from neighboring countries, threats of military intervention from President Trump, declining oil revenues, dissent within his own party, a mass exodus of his people and an election in May, widely described as rigged, that extended his term until 2025.
Mr. Maduro has gone to great lengths to court those who might topple him, like Venezuela's military, which observers have long seen as the most powerful group that could turn on him.
As the economy collapsed, leaving the country short of food and medicine and the currency worthless, Mr. Maduro has offered the military the lucrative prizes that remain. Military leaders run the food and oil industries and control the region where gold, diamonds and coltan are mined. So far, the arrangement has secured loyalty, analysts say, as generals calculate that it is more profitable to remain aligned with the current government than to return to democracy, where their future is uncertain.
Mr. Maduro could still face the threat of street protests like those that raged in Caracas and other cities for months last year, and left more than 100 dead after the president's bloody crackdowns. Yet these days, the unrest has petered out. The rallies that still occur are less political now, and often have to do with putting pressure on local officials to restore services like water and electricity. A power failure left 80 percent of Caracas, the capital, without electricity for hours last week, and such shortages are becoming common in other cities.
Hebert García Plaza, a former general who fled the country after the Maduro government accused him of corruption, said Venezuela's security agencies now shut down protests as soon as they were planned, to prevent another outbreak of demonstrations like those in 2017.
"They remove the tumor at its source," he said, saying spy agencies now make arrests at any sign of "social unrest or attempt to rise up."
The circumstances are reminiscent of some of Latin America's strongmen of the 20th century. But there are stark differences: If then, generals stood stone-faced in dark sunglasses as military formations stood at attention, Mr. Maduro appears in constant crisis, as was on display Saturday when his national guardsmen fled the attack and he sought cover.
It is this kind of uncertainty that Mr. Maduro seems best suited at harnessing to his advantage, many argue. Dimitris Pantoulas, a political analyst and risk consultant in Caracas, expects that the alleged assassination attempt will be used as further pretext to crack down on possible opponents. The government later arrested six people who they said had made an assassination attempt on Mr. Maduro.
"I fear any crazy man may try something like this now," said Mr. Pantoulas, giving Mr. Maduro further leverage.
While Mr. Maduro may not exactly fit the model of a military dictator, he has followed an example left by the former Cuban leader Fidel Castro: He relied on the exodus of unhappy citizens as an escape valve.
Mr. Castro's reign was accompanied by two large migrations that followed his takeover of the government. The first wave was of made up of educated upper- and middle-class Cubans who opposed his 1959 revolution, and the second, of poorer Cubans who fled in boats beginning in the 1980s.
Venezuela has seen a similar migrations -- but they have taken place simultaneously.
Colombia is now home to almost a million Venezuelans, mainly poor, who have sought refuge there and in Brazil, with which Venezuela also shares a border. Educated Venezuelans have sought refuge in Europe, the United States, as well as some South American countries, like Peru and Chile, which have recruited professionals.
The upshot is changing demographics where many of Mr. Maduro's opponents are now outside the country, and many of those who remain have decided to put up with him.
"It leaves a population that is content with what's going on or tend to be more passive," said Mr. Smilde, the sociologist.
However, Mr. Smilde warns that holding onto power by taking repeated advantage of a crisis is not sustainable in the long-term.
He points to the example of the military, whose ranks have received pay increases that have well outpaced wage increases for other workers. Their raises have not, however, outpaced inflation: A typical general, Mr. Smilde estimates, earns about 250 million bolívars per month, the equivalent of $70. Other patronage measures employed by the Maduro government -- such as allowing cronies to strip state companies of assets -- have been the subject of investigations by American prosecutors.
And few economists expect that Mr. Maduro's latest proposals -- which include removing five zeros from the currency and allowing for foreign trade transactions -- will right Venezuela's economy, whose major ailment remains deep declines in oil production which Mr. Maduro has yet to resolve.
But for now, the president seems content that his formula is working. Though a protégé of the populist Hugo Chávez, Mr. Maduro now sometimes flirts with comparisons to leaders who turned to brute force to govern.
"There are people in the world who see me as the Stalin of the Caribbean," he said in a broadcast late last year. "And I look like him. Look at me in profile. Sometimes when I look in the mirror, I see Stalin."
