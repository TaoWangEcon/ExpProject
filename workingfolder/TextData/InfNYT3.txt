Full text: If you are wondering why Venezuela is back on the front pages, why the Trump administration is making such a big fuss about it, and why observers seem so anxious about the country's political crisis, then this primer is for you.
Why is Venezuela in the news right now?
There are three immediate reasons, all related to a political crisis that has been building in the country for years.
First, there were nationwide protests against the government on Wednesday. They were the first large-scale demonstrations since the president, Nicolás Maduro, reacted to the last round of large demonstrations, in 2017, with a deadly crackdown.
Second, an opposition lawmaker named Juan Guaidó declared the current government illegitimate and announced that he would be willing to lead a caretaker government. On its own, Mr. Guaidó's statement can't force any real change. But it has heightened speculation that the military could push out the government.
Third, the United States and several other governments in the Western Hemisphere have announced that they consider Mr. Guaidó to be Venezuela's legitimate leader.
Why is Venezuela in crisis?
The short version: Venezuela's government has overseen the destruction of its democracy and its economy. Public outrage is coming to a head.
Venezuela was once Latin America's richest country and one of its longest-running democracies.
Today, it is nearly a failed state. Runaway inflation has plunged much of the country into desperate poverty. Food and drug shortages are widespread. Public order is collapsing and crime rising. More than three million Venezuelans have fled the country, many as refugees.
Public anger is over more than corruption and mismanagement of the economy. The government is aggressively consolidating power and undermining democratic institutions, leaving Venezuelans without meaningful avenues for challenging or changing their leadership. So, many are taking to the streets to try to force change.
Why are things coming to a head now?
The most immediate trigger was the inauguration ceremony this month for President Nicolás Maduro. He won re-election in May in a vote that has been widely criticized within Venezuela and abroad as rigged.
Since that vote, opposition figures and foreign governments, including many in Latin America, have called Mr. Maduro's leadership illegitimate. Protesters came out after Mr. Maduro's inauguration to send the same message, hoping to pressure him to step down.
But in many ways, this is just the latest step in a crisis that has been getting steadily worse for years.
How did things in Venezuela get so bad?
We wrote a full-length explainer last year recounting Venezuela's collapse.
The shorter version starts not long after a left-wing populist named Hugo Chávez led a failed military coup in 1992, reflecting popular discontent with the political establishment. Mr. Chávez won the presidency in a 1998 election.
Initially, Mr. Chávez implemented popular changes to fight corruption and poverty. While Mr. Chávez was not wrong to see his country's political and business establishments as riven with cronyism and graft, he took them on with presidential decrees that consolidated power for himself.
Things took a turn in 2002, when an economic downturn helped prompt antigovernment protests. After violence broke out, the military detained Mr. Chávez and imposed an interim leader. Forces loyal to Mr. Chávez quickly restored order and the coup leaders quickly backed down, but Mr. Chávez returned to power bent on rooting out what he saw as enemies within.
From then until his death in 2013, Mr. Chávez waged war on Venezuelan institutions and civil society, hollowing out his country's democracy. He turned to cronyism and handouts to maintain support among his supporters and crucial allies like the military.
Mr. Maduro, his vice president, took over after Mr. Chávez's death. He was a weaker leader and therefore relied far more on handouts at a time when the government had even less money.
So Mr. Maduro simply printed more money. This drove up inflation, making basic goods unaffordable, so he instituted price controls and fixed the exchange rate. This caused shortages and made many imports prohibitively expensive. Businesses shut down. Food and medicine became scarce.
This cycle sent many Venezuelans into poverty. Many members of the police and military, who were also struggling to feed their families, turned to black marketeering. Gangs took control of city streets and the murder rate spiked to become one of the world's highest.
Can I blame Venezuela's crisis on socialism and/or Western imperialism?
That is a popular approach for many Americans (as well as Mexicans, Brazilians and other Latin Americans), who often portray Venezuela's implosion as proof that their domestic political opponents are dangerous threats.
Certainly, Mr. Chávez was a dedicated leftist who spent heavily on social programs and who nationalized much of the economy, which played into his country's crises. It's also true that the United States opposed his rule and sought to isolate his influence in Latin America, a policy that was seen by many in the region as continuing decades of imperial meddling.
But most experts on Venezuela or on the backsliding of democracies reject these explanations. Rather, they see Venezuela's crisis as having emerged from factors that can exist in any democracy, and are worsening in democracies worldwide: political polarization, distrust in institutions and desire for a strong leader to impose order.
And experts put particular focus on Mr. Chávez's anti-establishment, strongman tendencies -- something that is not particular to left- or right-wing leaders. You can read our story here on why populist leaders like Mr. Chávez, regardless of their ideologies or intentions, often steer democracies toward authoritarianism.
Does it matter that the United States recognized the opposition lawmaker as Venezuela's legitimate leader?
Maybe, but probably not by any major degree.
There is some research suggesting that a government becomes more likely to fall if people in that country view the leader as having lost international legitimacy. And Washington's recognition of Mr. Guaidó, the opposition figure, as the country's legitimate president may give him access to some Venezuelan assets that had been frozen in the United States.
Still, it was already crystal clear that President Trump's government opposed Mr. Maduro and wanted him out, so this is not a major shift. The same goes for other Latin American countries that have recognized Mr. Guaidó.
Despite some American officials hinting at a willingness to consider military force to bring down Mr. Maduro, the whispers appear unlikely to turn into action. Such an intervention would take months to execute and has no real support in the American military, the electorate or in Congress. It is not even clear what military action would be meant to accomplish or how it would do this, and it would virtually guarantee a major backlash internationally and within Venezuela.
What will happen next?
There are two sets of actors who could force Mr. Maduro to step down.
The first includes members of Mr. Maduro's own government, though the crisis has grown so bad that many of them probably fear prison or worse should they lose power. And they would lose their access to handouts, sending them into the same bread lines as everyone else.
The second would be members of the Venezuelan military, which Mr. Maduro has, perhaps wisely, avoided ordering to crack down on protesters. Some low-level officers have moved against Mr. Maduro, but the rest have remained loyal. The military benefits tremendously from the status quo; Mr. Maduro has allowed them to take control of black marketeering and some trade in natural resources.
If neither group removes Mr. Maduro and he refuses to step down, it is very hard to say what will happen. History provides few obvious parallels.
On one hand, with the situation spiraling out of control, it feels impossible that the status quo could continue. On the other, the same could have been said one, two or even three years ago, and yet Venezuela has continued its steady, tragic decline.

Full text: Russell Baker, the two-time Pulitzer Prize-winning author whose whimsical, irreverent "Observer" column appeared in The New York Times and hundreds of other newspapers for 36 years and turned a backwoods-born Virginian into one of America's most celebrated writers, died on Monday at his home in Leesburg, Va. He was 93.
The cause was complications of a fall, his son Allen said.
Mr. Baker, along with the syndicated columnist Art Buchwald (who died in 2007), was one of the best-known newspaper humorists of his time, and The Washington Post ranked his best-selling autobiography, "Growing Up," with the most enduring recollections of American boyhood -- those of James Thurber, H. L. Mencken and Mark Twain.
In a career begun in a rakish fedora and the smoky press rooms of the 1940s, Mr. Baker was a police reporter, a rewrite man and a London correspondent for The Baltimore Sun, and after 1954 a Washington correspondent for The Times, rising swiftly with a clattering typewriter and a deft writer's touch to cover the White House, Congress and the presidential campaigns of 1956 and 1960.
Then, starting in 1962, he became a columnist for The Times and its news service, eventually composing nearly 5,000 "Observer" commentaries -- 3.7 million insightful words on the news of the day -- often laced with invented characters and dialogue, on an array of subjects including dreaded Christmas fruitcake and women's shoulder pads. The columns, which generated a devoted following, critical acclaim and the 1979 Pulitzer for distinguished commentary, ended with his retirement in 1998.
To a generation of television watchers, he was also a familiar face as the host of "Masterpiece Theater" on PBS from 1993 to 2004, having succeeded Alistair Cooke.
Mr. Baker wrote 15 books, including many collections of his columns, and "Growing Up," a 1982 memoir of his Depression-era youth, his inspirational mother and America between the wars. It earned him his second Pulitzer, the 1983 prize for biography. Besides his two Pulitzer Prizes, he won two George Polk Awards, for commentary in 1978 and career achievement in 1998, and many other honors.
After his retirement from The Times, Mr. Baker wrote for The New York Review of Books on politics, history, journalism and other subjects. A collection of 11 of those essays, on revered public figures, was published in 2002 under the title "Looking Back."
Earlier, he wrote for Life, Look, Reader's Digest, The Saturday Evening Post, Ladies' Home Journal and other publications. From 1985 through 1994, he served on the Columbia University Pulitzer Prize board, selecting winners of the nation's most prestigious awards in journalism, literature and the arts. He was its chairman in 1993 and 1994.
'Ballet in a Telephone Booth'
But it was as a columnist that Mr. Baker made his name. Based at first in Washington, he recalled that he had to feel his way in the new genre of spoof and jape. "Nobody knew what the column was going to be," he told the writer Nora Ephron. "I didn't. The Times didn't."
But soon he was doing what he called his "ballet in a telephone booth," creating in the confined space of 750 words satirical dialogues, parodies and burlesques of politicians and the whirling capital circus -- then stoking the fires of the antiwar and civil rights struggles of the 1960s and the Watergate scandal that forced President Richard M. Nixon from office in 1974.
That year, Mr. Baker moved from Washington to New York, and his column changed. His topics grew more varied, less tied to news events and more to the trappings of ordinary life. His writing, admirers said, matured into literature: an owlish wit, sometimes surreal, often absurdist, usually scouring dark corridors of paradox, always carried off with a subtext of good sense.
He wrote of Francisco Franco's dying and going straight to the New York Department of Motor Vehicles. In another column, a pseudonymous Sykes tells of awakening one day to find that he has someone else's feet. Sykes conceals the shame from his wife and colleagues. Doctors are no help. Finally he confides to an editor, who signs him to a three-book contract. The feet become television celebrities. Hollywood wants Sykes's life story for a Robert Redford movie.
In 1975, after The Times's food editor and restaurant critic Craig Claiborne reported in gastronomic detail on a $4,000 31-course epicurean repast for two, with wines, in Paris, Mr. Baker wrote "Francs and Beans," describing his own culinary triumph after coming home to find a note in the kitchen saying his wife had gone out.
"The meal opened with a 1975 Diet Pepsi served in a disposable bottle," he wrote. "Although its bouquet was negligible, its distinct metallic aftertaste evoked memories of tin cans one had licked experimentally in the first flush of childhood's curiosity." And on to a "pâté de fruites de nuts of Georgia": "A half-inch layer of creamy-style peanut butter is troweled onto a graham cracker, then half a banana is crudely diced and pressed firmly into the peanut butter and cemented in place as it were by a second graham cracker."
Two years later, he conceived "A Taxpayer's Prayer":
"O mighty Internal Revenue, who turneth the labor of man to ashes, we thank thee for the multitude of thy forms which thou has set before us and for the infinite confusion of thy commandments which multiplieth the fortunes of lawyer and accountant alike. ..."
[Curious to read some of Russell Baker's books? Try starting with these.]
His targets were legion: the Super Bowl, Miss America, unreadable menus, everything on television, trips with children, the jogging craze, the perils of buying a suit, loneliness and book-of-the-month clubs. He struck poses of despair that resonated with harried readers: of his endless effort to read Proust, of lacking the gene for resisting salesmen, of boredom with dull dirty books.
Stylistically, the "Observer" examined the American scene with plain phrases that echoed Twain as they skewered the pompous. But his voice could be haunting, as in a 1974 column on older poor people in a supermarket: "Staring at 90-cent peanut butter. Taking down an orange, looking for the price, putting it back."
"Old people at the supermarket are being crushed and nobody is even screaming," he wrote.
Mr. Baker occasionally hammered at uncaring government or big business, but frontal attacks were not his stock in trade. "What Baker does," Ronald Steel wrote in Geo magazine in 1983, "is punch holes in vast bubbles of pretension, humanize the abstract and connect the present with what one predecessor, Walter Lippmann, once described as the 'longer past and the larger future."'
A subversive among the sober editorial voices of The Times, Mr. Baker could be tongue-in-cheek one day and melancholy the next, then folksy, anguished, lyrical or acid. He once wrote a Jonathan Swift-like satire on the advantages of public hanging, arguing that a society pleased with capital punishment might do well to cut off thieves' hands and notch the noses of incurable double parkers.
His column ran on three weekdays a week from 1962 to 1972, then switched to a schedule he likened to the "metronomic" rhythms of "Chinese water torture: FridaySundayTuesday, FridaySundayTuesday."
After 1988, the column ran on Tuesdays and Saturdays. He cut back to one a week in July 1997 and retired "Observer" on Dec. 25, 1998.
His last column, "A Few Words at the End," on Christmas, "a day on which nobody reads a newspaper anyhow," spoke of his love affair with newspapers.
"Thanks to newspapers," he wrote, "I have made a four-hour visit to Afghanistan, have seen the Taj Mahal by moonlight, breakfasted at dawn on lamb and couscous while sitting by the marble pool of a Moorish palace in Morocco and once picked up a persistent family of fleas in the Balkans."

Lanky and laconic, Mr. Baker was reminiscent of Jimmy Stewart's reporter in the 1948 movie "Call Northside 777." He had a rumpled, tired look, as if he had pored over old court records all night under a dim bulb and come to the prison, still skeptical, to see the wrongly convicted man. Ms. Ephron saw him as "extremely low-key, terribly nice, often on the verge of being embarrassed, particularly by praise of any sort."
He had kindly blue eyes with droopy lids and an unruly thatch of sandy-gray hair that fell over his forehead like a country boy's. He liked to flop in a chair, put his foot up on a radiator and talk about practically anything. His voice was gravelly but soft, a faded echo of rural Virginia: perfect for the barbed lash or the awful oxymoron.
And he was as devilish in person as in print. A fellow Times columnist, Tom Wicker, recalled that Mr. Baker, talking once to college students, was asked, "What courses should a journalism school teach?"
He replied: "The ideal journalism school needs only one course. Students should be required to stand outside a closed door for six hours. Then the door would open, someone would put his head around the jamb and say, 'No comment.' The door would close again, and the students would be required to write 800 words against a deadline."
The Making of a Newsman
Russell Wayne Baker was born into poverty on Aug. 14, 1925, in Loudoun County, Va., and spent his early years in Morrisonville. "It was primitive," he recalled. "No electricity." When Russell was 5, his father, Benjamin Rex Baker, a stonemason who was often out of work, drank moonshine one night, sank into a diabetic coma and died, leaving his wife and three children destitute.
Russell's strong-willed mother, Lucy Elizabeth Robinson Baker, was forced to give up an infant daughter to childless in-laws and took the boy and his younger sister to live with her brother in Newark. The uncle, a $35-a-week butter salesman, was the family's only wage earner in the Depression, though Mrs. Baker eventually found work as a seamstress and Russell sold magazines door to door.
When Russell was 11, the family moved to Baltimore, where he attended high school. He was popular, a member of the track team and a promising writer, winning a senior essay contest with "The Art of Eating Spaghetti."
He entered Johns Hopkins University on a scholarship in 1942, but left the next year to join the Navy. He took pilot training, but never went abroad during World War II and left the service in 1945.
Returning to Johns Hopkins on the G.I. Bill, Mr. Baker graduated with a bachelor's degree in English in 1947. He wanted to be Ernest Hemingway, but had no real idea what to do. Then a friend who worked part time for The Baltimore Sun told him about a job. It was not much, but he took it: $30 a week as a night police reporter.
For two years, he phoned in robberies, fires and mayhem, and slept late. He helped organize the Newspaper Guild at The Sun and became a tenacious unionist.
In the summer of 1948, he churned out a novel about a reporter in love. He had just broken up with Miriam Emily Nash, a native of Camden, N.J., whom he had met after the war. The novel wound up in the attic, but he married Mimi, as she was called, in 1950. She died in 2015 at 88.
Mr. Baker is survived by three children, Allen, Michael and Kasia, as well as four grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. He is also survived by two sisters, Doris Groh and Mary Leslie Keech.
By 1950, Mr. Baker had become a rewrite man, taking phoned notes from legmen (reporters at the scene) and banging out stories on deadline. He found he was hooked on journalism, and his skills -- speed, accuracy and style -- earned him a plum in 1952 when The Sun sent him to London as a correspondent. He later became The Sun's White House correspondent, and his work in the capital caught the eye of James Reston, the Washington bureau chief of The Times, who hired him in 1954.
His first Times assignment was the State Department. He found it boring. Congress, with its preening V.I.P.s, was better grist. Readers devoured Baker articles peppered with wry observations that captured the feel of Washington. He was soon drawing top assignments: presidential campaigns in 1956 and 1960, trips by Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy, and others that showcased his lucidity.
Taking a New Direction
But he was still restless. Trying to keep out of a rut, he wrote "An American in Washington" (1961), a guide to the capital, detailing the techniques of name-dropping, the importance of lunch and advice on how to talk endlessly without saying anything. Critics and readers were delighted, but ennui sat naggingly on his shoulder.
One day he found himself on a bench outside a closed meeting of a Senate committee, wondering why, at 37, he was "waiting for somebody to come out and lie to me." He was near the end. In 1962, The Sun tried to lure him back with a column, but The Times made a counteroffer, and he accepted.
The column idea was vague. He had in mind casual essays like E. B. White's in The New Yorker, cast in "plain English" with "short sentences," in contrast to what he called The Times's "polysyllabic Latinate English."
Soon the columns began to roll out of his typewriter: on the foibles of politicians, bureaucrats, military contractors. Spoofing a plan to haul nuclear weapons around the country on railroad cars, he proposed a system of mobile Pentagons, complete with little secretaries of defense and presidents who would crisscross the country to confuse the enemy.
During the Pentagon Papers case -- a test of government secrecy versus the public's right to know the truth about the Vietnam War -- Mr. Baker wondered in print how long officials intended to suppress the "Myles Standish papers," saying their disclosure might jeopardize national security.
Many Baker columns were collected in books, including "No Cause for Panic" (1964), "Baker's Dozen" (1964), "All Things Considered" (1965) and "Poor Russell's Almanac" (1972). He wrote a novel, "Our Next President: The Incredible Story of What Happened in the 1968 Elections" (1968), about an election being thrown into the House of Representatives and chaos enveloping America. Some reviewers called it all too real.
After moving to New York in 1974, Mr. Baker took up topics as varied as death and dishwashing, neuroses and the new math. He was often hard-pressed for ideas, but something always seemed to turn up, or down. One day, as the deadline approached, a potato fell past his window. The column the next day was headlined "Potato Mashes Man."
His 1979 Pulitzer -- the first to a humorist for commentary -- was given for 10 columns on tax reform, inflation, the short life of trends, loneliness, fear, Norman Rockwell and other subjects. More collections were published: "So This Is Depravity" (1980) and "The Rescue of Miss Yaskell and Other Pipe Dreams" (1983).
After the success of "Growing Up," Mr. Baker produced a sequel, "The Good Times," in 1989, about his days as a young reporter. Though a best seller only briefly, it was hailed by critics. Writing in The Times, Frank Conroy, whose memoir "Stop-Time" had also found wide acclaim, called "The Good Times" splendid, but complained, "It would certainly make life easier for book reviewers if Russell Baker could manage to write something bad once in a while."
As the host of "Masterpiece Theater," Mr. Baker once did a riff on snooty British clubs, and recalled that Art Buchwald had invited him to join a club he was starting, the American Academy of Humor Columnists.
"What's the purpose?" Mr. Baker asked.
"To keep other people out," his colleague replied.

Full text: Russell Baker, the two-time Pulitzer Prize-winning author whose whimsical, irreverent "Observer" column appeared in The New York Times and hundreds of other newspapers for 36 years and turned a backwoods-born Virginian into one of America's most celebrated writers, died on Monday at his home in Leesburg, Va. He was 93.
The cause was complications from a fall, according to his son Allen Baker.
Mr. Baker, along with the syndicated columnist Art Buchwald (who died in 2007), was one of the best-known newspaper humorists of his time, and The Washington Post ranked his best-selling autobiography, "Growing Up," with the most enduring recollections of American boyhood -- those of James Thurber, H.

The columns, which generated a devoted following, critical acclaim and the 1979 Pulitzer for distinguished commentary, ended with his retirement in 1998.
To a generation of television watchers, he was also a familiar face as the host of "Masterpiece Theater" on PBS from 1993 to 2004, having succeeded Alistair Cooke.
Mr. Baker wrote 15 books, including many collections of his columns, and "Growing Up," a 1982 memoir of his Depression-era youth, his inspirational mother and America between the wars. It earned him his second Pulitzer, the 1983 prize for biography. Besides his two Pulitzer Prizes, he won two George Polk Awards, for commentary in 1978 and career achievement in 1998, and many other honors.
After his retirement from The Times, Mr. Baker wrote for The New York Review of Books on politics, history, journalism and other subjects. A collection of 11 of those essays, on revered public figures, was published in 2002 under the title "Looking Back."
Earlier, he wrote for Life, Look, Reader's Digest, The Saturday Evening Post, Ladies' Home Journal and other publications. From 1985 through 1994, he served on the Columbia University Pulitzer Prize board, selecting winners of the nation's most prestigious awards in journalism, literature and the arts. He was its chairman in 1993 and 1994.
'Ballet in a Telephone Booth'
But it was as a columnist that Mr. Baker made his name. Based at first in Washington, he recalled that he had to feel his way in the new genre of spoof and jape. "Nobody knew what the column was going to be," he told the writer Nora Ephron. "I didn't. The Times didn't."
But soon he was doing what he called his "ballet in a telephone booth," creating in the confined space of 750 words satirical dialogues, parodies and burlesques of politicians and the whirling capital circus -- then stoking the fires of the antiwar and civil rights struggles of the 1960s and the Watergate scandal that forced President Richard M. Nixon from office in 1974.
That year, Mr. Baker moved from Washington to New York, and his column changed. His topics grew more varied, less tied to news events and more to the trappings of ordinary life. His writing, admirers said, matured into literature: an owlish wit, sometimes surreal, often absurdist, usually scouring dark corridors of paradox, always carried off with a subtext of good sense.
He wrote of Francisco Franco's dying and going straight to the New York Department of Motor Vehicles. In another column, a pseudonymous Sykes tells of awakening one day to find that he has someone else's feet. Sykes conceals the shame from his wife and colleagues. Doctors are no help. Finally he confides to an editor, who signs him to a three-book contract. The feet become television celebrities. Hollywood wants Sykes's life story for a Robert Redford movie.
In 1975, after The Times's food editor and restaurant critic Craig Claiborne reported in gastronomic detail on a $4,000 31-course epicurean repast for two, with wines, in Paris, Mr. Baker wrote "Francs and Beans," describing his own culinary triumph after coming home to find a note in the kitchen saying his wife had gone out.
"The meal opened with a 1975 Diet Pepsi served in a disposable bottle," he wrote. "Although its bouquet was negligible, its distinct metallic aftertaste evoked memories of tin cans one had licked experimentally in the first flush of childhood's curiosity." And on to a "pâté de fruites de nuts of Georgia": "A half-inch layer of creamy-style peanut butter is troweled onto a graham cracker, then half a banana is crudely diced and pressed firmly into the peanut butter and cemented in place as it were by a second graham cracker."
Two years later, he conceived "A Taxpayer's Prayer":
"O mighty Internal Revenue, who turneth the labor of man to ashes, we thank thee for the multitude of thy forms which thou has set before us and for the infinite confusion of thy commandments which multiplieth the fortunes of lawyer and accountant alike. ..."
His targets were legion: the Super Bowl, Miss America, unreadable menus, everything on television, trips with children, the jogging craze, the perils of buying a suit, loneliness and book-of-the-month clubs. He struck poses of despair that resonated with harried readers: of his endless effort to read Proust, of lacking the gene for resisting salesmen, of boredom with dull dirty books.
Stylistically, the "Observer" examined the American scene with plain phrases that echoed Twain as they skewered the pompous. But his voice could be haunting, as in a 1974 column on older poor people in a supermarket: "Staring at 90-cent peanut butter. Taking down an orange, looking for the price, putting it back."
"Old people at the supermarket are being crushed and nobody is even screaming," he wrote.
Mr. Baker occasionally hammered at uncaring government or big business, but frontal attacks were not his stock in trade. "What Baker does," Ronald Steel wrote in Geo magazine in 1983, "is punch holes in vast bubbles of pretension, humanize the abstract and connect the present with what one predecessor, Walter Lippmann, once described as the 'longer past and the larger future."'
A subversive among the sober editorial voices of The Times, Mr. Baker could be tongue-in-cheek one day and melancholy the next, then folksy, anguished, lyrical or acid. He once wrote a Jonathan Swift-like satire on the advantages of public hanging, arguing that a society pleased with capital punishment might do well to cut off thieves' hands and notch the noses of incurable double parkers.
His column ran on three weekdays a week from 1962 to 1972, then switched to a schedule he likened to the "metronomic" rhythms of "Chinese water torture: FridaySundayTuesday, FridaySundayTuesday."
After 1988, the column ran on Tuesdays and Saturdays. He cut back to one a week in July 1997 and retired "Observer" on Dec. 25, 1998.
His last column, "A Few Words at the End," on Christmas, "a day on which nobody reads a newspaper anyhow," spoke of his love affair with newspapers.
"Thanks to newspapers," he wrote, "I have made a four-hour visit to Afghanistan, have seen the Taj Mahal by moonlight, breakfasted at dawn on lamb and couscous while sitting by the marble pool of a Moorish palace in Morocco and once picked up a persistent family of fleas in the Balkans."

Lanky and laconic, Mr. Baker was reminiscent of Jimmy Stewart's reporter in the 1948 movie "Call Northside 777." He had a rumpled, tired look, as if he had pored over old court records all night under a dim bulb and come to the prison, still skeptical, to see the wrongly convicted man. Ms. Ephron saw him as "extremely low-key, terribly nice, often on the verge of being embarrassed, particularly by praise of any sort."
He had kindly blue eyes with droopy lids and an unruly thatch of sandy-gray hair that fell over his forehead like a country boy's. He liked to flop in a chair, put his foot up on a radiator and talk about practically anything. His voice was gravelly but soft, a faded echo of rural Virginia: perfect for the barbed lash or the awful oxymoron.
And he was as devilish in person as in print. A fellow Times columnist, Tom Wicker, recalled that Mr. Baker, talking once to college students, was asked, "What courses should a journalism school teach?"
He replied: "The ideal journalism school needs only one course. Students should be required to stand outside a closed door for six hours. Then the door would open, someone would put his head around the jamb and say, 'No comment.' The door would close again, and the students would be required to write 800 words against a deadline."
The Making of a Newsman
Russell Wayne Baker was born into poverty on Aug. 14, 1925, in Loudoun County, Va., and spent his early years in Morrisonville. "It was primitive," he recalled. "No electricity." When Russell was 5, his father, Benjamin Rex Baker, a stonemason who was often out of work, drank moonshine one night, sank into a diabetic coma and died, leaving his wife and three children destitute.
Russell's strong-willed mother, Lucy Elizabeth Robinson Baker, was forced to give up an infant daughter to childless in-laws and took the boy and his younger sister to live with her brother in Newark. The uncle, a $35-a-week butter salesman, was the family's only wage earner in the Depression, though Mrs. Baker eventually found work as a seamstress and Russell sold magazines door to door.
When Russell was 11, the family moved to Baltimore, where he attended high school. He was popular, a member of the track team and a promising writer, winning a senior essay contest with "The Art of Eating Spaghetti."
He entered Johns Hopkins University on a scholarship in 1942, but left the next year to join the Navy. He took pilot training, but never went abroad during World War II and left the service in 1945.
Returning to Johns Hopkins on the G.I. Bill, Mr. Baker graduated with a bachelor's degree in English in 1947. He wanted to be Ernest Hemingway, but had no real idea what to do. Then a friend who worked part time for The Baltimore Sun told him about a job. It was not much, but he took it: $30 a week as a night police reporter.
For two years, he phoned in robberies, fires and mayhem, and slept late. He helped organize the Newspaper Guild at The Sun and became a tenacious unionist.
In the summer of 1948, he churned out a novel about a reporter in love. He had just broken up with Miriam Emily Nash, a native of Camden, N.J., whom he had met after the war. The novel wound up in the attic, but he married Mimi, as she was called, in 1950. She died in 2015 at 88.
Mr. Baker is survived by three children, Allen, Michael and Kasia, as well as four grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. He is also survived by two sisters, Doris Groh and Mary Leslie Keech.
By 1950, Mr. Baker had become a rewrite man, taking phoned notes from legmen (reporters at the scene) and banging out stories on deadline. He found he was hooked on journalism, and his skills -- speed, accuracy and style -- earned him a plum in 1952 when The Sun sent him to London as a correspondent. He later became The Sun's White House correspondent, and his work in the capital caught the eye of James Reston, the Washington bureau chief of The Times, who hired him in 1954.
His first Times assignment was the State Department. He found it boring. Congress, with its preening V.I.P.s, was better grist. Readers devoured Baker articles peppered with wry observations that captured the feel of Washington. He was soon drawing top assignments: presidential campaigns in 1956 and 1960, trips by Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy, and others that showcased his lucidity.
Taking a New Direction
But he was still restless. Trying to keep out of a rut, he wrote "An American in Washington" (1961), a guide to the capital, detailing the techniques of name-dropping, the importance of lunch and advice on how to talk endlessly without saying anything. Critics and readers were delighted, but ennui sat naggingly on his shoulder.
One day he found himself on a bench outside a closed meeting of a Senate committee, wondering why, at 37, he was "waiting for somebody to come out and lie to me." He was near the end. In 1962, The Sun tried to lure him back with a column, but The Times made a counteroffer, and he accepted.
The column idea was vague. He had in mind casual essays like E. B. White's in The New Yorker, cast in "plain English" with "short sentences," in contrast to what he called The Times's "polysyllabic Latinate English."
Soon the columns began to roll out of his typewriter: on the foibles of politicians, bureaucrats, military contractors. Spoofing a plan to haul nuclear weapons around the country on railroad cars, he proposed a system of mobile Pentagons, complete with little secretaries of defense and presidents who would crisscross the country to confuse the enemy.
During the Pentagon Papers case -- a test of government secrecy versus the public's right to know the truth about the Vietnam War -- Mr. Baker wondered in print how long officials intended to suppress the "Miles Standish papers," saying their disclosure might jeopardize national security.
Many Baker columns were collected in books, including "No Cause for Panic" (1964), "Baker's Dozen" (1964), "All Things Considered" (1965) and "Poor Russell's Almanac" (1972). He wrote a novel, "Our Next President: The Incredible Story of What Happened in the 1968 Elections" (1968), about an election being thrown into the House of Representatives and chaos enveloping America. Some reviewers called it all too real.
After moving to New York in 1974, Mr. Baker took up topics as varied as death and dishwashing, neuroses and the new math. He was often hard-pressed for ideas, but something always seemed to turn up, or down. One day, as the deadline approached, a potato fell past his window. The column the next day was headlined "Potato Mashes Man."
His 1979 Pulitzer -- the first to a humorist for commentary -- was given for 10 columns on tax reform, inflation, the short life of trends, loneliness, fear, Norman Rockwell and other subjects. More collections were published: "So This Is Depravity" (1980) and "The Rescue of Miss Yaskell and Other Pipe Dreams" (1983).
After the success of "Growing Up," Mr. Baker produced a sequel, "The Good Times," in 1989, about his days as a young reporter. Though a best seller only briefly, it was hailed by critics. Writing in The Times, Frank Conroy, whose memoir "Stop-Time" had also found wide acclaim, called "The Good Times" splendid, but complained, "It would certainly make life easier for book reviewers if Russell Baker could manage to write something bad once in a while."
As the host of "Masterpiece Theater," Mr. Baker once did a riff on snooty British clubs, and recalled that Art Buchwald had invited him to join a club he was starting, the American Academy of Humor Columnists.
"What's the purpose?" Mr. Baker asked.
"To keep other people out," his colleague replied.

Full text: Although there have been approximately 100,000 media profiles of enthusiastic blue-collar Trump supporters in diners, the reality is that Donald Trump is extraordinarily unpopular. A recent Pew analysis found only one other modern president with such a low approval rating two years into his administration.
On the other hand, that president was Ronald Reagan, who went on to win re-election in a landslide. So some Trump boosters are suggesting their champion can repeat that performance. Can he?
No, he can't. And it's worth understanding why, both to assess current political prospects and to debunk the Reagan mythology still infesting U.S. conservatism.
Let's talk first about the Reagan story.
Reagan was indeed unpopular in January 1983, mainly because of the economic situation. Despite a huge tax cut in 1981 and a sharp rise in military spending, more than 10 percent of the labor force was unemployed.
Although many voters blamed Reagan for this economic distress, the truth was that it had little to do with his policies; it was, instead, the consequence of the Federal Reserve's attempts to bring down inflation, which had driven interest rates as high as 19 percent.
By mid-1982, however, the Fed had reversed course, sharply reducing rates. And these rate cuts eventually produced a huge housing boom, which in turn drove a rapid economic recovery.
Like the earlier slump, this boom had little to do with Reagan's policies, but voters gave him credit anyway. Unemployment was still fairly high -- more than 7 percent -- in November 1984, but what matters for elections is whether things are getting better or worse, not how good they are in absolute terms. And in 1983-84, unemployment fell fast, so Reagan won big.
How does this story compare with Trump's prospects now?
First of all, where Reagan was unpopular because of a weak economy, Trump is unpopular despite a strong economy. That is, he starts from a much lower baseline.
And there is no chance of a "morning in America"-type boom over the next two years.
For one thing, in 1983-84 America was able to grow very fast by taking up the huge amount of economic slack that had accumulated over the course of the double-dip recession from 1979 to 1982. Right now, with unemployment below 4 percent, it's not clear whether there's any economic slack at all. There's certainly not enough to allow the 7-plus percent growth rates in real personal income that prevailed in the run-up to the 1984 election.
Also, a housing boom driven by dramatic interest rate reductions was central to the rapid growth of Reagan's third and fourth year in office. (No, it wasn't all about the miraculous effects of tax cuts.)
But today's Fed can't -- literally can't -- deliver the kind of boost it did back then by bringing double-digit interest rates down to single-digit levels, because rates are already quite low. And with housing prices looking rather high, it's hard to imagine a huge surge looking forward.
Are there other ways that the economy might rescue Trump? What about the 2017 tax cut, which Trump said would be "rocket fuel" for the economy?
Well, by increasing the budget deficit, that cut probably gave the economy some stimulus, temporarily raising growth. But that effect is already fading out, and the economy would have been slowing down even without the extra drag created by the Trump shutdown. This doesn't necessarily mean that we'll have a recession soon, but we're almost surely looking at unimpressive growth at best.
But wasn't the tax cut supposed to increase long-run growth, by increasing business investment? Yes, it was -- but it isn't delivering on that promise. Corporations received huge tax breaks, but they mostly used the money to pay higher dividends and buy back stocks, not for investment. And even the modest rise in business investment that did take place in 2018 seems to have been driven by higher oil prices, not tax cuts.
So Donald Trump is no Ronald Reagan.
Actually, even Ronald Reagan was no Ronald Reagan. Although right-wing legend portrays his experience as proof of the magical power of tax cuts, the economy actually performed somewhat better under Bill Clinton, who raised taxes. (Although, to be fair, almost all Republicans seem to have managed to expunge that fact from their memories.)
Most of Reagan's political success reflected not fundamental economic achievement but good luck with the timing of the business cycle. And Trump almost certainly won't experience comparable luck.
Combine this lack of a strong economic upside over the next two years with Trump's extreme current unpopularity, and his chances for re-election -- if he even makes it to the end of his first term -- don't look too good. Which raises the question of what he and his party will do if defeat is staring them in the face.
I don't know the answer to that question, and if you aren't scared about how a cornered Trump might lash out, you haven't been paying attention.
What's clear, however, is that Trump and his allies are in a deep hole right now -- and the economy isn't going to dig them out of it.

In Venezuela, Soldiers Accused Of Turning on Maduro Are Held

Full text: CARACAS, Venezuela -- Members of the Venezuelan National Guard were detained in the capital early Monday, the military said, after online videos showed a group of soldiers pledging allegiance to an opposition leader seeking to oust President Nicolás Maduro.

The soldiers' apparent defiance at a military installation in the western Caracas neighborhood of Cotiza occurred days after opposition leaders offered amnesty to members of the armed forces who turned their backs on the government and helped establish a transitional government that would convene fair elections.
The opposition leaders have called for nationwide demonstrations on Wednesday, which they hope will show that their bid to replace Mr. Maduro has widespread support.
The United States and several governments in the region have backed the opposition's plan, but leaders of the movement acknowledge that getting the armed forces to flip will be the toughest hurdle.
"We need to appeal to their conscience and create incentives for them," said Juan Andrés Mejía, an opposition lawmaker.
But creating incentives may not be enough if members of the military fear that any sign of disloyalty may carry face harsh consequences. On Monday, 27 people were detained after security forces surrounded the military installation, according to Diosdado Cabello, president of the Constituent Assembly, a legislative body packed with Maduro loyalists.
The service members who had participated in the uprising had been "neutralized, defeated and captured in record time," Mr. Cabello said. He added in a series of messages posted on Twitter that the men were "confessing details" and that they had turned on the government after being offered "villas and castles."
Venezuela's military said the rebellious soldiers had stockpiled weapons. "These subjects will face the full weight of the law," it said in a statement.
Neighbors reported hearing clashes at the military installation as nearby residents banged pots and pans, apparently in a show of support for the mutinous troops.
Diplomats and security analysts in Venezuela said they found the soldiers' actions on Monday morning puzzling. Some said the government may have staged a small act of defiance to justify taking extreme security measures ahead of Wednesday's protests -- and perhaps as a warning to any military groups that may be mulling switching sides.
Their skepticism was based on the hapless plan that the soldiers supposedly set in motion and the speed with which the government issued a detailed statement claiming that the plot had been quickly quashed.
Whatever the case, the events added to the tension palpable in the capital before the planned protests.
"What happened this morning is very dangerous for the opposition," said Rocío San Miguel, a security analyst with deep knowledge of the country's armed forces. "The government will use it to its favor."
Ms. San Miguel said rank-and-file soldiers had been defecting from their bases in large numbers in recent weeks. Their salaries have become increasingly worthless amid soaring inflation.
Juan Guaidó, the recently installed president of the National Assembly who is leading the effort to establish a transitional government, called the soldiers' actions "a show of the generalized feeling" in the armed forces after Mr. Maduro was sworn in for a second term, on Jan. 10.
His re-election in May was widely condemned as rigged, and the United States and several Latin American governments have said they do not consider him a legitimately elected leader.
"Our troops know that the chain of command is broken due to the usurpation of the presidency," Mr. Guaidó wrote on Twitter on Monday. "We don't want the security forces to split apart or clash, we want them to stand united on the side of the people, the Constitution and against the usurpation."
The country's Supreme Court, which is packed with Maduro loyalists, issued a ruling late Monday morning that called the current leaders of the National Assembly illegitimate.
The court warned that recent laws passed by the assembly, including one granting amnesty to members of the security forces who turn on the government, are unconstitutional.
The ruling appeared unlikely to have any practical effect. The court and members of the National Assembly have not recognized the legitimacy of each other's actions since the court sought to assume the powers of the lawmaking body in March 2017.
Mr. Maduro first came to power in a snap vote after the death in 2013 of President Hugo Chávez, who anointed him as his successor. Over the years, Mr. Maduro has tightened his grip on power, and unrest within the armed forces has grown. Dozens of Venezuelan military officers have been detained in recent months on suspicion of plotting coups.
As residents in the area of the uprising awoke to the sound of clashes, many took to the streets to support the rebelling troops, according to videos posted online. Seeking to keep protests from growing, security officers fired tear gas, according to residents.
The beginning of Mr. Maduro's new term drew an international outcry that has left the Venezuelan government more isolated than ever before. It also invigorated the opposition, which had appeared rudderless and largely ineffectual since a wave of protests in 2017 was crushed by the security forces.
Opposition leaders have convened town-hall-style meetings across Venezuela to build support for their vision of a transitional government. Those meetings have been attended by thousands of people. Some have been held in poor districts that have traditionally been bedrocks of support for Mr. Maduro's party.

Full text: BEIJING -- In the vast metropolis of Chongqing in western China, three huge Ford Motor assembly plants have slowed to a fraction of their earlier pace.
In the eastern province of Jiangsu, hundreds of chemical factories have closed.
In Guangdong Province in the southeast, factories have idled workers in droves.
China's huge economy, a major driver of global growth, is cooling just when the world needs its spark. On Monday, Chinese officials said that, during the last three months of 2018, the economy grew at its slowest pace since the global financial crisis.
It is happening at a difficult time. The broader world outlook is beginning to dim. The American economy, which has powered ahead in recent years with strong growth and low unemployment, is showing some signs of a slowdown and is facing higher short-term interest rates that could act as a brake. Europe's resurgence is beginning to show its age, too, with even Germany's industrial engine starting to sputter.
In the past, China has helped the world out of such weak spots, most notably during the global financial crisis. But this time, its economy is showing pronounced weakness.
Car sales have plunged in China since last summer. Smartphone sales are falling. The real estate market has stagnated, with deeply indebted developers forced to pay steep interest rates to roll over their debts. And trade frictions with the West, coupled with tough policies from Beijing toward foreign investors, have made Chinese and foreign companies alike warier of further investment in China.
"European investment in China is going down," Cecilia Malmström, the European Union's commissioner of trade, said during an interview in Washington. "That is more because it is becoming increasingly complicated to do business there, with the forced technology transfer, with the lack of transparency, discrimination as compared to Chinese companies, with the massive subsidies of state-owned companies."
For the heads of state and corporate leaders gathering this week in Davos, Switzerland, for the World Economic Forum, the Chinese economy could be the most pressing issue, even among the trade fights and political uncertainty plaguing the rest of the world.
China on Monday said its economy grew 6.4 percent during the last three months of 2018 compared with the same time in 2017. For all of 2018, China's economy grew 6.6 percent, the slowest pace since 1990, though many economists believe the country's headline figures are unreliable.
Previous slowdowns in China, like the one in 2015 and 2016, unnerved investors and global business leaders alike, setting off worries that multinational companies would lose profits from their Chinese subsidiaries, or that Chinese companies would dump their surplus production on world markets at very low prices.
Apple surprised markets this month when it warned of weaker-than-expected demand for its iPhones in China. Ford Motor cut output at its Chongqing joint venture by 70 percent in November, in what Ford says was a move to reduce inventories of unsold cars. Chemical industry experts said that mostly Chinese-owned chemical factories in Jiangsu had been shutting down because of weak demand and stricter environmental enforcement.
The question now is to what extent nervous business leaders elsewhere will postpone investment as China slows, and how many investors will dump their shareholdings.
"The global economy and financial markets are incredibly sensitive to China's growth and currency outlook," said Robin Brooks, the chief economist at the Washington-based Institute of International Finance. "The immediate financial linkages are relatively modest, but they are swamped by sentiment channels."
To be sure, further slowing in China is not the only risk the global economy faces. A disorderly British exit from the European Union or a financial crisis in debt-ridden Italy could also be unsettling. In the United States, the national debt is rising and the stimulus from large tax cuts may start to wear off by next year. The Federal Reserve could keep raising interest rates to keep inflation at bay, making it more expensive to borrow money, though it isn't clear exactly what the American central bank will do.
Still, the big question now is, to paraphrase the line about Las Vegas: Will what happens in China stay in China, or will it become a global problem?
The World Bank aptly titled its review of this year's outlook "Darkening Prospects." It warned that China's slowdown could affect countries that export a great deal to it.
China is the world's second-largest importer, after the United States. But the composition of its imports is unusual.
It is the largest market for a long list of commodity exporters, from Australia to Uruguay, thanks to its voracious appetite for iron ore, food, energy and other raw materials it needs to keep its economy humming. China is also a large market for factory equipment made in countries like Germany and Japan.
But its imports of manufactured goods overall are few for an economy of its size. That has limited the dependence of workers elsewhere, particularly in the United States, on the Chinese economy.
The global impact of the Chinese slowdown now underway could be limited if Beijing decides to borrow and spend its way into more growth. Already this month, China has issued a series of announcements approving six municipal subway construction projects and three new intercity rail lines, at a combined cost of $148 billion.
"The weaker the data gets, the more confident we get that they'll tip a lot of stimulus into keeping the economy moving," said Michael Blythe, the chief economist at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia in Sydney.
Many of the biggest new construction projects are in China's western regions, said Wang Min, the chairman of Xuzhou Construction Machinery Group, a state-owned giant. The projects have been good for his company, China's largest producer of huge earth-moving equipment, and its orders have soared in recent months.
But linking together towns in sparsely populated areas of mountains and deserts is expensive. It adds large sums to China's already very high levels of debt. And the investment may produce scant new economic activity to pay off that extra debt.
Previously accumulated debt lies at the heart of a one-two punch that has laid China's overall economy low in recent months.
Vice Premier Liu He promised at Davos a year ago that China would rein in the growth of credit within three years. Chinese officials were confident at the time that they could head off a trade war with the United States.
They set about putting stringent limits on the country's extensive shadow banking networks. Those networks had been providing a gusher of loans to the country's small and midsize enterprises, which China's big, state-owned banks have long neglected in favor of lending to state-owned enterprises.
But by the end of April, as the economy started slowing, Chinese officials started to say that three years was not enough time. As credit dried up and many private sector businesses started running low on cash, top regulators expressed worry at a Shanghai financial conference in June that they might have already gone too far.
At the same time, momentum was building in Beijing to extend the influence of the Communist Party and state-owned enterprises, mainly at the expense of the private sector. The private sector is responsible for most job creation in China, and the rhetoric from Beijing further scared investors.
Less than a month after the Shanghai conference, the trade war began in earnest. President Trump imposed the first of three tranches of tariffs on imports from China. Corporate executives say that by the time the third tranche hit in late September, consumer confidence was crumbling. Purchases of big-ticket goods, especially cars, fell fast.
Business confidence slumped as well. A survey of 270 importers in the United States conducted in late December and early January by Panjiva, a trade data service, found that 71 percent planned to change how and where they bought their goods if tariffs stayed unchanged. And 87 percent said they would do so if the Trump administration raised tariffs further.
As companies start moving their supply chains, the main beneficiaries seem to be Southeast Asian nations like Vietnam and Indonesia. But to the extent that those countries buy more factory equipment from places like Germany, some of the negative effects overseas from weaker sales in China could be offset.
Most economists are predicting that the first quarter of this year will be weak in China. Many are predicting that the second will be, too.
But quite a few say they still have confidence in China's consistent, four-decade track record of pulling itself out of slumps quickly. Chinese officials have put new emphasis in recent weeks on rebuilding confidence. And they are at least trying to reassure private companies that the government will not favor state-owned enterprises over them.
"As long as we can create a level playing field," said Ma Jiantang, a senior economic adviser to China's cabinet, "private companies will surely succeed."

Stocks' U-Turn All but Erases Losses of 2018

Full text: Stocks have staged a remarkable turnaround in the early days of 2019, rebounding after an end-of-the-year tailspin that was fomented by fears of recession in the United States.
Three straight weeks of gains in the new year on Wall Street have erased nearly all of 2018's losses. It's the best start to a year since 1987.
Even so, many factors behind last year's troubling decline remain unresolved. American companies and consumers are less optimistic about the future, and large economies like Germany and China are signaling a global slowdown driven by the trade war. Britain is in turmoil over leaving the European Union. And a new concern, the longest federal government shutdown in history, also poses a risk to the domestic economy.
A month ago, any one of those elements might have fueled a steep decline in stocks. In December, waves of panic-driven selling left the S&P 500 dangling almost 20 percent below its high. Now, it's all being taken in stride.
The difference is an abrupt change in tone from the Federal Reserve. This year began with repeated public assurances from Fed officials that they were sensitive to concerns about the economy and would be patient and flexible as they decided whether to raise interest rates.
Investors were alarmed last year by the idea that the central bank was determined to keep raising rates, risking a recession. It wasn't just Wall Street that worried. As stocks were sliding in December, President Trump, who boasted about stocks as they rose earlier in the year, became fixated on the Fed and its chairman, Jerome H. Powell. "The only problem our economy has is the Fed," he wrote on Twitter on Dec. 24.
"They're trying their best to be a source of stability in markets," said Samantha Azzarello, global market strategist at J. P. Morgan Asset Management. "What happened last year really shook people and their confidence in investing in equities."
The Fed has always held sway over the financial markets, but that influence tends to grow in the later stages of an expansion, when every interest rate increase is seen as the one that might trip up the economy.
The United States economy is still strong: The unemployment rate is near 50-year lows, wages are starting to rise and growth in corporate profits remains robust. To the Fed, these are reasons to keep raising borrowing costs and stave off potential inflation. It did so four times in 2018.
But after 10 years of economic growth, many investors are worried that a turning point is near, and that higher interest rates might bring on a slowdown faster than they expect. And the recent stock market gains may not stick without proof that corporate profits can keep growing.
"We're in a bit of a 'show me' moment for skeptical and uncertain investors," said Kate Moore, chief equity strategist for BlackRock, the world's largest investment firm. "It's going to have to be backed up with earnings and the confidence that those earnings are going to be sustainable."
This past week, American companies began disclosing their sales and profits for the fourth quarter. With about 10 percent of companies in the S&P 500 posting results, the reports have been strong.
After the S&P 500 rose 2.9 percent in the week through Friday, it is up 13.6 percent from its Dec. 24 low. The stock index ended trading on Friday just below its 2018 starting point.
However, earnings reports reflect only what happened in the past. When it comes to how they will do in 2019, some large businesses have cautioned that they don't have a clear view.
Ford recently warned that the trade war and Britain's impending exit from the European Union made it impossible to offer investors a forecast. The homebuilder Lennar did the same, blaming weakness and uncertainty in the housing market.
Broad surveys of sentiment also suggest reason for worry. On Friday, the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index fell to the lowest point of the Trump presidency and well below forecasters' expectations. Earlier in the week, a report from the Fed showed that, through early January, executives and economists had become less optimistic for a host of reasons, including trade and political uncertainty and swings in the financial markets.
The data in that report came before the government shutdown had stretched to nearly a month. Now the longest in United States history, the closing will start to take a toll. The latest estimates from the White House's own Council of Economic Advisers suggest that the shutdown has already knocked almost half a percentage point off the economy's growth rate, though that drag should end once the government reopens.
The shutdown is affecting some large businesses already. On Tuesday, Delta Air Lines cautioned that reduced travel by government officials and contractors would hurt its sales growth, at a rate of about $25 million a month. JPMorgan Chase executives noted that if the Securities and Exchange Commission -- currently closed except for emergency matters -- was not able to give approvals for stock market share offerings, and mergers went unapproved by other government agencies, it could cut fee revenue for its investment banking operations.
Profits at American companies may be hurt by the United States' trade war with China. Evidence that it is slowing global growth mounted this past week, with Germany reporting its slowest annual growth rate since 2013 and China saying that exports fell last month.
Companies in the S&P 500 generate 37 percent of their sales, on average, from markets outside the United States, according to the data provider FactSet, and businesses that have increased their exposure to global economies now look vulnerable.
But for the most part, stock investors have shrugged off these concerns in January, now that they see the Fed as less eager to raise rates.
The Fed had spooked investors as recently as Dec. 19, when it raised interest rates, and its chairman, Mr. Powell, said he didn't see a need for the central bank to change the way it has been slowly selling off the bonds it bought to bolster the economy over the last decade. The stock market slid 6 percent in the days afterward.
"Clearly the market was skittish about, primarily, the Fed," said Alicia Levine, chief strategist at BNY Mellon Investment Management. "It sounded like the Fed was on autopilot."
By Jan. 4, Mr. Powell's comments had a different tone. Speaking at a public panel discussion, he made a point of emphasizing the Fed's ability to be patient with further interest rate increases, given that inflation remains low.
"We're listening with, you know, sensitively to the message that -- that markets are sending," Mr. Powell said. "And we're going to be taking those downside risks into account as we make policy going forward."
Within days, other central bank officials repeated the sentiment, and the Fed published the details of its December meeting, which showed that many of its policymakers had already reached that conclusion. Stocks had already bounced off their Christmas Eve low when Mr. Powell spoke, but have gained 9.1 percent since.
"Their commentary has really done a 180 in a really short period of time," said David Giroux, chief investment officer of United States equity at asset manager T. Rowe Price.
Over the last 30 years, investors have grown accustomed to looking to the Fed for help when the market found itself in a sticky spot. Some trace the phenomenon to the October 1987 market crash. The morning after stocks tumbled roughly 20 percent in a single day, the Fed, under the recently appointed Alan Greenspan, issued a statement indicating that it was ready to support the economic and financial system.
Stocks rebounded sharply, helping to embed an expectation into the markets that continues today. And, in the past decade, as stocks have climbed in their longest run of gains ever, the Fed's decisions to back away from plans to raise interest rates or withdraw economic stimulus have helped keep the bull market alive.
Mr. Powell and the Fed seem to have done that again.
"I think his comments on Jan. 4 were critical to getting excitement and willingness to invest back into the market," Ms. Levine said.

In Small Towns, Shutdown Has Ripple Effects

Full text: Verla Bloomfield has the kind of workplace that seems plucked from a different era. She has a pension, a union, several weeks of vacation and a paycheck that has nearly doubled in 14 years. Her employer? The United States government.
"People used to work for companies their whole life and retire and take their pension and move on," said Ms. Bloomfield, who handles claims for the Social Security Administration in Tulsa, Okla. "That's not the reality of our work force anymore, but it still is for the federal government."
By many measures, the last couple of decades scorched American workers. Wages crawled up, factory jobs fled to China and benefits collapsed. But those years look less painful if you worked for Uncle Sam.
Since 2000, average pay has grown twice as fast for federal employees as it has in the private sector. That's partly because the federal work force has become more educated and specialized. It is also built into the job. Even without the salaries that top performers can command in the corporate world, government workers who do well are entitled by law to regular pay increases, an increasingly rare guarantee elsewhere.
"It has been a really key route to the middle class," said Heidi Shierholz, an economist with the Economic Policy Institute in Washington. "These are jobs in a highly unionized sector, where people see decent benefits, decent job security, decent wage growth over time."
While raises have slowed in recent years, these jobs are still often the best around. Eight in 10 are outside of the Beltway. And the paychecks -- which have stopped arriving during the longest United States government shutdown ever -- are increasingly critical to local economies.
That is especially true in places that are remote and have high jobless rates, like Pocahontas County, W.Va. "Natural resources abound, but job opportunities don't," said Cynthia Sandeno, a district ranger with the United States Forest Service, who oversees hundreds of thousands of acres of woodlands in the area.
Ms. Sandeno, 44, manages 25 wildlife ecologists, biologists, engineers and foresters who make anywhere from $28,000 to $100,000 a year, which puts many of them at the top of the local pay scale. Their missing checks will very likely be felt far beyond their own bank accounts.
Ms. Sandeno says that since they were furloughed, her staff members stopped eating out at the Dirtbean cafe or Rayetta's Lunch Box in Marlinton, a town of 1,000. "They are just normal people who don't want to file for unemployment," she says. There aren't a lot of alternatives in the area.
"It's 45 miles to the closest McDonald's," she said. The shutdown also derailed Ms. Sandeno's plan to make two job offers to local residents and promote one of her employees.
"Those are three families that would be getting above-average pay," she said.
As globalization has shuttered factories and decimated entire industries, federal employment has been a bastion of stability. It has not grown, and occupies a shrinking share of the overall labor market, but it remains an equalizer for African-Americans and women, who are far more likely to earn high salaries working for the government than they would with a company.
The work force includes most of the occupations found in the private sector -- as varied as janitors and accountants -- with salaries that span the lowest and highest ends of the economy. The ranks include Veterans Health Administration pharmacy technicians in Mississippi earning $43,000 a year, and lawyers for the Securities and Exchange Commission in Washington pulling down $200,000.
Federal employees on average earn higher salaries than private sector workers, partly because they are far more likely to have advanced degrees, and they're older. The government has also outsourced many low-paying positions -- landscapers and security guards, for example -- to contractors, who number in the millions.
Unions representing the workers point out that Congress has not lifted federal employees' pay enough to keep up with inflation in recent years.
If you got an entry-level job today processing tax returns at the Internal Revenue Service in Ogden, Utah, for example, you would earn $29,847 in salary. That's less than you would have made in 2011, after inflation. The decline is partly because of a three-year federal salary freeze under President Barack Obama starting in 2011, followed by 1 percent raises for four years.
"People are worse off than they were at the beginning of the decade," said Jacqueline Simon, the policy director of the American Federation of Government Employees, a union representing 700,000 workers.
But the reality is that people who have held onto their government jobs for many years have not languished in the same role at the same pay grade. They have progressed up the ladder and benefited from regular raises at least every few years. They all have pensions and almost all have health insurance, perks that are harder to come by as an employee in corporate America.
When Ms. Bloomfield, 55, started at the Social Security office in Tulsa in 2005, she made $40,000. Then, over the next decade or so, she climbed four levels in the ranks of the federal work force. "Those were big pay jumps," she said. In 2017, Ms. Bloomfield got a promotion that put her salary at $78,000 a year, a comfortable sum in Tulsa.
Unions and conservative groups often argue whether people like Ms. Bloomfield are overpaid or undercompensated. Many of those at the high end of the scale could command even bigger salaries on Wall Street or in Silicon Valley -- and estimates that break down pay by occupation have shown that the government pays less than companies do for similar work.
Ms. Bloomfield would take stability over a six-figure salary in the private sector any day. Her brother earns much more than she does in technical support in Austin, Tex. But he's had to switch employers multiple times in the last 20 years because of corporate restructuring and layoffs.
"Even though he makes a high wage, he has to live with this uncertainty," she said. "We don't have that stress."
Steve Fosse, a revenue agent with the I.R.S., isn't sure whether that trade-off is worth it anymore. The first person in his family to graduate from college, Mr. Fosse, 39, took a job with the government because it offered reliability. "I wanted the benefits and the guaranteed paychecks," he said.
For the most part, that dream panned out. Mr. Fosse earns $90,000 a year, a comfortable sum that helped him buy a four-bedroom home in West Fargo, N.D. He doesn't exactly indulge in luxuries -- his newest car is a used Toyota Sienna that has logged 170,000 miles -- but he hasn't lost much sleep over where his next few paychecks will come from. Until now.
Mr. Fosse is furloughed and has begun selling everything he can -- an old television, a stationary bicycle, a snow blower -- on Craigslist. He's mulling a move to a public accounting firm in Minneapolis, where his résumé could probably land him a salary above $120,000. He'd miss his pension, and the feeling that he's doing something that, on balance, helps people.
But 14 years into his career, he's having doubts.
"It's nice to be able to serve the United States," he said, "but I don't like feeling like I am getting pushed to a bread line in order to continue doing that."

Full text: CARACAS, Venezuela -- Leaders of Venezuela's opposition on Tuesday set in motion a plan to try to oust President Nicolás Maduro and create a caretaker government until new elections can be held.
The National Assembly, the opposition-controlled legislative body, declared Mr. Maduro illegitimate, hoping to trigger a constitutional mechanism that would allow the head of the assembly to take over the leadership.
It was not immediately clear what effect the move would have or how Mr. Maduro's government would react.
Rafael Chavero, professor of constitutional law at the Central University of Venezuela, said the next steps were not clear. "You have to think outside the box," he said. "There is no magic formula to get out of dictatorships."
The National Assembly has been largely powerless since Venezuela's Supreme Court, which is packed by Maduro loyalists, attempted to dissolve it in March 2017.
But pressure has been mounting on Mr. Maduro, both domestically and abroad, since he was sworn in for his second term last week. Not long after the ceremony, an opposition leader, Juan Guaidó, the head of the National Assembly, said he would be ready to take over as president and hold fair elections if Venezuelans and the armed forces backed him.
On Tuesday, Vice President Mike Pence spoke with Mr. Guaidó on the phone to recognize "his courageous leadership" and to "express the United States' resolute support for the National Assembly of Venezuela as the only legitimate democratic body in the country," according to a statement from the office of the vice president.
Earlier, on Twitter, Mr. Pence said the United States "strongly supports the courageous decision by Juan Guaidó" to "declare the country's presidency vacant."
Mr. Guaidó has also received support from Luis Almagro, the secretary general of the Organization of American States, who called him the country's "interim president."
The expressions of support have emboldened those opposition leaders who remain in Venezuela -- and who have not been imprisoned -- to pursue the high-stakes plan to try to oust Mr. Maduro. They have extended an olive branch to the security forces in the hope that enough middle- and low-level members break ranks, and that Mr. Maduro loses a critical pillar of support.
Until recent days, the National Assembly had been regarded as ineffectual, and led by politicians who had lost popular support as their efforts to challenge Mr. Maduro faltered repeatedly. It was also stymied by divisions in its ranks and a ruthless security apparatus that has jailed critics and opponents, tortured hundreds of suspected dissidents and foiled rebellions within the security forces.
But longtime Venezuela watchers say this challenge to the president comes at a time of unprecedented opposition to Mr. Maduro.
"It's almost a now-or-never moment," said Fernando Cutz, a former senior White House official who helped shape Venezuela policy under the Trump and Obama administrations.
The country's authoritarian president was inaugurated for a second term amid a collapsing economy and a growing humanitarian crisis. As inflation has soared and food and medicine have become acutely scarce, Venezuelans have been fleeing their nation in droves. As of last November, more than three million people had left, according to the United Nations.
Ahead of Mr. Maduro's inauguration, a group of countries that includes Canada, Colombia, Brazil, Peru and Argentina issued a statement calling Mr. Maduro's second term "illegitimate" and his government "dictatorial and oppressive."
Mr. Guaidó, 35, has stopped short of calling himself the nation's rightful leader. But the day after Mr. Maduro's second swearing-in, Mr. Guaidó invoked an article of Venezuela's Constitution that transfers power to the president of the National Assembly in the event that the presidency becomes vacant.
Mr. Guaidó was not a household name at home or abroad before he was sworn in as the new leader of the National Assembly on Jan. 5. But on Sunday, his profile rose dramatically after masked agents from Venezuela's intelligence service took him into custody.
The men grabbed him at gunpoint and hustled him into a car -- but seemed unsure what to do once they had him, Mr. Guaidó told The Times in an interview.
They questioned him on his plans to assume the country's leadership and call a new election, and then let him go, Mr. Guaidó said on Monday from the plain office that serves as the headquarters of his political party, Popular Will.
"They asked me if we were serious people, and I said that of course, that we could protect the Venezuelan people and that Maduro could not do it," Mr. Guaidó said.
He said he had assured the men "there would be amnesty for all those who support us." Some of them removed their masks, saying, "Look at our faces and don't forget us," he said.
Then they let him go.
While that exchange cannot be independently confirmed, the fact that Mr. Guaidó was released may indicate cracks in the security apparatus that has kept Mr. Maduro in power until now. It helped bolster opposition leaders' belief that they stand a good chance of seizing power from Mr. Maduro and holding a new election.
"We are certain that we are taking the proper steps not to merely declare, but to execute" a peaceful transition of power, Mr. Guaidó said. "I think it is underway."
The key would be to persuade those who remain loyal to the government that they can switch allegiances and help rebuild a country devastated by an economic meltdown, acute food and medicine shortages and rampant violence, he said.
Venezuela's communications minister, Jorge Rodríguez, called the detention of Mr. Guaidó a rogue operation that had not been ordered by the government. He said the men who carried it out had been "dismissed" and would be punished.
In the wake of Mr. Guaidó's detention, Mr. Maduro dismissed his political rivals, saying they have long sought to seize power through "adventure, improvisation, coups." Their plan, he said, was destined to fail.
"Here the people of Venezuela will continue to rule with Nicolás Maduro at the head of the presidency of the country," Mr. Maduro said in remarks to the Constituent Assembly.
Mr. Guaidó is an industrial engineer who got his start in politics through activism in student movements. He was a protégé of Leopoldo López, a prominent opposition leader who was jailed during street protests in 2014 and is currently under house arrest in Caracas.
Mr. Guaidó is cleareyed about the risks he is taking, he said. He still bears scars from being shot with rubber bullets during street protests last year.
"Anyone who gets involved in opposition efforts today can fare very poorly," he said.
Mr. Guaidó has called on Venezuelans to take to the streets on Jan. 23 for mass demonstrations backing his bid to remove Mr. Maduro.
In recent months, opposition leaders have struggled to organize large, sustained demonstrations amid skepticism by Venezuelans that the opposition can bring about change. Many also fear the increasingly brutal reprisals of the security forces.
Mr. Cutz, the former White House official, said he feared that the opposition could emerge severely weakened if it failed to get people to protest in large numbers.
"If Maduro emerges victorious, then I feel like we are left with a relatively high likelihood of Venezuela ending up like Cuba," he said. "This will become the status quo, and everyone will kind of accept it."

Full text: LONDON -- Ever since European apothecaries began distilling gin and selling it as a cure-all in the 16th century, the juniper-flavored liquor has been revered as a medicine, vilified for fueling public disorder and consumed in a multitude of every-season cocktails.
Now, it is stirring up a specialized tourist trade in the homeland of London dry gin thanks in part to entrepreneurial bottling and branding.
After surging for a decade, gin sales in Britain reached nearly 2 billion pounds, or about $2.6 billion, in Britain through last fall, compared with £1.26 billion for the same period in 2017, according to the Wine and Spirit Trade Association. Drinkers of pink and flavored versions have helped make it the country's second-most-popular spirit, ahead of whiskeys and behind only vodka, the group said.
Gin has gotten so popular in Britain that the country's Office for National Statistics added it back to the basket of goods it uses to measure inflation after a 13-year absence.
Many of the newer products share the flavor of juniper, but others vary widely from traditional dry gin, which, by European law, must be distilled from natural plant materials and have a minimum of 37.5 percent alcohol by volume.
The revival has spawned gin-flavored marmalade and gin-scented candles, prompting fears of overkill among some British producers. As a result, they are seeking new growth overseas.
The birth of a new boom
Sam Galsworthy and Fairfax Hall, childhood friends from Britain, were working in the beverage industry in the United States in the early 2000s and watching microbreweries and craft distilleries multiply around them.
They set about starting a gin distillery in West London in 2007, but were quickly stymied by bureaucratic rules stretching back more than 250 years.
In 1751, British officials, worried that too many people were succumbing to so-called mother's ruin, passed the Gin Act to stamp out small-scale and home production by limiting gin making to stills with a capacity of at least 1,800 liters.
Mr. Galsworthy and Mr. Hall lobbied the government to ease the restriction, and in 2009, their company, Sipsmith, was granted a license to produce gin. The move opened the door for other small distilleries.
Gin making has exploded in Britain since then. The number of distilleries grew to 419 in 2018 from 113 in 2009, according to the Office for National Statistics.
The distilleries have become popular tourist destinations. Sipsmith says it gets about 25,000 visitors a year. Taste-testers like that -- those buying the experience as well as the gin -- have helped fuel the growth in sales.
"It's part of a food culture that probably didn't exist in the U.K. 20 years ago," said Miles Beale, chief executive of Britain's Wine and Spirit Trade Association. "People are drinking less, but they're more interested in what they're drinking. They will spend money on it."
The benefit of a good back story
Ian Puddick was renovating the London building that housed his plumbing business in 2013 when he discovered that it was once home to a bakery where illicit gin was made.
He tracked down the owners' descendants, and although they didn't give him a recipe, they identified several ingredients. With that and some guesswork, he came up with Old Bakery Gin, which is now sold at Harrods and Fortnum & Mason.
Mr. Puddick's tale is one of many origin stories whetting the appetite of the new generation of gin connoisseurs. Oscar Dodd, a Fortnum & Mason buyer, said shoppers often wanted to learn more about the provenance or ingredients of their purchases.
"They're nearly all looking for something new and exciting," he said. "There's a social currency with gin. You want to introduce your friends."
Still, the proliferation of new gins is a challenge for relative neophytes like Mr. Puddick.
"That brand loyalty, getting people to choose your brand above others, is definitely getting tougher," he said.
A heavyweight sticks to the basics
Beefeater, a London staple since the 1800s, is sticking to basics even as rivals keep sprouting up. If the rise of sloe gin and snow globes with gin bottles leads to consumer fatigue, the company wants to make sure its product remains the main ingredient in gin-based cocktails.
"Gin is designed to work in many different directions," Desmond Payne, Beefeater's master distiller, said. "Very few people drink gin on its own. Gin should have the ability to be versatile and work in different directions."
Beefeater welcomes the industry's growth and has even produced some limited editions of new blends. Still, Mr. Payne is wary of making something too different from the product that the company sells 2.9 million nine-liter cases of a year.
The risk with some of the experimental gins that have emerged, Mr. Payne said, is that "they're too much about one particular thing," limiting their ability to work well in all types of cocktails.
'It's both grown-up and hipster'
Mr. Galsworthy of Sipsmith expects the gin boom to stall at some point. "Make no bones about it," he said, "the proliferation of it endangers the category in of itself."
He and other distillers are looking beyond Britain for new customers, sometimes getting snapped up by big alcohol companies that hope to capitalize on a global gin market that, according to the research firm Euromonitor, grew to about $15.5 billion in 2017 from about $10.5 billion in 2007.
In 2016, Sipsmith was acquired by Beam Suntory, which has also acquired Japanese and Spanish gins. Diageo, which owns popular brands like Gordon's and Tanqueray, added a Japanese-inspired gin to its offering.
Smaller entrants from other parts of the world are also getting into the market.
Dragon's Blood Gin has just started making gin in a custom-built distillery in Inner Mongolia, China. Peddlers Gin, a Shanghai brand, recently signed an international distribution deal. And new distilleries are popping up from Australia to Liechtenstein to the United States, said Nicholas Cook, the director of the Gin Guild in Britain.
Gin's appeal, he said, is that "it's both grown-up and hipster at the same time."
Joseph Judd, who helped found Peddlers Gin, said even as the company sought to increase its global reach, especially in Asia, it was hewing to the liquor's European heritage.
"I think it would be difficult to come with purely Chinese ingredients and disregard the British perspective," Mr. Judd said. "With gin, you have to respect the process and the history."

Full text: After rising for nine years in a so-so economy in the belief that prosperity was just around the corner, stocks swooned, even as growth picked up.
That left many investors wondering whether the economy is turning another corner into a place where danger, maybe even a recession and a prolonged bear market, lurk.
The S&P 500 dropped 13.5 percent during the fourth quarter, including dividends, giving the index a 4.4 percent loss for the year by that measure. It was the worst performance since 2008, despite strong corporate earnings and the best readings in several decades in unemployment and consumer confidence.
As 2019 unfolds and the economic picture becomes clearer, it is possible that stocks will have a sustained, orderly recovery, investment advisers say. But achieving that clarity will take time, so they encourage investors to demand a lot of evidence that a recession will be avoided before they commit money to stocks or other risky assets.
"A lot of the derating that happened in the second half of 2018 started off being driven by political risk, but in the last few weeks, it has been driven by concerns about growth and stability," said Kate Moore, chief equity strategist at BlackRock, referring to the decline in stocks. "I think that's going to go on in the first few weeks of 2019. Everyone's focused on economic data."
Ms. Moore highlighted surveys showing weaker-than-expected business conditions and added: "It's going to take time for that to work itself through the market. I would expect more volatility as we take in new data points."
Just how weak those data points are likely to be is hard to predict.
"The underlying fundamentals of the economy certainly have deteriorated," said Edward Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research. He noted that the five monthly regional business surveys conducted by Federal Reserve districts "were all extremely weak in December."
But the latest employment report was not. It showed 312,000 net jobs created last month.
"We have a very mixed economic picture right now," Mr. Yardeni said. "It all adds up to an economy that's slowing but probably still growing." If that's true, then 2019 may not be so bad for the market.
"Stocks are very cheap, with one important qualification," he said: "You have to believe the economy is not going to wind up in recession."
He then offered another qualification, about forthcoming corporate earnings reports: "We still have to curb our enthusiasm because we can't get too excited about the earnings outlook."
The tax cuts that took effect in 2018 sent earnings up so much for the year -- the latest estimate for the S&P 500 was 20.2 percent, according to FactSet Research -- that a 5 percent rise in earnings in 2019, aided by corporate buybacks, is about as much as Wall Street can expect, Mr. Yardeni said. FactSet's latest forecast is for a 7.3 percent increase.
Despite some good days for the market in January that may have been prompted by signs of flexibility from the Federal Reserve, the way stocks tumbled late in the year hardly inspires confidence. With anything like a repeat performance, investors will have to hope that other assets provide better protection than in 2018, when there were few places to hide.
"Cash was the only major asset class that posted positive returns in '18," according to a Bank of America report. Even the reed-thin 1.9 percent return on cash in money market funds was less than the 2.2 percent consumer inflation rate, the report said, but at least it was a positive number. Long-term government bonds, corporate bonds and gold all lost ground, although they beat the return of the S&P 500. Oil and foreign stocks were among the investments that did worse.
The average domestic stock fund lost 14.2 percent in the fourth quarter, with specialists in natural resources, technology and financial services leading the way down. These funds dropped 6.8 percent during the year, according to Morningstar. International stock funds outperformed during the quarter, losing 10.9 percent, but trailed badly for the full year, down 13.2 percent.
Bond funds lost 0.9 percent in the quarter and 1 percent for all of 2018. High-yield portfolios were particularly weak, off 4.6 percent for the quarter and 2.8 percent for the year.
Such across-the-board weakness is rare "because what tends to be bad for one asset tends to be good for some other asset somewhere," said Ben Inker, head of asset allocation for the investment firm GMO. "The basic exception is when there is a combination of rising rates and slowing growth. Risky assets don't like slowing growth, and fixed income doesn't like rising rates."
Mr. Inker, like many, is worried that the Fed could push a fragile economy into recession. That would be "fairly ugly for valuations" of American stocks, he said, and he would avoid them even if he were confident that a recession could be skirted. He prefers stocks and bonds in emerging markets, which are much cheaper than their counterparts in mature economies.
"We're reasonably bullish on our ability to make money in 2019, just not in the assets most people have most of their money in," he said.
One reason for the poor returns on stocks, especially in December, is that the Fed initially had not seemed to share the fear felt on Wall Street. When the Fed raised its target for short-term interest rates last month, the move was almost universally anticipated, but the statement about economic conditions and monetary policy made after the increase "was not as dovish as the market was hoping for," said Steve Kane, a bond fund manager at TCW.
Recent data "signals an economic slowdown," and not just in the United States, Mr. Kane said. Surveys "confirm a significant drop in manufacturing activity. There are also signals that growth in China is slowing dramatically and significantly," he said.
The flattening yield curve, with short-term interest rates approaching long-term rates, is consistent with an economy that is running out of steam, and a source of concern in itself. But recent remarks by Jerome H. Powell, the Federal Reserve chairman, that the central bank will have "patience" in deciding whether to raise rates, appeared to cheer the markets.
If rates are priced for a slowdown, some corporate bonds are not, Mr. Kane said. At least not yet. Spreads in yields between corporate and government debt have widened, taking bond prices down. Medium-term investment-grade corporate issues yielded 1.76 percentage points more than equivalent Treasury paper, as of Tuesday, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, and an index of high-yield debt yielded 4.65 points more. A two-point cushion is roughly where investment-grade spreads tend to peak during a slowdown, but high-yield spreads typically soar to 10 points.
"One should look at the fixed-income market as being more attractive to invest in 2019 than 2018, but one must still invest with some degree of caution, especially in the high-yield market," he said. "There will be better opportunities later in the year" in high yield, while "there is not too much downside to investment-grade credit at this point." He called it "a fairly good asset class if we're in the midst of a bear market in equities."
Stocks that Ms. Moore at BlackRock thinks would do comparatively well against such a backdrop are of companies that are financially strong and able to grow, even when economic growth is modest at best. Health care is her top sector because it has those defensive qualities, as well as pockets of innovation, such as in medical technology, that support high profit margins.
She said she is "not throwing in the towel on tech" in general, despite plunging share prices in big names like Apple and Facebook, and she said she particularly likes Asian tech companies. Ms. Moore also is "modestly encouraged" about emerging markets in Latin America and Asia, most notably Brazil and India.
Brian Singer, head of dynamic allocation strategies at William Blair & Company, has been investing "with a greater emphasis on risk management," he said. He finds American stocks "fundamentally less attractive" than others, such as emerging markets, including the two that Ms. Moore mentioned.
Among mature economies, Mr. Singer likes Britain, although he would rather wait until the question of its departure from the European Union, Brexit, is settled before stepping in, and Spain. Markets he is shunning, aside from the United States, are Japan, Canada, Mexico and South Africa. As for bonds, he is avoiding the high-yield market, and he talked up the virtues of another asset class that is often overlooked.
"In this environment, cash will be a relatively good alternative," he said. "It won't be a great return generator, but being cautious and holding cash is not a bad idea. It really is a time to remain defensive and have dry powder on hand."
With so much up in the air, Mr. Yardeni recommends not getting carried away. Investors should be selective about stocks and avoid index-tracking exchange-traded funds.
"This is probably a year for stock pickers," he said. "It's not a year for E.T.F.s."
He would emphasize domestic stocks and limit exposure to emerging markets, which may suffer from soft commodity prices, and to Europe, which is dealing with thorny issues like Brexit and Italy's recalcitrance in reining in government spending. The aging population bodes ill for long-term growth in Europe, too, Mr. Yardeni said, something that also applies in China.
He favors industries like technology, communications and media, which he expects to benefit over the long haul from the impending introduction of 5G, the fifth generation of mobile communications technology. Big banks and health care companies should do well, too, he said.
With investors focused on what's going wrong, Mr. Kane recommends that they also keep in mind what's going right, in particular the strong job market, although he noted that employment is often the last indicator to deteriorate as the economic cycle turns.
"If that part of the economy holds up, then this may not be a recession," he said. "You could get a very nice return for stocks if that turns out to be the environment." But he acknowledged that it's a big if.
A crucial question for him is whether the decline will be fairly mild by the time it's over, or something more severe, as in the 2008 financial crisis. For all the talk of recession, the losses so far have appeared calm and orderly, suggesting to him that too few investors have been asking the same question.
"Whether it's a garden-variety or end-of-days bear market," he said, "there's going to be panic, and we haven't gotten quite there yet."

Full text: After months of stock market declines, investment strategists are divided on appropriate responses.
There is a range of possible approaches, none as simple as the kind of straightforward investing that can lead to immediate rewards when the market is consistently rising.
Chris Brightman, chief investment officer at the investment advisory service Research Affiliates, for example, is currently unimpressed with most stocks.
"We do advise our investors to hold lower allocations to global equities -- particularly U.S. equities -- than normal," Mr. Brightman said. He urged broad diversification into such vehicles as Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, commodities and real estate investment trusts, as well as a tax-sheltered structure known as a master limited partnership. But he concedes that with "the exception of M.L.P.s," all are expensively priced.
Holding cash, in the form of a money-market fund, is another answer, but it is far from perfect, he said. "The problem with cash is you don't make any money," Mr. Brightman said. "It's the safest place to keep your money, but you get zero real return."
Nick Kalivas, senior equity product strategist at Invesco, said it was worth at least "thinking about" tweaking a portfolio to fortify it against risk.
He suggests funds that focus on stocks specifically selected because their fluctuations are low: They are known as low-volatility stocks, and they have outperformed the S&P 500 in 14 of the last 15 market downturns since 2011, according to Invesco.
Four times a year, Invesco compiles a list of the lowest-volatility stocks in the S&P 500. These are the companies whose shares are least affected by market turbulence. The current list features Coca-Cola as the least-volatile equity, followed by two utilities, the WEC Energy Group and Duke Energy, according to Mr. Kalivas.
Low-volatility stocks outperformed the market for most of 2018, according to Mo Haghbin, head of product research and development for Oppenheimer funds. Through December, portfolios of low-volatility stocks in the Oppenheimer Russell 1000 Dynamic Multifactor Exchange-Traded Fund lost 2.43 percent as opposed to the fund's benchmark, the Russell 1000, which lost 4.78 percent, Mr. Haghbin said. High-quality companies -- defined by superior grades on such metrics as return on assets, profits, margins and leverage -- also outperformed, losing 2.68 percent.
But investors who shift toward low-volatility portfolios should remember that such portfolios have historically lagged once the market turns up.
Two low-volatility E.T.F.s that outperformed the S&P 500 in 2018 were: Hartford Multifactor Low Volatility US Equity E.T.F., which was basically flat, and Invesco S&P 500 Low Volatility E.T.F., which lost just over 2 percent. The S&P 500 was down 6.2 percent last year.
Investors may also be wondering what to do about tech stocks, especially the Faangs (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google), which have been losing altitude rapidly after a seemingly endless ascent.
Through December, Facebook and Netflix were both down over 35 percent from their highs of last year. Apple and Amazon were each off more than 25 percent from their 2018 highs.
Although Kevin Landis is portfolio manager of the tech-focused Firsthand Technology Opportunities fund, he said he is wary of the big tech stocks. "When companies get bigger, they start looking more and more like government agencies," he said. "Even the biggest opportunities are at the saturation point. There's only so many iPhones you can sell."
With evidence of rising public concern about consumer privacy, Mr. Landis said, he expects to see greater regulation. "I spent the last 15 to 20 years being appalled at how readily people surrendered their own privacy," he said. "I welcome the idea that they've become more aware."
Mr. Landis said there were still good values in smaller tech companies. One major holding is Roku, which hopes to lure consumers who subscribe to cable. He contrasted its market cap of under $4 billion with Netflix's $111 billion market cap and said Roku was a better value.
But many advisers say investors should simply hold tight. Brian McMahon, manager of the Thornburg Investment Income Builder mutual fund, said that in many ways, the recent downturn "is pretty normal. This is not something to panic about." He said his largest investment, the CME Group, benefits from an active market. It makes good profits when people trade on options and futures contracts made on its platforms, he said. "CME Group benefits from volatility," he said.
In a similar vein, Kate Moore, chief equity strategist at BlackRock, said, "This is not a time to derisk and become completely defensive." There are still "pockets of quality" in the volatile markets, she added, citing the Chinese tech sector as one example.
But she said there were at least two major threats in the longer term. "We are increasingly concerned about long-term deficits and their impact on the bond market," she said. Bonds, already pressured in the near term by Federal Reserve rate increases, could also face long-term rate pressure from the ballooning Treasury financing required by mounting budget deficits.
Ms. Moore also said tech stocks could eventually lose value if new regulations were imposed to protect consumer privacy. "We don't expect any major regulatory changes in 2019," she said. "We certainly expect the government will impose regulations over the medium term."
Mr. Haghbin of Oppenheimer emphasized that portfolio decisions should reflect an investor's view of the larger economy. "If an investor feels that growth will continue to slow and risk appetite continue to decline, historically he would emphasize high-quality and low-volatility companies."
But, as Mr. Haghbin warned, investors may need to be nimble. "Things can change very quickly," he said.

G.M.'s Rosy Outlook
Lifts Its Stock Nearly 8%
General Motors executives on Friday bucked gloomy forecasts for growth and sent the automaker's shares soaring, promising investors stronger 2019 earnings and outlining ambitious plans for its Cadillac brand to challenge Tesla Inc. in the electric vehicle market.
G.M. said that despite forecasts of decline in the United States and China for passenger car sales, the company expects 2018 profit to exceed Wall Street expectations, and promised higher earnings per share in 2019. G.M.'s chief executive, Mary Barra, in her presentation to investors on Friday, stood her ground on cost-cutting actions that have provoked threats of retribution from President Trump and outrage from unions and elected officials.
"Because of the actions we have been taking for several years, General Motors enters 2019 leaner, more agile and positioned to win," Ms. Barra said.
The market cheered G.M.'s forecast, sending the company's stock up nearly 8 percent. REUTERS
ECONOMY
Cheaper Gas Sends Consumer Prices Down
Consumer prices slipped 0.1 percent last month, pulled down by sharply lower gas prices and cheaper air fares, used cars and mobile phone plans.
The consumer price index rose just 1.9 percent in December from a year earlier, the Labor Department said on Friday, the first time it has fallen below 2 percent since August 2017.
Excluding the volatile energy and food categories, core prices rose 0.2 percent for the third month in a row. They rose 2.2 percent from a year ago for the second straight month.
The figures suggest that the healthy economy is not yet creating widespread inflation pressures. That gives the Federal Reserve more leeway in deciding whether to raise short-term interest rates.
Fed policymakers lifted short-term rates four times last year and have forecast two more hikes this year. Yet some analysts think that slower United States and global growth, combined with low inflation, will keep the Fed from raising rates at all. AP
MEDIA
Fox Says It Won't Bid
For Disney Sports Stations
Twenty-First Century Fox said on Friday it does not plan to bid for any of the regional sports networks that Walt Disney Co. may need to sell to win the Justice Department's approval for its purchase of Fox's film and TV assets.
Fox's chairman, Lachlan Murdoch, said in November it was still an "open question" whether the company would buy back the regional sports networks it sold to Disney in July as part of the $71 billion deal.
Disney won a bidding war last year against the cable company Comcast Corp. to acquire Fox's assets. But the Justice Department has said Disney, which owns the cable sports network ESPN, must divest Fox's 22 networks that provide sports programming for regional and local markets.
After the Disney sale is completed, Fox will carve out a new company, including Fox News, Business, Sports and the Broadcasting Company, which it expects to have annual revenue of around $10 billion. REUTERS

Full text: CARACAS, Venezuela -- When President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela was sworn in for his second term on Thursday before the country's Supreme Court, a small group of supporters standing outside greeted the news by waving tiny flags with little enthusiasm.
The huge crowds that gathered to greet him after his first inauguration were nowhere to be seen.
In the years since Mr. Maduro first took office, violence and hunger have become emblematic, inflation has skyrocketed, and the migration of Venezuelans out of the country has reached unprecedented levels.
Mr. Maduro and his predecessor, Hugo Chávez, presided over the free fall of what was once Latin America's wealthiest nation. The country's economy continues to unravel at an alarming rate. And Mr. Maduro's re-election last year was widely denounced by other countries as fraudulent.
Venezuela's increasing isolation was evident inside the Supreme Court on Thursday. The presidents of Bolivia, Cuba, El Salvador and Nicaragua did attend the ceremony, along with representatives from China, Mexico and Turkey.
Notably absent, though, were representatives from the European Union and the United States, and members of the Lima Group -- 13 Latin American countries plus Canada that organized to find a solution to the crisis in Venezuela, and which last week announced that they would not recognize the legitimacy of Mr. Maduro's new term.
The Organization of American States said Thursday that it, too, would not recognize Mr. Maduro's new term as legitimate.
Despite these denunciations and the humanitarian crisis Venezuela is facing, Mr. Maduro is embarking on a term that extends until 2025.
So how did he get here, and how has he managed to hold on?
Here's what to know as Mr. Maduro begins his second term.
How was Maduro re-elected in such desperate conditions?
Mr. Maduro's re-election in May 2018 was widely criticized, with reports of coercion, fraud and electoral rigging.
He first came to power in a snap vote following Mr. Chávez's death in 2013, after the former leader had anointed him as successor.
But by the 2018 election, Venezuela's economy had plummeted to new lows as a result of mismanagement and corruption, and the country was in the midst of a crisis.
Despite that, election officials said Mr. Maduro won 68 percent of the vote. The chaotic state of the country and the desperation of poor voters may actually have contributed to Mr. Maduro's ability to maintain control.
Representatives of Mr. Maduro's party tracked those who voted by registering their "Fatherland Card" -- or national benefits card -- and promised aid and government subsidized food handouts if he was re-elected.
Independent international observers were not on hand, and a crackdown on critics left several of them unable to participate. Opposition leaders called for a boycott of the election, and that, combined with the disillusionment of many longtime government supporters, meant the turnout was exceptionally low. Less than half of the country's voters cast ballots.
Mr. Maduro's stifling of dissent and targeting of the opposition has been widely reported. Since 2014, Human Rights Watch says, it has documented hundreds of cases of mistreatment of government opponents, including at least 31 cases of torture.
More than 12,800 people have been arrested because of links to antigovernment protests, according to the Venezuelan human rights organization Foro Penal, including demonstrators, bystanders and people taken from their homes without warrants.
The two groups on Thursday released a report detailing the detention and torture of intelligence and security forces accused of plotting against the government.
How strong is his grip on power?
Despite international criticism and a crisis at home, Mr. Maduro has won the loyalty of the country's powerful military by handing its leaders control of the food and oil industries as well as profitable mining regions.
Ricardo Sánchez, 35, is a member of the powerful Constituent Assembly, a new legislature created by Mr. Maduro and assigned to rewrite the country's Constitution. He said that support for the party was as strong as ever.
"We are convinced that the majority of the people who voted for the president in May are united today with loyalty and discipline to be with Nicolás Maduro for another six years," he said.
But there are clear signs of growing discontent.
Recent desertions include Christian Zerpa, a Supreme Court judge and longtime government loyalist. He fled to the United States, denouncing Mr. Maduro as incompetent and the elections as unfair.
In August, Mr. Maduro was purportedly targeted in a bizarre drone attack. And the Trump administration held secret meetings with rebellious military officers from Venezuela over the past year to discuss their plans to overthrow Mr. Maduro, according to American officials, before deciding against aiding the plotters.
International sanctions and plummeting oil production have further weakened the already floundering economy.
While the country's opposition lost much power because of government persecution and the forced exile of some of its most prominent figures, last week's election of Juan Guaidó as the new president of the opposition-controlled National Assembly has renewed calls to remove Mr. Maduro from power.
"We are going to effectively represent the people," Mr. Guaidó said, "and we have plans to call the people to the streets in legitimate protest."
Who still supports him?
Mr. Maduro has found some allies in the region, including President Evo Morales of Bolivia, a fellow socialist who attended the inauguration.
And Mexico's new leftist president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, invited Mr. Maduro to his own inauguration and has taken a friendlier stance in relations with Venezuela than his predecessor.
Russia has remained a staunch ally, with President Vladimir V. Putin voicing his support for Mr. Maduro during a December meeting in Moscow. A year earlier, Russia agreed to restructure some $3 billion in loans to prevent Venezuela from defaulting.
Venezuela has also received recent financial support from China. After Mr. Maduro visited Beijing in September, he secured $5 billion in loans.
Within Venezuela, loyal "chavista" governors, named for their support of Mr. Chávez and his revolutionary leftist policies, expressed support for Mr. Maduro in a news conference on Wednesday. Héctor Rodríguez, governor of the state of Miranda, denounced Mr. Maduro's critics and urged the country's opposition to "reconsider" their criticism of him.
Still, there has been widespread international condemnation of Mr. Maduro's re-election and support from nations in the region is crumbling.
Last week, the Lima Group urged Mr. Maduro to hand over power to the National Assembly until another election could be held.
Argentina on Thursday said it had suspended entry of high-level Venezuelan government officials. Paraguay cut off diplomatic relations and closed its embassy in Venezuela, and said the electoral process was illegitimate.
What's the impact on the people?
Daily life in Venezuela has become unrecognizable from what it was just a few years ago. Where once the government built homes, clinics and schools for the poor as part of its socialist policy, people now find themselves without the most basic necessities.
The country's health system has collapsed, leaving many without access to lifesaving medicine. Hunger is common, and the shelves of grocery stores lie bare. And there is no sense conditions are improving. The International Monetary Fund anticipates that Venezuela's inflation rate will reach 10 million percent in 2019, becoming one of the worst cases of hyperinflation in modern history.
More than three million people have fled Venezuela since 2014, according to the United Nations migration agency, setting off a regional crisis that has left neighboring countries grappling with how to respond
Some Venezuelans who remain in the country have reached their breaking point.
Margarita Uzcategui, 64, who lives in what used to be a thriving neighborhood of Caracas, described water shortages and electricity cuts that can last for up to 12 hours.
"I never imagined I would have to live like this," she said.
While she said the government has failed her, she doesn't trust the opposition, either.
"For me, this is the end. This has to be the end," said Mrs. Uzcategui. "If we are living like this now, imagine six more years. We will have no food, water, electricity. God help us."

Full text: The momentum behind the American economy is strong. In 2018, unemployment hit its lowest rate in 49 years, 3.7 percent. Real wages were (finally) increasing and inflation remained muted. In 2019, growth is projected to slow but still remain above 2 percent.
Yet risks abound. The trade war and the escalating drama over the government shutdown threaten growth. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve's inaugural Financial Stability Report, an early warning system for the financial markets, recently highlighted the vulnerabilities created by investors who show a "high tolerance for risk-taking" in the market for corporate debt. The economy's continued health will hinge on whether big Wall Street banks can withstand shocks caused by these or other threats and continue lending.
On this front, it is far from certain that banks and their regulators are prepared.
Years of low interest rates have brought about excessive business debt and elevated prices for corporate bonds. The corporate bond market has swelled to nearly $7 trillion. The debt owed by businesses as a percentage of gross domestic product is at a record high. But the credit quality of investment-grade bonds has deteriorated. Underwriting standards on "leveraged loans" to risky companies have eroded. And until recently, yields on junk debt remained low, a sign that investors are too willing to take on the risk of bonds held by companies with less-than-stellar credit.
These vulnerabilities can amplify shocks and create systemic disruptions. In a market downturn, widespread downgrades of corporate bonds could induce a sell-off, precipitating sharp declines in the price of bonds and feeding a cycle of further downgrades, margin calls and sell-offs. Highly leveraged corporations may have difficulty refinancing or getting more credit, increasing the risk of corporate defaults and bankruptcies.
Cracks are already forming. In December, borrowing in the high-yield bond market came to a standstill. Deals in the leveraged loan market are also delayed from a lack of interest from mutual funds and collateralized loan obligation managers, the largest buyers of leveraged loans. These events signal trouble ahead for highly indebted companies seeking more financing.
This instability raises a basic question: Are the big banks strong enough to handle it? The Fed seems to think they are. The banks are better capitalized than before the 2008 financial crisis, and stress tests show they can withstand steep declines in prices of assets that they hold. But the Fed may be overly optimistic.
Wall Street banks have significant exposure to corporate debt. They underwrite and make markets in corporate bonds, make leveraged loans, invest in collateralized loan obligations, extend credit to businesses, including highly leveraged hedge funds, and buy and sell protection on corporate debt in the credit default swap market.
In a crisis, these exposures could serve as a channel for contagion in a highly interconnected financial system dominated by large banks.
Yet bank stress tests don't adequately capture this dynamic. Stress tests don't consider how a firm's response to a shock can reverberate. They also understate the effect of financial-sector distress on the economy. This helps explain why the tests have allowed bank capital to decline slightly despite elevated asset prices and increasingly stringent scenarios.
Stress tests also rely primarily on risk-based capital ratios, which vary based on the perceived riskiness of a bank's assets. These ratios are routinely gamed and, as we learned in 2008, are a poor indicator of a firm's financial health. A more credible yardstick is the supplementary leverage ratio, which is a simple cap on the percentage of a bank's funding from debt. But based on recent remarks by senior Fed officials, its role in stress testing may be eliminated altogether.
To be sure, reforms put in place after the 2008 financial crisis have enhanced bank resilience. The eight global systemically important banks in the United States now abide by additional capital and liquidity requirements, including a surcharge intended to ensure they absorb the effects of their own failure without disrupting the broader economy. But here, too, there are deficiencies. In calculating the surcharge, the Fed relies on incomplete historical data that ignore losses that taxpayer bailouts averted in the last crisis. These deficiencies don't inspire confidence.
Recessions that emerge from distress in the financial sector tend to run deeper and last longer than other recessions. As the former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker recently warned, the danger comes from "standing by while bubbles and excesses threaten financial markets."
So far, regulators appear to be doing exactly that -- or worse.
In recent months, regulators have proposed to reduce liquidity buffers of banks with as much as $700 billion in assets, dilute the strength and frequency of stress tests, water down the Volcker Rule prohibition on risky trading and cut leverage capital requirements for corporate derivatives exposures. Pressed by lobbyists and others, regulators are now contemplating a further weakening of the surcharge on the eight systemically important banks.
To prevent a repeat of 2008, regulators must look beyond the concerns of bank lobbyists. Instead of cutting capital to increase shareholder returns or making it easier to bail out giant financial institutions the next time around, regulators must address threats to the economy. This means requiring thicker capital cushions for the big banks and tighter leveraged loan underwriting standards. These steps would help secure a safer financial system and possibly avoid another crisis.

Full text: Stocks clinched their fourth consecutive gain Wednesday as indexes around the world build on their early 2019 rally. The gains for indexes in the United States faded slightly after President Trump and Democratic leaders said Mr. Trump cut short a meeting on ending the partial shutdown of the federal government.
The last four-day winning streak for the S&P 500 ended in mid-September. The index, the benchmark for many mutual funds, retirement plans and investment professionals, has climbed 9.9 percent since Dec. 24.
Negotiators from the United States and China extended their trade talks to a third day, which investors took as a sign the trade discussions were productive even though the two sides did not announce any breakthroughs. Stocks linked to faster economic growth, such as technology and energy companies, kept rising.
Oil prices rose for the ninth day out of 10, bringing United States crude back above $50 a barrel for the first time in almost a month. European stocks made solid gains and Asian indexes jumped.
Wednesday's rally thinned when Trump tweeted that his meeting with Congressional leaders was a "waste of time," while top Democrats said Trump left after they didn't agree to fund the border wall Trump has demanded.
The partial government shutdown has lasted almost three weeks, meaning 800,000 federal employees are temporarily out of work or working unpaid. Because many federal agencies are shuttered, the government cannot send out a variety of payments, government-backed mortgage loan applications are not being approved, companies cannot go public on stock exchanges, and a number of economic reports watched by investors are not being released.
U.S. Bank Wealth Management chief equity strategist Terry Sandven said the economy looks solid, but this year is likely to be bumpy because investors will be very sensitive to trade threats and signs of slower growth.
"We're in this roller-coaster mode," he said. "We're in a trading range that we'll be in for the course of the year."
The S&P 500 climbed 10.55 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,584.96. The Dow Jones industrial average picked up 91.67 points, or 0.4 percent, to 23,879.12. The Nasdaq composite rose 60.08 points, or 0.9 percent, to 6,957.08.
Mr. Sandven said stocks could keep rising next week as American corporations start to report their fourth-quarter results, as their profits are expected to rise compared to last year.
"You still have moderating earnings growth, non-problematic inflation and relatively low interest rates," he said.
Experts think the trade negotiations may continue for months.
Chipmaker Micron Technology surged 5.6 percent to $35.93 and competitor Broadcom climbed 3.7 percent to $244.77. Many chip companies have manufacturing operations in China and make big chunks of their sales there. Traders felt that made them especially vulnerable in the trade spat. They were also concerned about an abrupt slowdown in the global economy and the possibility that supplies were too large.
Oil prices hit their highest in almost a month after rising for the ninth day in the last 10. United States crude rose 5.2 percent to $52.36 a barrel in New York. It has jumped 15 percent so far in 2019.
Lennar jumped 7.9 percent to $46.29 and other homebuilders also rose after its chief executive, Stuart Miller, said more potential buyers have been coming to Lennar's model homes recently as mortgage rates dipped. That could be a sign sales will pick up.
Homebuilder stocks took huge losses in 2018 as high prices and rising mortgage rates hurt sales.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was down 0.02 points at 2.71 percent.
Gold rose 0.5 percent to $1,289.30 an ounce.
The dollar slipped to 108.28 yen from 108.65 yen. The euro climbed to $1.1544 from $1.1443.

In Wales, a Renewed Fervor for Nuclear

Full text: CEMAES, Wales -- Not far from this harbor village of brightly painted houses on Anglesey Island, a huge construction project is underway. Gates and wire fences are up. Archaeologists are sifting through dirt to document stony dwellings dating from 100 B.C. A technical school is welcoming apprentices eager to learn how to maneuver in high-tech control rooms and operate water-cooling systems.
The activity is all tied to a plan by Horizon Nuclear Power to turn this rugged outpost into the home of a plant that could be critical not just to the company, but to the Welsh economy and Britain's energy future.
Horizon, a subsidiary of the Japanese conglomerate Hitachi, is in private talks with the British government over how and when it might build a nuclear plant here at the northern tip of Wales. If the parties reach a deal on how the project's estimated 15 billion pound ($18.95 billion) cost will be paid, this stronghold of Welsh culture will change in ways that residents are just starting to consider.
Some people worry about nonstop truck traffic, the blasting of rock and soil, and the waves of outsiders the plant would bring to live and work in the area.
Others in northern Wales herald the economic benefit the potentially enormous investment could have. They see the Horizon plant, which is expected to produce enough electricity for 5.5 million homes, as a vehicle for rebirth.
The British government, eager for reliable, low-carbon energy to replace aging coal plants and nuclear reactors, has been encouraging. Greg Clark, the business and energy minister, told Parliament in June that the new Wales plant, Wylfa Newydd, was "next" in Britain's nuclear "pipeline" and that the government would consider making a "direct investment" in it with Japanese government agencies.
But Horizon and Hitachi executives are frustrated with the pace of the talks. In an interview, Duncan Hawthorne, Horizon's chief executive, said Hitachi had spent "billions" of pounds on the project, including the cost of acquiring it from two German utilities in 2012.
"It is a very long and expensive road here," he said, adding that "the next several months will be critical."
Hitachi, without providing exact figures, wants government financing from Britain and Japan to help attract outside investors like pension funds that seek long-term income streams. Investments by the governments would also help lower Horizon's risk rating.
The Wylfa Newydd plant, with two giant reactors, would be just the second nuclear plant to be built in the United Kingdom since the 1990s. Once a world leader, Britain's nuclear industry atrophied after serious accidents in Ukraine and the United States spurred broad resistance to nuclear power.
Britain has legally committed to cutting carbon emissions. As a result, the government is reassessing its energy options amid a decline in natural gas from the North Sea oil fields and a decision to phase out the use of coal.
Proponents of wind and solar energy say Britain should be putting its money there, but those sources have not been able to match the steady supply of power nuclear energy produces. So nuclear plants are back in vogue. One is being built at Hinkley Point in southwest England, and at least four more are planned.
"It's hard to conceive that nuclear does not have an important role to play," said Steve Holliday, a former chief executive of National Grid, the British power system operator.
Britain's renewed interest in nuclear power stands out among Western countries, where such plants have become forbiddingly costly and complex. The challenges were evident in October when Toshiba scrapped plans to build a plant in northern England.
Delays and cost overruns at plants being built at Olkiluoto, Finland, and Flamanville, France, have hurt the industry's reputation elsewhere in Europe. Germany, the region's top manufacturing power, is phasing out nuclear power. An abundance of cheap shale gas has undercut interest in the United States, although two new plants are in the works.
Hitachi is intent on the plant in Wales, Mr. Hawthorne said, because it would provide a key European foothold after the 2011 Fukushima accident dampened interest in Japan. Horizon executives have described the area as an ideal location, with water from the sea to be used in the cooling system and the rocky terrain able to bear the massive concrete structure that nuclear power demands.
For Anglesey Island, with a population of about 70,000, the project would provide a huge lift and create around 850 permanent jobs. Many local residents favor it because a smaller nuclear facility on a nearby seaside bluff was a dependable employer for nearly 50 years before closing in 2015.
Gareth Winston Roberts, a local councilor who worked at the plant -- known as Wylfa, after the bluff -- before retiring in the 1990s, called it "a godsend."
"It kept people here," he said. "It produced a lot of engineers."
Gwen Parry-Jones worked there beginning in 1989. Since April, she has been Horizon's executive director and is steering the negotiations with the government. For the previous decade, she was an executive at EDF Energy, a French-owned utility that has taken over much of Britain's nuclear system.
"I benefited from having a nuclear power station effectively on my doorstep as a young scientist," she said. "I strongly feel that we are benefiting from the fact that there is an existing nuclear power station here."
The need for jobs is obvious. The Wylfa plant still employs some technicians to remove fuel rods, but a local chemical plant closed in 2004 and an aluminum smelter closed in 2009. Britain's plan to leave the European Union this year could hurt another key employer, the port at Holyhead, a hub for trade with Ireland, an E.U. member.
"We find ourselves in a position where we need that one big project," said Edward T. Jones, a local cattle farmer who also lectures on economics at Bangor Business School in North Wales.
Some local leaders also see the plant as a vehicle for preserving the island's character.
"We still have got the Welsh language, and it's quite a strong part of our community," said Llinos Medi, the leader of the island's governing council. "With work we can keep our young people and our culture and our Welsh language."
But some residents believe the plant could damage the island's rural charm and hurt tourism. A walk along the pebble beach at Cemlyn Bay, a wildlife sanctuary next to the construction site, suggests why.
The old Wylfa plant sits at the beach's eastern end. Because the new one will be far larger, much of the surrounding landscape must be reshaped to accommodate it. The North Wales Wildlife Trust has been asking that fragile wildlife populations -- thousands of terns nest here every summer -- be taken into consideration.
"It is going to completely spoil the area," said Simon Walker, a retired businessman who was on the shore with his wife, Susan, watching his four dogs splash in the water.
Last month, in a nod to environmental concerns, the Welsh government said it would review the site preparations. Horizon said it disagreed with the move, which could result in delays.
Whether the plant proceeds will probably come down to how it will be paid for.
A key yardstick is the Hinkley Point facility in southwest England. The government is financing that plant's £20 billion cost through a so-called contract for difference, an arrangement that guarantees developers of big energy projects a long-term base rate for the power they produce. If the price of electricity falls below that rate, customers pay higher bills to make up the difference.
At Hinkley Point, the British government guaranteed the owners an inflation-indexed price of £92.50 per megawatt-hour for 35 years. That is about 50 percent higher than current energy rates. Not surprisingly, the government has been criticized for potentially saddling consumers with expensive electricity for decades.
With Horizon, the British government is pushing for a rate up to 30 percent lower than what it agreed to for Hinkley Point. Mr. Hawthorne of Horizon said he anticipated the Wales plant could provide power at "a significant price reduction" compared with Hinkley Point.
The question is whether a British government consumed with the process of leaving the European Union is prepared to move quickly on the Anglesey Island project -- and how pivotal it believes the plant is to its climate change promises.

2018 Was The Best Year In History!

Full text: The world is, as everyone knows, going to hell, but there's still the nervous thrill of waiting to see precisely which dark force will take us down. Will the economy collapse first, the ice sheets melt first, or chaos and war envelop us first?
So here's my antidote to that gloom: Let me try to make the case that 2018 was actually the best year in human history.
Each day on average, about another 295,000 people around the world gained access to electricity for the first time, according to Max Roser of Oxford University and his Our World in Data website. Every day, another 305,000 were able to access clean drinking water for the first time. And each day an additional 620,000 people were able to get online for the first time.
Never before has such a large portion of humanity been literate, enjoyed a middle-class cushion, lived such long lives, had access to family planning or been confident that their children would survive. Let's hit pause on our fears and frustrations and share a nanosecond of celebration at this backdrop of progress.
On a dirt road in rural Angola a few years ago, I met a woman named Delfina Fernandes who had lost 10 children, out of 15; she had endured perhaps the greatest blow any parent can, and she had suffered it 10 times.
Yet such child deaths are becoming far less common. Only about 4 percent of children worldwide now die by the age of 5. That's still horrifying, but it's down from 19 percent in 1960 and 7 percent in 2003.
Indeed, children today in Mexico or Brazil are less likely to die by the age of 5 than American children were as recently as 1970.
The big news that won't make a headline and won't appear on television is that 15,000 children died around the world in the last 24 hours. But in the 1990s, it was 30,000 kids dying each day.
Perhaps it seems Pollyannish or tasteless to trumpet progress at a time when there is so much butchery, misrule and threat hanging over us. But I cover the butchery and misrule every other day of the year, and I do this annual column about progress to try to place those tragedies in perspective.
One reason for this column is that journalism is supposed to inform people about the world, and it turns out that most Americans (and citizens of other countries, too) are spectacularly misinformed.
For example, nine out of 10 Americans say in polls that global poverty is worsening or staying the same, when in fact the most important trend in the world is arguably a huge reduction in poverty. Until about the 1950s, a majority of humans had always lived in "extreme poverty," defined as less than about $2 a person per day. When I was a university student in the early 1980s, 44 percent of the world's population lived in extreme poverty.
Now, fewer than 10 percent of the world's population lives in extreme poverty, as adjusted for inflation.
Likewise, Americans estimate that 35 percent of the world's children have been vaccinated. In fact, 86 percent of all 1-year-olds have been vaccinated against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis.
"Everyone seems to get the world devastatingly wrong," Dr. Hans Rosling, a brilliant scholar of international health, wrote in "Factfulness," published in 2018, after his death. "Every group of people I ask thinks the world is more frightening, more violent and more hopeless -- in short, more dramatic -- than it really is."
I suspect that this misperception reflects in part how we in journalism cover news. We cover wars, massacres and famines but are less focused on progress.
In the last year, I've covered atrocities against the Rohingya in Myanmar, starvation in Yemen, climate change in Bangladesh, refugees and child marriage at home, and some of the world's worst poverty, in Central African Republic. All those stories deserve more attention, not less. But I never wrote columns or newsletters about three nations that registered astounding progress against authoritarianism and poor governance in 2018, Armenia, Ethiopia and Malaysia.
It is of course true that there are huge challenges ahead. The gains against global poverty and disease seem to be slowing, and climate change is an enormous threat to poor nations in particular. And the United States is an outlier, where life expectancy is falling, not rising as in most of the world.
So there's plenty to fret about. But a failure to acknowledge global progress can leave people feeling hopeless and ready to give up. In fact, the gains should show us what is possible and spur greater efforts to improve opportunity worldwide.
Every other day of the year, go ahead and gnash your teeth about President Trump or Nancy Pelosi, but take a break today (remember, just for a nanosecond!) to recognize that arguably the most important thing in the world now is not Trumpian bombast. Rather, it may be the way the world's poorest and most desperate inhabitants are enjoying improved literacy and well-being, leading to a day when no mom will again lose 10 children.

Full text: In September 2014, a bourbon brand called Kentucky Owl began to appear on liquor-store shelves around Louisville. The American whiskey market was booming, and dozens of new bourbons were showing up each year. But Kentucky Owl was different. Released exclusively within the state in tiny quantities and produced by the scion of an old Kentucky whiskey family, it had an undeniable mystique -- and a price tag of $170.
To skeptics, Kentucky Owl was proof that the whiskey trend had reached its Tulip Mania moment. At the time, few bourbons commanded even $50 at retail. Plus, the man behind the brand, Dixon Dedman, didn't even make the whiskey himself; he bought barrels from other distilleries, then blended them. Surely the bubble was about to pop.
It didn't. Within a few weeks, nearly every bottle of Kentucky Owl had sold out. On the secondary market, flippers were asking -- and getting -- five times what they had paid in stores. "Before you knew it, before anybody had reviewed it, you had people camping out to buy a bottle of Kentucky Owl," said Fred Minnick, the editor of Bourbon+ magazine and the author of "Bourbon: The Rise, Fall and Rebirth of an American Whiskey."
Several factors gave Kentucky Owl a boost. It had heritage: Mr. Dedman, whose family runs a century-old inn popular with bourbon fans, named it after a long-defunct brand created by his great-great-grandfather. Early hype by retailers, along with rumors about the source of the whiskey, also built early interest.
Above all, Kentucky Owl debuted at a moment when whiskey fans, flush with money from a surging heartland economy, were willing to pay extra to get the next hot thing in bourbon. Soon, Kentucky Owl had achieved cult status -- and signaled a fundamental change in the American whiskey market.
"People have called us the Screaming Eagle of bourbon," Mr. Dedman said in August, referring to the $3,000-per-bottle cabernet sauvignon whose debut, in 1995, represented a shift toward stratospheric luxury in the Napa Valley wine industry.
Not that he's complaining. In January 2017, less than three years after introducing Kentucky Owl, Mr. Dedman and his business partner sold the brand to SPI Group, the Luxembourg-based company best known for making Stolichnaya vodka, for an undisclosed sum rumored to be in the high seven figures. Six months later, the new owners revealed plans for a $150 million "Kentucky Owl Park" in Bardstown, an hour southeast of Louisville, featuring not just a distillery but a convention center, two lakes and, eventually, a luxury hotel. The company broke ground in November 2017, at an event attended by Governor Matt Bevin, and it plans to open the first phase of the site in 2020.
The brand's rapid ascent took Mr. Dedman by surprise. "I never had a vision for how fast this thing would grow," he said.
You could say the same thing about the Kentucky whiskey industry itself. Although the bourbon market has been growing for almost two decades, a transformation has taken place in the last five years, a reshaping of the industry's potential that most people didn't see coming and are only now starting to grapple with.
Between 2012 and 2017, sales of bourbon whiskey -- 95 percent of which is made in Kentucky -- soared by more than 50 percent, to $3.3 billion. To keep up with demand, nearly two dozen new distilleries have opened in Kentucky in the last five years, including three around Bardstown, a town of 13,000 that sits in the center of bourbon country. Established companies like Beam Suntory and Brown-Forman are undertaking hundred-million-dollar capital projects, while scores of new rickhouses -- the enormous warehouses used to age whiskey -- dot the rolling hills around Louisville.
But the changes are about more than money and investment. Americans aren't just buying more whiskey, and paying more for each bottle. They're buying into an entire "bourbon experience," from whiskey-themed boutique hotels in downtown Louisville to trendy restaurants with "curated" whiskey lists to fleets of tour buses carting bachelorette parties and corporate retreats from distillery to distillery.
"It's unbelievable," said Trey Zoeller, the founder of Jefferson's, a bourbon brand based in Louisville that just built a sprawling visitors center and has plans to quintuple the size of its distillery. "Truly, you build it and they will come."
The most ambitious people in the industry talk about the "Napa-fication" of bourbon, doing for American whiskey what Napa Valley did for American wine: not just make it in huge volumes, but elevate it to a world-class luxury status, built around a region and an image designed to generate billions of dollars in tourism, retail sales and investment. The sort of place where a $170 bottle of Kentucky Owl is actually a pretty good deal, and a far cry from the rural simplicity that bourbon was built on.
"This region has matured with the rise of the bourbon industry the way a stupid underage kid grows up to be a sophisticated adult," Mr. Dedman said. "I would never in my wildest dreams have imagined that we'd be where we are today."
'The wise man's bourbon'
Dixon Dedman is Kentucky royalty. His great-great-grandfather Charles Dedman founded one of the state's largest distilleries in the late 19th century, and his family has owned the award-winning, 31-room Beaumont Inn in Harrodsburg, Ky., for over a century. Tall, sandy-haired and soft-spoken at 37, Mr. Dedman exudes the image of a down-home goober -- his word -- that barely papers over a sharp, analytical mind.
"He plays dumb really well," said Mr. Minnick, "but he's really smart." (Disclosure: I've written for Mr. Minnick's magazine.)
There was never a question that Mr. Dedman would go into the family business. During college, in the early 2000s, he worked at the Beaumont Inn during the summer, and less than a week after graduation he was back washing dishes. Revenues were down, though, and major improvements were being pushed back for lack of money. The inn shut down for four months every winter for lack of visitors. With Mr. Dedman's father easing into retirement, it was suddenly up to him to save the family legacy.
Part of the problem was location. Even though it is in the middle of bourbon country, just east of Bardstown, Harrodsburg sits in a dry county -- which meant the inn couldn't cater to thirsty tourists visiting nearby distilleries.
"We'd get people coming through after seeing a distillery, and the strongest thing I could serve them in the restaurant was black coffee," Mr. Dedman said.
That changed in 2003, when the county voted to allow restaurants in Harrodsburg to sell liquor by the glass. Mr. Dedman pounced: He started selling drinks in the Beaumont's main dining room, and he opened two adjacent taverns, both of which became overnight successes in a town that was dying for a drink. (In 2015, the James Beard Foundation gave the inn an America's Classics award, which it bestows on distinguished regional restaurants.)
The decision to relax Harrodsburg's dry laws, and Mr. Dedman's push to sell liquor, came just as the bourbon industry was beginning to recover from a decades-long slump in consumer demand. In 1969 distillers produced 1.9 million barrels of whiskey, according to the Kentucky Distillers Association; in 1999, the industry's low point, it made just 455,000.
But in the mid-2000s, a younger generation of drinkers shifted back toward bourbon, drawn as much by its flavors as by its story as an authentic American craft. Like locally sourced food and artisanal furniture, bourbon appealed to consumers tired of flashy luxury and looking for simple, recognizable products. Between 2000 and 2010, revenues for American whiskey distilleries grew by 46 percent, according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, and tourists began pouring into Kentucky to see where all that whiskey was made.
That was especially good news for a place like the Beaumont Inn. Not only were locals flocking to its bars, but a mounting number of whiskey tourists, arriving to visit nearby distilleries like Four Roses and Maker's Mark, were lining up to stay in its guest rooms. By 2005, it was operating year-round.
Mr. Dedman had more on his mind than rescuing the Beaumont Inn. His great-great-grandfather's distillery, which opened on the banks of the Kentucky River in 1879, had grown rapidly, thanks to the success of its flagship whiskey, Kentucky Owl. Charles Dedman gave it the slogan "the wise man's bourbon."
The C.M. Dedman Distillery was forced to close during Prohibition, though, and it never reopened. Mr. Dedman's father and grandfather had often talked about restarting the brand, but it was idle chatter. In 2008, with the inn back to financial stability despite the looming recession, Mr. Dedman set out to realize their dream.
Instead of opening his own distillery -- a costly and time-intensive project -- Mr. Dedman decided to "source" whiskey distilled elsewhere, then bottle it under his own label. But sourcing decent whiskey presents its own challenges: Acquiring stocks of bourbon is largely a matter of knowing the right people to open the right doors. Fortunately, Mr. Dedman knew people: Generations of traveling whiskey businessmen had stayed at his family's hotel.
Among them was Jim Rutledge, the master distiller at Four Roses. Mr. Rutledge, who recently retired after 49 years with the distillery, is widely regarded as one of the greatest whiskey makers of his generation. Starting in 2010, Mr. Dedman would buy barrels of whiskey, then bring samples to Mr. Rutledge's home for him to assess.
Beating a $30,000 bottle of Scotch
Unfailingly polite but highly opinionated, Mr. Rutledge was not impressed. It turned out that even with access to good barrels, Mr. Dedman had something to learn about picking the right ones. "One day he had five samples, and we met over breakfast," Mr. Rutledge recalled. "I tried them and thought, 'How do I tell him not to ever put these in a bottle?' I told him he might have to blend them" -- a laborious process that involves taste-testing endless combinations of barrels.
Undeterred, that's what Mr. Dedman did. After closing up the inn at night, he would set up dozens of barrel samples at a table in the back of the restaurant and methodically mix them, paying close attention to their age, alcohol level, even where they had been sitting in the warehouse (temperature affects how a whiskey ages, and temperatures vary widely in an unheated warehouse).
It took nearly four years, but he finally settled on a blend he liked. He combined the barrels, paid someone to bottle and label them, and then took them around to local liquor distributors.
Mr. Dedman insists that making a commercially successful whiskey was never his plan. "It's not like I thought it out, like I said here's what I'll do year one, and then what I'll do year five," he said. "I never thought, we should do this because bourbon is on the move." Looking back, he cringes at how amateur the whole operation was -- he didn't have a sales plan, or a marketing strategy.
None of that mattered. By almost all accounts, that first batch of Kentucky Owl was a transcendently beautiful bourbon, reminiscent of whiskey made in the mid-20th century, often considered a golden age of distilling. "When you pick up that bottle, Kentucky Owl just feels like Kentucky," Mr. Minnick said. "And when you taste the early releases of Owl, it just tastes like old Kentucky bourbon from the 1950s."
Kentucky Owl got an added boost from social media. Rumors, spread through bourbon chat rooms on Reddit and other sites, claimed that Mr. Dedman had worked closely with Julian Van Winkle III, the owner of the legendary Old Rip Van Winkle whiskey company. The information was false, but it supercharged the hype.
"People just went nuts," Mr. Minnick said. "Kentucky Owl just has that cool factor you cannot teach."
Other whiskey brands have begun asking three-figure prices too: A rye whiskey from Kentucky Peerless, a new distillery in Louisville, goes for an average of $120. Chicken Cock, another sourced and "revived" 19th-century brand, sells for $250. Even once-proletarian brands like Wild Turkey and Four Roses now offer limited-edition expressions at $200 or more.
But none has quite matched Kentucky Owl for sheer consumer excitement. That first batch totaled just 1,400 bottles, and never made it out of the state. Subsequent batches were similarly limited, even as demand for the whiskey exploded. Accolades piled up: In late 2014, Garden & Gun magazine named it the best drink in its Made in the South awards, while this summer Whisky Advocate gave Mr. Dedman's first batch of rye whiskey 95 points, beating out a $30,000 bottle of Bowmore single-malt Scotch.
Whiskey fans and writers talk about Kentucky Owl as the next Pappy Van Winkle, Mr. Van Winkle's flagship brand, bottles of which often fetch $5,000 or more. Others, betting on Mr. Dedman's blending skills and the global growth of American whiskey, see it going even higher, to sit in the same category as the Macallan single malt or Château Latour Bordeaux.
"It has the potential to get up and stay among the world-class, luxury brands -- it has that kind of cachet," said Jeff Hopmayer, a strategic adviser in Nashville who has worked closely with several bourbon producers, including Kentucky Owl. "When I bring a bottle to a party, everyone freaks out."
Building a Napa Valley of whiskey
In early 2017, Mr. Dedman got a call from the office of Yuri Shefler, a Russian businessman. Mr. Shefler, who lives in London, is the sole owner of SPI Group, a global drinks company best known for Stolichnaya vodka, which Mr. Shefler acquired in 1999, two years after the Russian government sold it off.
Moscow, perhaps sensing that it had made a mistake in letting go of such a valuable brand, has sued to win Stolichnaya back. So far SPI Group has defended its most valuable property, but in recent years it has also diversified, buying or starting wineries in Spain and Argentina, a tequila distillery in Mexico and a rum distillery in Louisiana. Now, Mr. Shefler wanted a piece of the bourbon boom.
He wasn't alone. As American whiskey has demonstrated its staying power, it has attracted investors from around the world. In early 2017 Rémy Cointreau, the French drinks company, bought Westland, a craft distillery in Seattle; a few months later LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton bought the Woodinville Whiskey Company, in Woodinville, Wash. And in September 2018 Edrington, the owner of the Macallan single malt, bought a minority stake in Wyoming Whiskey, based near Jackson Hole.
But Mr. Shefler and SPI Group wanted more than just an investment in a bourbon company -- they wanted to control a chunk of the bourbon experience. Kentucky Owl offered a unique opportunity: a prestigious brand with almost no footprint, a blank slate on which SPI Group could write its own bourbon story.
Mr. Dedman and his partner, Mark Carter, closed the deal in early 2017, for an undisclosed sum. (Mr. Carter and his wife, Sherri, who own an inn and a winery in California, left the company; last year they introduced their own whiskey brand, Old Carter, at $250 a bottle.)
As part of the deal, Mr. Dedman is staying on as a corporate ambassador and blender for Kentucky Owl, which will remain the company's premier brand. Mr. Dedman's operation will sit within a much larger project, also called Kentucky Owl, which will generate a range of whiskeys at different prices, all produced at a sprawling facility in Bardstown.
That facility, Kentucky Owl Park, represents the full expression of where American whiskey is headed. Built on a 450-acre limestone quarry, the park will be about much more than making whiskey: A visitor might get a distillery tour in the morning, eat a lakeside lunch, see a live-music show in the afternoon and sleep in a boutique hotel room that night, all without leaving the property.
"It's about creating that overall experience," said Rudy Costello, the chief executive of Stoli Group USA, which oversees Mr. Shefler's American holdings. "We see the tourism in that area already, and I don't think we've even scratched the surface."
Right now, the site of the future Kentucky Owl Park is, literally, a hole in the ground; it takes some imagination to picture it as a nirvana of whiskey. But the plan also fits neatly within the overall trajectory of the Kentucky bourbon industry -- a half-dozen distilleries lie within a few minutes' drive, and all of them are building amenities like restaurants, visitors centers, parks and hotels to cater to a new class of whiskey tourist.
The typical distillery was once a utilitarian industrial plant; now it's a boozy theme park. The recently opened Castle and Key Distillery outside Frankfort, Ky., which took over a defunct distillery site modeled after a medieval castle, sports a botanical trail and a manicured garden. The centerpiece of the new Bardstown Bourbon Company distillery is Bottle & Bond, a minimalist-chic restaurant run by the former chef at the Greenbrier Resort in West Virginia. Upping the ante, SPI Group hired Shigeru Ban, a Pritzker Prize-winning architect, to design the main buildings at Kentucky Owl Park.
For local business leaders, such changes promise to turn the region into something like a Napa Valley of whiskey, a place that combines high-end retailing, resort hotels, fine dining and, flowing through it all, an unending river of tourist dollars.
"We don't want it to be just an industry; we want it to be a destination," said Kim Huston, the president of the Bardstown Industrial Development Corporation. Ms. Huston takes the Napa comparison seriously: She travels frequently to Northern California to study how its most famous wine region went from a sleepy agricultural community in the 1980s to being a synonym for high-end living.
"We're probably where they were 20 years ago," she said. "Our goal is for Bardstown to play on the world stage of luxury tourism."
Not everyone in the region is on board with these plans. Kentucky is significantly more traditional and rural than a place like Napa, and even deep-pocketed companies like Beam Suntory can't easily push around social conservatives who bristle at the thought of turning their towns over to tourists, no matter how much money the visitors bring in.
But the skeptics might not be able to hold out for long. Bourbon fans are already streaming into the state -- 1.2 million people visited its distilleries in 2017, a 20 percent jump from 2016 and almost double the number in 2014, according to the Kentucky Distillers Association.
And after years of speculation about a bourbon bubble, distilleries and investors are confident that the expansion is here to stay.
"If you look at the total amount of bourbon sales today, it's still less than it was in the 1970s, adjusted for inflation," said Mr. Costello, the Stoli Group USA chief executive. "And there is still tremendous opportunity outside the United States, with some big emerging markets starting to tune into American whiskey."
For Kentucky, the bourbon industry's rapid change in fortune -- and its transformative effects on the state economy -- is something many still find overwhelming, Mr. Dedman included.
For all his business savvy and financial success, he's still a guy who grew up thinking he'd spend his life running a small hotel in rural Kentucky. "I know what we're doing is going to have a big footprint and make us a major player," he said, sighing. "But it's something I can't get my head around."

Full text: Perhaps at no other time of the year is it clearer that elective self-denial is just another privilege of affluence. If you indulged in December without abatement, then you are likely to approach January with the intent to say no -- to cheese, to craft beer, to Shake Shack, to cake doughnuts, to the braised short ribs you have perfected in an Instant Pot. You will stay home and make salads and eat undressed grains, and presumably the money you save will be spent on virtuous things.
During these exercises in asceticism you may often feel hungry, but in most cases you will not think about hunger in any broader or meaningful sense. This is not (necessarily) because you are cold and indifferent to the misfortunes of others.
Hunger as a defining symptom of poverty in the United States is rarely discussed, either at the level of engaged civilian conversation or as a political talking point. To do so would be to admit to a failure of democracy for which too many are to blame.
According to government statistics, one in eight households in the United States is food insecure, meaning those households are unable to afford a consistent supply of nourishment throughout the year. In New York City, the number of people living with food insecurity has decreased during the past six years, but the figure is still higher -- by 22 percent -- than it was before the recession. In the Bronx, more than one-third of all children go hungry regularly.
On Jan. 1, the new minimum wage, set at $15 an hour, went into effect in New York City, and most companies employing more than 10 people have to pay it. The increase, considered a crucial step in the fight against poverty, is the result of a hard-fought grass-roots organizing effort begun seven years ago and championed as a great victory by liberal politicians, even those who were initially not liberal enough to embrace it. But how much will the new standard do to alleviate some of the most punishing aspects of the city's affordability crisis?
Last year, San Francisco and Seattle enacted a $15 minimum wage. Though both cities are also fantastically expensive, it is too soon to to draw any comparison to New York, which presents its own challenges. (What we do know from a study examining the experiment in Seattle is that as wages increased on the path to $15 an hour, experienced workers benefited most from higher pay at the expense of reduced opportunities for workers with less experience.)
Buried under the relentless flood of news during the last months of 2018 was a report, sponsored in part by City Harvest, New York's largest supplier of food to pantries and hunger charities that suggested less-than-optimistic predictions for what a new wage standard might achieve. The authors of the report calculated a self-sufficiency standard, meant to determine how much income is now required to meet basic needs -- housing, child care, food, transportation, health care -- without help from public subsidies, for families of different sizes living in different parts of the city.
The study found that more than two in five households in New York City lacked the income to cover necessities. And yet just a third of those households were considered poor by measures used by the federal government -- measures typically used as qualifiers for certain kinds of public assistance and ones that do not account for family composition among many other variables.
You begin to understand some of the animosity directed at Amazon around its impending move to Queens, for example, when you see how much money is actually required to live there already, before housing prices are destined to be driven up even further by the company's expansion. A single parent with two school-age children, for example would need to make nearly $69,427 a year, according to City Harvest's Self-Sufficiency calculator. That amounts to an hourly wage of just under $33.
So to live comfortably enough in all but the most expensive quarters in Brooklyn, a two-parent family with two children would need to make about $70,000 a year, which would mean that each parent would need to earn just over $16 an hour. That figure accounts for the $433 the family would receive in child-related tax credits. All across the city, the cost of basic needs is rising faster for low-income families that conventional inflation metrics actually indicate. Also dispiriting is the fact that nearly a quarter of households that fall below the self-sufficiency standard include an adult with a bachelor's degree.
What this tells us is that the arrival of a $15 hourly minimum wage cannot be considered the end of something. New York may be a city of self-invention, but it is not a city of self-sustenance. We are reminded of this every time we encounter the financial diary of a millennial -- a new publishing subcategory -- that breaks down expenses for rent and restaurants and Uber and so on and all too often reveals that a pair of parents in Greenwich, or Marin, or somewhere, is supplementing the meager salary of a fashion or media hopeful.
In many, many cases, a $15 hourly wage will not bring a family, or even a single person, to an adequate living standard. That hardly means the fight was worthless; it just means the war is ongoing.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text: A year ago, in the wake of President Trump's tax cut, euphoric investors pushed the Dow Jones industrial average past 25,000, a record. The Dow had just gained 25 percent in 2017, and the Nasdaq had leapt 28 percent. Volatility was so low that there wasn't a single day in 2017 when the S&P 500 fluctuated more than 2 percent.
Not everyone was celebrating.
"If there are any certainties, one will be that this party will eventually come to an end," James Stack, president of InvesTech Research, told me a year ago. "And when it ends, it will end badly, and with high volatility."
Mr. Stack turned out to be right. He lowered his recommended asset allocation for United States stocks from 82 percent last January to 72 percent in September, when stocks hit new all-time highs. He urged investors to raise cash in October, and at the end of November he recommended an even more defensive posture -- including putting money in a fund whose value would rise when stock prices dropped. That brought his recommended net exposure to stocks to just 55 percent, the lowest since the depths of the last bear market in early 2009.
Stocks plunged in December, posting their worst monthly loss since the financial crisis and the worst December since 1931 and the Great Depression.
Yet most economic indicators are benign. Unemployment is an exceptionally low 3.7 percent. Wages are rising. Inflation remains below the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target. The Fed raised rates a quarter point in December, citing "a very healthy economy."
Given Mr. Stack's track record last year, I reached out to him this week for his current views. Even though valuations have come down and macroeconomic indicators "have remained remarkably strong," he said, he's still defensive and hasn't changed his bearish allocation. He believes that the worst isn't over and that the Dow and S&P 500 will soon be down 20 percent from their peaks, retreating into a bear market. (The Nasdaq Composite and the Wilshire 2000 index of small-cap stocks are already there.)
And that was before a revenue warning from Apple sent markets into another steep fall on Thursday.
"A lesson from history is that the market leads the economy by a lot longer than investors realize," Mr. Stack said. If the economy is headed toward recession, as the latest stock market declines suggest it may be, "we won't see the first economic warning signs until the first three to five months" of 2019. Among the leading indicators he's watching for signs of weakness are consumer confidence, housing starts and unemployment claims.
On Thursday, the Institute for Supply Management manufacturing index, a leading indicator of industrial activity, fell sharply. That suggests that "serious cracks" are starting to appear in the economy, Mr. Stack said.
Mr. Stack is right that bear markets typically precede recessions by many months: CNBC calculated in 2016 that bear markets since World War II had begun on average about eight months before a recession. That means that if a bear market did begin after major indexes peaked last fall, a recession might not start until June or even later. Even then, recessions are often over before economic data confirms their existence.
That's when bear markets are, in fact, followed by recessions, which often isn't the case. As the economist Paul Samuelson famously said, "The stock market has forecast nine of the last five recessions."
Since World War II, there have been 13 bear markets. They were followed within a year by a recession just seven times. As a predictor of recessions with just 54 percent accuracy, bear markets are little better than flipping a coin.
Indeed, Mr. Stack's data show that two or more down years in a row are quite rare: There have been only four instances since 1928, suggesting that stocks may well be in positive territory by the end of 2019, even if a bear market does materialize in the meantime.
Which is one reason the Wharton economist Jeremy Siegel told me that he's bullish on the stock market this year. He predicts it could rise between 5 percent and 15 percent, even if there is an economic slowdown.
Stocks are much cheaper now than they were before the December sell-off. The ratio between stock prices and projected earnings for companies in the S&P 500 is about 17, down from over 19 a year ago and the lowest in the past five years.
[Stocks rose Friday after the release of a strong December jobs report and comments by the chairman of the Federal Reserve that the central bank would be flexible on raising interest rates this year.]
Mr. Stack, however, argued that in the event of an economic downturn -- or even a significant slowdown -- "those projected earnings will go out the window."
"I would not call today's market undervalued," he added.
Mr. Siegel bases his forecast of a market rally on the belief that the Fed will stop raising short-term interest rates. "I think the Fed got the message from the markets that it should not have hiked in December," he said.
Mr. Stack, too, said he was surprised the Fed raised rates in December. "I think the Fed will stand down and put future rate increases on hold," he said, "which could stabilize the market, at least for the time being."
But Mr. Stack's technical indicators are still pointing toward a bear market. He's also worried about the shaky housing market, with price drops and slowing sales showing up in major cities.
"We're not trying to time the market, but we're very comfortable with our defensive allocation," he said. Although he predicted higher volatility a year ago, he was nonetheless surprised by the extremes reached in December, without even "a single hard warning sign of recession on the horizon."
"Can you imagine," he asked, "how volatile it will be when we do have those warnings?"

Full text: ATLANTA -- It was only 16 days ago when the Federal Reserve raised interest rates and its chairman, Jerome Powell, conveyed that he was fundamentally confident about the outlook for the United States economy.
To markets, he came across as excessively dismissive of the message that turbulent stock, bond and commodity prices were sending. His comments were interpreted as implying the Fed was dead-set on pushing interest rates higher to prevent some hypothetical future inflation, consequences be damned.
It's clear that a jaw-dropping series of market swings, combined with some hints that a broader economic slowdown could be on the way, have made Mr. Powell rethink things.
Two weeks ago, the consensus of Mr. Powell's Fed colleagues was that two more interest rate increases were likely this year. In his message Friday, in a panel I moderated at the American Economic Association, he decidedly did not reaffirm that projection. Instead, his emphasis was on flexibility, adaptability and open-mindedness.
The markets seemed to love it -- and why wouldn't they? Mr. Powell's appearance essentially repaired the damage from his indifferent tone of two weeks ago.
The market response Friday -- the S&P 500 rose quickly and closed up 3.4 percent -- seemed to be to his opening comments, which Mr. Powell read from notes. They were deliberate and precise words, not off-the-cuff remarks. Sometimes, markets overreact to extemporaneous remarks a Fed chief makes in a news conference or in a congressional hearing; this was not one of those cases.
It also helped that the dovish message arrived less than two hours after an employment report that showed exceptionally strong job growth in December.
For certain monetary policy traditionalists, the robust wage growth in that report -- up 3.2 percent over the past year -- could point to inflation worries. But in the panel, Mr. Powell made a point of saying the wage growth number did not alarm him and should not be taken as a signal that prices were set to spiral out of control.
It is a safe bet that the Fed will not be raising rates in the early months of 2019, and will resume its tightening campaign only once the global outlook is clearer, or once a more substantial inflation risk appears in the United States.
It's particularly clear that the lessons of history loom large in Mr. Powell's thinking. In 2015 and early 2016, when he was a Fed governor and Janet Yellen was chairwoman, an eerily similar episode dragged down U.S. economic growth so much that it can be thought of as a mini-recession.
In that episode, the Fed's push to raise interest rates helped fuel a vicious cycle of slower growth overseas, falling commodity prices, a stronger dollar and lower inflation.
There are differences this time around -- in particular, a trade war with China is a big factor in the slowdown in Chinese growth. Another difference is that the United States economy is stronger now, with an unemployment rate below 4 percent for six straight months, making the overheating risk in the United States higher.
But the similarity comes in the ways that actions taken by Fed officials in Washington can ripple around the globe and come back to bite the United States economy in unpredictable ways.
The fact that Mr. Powell brought up the episode from 2015 and early 2016 -- in the prepared portion of his comments, and in response to an open-ended question about the economy -- is a sign that he thinks it is relevant to current policy.
Will 2019 be as hard a year for the economy as financial markets seem to be bracing for? The economic data is still quite strong, none more so than the latest job numbers. But, as Mr. Powell said, those are backward-looking indicators, and the Fed must make policy by looking forward.
The loud-and-clear message is that Mr. Powell and his colleagues aren't going to put their hands over their ears, ignore these messages from markets, and carry on as planned.
And that, in turn, seems to make some of the darker possibilities for 2019 a lot less likely.

Full text: A year ago, in the wake of President Trump's tax cut, euphoric investors pushed the Dow Jones industrial average past 25,000, a record. The Dow had just gained 25 percent in 2017, and the Nasdaq had leapt 28 percent. Volatility was so low that there wasn't a single day in 2017 when the S&P 500 fluctuated more than 2 percent.
Not everyone was celebrating.
"If there are any certainties, one will be that this party will eventually come to an end," James Stack, president of InvesTech Research, told me a year ago. "And when it ends, it will end badly, and with high volatility."
Mr. Stack turned out to be right. He lowered his recommended asset allocation for United States stocks from 82 percent last January to 72 percent in September, when stocks hit new all-time highs. He urged investors to raise cash in October, and at the end of November he recommended an even more defensive posture -- including putting money in a fund whose value would rise when stock prices dropped. That brought his recommended net exposure to stocks to just 55 percent, the lowest since the depths of the last bear market in early 2009.
Stocks plunged in December, posting their worst monthly loss since the financial crisis and the worst December since 1931 and the Great Depression.
Yet most economic indicators are benign. Unemployment is an exceptionally low 3.7 percent. Wages are rising. Inflation remains below the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target. The Fed raised rates a quarter point in December, citing "a very healthy economy."
Given Mr. Stack's track record last year, I reached out to him this week for his current views. Even though valuations have come down and macroeconomic indicators "have remained remarkably strong," he said, he's still defensive and hasn't changed his bearish allocation. He believes that the worst isn't over and that the Dow and S&P 500 will soon be down 20 percent from their peaks, retreating into a bear market. (The Nasdaq Composite and the Wilshire 2000 index of small-cap stocks are already there.)
And that was before a revenue warning from Apple sent markets into another steep fall on Thursday.
"A lesson from history is that the market leads the economy by a lot longer than investors realize," Mr. Stack said. If the economy is headed toward recession, as the latest stock market declines suggest it may be, "we won't see the first economic warning signs until the first three to five months" of 2019. Among the leading indicators he's watching for signs of weakness are consumer confidence, housing starts and unemployment claims.

Full text: Thirteen nations announced on Friday that they would not recognize the legitimacy of the new presidential term of Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela, who is set to be inaugurated next week for a second time.
Diplomats from Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras, Panama, Paraguay, Peru and St. Lucia issued a joint statement after meeting in the Peruvian capital, denouncing last year's election as flawed and urging Mr. Maduro to hand power to the opposition-controlled National Assembly until another election could be held.
"The electoral process carried out in Venezuela on May 20, 2018, lacks legitimacy due to the lack of participation of all Venezuelan political actors, without the presence of independent international observers, or the guarantees and standards necessary for a free, fair and transparent process," the statement read.
The signatories, part of the so-called Lima Group -- a multilateral working group of Latin American countries plus Canada that organized to find a peaceful solution to the crisis in Venezuela -- urged Mr. Maduro not to assume the office, saying that the only way to restore democracy was for him to step aside.
Mr. Maduro's second term is set to begin next Thursday, but his re-election has been widely criticized as his country has fallen into political, economic and humanitarian crisis.
Political oppression, human rights abuses, high inflation and shortages of food and medicine have prompted millions to migrate, many to neighboring countries. In September, some of those neighbors urged the International Criminal Court to consider prosecuting senior officials in Venezuela.
The Lima Group on Friday also denounced the breakdown of the rule of law in Venezuela, saying that "only through the full restoration, as soon as possible, of democracy and respect for human rights" could the country recover.
While the United States is not part of the Lima Group, the State Department said Secretary of State Mike Pompeo participated in Friday's meeting by video conference.
Earlier this week, Mr. Pompeo toured Latin America, meeting with allied nations and discussing the situation in Venezuela.
On Tuesday, he met with the foreign minister of Peru to discuss putting pressure on Mr. Maduro "to return democracy and prosperity to the Venezuelan people," according to a spokesman for the State Department.
The next day, after Mr. Pompeo met with Brazil's foreign minister, the State Department issued a similar note saying the two talked about working together on challenges in the region, "including supporting the people of Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua in restoring their democratic governance and their human rights."
Mr. Pompeo also met with President Iván Duque of Colombia to discuss intervention in Venezuela. Venezuela's Ministry of Foreign Affairs denounced that meeting and said both countries "seek to subjugate and violate the sovereignty and self-determination of the Venezuelan people."
Venezuela's government has long opposed what it sees as American interference in its affairs, particularly after President Trump's administration scaled up sanctions on critical officials and held secret meetings with rebellious military officers to discuss their plans to overthrow Mr. Maduro.
Jorge Arreaza, Venezuela's foreign minister, posted a vitriolic response on Twitter to reports that Mr. Pompeo had participated in the Lima Group meeting, saying that those involved were taking their orders from Mr. Trump.
He wrote: "What we have been affirming since the creation of this group of cartelized governments against Venezuela, which in theory does not belong to the US government: they meet to receive orders from @realDonaldTrump through @SecPompeo. What a display of humiliating subordination!"

Promise From Powell, Mixed With Defiance: 'We Will Be Patient'

Full text: ATLANTA -- Jerome H. Powell, the Federal Reserve chairman, said Friday that low inflation would allow the Fed to be "patient" in deciding whether to continue raising interest rates, a message welcomed by jittery investors.
The Fed is confronting an increasingly uncertain economic outlook. Falling stock prices, weakening global growth and concerns about President Trump's economic policies have set investors on edge and prompted warnings that the economic expansion is nearing its end. But measures of domestic economic activity remain strong, including Friday's report the economy added 312,000 jobs in December.
Mr. Powell's message on Friday was that the Fed can afford to watch and wait. He said the best available evidence suggested that the economy was still in good shape. But he also was at pains to reassure investors unsettled by his confident tone at his last news conference, in mid-December. He said that the Fed was watching for evidence of weakness, and that the health of the economy would ultimately determine the course of policy.
"With the muted inflation readings that we've seen coming in, we will be patient as we watch to see how the economy evolves," Mr. Powell said. The Fed predicted in December that it would raise rates twice in 2019, but Mr. Powell said the central bank was ready to change course "significantly if necessary."
The stock market, driven down on Thursday by concerns about growth, surged on Friday on the strength of the jobs data, and then kept climbing as Mr. Powell spoke. Investors who are worried about the growing economic impact of a trade war with China also hoped for progress toward a resolution when the Trump administration and Chinese officials hold meetings next week.
The S&P 500 rose 84.05 points to close at 2,531.94; the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury rose 0.11 points to close at 2.668 percent.
[Read more: The jobs data, and signs of flexibility at the Fed, helped stocks soar on Friday.]
Mr. Powell also defended the Fed's autonomy on Friday in the face of sharp attacks by Mr. Trump, who has complained to aides that the Fed's rate increases would undermine economic growth and "turn me into Hoover," a reference to the president during the Great Depression's early years.
Some of Mr. Trump's economic advisers, alarmed by his inquiries as to whether he has the power to fire Mr. Powell, want to arrange a meeting between the two men. Mr. Powell, under questioning by Neil Irwin, an economics writer at The New York Times, said that he was open to meeting with Mr. Trump, as Fed chairs have done with past presidents, but that no meeting had been scheduled.
He also said the Fed would make policy without regard to Mr. Trump's views. "I want the public to be assured that we have a strong culture, it's not a fragile one, it's not being disrupted," he said.
Asked if he would resign if Mr. Trump asked him to do so, Mr. Powell replied directly: "No."
Mr. Powell was joined onstage at the annual meeting of the American Economic Association by his immediate predecessors at the Fed, Janet L. Yellen and Ben S. Bernanke. Both of them criticized Mr. Trump's attacks as potentially damaging to the central bank, and therefore to the economy.
Strong economic growth fueled the Fed's decision to raise its benchmark rate four times in 2018, into a range from 2.25 percent to 2.5 percent. The rate, which had hovered near zero in the wake of the financial crisis a decade earlier, now sits at the lower end of the range that Fed officials consider a reasonable estimate of "neutrality," meaning that the central bank is neither encouraging nor discouraging economic growth.

Fed officials say the continued strength of the economy validates their management of monetary policy. "I think we're actually in a good spot," Loretta Mester, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, told CNBC on Friday, noting that job growth is strong and inflation is under control.
But critics, including Mr. Trump, have said the economy still needs the Fed's help. Inflation remains below the 2 percent annual pace the Fed regards as optimal, suggesting that the economy has room to grow, and workers are only beginning to reap the benefits of an expansion now in its 10th year.
Clouds also are gathering on the economic horizon. The Trump administration increased economic growth last year through large tax cuts and increased federal spending, but those benefits are waning. And Mr. Trump's trade war with China is beginning to be felt by American companies, like Apple and FedEx, which have warned that the tit-for-tat tariffs are pinching profits.
The Fed's decision to raise the benchmark rate at its most recent meeting, in mid-December, drove down stock prices and bond yields in a show of concern about the prospects for continued economic growth. Asset prices imply an expectation that the Fed will not raise interest rates at all during 2019.

Mr. Powell began his remarks by reiterating his view that the markets' concerns are overstated. He said that 2018 had been "a good year for the United States economy" and that the latest economic data suggested "ongoing momentum heading into 2019." Wall Street's pessimism, he said, is "well ahead of the data."
But the Fed chairman offered a different kind of relief to financial markets by emphasizing that the slow pace of inflation allows the Fed to postpone judgments about the resilience of the economic expansion.
Inflation was 1.8 percent during the 12 months that ended in November, the most recent available data. It is likely that inflation remained soft in December, marking the seventh straight year that prices rose by less than 2 percent.
And inflation would have been even weaker but for the impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs, according to a study published Friday by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Mr. Trump has repeatedly argued that the cost of the tariffs, which are taxes on imported goods, is being absorbed by Chinese exporters. But the study found that American consumers were paying a hefty price. The authors estimated that the tariffs added about 0.3 percentage points to the Consumer Price Index last year.
Job growth has remained strong, and wage growth has increased in recent months, but Mr. Powell said the Fed was on guard against rising prices, not rising wages. He said the strength of the labor market "does not raise concerns about too high inflation."
Michael Feroli, chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase, said Mr. Powell's remarks convinced him that the Fed would move more slowly in 2019. Mr. Feroli previously predicted three rate increases in 2019; he said he now expected the Fed to raise rates twice, in July and December.
"Powell's message was unmistakable," Mr. Feroli wrote in a note to clients.
Mr. Powell also sought to ease concerns in financial markets about the Fed's gradual reduction of its holdings of Treasuries and mortgage bonds, which it bought in large quantities during the financial crisis to help bolster the economy. Some analysts have argued that the Fed's retreat is exacerbating the current volatility in financial markets.
Mr. Powell said that the Fed disagreed but, returning to his theme for the day, that it was watching closely and willing to change its mind.
"If we ever came to the conclusion that any aspect of our plans was somehow interfering with our attainment of our statutory goals, we wouldn't hesitate to change it," he said.

Full text: On Thursday, the best House speaker of modern times reclaimed her gavel, replacing one of the worst. It has taken the news media a very long time to appreciate the greatness of Nancy Pelosi, who saved Social Security from privatization, then was instrumental in gaining health insurance for 20 million Americans. And the media are still having a hard time facing up to the phoniness of their darling Paul Ryan, who, by the way, left office with a 12 percent favorable rating. But I think the narrative is finally, grudgingly, catching up with reality.
There's every reason to expect that Pelosi will once again be highly effective. But some progressive Democrats object to one of her initial moves -- and on the economics, and probably the politics, the critics are right.
The issue in question is "paygo," a rule requiring that increases in spending be matched by offsetting tax increases or cuts elsewhere.
You can argue that as a practical matter, the rule won't matter much if at all. On one side, paygo is the law, whether Democrats put it in their internal rules or not. On the other side, the law can fairly easily be waived, as happened after the G.O.P.'s huge 2017 tax cut was enacted.
But adopting the rule was a signal of Democratic priorities -- a statement that the party is deeply concerned about budget deficits and willing to cramp its other goals to address that concern. Is that a signal the party should really be sending?
The economics of crude, mechanical rules about budget deficits are clear: They're a really bad idea.
Deficit obsession was deeply destructive in the years that followed the global financial crisis, helping conservatives push for austerity measures that held back economic recovery for years. True, we no longer have a depressed economy, and austerity is a lot less destructive when the unemployment rate is less than 4 percent than it is when unemployment is more than 8 percent. But another recession will come, sooner or later -- probably sooner rather than later -- and a rigid budget rule will not be helpful when it does.
Furthermore, there are things the government should be spending money on even when jobs are plentiful -- things like fixing our deteriorating infrastructure and helping children get education, health care and adequate nutrition. Such spending has big long-run payoffs, even in purely monetary terms.
Meanwhile, the federal government can borrow money very cheaply -- the interest rate on inflation-protected 10-year bonds is only about 1 percent. These low borrowing costs, in turn, reflect what seems to be a persistent savings glut -- that is, the private sector wants to save more than it's willing to invest, even with very low interest rates.
Given this reality, why not put some of those excess savings to work in high-return public investments? Should we really refuse to spend money repairing sewer systems or providing child nutrition if doing so raises the deficit a bit, with only a minor impact on future interest costs?
But, you may say, isn't it politically important for Democrats to present themselves as the party of fiscal responsibility? I'm highly skeptical.
Consider budget history over the past generation. The story is very clear: When in power, Democrats make big efforts to balance the budget; when Republicans come in, they promptly blow the money on tax cuts for the wealthy. Yet polling consistently shows the G.O.P. with an edge on the question of which party is better at dealing with deficits.
Or consider what happened after Democrats enacted the Affordable Care Act, going to great lengths to pay for the additional benefits with tax increases and spending cuts. A majority of voters still believed that it increased the deficit. Reality doesn't seem to matter.
Anyway, the truth is that while voters may claim to care about the deficit, hardly any of them really do. For example, does anyone still believe that the Tea Party uprising was a protest against deficits? From the beginning, it was basically about race -- about the government spending money to help Those People. And that's true of a lot of what pretends to be fiscal conservatism.
In fact, even the deficit scolds who played such a big role in Beltway discourse during the Obama years seem oddly selective in their concerns about red ink. After all those proclamations that fiscal doom was coming any day now unless we cut spending on Social Security and Medicare, it's remarkable how muted their response has been to a huge, budget-busting tax cut. It's almost as if their real goal was shrinking social programs, not limiting national debt.
So am I saying that Democrats should completely ignore budget deficits? No; if and when they're ready to move on things like some form of Medicare for All, the sums will be so large that asking how they'll be paid for will be crucial.
But while fiscal prudence is always necessary, for Democrats to put spending in a straitjacket -- especially when Republicans have shown themselves completely irresponsible -- looks like a bad move.

Turmoil in Turkey, But Steel Executive Is Standing Firm

Full text: ISTANBUL -- In a prominent spot on a shelf close to his desk, Fuat Tosyali keeps a reminder of what his life was like long before he became a steel magnate and one of the richest people in Turkey, with a penthouse office outside Istanbul and a Mercedes limousine parked out front.
It is a black and white photograph of a young man polishing a stovepipe.
The young man is Mr. Tosyali, and in many ways the photograph tells the story of how far the Turkish economy has come. Mr. Tosyali's road from poverty to wealth mirrors Turkey's journey from tattered former empire to Mediterranean powerhouse with growth rates to rival China, at least until the economy took a steep dive last summer.
In an interview in his office, which is furnished with ample couches covered in beige leather and a polished black coffee table the size of a double bed, Mr. Tosyali professed confidence despite a downturn that has been exacerbated by the punitive tariffs imposed on Turkish steel by the United States.
"This is my 51st year in the business," said Mr. Tosyali, 55, who began helping out his father's metalworking shop before he was old enough to go to school. "I have seen many crises."
"The economic turbulence is temporary," he said in a follow-up telephone interview. "As a company, we are aware of our strength. We know our country's economic strength, too."
Mr. Tosyali's bravado may sound odd given the events of the past year, when he and other Turkish business executives have been forced to cope with a plunge in the value of the lira, a sharp decline in consumer demand, and President Trump's 50 percent levies on steel imported from Turkey -- twice the size of tariffs imposed on Europe and other American allies.
The problems have put Turkey, which has the world's 17th-largest economy, high on the list of places where the next global financial crisis could start.
Many of Mr. Tosyali's peers are becoming more pessimistic. In growing numbers, Turkish entrepreneurs are leaving the country or transferring their wealth overseas because they fear that the country's economy could get much worse, or that their assets and freedoms could be seized by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's authoritarian government.
Not Mr. Tosyali. He said he planned a major new investment in steel production, although he declined to give details. "It is unforgivable to hide the money you made in Turkey by taking it abroad," he said.
Until recently at least, Turkey has been viewed as an economic success story, despite episodes of harrowing financial and political turmoil. Since the beginning of this century, poverty has fallen by half. The average resident of the country lives a quarter-century longer than his counterpart in the 1960s. The economy has grown more than a third since the 2008 financial crisis. In 2017 growth was more than 7 percent, putting Turkey on the cusp of becoming what the World Bank classifies as a "high income."
Entrepreneurs like Mr. Tosyali have benefited from the growth and helped generate the jobs and investment that kept it going.
The company now known as Tosyali Holding began in the Mediterranean port city of Iskenderun, near the border with Syria. The family metalworking shop was so tiny, Mr. Tosyali said, that it would take up only a corner of the office he occupies today in a neighborhood outside central Istanbul where the hills are dotted with new luxury apartment complexes.
Mr. Tosyali said that his father, Serif Tosyali, was illiterate and deeply ashamed of it. But he understood numbers and could gauge a piece of steel's thickness to a fraction of a millimeter just by holding it between his fingers.
When Fuat Tosyali was not in school -- his father insisted his children get an education -- he and his younger brothers Ayhan and Fatih helped hammer scrap metal into parts for stoves and boilers. Later, the family began producing enameled steel for the washing machines that more and more Turks could afford, and pipes for homes that increasingly had modern heat.
In 1994, the Tosyalis bought a factory in Iskenderun that produced iron used in construction. The acquisition positioned them to profit from a sustained building boom, started a steel-making empire that now includes 18 factories in Algeria, Montenegro and Turkey and helped transform the family's business into Turkey's biggest producer of steel pipes.
Mr. Tosyali attributes the success to hard work. He received a reporter on a Saturday morning and said he planned to spend the rest of the weekend visiting factories.
"We are working nonstop seven days, 24 hours," he said. "Not only me, all of my family."
After one of the country's most difficult years in two decades, it is unclear how the current chapter in the story of Turkey's rise will end. Will it fall victim to economic mismanagement by Mr. Erdogan's increasingly repressive government? Or will Turkish entrepreneurs like Mr. Tosyali once again demonstrate their instinct for survival?
Most economists expect things to get worse before they get better. "Everyone is anticipating a recession," said Güven Sak, who leads the Economic Policy Research Foundation, a think tank based in Ankara.
There are a few hopeful signs. The lira, which was in danger of falling below 7 to the dollar in August, has recovered somewhat and was trading at about 5.30 to the dollar on Monday. Still, the Turkish currency lost 28 percent of its value in 2018.
In another positive development, inflation is retreating from the astronomical levels it had reached. The annual rate, which had climbed above 25 percent, fell below 22 percent in November after the Turkish central bank raised its benchmark interest rate to 24 percent.
The lira's decline is not all bad for steel makers. They earn revenue from exports in dollars but must pay many of their bills in devalued liras. That gives manufacturers a potential advantage in export markets, although those benefits are partly canceled out by the higher prices they must pay for imported raw materials.
But the drop is dangerous for Turkey's financial system. It is also a source of anxiety in Europe, where analysts and bank regulators fear that loans to Turkish businesses might not be repaid, which could destabilize banks like UniCredit of Italy that have significant holdings there.
In many cases Turkish banks have issued loans to businesses that must be repaid with dollars or euros. Banks are already reporting increases in troubled loans because companies that do not rely on exports and earn revenue in liras are having trouble servicing these foreign currency debts.
The Turkish economy began slowing markedly around the middle of 2018 in reaction to the financial stress. Economic output is expected to shrink 0.4 percent in 2019, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
Mr. Erdogan is not making things any easier. He has driven some business owners into exile for allegedly plotting with his opponents. Akin Ipek, another of Turkey's richest men, had holdings in mining and media before the government seized his conglomerate in 2015 while he was visiting London. Mr. Erdogan has also criticized the Turkish central bank for raising interest rates, a step that most economists considered the only way to corral inflation.
The government has responded with temporary measures like tax incentives for people who buy furniture, large appliances, cars and homes.
"Some precautions are being taken for industry," said Mr. Sak of the Economic Policy Research Foundation. "But these are Band-Aids, not the remedy."
Mr. Trump's policies are also weighing on the Turkish economy. In August, he set the tariff on steel imported from the company at 50 percent after Turkey detained Andrew Brunson, an American pastor. But the tariffs were kept in place even after a Turkish court freed Mr. Brunson in October.
"There was no explicit quid pro quo for the arrangements with the pastor," Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, told reporters in October. The statement seemed to contradict a message Mr. Trump had posted on Twitter in August, when he linked the tariffs to bad relations with Turkey.
Like many Turkish business leaders, Mr. Tosyali is reluctant to discuss politics.
"We truly respect the United States," he said. "Of course we would like to be there. If they don't want to buy our products we will respect that."
Mr. Tosyali noted that while Tosyali Holding may not be able to sell products to customers in the United States, it is buying from American companies. In 2017, the company formed a joint venture with Harsco Corporation in Pennsylvania to recycle scrap metal and waste products in Turkish factories.
As Mr. Tosyali sees it, the rough period now facing Turkey is another opportunity for entrepreneurs to demonstrate their fortitude. Tosyali Holding, he said, planned to take advantage of lower manufacturing costs to expand and put itself in position to gain market share when the crisis is over.
Other bosses "put their feet on the brakes, they cut the work force," Mr. Tosyali said. "We do the opposite."

Full text: President Trump has a well-documented problem telling the truth.
Fact checkers have compiled lists of all of Mr. Trump's falsehoods since he took office (The Washington Post counts over 7,500, and The Toronto Star over 3,900), rounded up his most egregious whoppers in year-end lists and scrutinized his claims in real time with television chyrons.
Here at The New York Times, we have also fact-checked countless campaign rallies, news conferences, interviews and Twitter posts. After nearly two years of assessing the accuracy of Mr. Trump's statements, we can draw some conclusions not just about the scale of the president's mendacity, but also about how he uses inaccurate claims to advance his agenda, criticize the news media and celebrate his achievements.
Repetition and Inflation
Mr. Trump refuses to correct most of his inaccurate claims, instead asserting them over and over again. They become, by sheer force of repetition, "alternative facts" and staples of his campaign rallies and speeches.
Examples abound. He has falsely characterized the December 2017 tax cuts as the "largest" or the "biggest" in American history over 100 times (several others were larger). He has misleadingly said over 90 times that his promised wall along the southern border is being built (construction has not begun on any new section). He has falsely accused Democrats of supporting "open borders" over 60 times (Democratic lawmakers support border security, but not his border wall). And he has lobbed over 250 inaccurate attacks on the investigation into Russian election interference.
Yet Mr. Trump does not rely on repetition alone. He also embellishes talking points to amplify his achievements.
Take his repeated fabrication about the construction of new steel mills. After his administration announced tariffs on steel and aluminum imports in March, the president claimed in June that United States Steel was "opening six new plants." A month later, the number rose to seven. He has also occasionally cited eight, possibly nine or a vague "many plants," and he claimed once that plants were "opening up literally on a daily basis." To date, United States Steel has yet to open or build one new plant, though the company has restarted idled components of some plants.
Mr. Trump often pairs his misleading claim that his border wall is being built with the statement that he received $1.6 billion from Congress to fund it -- though a spending bill from March stipulated that the money, for border security, could not be used for the wall. In August, he added another $1.6 billion to the count, with no evidence. And despite criticizing a spending bill passed in September for not appropriating any money for the wall, Mr. Trump told campaign rally audiences in Illinois, Texas and Mississippi in October that his administration had secured a "third $1.6 billion."
In some cases, true claims morph into false ones in Mr. Trump's telling. In December 2017, he was largely accurate in saying a military spending law would give troops the largest raise in eight years. In March, he then exaggerated that time frame to "over a decade." And in May, as he addressed Naval Academy graduates at Annapolis, Mr. Trump wrongly characterized the wage increase as not just the largest, but the "first in 10 years."
Shifting and Deflecting
In the face of controversy or criticism, Mr. Trump has defended initial falsehoods with additional dubious claims.
This approach is evident in his shifting statements about the payment that Michael D. Cohen, his former lawyer, made to a pornographic film actress to keep her from speaking about their alleged affair. In April, Mr. Trump falsely denied knowing about the payment.
After the F.B.I. raided Mr. Cohen's office, Mr. Trump acknowledged on Twitter in May that Mr. Cohen received reimbursement for the payment and asserted that it had nothing to do with his presidential campaign. Mr. Cohen would later tell prosecutors that he acted at Mr. Trump's direction and to influence the election.
After the release of an audio recording of the two men discussing a hush-money payment to another woman, Mr. Trump claimed in an August interview on "Fox & Friends" that he did not know about the payments until "later on" and that Mr. Cohen "made the deals." He then misleadingly compared Mr. Cohen's actions -- a willful violation of campaign finance law -- to a civil infraction incurred by former President Barack Obama's 2008 campaign.
By December, Mr. Trump's defense had shifted further: "I never directed Michael Cohen to break the law."
Misleading Vagueness and Fanciful Details
The president is known for being unscripted and loose with language, but he sometimes shows tactical restraint.
After Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh was confirmed to the Supreme Court and in the days before the midterm elections, Mr. Trump told rallygoers in Missouri that "the accuser admitted she never met him, she never saw him, he never touched her, talked to her, he had nothing to do with her, she made up the story, it was false accusations."
The omission of a name and the use of the words "the accuser" may give the misleading impression that Christine Blasey Ford, who testified to Congress that Justice Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her when they were teenagers, had recanted her account. But in fact, Mr. Trump was referring to another little-known accuser named Judy Munro-Leighton, who recanted her claim of sexual assault.
Mr. Trump also regales his audience with elaborate stories. Some -- like his tales of unnamed "strong" or "tough" men, miners or steelworkers crying and thanking him -- may have occurred but are impossible to verify.
Others, like his frequent attacks on Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, contain invented details. Not content with just accurately pointing out that Mr. Blumenthal falsely claimed to have served in Vietnam, Mr. Trump adds -- with no evidence -- that Mr. Blumenthal said he had "charged up Da Nang," dodged bullets and saved the lives of fellow soldiers.
Inventing Straw Men
The usual target of this particular strain of falsehoods is the news media, which Mr. Trump suggests purposely underestimates or misinterprets him.
Mr. Trump often lauds strong job growth under his watch and says that the "fake news" would have deemed such numbers "impossible" or "ridiculous" during the 2016 campaign. Yet he neglects to mention that the number of jobs added in the 22 months after his inauguration -- 4.2 million -- is lower than the 4.8 million jobs added in the 22 months before he took office, undermining the premise of his retrodiction.
In another example, Mr. Trump turned a hypothetical talking point first into a purported reality and then -- after headlines debunking his claim appeared -- into a joke that he implied reporters had failed to grasp.
At an October rally in Arizona, Mr. Trump criticized Democrats for allowing undocumented immigrants to apply for driver's licenses. "Next thing you know, they'll want to buy 'em a car," he speculated. "Then they'll say the car's not good enough, we want -- how about a Rolls-Royce?"
A day later, at a campaign rally in Nevada, Mr. Trump presented this theory as reality, telling supporters that Democrats wanted to give cars and licenses to undocumented immigrants in addition to free health care and education.
After the claim was debunked by news outlets, Mr. Trump responded by ridiculing the news media for mentioning the Rolls-Royce, which was not the actual subject of the fact checks.
"They said he gets a Pinocchio for that," Mr. Trump said to laughter at a campaign rally in Mississippi, referring to The Washington Post's rating system for false claims. "They got me!"

Full text: What's in store for the year ahead? Like all economists, I really don't know. But I can suggest some critical things to look out for.

Uncertainty abounds, especially about a few big policy questions. Here are four questions we may learn the answers to in the months to come.
When will the Fed stop?
Over the past year, the Federal Reserve has been raising its target for the federal funds rate, slowly and steadily. Its goal is to return interest rates to more normal levels, after a long period of roughly zero percent rates following the financial crisis and recession of 2008-9.
At some point, Fed policymakers will say they've done enough. But when? The data is offering conflicting signals.
On one hand, the labor market is tight, suggesting that inflation could be around the corner. According to the most recent reading of the employment cost index, wages and salaries for private industry are up 3 percent from a year earlier, marking the fastest growth since early 2008. Accelerating labor costs can be a precursor to rising inflation, which would call for more Fed tightening.
On the other hand, the yield curve is now relatively flat, meaning that long-term interest rates are close to short-term interest rates. If the Fed keeps tightening, short-term rates could rise above long-term rates, inverting the yield curve. An inverted yield curve is a leading indicator of a coming recession, which the Fed would like to avoid.
How will Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chairman, balance these risks? Stay tuned.
How will the trade shenanigans end?
President Trump's belligerent approach to our trading partners worries most economists, including his former economic advisers Stephen Moore and Arthur Laffer. Their recent book, "Trumponomics," is mostly a hagiography of Mr. Trump and his economic policies. But even Mr. Moore and Mr. Laffer part ways with the president on international trade. They write that he is playing a "high-stakes game of poker" and "if it doesn't work, the ramifications scare us to death."
I can imagine three possible endgames in Mr. Trump's trade skirmishes.
The best outcome is for the president to get some serious concessions from bad actors. For example, fearing worse outcomes like punitive tariffs, China might agree to start respecting American intellectual property.
A second, more likely outcome is that our trading partners accept some minor concessions, and Mr. Trump promotes the new agreements as magnificent deals and giant steps forward. This is what happened with the slightly updated Nafta, now rebranded as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.
The third and most worrisome possible outcome is an escalation of global tensions and a retreat from the principles of open trade that have promoted growth in the United States and abroad over the past half-century.
In other words, the open question about trade policy is whether Mr. Trump is crazy like a fox or just plain crazy.
Will someone pay attention to festering problems?
Some economic problems are like learning your house is infested with termites. You can delay dealing with the issue for a little while. But if you put it off indefinitely, the problem will only grow larger and more costly to solve.
Two such problems are global climate change from human carbon emissions and the looming fiscal imbalance as more baby boomers retire and start collecting Social Security and Medicare. These problems are hardly a secret, but few in Washington want to talk about them.
One approach is easy to envision. A tax on carbon emissions would encourage the movement toward cleaner energies and raise revenue for the public purse, helping address both problems.
This measure would be palatable to members of the American Economic Association. But the general public may be harder to convince. After all, the rioting in France last month was partly motivated by a modest increase in the tax on fuel.
For elected officials, the easiest approach is to let the next homeowner deal with the termites. But next year, the 2020 presidential campaign will start heating up. Maybe some candidate will try to stand out from the crowd by taking the politically risky strategy of acting like a responsible adult.
Which economic advisers will have the president's ear?
I am no fan of President Trump. But I must admit that he has some solid economic advisers. That is reassuring news if, as some fear, the economy hits the skids over the next couple of years.
Kevin Hassett, who heads the Council of Economic Advisers, is a fine economist. Larry Kudlow, who leads the National Economic Council, has spent more of his career as a TV personality than as a professional economist, but his instincts are good. Mr. Hassett and Mr. Kudlow are natural allies in White House policy debates.
But it is unclear how much the president listens to them. The problem is due in part to Mr. Trump's excessive confidence in his own judgments. Making matters worse is the role of Peter Navarro, a relatively unknown economist who became a presidential adviser because his idiosyncratic views on trade are consistent with Mr. Trump's isolationist leanings.
If there is one thing that characterizes this White House, however, it is fluidity in staffing and influence. I am rooting for the coming ascendancy of Mr. Hassett and Mr. Kudlow. This is more a hope than a forecast. But I try to start every year on an optimistic note.

Outsourcing War in Yemen With Child Soldiers

Full text: KHARTOUM, Sudan -- The civil war in Darfur robbed Hager Shomo Ahmed of almost any hope. Raiders had stolen his family's cattle, and a dozen years of bloodshed had left his parents destitute.
Then, around the end of 2016, Saudi Arabia offered a lifeline: The kingdom would pay as much as $10,000 if Hager joined its forces fighting 1,200 miles away in Yemen.
Hager, 14 at the time, could not find Yemen on a map, and his mother was appalled. He had survived one horrific civil war -- how could his parents toss him into another? But the family overruled her.
"Families know that the only way their lives will change is if their sons join the war and bring them back money," Hager said in an interview last week in the capital, Khartoum, a few days after his 16th birthday.
The United Nations has called the war in Yemen the world's worst humanitarian crisis. An intermittent blockade by the Saudis and their partners in the United Arab Emirates has pushed as many as 12 million people to the brink of starvation, killing some 85,000 children, according to aid groups.
Led by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudis say they are battling to rescue Yemen from a hostile faction backed by Iran. But to do it, the Saudis have used their vast oil wealth to outsource the war, mainly by hiring what Sudanese soldiers say are tens of thousands of desperate survivors of the conflict in Darfur to fight, many of them children.
At any time for nearly four years as many as 14,000 Sudanese militiamen have been fighting in Yemen in tandem with the local militia aligned with the Saudis, according to several Sudanese fighters who have returned and Sudanese lawmakers who are attempting to track it. Hundreds, at least, have died there.
Almost all the Sudanese fighters appear to come from the battle-scarred and impoverished region of Darfur, where some 300,000 people were killed and 1.2 million displaced during a dozen years of conflict over diminishing arable land and other scarce resources.
Most belong to the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, a tribal militia previously known as the Janjaweed. They were blamed for the systematic rape of women and girls, indiscriminate killing and other war crimes during Darfur's conflict, and veterans involved in those horrors are now leading their deployment to Yemen -- albeit in a more formal and structured campaign.
Some families are so eager for the money that they bribe militia officers to let their sons go fight. Many are ages 14 to 17. In interviews, five fighters who have returned from Yemen and another about to depart said that children made up at least 20 percent of their units. Two said children were more than 40 percent.
To keep a safe distance from the battle lines, their Saudi or Emirati overseers commanded the Sudanese fighters almost exclusively by remote control, directing them to attack or retreat through radio headsets and GPS systems provided to the Sudanese officers in charge of each unit, the fighters all said.
"The Saudis told us what to do through the telephones and devices," said Mohamed Suleiman al-Fadil, a 28-year-old member of the Bani Hussein tribe who returned from Yemen at the end of last year. "They never fought with us."
"The Saudis would give us a phone call and then pull back," agreed Ahmed, 25, a member of the Awlad Zeid tribe who fought near Hudaydah this year and who did not want his full name published for fear of government retaliation. "They treat the Sudanese like their firewood."
A few thousand Emiratis are based around the port of Aden. But the rest of the coalition the Saudis and Emiratis have assembled is united mainly by dependence on their financial aid.
The Pakistani military, despite a parliamentary vote blocking its participation, has quietly dispatched 1,000 soldiers to bolster Saudi forces inside the kingdom. Jordan has deployed jets and military advisers. Both governments rely heavily on aid from the Gulf monarchies. (A report by a United Nations panel suggested Eritrea may have sent about 400 troops as well.)
But in Sudan, which has played a far larger role, the Saudi money appears to flow directly to the fighters -- or mercenaries, as critics call them. It benefits the economy only indirectly.
"People are desperate. They are fighting in Yemen because they know that in Sudan they don't have a future," said Hafiz Ismail Mohamed, a former banker, economic consultant and critic of the government. "We are exporting soldiers to fight like they are a commodity we are exchanging for foreign currency."
A spokesman for the Saudi-led military coalition said in a statement that it was fighting to restore the internationally recognized government of Yemen and that coalition forces upheld all international humanitarian and human rights laws, including "abstaining from child recruitment."
"The allegations that there are children among the ranks of the Sudanese forces are fictitious and unfounded," the spokesman, Turki al-Malki, said in the statement. Saudi officials said their soldiers have also died in Yemen, but declined to disclose how many.
The Sudanese ground troops unquestionably have made it easier for the Saudis and Emiratis to extend the war. The Sudanese have insulated the Saudis and Emiratis from the casualties that might test the patience of families at home.
The Sudanese are sometimes deployed to defend the flanks of the Yemeni militiamen who spearhead attacks. But the Sudanese fighters insist they are also the main barrier against the Saudis' Yemeni foes, the Houthis.
"Without us, the Houthis would take all of Saudi Arabia, including Mecca," Mr. Fadil said.
Ambassador Babikir Elsiddig Elamin, a spokesman for Sudan's Foreign Ministry, declined to comment on troop levels, casualties or paychecks in Yemen. He said that Sudan was fighting "in the interest of regional peace and stability."
"Other than that," he added, "we don't have any national interest in Yemen."
Sudan's defense minister threatened last May to withdraw from the conflict, pointedly announcing that Khartoum was "reassessing" participation in light of Sudan's "stability and interests." Diplomats called the statement a veiled demand that Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates provide more financial assistance.
They did not, and the Sudanese economy teetered.
Khartoum backed down. The flow of fighters continued.
But President Omar al-Bashir of Sudan has gained valuable allies, easing his international isolation after years as a virtual pariah.
The United States has designated Mr. Bashir's government a state sponsor of terrorism for more than two decades. The International Criminal Court has issued warrants for his arrest, charging him with directing the Darfur war crimes.
Until recently, the Saudis and Emirates kept their distance, suspicious of Mr. Bashir's roots in political Islam and relations with Iran and Qatar, both Saudi rivals.
The war in Yemen, however, has enabled Mr. Bashir to win at least diplomatic support from its Gulf leaders, and he has thanked the Saudis and Emiratis for pressing Washington to upgrade relations.
The Saudi payments to the soldiers have become increasingly significant to Sudan, where inflation has hit 70 percent and even in the capital residents line up for bread, fuel and bank withdrawals. At least nine people have been killed this month by security forces.
Darfur has furnished mercenaries to other conflicts as well.
Rebel groups who fought the Janjaweed have turned up fighting in Libya for the anti-Islamist Gen. Khalifa Hifter, according to the findings of a United Nations panel and other reports.
But far more have fought in Yemen.
The five fighters who had returned from Yemen and two brothers of fighters who died there all gave similar accounts. Sudanese jets departed Khartoum or Nyala, Darfur, carrying 2,000 to 3,000 soldiers at a time to Saudi Arabia.
They were delivered to camps inside the kingdom, where some said they saw as many as 8,000 Sudanese gathered.
The Saudis issued them uniforms and weapons, which the Sudanese fighters believed were American made. Then Saudi officers provided two to four weeks of training, mainly in assembling and cleaning their guns.
Finally, they were divided into units of 500 to 750 fighters, they said. Then they traveled over land to Yemen, to battles in the Midi Desert, the Khalid ibn Walid camp in Taiz, or around Aden and Hudaydah.
All said they fought only for money. They were paid in Saudi riyals, the equivalent of about $480 a month for a 14-year-old novice to about $530 a month for an experienced Janjaweed officer. They received an additional $185 to $285 for any month they saw combat -- every month for some.
Their payments were deposited directly into the Faisal Islamic Bank of Sudan, partly owned by Saudis. At the end of a six-month rotation, each fighter also received a one-time payment of at least 700,000 Sudanese pounds -- roughly $10,000 at the current official exchange rate.
By comparison, a Sudanese doctor working overtime at multiple jobs might earn the equivalent of $500 a month, said Mr. Mohamed, the economic consultant.
Abdul Raheem, a 32-year-old member of the Rezeigat tribe whose full name was withheld to prevent reprisals, said that last year his family paid a local militia leader a bribe worth $1,360 so an older brother could go to Yemen as an officer.
The brother, Abdul Rahman, died in combat in February 2018. "Life is like that," Abdul Raheem said, stone-faced.
Abdul Rahman's wife and three children received the equivalent of $35,000 in Sudanese pounds, although banking restrictions have hindered access to it.
Some Sudanese officers had told the soldiers explicitly, "Don't fight harder than the money is worth, don't fight more than you are paid for," recalled Ahmed, of the Awlad Zeid tribe.
All the fighters complained of Houthi rockets and mines, and they recounted casualty levels ranging from 135 in Mr. Fadil's unit to about 200 in Ahmed's. When they returned they bought livestock, a Korean-made pickup truck or a small grocery store.
Hager, who went to Yemen at 14 and returned in November 2017, wore a matching khaki shirt and pants to an interview in Khartoum. His cheeks were clean. His mustache was just beginning.
His unit lost 20 men during their overland journey to a camp near Aden, where they lost 22 more in a first battle and 35 in a second -- 180 after six months.
He had been terrified every day, he said, hunching forward in his seat when he talked about combat. But his Sudanese officers let him call his parents from time to time, and now they are happy. Besides a house, he bought the family 10 cattle.

Full text: As 2018 draws to an end, we're seeing many articles about the state of the economy. What I'd like to do, however, is talk about something different -- the state of economics, at least as it relates to the political situation. And that state is not good: The bad faith that dominates conservative politics at every level is infecting right-leaning economists, too.
This is sad, but it's also pathetic. For even as once-respected economists abase themselves in the face of Trumpism, the G.O.P. is making it ever clearer that their services aren't wanted, that only hacks need apply.
What you need to know when talking about economics and politics is that there are three kinds of economist in modern America: liberal professional economists, conservative professional economists and professional conservative economists.
By "liberal professional economists" I mean researchers who try to understand the economy as best they can, but who, being human, also have political preferences, which in their case puts them on the left side of the U.S. political spectrum, although usually only modestly left of center. Conservative professional economists are their counterparts on the center right.
Professional conservative economists are something quite different. They're people who even center-right professionals consider charlatans and cranks; they make a living by pretending to do actual economics -- often incompetently -- but are actually just propagandists. And no, there isn't really a corresponding category on the other side, in part because the billionaires who finance such propaganda are much more likely to be on the right than on the left.
But let me leave the pure hacks on one side for a moment, and talk about the people who at least used to seem to be trying to do real economics.
Do economists' political preferences shape their research? They surely affect the choice of subject: Liberals are more likely to be interested in rising inequality or the economics of climate change than conservatives. And human nature being what it is, some of them -- O.K., of us -- occasionally engage in motivated reasoning, reaching conclusions that cater to their politics.
I used to believe, however, that such lapses were the exception, not the rule, and the liberal economists I know try hard to avoid falling into that trap, and apologize when they do.
But do conservative economists do the same? Increasingly, the answer seems to be no, at least for those who play a prominent role in public discourse.
Even during the Obama years, it was striking how many well-known Republican-leaning economists followed the party line on economic policy, even when that party line was in conflict with the nonpolitical professional consensus.
Thus, when a Democrat was in the White House, G.O.P. politicians opposed anything that might mitigate the costs of the 2008 financial crisis and its aftermath; so did many economists. Most famously, in 2010 a who's who of Republican economists denounced the efforts of the Federal Reserve to fight unemployment, warning that they risked "currency debasement and inflation."
Were these economists arguing in good faith? Even at the time, there were good reasons to suspect otherwise. For one thing, those terrible, irresponsible Fed actions were pretty much exactly what Milton Friedman prescribed for depressed economies. For another, some of those Fed critics engaged in Donald Trump-like conspiracy theorizing, accusing the Fed of printing money, not to help the economy, but to "bail out fiscal policy," i.e., to help Barack Obama.
It was also telling that none of the economists who warned, wrongly, about looming inflation were willing to admit their error after the fact.
But the real test came after 2016. A complete cynic might have expected economists who denounced budget deficits and easy money under a Democrat to suddenly reverse position under a Republican president.
And that total cynic would have been exactly right. After years of hysteria about the evils of debt, establishment Republican economists enthusiastically endorsed a budget-busting tax cut. After denouncing easy-money policies when unemployment was sky-high, some echoed Trump's demands for low interest rates with unemployment under 4 percent -- and the rest remained conspicuously silent.
What explains this epidemic of bad faith? Some of it is clearly ambition on the part of conservative economists still hoping for high-profile appointments. Some of it, I suspect, may be just the desire to stay on the inside with powerful people.
But there's something pathetic about this professional self-abasement, because the rewards center-right economists long for haven't come, and never will.
It's not just that Trump has assembled an administration of the worst and the dimmest. The truth is that the modern G.O.P. doesn't want to hear from serious economists, whatever their politics. It prefers charlatans and cranks, who are its kind of people.
So what we've learned about economics these past two years is that many conservative economists were, in fact, willing to compromise their professional ethics for political ends -- and that they sold their integrity for nothing.

Trump's Tax Cut One Year Later

Full text: There was a point in early 2018 when big American companies couldn't stop talking about the Trump tax cuts. Flush with the projected savings from a $1.5 trillion law, they promised to raise wages, hand out bonuses to workers and invest in big projects. They scored headlines, along with applause from President Trump.
The fawning faded quickly. Analysts noted that the handouts to workers amounted to a relatively small share of the roughly $200 billion in federal income taxes that corporations avoided thanks to the cuts. Wages across the economy ticked up, but not by nearly as much as some Republicans had promised when they voted for the law. Capital investment surged at the start of the year, but the rate of growth fell sharply in the third quarter.
Stock buybacks by publicly traded companies continue to set records. They neared $200 billion in the third quarter for S&P 500 companies. Goldman Sachs analysts have predicted that the total amount of buybacks across the economy could top $1 trillion for the full year.
Some workers did reap rewards from the law, as many companies followed through on -- and even exceeded -- their promises to raise wages and pay bonuses. Yet other firms have announced layoffs, despite reporting higher profits and billions of dollars in tax savings.
While the long-term effects remain to be seen, the evidence so far does not suggest the sustained investment and productivity growth boosts that Republicans and supply-side economists predicted. Many economists, including those at the Federal Reserve, are cutting their growth forecasts for 2019, in part because of the waning effect of the tax cuts.
Here's a look at what companies promised and what has come to pass as we head into Year Two of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
The tax cuts boosted profits for big companies
Corporate earnings over the last several quarters show why companies were such enthusiastic cheerleaders of the tax cuts. By cutting the corporate rate to 21 percent from a high of 35 percent, the law has reduced the effective tax rate that many companies pay.
That has fueled after-tax corporate profits, which rose nearly 20 percent in the third quarter from the previous year. The tax law was clearly a driver of that increase -- because profits before taxes rose at a much slower rate. In the last half-century of the American economy, it's been rare for after-tax profits to grow so much faster than before-tax profits; usually, it happens only around recessions, when companies rack up operating losses they can use to reduce tax bills. But the economy is on track to grow at about a 3 percent clip this year, after adjusting for inflation.
Walmart has so far saved at least $1.6 billion for the first three quarters of 2018, compared with what it would have paid under its previous effective rate. Bank of America has saved at least $2.4 billion over the same period. AT&T has saved $2.2 billion; Verizon has saved $1.75 billion and Apple has saved about $4.5 billion. In welcoming those windfalls, companies frequently promised to help workers.
"This tax reform will drive economic growth and create good-paying jobs," Randall Stephenson, the chairman and chief executive of AT&T, said last year, as the company announced plans to award worker bonuses and increase capital spending.
Bank of America's chief executive, Brian Moynihan, told workers in a memo last year that the new law would reduce the bank's tax rate, and that "in the spirit of shared success, we intend to pass some of those benefits along immediately" to workers.
Some companies added workers and raised wages, while others cut jobs.
Job creation accelerated across the economy this year, compared to 2017, including at several large companies that celebrated the tax cuts by expanding hiring plans. But strong growth has not spared the jobs of thousands of American workers at large companies where executives have cited automation, outsourcing and product-line restructuring to explain why they reduced employment in a year when tax cuts raised their profit margins.
After the law was approved, Apple promised to add 20,000 domestic jobs over the next five years, along with making other investments in the United States. So far, it is on track: It added 6,000 employees in 2018. (It also announced a $100 billion stock buyback program and a dividend increase worth $2 billion.)
Walmart increased its starting wage to $11 an hour, gave bonuses of up to $1,000 each for associates and expanded some worker benefits like parental leave. The wage increase amounted to $300 million more than the company had planned before the cuts. Its employment levels have not changed over the year.
Other companies have cut workers, even as they enjoy high profits and big tax windfalls. Bank of America gave bonuses of $1,000 last year, which it attributed to the law, and said this fall that soaring profits will spur a second round of bonuses. Its dividend recently jumped by 44 percent, and it has announced $20 billion in stock buybacks since the law passed.
Yet financial filings show it has cut 5,000 jobs this year, continuing a downward employment trend that dates to 2010, when Mr. Moynihan took over as chief executive. Technological changes, including a rise in mobile banking, have resulted in 100,000 jobs being eliminated during his time at the helm, Mr. Moynihan said this year.
Another bank that reaped billions from the cuts, Wells Fargo, said this fall it plans to reduce its work force by up to 10 percent, citing changes in customer demands. Wells Fargo has announced $40 billion in stock buybacks since the law passed.
AT&T handed out $200 million in worker bonuses and contributed $800 million to its employee and retiree medical trust fund. It increased its dividend for the 35th straight year.
It also appears to be shedding employees. Officials at the Communications Workers of America, the union that represents AT&T workers, say the company has cut more than 10,000 union jobs this year, accelerating its pace of cuts from last year.
Verizon has cut 3,100 positions this year, financial filings show. The company announced this month that 10,000 more workers have accepted a buyout offer as part of an effort to reduce its headcount while ramping up its push into the next generation of wireless technology, known as 5G. This fall, Verizon reached a deal to transfer about 2,500 jobs to Infosys, a large Indian technology outsourcing company.
Verizon has paid down corporate debt by $4.2 billion this year, as it said it would after the tax law passed, and granted employees 50 shares of Verizon stock, a move worth more than $400 million.
Business investment growth has slowed
Apple, Walmart and other large companies have increased their capital investment after the tax cuts, as have businesses across the economy. Nonresidential fixed investment spending grew 11.5 percent in the first quarter of the year and 8.7 percent in the second.
But growth fell to 2.5 percent in the third quarter, coinciding with a slide in oil prices -- which have disproportionately driven investment growth under Mr. Trump, compared to his recent predecessors.
White House officials predict that investment growth will bounce back next year, driving further productivity gains and lifting wages for workers, based in part on the high levels of planned investment that many business surveys continue to forecast.
"What we expect to see from the second part of the tax bill, which is the lower cost to capital and the higher investment, is just higher wage growth that's sustained," Kevin A. Hassett, the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, recently told reporters.
American workers aren't feeling happier about the law -- but companies are talking about it again
That bonus wave appeared to, very briefly, buoy public opinion of the tax cuts. The law's popularity peaked at a 51 percent approval rating in February -- after most of the announcements had just been made -- in polling conducted by the online research platform SurveyMonkey for The New York Times.
That favor has receded. In December, SurveyMonkey found, 47 percent of Americans approved of the law, while 46 percent disapproved. Republicans still praise the law and its benefits to businesses in floor speeches and news releases, but they did not make it a dominant campaign issue in November's midterm elections. Support for the law, odd as it may seem, has fallen slightly from the peak among Republicans -- and risen slightly among Democrats.
Overall economic confidence was higher in the 2018 surveys than in 2017, but "I don't know whether we can attribute that to the tax reform passage," said Laura Wronksi, one of the SurveyMonkey pollsters. She noted that Republicans have grown more economically optimistic even as their support for the law has fallen.
Mr. Hassett said -- as most economists have long predicted -- that he did not expect to see this year's wave of bonus announcements repeated next year. Few companies have followed Bank of America in announcing another batch of them.
But companies are still talking about the law -- at least to shareholders. An analysis of earnings calls by Hamilton Place Strategies found that in the third quarter of this year, large companies discussed tax reform more than any policy topic, including the tariffs that have dominated headlines and market anxiety for the past several months.

Full text: There's a saying, now associated with the investor Warren Buffett, that if you're playing poker for 30 minutes and you don't know who is the fool at the table, the fool is you. Since President Trump once owned casinos, you'd think that he might have caught on by now. Then again, those casinos went bankrupt, an outcome that Mr. Trump blamed on anyone not named Donald Trump.
Now that he's president, the table stakes are much higher. Except that Americans are the ones who are losing. With the stock market at the brink of a bear territory since September, and the S.&P. 500 off about 10 percent this year, the president continues to insist in tweets, and in conversations with his economic advisers and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, that everything would be great -- if it was not for that meddlesome Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. "The only problem our economy has is the Fed," Mr. Trump ranted on Monday. "They don't have a feel for the Market."
The Federal Reserve Board has had the temerity to do exactly what it had signaled for months it would do, steadily raise interest rates to prevent the economy from overheating. The Fed is legally mandated to maximize employment and contain inflation, not to prop up the stock market on presidential orders. Mr. Powell also signaled that the Fed would pause in this rate-raising mode if the economy began to slow. Wall Street was not surprised in the least by this pronouncement.
What surprised Wall Street -- what terrifies Wall Street -- was Mr. Trump's inquiry as to whether he had the power to fire Mr. Powell, whom he appointed in February. That injection of uncertainty was then magnified when Mr. Mnuchin announced from his Mexican vacation spot that he had chatted with six big bank C.E.O.s in an attempt to assure investors that there was adequate liquidity in the financial system. Anyone who experienced the Great Recession might recall that merely raising the idea that there might not be adequate liquidity immediately injects doubt into investors' minds about adequate liquidity, whatever assurances you attach afterward. The Dow promptly had its worst Christmas Eve trading day ever, disgorging 653 points, or 2.9 percent. After a slow start on Wednesday, major market indexes roared back, with the Dow climbing more than 1,000 points, or almost 5 percent.
Mr. Trump was in Iraq, and off Twitter, on Wednesday.
Mr. Trump is King Minus. Everything he touches turns to lead. And everyone else is at fault but him. He can't understand it. Didn't he give Mexico and Canada a great deal in replacing Nafta with Naft2? He thinks so, even though the Canadians fought furiously until they got an agreement they could live with; the Mexicans are still on the fence, if you'll pardon the pun.
And didn't he win the trade war with China? The president brays that jobs will be moving here from there, which will make the trade deficit diminish. The reality is that the trade deficit continues to climb, mostly because it helps our economy. What is diminishing instead are sales of soybeans to China, once the largest customer for American farmers. In November, China bought exactly zero soybeans from us. Merry Christmas, Iowa. Does this feel like winning?
In Mr. Trump's snow-globe reality, our days are merry and bright as long as he's in charge. It's only when those other fools interfere -- the courts, the Fed, Congress, whoever is chief of staff -- that things go wrong. Thus the government shutdown that he bragged he would own he now says belongs to the Democrats. No one is buying that one, not even in his own party. And no one is buying his $5 billion Mexico wall, either. And that includes the Mexicans. Nor should they. The number of people entering the United States from Mexico has been declining for a decade, but Mr. Trump has now wasted hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars placing American troops in Texas to protect us from an immigration threat that doesn't exist.
While a paralyzed federal government is not yet damaging the economy, the damage from Mr. Trump's other personal policy perversions is piling up. On its own, the economy, while clearly slowing, is doing well enough and will probably continue to do well enough with minimal fine tuning. Mr. Trump complains bitterly that Mr. Powell is going to turn him into Herbert Hoover by doing what the Fed is mandated to do. But what turned Hoover into Hoover is a Federal Reserve that did nothing and a Republican Congress that conducted a disastrous trade policy rife with tariffs.
The really scary part, if one continues this historical comparison, is that the Great Depression was ended not as much by smart economic policy as it was the end of a failed foreign policy marked by American isolationism in the years leading to World War II. Today, Mr. Trump's America First posture is behind his abrupt decision last week to withdraw antiterrorism troops from Syria. His own generals -- "my generals" -- and national security staff have warned that such a retreat could allow the shattered Islamic State to regroup and spread global chaos again.
But what do generals know about warfare? About as much as economists with Ph.D.s at the Fed know about the economy. That is, a lot.
Forced to forgo Florida and hunker down in the White House because of the government shutdown he orchestrated, Mr. Trump even managed to tarnish Christmas for one youngster. During a photo-op phone conversation, he called into question the 7-year-old's belief in Santa Claus.
Maybe the kid can now call Chairman Powell and commiserate, while the rest of us brace for King Minus's next touch.

Full text: Throughout Wall Street's December meltdown, analysts have been saying that markets were plunging despite plenty of evidence that the United States economy remains strong and corporate profit growth is healthy.
That argument finally found listeners on Wednesday, when early reports of a strong holiday-shopping season helped lift the S&P 500 by nearly 5 percent, its best day since 2009. The Nasdaq added 5.8 percent, and the Dow Jones industrial average rose just under 5 percent. That jump, over 1,086 points, represented the Dow's best single-session gain ever, although a number of days have eclipsed that in percentage terms.
A substantial rise in crude oil prices added to the lighter mood, as did efforts from the White House to ease up on criticism of the Federal Reserve.
The rally continued in Asia, led by Japan, where stocks on Thursday opened 3.7 percent higher.
The rebound in the United States offered investors a much-needed reprieve from a decline that had picked up speed in December. Stocks had fallen for four consecutive days through Monday, and the drop had pushed the S&P 500 to within just a few points of a bear market -- defined as a 20 percent retreat from its high.
Still, the S&P 500 is on pace for its worst annual performance since the financial crisis a decade ago and is only back to where it stood on Dec. 20. Plus, the move in prices Wednesday was most likely heightened by lighter-than-average trading volume during a holiday week.
But to some traders, the move upward finally made sense.
"Fundamentally you've got good growth here in the States, you have reasonable growth overseas, you're going to have record earnings in 2019 and possibly in 2020 as well, you've got low inflation," said Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute. Before Wednesday's steep rise, the market had fallen too far, Mr. Wren said, and it was ready to climb thanks to the underlying strength of the American economy.
The rally was broad-based. Only one stock in the S&P 500, Newmont Mining, fell.
Data from Mastercard showed that sales in the United States this holiday season grew at their fastest pace in six years, and investors flocked to the retail sector. Stock in the department store Kohl's jumped over 10 percent, and shares of Amazon, which called its season "record-breaking" without offering financial details, rose more than 9 percent.
Oil prices, too, were on the move after Russia's energy minister, Alexander Novak, told a Russian newspaper that the country would benefit from continuing to cooperate with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries on regulating production. American crude, the benchmark for oil prices, rose almost 9 percent to over $46 a barrel, and shares of large energy producers also climbed.
After leading Wall Street's recent slide, technology stocks rebounded as well. Tech investors have had plenty of causes for concern. A slowing global economy could hurt sales, tensions are rising with China on manufacturing of devices, and privacy concerns are bringing the potential for regulation. Apple shares rose 7 percent, while stock in the semiconductor maker Advanced Micro Devices gained 7.5 percent and Facebook added more than 8 percent.
Bank stocks, which have taken the brunt of recent selling as worries grew that the United States economy was weakening, rose significantly.
The rally doesn't mean that this year's precipitous decline in stock prices is over. Signs of economic health that encouraged the buying are doing little to address one of stock investors' primary concerns. They're worried that the Federal Reserve's decision to continue raising interest rates, even if at a slightly slower pace, will hurt the economy and corporate profits. Higher interest rates on bonds or even savings accounts make stock investments less appealing as an alternative.
The Fed announced an interest-rate increase last week and said it would continue to withdraw the support it had offered the economy in the wake of the financial crisis.
"The Fed is making a monumental mistake," said Barry Bannister, the head of institutional equity strategy at the broker Stifel. "They do not realize how long and by how much they've tightened already, and until they back off the market's going to have a very weak floor under it."
Adding to volatility has been the possibility that President Trump would consider firing the central bank's chairman, Jerome H. Powell, because he disagreed with Fed policy. Mr. Trump, who previously sought to hitch his political success to a rising stock market, has blamed interest-rate increases for the downturn on Wall Street.
White House officials insisted again that the president had no plans to fire Mr. Powell, news that reassured investors.
Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, told reporters Wednesday morning that Mr. Powell's job was "100 percent" safe. He echoed remarks by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Mick Mulvaney, Mr. Trump's incoming chief of staff, both of whom spent the weekend trying to persuade investors that the president did not plan to fire Mr. Powell. Those efforts had mostly backfired, in part because Mr. Trump continued to criticize his handpicked Fed chairman.
It also helped matters on Wednesday that Mr. Trump refrained from offering new criticism of the Fed, a marked difference from the days leading up to the Christmas holiday, when he railed against the central bank on Twitter and vowed to keep the government shut down for an extended period. In fact, for the first trading session in many days, Mr. Trump posted just one tweet: It was about his trip to Iraq.

Full text: TEHRAN -- Less than a year ago, he was running a thriving computer accessories business, driving a new car and renting a comfortable two-bedroom apartment in the center of Tehran. But last month, Kaveh Taymouri found himself riding a rusty motorcycle on his hourlong commute to his family's new lodgings, a 485-square-foot apartment in one of the city's worst neighborhoods, next to its sprawling cemetery.
When he arrived home one recent night at 10:30 from his new job at an arcade, there was no food on the stove. The sandwich he had for lunch would have to do.
Nevertheless, his wife and former business partner, Reihaneh, said she thought his mood was improving.
"At least he has stopped screaming in his sleep," she said.
Before their "downfall," as they call it, the Taymouris were the model middle-class Iranian family, prosperous college-educated business owners who made enough money to save for a down payment on their own home. Now, they are a model for a different sort: the millions of middle-class Iranians who almost overnight have seen their lives shrink, dragged down by economic forces beyond their control.
Iran's economy is in a shambles, savaged by years of mismanagement and renewed economic sanctions.
The government has expanded the money supply by more than 30 percent annually for more than a decade, using the extra cash to cover budget deficits and other expenses. In the United States, by comparison, a broad measure of the money supply has increased by an annual average of 6.4 percent over the last decade, according to the Federal Reserve.
As a result of Iran's rapid expansion of the money supply, says Djavad Salehi-Isfahani, a professor of economics at Virginia Tech University, inflation has exploded and by official figures is now running at an annual rate of 35 percent, compared with below 10 percent a year ago.
President Trump's decision to leave the nuclear deal, known formally as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or J.C.P.O.A., and to reimpose harsh economic sanctions prompted the other major economic disaster to befall Iran: a collapse in its currency, Mr. Salehi-Isfahani said. The rial lost about 70 percent against the dollar before strengthening recently, but its rates are still fluctuating heavily.
"The withdrawal busted the expectations for an economic boom created by the J.C.P.O.A. and Iran's return to the global economy, which was expected to boost oil exports and foreign investment," he said. "The reversal caused people to convert their rials into other assets, mainly dollars and gold."
By raising the cost of imports, the currency collapse has reinforced the inflationary surge and decimated small businesses that, like the Taymouris', rely on imported goods.
Mr. Taymouri, saying it was best to let his money -- or lack of it -- do the talking, sat down and calculated the financial calamity that had befallen the family in the past year. Their monthly income fell from 50 million rials, or about $1,400, a year ago to 10 million rials, or $90, at the current heavily devalued rate.
"If someone had ever told me I would one day live like this, I would've laughed," Mr. Taymouri said bitterly, before falling silent. Finally, his wife spoke.
"I'm not really that sad, because we are not alone," she said. "It's happening to so many people."
Mr. Taymouri attributed the fall in the currency to speculators as well as the government "for just having stood by." Others blame Mr. Trump.
"It's really because of Trump," said Nasim Marashi, the 29-year-old author of a best-selling book, "Autumn Is the Last Season." The book, on the lives of three middle-class young women in Tehran, has had 35 print runs in four years. "He left the nuclear agreement, not Iran."
Iran, with a population of about 80 million, has long had a large and thriving middle class, covering roughly everyone from bus drivers to lawyers and doctors, and earning an average of $700 a month in local currency, according to government officials. That income was frequently padded by unreported side businesses in the country's large black market and government subsidies that lowered the cost of utilities, food and gasoline.
Politically quite influential, Iran's middle class has consistently favored candidates like the current president, Hassan Rouhani, who support better relations with the West. But seldom have they been under as much economic pressure as they are today. Recently at least two people have been hanged after they were convicted in highly publicized trials for manipulating markets.
In a sign that the government is taking the issue seriously, Mr. Rouhani introduced his administration's budget on Tuesday, and it included more support for state employees and more subsidies on basic goods.
Not all have suffered as much as the Taymouris, whose business was so vulnerable to the currency collapse. But Abbas Torkan, a former adviser to Mr. Rouhani, said recently that the middle class had shrunk by 50 percent.
Even for those in higher income ranges, the difficult times have meant a sudden lifestyle change.
Royalties checks for Ms. Marashi's book dropped from 120 million rials a month to 20 million rials recently, she said. "Books aren't a necessity."
Outwardly, Tehran looks every bit the bustling metropolis it has been. New restaurants are still opening. An Iranian theater version of "Les Misérables" sells out every night for 3,500 people who pay the equivalent of $16 a person. But cracks are appearing.
In supermarkets, where the cost of Red Bull, for example, has quadrupled, people can be seen carefully studying the prices. Some imported products, like Purina pet food, have vanished entirely.
Along Tehran's high-end shopping district on Jordan Street, stores selling Western brands are shutting down. Rent increases are pushing people out of their longtime neighborhoods, and plane tickets to Europe now often cost two months' salary.
The pain many people are feeling may just be the start, said Faezeh Forouzan, an Iranian economist. "For the short term, those better off in the middle class will respond by changing their lifestyle, eliminating luxuries and excess," she said. "But in the future, all will suffer as a result of a lack of investment in creating jobs."
For the Taymouris, the pain was seemingly instantaneous. They met five years ago at work, and between stealing kisses by the copy machine, they figured out they could make more money with their own business selling computer accessories.
From their shop in the center of Tehran, the couple would buy keyboards, cables and other computer accessories from wholesalers. Ms. Taymouri would then resell them in the provinces, while her husband took care of the shop and short-term financing for the business.
A son was born, and just weeks before everything came crashing down, they happily informed their parents that they were expecting a second child.
But in January, the rial began to slide, and goods like the Taymouris' accessories that were priced in dollars and euros rapidly became unaffordable for most Iranians. Ms. Taymouri's phone stopped ringing, and sales orders dried up.
A Western Digital hard disk still costs around the equivalent of $90 in Iran, but in the local currency it soared to 18 million rials from 3 million, Ms. Taymouri said. "When your customers make only twice that a month," she added, "you can understand how our sales went down to zero."
At the same time, Mr. Taymouri was getting plenty of calls -- from the wholesalers he had bought accessories from on credit.
"They were asking for their money, but clients in the provinces weren't paying us back and we were not selling anything," he said.
One night, Ms. Taymouri said, "he just came home, dropped on the couch and said, 'It's over."'
In a country that still puts debtors in jail, the Taymouris had no choice but to make good on their debts. They sold the car, their furniture and the carpets they had been given as wedding presents.
Mr. Taymouri sold the shop to the arcade man on the condition that he could work there. Then they moved to their current apartment, which has a communal shower in the hallway.
"We don't like it here," he said, gesturing to the cemetery, one of the largest in the world. "We had been planning to move uptown, not next to the dead."
Mr. Taymouri brought out his infant daughter, Anita, from the tiny bedroom, and his wife started crying.
"I was just pregnant when everything suddenly turned upside down in our lives," she said. "I admit that I thought of having an abortion. But despite all of this, I'm so happy we have her now."
Even Iranians in the upper strata of the middle class, like Ms. Marashi, are feeling the pinch. Malmal, her white Persian cat, played in the background as Ms. Marashi's husband, a filmmaker, rummaged in the refrigerator.
"We are very lucky that we bought this house last year," she said. "Now, we would never be able to afford it."
In her book, the three main characters face setbacks after the anti-government protests of 2009. One gets fired from her job as a reporter, the other becomes depressed about society and the third dreams of emigration but cannot get a visa.
"Had I written the book now, there would be no reference to visas, as going abroad has become too expensive," she said. "Getting fired as a journalist is still possible, but more so because paper has gotten too expensive and publications are closing."
The couple had been planning a European tour around an award she had won in Italy, but a ticket now costs more than she makes in two months, she said. "So we canceled."
Still, Ms. Marashi said things could be worse, thinking of people who lived through the 1980s war with Iraq.
"We have had much harder times," she said.

Traders Spend Holiday Fearing More Bad News

Full text: For anyone closely watching the financial markets, the calm of Christmas on Tuesday was infused with anxiety.
Traders were bracing for the possibility of bad news on Wednesday, something bigger than just another day of stock market declines: If stocks don't reverse their recent sell-off, the United States is poised to close the books on the longest bull market on record.
The major benchmark stock indexes are nearing losses of more than 20 percent from their peaks, a bear market's official marker, which would end a nearly decade-long run of gains. From its high on Sept. 20, the S&P 500 is down 19.7 percent.
The market has reached this point after a rare downward streak this month -- stocks fell for four consecutive days through Monday. Investors have looked past evidence of economic strength, however, and toward a potential slowdown in 2019.
Messages from the White House over the long holiday weekend kept investors on edge. President Trump was repeatedly critical of his handpicked Federal Reserve chairman, Jerome H. Powell. In a Twitter post on Monday, he said, "The only problem our economy has is the Fed. They don't have a feel for the Market, they don't understand necessary Trade Wars or Strong Dollars or even Democrat Shutdowns over Borders." Top advisers, however, tamped down talk that the president was considering trying to fire him.
Furthermore, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin made an awkward attempt to calm markets with a statement on the health of the financial system. He said on Sunday that he had called bank executives to ensure the markets were functioning properly.
Those worries have joined other concerns, including weakness in global trade and the economic impact of a potentially lengthy government shutdown, to feed the volatility on Wall Street.
On Tuesday, Mr. Trump again expressed dissatisfaction with the Federal Reserve. Asked about Mr. Powell, he told reporters, "Well, we'll see. They're raising rates too fast. That's my opinion."
But in a seeming recognition that his criticism of the Fed is adding to jitters, the president noted that the recent decision to raise interest rates reflected the strength of the economy. "The fact is, the economy is doing so well that they raised interest rates, and that is a form of safety, in a way," he said.
And he urged Americans to buy stocks.
"I think it's a tremendous opportunity to buy," he said. "Really, a great opportunity to buy."
Initial reaction was positive. In Japan, where stocks slumped 5 percent on Tuesday, the market opened on Wednesday 1.5 percent higher.
But some investors remain cautious.
"The market has only gone down basically in a straight line for the last two weeks. It's healthy to have corrections but to have no reprieves and no rallies during that time isn't good," said Matthew Turk, an investor in San Diego who manages his own money.
Mr. Turk said he was "concerned" about what's in store for the markets on Wednesday. "It's not healthy. It feels like it's never-ending right now."
Charles Campbell, a managing director at MKM Partners, which provides trading services for big money managers like pension funds, hedge funds and mutual funds, said he began communicating with his clients at 6 a.m. on Christmas morning.
He hoped a recent article he had read, published by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, could offer some peace of mind. It suggested that inflation might be falling short of economists' forecasts, a data point that could persuade the Federal Reserve to keep rates lower for longer.
Mr. Campbell said the Fed's rate increases had been weighing on the markets. Investors were beginning to fear a slowdown and wanted to see more acknowledgment from the Fed that it would change course in the face of economic weakness.
Mr. Campbell said if the Fed did slow down its rate increases, it could provide relief the markets sorely need.
King Lip, the chief strategist at Baker Avenue Wealth Management, said he was looking toward big companies' earnings reports as a potential break from the bad news.
Public companies try to avoid surprising investors, offering plenty of hints about how their quarterly results will look, and Mr. Lip said the indications for some of the largest companies were still positive.
"We've been following what companies have been telling us over the last few weeks and generally what they've been saying has been pretty good," Mr. Lip said. The coming earnings season in January, he said, could bring a respite from the sell-off: "Even if we dip into bear-market territory, I think it's going to reverse."

Full text: This was meant to be a new era for Sudan. Last year the United States ended two decades of sanctions that President Omar al-Bashir had long blamed for his country's poverty and isolation, a move that promised new investment, perhaps even an economic rebirth.
But when Mr. Bashir then ended fuel and wheat subsidies, at the suggestion of international lending partners, protests broke out.
And over the past week, festering public anger compounded by nearly 30 years of frustration over corruption and economic mismanagement has grown into demonstrations so big and widespread that some say they could topple Mr. Bashir's military government, or at least seriously challenge its legitimacy.
Sudan, a predominantly Arab country on the edge of sub-Saharan Africa, entered its sixth day of protests on Monday, with more planned later this week, including a mass procession to the presidential palace, an elaborate Chinese-built complex opened only three years ago.
The Sudanese Professional Association, the organization planning Tuesday's rally, said in a statement that it would submit a memorandum to the Parliament to "demand the regime to give up the political and executive power to the Sudanese people who flooded the cities with their sole demand to end the regime's 30 years of dictatorship."
Monday's demonstration, organized by doctors, followed days of violence during which security forces fired tear gas and at least nine people were killed, according to Amnesty International. Local journalists put the death toll much higher, saying up to 28 had perished in clashes.
The authorities have arrested 14 leaders of the National Consensus Forces, an opposition coalition, according to news reports citing its spokesman. The government has shut down internet service and social media sites, as well as universities and schools in the capital, in an apparent attempt to dissuade people from joining the protests.
"The regime is panicking," said Hafiz Ismail Mohamed, an activist with Justice Africa, a nongovernmental organization. "I have never seen them panicking like this."
Protests had begun spontaneously and without apparent leaders, he said, but now, people were organizing themselves into a movement.
A government spokeswoman said she would comment on the protests, but subsequent calls went unanswered.
Many Sudanese have described hundreds of people lining up just to buy bread, withdraw limited amounts of cash -- their salaries -- from bank machines or sleeping in their cars for two days waiting to fill up on gas.
Inflation has been so rampant, reaching an annual rate of 70 percent in November, according to government data, that many ordinary Sudanese can no longer spend money on meat or fuul, a staple food made of cooked fava beans. Some people now spend 40 percent of their income just on bread, Mr. Mohamed said.
Sudan has a long history of street uprisings, two of which brought down the government. Recently, the country saw protests over rising fuel and bread prices in 2013 and earlier this year, but they were largely contained in the capital and snuffed out by the security forces.
This time, the protests started in the eastern city of Atbara, a former locus of anticolonial and union activity. The demonstration then quickly spread to half a dozen cities.
"The Bashir regime has been facing a crisis of legitimacy," said Zachariah Mampilly, a professor of political science at Vassar College and the author of "Africa Uprising: Popular Protest and Political Change."
Last year's lifting of American sanctions came as the Trump administration said the Sudanese government had made progress on a number of issues, including counterterrorism.
The State Department also said the government had stopped attacking civilians and had improved in allowing humanitarian aid to reach troubled regions like Darfur, where Mr. Bashir's government stands accused of massacring hundreds of thousands of people in a genocide starting in 2003.
Washington said the country was also curbing its destabilizing activities in neighboring South Sudan, which split off as an independent nation in 2011. Sudan is also playing a central role in the United States-backed war in Yemen.
But the United States is still keeping Sudan on its list of terrorism sponsors, which means it will not be granted debt relief, a major drag on the economy.
The International Monetary Fund sent a team to Khartoum in July, and Sudan has started a series of reforms and austerity measures in line with its recommendations, including the removal of subsidies, to try to bolster the economy as it struggles with high inflation and a shortage of hard currency.
The monetary fund has not yet agreed to a loan -- one could follow further down the line -- but has committed to technical assistance.
"They thought they could address the economic crisis but could not foresee the political reaction" that the effort would cause, Mr. Mampilly said.
The measures by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank were designed to alleviate economic suffering, said Ahmed Soliman, an expert on the Horn of Africa at Chatham House, a London-based foreign affairs institute. "But in the short term they have been harmful," he added. "The subsidies were meant to stimulate growth and companies to trade and that's not happening."
In part, Sudan is still suffering from South Sudan's decision to secede, taking with it nearly 75 percent of Sudanese oil reserves. Until the secession, oil revenues consisted of more than half of Sudan's revenues, Mr. Soliman said, and about 90 percent of exports.
But the larger problem, many Sudanese say, is that Mr. Bashir's government, in power since a military coup in 1989, has not made any significant investments in infrastructure, agriculture or its people, though it has promised to build a museum recording the malign effects of American sanctions.
Only 7 percent of the national budget goes to the health sector, for example, compared to 75 percent to defense, security and salaries and perks for senior officials, said Mr. Mohamed, of Justice Africa. The elite has stolen a lot of the wealth too, he added, an accusation government officials have denied in the past.
"This regime has no ability to stop the protests by having economic reforms," he said, "because the structure of the economy is so corrupt that they don't have a clue how to run it."
"The regime has hit a wall," he added, "and they don't know what to do."

White House Keeps Jolting Markets on Fragile Footing

Full text: A 48-hour effort by the Trump administration to soothe jittery financial markets did little to reverse the free fall in stocks on Monday, as the president's renewed attack on the Federal Reserve and the specter of a prolonged government shutdown further rattled investors already worried about a global economic slowdown.
With a single tweet on Monday, President Trump undercut his top economic advisers' efforts to reassure the markets that he did not intend to fire Jerome H. Powell as Fed chairman. But Mr. Trump, who blames the Fed's recent interest rate increases for the market gyrations, said "the only problem our economy has is the Fed," an assertion that exacerbated the worst sell-off on Wall Street since the 2008 financial crisis.
Stocks continued marching toward their largest December declines since the 1930s, with the S&P 500 closing down 2.7 percent on Monday after a shortened trading session ahead of the Christmas holiday.
The markets are trying to digest the confusing signals from Washington. On Saturday, the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, posted what he said was a quote from Mr. Trump acknowledging that, while he did not agree with the Fed's recent interest rate increases, he did not have any plans to fire Mr. Powell. And Mick Mulvaney, Mr. Trump's incoming chief of staff, said on ABC's "This Week" that Mr. Trump now realized he lacked authority to fire Mr. Powell, his handpicked chairman.
For the markets, the Fed is a complicated player at the moment. Investors have been disappointed by rising interest rates, concerned that they could sap growth. But the speculation about firing Mr. Powell, a move that could turn the independent central bank into a political tool, has undermined confidence in a pivotal institution essential to economic policy.
Markets have already been on edge in recent weeks because of uncertainty surrounding trade negotiations between the United States and China, signs of slowing global growth, and the prospect of a prolonged government shutdown in the United States. Mr. Mnuchin added to the economic jitters by announcing on Sunday that he had called bank executives to ensure the markets were functioning properly, the type of discussions usually reserved for moments of crisis.
"It signaled a sense of panic and anxiety that didn't need to be there," said Brian Gardner, an analyst at the investment banking firm Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. "My first reaction when I heard it was, what has happened over the last couple of days that the market does not understand or realize? Is there something that Treasury knows that the rest of us don't?"
And while Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Mulvaney tried to reassure markets on the Fed's leadership, there is still an effort within the White House to discern whether any legal rationale exists for removing Mr. Powell from the chairman spot, according to two people familiar with the discussions.
Peter Navarro, Mr. Trump's top trade adviser, has been openly critical of the Fed's decision to raise interest rates and blamed the central bank for the market volatility. Mr. Mnuchin, meanwhile, has said the recent stock swings are the result of high-speed electronic trading and post-crisis financial rules that he says make it harder for banks to play their traditional market-stabilization role.
Mr. Trump on Monday made clear he is still not happy with Mr. Powell, likening the Fed to a "powerful golfer who can't score because he has no touch - he can't putt!"
Those attacks have drawn criticism from former Fed officials as well as lawmakers from both parties, who say that any attempt to turn the Fed into a political organ would undermine its credibility. Most developed nations have granted their central banks considerable autonomy over policymaking precisely because of concerns that politicians would seek to increase short-term growth at the expense of inflation and instability.
On Monday, Senator Jeff Flake, the retiring Arizona Republican, posted a photograph on Twitter of a 5-billion-dollar bank note from Zimbabwe and urged the president to back off.
"I've lived in countries where the Head of State has used the central bank for political purposes," he said. "Please respect the Fed's independence, Mr. President."
And Wall Street is bracing for more intervention from a president who views the stock market as a report card of his presidency. Henrietta Treyz, director of economic policy research at the investment advisory firm Veda Partners, spent her weekend studying the 1935 Banking Act to determine whether Mr. Trump could unseat Mr. Powell as chairman but keep him on the Fed board without violating the law. She has yet to determine whether that could pass legal muster.
Treasury officials tried to brush away criticism of Mr. Mnuchin's public statement and his calls to bank executives, saying he was trying to ensure that banks had ample liquidity for lending. But the conversations were described by several on the receiving end as more routine than the striking statement suggested.
The Treasury secretary asked for updates on how markets were functioning and inquired about any stresses in the system, according to one bank chief executive. Another bank C.E.O. was so unconcerned about the recent fall in stocks that he used his time with Mr. Mnuchin to discuss new capital requirements and how they could affect the bank's balance sheet in the long term as the Fed continues selling government securities it amassed during the financial crisis, according to a person with knowledge of the discussion.
Policymakers who participated in the President's Working Group call on Monday also described it as a routine meeting, with no market problems reported and nothing to warrant an official statement after the discussion. The call was described by a person familiar with the conversation as a "check-in" scheduled at the Treasury's request for officials so they could plan for a prolonged government shutdown.
Negotiations to end the partial government shutdown have remained at an impasse since midnight Friday when funding lapsed for a number of federal agencies and nine departments, including the Treasury. Neither chamber is expected to reconvene until Thursday, with House lawmakers looking to the Senate Democrats and Mr. Trump to reach a compromise over border security funding.
The decision to convene the working group, which became known as the Plunge Protection Team during the 2008 financial crisis, struck some former officials as curious given that its duties have mostly been taken over by the Financial Stability Oversight Council. That body, which was created by the 2010 Dodd-Frank law, held a public meeting last week when it also published its annual report, which had little mention of market concerns.
"Now that the administration has chosen this extremely rare policy approach of verbal intervention in the stock market its credibility is at risk should markets settle lower," said Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading.
Former Treasury officials said Mr. Mnuchin had probably amplified concerns about the markets by publicizing his efforts to calm them.
"I never heard anyone in any venue in the last two months voice any concerns about liquidity," said Paul H. O'Neill, who served as Treasury secretary under President George W. Bush, noting that Mr. Mnuchin had injected more uncertainty into the calculations of investors.
Mr. O'Neill also suggested that Mr. Mnuchin was in a difficult position in trying to assuage a mercurial boss and could be overcompensating to please him.
"The president apparently is blaming Mnuchin for the markets going south, which is a fairly strange thing," he said.
Sarah Bloom Raskin, a former deputy secretary of the Treasury under President Barack Obama and a former Fed governor, said Mr. Mnuchin would be better served keeping conversations about financial stability private.
"When you do something like that you've got to be really careful and quiet about it," Ms. Raskin said. "You run the risk of planting the seeds of doubt in people's minds."
But, Ms. Raskin suggested, Mr. Mnuchin could have been trying to show the president, who canceled his own Florida vacation, that he was working hard despite traveling with his children to a resort in Mexico.
"Maybe he's just worried because he's in Cabo, the markets are going down and the Treasury secretary is in another country and they don't like the optics of that," she said.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- President Trump has unabashedly hitched his political fortunes to a rising stock market. Now, with stock prices in retreat, he has become increasingly fixated on the idea that one man is to blame for the recent rout: Jerome H. Powell, chairman of the Federal Reserve.
After the Fed raised its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday, the fifth consecutive quarterly increase, Mr. Trump fretted to aides that Mr. Powell would "turn me into Hoover," a reference to the man who was president in the early years of the Great Depression.
Mr. Trump has said choosing Mr. Powell for the Fed job last year was the worst mistake of his presidency, and he has asked aides whether he has the power to fire him.
But the volatile stock market, which just posted its worst week since 2008, is falling in part because of Mr. Trump's own policies, including an escalating trade war with China, a shutdown of the federal government and the fading effects of the $1.5 trillion tax cut Mr. Trump ushered in at the end of 2017. While the Fed's rate increases have upset investors -- who seem to have a darker view of economic growth than the central bank does -- some analysts said Mr. Trump's musings about the Fed would only exacerbate anxieties.
"If Powell gets terminated, what we've seen happen in the markets in the past few weeks will look like a walk in the park," David Rosenberg, chief economist at Gluskin Sheff, said in an email on Sunday. "The dollar will go into a tailspin, and even confidence in the Treasury market will erode, especially among foreign creditors."
Mr. Trump's economic advisers scrambled over the weekend to reassure markets that Mr. Trump was not, in fact, planning to fire Mr. Powell. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin tweeted what he said was a quote from Mr. Trump accepting that he did not even have the power to do so.
"I totally disagree with Fed policy," Mr. Mnuchin quoted Mr. Trump as saying. "I think the increasing of interest rates and the shrinking of the Fed portfolio is an absolute terrible thing to do at this time, especially in light of my major trade negotiations which are ongoing, but I never suggested firing Chairman Jay Powell, nor do I believe I have the right to do so."
Mick Mulvaney, the incoming acting White House chief of staff, implied on Sunday that Mr. Trump had, in fact, inquired about removing Mr. Powell, saying on ABC's "This Week" that the president "now realizes he does not have the authority." But Mr. Mulvaney added that he had heard this from Mr. Mnuchin, not from Mr. Trump.
Mr. Trump has not addressed the issue directly, including on his own Twitter feed, which he has frequently used to criticize the Fed. The White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, told reporters on Saturday, "I'm aware of no plans to fire Mr. Powell" -- but that brief statement stopped well short of corroborating Mr. Mnuchin's account of the president's views.
Mr. Mnuchin has worked in recent days to obtain Mr. Trump's assurance that he would not remove Mr. Powell, according to an administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity. But that person cautioned that Mr. Trump could change his mind. The person noted Mr. Trump has a tendency to nurse grudges even when he temporarily sets a subject aside.
Mr. Mnuchin has been under pressure from Mr. Trump to stabilize markets, which are on pace for the largest December declines since the 1930s. In a statement Sunday, Mr. Mnuchin said he had contacted the chief executives of six major banks to make sure their operations were running smoothly.
Mr. Mnuchin, who made the calls while on vacation in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, said that bank executives confirmed they had sufficient liquidity for lending and market operations -- the kind of statement the government usually reserves for moments of genuine uncertainty about the health of the financial system. The statement added that Mr. Mnuchin would convene a meeting of the President's Working Group on financial markets, which he leads, to coordinate efforts to "assure normal market operations."
The Fed's unanimous decision to raise its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday reflected the confidence of its officials that the economy remains strong -- even as they insisted that future rate increases would depend on continued growth. By raising rates, the Fed is bringing to a close its long campaign of economic stimulus that began during the 2008 financial crisis, which included lowering interest rates to near zero.
Still, Mr. Trump is hardly alone in his opposition to the Fed's move. Some economists argue the Fed should continue its stimulus campaign to drive up employment and wages. They note that the Fed is about to undershoot its 2 percent inflation target for the seventh consecutive year, suggesting there is no need to step on the brakes.
Many investors had also wanted a pause, and the decision set off another slide in stock prices.
But even investors who disagreed with Wednesday's decision generally do not want politicians to play a larger role in Fed policymaking, preferring to leave the management of interest rates primarily in the hands of technocrats. Most developed nations have granted their central banks considerable autonomy over policymaking precisely because of concerns that politicians would seek to increase short-term growth at the expense of inflation and instability.
In fact, during his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump accused the Fed of getting political, saying that the bank's chairwoman at the time, Janet L. Yellen, should be "ashamed" for keeping interest rates low -- a move he said was meant to help President Barack Obama.
"Markets are in the business of looking forward, and looking forward to a world with greatly diminished central bank independence isn't something that markets should find comforting," Eric Winograd, senior United States economist at AllianceBernstein, said in an email.
Senators from both parties also warned the president against firing Mr. Powell. The president's deliberations on Mr. Powell's fate were first reported by Bloomberg News.
"I'd be very careful about doing that," Senator Richard Shelby, an Alabama Republican and a former chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, told reporters on Saturday. "The independence of the Fed is the foundation of our banking system."
Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, said, "Given the Fed's consensus on monetary policy, any effort to remove Powell would hit the trifecta: unlawful, ineffective and damaging to the economy."
A key question is whether Mr. Trump has the legal authority to remove Mr. Powell. The Federal Reserve Act, which had its 105th anniversary on Sunday, says the president can remove members of the Fed's board of governors, including Mr. Powell, only "for cause."
No president has ever tried, but legal scholars say the language is generally interpreted as meaning the president could not remove Mr. Powell over a policy disagreement.
The law, however, does not address the president's authority to remove Mr. Powell from his role as Fed chairman without removing him from the Fed's board, a move that some of the president's advisers have urged.
But it is far from clear such a decision would serve the president's purpose. A replacement for Mr. Powell would require Senate confirmation, and this person would join a policymaking committee that voted unanimously for the December rate increase. That committee also might be inclined, on future rate decisions, to demonstrate its independence from the president.
While Mr. Trump has turned on his chairman, the Fed's trajectory should not have been a surprise.
When Mr. Trump chose Mr. Powell as Fed chairman in the fall of 2017, he said, "Based on his record, I am confident that Jay has the wisdom and leadership to guide our economy through any challenges that our great economy may face."
Mr. Trump also chose three of the other four members of the Fed's board, all of whom joined Mr. Powell in voting for all four 2018 rate increases.
In conversations with friends and advisers, Mr. Trump has acknowledged responsibility for the selection of Mr. Powell. He told Stephen Moore, an economist at the Heritage Foundation, that it was "one of the worst choices I've ever made," according to Mr. Moore.
Some of Mr. Trump's economic advisers have encouraged him to remove Mr. Powell, arguing that the decision would reverse recent stock declines.
Others, including Mr. Mnuchin, have warned that Mr. Trump would harm his own interests.
Sarah Binder, a professor of political science at George Washington University, said presidents had often tried to shape Fed policy, but the current episode stood apart because Mr. Trump appeared to be acting against his own interest in a stable economy.
"I think what is the unusual part here is that it seems the president has created the crisis," she said. "His intervention certainly seems to be making things worse for him and worse for the Fed and worse for the economy. It's just very shortsighted, and we're not used to that."

Nike's Strong Earnings Ease Trade Woes
Nike Inc shares rose 8 percent on Friday, after the company's solid quarterly results eased worries that escalating trade tensions between Washington and Beijing would weigh on China demand and hurt the sportswear maker's growth story.
The company's double-digit percentage growth in China was in addition to strong demand in North America, Nike's biggest and most competitive market, where sales got a boost from higher full-priced sales and a rebound in Jordan sneakers.
Nike has focused on new launches as well as on a direct-to-customer model of its own stores and online sales to temper the hit from bankruptcies of sports retailers and competition from the likes of Adidas AG and Under Armour Inc. in the United States.
Its efforts have borne fruit. The company engineered a rebound in its North America market, clawing back market share from global rivals. REUTERS

Crippling Debts Delay Nigerian Power Plant
Plans to build another privately financed power station in Nigeria to help end decades of chronic blackouts have been delayed because of concerns about persistent shortfalls in payments for electricity across the sector.
The $1.1 billion Qua Iboe Power Plant being developed by energy infrastructure company Black Rhino and the state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation won't get a green light by the end of 2018 as planned and it was unclear when the deal might close, the state company told Reuters.
The delay is a setback for Africa's biggest oil producer where 80 million people don't have access to grid power supplies and it exposes the difficulties in attracting private investment to a sector that successive governments have tried to reform.
The uncertainty surrounding the 540-megawatt Qua Iboe plant stems from the difficulties Nigeria's first privately-financed independent power project -- the 460-megawatt Azura-Edo plant -- has encountered since it came online this year. REUTERS
ECONOMY
Consumer Spending Rose In November
Americans lifted their spending 0.4 percent in November from the previous month, a moderate gain that should sustain steady economic growth.
Personal incomes rose 0.2 percent, down from 0.5 percent in the previous month, the Commerce Department said Friday.
Consumer spending jumped by the most in 13 months in October, and November's solid gain on top of that points to healthy spending in the final three months of the year. Economists closely watch consumer spending because it accounts for about two-thirds of economic activity.
Business spending is showing signs of slowing, leaving more of the burden on consumers to power the economy. A gauge of business investment in large equipment such as machinery and computers fell in November for the third time in four months, according to a separate report Friday.
A measure of inflation tied to consumer purchases slipped, rising 1.8 percent from a year ago, down from last month's 2 percent annual gain. A.P.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- A senior Federal Reserve official sought to soothe financial markets on Friday, emphasizing that the Fed is paying attention to investors' concerns that the economic expansion is weakening.
John Williams, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, defended the Fed's decision to raise its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday, and said the central bank expected economic growth to remain strong enough that it would need to continue raising interest rates in 2019.
But he said plans were not promises and that, if the economy weakens, the Fed will adjust.
"We're going to go into the new year with eyes wide open, willing to read the data, listen to what we're hearing, reassess our economic outlook and take the right policy decisions that will keep this economy strong," Mr. Williams said in an interview with CNBC that aired shortly after markets opened on Friday.
The emphasis on flexibility drew an immediate reaction from investors. The S&P 500 stock index rose as Mr. Williams spoke, briefly posting a 1 percent gain. But Mr. Williams's message was not enough to reverse the downward momentum in equity markets, which have been rattled by the prospect of a government shutdown on top of global economic weakness and trade uncertainty. By the end of the day, the S&P index was down 2.1 percent to end the worst week for American equity markets since the 2008 financial crisis.
The contrast between the apparent strength of the domestic economy and the downturn in stock prices partly reflects the weakness of economic growth in foreign markets, where American companies reap a large share of their profits. It also reflects a striking divergence in views about the economic outlook.
The Fed expects economic growth to continue next year. Many equity investors appear to disagree.
So far, the data seems to be on the Fed's side. The Commerce Department reported on Friday that consumer spending remained strong in November, increasing for the ninth consecutive month. In the same report, it said that inflation had weakened modestly. The department's index of personal consumption expenditures rose by 1.8 percent over the 12 months through November.
The index is the Fed's preferred measure of inflation, and the latest reading indicates the central bank is likely to undershoot its target of 2 percent annual inflation for the seventh straight year.
Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont, said pessimism in financial markets was strikingly at odds with the latest economic data. "The consumer is on fire," Mr. Stanley wrote in a note to clients. "If the stock market is trying to signal that the U.S. economy is crumbling, Mr. Market is wrong."
In an interview, Mr. Stanley said that investors were also unduly concerned about the impact of the Fed's rate increases. The Fed's benchmark rate is now in a range of 2.25 percent to 2.5 percent, a level that Mr. Stanley said was still likely to provide a little stimulus to economic growth.
"I don't think the Fed is tapping the brakes yet," he said.
The White House, by contrast, continued to warn on Friday that the Fed was jeopardizing economic growth by repeatedly raising interest rates. Peter Navarro, the director of the president's National Trade Council, told the Japanese publication Nikkei Asian Review that the Fed's forecast of two rate increases next year was "two too many." Mr. Navarro added, "We don't understand why the Fed is acting so contractionary, at a time when there's no inflation to worry about."
While President Trump has also warned the Fed to stop raising rates, another White House official, Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, later disputed that Mr. Navarro spoke for the administration.
"I would not concur with Peter," Mr. Hassett told CNBC. "I think the appropriate position for an economist in the White House is to respect the independence of the Fed and not comment on their policies."
Mr. Williams's appearance on Friday morning was carefully calibrated. Fed officials are barred from speaking publicly about policy on the day after a policy meeting, so Friday offered the earliest opportunity to address the market's reaction to Wednesday's decision.
Mr. Williams is also the vice chairman of the Fed's policymaking committee, and a close adviser to the Fed's chairman, Jerome H. Powell, giving his words added weight.
The content of his remarks closely resembled the views that Mr. Powell offered at a Wednesday news conference that sent markets tumbling. He said that the Fed thought the economy was strong, and would remain strong, and that most Fed officials expected the central bank to raise rates twice in 2019.
But there was a marked difference in emphasis. Mr. Williams said several times that the Fed was aware that many investors had a bleaker outlook, and that economic conditions would dictate the Fed's decision.
"We are not sitting there thinking we know for sure what's going to happen," he said.
Mr. Williams also sought to make the case that investors had overlooked some of the nuances in the policy statement the Fed released on Wednesday. He noted that in previous statements the Fed said it "expects" to continue raising interest rates, while in the most recent statement it used the word "judges." This was intended to reflect increased uncertainty about the outlook, Mr. Williams said.
The Fed also included new language saying it would "continue to monitor global economic and financial developments and assess their implications for the economic outlook."

Full text: I have a confession to make: I have been insufficiently cynical about modern conservative economics.
Longtime readers may find this hard to believe. After all, I declared Paul Ryan a "flimflam man" back when all the cool kids were gushing about his courage and honesty, giving him awards for fiscal responsibility. (Events have settled the issue: Yes, he was and is a flimflam man.) I predicted early and often that Republican cries about the evils of debt would vanish as soon as they held the White House; sure enough, after forcing the U.S. into job-destroying austerity when the economy was weak, once in power they blew up the budget deficit with a tax cut for corporations and the wealthy, despite low unemployment.
But while I yield to nobody in my appreciation of the right's fiscal fraudulence, I took its monetary hawkishness seriously. I thought that all those dire warnings about the inflationary consequences of the Federal Reserve's efforts to fight high unemployment, the constant harping on the evils of printing money, were grounded in genuine -- stupid, but genuine -- concern.
Silly me.
It's no surprise that Individual-1, who lambasted the Fed for keeping interest rates low while Barack Obama was president, is demanding that it keep rates low now that he's in the White House. After all, nobody has ever accused Donald Trump of having consistent, principled views about monetary policy (or anything else).
But it is a shock to see so many conservative voices -- including, incredibly, the editorial page of The Wall Street Journal -- echoing Trump's demands.
It's hard to overstate just how consistent and intense The Journal and others of like mind used to be in their attacks on easy money. Many commentators have noted that three years ago The Journal declared that low interest rates are bad for the economy. But that was minor compared with the newspaper's pronouncements during the financial crisis. For example, it attacked and ridiculed Ben Bernanke for cutting interest rates in December 2008 -- that is, at a time when the economy was in free fall, and desperately needed all the support it could get.
Now, you might say that the explanation for the right's about-face on monetary policy is the same as the explanation of its about-face on deficits. That is, Republicans want pain and suffering when there's a Democratic president, but a nonstop party when one of their own sits in the White House. And that is indeed how it looks now. But I used to think there was something more to the story.
You see, as a pundit who, well, gets a lot of hate mail, I've learned that the issue of whether it sometimes makes sense to print money stirs more visceral emotions on the right than anything else. Declare that Trump is a corrupt Russian puppet, and you get a fair bit of blowback, but nothing like what you get if you say that returning to the gold standard would be a bad idea, or that monetary easing isn't necessarily inflationary. A lot of people on the right just go crazy at any suggestion that money is something to be managed, not treated as a sacred trust with which mortals must not meddle.
The only thing I know that brings comparable blowback is criticism of Bitcoin, a topic that combines some of the same libertarian derp with a hefty infusion of technobabble.
And the right's emotional response to Fed policy -- its hatred for using the printing press to boost the economy, no matter what the circumstances -- always seemed real to me. I never believed that Paul Ryan really cared about the deficit, but I did believe his assertion that his views on monetary policy were derived from the denunciation of paper money as a form of looting in Ayn Rand's "Atlas Shrugged."
Furthermore, the view that printing money is always a terrible thing seemed extremely durable, despite an uninterrupted track record of predictive failure. People who warned about looming inflation in 2009 continued to warn about it year after year, even as it kept not happening.
Then Trump decided to pressure the Fed, and many of the erstwhile hard-money men became easy-money men overnight. I mean that more or less literally. Consider the case of Kevin Warsh, a former member of the Federal Reserve Board who was for a time considered a likely Fed chairman. Up until two months ago he was always for higher interest rates -- but this week he suddenly wrote an op-ed article calling on the Fed to stop rate hikes.
There is, by the way, a reasonable case (which I accept) that the Fed should, indeed, pause its campaign of raising rates, and even that this week's hike was a mistake. But this case should be made on the basis of fundamental economic principles, not in pursuit of short-term political advantage, and least of all because it's what Donald Trump wants.
Yet that's how it's going. These days the G.O.P. is all about power; there are no principles it will adhere to if they involve any political cost. And it's a party that belongs to Trump: What he says is the party line, on any and every issue.
Trumpism, it turns out, trumps everything else -- even Ayn Rand.

Full text: KADI, India -- Vikram Singh is accustomed to life under the tyranny of elements he cannot control, from rains that do not fall to insects that tear at his crops. Lately one unchanging trouble is plaguing his family -- rising prices.
"Everything has gone up," Mr. Singh said on a recent afternoon, as his family members plucked a meager cotton harvest on their one-acre patch of earth in the Indian state of Gujarat. He rattled off the items that cost more: the lentils that are a staple of his family's diet; the cotton-oil cakes they feed to their dairy cows. Fertilizer. Diesel fuel for their tractor. Clothing, and school fees for the four children.
Across this nation of more than 1.3 billion people, as in many of the world's developing countries, versions of such tribulations are diminishing fortunes.
The strain of higher prices reflects a global change in sentiment as the United States Federal Reserve -- known, not for nothing, as the central bank for the world -- steadily lifts interest rates, as it did on Wednesday. Investors have been pulling money out of riskier, developing countries and entrusting it to safer, more established economies like the United States. That has sent the value of currencies plunging from Argentina to Turkey to India, making basic goods more expensive for households and businesses, while amplifying debts.
"Farmers are losing money," Mr. Singh said. "We just survive. We are earning less and spending more."
As money abandons emerging markets, commercial activity is slowing, magnifying concerns about a broader deceleration of growth in the global economy. Such worries have been adding to troubles in stock markets around the world, including the United States, with investors absorbing the likelihood of leaner times.
The change in the flow of money has been engineered in part by people in Washington, some 8,000 miles away from Mr. Singh's farm in western India. The American central bank has been raising interest rates, ending the era of ultracheap money unleashed a decade ago as the world plunged into the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.
Back when rates were effectively zero, investors scoured the globe for higher returns, placing big bets on high-risk, high-reward countries -- India among them -- propping up the value of currencies. With the Federal Reserve now reversing course, money has been washing back to the United States, bolstering the American dollar, while depressing many emerging market currencies.
Last year, global investors delivered $315 billion in fresh capital to the stock and bond markets of emerging economies, not counting China, according to an analysis by Oxford Economics in London. This year, the flow dropped to $105 billion through October. Many economies have seen outright reversals, with Turkey, Argentina, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and South Africa all seeing overall declines.
"You have the perfect cocktail of risks for emerging markets," said Nafez Zouk, Oxford's lead emerging markets economist.
This turnaround has exposed many countries to a painful reckoning, contributing to full-blown crises in Turkey and Argentina. There, precipitous plunges in currencies have left companies that borrowed in dollars staring at impossible debts. Argentina was forced to accept a $50 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund.
India is in no imminent danger. Official data shows the economy expanding at well over a 7 percent annual clip, though the pace is slowing. The official inflation rate, below 4 percent, is not flashing emergency.
But beneath these headline figures are significant troubles that are prompting money to leave India, applying pressure to families and businesses. Given that India imports more goods than it exports, the effects are potent. Any increase in cost, any factor discouraging companies from hiring, strains a country in which one in five people survive on no more than $1.90 per day, according to the World Bank.
"India is a country that is very vulnerable to the fallout to the readjustment of global interest rates," said Joseph E. Stiglitz, a Nobel laureate economist at Columbia University, and a former chief economist at the World Bank.
India imports more than 80 percent of its oil. Though the price of Brent crude oil -- the global benchmark -- has plummeted over the last two months, it has more than doubled since early 2016. Oil is priced in dollars. Its increase, combined with a 10 percent decline in the value of the rupee this year, have lifted the cost of petroleum-based products, from fuel to chemicals, used by key parts of Indian industry.
Concerns are mounting about rising debt levels as the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi unleashes spending aimed at winning popular support ahead of next year's elections. Worries fester over bad loans choking a banking system still dominated by the government.
Doubts about India's economic vigor have been enhanced as Mr. Modi's government has sniped with the Reserve Bank of India, suggesting it should hand over some of its cash to finance public spending. The drama has resonated as an attack on the central bank's independence, an impression only enhanced this month by the sudden resignation of the bank's governor, Urjit Patel.
All of this has combined to prompt investors to yank their money out of India, pushing the rupee down.
In Gujarat, Mr. Modi's home state, and a center of business, many local industries require imports to make their wares -- especially petroleum products. Gujarat's largest city, Ahmedabad, a dusty, traffic-choked metropolis of six million people, is home to factories that produce plastics, from packaging materials to the film covering greenhouses.
Many of the necessary petroleum products have risen in price by as much as 35 percent. At the same time, a glut of plastics factories worldwide has prevented producers from raising prices, hurting profit margins.
"We are very much affected," said Jigish Doshi, president of the Plastindia Foundation, an alliance of plastic industry trade groups that collectively represent more than 50,000 plastics companies across India.
Mr. Doshi's own company, the Vishakha Group, makes plastic pipes used for irrigation. The fall in the rupee has lifted the cost of the raw materials by 15 percent over the last year. "We are slowing our production," he said.
Gujarat is also a major source of dyes used for coloring textiles and plastic household goods. The fall in the rupee has supplied Indian exporters a competitive advantage, reducing the price of their wares in dollar terms.
So has the Trump administration's tariffs on Chinese goods. Indian companies are gaining orders from American manufacturers seeking alternatives to Chinese suppliers, said Bipin Patel, a director at Jay Chemical Industries Ltd., which operates four dye-making factories in Ahmedabad and exports to some 75 countries.
But the raw materials used to make dyes have risen in price, cutting Jay Chemical's profit margin in half. That trend may still be unfolding.
"The rupee is unsustainable," said Sebastian Morris, an economist at the Indian Institute of Management in Ahmedabad. "It can fall quite a bit more."
At a Mercedes dealership in the center of Ahmedabad, where the most expensive model, the Maybach S 650 sedan, sells for 35 million rupees (more than $486,000), sales staff fret that the weaker rupee has inflated the costs of the vehicles. The top models are imported from factories in Germany.
Two blocks away, on a patch of garbage-strewn dirt within view of the dealership's spinning Mercedes logo, some 600 people live without electricity in shacks fashioned with boards, plastic tarps and sheets of corrugated aluminum. Women scrub pots using water delivered once a day by a municipal tanker. Children pound sticks in the dirt for lack of toys.
Most of the families are migrants from villages who survive as so-called ragpickers, earning less than $3 a day as they scour city streets for discarded materials they can sell -- plastic bottles, scraps of paper, pieces of metal.
Laxman Gohel, a 38-year-old father of two, saved enough from ragpicking to open a tea shop. He boils water over a charcoal fire, making sales of about 1,500 rupees a day (about $21). But the price of charcoal has more than doubled over the last year, leaving him with perhaps 300 rupees in daily profit. He cannot pass on the costs.
"These poor people cannot pay me more," he said.
Across an alleyway, Shahbaz Ansari, 17, works part time repairing truck tires at his father's roadside stall. He is in his final year of high school. After graduation, he imagines a job inside an air-conditioned office.
Mr. Gohel scoffed. "Do you have money to pay a bribe to get a job?" he said. "Nobody gets a job after 12th grade."
Even the children of middle-class homes worry about declining opportunities.
As they sipped fresh juice procured from a sidewalk stand, four students enrolled in a three-year college program in business administration expressed fears that the program may not deliver them to their desired management jobs.
"The rupee is falling day by day," said Vatsal Thakkar, 18. "Wages are falling, so I'm thinking about going to Canada."
Thirty miles northwest of Ahmedabad in the town of Kadi, the Singh family's fortunes are firmly tethered to their land.
Last year, torrential rains destroyed their cotton cop. This year, an insect infestation has cut it by half.
On a recent afternoon, Mr. Singh's wife, Sonal Ben, stood in the 95-degree heat, pulling puffs of cotton from the plants that have flowered, and depositing them into plastic bags. Mr. Singh will use his tractor to haul the crop to a trader in town.
The diesel that fuels his vehicle has increased in price by one-fifth. Yet when he brings his crop to market, he cannot recoup the additional costs.
"The traders decide on the price," he said. "I don't decide."
The traders themselves insist they are themselves at the mercy of global forces, accepting whatever price is dictated by commodity pits from New York to São Paulo.
"Now, we are losing money," said Prahlad Bhai Patel, owner of a cotton mill in Kadi.
Ordinarily, Mr. Patel's company sells half the product to domestic factories that spin cotton, and exports the other half to China, Bangladesh, Vietnam and Pakistan.
Lately, he just piles up bales at a loading dock, waiting for better days. The price for his exports is now too low to cover his costs, he said.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday and signaled that it expects additional rate increases next year in a display of measured confidence in the economy that came despite financial market worries and political pressure to suspend rate increases.
Jerome H. Powell, the Fed's chairman, emphasized the continued strength of economic growth at a news conference after the announcement. He acknowledged new strains in recent months, including weaker growth in Europe and China and a downturn in stock prices, and he said the Fed expects slightly slower domestic growth and fewer rate increases next year.
But he strongly defended the Fed's decision to increase rates.
"We think this move was appropriate for what is a very healthy economy," Mr. Powell said.
Mr. Powell's remarks were described by one analyst as a dose of "tough love" for financial markets.
Mr. Powell insisted on the wisdom of the Fed's plans to raise borrowing costs while investors dumped their holdings. Stock prices fell when the Fed released its policy statement at 2 p.m., and dropped again as Mr. Powell spoke. The S&P 500 was down 1.5 percent on the day and is now down 6 percent on the year.
[Here's what a rate increase means for your wallet.]
The Fed's decision also rebuffed President Trump, who has broken with the practice of his predecessors by loudly and publicly campaigning for the Fed to keep rates low to continue stimulating the economy. "Feel the market, don't just go by meaningless numbers," Mr. Trump urged in a tweet earlier on Tuesday.
Asked about Mr. Trump's advice, Mr. Powell said it "played no role" in the Fed's decision.
"Nothing will deter us from doing exactly what we think is the right thing to do," he said.
The decision to raise rates for the fifth consecutive quarter, by a unanimous vote of the Federal Open Market Committee, amounted to a rejection of the view that the Fed should continue to stimulate the economy in the hope of increasing employment and wage gains. The benchmark rate will now sit in a range from 2.25 percent to 2.5 percent, abutting the lower end of what Fed officials consider the neutral zone: the region in which rates would neither stimulate nor restrain the economy.
"Policy at this point does not need to be accommodative," Mr. Powell said of that milestone.
The Fed's announcement offered a few crumbs for critics. In previous statements, the Fed had said it planned "further gradual increases" in its benchmark rate, conveying to investors that additional increases were expected. Wednesday's statement sought to recalibrate those expectations by adding the word "some" to the beginning of the phrase, suggesting that rates may not rise much higher.
A majority of Fed officials predicted on Wednesday that the central bank would raise rates no more than twice next year. In September, most Fed officials had predicted at least three rate increases.
Mr. Powell tried to emphasize that the Fed would continue to keep a close eye on economic conditions and said that the ultimate pace of rate increases was "not predetermined." He has said the Fed's goal is to strike a balance between extending the expansion and maintaining control of inflation.
But the overall tone of the statement suggested the Fed continues to regard the strength of economic growth as more impressive than any storm clouds on the horizon, including a trade war with China and geopolitical strains overseas. Companies continue to add jobs, the unemployment rate sits at 3.7 percent and wages are rising more quickly.
"Over the past year, the economy has been growing at a strong pace, the unemployment rate has been near record lows and inflation has been low and stable," Mr. Powell said. "All of those things remain true today."
Still, Mr. Powell noted that the robust expansion of 2018 would most likely moderate next year, and critics continued to raise questions about the Fed's steady march toward higher rates. It now appears likely that inflation will fall short of the Fed's 2 percent annual target for the seventh consecutive year. And Fed officials predicted on Wednesday that the central bank will miss the 2 percent target next year, too.
Low inflation is a sign of economic weakness and can be a problem in its own right, for instance by restricting the Fed's ability to reduce borrowing costs should the economy begin to falter.
"I think they will look back on this as a mistake," Josh Bivens, the director of research at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, said of the rate increase. "This threatens to snuff out the very beginning of wage gains that we've started to see recently in the data. The Fed should allow the expansion's gains to reach more broadly into the work force and get off the steady escalator of ever-higher interest rates."
Investors and some economists are increasingly concerned about the economic outlook, particularly as the sugar high from Mr. Trump's $1.5 trillion tax cut and spending increases wears off and as the president continues to press trade fights with most of the nation's major trading partners.
On Wednesday, a group of United States financial regulators -- which includes the Fed -- warned that the trade fight with China had the potential to "materially impact U.S. economic growth."
FedEx, a bellwether for the global economy, on Wednesday sharply reduced its profit outlook for 2019 and announced plans to cut jobs, citing a deterioration in demand for its shipping services.
Fred Smith, the company's chief executive, blamed the Trump administration's trade policies.
"Most of the issues that we're dealing with today are induced by bad political choices," Mr. Smith said, specifically citing Mr. Trump's decisions to impose tariffs on a wide range of foreign goods.
There are also signs that the Fed's march toward higher rates is weighing on sales of homes and autos.
"The era of low auto loan rates is clearly behind us," said Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive, which gathers data on the auto industry. Mr. Smoke said the average monthly payment on a new car in November was $567, a 5 percent increase over November 2017. "If rates are indeed even higher in 2019, the buyer pool for new vehicles could further decline," he said.
Mortgage rates, less directly tied to Fed policy, have also climbed, contributing to a recent softening in the sales of new and existing homes. The average interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 4.63 percent last week, up from 3.93 percent a year ago, according to Freddie Mac.
Mr. Powell said these developments "may signal some softening relative to what we were expecting a few months ago." He added that he was aware of the increasingly dour mood among business executives. A survey of corporate chief financial officers published by Duke University last week found that almost half expected the economy to enter a recession next year.
"There's a mood of concern, a mood of angst about growth going forward," Mr. Powell said.
But he said the impact on the economy so far appeared to be small.
"In our view, these developments have not fundamentally altered the outlook," Mr. Powell said.
He added that the United States economy "has continued to perform well" and that -- while overall financial conditions have tightened -- the Fed has only "modestly" lowered its projections as a result.
The bottom line, he said, is that the Fed intends to let circumstances dictate its decisions.
If the economy weakens, the Fed will raise rates more slowly, or stand still. If the economy continues to chug along, the Fed is likely to raise rates at least a few more times.
The Fed's forecasts are guesses, not promises. "There's a fairly high degree of uncertainty about both the path and the ultimate destination of any further increases," Mr. Powell said.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The challenge confronting the Federal Reserve as it meets this week is a tale of two economies. Wall Street investors are behaving as if the economic expansion is in grave danger, while the best available data show that the American economy has continued to grow at a healthy pace.
The disconnect is visible on other Wall Streets across the United States.
Dorice Soroka, who runs a small company at Wall Street and Myrtle Lane in Daytona Beach, Fla., said her revenue has finally reached the level she last saw in 2006. "And that was unhealthy growth," Ms. Soroka said of the years before the crisis. "This is much more healthy."
Peoples State Bank, on East Wall Street in Eagle River, Wis., also is prospering.
"Our market areas remain economically healthy," said Scott M. Cattanach, the president of PSB Holdings, which operates nine branches in central and northern Wisconsin. The bank recently reported that profits rose 28 percent in the third quarter, and demand for development loans remained strong in the fourth quarter.
Katy Brooks, the president of the Bend, Ore., Chamber of Commerce -- whose offices sit on Wall Street -- said the region's tech companies were trying to fill more than 400 vacancies.
The Fed on Wednesday is widely expected to recognize the continued strength of the economy by announcing a quarter-point increase in its benchmark interest rate after a two-day meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee. But the central bank also is expected to tip its hat to queasy investors by emphasizing that future rate increases will depend on continued economic growth.
That would amount to an acknowledgment that 2018 has been a very good year on Wall Streets across the United States -- but that there is growing reason to worry about the coming year.
"While the domestic economy remains healthy, the external backdrop has worsened," said Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays, referring to a recent weakening of international economic growth, particularly in Europe and China. Mr. Gapen said financial conditions in the United States had also tightened sufficiently for the Fed to worry about the broader economic effect.
Equity markets jitterbugged on Tuesday, rising and falling and rising again. The S&P 500 stock index closed the day up 0.01 percent. Oil prices continued to fall, and President Trump renewed his Twitter attacks on the Fed, urging it "feel the market" and not make "yet another mistake."
The expected rate increase, which would lift the benchmark rate into a range between 2.25 and 2.5 percent, would mark the fifth consecutive quarter that the Fed has moved to raise borrowing costs. The benchmark rate now sits close to the bottom of what most Fed officials regard as a neutral zone in which the Fed would neither be encouraging nor discouraging economic activity.
The Fed also will publish a set of economic projections by the members of the committee, which comprises the Fed's board of governors and the presidents of the 12 regional reserve banks. In the last round of forecasts, published in September, most Fed officials predicted the central bank would raise rates three times in 2019. Shaving those predictions would underscore the Fed's doubts about the economy's trajectory.
There is still a lot of good news. The economy has been expanding for almost a decade, the unemployment rate of 3.7 percent is the lowest in a half-century, job growth remains strong and wages are beginning to rise faster.
Consumer spending, the primary form of economic activity in the United States, has been growing at a healthy pace, up 0.6 percent in October. "What we know about Main Street is they're spending like banshees on Christmas stuff, and that's because we've seen a real increase in wages at the low end of the spectrum," said Diane Swonk, the chief economist at Grant Thornton.
But the good news is not great news, at least by historical standards. Some economists see evidence that there is still considerable slack in the labor market, and it appears increasingly likely that inflation will fall short of the Fed's 2 percent target for the seventh straight year.
Ms. Swonk, who expects the Fed to raise rates on Wednesday, said the central bank was trying to strike a delicate balance by wrapping up its post-crisis campaign to stimulate the economy by holding down interest rates to encourage consumer and business borrowing.
"There is good news, and that's what the Fed is acknowledging by raising rates," she said."They don't think that's going to crush the economy."
The fragility of the economy is visible in the anxiety of investors. Between 2004 and 2006, the Fed raised rates at 17 consecutive policy meetings -- from 1 to 5.25 percent -- without noticeably dampening the euphoria on Wall Street. In recent years, markets have treated each quarter-point increase in the Fed's benchmark rate as a significant threat to growth.
But the fragility is also visible far from New York's financial district.
Ms. Soroka, in Daytona Beach, runs a company that gathers information on development projects, allowing contractors and workers to identify potential opportunities.
The company, Builders Exchange and Reprographics, employed eight people before the crisis. Ms. Soroka cut half of those jobs during the crisis, and she has not hired anyone as revenue has recovered. In part, she said, technology has reduced her need for workers. Local governments increasingly post the information she needs on websites, eliminating the need for people to collect documents in person.
But Ms. Soroka said she also remained nervous about investing in her company. Even in the 10th year of an economic expansion -- one of the longest periods of growth in American history -- she said she was reluctant to spend on office decorations, or buy new equipment.
"I tiptoe into things," she said, "because I don't know how sustainable this is going to be."
The Fed's interest rate increases have added a new reason for anxiety. Higher borrowing costs appear to be pinching housing, as sales of new and existing homes have softened in recent months. The government reported Tuesday that housing starts increased in November, but the change was driven by a rise in multifamily construction, which tends to vary month to month.
Ms. Soroka said that developers in the Central Florida region that she watches closely are showing signs of increased caution. For example, she said, developers appear to be breaking projects into a larger number of phases, so the initial increment of construction is smaller. A developer might obtain permits for a 500-lot subdivision, she said, but begin with a section of 50 homes.
"I know a lot of business owners who are thinking about being a little more liquid, which means that money is not going into the economy," she said. "They're just holding it."

Full text: A record 45.7 million passengers are expected to fly on domestic airlines from Dec. 20 to Jan. 6. But unlike holiday seasons past, they are unlikely to be standing in nightmarishly long lines.
"My hope is this Christmas will be a better, less stressful, more hassle-free airport screening experience than last year," said Henry Harteveldt, founder of Atmosphere Research Group, a travel industry analysis firm in San Francisco.
Why? Better technology is one reason. The Transportation Security Administration has installed more effective equipment, like improved conveyor belts and 3-D scanning machines, which give screeners a better view of the contents of travelers' carry-on bags. The airlines and airports are testing biometric screening of passengers' passports or other photo IDs.
The airlines are also adding more flights on some of their busiest routes or switching to bigger planes to meet demand during the period.
And then, there are the dogs.
The T.S.A. is using more dogs trained to detect explosives. The dogs speed the security process because passengers have already been vetted for explosives by the time they reach the scanners. "They're a very important layer of security," an agency spokeswoman, Lisa Farbstein, said.
Of course, bad weather could throw a wrench into all the plans. But airlines also have an answer for that -- apps that they say will allow travelers to reschedule their flights more quickly than standing in line at the ticket counter.
The result should be smoother travel.
"The industry is not ignoring the challenge of this," Mr. Harteveldt said. "What I'm encouraged by is that steps are being taken, these new initiatives are being implemented and anything that can help move people through the screening faster is going to benefit everybody."
Multiple factors are responsible for the surge in passenger traffic, a 5.2 percent rise over the comparable period last season, industry analysts say. A robust economy with low unemployment and rising wages has given Americans more money and more confidence about spending that money.
"We're basically experiencing the impact of a strong economy," said Dan McKone, senior partner and head of the travel and transportation practice at L.E.K. Consulting. "While there's a lot of mixed indicators impacting the markets, the overall economy remains strong and air passenger growth tends to be most highly correlated with G.D.P.," he said.
While investors' concern about economic growth has led to volatility in the stock market in recent weeks, it has also contributed to the slide in global oil prices that has translated to lower gas prices for drivers and cheaper jet fuel.
"Jet fuel has decreased, although it was up as much as 30 to 40 percent earlier this year," Mr. Harteveldt said.
This is helping to keep ticket prices low, which also drives demand, especially among leisure travelers. According to data from the travel booking platform Hopper, round-trip domestic ticket prices for holiday flights are averaging $304, a drop of nearly 10 percent from last year. (Prices for international flights ticked up a bit, rising $66 on average.)
"If you actually look at the average price of tickets in real terms adjusted for inflation, air traffic continues to be more and more affordable," Mr. McKone said.
With ticket prices lower, more Americans will be flying, and Hopper estimates that overall spending will be 6 percent higher this holiday season than last. "Having lower prices definitely does drive demand," Mr. McKone said.
Airlines for America, the industry trade organization, estimates that domestic airlines will add, collectively, 143,000 seats daily to accommodate holiday travelers, and according to Patrick Surry, chief data scientist at Hopper, much of that capacity is being added by the major carriers at large hub airports.
Southwest Airlines, for instance, announced new routes last month in Northern California and the Washington, D.C., area, as well as to popular warm-weather vacation destinations. United Airlines, which expects to transport roughly half a million passengers -- a 4 percent increase over 2017 -- on its peak holiday travel days, is increasing the frequency of flights to locations like the Caribbean and ski resort areas, and plans to add nearly 20 domestic wide-body aircraft to help manage full flights over the holidays, an airline spokesman, Charlie Hobart, said.
The airline industry is looking to technology to help prevent bottlenecks and move travelers from check-in to gate to boarding more quickly -- not just for this holiday season, but into 2019 and beyond.
Last month, JetBlue installed its first biometric self-boarding gate at its Kennedy International Airport headquarters in New York. Instead of having passengers' IDs checked by gate agents, a camera takes a picture. The photo is sent to a United States Customs and Border Protection server to compare with that person's passport photo on file.
"They built the algorithm to compare those photos," said Caryl Spoden, JetBlue's head of customer experience. "Everything happens in two to three seconds," she said, adding that the photo taken at the gate is not saved or stored.
"It does remove the manual passport verification. That is a good time saver," she said. "It allows our crew members to interact with the customer in a more meaningful way."
Ms. Spoden said the inaugural machine will process around 500 passengers a day over the holidays. "Our intent is to expand this to every gate at J.F.K. and beyond," she said.
Delta Air Lines has been testing facial recognition boarding for the past two years, and this fall introduced its first biometric terminal at its Atlanta headquarters for travelers taking direct international flights on Delta or its code-share partners Aeromexico, Air France-KLM and Virgin Atlantic. Delta says the technology shaves nine minutes off boarding time per flight. American Airlines also started a biometric boarding program this month at Los Angeles International Airport, which will be tested and evaluated for a 90-day period.
In the interim, though, there are the dog noses.
The T.S.A. currently has roughly 1,000 dogs trained to detect explosives, and it trains about 350 new dogs a year. It also works with teams of K-9 handlers employed by state and local law enforcement agencies. Last month the agency announced an initiative to allow private companies that train and handle explosives-detecting dogs to provide security for cargo air traffic, freeing up more of the T.S.A.'s dogs to screen travelers.
Even though these early inroads into biometric and 3-D scanning technology will help speed the journeys of a relatively tiny subset of the nearly 46 million people expected to fly during the holidays, industry analysts say they will help airlines cope with the long-term growth in passenger traffic. "You're still seeing this trend where the price of flying is increasing at a lower rate than general income, so you have, every year, a huge number of people around the world who take their first plane trip," Mr. Surry, of Hopper, said.

Full text: LOS ANGELES -- The ecstatically reviewed "Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse" stuck its landing, likely starting a new animated franchise for Sony Pictures. And Clint Eastwood, playing a cranky drug courier in "The Mule," proved that he is still an incredibly bankable star, even at nearly 90 years old.
But it was a calamitous weekend at the North American box office for Peter Jackson, whose name did little for "Mortal Engines," which arrived as one of the biggest flops of the year.
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," heralded for its inventive animation and clever use of multiple Spideys, was the No. 1 movie in the United States and Canada. It collected about $35.4 million at 3,813 theaters, according to Comscore, which compiles box-office data. Sony spent roughly $90 million to make the movie, not including substantial marketing costs. The PG-rated film was produced by a team that included Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, the duo behind "The Lego Movie."
[Read A. O. Scott's review: A fresh take on "Spider-Man"]
Ticket buyers agreed with critics, giving "Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse" an A-plus grade in CinemaScore exit polls.
"The Mule" (Warner Bros.), which Mr. Eastwood also directed, took in an estimated $17.2 million, one of the best initial results for an original drama this year. That total, enough for second place, gave Mr. Eastwood his biggest opening as a star since 2000, when "Space Cowboys" arrived to $18.1 million, or roughly $27 million after adjusting for inflation.
"The Mule," which cost $50 million to make, is expected to do well over the busy holiday period, in part because it will have little direct competition; studios are mostly planning to serve up fantasies heavy on computer-generated imagery.
Speaking of which: "Mortal Engines" (Universal), a futuristic fantasy involving giant, predator cities that roll on wheels, collected an estimated $7.5 million -- a terrible result for a film that cost Media Rights Capital and Universal at least $100 million to make, not including marketing.
"Mortal Engines" was directed by Christian Rivers from a script by Mr. Jackson, Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens, the Oscar-winning trio behind the "Lord of the Rings" and "Hobbit" movies. Universal used the screenwriters' connection with fantasy fans in its marketing campaign. Mr. Rivers, a first-time feature filmmaker, also worked on those blockbusters; he is one of Mr. Jackson's longtime storyboard and visual effects artists.
"Mortal Engines," which received poor reviews, has taken in an additional $35 million in release overseas.

Hi there! Here you are, rushing around with too many plans, not enough holiday shopping done and perhaps a mild headache from last night's mulled wine. The least we can give you is a quick rundown of what's going on in the business world. If you like what you're reading and haven't already subscribed, click here -- and then forward to a friend if you're feeling generous.
Speaking of the holiday season, are you one of the 45.7 million Americans planning to fly in the next two weeks? If so, keep an ear out: Customs officials at Kennedy Airport have intercepted almost 200 live finches (70 last week alone) that were smuggled on flights from Guyana. Once in the United States, the birds compete in chirping competitions, and a winner can fetch up to $10,000. While we do not condone any illegal behavior, in the grand scheme of sounds to be heard on a plane, a finch sounds downright pleasant.
______
DEC. 9-15
What's Up?
A Bigger Apple in Your Backyard
Want a shot at an Apple employee discount? Now may be your moment. Apple announced plans on Thursday to invest $1 billion in a slick new campus in Austin, Tex. It will eventually bring 15,000 jobs to the area, while additional offices in Seattle, San Diego and Culver City, Calif., each plan to hire more than 1,000 employees. For years, Apple has been under fire for relying heavily on China for its product manufacturing, and this announcement makes good on its recent promise to expand operations in the United States. Other tech giants like Amazon and Google have made similar moves to expand their domestic work force in the past few months.
No Brexit Deal in Sight
Consider popping over to England for some holiday shopping -- you'll get a good deal on your dollar, as the British pound fell last week to its lowest value in a year and half. That's only one symptom of the instability brought on by Britain's floundering attempts to extricate itself from the European Union. On Tuesday, Prime Minister Theresa May -- whose name is almost impossible to say without the word "embattled" before it -- postponed the parliamentary vote on her Brexit proposal, which was clearly headed for defeat. Now, having survived a no-confidence vote, she's back to the drawing board with exasperated European leaders, who have expressed little to no interest in renegotiating.
China's Growth Falters
Trade tensions with China eased slightly as President Xi Jinping began to lift new barriers to American imports like cars and food (phew). But the dispute is far from over, and China's economy is showing signs of stress, weakened by mounting debt and the Trump administration's tariffs. On Friday, Chinese officials reported bleak numbers for monthly sales and industrial production, jolting markets around the globe. Auto sales have also plunged, and some factories are sending workers off for the Lunar New Year holiday two months early.
DEC. 16-22
What's Next?
The Rate Question
Don't be surprised by a tremor in the markets this Wednesday -- it's just the Federal Reserve making its last interest rate decision of the year. The Fed is expected to raise benchmark rates by another quarter point, and to do so twice more in 2019. Officials hope to stem inflation and keep the economy solid as it grows over the long run, but these upticks affect home buyers and other borrowers most acutely in the short term: Higher interest rates on mortgages and other loans can add up, and quickly. President Trump has made no secret of his distaste for rate increases of any amount, and blamed this fall's market volatility on the Fed's choice to impose them.
Build the Wall or Bust?
So much for Washington going quietly into the holiday break. Funding for parts of the federal government will expire this Friday unless Congress and Mr. Trump can agree on legislation to keep the lights on. In an awkward televised spat with the Democratic congressional leaders, Representative Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer, the president said he would be "proud to shut down the government" if the funding bill did not include $5 billion for his proposed southern border wall -- which he has repeatedly said that Mexico would pay for, but never mind. Democrats have agreed to dedicate funds to border security, but not enough for the wall.
The Ghost of Ghosn
While Nissan's former chairman, Carl Ghosn, sits in jail, awaiting trial on charges of financial misconduct, the future of his auto empire (the alliance of Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors) is in limbo. Nissan's stock has dropped 9 percent in recent weeks, and its board members are meeting on Monday to attempt to appoint a new chairman. It's unlikely that they will agree on one. They'll also set a date for a shareholder vote to oust Mr. Ghosn from the board altogether. Rather awkwardly, Renault has stuck by Mr. Ghosn, and he remains chief executive. So much for an alliance.
______
What Else?
Federal prosecutors are examining the finances of Mr. Trump's 2017 inauguration committee and a pro-Trump super PAC to determine whether foreigners illegally funneled money to both in hopes of buying influence over American policy. Also, the tabloid publisher American Media Inc. admitted to participating in a hush-money scheme intended to protect Mr. Trump during his 2016 presidential campaign. Speaking of settlements, CBS paid the actress Eliza Dushku $9.5 million after she spoke up about sexual harassment on the set of TV drama "Bull" and was written off the show, adding to the list of sexual misconduct issues at the network.
What Counts
100 euros: An increase to the monthly minimum wage in France, as promised by President Emmanuel Macron this week, in an effort to quell the Yellow Vest protests. France's current monthly minimum wage is 1,498.5 euros, or a little over $1,700.

Full text: For moneyed Americans, most of the past year has felt like 1929 all over again -- the fun, bathtub-gin-quaffing, rich-white-people-doing-the-Charleston early part of 1929, not the grim couple of months after the stock market crashed.
After a decade-long stock market party, which saw the stocks of the S. & P. 500 index create some $17 trillion in new wealth, the rich indulged in $1,210 cocktails at the Four Seasons hotel's Ty Bar in New York, in $325,000 Rolls-Royce Cullinan sport-utility vehicles in S.U.V.-loving Houston and in nine-figure crash pads like Aaron Spelling's 56,000-square-foot mansion in Los Angeles (currently on the market for $175 million, more than double what it fetched just five years ago).
Will it last? Who knows. But in recent months, the anxiety that we could be in for a replay of 1929 -- or 1987, or 2000, or 2008 -- has become palpable not just for the Aspen set, but for any American with a 401(k).
Overall, stocks are down 1.5 percent this year, after hitting dizzying heights in early October. Hedge funds are having their worst year since the 2008 crisis. And household debt recently hit another record high of $13.5 trillion -- up $837 billion from the previous peak, which preceded the Great Recession.
After a decade of low interest rates that fueled a massive run-up in stocks, real estate and other assets, financial Cassandras are not hard to find. Paul Tudor Jones, the billionaire investor, recently posited that we are likely in a "global debt bubble," and Jim Rogers, the influential fund manager and commentator, has forewarned of a crash that will be "the biggest in my lifetime" (he is 76).
What might prove the pinprick to the "everything bubble," as doomers like to call it? Could be anything. Could be nothing. Only time will tell if the everything bubble is a bubble at all. But, just a decade after the last financial crisis, here are five popular doom-and-gloom scenarios.
Happy holidays!
5. Student Debt
Remember how the 2008 crisis was triggered by a bunch of people, who probably should not have been lent giant amounts of money in the first place, not making their mortgage payments? That was just the precipitating factor, but go back and stream "The Big Short" if none of this rings a bell.
Then fast-forward to 2018, where bad mortgages may not be the problem. Consider, instead, the mountain of student debt out there, which is basically a $1.5 trillion bet that a generation of underemployed young people will ever be able pay off a hundred grand in tuition loans in an economy where even hedge funders are getting creamed. Already, a lot of them aren't paying and can't pay. In a climate where "there are massive amounts of unaffordable loans being made to people who can't pay them," as Sheila Bair, the former head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, described the student debt problem in Barron's earlier this year, nearly 20 percent of those loans are already delinquent or in default. That number could balloon to 40 percent by 2023, according to a report earlier this year by the Brookings Institution.
Now, lots of that debt is owed the federal government, so it's unlikely to poison the banking system, as mortgages did a decade ago. But this burden of debt is already beginning to wipe out the next generation of home buyers and auto purchasers. As a result, a generation of well-educated and underemployed millennials, told to value a college education above all, could drag down an economy that never seemed to want them in the first place.
4. China
You know who has racked up even more debt than hopeful 20-something ceramics-studies grads in the United States? Here's a hint: It's a not-exactly-Communist country in Asia that has been on such a wild debt-fueled building spree that it somehow used more cement in just three years earlier this decade than the United States did in the entire 20th century. Think about that. Now think about it some more. Over the past decade, China devoted mountains of cash to build airports, factories and entire would-be cities -- now known as "ghost" cities, since the cities are populated by largely empty skyscrapers and apartment towers -- all in the name of economic growth. And grow it did.
The result is a country with a supersized population (1.4 billion people) and supersized debt. Where things go from here is anyone's guess. Optimists might argue that those trillions bought a 21st-century Asian equivalent of the American dream. Pessimists describe that massive debt as a "mountain," a "horror movie," a "bomb" and a "treadmill to hell," all in the same Bloomberg article. One thing seems certain, though: If the so-called "debt bomb" in China explodes, it's likely to sprinkle the global economy with ash. And with President Trump teasing a trade war that already seems to be threatening China's massive, export-based economy, we may have our answer soon.
3. The End of Easy Money
Say you lived in the suburbs, and one day your neighbor suddenly pulled up her driveway in a new $75,000 Cadillac Escalade. A week later, she was tugging a new speedboat. A few weeks after that, it was Jet Skis. You might either think, "Wow, she's rolling in it," or "Golly, she hates glaciers." (Hatred of glaciers may prove, actually, to be the real spark of the financial end times.) But what if it turned out that she bought all of those carbon-dioxide-spewing toys on credit, at crazy-low interest rates? And what if those rates suddenly started to spike? The result would likely be good news for the polar ice caps and bad news for her, when the repo man (not to cave to gender stereotypes about repo-persons) came calling.
O.K., overstretched metaphor alert: The "neighbor" is us. Ever since the Federal Reserve started printing money in the name of "quantitative easing" to pull us out of the last financial crisis, money has been cheap, and seemingly any American with a pulse and a credit line has been able to fake "rich" by bingeing on all sorts of indulgences -- real estate (despite tighter lending standards), fancy watches and awesome gaming systems, to say nothing of the debt that corporations were racking up, which some market analysts think might be the biggest threat of all.
The problem is: The whole system is now running in reverse. The Fed has been hiking rates and spooking markets in order to stave off inflation and other potential ills. Is this an overdue fit of fiscal sanity, or the equivalent of taking away the punch bowl just as the party was getting started, then dumping it on our heads?
There is at least one person at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue who thinks this could all end badly. "The United States should not be penalized because we are doing so well," Mr. Trump tweeted on July 20, just one of a series of broadsides against the current Fed policy, adding, "Debt coming due & we are raising rates - Really?"
2. Italexit
I know, it's a crazy thought: Imagine that a bunch of neighboring countries with wildly different languages, customs, values, and priorities somehow failed to get along? We don't have to rewind 70-something years to the last Pan-European shooting war. Just witness the continuing problems in the European Union. Ever since Britain voted to leave the union in the Brexit referendum of 2016, Europeans have been engaged in a dark parlor game, speculating on who might be next. Might it be a "Frexit" spurred by nationalists in France? A "Nexit" stoked by the anti-immigrant far right in the Netherlands? Lately, the fears have focused on Italy, where an "Italexit" -- or "Quitaly," if you can't help yourself -- has been bandied about by populist politicians as they threaten to abandon the euro, or leave the European Union altogether, over an ongoing tiff with European neighbors over deficit spending, migration and whatever else drums up votes.
The turmoil has already sent ripples through global markets during the past year. In recent months, Italian populists are still making veiled threats to break up the coalition, and the official denials are not 100 percent reassuring. Following the latest budget squabble with Brussels, the Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte told news reporters: "Read my lips: For Italy there is no chance, no way to get 'Italexit.' There is no way to get out of Europe, of the eurozone." Was he aware that "read my lips" is American political shorthand for a "broken promise"?

Full text: Stocks? Messy. Bonds? Meh. Commodities? Not pretty.
Most years, financial markets are a mixed bag. A bad year for risky investments, like stocks, might be a great one for safe bets like government bonds. Or, if worries about inflation are hurting bond investments, commodities like gold tend to do well.
Not this year.
For the first time in decades, every major type of investment has fared poorly, as the outlook for economic growth and corporate profits is dampened by rising trade tensions and interest rates. Stocks around the world are getting pummeled, while commodities and bonds are tumbling -- all of which have left investors with few places to put their money.
If this persists, or grows worse, it could create a damaging feedback loop, with doubts about the economy hurting the markets, and trouble in the markets undermining growth.
Pessimism emanating from the stock market could leave consumers and businesses scared to spend. The rout in junk bonds makes it more expensive for financially fragile businesses to borrow. The collapse in crude oil prices discourages new investment and hiring in the oil patch, which has been a source of job growth.
In that sense, the markets are both a gauge of what investors expect to happen in the economy, and a potential catalyst for their decisions. The mood in the financial markets ultimately feeds into spending by companies and consumers, and if they pull back, based on panicky ups and downs, growth could suffer.
"People look to the financial markets as a source of information, as a signal, about what's going to happen and what's going to come," said Itay Goldstein, finance professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. "And when they see markets going down, they start thinking pessimistically about the outlook for the real economy."

There's scant evidence that the worst-case scenario will play out. The American economy remains strong: Unemployment is near 50-year lows, and growth is steady. And it wasn't that long ago that financial markets were feeling good about the global economy, shrugging off troublesome issues like the trade war, Britain's exit from the European Union and the debt levels of developing nations.
On Sept. 20, stock investors in the United States were sitting on a nearly 10 percent gain for the year. Benchmark American crude oil prices were up more than 20 percent. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index was up more than 15 percent.
But those profits are gone.
Since October, an index of commodities that includes oil and copper has swung from gains of 20 percent to losses for the year. A similar move took place in risky corporate bonds. So far this year, after another steep drop on Friday, the S&P 500-stock index is down about 2.8 percent.
[Read more: The stock market has wiped out its 2018 gains. There have been several moments like this in the last decade.]
"In a typical year there's going to be some winners and losers," said Ed Clissold, chief United States strategist at the equity market research firm Ned Davis Research. "It's very rare that you get nothing working."
His firm recently looked at eight types of investments going back to 1972. In every year, at least one of these categories generated a return of 5 percent or more. A separate study by JPMorgan Chase analysts found that "2018 has delivered losses on almost every asset class and investing style."
The widespread market jitters have accompanied a tectonic shift in the investing world, as central banks have begun to withdraw the extraordinary support provided to the global economy in response to the financial crisis a decade ago.
For nearly seven years, the Federal Reserve kept interest rates near zero and bought trillions of dollars' worth of government bonds, which pushed interest rates -- that move in the opposite direction of prices -- sharply lower. Money in the bank earned next to nothing, so investors eagerly bought anything they expected to generate some kind of return: risky debt, real estate, stocks, technology start-ups.
The Fed's support, bolstered by similar efforts from the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank, proved to be a huge tailwind for global financial markets. Everything seemingly moved up in tandem.
Now the opposite appears to be unfolding, as the Fed pulls back. The American central bank has raised interest rates eight times since December 2015, and is expected to do so again this coming week. This year alone, it has shrunk its stockpile of bonds by roughly $370 billion. On Thursday, the European Central Bank said it was ending its crisis intervention, called quantitative easing.
"What was once a tailwind is now a headwind for markets," said Dan Ivascyn, group chief investment officer at Pimco, a bond investment firm with $1.7 trillion under management, in Newport Beach, Calif.
At least on the margins, the turmoil in the financial markets is already reverberating in the real economy.
For instance, as Treasury bond prices have declined this year, interest rates -- which move in the opposite direction -- have risen.
Those Treasury yields serve as the basis for a range of consumer borrowing rates, such as on mortgages. With the 30-year fixed mortgage rate rising above 5 percent this year, activity in the housing market has slumped, sending the stock prices of homebuilders sharply lower. The S&P 1500 index of home building stocks is down more than 30 percent this year.
In recent weeks, the broad investment declines have worsened while anxiety grows over the trade war between the United States and China. This fight, between the world's two largest economies, may already be dragging on global growth.
Economic data this month showed that Chinese trade slowed sharply in November, with imports of key metals such as copper and iron ore declining from the same month last year. On Friday, Chinese officials reported weak growth in monthly retail sales and industrial production. The numbers point to a deepening slowdown for the industrial heart of the world's No. 2 economy. Weak demand from China has roiled commodities, which are on track for their worst year since 2015.
The experience of 2015 could be a useful road map for investors. That year was uncomfortable as the Federal Reserve planned to raise interest rates against a backdrop of soft global growth. Stocks, corporate bonds and commodities all fell, while Treasury bonds eked out a minuscule gain.
In the midst of the market turmoil, the Federal Reserve slowed down the pace of its interest rate increases. And the pause from the central bank reinvigorated risk-taking among investors, with the S&P 500 rising 9.5 percent the next year, and the economy continuing to grow.
That's all to say, investors can be quick to jump to conclusions. But they can also be wrong.
"They're like people reading a book," said Jurrien Timmer, director of global macro at the asset manager Fidelity Investments in Boston. "But they're going to skip five chapters to see how the book ends."

Market Swings at Their Highest Level Since 2011
Stocks across Wall Street are enduring one of the most prolonged periods of turbulent trading of the last decade. So far this year, there have been 12 instances of the S&P 500 moving at least 3 percent from its intraday low to its high, according to data from Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst for S&P Dow Jones Indices. Four of those swings were greater than 4 percent.
This figure is the most in a single year since 2011, when the European debt crisis flared up and Standard & Poor's cut its rating on United States government debt.
The pickup in volatility this year has accelerated in recent months, as worries about trade, global growth and interest rates keep investors on edge. More than half of the 3-percent swings have come since the most recent sell-off began in early October. And the average intraday swing this month is the highest level for a month since January 2016.
This year's increase in volatility isn't necessarily unusual. Over the last 56 years, the S&P 500 has averaged nearly 10 intraday swings of 3 percent or more a year. And this year's 99 moves of 1 percent or more are well below the 169 the index has averaged since 1962. STEPHEN GROCER

GM Saves Jobs for Workers to Be Laid Off
General Motors' plans to lay off 14,000 salaried and blue-collar workers might not be as bad as originally projected.
The company said Friday that 2,700 out of the 3,300 American factory jobs slated for elimination will now be saved. Blue-collar workers will still lose jobs at four United States plants slated for closure next year, but most will be able to find employment at other GM factories where jobs are being added. Some would have to move.
GM still plans to lay off about 8,000 white-collar workers and another 2,600 factory workers in Canada.
In November, the company announced plans to end production at the American factories and one in Ontario as part of a major restructuring designed to cut costs and divert resources to development and manufacturing of trucks, SUVs and electric and autonomous vehicles.
While some of the 3,300 American factory workers will retire, most of the rest will be offered one of 2,700 jobs the company plans to add at factories where production will increase, GM announced on Friday. Some would have to move to other cities for jobs. A.P.
ECONOMY
Consumer Spending Rises on Strong Holiday Sales
United States consumer spending gathered momentum in November as households bought furniture, electronics and a range of other goods, which could further allay fears of a significant slowdown in the American economy even as the outlook overseas continued to darken.
The upbeat data from the Commerce Department on Friday bolstered expectations that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates for a fourth time this year at its Dec. 18-19 policy meeting, despite moderating inflation and tighter market conditions.
It also stood in contrast to reports from China showing a huge falloff in retail sales and from Europe where a measure of business activity expanded at its slowest rate in four years. REUTERS

Full text: Bob Bergland, a Minnesota Democrat who as a liberal congressman and President Jimmy Carter's secretary of agriculture was a zealous advocate for America's consumers as well as its farmers, died on Sunday in his hometown, Roseau, Minn. He was 90.
Mr. Bergland's son, Franklyn, said he died at LifeCare Roseau Manor, a nursing home where he had resided recently.
A descendant of 19th century Norwegians who settled in the blizzard country of northern Minnesota, Mr. Bergland experienced poverty, unemployment and, as a young man, was forced to leave his farm and go to Florida to find work. Later, representing a vast, largely rural district in Congress from 1971 to 1977, and then as a member of the Carter cabinet until 1981, he spoke passionately about his hard-pressed constituents.
"I know what it's like to be poor," he told The New York Times in 1978. "I know those times when we lost a crop and couldn't find steady work around Roseau. I couldn't buy milk for my kids then. I'm terribly upset when people who don't know what they're talking about criticize the poor who are struggling and want to work."
In an era when small family farms were being gobbled up by agribusiness, and when soaring inflation was corroding the purchasing power of millions of Americans, Mr. Bergland angered many farmers by tempering his advocacy of farm subsidies and price supports, and offering evenhanded encouragements for inflation-weary consumers.
Are farmers and consumers natural enemies? It might seem a simple matter of logic: When farmers make more money for their products, consumers must pay more to get them. But things are never quite so simple when it comes to farmers and consumers, especially in the tangled politics that link them in the economic scheme of things.
"I regard the consumer as the farmers' customer, not his enemy," Mr. Bergland told The Times, compressing the conflict into a kind of brotherhood of interests. "And neither side is right every time in every argument."
As a practical matter, the secretary of agriculture may provide crop and land-use subsidies to farmers, promote price supports and grant farm loans in lean years. Contrary to popular assumption, however, the secretary is not simply a farmers' advocate, and has no mandate to assure the welfare of individual farmers.
"Compounding the secretary's problem with the farmers is the fact that while all farmers want profits, few of them can agree on what should be done to insure them," Seth S. King wrote in a New York Times Magazine profile of Mr. Bergland in 1978. "Mr. Bergland is like the man trying to stuff an inner tube into a tire casing. If he pushes in one part, another pops out."
Demanding higher price supports and calling unsuccessfully for a nationwide farm strike, hundreds of farmers invaded the nation's capital on tractors, camper vans and pickup trucks in 1979. They broke into the Department of Agriculture building and occupied Mr. Bergland's office, and wandered through the Capitol and confronted Mr. Bergland at a committee hearing.
"There's no quick fix or free lunch in this business," he told them. "It's not the role of the federal government to guarantee all farmers a profit year after year. We have the responsibility to keep agriculture productive and strong, but the nation does not have the responsibility of assuming all the risks of farming."
"Bob Bergland is a farmer and he understands this business," said Earl Hayes, a Kansas farmer and leader of a wheat growers' association. "But he's something of a hired man and he's had to temper his dealing with the budget boys. He's tried to be broad-minded, and this makes him look a little wishy-washy to some farmers."
As secretary of agriculture, Mr. Bergland directed a department of 83,000 employees whose work affected virtually every taxpayer and consumer in America. Its 9,000 inspectors guarded the cleanliness and quality of meats. It lent $30 million a year to farmers, issued crop reports that influenced markets; supervised subsidies, controlled the labeling of packaged foods and directed $9.3 billion in programs that provided food stamps to 15 million people and lunches at 95,000 schools.
Among his signature achievements, Mr. Bergland helped steer the Farm Act of 1977 through Congress. It created a grain reserve that became a primary weapon to flatten boom-and-bust cycles. Under the plan, the government paid farmers to store grain on their own farms, holding it during fat years when prices were low, and marketing it in lean years when supplies were low and prices rose.
Mr. Bergland also created an assistant secretary of agriculture to protect consumer interests, and named Carol Tucker Foreman, executive director of the Consumer Federation of America, to fill it. She was a tough adversary of food processors, meatpackers and, indirectly, of farmers, demanding true-weight labeling on food packages, ordering junk food off school lunches, tightening rules on preservatives and launching studies on carcinogens and dietary effects on health.
"It was my idea and my appointment," Mr. Bergland said. "The Agriculture Department is going to be all the people's department, not just the farmers."
Before leaving office, Mr. Bergland unveiled a study that drew a relatively rosy picture of the nation's agriculture. World demand for American grains had burgeoned, he said, and most of the price-depressing surpluses had been sold. He also said that food production was nearing capacity, and that family farms with annual incomes of about $150,000 were the most efficient.
Robert Selmer Bergland was born in Roseau, near Minnesota's Canadian border, on July 22, 1928, one of four children of Selmer Bennett Bergland, a garage mechanic, and the former Mabel Evans, a teacher. The parents soon bought and began working a 360-acre wheat farm. His father was a Populist who sometimes voted Republican.
Bob, as he was always called, and his siblings, Glen, Betty and Philip, worked long hours in all kinds of weather on the farm. He made light of a climate with "nine months of winter and three months of tough sledding."
After graduating from Roseau High School in 1946, Bob attended the University of Minnesota School of Agriculture on a scholarship. He finished the two-year course in 1948 and joined the Minnesota Farmers Union as a field rep, and became active in the National Farmers Union.
In 1950, he married Helen Grahn. They had seven children: Dianne, Linda, Stevan, Jon, Allan, Bill, and Franklyn.
Besides Franklyn, Mr. Bergland is survived by two other sons, Allan and Bill; two daughters, Dianne Dahl and Linda Vatnsdal; a brother, Glen; 13 grandchildren and numerous great-grandchildren.
The couple borrowed to buy a 280-acre wheat farm. After several bad-weather crop failures, he was unable to find work in the area. He moved his family to Florida and took seasonal jobs as a construction laborer and carpenter. Fired for union organizing, he returned to his farm in Minnesota and became a Farmers Union organizer.
In 1961, Orville L. Freeman, President John F. Kennedy's secretary of agriculture, named Mr. Bergland chairman of the Minnesota Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, an arm of the United States Department of Agriculture. Two years later, he was promoted to Midwest regional director of the service, a position he held for five years.
He lost his first race for Congress on the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party ticket in 1968, but upset a Republican in 1970 and was re-elected three times by increasing margins. He was named to the Cabinet before serving his last term.
In the House, he backed farmer, consumer and environmental causes. There was little surprise when President-elect Carter, a farmer, chose Mr. Bergland as agriculture secretary.
After his Washington years, Mr. Bergland was president of Farmland-Eaton World Trade in 1981-82. He then became executive vice president and general manager of the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association until his retirement in 1993.
In his days as agriculture secretary, when he was scolded by farmers as a consumer advocate, and by consumers as a farm advocate, he kept on his office wall a picture of an unhappy mule, who had tried to jump a fence but got only halfway over. The caption said, "You're damned if you do, and you're damned if you don't."

Full text: A Four-Bedroom Penthouse Outside Monterrey
$4.1 MILLION
This four-bedroom, four-and-a-half-bath penthouse is in San Pedro Garza García, an upscale suburb of Monterrey, the capital and largest city of the northeastern state of Nuevo León, Mexico. The 4,843-square-foot residence sits atop an undulating, mixed-used building named High Park, designed by the Mexico City-based firm Rojkind Arquitectos and completed in 2015.
The apartment, which occupies the building's 10th floor and roof, was formed by joining two penthouses for greater space and privacy. It includes an exclusive two-level roof deck that has a swimming pool and views of the Sierra Madre Oriental mountain range to the south.
The front door opens into a large living room with two seating and entertaining areas divided by a free-standing wall. Most of the furniture is from Roche Bobois, and the residence is being sold completely furnished, said the seller, Gil Stroming, a dance producer.
One side of the living room has a large, pale sectional and a bar topped with black marble, while the other side has a dark gray sectional, a television and a baby grand piano and drum set. The dark, wide-plank floors and earth-toned walls and furnishings give the interior a modern rustic aesthetic, while the floor-to-ceiling windows bathe it in natural light.
"It's an awesome space for parties," Mr. Stroming said of the penthouse.
There is a half bath near the entrance, as well as a guest bedroom with a large en suite bathroom. From the bar, a door leads to the generous master suite, which has a sitting area and large pull-down shades covering a wall of windows. The master bath, with marble floors, and bedroom share a private terrace.
Opposite the master suite, the dining room connects to an open kitchen with stainless-steel appliances and a granite countertop. Adjacent to the kitchen are an en suite guest bedroom and a small en suite staff bedroom, as well as a hallway with storage and a laundry area. On the other side of the dining room, a cozy lounging corner is accented with white bricks and dark beams, and outfitted with candles, throw pillows and a constellation of hanging ceiling bulbs. A sliding-glass door opens to an expansive terrace, with dining and lounging areas, offering views of Monterrey and the mountains in the distance.
The rooftop terrace includes an infinity pool on a raised deck, two hot tubs, a billiard table, a kitchen and several covered eating spaces. Two sets of stairs -- inside, near the front door, and outside, by the kitchen -- lead up from the penthouse.
The property comes with four below-ground parking spaces. The building has a gym, a billiard and game room, a bar, a sauna, and entertaining and catering spaces.
"It's a very high-end boutique building, so there's a lot of personal care," Mr. Stroming said.
Monterrey, Mexico's third-largest city, is known as the industrial and economic center of the country's northern region, as well as a hub for modern art and culture. The suburb of San Pedro Garza García, part of the Monterrey metropolitan area, offers a wealth of retail and restaurants, all a short walk from High Park. (The building itself includes two levels of retail spaces.) Barrio Antiguo, Monterrey's historic district, and the city center, with its museums and parks, are about five miles east, while Monterrey International Airport is about 20 miles away.
Market Overview
With a population of about 1.2 million in the city and 4.5 million in the greater metropolitan area, Monterrey is one of Mexico's largest and most active real estate markets, with some of its most expensive properties, agents said.
The state of Nuevo León, which is dominated by the city of Monterrey, saw more than 40,000 home sales between January and August of 2018 -- a huge portion of Mexico's approximately 145,000 sales nationwide during that period -- according to an October market report published by Realty World Mexico, an agency with offices across the country.
Buyers gravitated toward older and more affordable units, and also toward rental properties rather than purchases, in part because of rising inflation, said Jorge Paredes, the chief executive of Realty World Mexico and the report's author.
But Monterrey's luxury properties also performed well. Between January and August of this year, sales of the highest priced properties in Nuevo León increased more than 6 percent over the same period in 2017, Mr. Paredes wrote, while luxury sales dropped almost 8 percent across Mexico.
As the region's economy continues to develop, more executives are buying properties in Monterrey's best neighborhoods and suburbs, agents said. Most prized is San Pedro Garza García, just outside the city center, where real estate prices are among the highest in Mexico.
Gerardo Gutierrez, chief executive of Gerencia RED, a national real estate agency, said prices of luxury properties there typically range from $1 million to $6 million. Prices in desirable areas of Monterrey have increased sharply in the past two years, he said, from about $2,000 to $3,000 a square meter ($185 to $285 a square foot), because of rising demand.
Maria Fernanda Camacho Bermudez, managing director of Century 21 Camber, an agency in Monterrey, pointed to other high-end neighborhoods, including Las Estancias and La Herradura, within the city, and Las Misiones, a suburb. Luxury properties there go for about $1.24 million to $1.98 million, she said, while the average for the city is around $200,000.
The city's real estate stock has been shifting in recent years, she added, from predominantly "horizontal" designs to more "vertical" developments that include both residential and office towers.
Who Buys in Monterrey
There aren't many foreigners buying homes for vacation or retirement in Monterrey, agents said. And foreigners who move to the city for work usually do so on a contract basis, so they rent.
Ms. Bermudez estimated that only about 10 to 20 percent of her agency's buyers are from outside Mexico, noting that the number includes buyers of commercial, industrial and residential properties.
Mr. Gutierrez said about 15 percent of the luxury home buyers he sees in Monterrey are foreign, most of them from the United States, South Korea and China, usually relocating for work.
Buying Basics
There are restrictions on foreigners buying real estate within 50 kilometers (31 miles) of Mexico's coasts and 100 kilometers (62 miles) of its international borders, unless the property is bought through a trust. Monterrey, about 100 miles from the American border and 200 miles from the Gulf of Mexico, is not subject to those restrictions, but buyers must obtain a permit from the foreign affairs ministry, said Miguel Angel Valdes Faz, a partner with Arizpe, Valdes and Marcos, a Monterrey law firm. The process takes about a month.
Notaries handle real estate transactions, but he recommended hiring a bilingual attorney to ensure the title is clear. There are "small details that have to be looked at by a Mexican attorney, and very often a bilingual attorney will be more helpful with foreign individuals," he said.

Full text: We are, once again, experiencing one of the greatest housing booms in United States history.
How long this will last and where it is heading next are impossible to know now.
But it is time to take notice: My data shows that this is the United States' third biggest housing boom in the modern era.
Since February 2012, when the price declines associated with the last financial crisis ended, prices for existing homes in the United States have been rising steadily and enormously. According to the S&P/CoreLogic/Case-Shiller National Home Price Index (which I helped to create) as of September, the prices were 53 percent higher than they were at the bottom of the market in 2012.
That means, on average, a house that sold for, say, $200,000 in 2012 would bring over $300,000 in September.
Even after factoring in Consumer Price Index inflation, real existing home prices were up almost 40 percent during that period. That is a substantial increase in less than seven years.
In fact, based on my data, it amounts to the third strongest national boom in real terms since the Consumer Price Index began in 1913, behind only the explosive run-up in prices that led to the great financial crisis of a decade ago, and one connected with World War II and the great postwar Baby Boom.
The No. 1 boom occurred from February 1997 to October 2006, when real prices of existing United States homes rose 74 percent. This was a period of intense speculative enthusiasm -- for houses and for financial instruments based on mortgages as investments -- and it was also a time of great regulatory complacency. The term "flipping houses" became popular then. People exploited the boom by buying homes and selling them only months later at a huge profit.
That boom ended disastrously. Soaring valuations collapsed with a 35 percent drop in real prices for existing homes, ushering in the financial crisis that enveloped the world in 2008 and 2009.
The second greatest boom, from 1942 to 1947, had more benign consequences. Over this five-year interval, real prices of existing homes rose 60 percent.
Booms and busts are rooted in popular narratives with complex social-psychological roots. This boom centered on a war-induced housing shortage, an enormous increase in the number of new babies and families who would need housing after the war, and the 1944 G.I. Bill, which subsidized home-buying by veterans. Home prices did not fall significantly after this boom ended.
Today, signs of weakness in the housing market are being taken by some as a signal that the prices of single-family homes may fall soon, as they did sharply after 2006. The leading indicators, which include building permits and sales of both existing and new homes, have all been declining in recent months.
But with few examples of extreme booms, we cannot be sure what such indicators mean for the current market.
Low interest rates -- imposed by the Federal Reserve and other central banks in reaction to the financial crisis -- are the most popular culprit in the current boom. There is some apparent merit to this view, since these three biggest nationwide housing booms all included very low interest rates.
But the market reaction to interest rates is hardly immediate or predictable. The housing market does not react as directly as you might expect to interest rate movements. Over the nearly seven years of the current boom, from February 2012 to the present, all major domestic interest rates have increased, not decreased. So, while interest rates have been low, they have moved the wrong way, yet the boom has continued.
Another explanation is simple economic growth. But, as a matter of history, prices of existing homes -- as opposed to the supply of newly built homes -- have generally not responded to economic growth. There was only a 20 percent increase in real prices of existing homes in the 50 years from 1950 to 2000 despite a sixfold increase in real G.D.P.
The simplest narrative being given for the current boom is just that the 2008-2009 financial crisis and the so-called Great Recession are over and home prices are returning to normal.
But that explanation does not cut it either. In September they were 11 percent higher than at the 2006 peak in nominal terms, and almost as high in real terms. This is not a return to normal, but a market that appears to be rising to a record.
It is difficult to assess the contribution of President Trump to the current boom.
It is certainly less obvious than the role of President George W. Bush in the 1997-2006 boom. Mr. Bush extolled the benefits of "the ownership society" and in 2003 he signed the American Dream Downpayment Act, which subsidized home purchases. In his 2004 re-election bid he boldly asserted: "We want more people owning their own home." This seems to have contributed to an atmosphere of high expectations for home price increases.
The Trump administration's attitude toward housing is less clear. President Trump's slogan "Make America Great Again" has overtones of the "American dream." But provisions of his Tax Reform and Jobs Act of 2017 were unfriendly to homeowners.
Even without major further interest rate increases, there would seem to be a limit on how much the prices of existing homes can increase. After all, people must struggle to cover a range of living expenses, and builders are supplying fresh new offerings to compete with the existing houses on the market.
Perhaps the home price increases are now a self-fulfilling prophesy. As John Maynard Keynes argued in his 1936 "General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money," people seem to have a "simple faith in the conventional basis of valuation."
If the conventional basis is now that home prices are going up 5 percent a year, then sellers, who would otherwise have no idea what to ask for their houses, will just put a price based on this convention. And likewise buyers will not feel they are paying too much if they accept the convention. In the United States, we may believe that the process is all part of the "American dream."
It can't go on forever, of course. But when it will end isn't knowable. The data can't tell us when prices will level off, or whether they will plunge catastrophically. All we do know is that prices have been roaring higher at a speed rarely seen in American history.

What Straight-A Students Get Wrong

Full text: A decade ago, at the end of my first semester teaching at Wharton, a student stopped by for office hours. He sat down and burst into tears. My mind started cycling through a list of events that could make a college junior cry: His girlfriend had dumped him; he had been accused of plagiarism. "I just got my first A-minus," he said, his voice shaking.
Year after year, I watch in dismay as students obsess over getting straight A's. Some sacrifice their health; a few have even tried to sue their school after falling short. All have joined the cult of perfectionism out of a conviction that top marks are a ticket to elite graduate schools and lucrative job offers.
I was one of them. I started college with the goal of graduating with a 4.0. It would be a reflection of my brainpower and willpower, revealing that I had the right stuff to succeed. But I was wrong.
The evidence is clear: Academic excellence is not a strong predictor of career excellence. Across industries, research shows that the correlation between grades and job performance is modest in the first year after college and trivial within a handful of years. For example, at Google, once employees are two or three years out of college, their grades have no bearing on their performance. (Of course, it must be said that if you got D's, you probably didn't end up at Google.)
Academic grades rarely assess qualities like creativity, leadership and teamwork skills, or social, emotional and political intelligence. Yes, straight-A students master cramming information and regurgitating it on exams. But career success is rarely about finding the right solution to a problem -- it's more about finding the right problem to solve.
In a classic 1962 study, a team of psychologists tracked down America's most creative architects and compared them with their technically skilled but less original peers. One of the factors that distinguished the creative architects was a record of spiky grades. "In college our creative architects earned about a B average," Donald MacKinnon wrote. "In work and courses which caught their interest they could turn in an A performance, but in courses that failed to strike their imagination, they were quite willing to do no work at all." They paid attention to their curiosity and prioritized activities that they found intrinsically motivating -- which ultimately served them well in their careers.
Getting straight A's requires conformity. Having an influential career demands originality. In a study of students who graduated at the top of their class, the education researcher Karen Arnold found that although they usually had successful careers, they rarely reached the upper echelons. "Valedictorians aren't likely to be the future's visionaries," Dr. Arnold explained. "They typically settle into the system instead of shaking it up."
This might explain why Steve Jobs finished high school with a 2.65 G.P.A., J.K. Rowling graduated from the University of Exeter with roughly a C average, and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. got only one A in his four years at Morehouse.
If your goal is to graduate without a blemish on your transcript, you end up taking easier classes and staying within your comfort zone. If you're willing to tolerate the occasional B, you can learn to program in Python while struggling to decipher "Finnegans Wake." You gain experience coping with failures and setbacks, which builds resilience.
Straight-A students also miss out socially. More time studying in the library means less time to start lifelong friendships, join new clubs or volunteer. I know from experience. I didn't meet my 4.0 goal; I graduated with a 3.78. (This is the first time I've shared my G.P.A. since applying to graduate school 16 years ago. Really, no one cares.) Looking back, I don't wish my grades had been higher. If I could do it over again, I'd study less. The hours I wasted memorizing the inner workings of the eye would have been better spent trying out improv comedy and having more midnight conversations about the meaning of life.
So universities: Make it easier for students to take some intellectual risks. Graduate schools can be clear that they don't care about the difference between a 3.7 and a 3.9. Colleges could just report letter grades without pluses and minuses, so that any G.P.A. above a 3.7 appears on transcripts as an A. It might also help to stop the madness of grade inflation, which creates an academic arms race that encourages too many students to strive for meaningless perfection. And why not let students wait until the end of the semester to declare a class pass-fail, instead of forcing them to decide in the first month?
Employers: Make it clear you value skills over straight A's. Some recruiters are already on board: In a 2006 study of over 500 job postings, nearly 15 percent of recruiters actively selected against students with high G.P.A.s (perhaps questioning their priorities and life skills), while more than 40 percent put no weight on grades in initial screening.
Straight-A students: Recognize that underachieving in school can prepare you to overachieve in life. So maybe it's time to apply your grit to a new goal -- getting at least one B before you graduate.

Full text: A steep slide followed by a strong recovery whipsawed investors on Thursday, as concerns about the global economy, trade tensions and interest rates kept markets on edge.
Stocks fell around the world after the arrest of a top Chinese technology executive intensified concerns that China and the United States, the world's two largest economies, could be entering a risky new chapter in their trade dispute. But Wall Street recovered most of those losses in an afternoon rally predicated on the prospect that the Federal Reserve may slow down on interest rate increases next year.
At one point in the day, the S&P 500 was down as much as 2.9 percent, mirroring steep declines in Asia and Europe. A recovery late in the trading day, however, left the index down only about 0.2 percent at the closing bell.
The dueling messages continued on Friday morning in Asia, where markets were mixed and futures that predict Wall Street's opening showed a modest drop.
The worldwide drop was set off by news that the chief financial officer of the Chinese telecom giant Huawei, Meng Wanzhou, had been arrested in Canada at the request of the United States. Her detention on Saturday, the same day President Trump and President Xi Jinping of China agreed to a trade truce, could further complicate efforts to resolve a dispute that has weighed on financial markets in recent weeks.
In recent days, skepticism had already grown about prospects for that 90-day truce, as Trump administration aides played down the chances of striking a broad deal and Mr. Trump threatened further tariffs on imports from China, even calling himself a "Tariff Man" in messages on Twitter.
But the arrest of Ms. Meng, the daughter of Huawei's founder, threatened to open a riskier new chapter in a fight that investors increasingly see as a threat to financial markets and the economy.
"This is going to continue to be a headwind at a time when people are worried about global growth," said Dan Clifton, a head of policy research with the analysis firm Strategas.
For most of the year, the United States -- less reliant on trade than most wealthy nations -- had been a global standout, thanks in part to a burst of fiscal stimulus from the Trump tax cuts, while the trade war caused trouble in the rest of the world's financial markets.
In China, where the economy is growing at its slowest pace in almost a decade, stocks have slumped more than 20 percent. Export-based economies that are closely tied to China -- like Japan and Germany -- have started to struggle too. Growth in emerging markets, which often supply the commodities that have fueled the Chinese boom in recent decades, has also been hurt.
But in recent weeks, worry about the trade war has begun to take hold in the United States as well. Since its peak in late September, the S&P 500 has declined by 8 percent, as investors grew concerned about the outlook for corporate profits, the potential costs of the trade spat and rising interest rates, which are traditionally viewed as a negative for stocks.
The outlook for interest rates shifted suddenly on Thursday, when The Wall Street Journal published an article saying Federal Reserve officials were considering emphasizing a "wait-and-see" approach to future rate increases at the central bank's meeting later this month. Although this message was in line with previous Fed comments, the stock market began to recover soon after the article was published.
The rally did little for investors in energy shares. The sector has been hard hit by a slump in crude oil prices in recent weeks and was the worst-performing part of the S&P 500 on Thursday.
Prices for benchmark American crude oil fell more than 2 percent on Thursday, as OPEC ended its meeting on Thursday without reaching a deal to reduce oil output, even as Saudi Arabia pressed for production cuts. Exxon Mobil and Chevron both dropped more than 1 percent.
Elsewhere, yields on government bonds dropped sharply early in the day as investors flocked to the safety of Treasury debt. But the declines in yields moderated late in the day, in tandem with the shift in stock trading.
Bond yields, which move in the opposite direction of prices, tend to drop as investors downgrade expectations for growth and inflation.
Those lower yields can crimp the profitability of banks, which charge interest rates that are based on government bond yields. The threat of such pressures has hammered American financial stocks in recent days. The S&P 500 financial sector index was the second-worst-performing part of the market on Thursday, dropping 1.4 percent.
And while few expect a hasty end to the economic expansion in the United States, the recent swings in stocks suggest investors are increasingly worrying about any threats that could worsen growth forecasts.
"There's a bit of a growth slowdown in place," said Kate Moore, chief equity strategist for BlackRock. "This is a very different environment from where we were this time last year."

As the Global Economy Cools, Millions Are Still Short of a Full Recovery

Full text: LONDON -- Only a few months ago, the world's fortunes appeared increasingly robust. For the first time since the wealth-destroying agony of the global financial crisis, every major economy was growing in unison.
So much for all that.
The global economy is now palpably weakening, even as most countries are still grappling with the damage from that last downturn. Many nations are mired in stagnation or sliding that way. Oil prices are falling and factory orders are diminishing, reflecting slackening demand for goods. Companies are warning of disappointing profits, sending stock markets into a frenetic bout of selling that reinforces the slowdown.
Germany and Japan have both contracted in recent months. China is slowing more than experts anticipated. Even the United States, the world's largest economy, and oft-trumpeted standout performer, is expected to decelerate next year as the stimulative effects of President Trump's $1.5 trillion tax cut wear off, leaving huge public debts.
The reasons for this turn run from rising interest rates delivered by the Federal Reserve and other central banks to the unfolding trade war unleashed by the Trump administration. The likelihood that Britain's torturous exit from the European Union will damage trade across the English Channel has discouraged investment.
None of this amounts to a screaming emergency, or even a pronounced drop in commercial activity. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a think tank run by the world's most advanced nations, recently concluded that the global economy would expand by 3.5 percent next year, down from 3.7 percent this year.
Yet in declaring that "the global expansion has peaked," the brains at the O.E.C.D. effectively concluded that the current situation is as good as it gets before the next pause or downturn. If this is indeed the high-water mark of global prosperity, that is likely to come as a shock to the tens of millions of people who have yet to recover from the devastation of the Great Recession.
Though the slowdown appears mild, it also holds the potential to intensify the widespread sense of grievance roiling many societies, contributing to the embrace of populists with autocratic impulses. In an age of lamentation over economic injustice, and with political movements on the march decrying immigrants as threats, weaker growth is likely to spur more conflict. Slower growth is not going to make anyone feel more secure about the prospect of robots replacing human hands, or jobs shifting to lower-wage lands.
"It's just going to exacerbate the tensions that have led to the socioeconomic and political problems we have seen in the United States and parts of Europe," said Thomas A. Bernes, an economist at the Center for International Governance Innovation, a Canadian research institution. "Inequality is going to become even more pronounced."
In Greece, Spain and Italy, the youth unemployment rate is stuck above 30 percent. In Britain, the typical worker has not seen a pay raise in more than a decade, after accounting for inflation. South Africa's economy is smaller today than it was in 2010, and now the country is ensnared in recession.
In the United States, the unemployment rate has plunged to 3.7 percent, its lowest level since 1969. Yet so many people have given up looking for work that less than two-thirds of the working age population was employed as of October, according to the Labor Department. That was a lower share than before the 2008 financial crisis.
"We see a lost generation," said Swati Dhingra, an economist at the London School of Economics. "There was already wage stagnation and productivity stagnation. The trade war has exacerbated all of that."
The biggest risk to global growth appears to be that the trade war is, at least in part, working as designed.
Although the United States and China agreed on Saturday to further trade talks, Mr. Trump has excoriated China as a mortal threat to American livelihoods, accusing Beijing of subsidizing exports and stealing intellectual property. He has affixed tariffs on some $250 billion in Chinese exports in an effort to pressure Beijing to change its ways.
This has produced little change in China's economic practices. It has actually increased the American trade deficit with China, contrary to Mr. Trump's stated aim.
But it has thrown sand in the gears of China's industrial juggernaut. As of September, China's rail freight usage, bank lending and electrical consumption had increased about 9 percent compared with the previous year, down from a pace of more than 11 percent in January.
China's growth was already slowing as its leaders seek to transition from an economy powered by prodigious exports, in enterprises that have spewed pollution, toward a cleaner future propelled by domestic consumption. But the American tariffs have prompted multinational companies to shift orders from Chinese factories to plants in other lands, from Vietnam to Mexico. Uncertainty over the future has postponed some business.
"There's now potential for bad news on the trade front to trigger shifts in equity markets and a pullback on investment," said Steven J. Davis, an international business expert at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.
Given that China is the world's second largest economy, the consequences of its slowing ripple out widely, helping explain a pronounced drop in factory orders in Germany. American farmers have suffered lost sales as China has responded to tariffs by slapping duties on imports from the United States, not least on soybeans. Stock markets and oil prices have plunged in part on fears that China will buy fewer goods.
Much of the dip in American share prices reflects the increasingly embattled state of major technology companies like Facebook, which has drawn public ire for failing to prevent its platform from serving as a primary conduit for hate speech and misinformation. But technology shares have also plunged because many companies, Apple among them, now depend on China for enormous volumes of sales -- sales now at risk in the face of the trade war.
A glance at Mr. Trump's Twitter feed reveals that share prices are one of the data points he cares about deeply. As the markets recoil, the Trump administration has flashed signals that it may be prepared to entertain a cease-fire with China to limit economic damage.
But the conflict goes far beyond trade, with hawks inside the Trump administration seeking to inflict harm on China to impede its continued ascent as a global superpower. If that is the mission, Mr. Trump may be willing to absorb economic costs as the price of containment.
That take appears consistent with Mr. Trump's growing fixation on the Federal Reserve, which the president just branded "a much bigger problem than China," in an interview with The Washington Post.
In lifting interest rates, the American central bank has been acting under the accepted wisdom that too much easy money sloshing around for too long tends to produce trouble, from higher prices to financial mischief. Yet the effect of raising rates is to limit American economic growth, hence Mr. Trump's unhappiness.
The Fed's action has also visited distress on emerging markets. Higher American interest rates have prompted investors to abandon developing economies in favor of safer, more-rewarding opportunities in the United States. The changing of the tide has contributed to crises in Turkey and Argentina, while denting the value of currencies and slowing growth prospects from India to South Africa.
The European Central Bank has also been withdrawing the cheap money it unleashed to attack the crisis, phasing out purchases of bonds. This has made credit more expensive across the continent, depriving businesses of capital needed to finance expansions. And that has muted once-hopeful talk that Europe had finally transcended the torpor of the last decade.
A populist government in Italy is engaged in a standoff with European authorities over its spending plans, which breach the union's limits on deficit spending. That has prompted investors to demand higher returns for Italian debt, further squeezing credit. Mr. Trump's tariffs on steel and aluminum also appear to be cooling growth in Europe. Ditto, Britain's exit.
Only last year, Spain had emerged from a veritable depression to become a leading example of Europe regaining vigor. But Spain is expected to expand by only 2.2 percent next year, down from nearly 2.6 percent in 2018, according to the O.E.C.D. The rest of the 19 countries that share the euro currency are expected to dip from an already weak 1.9 percent rate of expansion to 1.8 percent.
"It's a bit like watching a heavily overweight bird try to take off," said Peter Dixon, a global financial economist at Commerzbank AG in London. "It staggers to the end of the runway and starts to take off but never really soars."
The same can be said for the global economy. It is clearly far removed from the terrifying days of the financial crisis. Yet it never really got its groove back enough to generate impressive numbers of jobs, or put meaningful pay increases in the pockets of ordinary people.
And now, despite all that, leaner times are unfolding.

Full text: It's not your imagination: The cost of housing in the United States really has increased a lot in the past two decades.
A recent study by Zillow compared changes in estimated median home values over a 20-year period, based on how much space a single dollar could buy. The company used home values from its online index of single-family homes, co-ops and condos, both on the market and off.
As of July 2018, a dollar bought 1.07 square inches of living space in a typical American home -- roughly half of the 2.09 square inches it bought in 1998. (The figures are not adjusted for inflation.) And in many metropolitan markets, the change was even greater. In Philadelphia, for example, a dollar bought 1.22 square inches in 2018, less than a third of the 3.79 square inches it bought in 1998.
How have home prices changed over time in the country's 10 most populous areas? Without exception, they increased from 1998 to 2008, a trend that has mostly continued over the past decade, though at a slower pace. The sole outlier was Chicago, which has become slightly less expensive in the past 10 years.

Full text: After decades of ducking the legal requirement that it undergo a thorough financial audit, the Pentagon finally opened up its books to 1,200 outside accountants and analysts. The report was recently completed, and here's the good news: The Army Corps of Engineers (most of it, anyway) and the Military Retirement Fund passed the audit.
The bad news: The Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines and most other divisions failed, which means they were unable to show that they were properly keeping track of their finances and assets.
The Pentagon has long prided itself on being a "can do" organization, firmly committed to protecting the nation. But when it comes to husbanding the billions of taxpayer dollars that pay for the vast military establishment, defense leaders have had less exacting standards.
"We failed the audit," Deputy Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan told reporters with a curiously nonchalant air. "We never expected to pass it."
The Pentagon failed the audit largely because there are serious gaps in the financial controls that guide it, the world's largest military organization. It has $2.7 trillion in assets (weapons, bases and such) and $2.6 trillion in liabilities (mostly the costs of military personnel and retirees). Basically, the auditors couldn't account for where all the money went because of flaws in information technology systems.
That laxity -- and the prospect of tax dollars flowing to boondoggles -- would be concerning at any time. But it is especially worrisome when the federal budget deficit has skyrocketed to $779 billion -- and the military is insisting it needs more money.
In a way, Mr. Shanahan's attitude is understandable. The Pentagon is an enormous bureaucracy -- three million people, 15,700 aircraft, 280 ships, 585,000 facilities at 4,700 sites worldwide, an annual budget of $700 plus billion -- and some experts say that expecting a clean bill of health on the first audit was never realistic.
Yet the Pentagon had nearly three decades to prepare for this accounting Judgment Day. While federal agencies were mandated by Congress in 1990 to begin performing annual financial audits, the Pentagon resisted for so long that it became the last one to comply with the law. Private companies, accountable to shareholders, couldn't get away with that.
But audits are hard work; most defense officials aren't business experts; and to some, bookkeeping and other management operations just aren't a priority in wartime, which since Sept. 11, 2001, has been a permanent state.
Most important, the Pentagon is skilled at bucking Congress, which is what it did all those years. This, even though the Government Accountability Office, a government watchdog, put the Defense Department on its list of agencies vulnerable to fraud, waste and abuse in 2015.
The Pentagon was granted a virtual blank check to fight terrorism, and it still gets most of what it wants. It accounts for more than half of the federal discretionary spending, with a budget greater than the military spending of the next seven countries combined, including China and Russia.
So what did the audit -- which cost some $413 million and covered every military asset, from buildings, fences, storage tanks, planes, computers, spare parts, invoices, purchase orders and contracts -- find?
There are major flaws in how the Pentagon handles its information technology. The flaws include failing to revoke the credentials of former employees and using systems that can be hacked.
Officials said the auditors accounted for all major military equipment, even discovering $53 million worth of uninstalled missile motors at Hill Air Force Base in Utah that were cataloged erroneously as "not in working condition." That's an improvement from January, when defense officials acknowledged that they had lost track of 39 Black Hawk helicopters.
But the Pentagon was found to lack the systems and controls needed to "provide assurance over the existence, completeness and the valuation of inventory and related property recorded in the financial statements." In all, the audit identified 20 "material weaknesses" that "could adversely affect DoD's financial operations."
They discovered ineffective payment systems, outdated financial management information technology systems, and an inability to substantiate that Pentagon real estate assets were properly cataloged and valued, among other complaints.
The auditors estimated that the Pentagon made "improper payments" -- which lacked sufficient or appropriate documentation or approvals -- of $957 million in 2017 and $1.2 billion in 2018. While even that larger amount is a fraction of the overall Pentagon spending, such payments grew by 25 percent over those two years, a worrying trend that needs to be reversed.
Anyone expecting the discovery of pilfered funds will be disappointed. The audit wasn't looking for fraud -- which generally refers to malicious illegal activities -- and Defense Department officials said it found none. (Different audits examine different aspects of an organization.)
Its purpose was to determine whether accounts could be reconciled, making the results less sexy, perhaps, but still important. The inability to accurately track how money is spent makes it impossible to know whether precious resources are going to the right places, undermining the Pentagon's ability to be successful in its far-flung missions around the globe.
But it would be misleading to imply that such an immense bureaucracy is not also experiencing actual fraud, abuse or waste. Cost overruns and performance issues with such major weapons as the F-35 fighter jet and missile defense systems have been well documented in the past, raising doubts about the Pentagon's ability to responsibly manage taxpayer dollars.
And the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction has spent six years documenting more than $400 million in questionable costs, unfinished projects and poorly executed programs, and pursuing 132 criminal convictions, in Afghanistan, the site of America's longest-running war.
Last month, for example, a former recruiter of language interpreters for the American military was charged in an alleged scheme to recruit unqualified interpreters to work with American combat forces in Afghanistan. And in September, the former owner of a now defunct marble mining company in Afghanistan was found guilty in federal court for his role in defrauding the Overseas Private Investment Corporation and defaulting on a $15.8 million loan.
The unfavorable audit results come at an awkward time. A recent congressionally mandated study reached the alarming conclusion that despite all the money spent on defense, the United States today is so weakened that it "might struggle to win, or perhaps lose, a war against China or Russia." The study also found that America's military superiority and technological edge over those two major adversaries has eroded.
The Pentagon, defense hawks in Congress and defense contractors relentlessly push for bigger military budgets and will continue to do so. The commission that did the study recommended future annual increases of 3 percent to 5 percent above inflation, which could give the Pentagon a budget of $972 billion per year by 2024, a cumulative increase of 44 percent over the current budget, according to Taxpayers for Common Sense. But throwing more money at the Pentagon doesn't automatically make it more effective. Nor does it translate into better national security, as America's "forever wars" in Afghanistan and elsewhere demonstrate.
The nation needs to be more honest about the choices it is making (investing trillions more dollars in the nuclear arsenal is especially foolhardy) and realize that other investments -- in diplomacy and development overseas, in job training and infrastructure projects at home -- are also crucial to national security.
Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and his leadership team deserve credit for finally opening the books for an audit, thus providing a baseline against which the management of future spending can be measured.
Before rushing to push Pentagon spending even higher, however, Congress, which has shirked its vital oversight role, would be well advised to make sure that critical reforms are undertaken by a stubbornly change-resistant bureaucracy, so Americans can be certain their tax dollars are being spent effectively.

Full text: BUENOS AIRES -- When plans were first made for Argentina to play host to the heads of state of the world's top economies at this week's Group of 20 summit meeting, the government saw the gathering as a golden opportunity to portray Argentina as a prosperous, stable nation.
But when the world leaders arrive in Buenos Aires on Friday, they will find a country reeling from a severe recession and rattled by a recent string of security incidents.
Among them are an attack on soccer players by a pack of unruly fans just last weekend, a suspected bombing plot by vegan activists and the recent arrest of a pair of brothers in Buenos Aires suspected of ties to the Lebanese militant movement Hezbollah.
Meanwhile, public worker strikes have led to the cancellation of scores of flights this week and snarled commutes in much of the country.
So as government officials set out to lock down much of the capital before the summit meeting, Patricia Bullrich, the top security official, had a blunt piece of advice to residents of the city of nearly 2.9 million: Consider hitting the road.
"Our recommendation is to use the long weekend to get out, to leave on Thursday because the city will be complicated," Ms. Bullrich said.
That advice was incongruous with the high hopes Argentina's government expressed just a year ago when it assumed the G-20 presidency.
"We inspire confidence around the world because they see we're going down the right path," President Mauricio Macri said then.
During a 12-year era of leftist rule by Presidents Néstor Kirchner and his wife, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, Argentina defaulted on its foreign debt, which drove investors away, and cultivated close ties with China and Russia as it drifted away from the United States.
Since his election in 2015, Mr. Macri, a center-right politician, has sought to restore the confidence of investors by reining in public spending. He has also realigned Argentina's foreign policy by cultivating closer ties with the Trump administration.
And he has pushed to position Argentina as a prominent actor in global debates on issues like climate change, migration and trade policy.
"We went from being a country that was on the global sidelines" to having the responsibility of planning the G-20, Mr. Macri said last year. "We have to take advantage to make sure the world sees all our potential, live and in person."
Instead, leaders from the world's largest economies will arrive to a country that is facing many difficulties, particularly with its economy, that have contributed to a plunge in Mr. Macri's approval ratings.
As the Argentine currency devalued precipitously earlier this year, Mr. Macri took the politically painful step of turning to the International Monetary Fund for a loan. Then, just months later, that loan had to be expanded.
Still, without much good news to show, Argentine officials are going to great lengths to pull out an orderly summit meeting.
The government is deploying 22,000 security forces and closing off large sections of the capital to protect the visiting heads of state and their delegations. The city of Buenos Aires declared Friday a holiday to ease traffic and encourage people to leave town.
Officials are mindful of the riots that marred the G-20 summit in Hamburg, Germany, last year. Critics of globalization of capitalism burned cars, looted businesses and clashed with the police in confrontations that left hundreds injured and led to the arrest or detention of more than 400 people.
This year's meeting comes at a period of considerable social unrest in Buenos Aires, where protests and street blockades have become a near daily occurrence. And December has historically been a month when these types of demonstrations turn violent, particularly at times of economic upheaval.
The suggestion that residents of the capital leave town during the event was met with outrage by Argentines, who have been struggling to make ends meet amid soaring inflation.
"I barely have enough money for food and she wants me to leave the city?" said Paula Valladares, 46, a caregiver to the elderly. "I need to work. If I don't work, I don't eat."
Anyone who tried to get an early start to the recommendation faced some trouble on Monday as all flights by the state-owned airline Aerolíneas Argentinas were canceled because of a workers' strike.
Early Tuesday morning, all public transport came to a halt for three hours in another strike.
Even before this weekend's attack on a bus transporting Boca Junior soccer players to a stadium -- in which several players were injured, leading to the postponement of a long-awaited match that will now take place outside the country -- the city was already on edge after bomb threats led to the evacuation of the American Embassy, the regional airport, the Senate, a bank and a hospital.
Those all proved to be false alarms.
But earlier in the month, a group of vegan anarchists were accused of leaving an explosive device in Recoleta Cemetery, the place of rest of several important figures in Argentine history, including the former first lady Eva Duarte de Perón.
One of the people implicated in the plot was injured after the device apparently detonated prematurely.
The government also blamed an anarchist group for a homemade bomb that was thrown at a judge's home.
Another unusual episode that made headlines was the arrest in mid-November of two Argentine citizens accused of having links to Hezbollah. Their family vehemently denied that the two men, ages 23 and 25, were terrorists.
The Center for Legal and Social Studies, a human rights group in Argentina, charges that the country's government has used the G-20 as an "excuse to further harden its speech against social protest and street demonstrations and exaggerate its war against terrorism."
Organizations planning the main anti-G-20 protest, taking place on Friday, say they are sure the city lockdown will affect participation. But they still expect a large turnout for a march that will end in Congress -- about three miles from where the world's most powerful leaders will be gathered.
Some in the city can't wait for the whole thing to be over and done with.
"We have such a huge country, why did they have to come here?" wondered Esteban Torres, a 31-year-old retail worker. "As if life in this city weren't difficult enough."

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve is poised to raise interest rates at its next policymaking meeting in mid-December and to continue raising rates next year, according to the minutes of the central bank's last meeting published on Thursday.
The minutes said most Fed officials were confident about the economy when they met in early November.
Some Fed officials at the meeting said they were less certain about the economic outlook and about the Fed's policy plans. But the account of the meeting provided no indication that the central bank is preparing to pause, notwithstanding the hopes of investors and frequent public attacks by President Trump.
"Almost all participants expressed the view that another increase in the target range for the federal funds rate was likely to be warranted fairly soon," barring unpleasant developments, the minutes said.
The Fed's policy arm, the Federal Open Market Committee, last raised its benchmark rate in September, to a range of 2 percent to 2.25 percent, then left the rate unchanged at the November meeting. The central bank is widely expected to increase the rate by a quarter of a percentage point in December.
The stock market surged on Wednesday after investors interpreted a speech by the Fed's chairman, Jerome H. Powell, as an indication that the central bank may leave rates closer to the current level. The minutes, however, contained no hint of any such shift in plans at the time of the meeting. Analysts said they were skeptical that the Fed meant to signal a change on Wednesday.
Paul Ashworth, chief United States economist at Capital Economics, said that the market had overreacted, and that the minutes "do not suggest that Fed officials anticipated an imminent pause in the tightening cycle." He said he expected a rate increase in December and two more during the first half of 2019.
The market's reaction on Thursday was much more subdued, with the S&P 500 index closing down 0.2 percent.
The Fed is seeking to wean markets from the expectation that it would continue to raise its benchmark rate every quarter. A rate increase in December would be the fifth straight quarterly increase.
The account emphasized that the central bank's policy "was not on a preset course," a phrase Mr. Powell also has used in recent remarks. The minutes said the Fed might remove language that predicts "further gradual increases" from its next policy statement to underscore the point that officials will make decisions based on the latest data. But the central bank also said most officials expect "further gradual increases."
Mr. Trump has loudly complained that the Fed is throttling growth by raising rates. He renewed his attacks earlier this week, insisting in a pair of interviews that the Fed's march toward higher rates posed a significant threat to the economy.
Some economists agree with Mr. Trump that the Fed should take a break from raising rates, noting that there is little sign that the economy is in danger of overheating. The Commerce Department reported on Thursday that a key measure of inflation rose by 1.78 percent over the 12 months ending in October, below the 2 percent annual pace that the central bank regards as optimal.
"The Fed's mandate is price stability, and price growth has actually slowed," Jason Furman, a Harvard economist who was chairman of President Barack Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, wrote on Twitter on Wednesday. "I don't understand why wages and prices are moving in different directions, it is very plausible that price growth will pick up again. But I don't see much cost to a pause while we figure it out."
Lawrence Summers, who served as Mr. Obama's chief economic adviser, also has urged caution. In an interview with Fox Business Network scheduled to air on Friday, Mr. Summers said he disapproved of the way Mr. Trump was expressing his concerns, but he agreed with the substance. "I do think that there are more risks of overtightening than there are of under-tightening right now," he said.
Mr. Powell has said that the central bank is moving forward with rate increases because the economy is in good health, and that the Fed is trying to strike a balance between allowing the current expansion to continue and ensuring that inflation remains under control.
The economy grew at a 3.5 percent annualized pace in the third quarter, job growth is strong and wages are rising, buttressing the intentions of Fed officials to continue raising rates.
But the minutes noted "some signs of slowing in interest-sensitive sectors" like housing and car sales and said that "conditions remain depressed" in the agricultural sector because of trade tensions.
Fed officials at the November meeting also reviewed a change in the mechanics of monetary policy that the central bank adopted after the 2008 financial crisis.
Before the crisis, the Fed raised interest rates by draining reserves from the banking system. During the crisis, the Fed purchased trillions of dollars in Treasuries and mortgage bonds, which it paid for by pumping reserves into the banking system. The Fed could have reversed the process before raising rates. Instead, it chose to raise rates in a new way, by paying banks to leave reserves untouched.
The Fed is slowly reducing its bond holdings, and officials are debating whether to slash them to a level that would allow a return to the pre-crisis system. The account of the November meeting said officials were pleased with the new system, which has increased the Fed's control over financial and economic conditions, but made no final decision.
Officials did approve a small tweak. Under the new approach, the Fed aims to keep its benchmark rate near the midpoint of a quarter-point range. Initially, the interest rate the Fed paid banks on reserves was set at the top of the range.
But earlier this year, the Fed set the interest rate on reserves 0.05 percentage point below the top of the range, to help keep the benchmark rate closer to the middle of the range. That has been insufficient, and Fed officials approved a further reduction, if necessary before the December meeting, according to the minutes.

Full text: HOUSTON -- Oil prices have plunged by about 25 percent in the last month while the cost of gasoline has tumbled to as little as $2 a gallon in several states. President Trump is pushing for even lower prices, calling it "a big Tax Cut for America and the World."
But Mr. Trump is playing a tricky game. The United States became the world's largest oil producer this year, and a collapse in prices could hurt scores of businesses and hundreds of thousands of workers in the energy and manufacturing industries. The damage would be particularly severe in states like Texas, Oklahoma and North Dakota that voted for the president.
Oil, which is trading at around $50 a barrel, is close to an economic sweet spot. Prices are not so high that they are a burdensome tax on consumers and businesses, and not so low as to bankrupt energy companies and strain the finances of major oil exporters like Saudi Arabia and Russia.
"Trump tweets as if he has a joystick and he has everything under his command like he is playing one of these video games," said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis at the Oil Price Information Service.
Mr. Trump is expected to discuss oil prices with the crown prince of Saudi Arabia at the Group of 20 summit meeting at the end of the week. That conversation will come days before the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is expected to set production targets.
If he persuades major oil-producing nations to maintain their current output, "oil prices could go down to the low 40s," Mr. Kloza said.
That kind of drop would have been an unalloyed economic boon for the United States just a dozen years ago, when domestic oil production was declining and the country was becoming increasingly dependent on unstable or unfriendly countries like Venezuela and Nigeria.
But lower prices will have a more ambiguous impact now. After the boom in drilling in shale fields, oil production in the United States has more than doubled since 2008, to upward of 11 million barrels a day now, and the country has become a major exporter. Exxon Mobil, Chevron and other oil companies have made huge investments and employ tens of thousands of workers across the country.
After prices began to slide in late 2014, more than 160,000 oil workers lost their jobs. Hundreds of smaller drillers went bankrupt, putting pressure on banks and investors. Manufacturers and other businesses that supply the energy industry also took a hit.
At the time, OPEC decided not to cut production in order to retain market share and undercut American shale producers. That decision set off a three-year slump in prices.
"Of course I'm concerned because the price of oil is dropping like crazy right now," said Darlene S. Wallace, president of Columbus Oil, a small Oklahoma producer. "I was making a profit this year for the first time in four years, and now it doesn't look like it will end up that way toward the end of the year."
But the drop in prices has clearly been a boon to people and businesses that use oil.
Americans consume roughly 400 million gallons of gasoline a day, so every time prices fall by a penny they save about $4 million. The average retail price for regular gasoline is about $2.50 a gallon, according to AAA, about the same as a year ago. But that is $1.60 a gallon less than it was a decade earlier, when the shale-oil boom was just starting.
In addition to the benefits of lower prices for consumers, Mr. Trump appears to want a well-supplied oil market so he can press countries to cut their imports from Iran without worrying about running out of fuel. Lower energy costs should also tamp down inflation, which in turn would help keep interest rates low at a time when some analysts fear an economic slowdown.
The president might have some success in getting Saudi Arabia not to cut oil production because of how he has handled the killing of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. Thankful for Mr. Trump's public support, the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, might be more willing to tolerate low oil prices than he would have been otherwise.
Russia also appears to be in no hurry to cut production, which is at the record level of roughly 11 million barrels a day. Igor Sechin, chief executive of the Russian oil company Rosneft and an influential ally of President Vladimir V. Putin, has aggressively promoted drilling at home and abroad. Mr. Putin recently said he was satisfied with the current price of oil.
Given all those political calculations, Mr. Kloza and other energy analysts say that Saudi Arabia is likely to cut production modestly, and lobby other producers to do the same. At current prices, Saudi Arabia, which is heavily dependent on petroleum exports, can pay its bills and most oil companies can make a profit. (The global price of oil is about $60 a barrel.)
"I think everybody is keen on stability," said Sadad Ibrahim Al Husseini, a former executive vice president of Saudi Aramco. He expects OPEC will cut production by at least a million barrels a day, roughly 1 percent of global supply.
The energy minister of Ecuador, Carlos Pérez, said in a recent interview that he thought prices would end up in a Goldilocks range.
"Some talk of $60 oil. Other crazy people talk of $100 oil," said Mr. Pérez, who will represent his country at the OPEC meeting next week. "But I personally think we are going to a range of between $65 and $75."
But oil prices rarely settle at such temperate levels for long.
Any OPEC cut that raises prices would encourage more drilling in the United States and other non-OPEC countries like Brazil, potentially forcing prices back down again. And if trade tensions between the United States and China depress global growth, oil prices could slide anew.
Bernard L. Weinstein, associate director of the Maguire Energy Institute at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, said it was virtually impossible to predict oil prices more than a month in advance. That is even more the case when the president is trying to jawbone energy markets and intervene in the global economy.
"We do know that after some of Trump's tweets we have seen big drops," Mr. Weinstein said. "Trump is the unpredictable factor, not just in terms of his tweets but what he is going to do in terms of his steel and aluminum tariffs, his hiking of tariffs on another $200 billion worth of Chinese goods. He is the disrupter in chief."

__________
Before stock investors decided that the Federal Reserve chairman was flagging the end of interest rate increases, the bond market was signaling the case for raising rates had weakened.
A measure of investors' expectation for inflation over the next five years has fallen in recent weeks. The difference between the yields on five-year Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS, and the corresponding Treasuries hit 1.74 percentage points Wednesday, its lowest level of the year, according to Tradeweb. That spread is effectively the market's forecast of where inflation is heading, and it's down from 2.04 points at the start of October.
Inflation is core to the Fed's mission. The central bank has a dual mandate of spurring full employment and keeping prices stable. This market's forecast for inflation is below the Fed's target for inflation of 2 percent.
Critics of measures like the one above say it's too sensitive to short-term moves in markets such as oil (and, indeed, the most recent pullback in inflation expectations has corresponded with the tumble in oil prices over the past nine weeks).
Still, the recent slide in the expectations is an indication that investors have grown more concerned about global growth and less worried that the United States' economy will overheat and cause a jump in inflation.
The Fed has pressed ahead with rate increases this year as the economy has strengthened. Already, the central bank has raised its main policy rate three times and is expected to do so again next month.
But in recent weeks, Fed officials also have appeared to soften their tone about future rate increases. On Wednesday, stocks surged after remarks by the central bank's chairman, Jerome H. Powell, were interpreted by investors to suggest the Fed could be nearing the end of its push to lift interest rates.
Mr. Powell said interest rate increases were approaching a "neutral" level at which it would no longer provide a stimulus to economic activity. The description contrasted with his statement in October, following the last change in the benchmark rate, that the rate was still "a long way" from neutral.
The personal consumption expenditures price index, the Fed's preferred measure of inflation, has ticked up this year and was at 2 percent in September.

Markets Soar on Two Words From Fed Chairman

Full text: With just two words on Wednesday, the Federal Reserve's chairman sent stocks surging by raising hopes that the central bank might be closer to ending its push to drive up interest rates.
The chairman, Jerome H. Powell, said the Fed's benchmark interest rate was "just below" the neutral level, meaning the central bank was close to the point where it would not be tapping on the brakes or pressing on the gas. Only last month, Mr. Powell had said it was "a long way" from neutral, leaving investors worried that the rate increases would crimp growth.
The small change sent stocks soaring 2.3 percent, erasing the losses from a rocky November. To investors, the new wording meant that the Fed might leave rates closer to their current level, keeping in place the steady fuel that low rates have provided to a 10-year-long bull market.
[Before stocks surged after Mr. Powell's comments, the bond market was signaling the case for raising rates had weakened.]
Analysts quickly warned that investors were overreacting. There was little evidence in the rest of Mr. Powell's speech that he intended to signal a change in plans.
But the market's euphoria underscored the chairman's struggles to strike the right pitch in an increasingly challenging economic and political environment, as President Trump attacks the Fed and the country's growth comes under pressure. The market has been jittery over concerns that further rate increases could undermine the economy at a time when the prospects for companies and consumers may be softening.
The economy has been a picture of health, expanding at a 3.5 percent annualized pace during the third quarter. The unemployment rate has fallen to 3.7 percent, its lowest level in almost half a century. Inflation has picked up this year, and Mr. Powell on Wednesday highlighted signs of increased risk-taking in some financial markets, including lending to corporations.
But Mr. Trump has relentlessly criticized the central bank, and Mr. Powell in particular, for raising interest rates, arguing that the Fed is choking growth. Emerging signs of weakness in some parts of the economy, including auto manufacturing, agriculture and housing, are also raising concerns that the best part of the long recovery might now be in the rearview mirror.
"We're in the 10th year of the expansion, and there are some soft points," said Ellen Hughes-Cromwick, a former chief economist at the Ford Motor Company and the Commerce Department who is now the associate director of the University of Michigan's Energy Institute. "The auto sales cycle has peaked, and the housing cycle also has peaked."
Ms. Hughes-Cromwick said that she did not foresee an imminent end to growth, but that higher interest rates, combined with rising inflation and faltering corporate confidence, could set the stage for a recession. If those things happen, "I don't really see how the economy can keep powering ahead," she said.
Most economic forecasters, including at various government agencies and big Wall Street banks, expect the American economy to continue growing in 2019. But there is a broad consensus that the pace will slow as the sugar high provided by the Trump administration's $1.5 trillion tax cut and spending increases begins to wear off. Some forecasters see a small, but growing, chance of a recession.
"This is a geriatric expansion," said David Kelly, chief global strategist at J. P. Morgan Asset Management.
He noted that if growth continued through next summer, this would become the longest expansion of the American economy since at least the Civil War. Economists have long argued that expansions do not die of old age. But the end of Mr. Trump's stimulus is likely to drop growth back toward a 2 percent annual rate, leaving little margin for error.
"It wouldn't take much to go wrong to put us into a recession," Mr. Kelly said.
Mr. Trump's chief economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, tried to play down such concerns on Tuesday.
"There's a certain amount of pessimism I'm reading about. Maybe it has to do with a mild stock market correction," Mr. Kudlow said, before saying such fears were misplaced. He rattled off recent economic data -- including the latest jobs report, which he described as "very spiffy" -- before concluding, "We're in very good shape."
Mr. Powell also reiterated Wednesday that the economy was doing well, that inflation was under control and that no glaring risks were on the horizon. Against that backdrop, the Fed is still expected to raise its benchmark rate in December. Mr. Powell emphasized that the Fed would make decisions about future increases by keeping a close eye on the economy.
"We know that moving too fast would risk shortening the expansion," he said Wednesday, in remarks before the Economic Club of New York. "We also know that moving too slowly -- keeping interest rates too low for too long -- could risk other distortions in the form of higher inflation or destabilizing financial imbalances."
The Fed's benchmark rate currently sits in a range of 2 percent to 2.25 percent. In September, Fed officials estimated that the neutral rate is between 2.5 percent and 3.5 percent. Most officials predicted the central bank would raise rates three times in 2019.
In the view of many analysts, Mr. Trump and Mr. Powell themselves pose the greatest threats to continued growth.
Mr. Trump's trade war with China is inflicting pain on some parts of the economy, notably in the Midwestern farm belt, where growers of soybeans and other crops have lost access to their largest export market.
The Fed's interest rate increases are also weighing on some parts of the economy, including home building. Sales of new and existing homes have fallen in recent months as interest rates on mortgage loans have risen.
The automobile industry is being battered by the tariffs and rate increases. Mr. Trump's tariffs on aluminum and steel have raised costs, while higher rates have discouraged some potential buyers. Auto sales have been in decline since 2016, and General Motors said this week that it would cut 14,000 jobs and shut down five North American factories.
Mr. Trump has insisted loudly and repeatedly that the Fed should be held responsible for any economic weakness. In an interview with The Washington Post on Tuesday, the president said the Fed was a "much bigger problem than China."
"I'm not being accommodated by the Fed," Mr. Trump told The Post. "I'm not happy with the Fed. They're making a mistake because I have a gut, and my gut tells me more sometimes than anybody else's brain can ever tell me."
In publicly berating the Fed, Mr. Trump is breaking sharply with the practice of recent administrations, which maintained a studied silence about monetary policy.
One reason is that urging the Fed to move can be counterproductive. The Fed likes to present itself as a technocratic institution that floats above the political fray. While some policymakers and economic analysts argue that the Fed should suspend rate increases, such a pause would now expose the Fed to criticism that it is acceding to Mr. Trump.
Mr. Powell has insisted that the Fed will act without regard to Mr. Trump's statements. In a recent speech, he emphasized that the central bank is overseen by Congress, not the president.
But Mr. Powell added to his own challenges in October, in an unscripted answer to a question about how high the Fed might need to raise rates.
"We may go past neutral," Mr. Powell said during an interview at the Atlantic Festival, "but we're a long way from neutral at this point, probably."
Mr. Powell's subsequent remarks on the subject strongly suggest that he would have liked to have chosen his words more carefully. Mr. Powell and other Fed officials also have emphasized that the exact level of the neutral rate is not important to the central bank's plans.
Some Fed officials, however, have said they want to pause at that point to consider whether further increases are warranted. Others have said they want to raise rates more, judging that the economy will need a little restraint.

Full text: LOS ANGELES -- Thanksgiving movie audiences stuck with the equivalent of grandma's green beans almondine -- the tried and true. A well-reviewed sequel from Walt Disney Animation, "Ralph Breaks the Internet," sold the most tickets, followed by "Creed II," the eighth film in the "Rocky" series.
But original offerings, including a newfangled "Robin Hood" and the political drama "The Front Runner," were scraped into the garbage disposal.
"Ralph Breaks the Internet," with a voice cast led by John C. Reilly and Sarah Silverman, collected an estimated $55.7 million at North American theaters over the weekend, for a total of $84.5 million since arriving on Wednesday, according to Comscore. Its series predecessor, "Wreck-It Ralph," took in $49 million over its first three days in theaters in early November 2012, or about $55 million after adjusting for inflation.
"Ralph Breaks the Internet," which cost Disney at least $300 million to make and market, collected an additional $41.5 million in a handful of foreign countries, including China.
"Creed II," which also received mostly favorable reviews, took in a strong $35.3 million between Friday and Sunday in the United States and Canada, for a total of $55.8 million since arriving on Wednesday -- 22 percent above the Thanksgiving 2015 debut of "Creed," after adjusting for inflation.
[Read our critics' reviews of "Creed II" and "Ralph Breaks the Internet"]
Michael B. Jordan and Sylvester Stallone reprise their roles in "Creed II," which cost roughly $100 million to make and market and involved multiple studios, including Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Annapurna and Warner Bros. "Creed II" will start to arrive in wide overseas release this week.
It was not a happy holiday for Lionsgate, which released "Robin Hood" on 2,827 screens in North America. Audiences seemed to agree with critics, who largely reviled this updated version of the classic story: Ticket sales added up to about $9.1 million between Friday and Sunday, for a total of $14.2 million since arriving on Wednesday. Lionsgate spent about $100 million (not including marketing costs) to make "Robin Hood," which was produced by Leonardo DiCaprio and a partner, Jennifer Davisson. Lionsgate recouped some of its investment by selling overseas distribution rights.
While still playing in relatively limited release -- 807 locations -- ahead of a planned wider rollout next weekend, "The Front Runner" (Sony) can be declared a major box-office misfire. The film, which received mixed reviews and stars Hugh Jackman as the 1988 presidential contender Gary Hart, took in about $885,000 over the five-day Thanksgiving period. "The Front Runner" was independently financed by Bron Studios of Canada and Creative Wealth Media.
Also of note: Alfonso Cuarón's critically acclaimed "Roma" played in a handful of theaters in New York and Los Angeles, part of an olive branch by its distributor, Netflix, to awards voters. Netflix declined to report ticket sales, however.
In spot checks over the weekend, it appeared that "Roma" played to sold-out or nearly sold-out screenings. Netflix will push "Roma" into a more theaters next weekend, ahead of its worldwide streaming release on Dec. 14.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text: Milton Friedman had a message for China: To get rich, it must be free.
It was 1988. The Soviet Union was tottering. Across Eastern Europe, the communist order was on the verge of collapsing. Trying to avoid its own demise, the Chinese Communist Party had taken small steps toward unshackling its economy from the state. But prices for food and other necessities were surging as a result, and the party's reformers wanted advice.
They invited Mr. Friedman -- the Nobel laureate and champion of economic freedom -- to Zhongnanhai, the walled compound in Beijing where the country's most senior leaders live and work. Sitting down with Zhao Ziyang, the Communist Party's top leader, Mr. Friedman was tactful but insistent. If Beijing wants to help its people thrive, he said, the state must let go faster.
"I hope the Chinese people can become strong and prosperous," he told Mr. Zhao. "I wish to see China's reform succeed so that she can contribute more to the progress of mankind."
China made a different choice. Mr. Zhao and other reformists were ousted a year later. Tanks were sent to Tiananmen Square to teach the people a bloody lesson about challenging the party's power.
China would instead reform on its terms. It would free entrepreneurs to seek their fortunes, while still keeping a tight grip on essential economic levers. It would set national goals, then persuade or force people and companies to meet them. It would open up to the world at its own pace -- and the Communist Party would run the show.
To Mr. Friedman and other top economists, the strategy should have failed. Centrally planned economies breed waste and corruption. Big government ambitions cripple future generations with debt. Price controls lead to hunger and want. Official prognosticators invariably blow it. The Soviet Union proved that.
Those experts were wrong. China prospered.
Today it is the world's second-largest economy. Hundreds of millions of its people have been lifted out of poverty. It is home to the world's biggest auto industry, the second-most billionaires and the largest single group of internet users. It has some of the richest and most powerful technology companies on the planet.
China succeeded by creating its own model. It borrowed some Western ideas while rejecting others. It opened itself to the world when necessary, and put on the brakes when it chose to. It set goals and backed them with government money. It freed its people to make and spend money, but it forbade them to ask for a better deal. Entrepreneurs built modern China, and the Communist Party kept them in line.
Other potential success stories in Asia and Latin America stuck to the economic script and stumbled. They slashed budgets when international experts told them to, hurting growth. They opened up to the world before they were fully ready to compete -- and were tripped up by global turbulence. China's government, by contrast, reformed slowly and sometimes reluctantly, stepping in when external or internal forces threatened its rule. During financial crises that struck Asia in 1997 and then the world in 2008, China gained strength as other nations faltered.
China's economy now stands as an alternate narrative to Western ideals. And yet the decisions the Communist Party made to secure its economic future have led Beijing to its biggest test since Tiananmen Square.
Its goals -- a complicated mix of juicing the economy, cleaning up the country's air and water and meeting its people's rising expectations -- have become harder to reach. Its efforts to spur growth have left the country staggering under trillions of dollars in debt, while the world is taking aim at China's industrial ambitions.
And after three decades of balancing freedom and authoritarianism, China may be leaning too far toward state control under Xi Jinping, the country's top leader. The Communist Party may be putting too much stock in its own abilities at the expense of the entrepreneurs who drove China's success.
Milton Friedman might have been right after all.
Or China may still find its way.
Over and over, China has been underestimated by legions of leaders and economists who thought they knew better. "It's not only the West," said Justin Lin Yifu, a former chief economist at the World Bank, who was born in Taiwan but defected to China. "It's almost every country in the world. It's the multilateral institutions and the academics and intellectuals."
A Booming Bird Cage
Deng Xiaoping, the paramount leader of China, was worried. After the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown, his great Chinese experiment faced collapse.
He had led the country out of the chaos of the Cultural Revolution under the idea that its people should make more money. Farmers were given greater choice to plant what they liked and sell it for a profit. Entrepreneurs flocked to special economic zones, essentially capitalist petri dishes where they paid lower taxes and made their own business decisions. The economy surged, millions of people were lifted out of poverty, and China's growth become the envy of the world.
The boom, though, fostered inflation and corruption. When the tanks rolled through Tiananmen Square, they killed not just pro-democracy activists but also common people angry at surging prices for rice, vegetables and vinegar. The reformers were ousted, and the conservatives who took their place reasserted state control.
By 1990, foreign investors were fleeing and some Communist Party cadres were again suppressing entrepreneurs. Growth had fallen to one-third that of the boom years. Deng feared that, without a spark, the Communist Party would lose its control over China. Reform, he decided, had to be on the agenda again.
Finding the right balance would prove the economic foundation of modern China. Loosen the grip too much, and the Communist Party begins to face a real threat to its hold on power. Tighten too much, and it threatens to squelch the country's growth.
Reform has swung in one direction or the other, but it has long fit into the model of what one of the architects of modern China, Chen Yun, called a "bird cage economy." Entrepreneurs were free to spread their wings, as long as they stayed within the cage of government control.
In 1992, Deng embarked on his "southern tour" -- a visit to Shenzhen and other emerging capitals of Chinese commerce. He laid out the case for a "socialist market economy" that would twin an embrace of markets with respect for the Communist Party.
"If China does not practice socialism, does not carry on with 'reform and opening' and economic development, does not improve the people's standard of living, then no matter what direction we go," he said, "it will be a dead end."
He championed the lessons of people in Shenzhen like Shao Chunyou. Mr. Shao, now a successful entrepreneur who owns an electronics manufacturing company, was one of the hundreds of millions of Chinese who struck a silent pact with his country to pursue riches while staying out of the state's business.
The crackdown in Tiananmen Square was far from Mr. Shao's mind when he arrived that summer in Shenzhen. A penniless carpenter from a city in China's interior, he struggled to find work among the electronics factories and garment mills. He wasn't allowed to live in Shenzhen without a government permit, so when the police came looking for illegal workers he would hide in a cemetery. Once, he lived off discounted mooncakes after China's Mid-Autumn festival holiday.
"I still can't bear looking at mooncakes," he said.
Three years later, in 1992, Mr. Shao was earning more money at a factory making hardware parts for electronics than he had ever made before. Such successes would cement the country's path.
Conservative leaders were sidelined for reformers. Local officials loosened up, and banks started lending. China abolished ration coupons for food and drastically reduced the government's role in setting prices for grain, oil and coal. China's entrepreneurs responded. Growth surged into double digits.
Two years later, the International Monetary Fund and other leading economic institutions publicly worried that China's growth was too fast and threatened to spiral out of control. But the lessons from past failures taught China's leaders to complement their reform efforts with aggressive government action at certain moments.
The leadership forced down prices of essentials like grain, eggs, vegetables and real estate. Even as it pressured bloated state-owned companies to streamline, it often gave them breathing room. Then, when prices fell, China gave a variety of industries -- everything from tractor and electronics factories to ostrich breeders -- the power to form cartels to stay in business.
The approach worried free-market economists. While they widely acknowledged that China couldn't change overnight, they argued that state control hobbled the economy by pouring money into wasteful targets.
Mr. Friedman, the Nobel laureate, gave voice to those concerns when he returned to China in 1993. China's entrepreneurs, he noted approvingly, were thriving. But everywhere, he saw the domineering presence of the Chinese government. "Not surprisingly," he wrote later, "the managers of state-owned enterprises are not at all willing to give up their powers."
Mr. Friedman was shocked at the scale of a government-led project to build what was in effect a new city, Pudong, across the Huangpu River from Shanghai. "A Potemkin village built for a reigning emperor," Mr. Friedman wrote, predicting disaster.
A decade later, Pudong was one of Asia's hottest real estate markets.
Opening and Dragging
While China was getting richer, it wasn't enough by the end of the 1990s. It was still home to about one in five of the world's poorest people. Inflation ping-ponged, demanding constant government attention. Beijing pushed state-owned companies to get leaner and work smarter, leading to the layoffs of millions of workers.
China needed growth. To get there, the leadership reasoned, it had to join the World Trade Organization, the premier global commerce club. Membership would mean lower tariffs for China's manufacturers and give foreign companies the confidence to invest more in the country. Membership would also free China from the annual scrutiny that American lawmakers gave its human rights record before extending favorable trading terms.
The rest of the world expected that China would be forced to adopt greater political and economic freedoms to compete. "The more China liberalizes its economy, the more fully it will liberate the potential of its people -- their initiative, their imagination, their remarkable spirit of enterprise," President Bill Clinton said in 2000.
Casting aside wasted years of halfhearted negotiations, China launched an all-out effort to get in. It yielded on a number of demands made by the United States and others. It agreed to slash tariffs and lower trade barriers to telecommunications, the financial sector and a host of other industries. It agreed to curb subsidies.
In the bargain, China got what it wanted, paving the way for a global trading colossus.
After China's entry in the W.T.O. in 2001, its exports doubled in three years and nearly tripled in four. Investment poured into the country. Global manufacturers moved entire operations to China, while consumers around the world got cheaper tools, toys and phones.
"When China joined the W.T.O., I was so excited that I cried," said Zhu Dingding, the general manager of Hangzhou Jinyuan, which makes baby shoes and other crafts.
By 2011, orders were 10 times what they had been in 2001. He made enough money to buy a car, a Volkswagen. Three apartments followed, all purchased without mortgages.
"The W.T.O. pushed my business to develop rapidly," Mr. Zhu said. "Without the W.T.O., it would be impossible."
But China didn't change that much.
Beijing has kept its iron grip on critical levers of the economy. It has been slow to meet commitments to open up key parts of its financial system, while other essential areas like telecommunications remain cut off. It has continued to nurture businesses aimed at meeting its technological and political goals, like high-speed rail and solar panels. It hasn't fully relaxed its grip on the value of the country's currency.
China's entry into the W.T.O. caused a systemic shock, one underestimated particularly by the United States. Cheap Chinese goods ushered in a new era of low prices, upending industries from textile mills in South Carolina to circuit board manufacturers in Japan and fashion designers in Italy. One study suggested that, between 1999 and 2011, Chinese imports eliminated one million American manufacturing jobs, plus more in other industries.
"China's entrance into the World Trade Organization has enabled the greatest jobs theft in the history of our country," Donald J. Trump said at a campaign appearance in 2016, four months before he was elected president.
'Can China Save the World?'
As the global financial system tottered in 2008, an influential Chinese leader chastised Henry M. Paulson, then the United States Treasury secretary and a former Goldman Sachs executive.
The leader, Wang Qishan, was among the first Chinese officials to soak in the lessons of the free market evangelists. But he told Mr. Paulson that China had perhaps listened to the West long enough.
"You were my teacher, but now here I am in my teacher's domain, and look at your system, Hank," Mr. Wang said, according to Mr. Paulson. "We aren't sure we should be learning from you anymore."
Nobody was unscathed by the global financial crisis. Washington bailed out Wall Street and Detroit, then its efforts slowed to a crawl as a new president, Barack Obama, clashed with Congress over the size of a stimulus package. Europe also fell into squabbling as individual countries fell into crisis, creating cracks in the union.
While China withstood the initial shock, the ripples threatened to become devastating. Exports plunged and economic growth slowed as foreign markets dried up. Factories began to lay off workers. Later, economists at the World Bank would estimate that as many as 36 million Chinese workers had lost their jobs.
What followed was perhaps the greatest show of financial firepower the world has ever seen -- and it wouldn't have been possible without government controls that would have made Milton Friedman blanch.
Beijing unleashed a nearly $ 600 billion spending package in an effort to rev up its economy. It called for building rail lines, highways, power lines and other big infrastructure projects across the country.
Then it began to lend. The central bank flooded the country with money, and China's economic leaders told its government-backed banks to start giving out loans. State-run companies were told to build and invest, and local government officials were told to help them. By one estimate, the financial stimulus totaled, over three years, nearly $ 1.4 trillion.
Asked one headline, "Can China Save the World?"
In some ways, China was well positioned for this moment. Early in its embrace of capitalism, it recognized the treasure it had in the savings of its people. Currently, their savings rate is nearly three times that of the United States -- driven in part by worries that an underdeveloped social safety net won't help them when they retire or get sick.
Because the government controlled the banking system, it could force banks to extend mercy to troubled borrowers or simply roll over their loans at more agreeable terms. It could ignore the advice of global investors and institutions, like the International Monetary Fund, that preached open markets and austerity, sometimes to disastrous results.
China also kept money from leaving the country. It put limits on how much people could move overseas and kept a tight grip on the value of its currency, the renminbi.
The contrast between China and the rest of the world was stark. Beijing moved swiftly -- and its growth was the rare bright spot in the global economy. Washington didn't complete a $ 787 billion stimulus package until the next year, filled with political compromises. The American economy couldn't avoid recession.
Nicholas R. Lardy, a China expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, told American officials in 2009 that "China is the gold standard in terms of its response to the global economic crisis."
Testing China's Model
More than a quarter-century after Deng Xiaoping used his southern tour to get Chinese reform back on track, Xi Jinping followed on a mission of his own.
Mr. Xi's trip to Guangdong Province in the south last month deliberately echoed his predecessor's. Like Deng, he visited start-ups, inspected their work and gabbed with factory employees. He visited an appliance company and an auto parts plant, praising the role of small businesses in the Chinese economy. China, he said, hadn't wavered from its commitment to them.
"China's reform and opening up will never stop," Mr. Xi told a group at an exhibition center celebrating decades of reform. "The next 40 years of China will bring new achievements that will make the world take notice."
So far, Mr. Xi's rhetoric hasn't matched reality. While Deng dragged the Chinese economy further out of the clutches of state control, Mr. Xi has been pulling it back.
Despite calls to rein in debt, he has kept the money flowing. Despite a push to create global technology champions, he has put the country's vibrant internet industry under the increasing authority of the party and the state. Despite promising to lift entrepreneurs, he has strengthened state behemoths, which now account for growing shares of the country's profits and industrial production.
Mr. Xi has made some modest reforms. He has loosened, just a bit, Beijing's hold on the value of its currency. He moved to allow foreign banks and automakers to directly own their Chinese operations.
But the pendulum has markedly swung toward the state at a time when the cumulative weight of four decades of choices has left the Chinese economy vulnerable. Growth is slowing -- and juicing it won't be as easy.
The lending-and-spending binge that powered its economy, and arguably the world's, after the financial crisis has saddled the country with a huge debt load. While calculating what China owes is difficult since much is off the books, debt could total $ 41 trillion -- or three years' worth of the country's economic output. That's roughly equal to developed countries like the United States, Britain and Japan. But whereas their debt built up over decades, China's accumulated in nine years.
Moving the needle has become harder. China's economy is roughly three times the size it was in 2008. Those airport and highway projects it still uses to spur growth are expensive and deliver less economic bang.
The world has also begun to take aim at China's pace of opening up and its global ambitions. President Trump has started a trade war over China's economic barriers and its state-sponsored plans to build world-beating competitors in industries like semiconductors, robotics and electric cars.
The tariffs and tensions threaten a key cog in China's trade machine: exports of goods and services, which total about one-fifth of the country's output. The United States has also taken more forceful action against Chinese companies that it believes break the global rules of trade, in some cases depriving them of buying or investing in the American-made technology they need to survive or innovate.
And in a fundamental change, China's leaders appear to be losing their willingness to experiment. Amid fear over slowing economic growth and difficult social problems, the party's talk has turned to more control. Some increasingly strident voices within the Communist Party are tapping pre-reform language to lash out against Western ideas. Even private business ownership -- a bedrock of Deng's reform and opening up -- has been criticized in some quarters.
China may also have become complacent. Its four decades of success under the China model may have persuaded the country's leaders that the Communist Party, rather than the country's entrepreneurs, drove its success, and it has little reason to let go.
"The China model concept misleads China," said Zhang Weiying, a prominent pro-market economist, "so we're going backward."
China, of course, has changed course in the past. Pragmatism has often won out.
China's leaders received a subtle reminder of that in September -- from a son of Deng, the architect of reform. In a speech to top leaders, Deng Pufang praised their work but cautioned that once China's opening had begun, it could never go back.
"Reform and opening up is the liberation of people," he said. "It encourages the recognition of people's desire and pursuit of a happy life, it stimulates the wisdom and strength of the masses, and it provides opportunities and platforms for every ordinary person to improve their lives and change their destiny."

Venezuelan immigrants, the family lived in a mansion in Florida surrounded by show horses, as neighbors peeked over the property line in awe. The family patriarch, Alejandro Andrade, had been a bodyguard of President Hugo Chávez before rising to powerful positions in his government.
This month, Mr. Andrade will be known for something else: On Nov. 27, he is expected to be sentenced for taking bribes as Venezuela's treasurer, in a money-laundering scheme that made him a billionaire.
Venezuela is facing its worst economic crisis in modern history. Inflation and devastating shortages of food and medicine have forced more than three million people to flee the country, according to the United Nations.
But among those who have left Venezuela is a small clique that made untold fortunes, including government officials, well-connected businessmen and military leaders who siphoned off billions of dollars. Many argue that this deep-rooted corruption laid the groundwork for the collapse of Venezuela today.
The beneficiaries even have a name: The "boligarchs," a term often used for the new oligarchy that emerged under Mr. Chávez's Socialist-inspired "Bolivarian Revolution."
"How could it be that a government employee had 60 horses?" said Franklin Hoet-Linares, a Venezuelan lawyer who lives a short distance from Mr. Andrade's house in Wellington, Fla., near West Palm Beach.
Mr. Andrade's plea agreement, and an indictment outlining the bribes he received, were unsealed this week in Federal District Court in Florida. They offer a window into how fortunes were amassed by Venezuela's elite before they decamped to South Florida.
With his powerful position in Venezuela, Mr. Andrade collected a stunning array of bribes, the documents assert, including three private jets, a yacht, horses and "numerous high-end watches." In his guilty plea, Mr. Andrade admitted to receiving more than $1 billion in bribes.
He is one of many Venezuelan officials accused of enriching themselves from state coffers or illegal activities.
American officials imposed sanctions this year on Diosdado Cabello, one of Venezuela's most powerful politicians, accusing him of drug trafficking, extortion and embezzling government money. Venezuela's interior and justice minister, Nestor Reverol, is under indictment in the United States for receiving payments to help traffickers transport cocaine.
And President Nicolás Maduro's inner circle -- including his wife, his defense minister and others -- "systematically plunders what remains of Venezuela's wealth," American officials contend. Several of them are also under sanctions.
The American government's case against Mr. Andrade is, in fact, built around another Venezuelan billionaire, Raúl Gorrín, who owns the news network Globovisión and has been living in Miami.
Mr. Gorrín asked Mr. Andrade -- identified as "Foreign Official 1" -- to help him secure the lucrative rights to conduct foreign currency exchanges for the Venezuelan government, according to the federal documents.
When Mr. Andrade received a bill for $174,800 to transport his horses, he simply sent it to Mr. Gorrín, who paid the invoice from his personal bank account in Switzerland. In 2012, Mr. Gorrín sent a $20 million wire transfer from a Swiss bank to purchase an aircraft for Mr. Andrade, according to Mr. Andrade's plea deal.
Separate charges against Mr. Gorrín, including nine counts of money laundering, were unsealed this week. Mr. Andrade and other Venezuelans fell under the jurisdiction of American prosecutors who say their money laundering transactions passed through the United States financial system.
Mr. Andrade has forfeited his assets -- including real estate, aircraft, horses and bank accounts -- and faces a maximum prison sentence of 10 years. Gabriel Jiménez, a Venezuelan in Chicago who owned a bank used to pay the bribes, also pleaded guilty, American officials said.
In Venezuela, Mr. Andrade was known by the nickname "the One-Eye," after a common story, that Mr. Chávez hit him in the eye by mistake during a baseball game. The two originally became close when Mr. Andrade participated in Mr. Chávez's failed attempt to take power in a 1992 coup.
In 1998, when Mr. Chávez ran for president and won, Mr. Andrade served as his bodyguard. A decade later, he had risen up the ranks to a much more prominent role, as the head of the treasury.
Then in 2012, not long before Mr. Chávez died of cancer, Mr. Andrade moved to Florida.
The Andrades were perhaps best known in the United States for their horses, with a lavish collection of steeds and their colorful names, like Bon Jovi and Hardrock Z.
"He had a lot of horses," said Elizabeth Madden, an American Olympic-medal winning equestrian. "You see that in this industry, people buying horses and stuff like that. You don't know where the money comes from."
The daily life of Mr. Andrade's son, Emanuel, a show jumping competitor, remains chronicled on Instagram, where pictures can be seen of a jet-set lifestyle with competitions in London and Madrid.
In one photo, Emanuel Andrade is riding a horse in Paris with the Eiffel Tower in the background. Another picture that circulated on Latin American news sites shows Emanuel Andrade posing next to Kendall Jenner, the American model.
The elder Mr. Andrade became known in Florida social circles, too, according to McLain Ward, an Olympic equestrian medalist who said Mr. Andrade sponsored young rider events, often ones in which his son was competing.
But beyond that, the details on the family were vague, he said.
"We knew that he was a Venezuelan living here, but about his family, not so well," said Mr. Ward, who said he sold two horses to the Andrades a couple of years ago. "We knew they were involved in the government in some way."
Mr. Hoet-Linares, the Venezuelan lawyer who lives close to the Andrade mansion, said he remains angry at the profiteering of well-connected Venezuelans while many people in the country do not have enough to eat.
Two years ago, he said, he accosted Mr. Andrade at a party about the sums he had taken and the possibility of using money to reconstruct Venezuela.
"I said, 'Look, let's find a way to help the country,"' Mr. Hoet-Linares recalled. "I think he was a little surprised. He said, 'I'm off to a trip, we can talk when I'm back."'
Mr. Hoet-Linares says he did not hear back. But while the seizure of Mr. Andrade's assets is a step in the right direction, he said, it's far from enough.
"The most perverse thing about Venezuelan corruption is that the money that they take internationally and in the U.S. does not go to the treasury of Venezuela," he said.
The equestrian community this week was also at a loss for what to make of the amount of money that the Andrades had amassed.
"If he's as strong of a rider as I think he is, he'll bounce back," Allie Rose Crowell, an equestrian competitor, wrote on Facebook about Emanuel Andrade in reaction to the news.
"But I'm not forgiving people who steal a billion dollars from one of the poorest nations on the planet, and using it for their own self interest."

Full text: Are you using the best credit card for your spending habits? Is your money stored in the best places? And are you spending all that hard-earned money wisely? A team of financial experts from Wirecutter answered New York Times reader questions about credit, debt, saving and spending.
How do I calculate how long I'll live so I can decide how much money I need for retirement?
Michael Eliastam
The Takeaway There's no way to predict exactly how long you will live. Instead, focus on the maximum you can realistically save so you won't run out of money if you live longer than expected.
First, get a realistic sense of how long you might live. There are a number of free, online calculators that can estimate your life expectancy, typically based on data from sources like the National Institutes of Health and the AARP.
The federal government offers one, but it doesn't take into account factors that may influence your life span, such as your lifestyle habits, income and where you live.
Anyway, not even the most detailed calculator can predict how long you'll end up working and living, so it's not a good idea to base your retirement plan entirely on that information.
Instead, focus on what you can do with your money now to ensure you have enough to comfortably live throughout your retirement. Here are some general rules of thumb to consider:
THE 4 PERCENT SPENDING RULE: The 4 percent rule shows that retirees who withdraw 4 percent from their portfolio each year (inflation-adjusted) could still withdraw that amount and not run out for 30 years. The bigger the initial nest egg, the more you can afford to withdraw.
Here's how it works: assuming you had $1 million in retirement savings and inflation remained steady at 3 percent each year, you could withdraw $40,000 in your first year of retirement, $41,600 in the second year, and so on. 30 years later, you hypothetically would still have money in the bank.
Note: This rule has a few flaws, including an assumption that you will earn a 5 percent return every year, that expenses will remain the same each year (in good health you may spend more on travel and entertainment, and in ailing health you may spend more on health care), inflation will be exactly 2 percent, which likely will not be the case when you retire.
THE 10X INCOME RULE: Fidelity suggests having 10 times your income saved by the time you turn 67 to generally maintain your same standard of living.
THE 25X SPENDING RULE: Since annual income isn't the best predictor of wealth (some people have high incomes yet don't save, while people with low incomes could be excellent savers), other formulas prioritize personal spending habits over income. The "25 times rule" suggests that you save 25 times the amount you anticipate withdrawing from your portfolio every year.
Can I just save $1 million
and be O.K.?
Even still, some experts worry that a seemingly big figure like $1 million is not enough. The average annual spending in 2016 for people born between 1928 and 1945 was $41,763, according to the BLS 2016 Consumer Expenditure Survey. Under the 4 percent rule, you'd need more than $1 million to support that level of spend for 30 years.
Worse, saving $1 million is unattainable for most Americans. Among those with some retirement savings, the median savings amount is $148,000 for households age 65-74, according to a 2015 study from the Government Accountability Office. And those who have saved up $1 million are likely higher income earners and therefore probably accustomed to a higher standard of living, thus they may have a hard time spending less in retirement.
Of course, there are other factors to consider when weighing how much you need to save for retirement. You'll likely collect some Social Security, and other options such as annuities could provide additional income through retirement. Sally French I'm 24, and I've managed to save about $30,000 in a personal savings account; however, I would like to invest a certain amount of those savings for a 10-year return. How much and where should I look for beginning investments? I do not have any prior investment experience.
Matthias, G.S.
The Takeaway Savings should be stocked away in the following order: emergencies first, long-term goals, including retirement, next, and then the remaining money could be placed in a low-cost index fund.
Good work on starting to save early. Now, let's make sure you have your financial priorities in order:
1 Make sure you have money socked away for emergencies
Many experts suggest having three to six months' worth of living expenses in a bank account you can easily access.
A potentially good place to store this money is a high-yield savings account, where you can currently earn around 2 percent interest on your funds. You might want more than three months' worth if you work in a high-risk industry where layoffs are common, your income isn't steady or if it's during a recession.
2 Consider investing
Your question doesn't mention why you want a 10-year return but before you start investing for that goal, it's generally a good idea to prioritize saving for longer-term investments in a tax-advantaged retirement account. The general rule of thumb is the longer term your goal, the more risky you can afford to be with your investments because you have more time to recover from market fluctuations, like a recession. And since you're so young, you have the advantage of compound interest on your side.
If your employer offers a 401(k), in most cases, it's a good idea to take advantage of it. (If you do, you'll already be ahead of a lot of your peers: A 2018 study from the National Institute on Retirement Security found that even though 66 percent of millennials work for an employer that offers a retirement plan, just over half participate.)
Your 401(k) contributions are pretax dollars, and your investments will grow tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay capital gains taxes on the money you accumulate. Taxes won't kick in until you withdraw the funds in retirement (you'll pay income taxes, but the idea is that you'll be in a lower tax bracket and pay less in taxes than you'd have to pay today).
If your employer offers some sort of 401(k) match, then the deal gets even sweeter: some employers offer to match your contributions up to a certain percent (if you have a $50,000 salary and your employer matches 3 percent of your contribution, that's $1,500 extra you receive each year).
If your employer doesn't offer a 401(k), you may want to consider investing in a traditional IRA, which allows you to deduct your contributions and not pay taxes until you take distributions, while getting the benefits of tax-deferred investment growth.
You may also want to consider a Roth IRA, which is a retirement account funded by post-tax income that you can later withdraw from tax-free. You can invest up to $5,500 per year in a Roth or traditional IRA.
3 Think about
medium-term goals
I applaud you for wanting to save for medium-term goals because at your age, there are many exciting things to save for. You have a few investment options for the remaining portion of your savings, with varying levels of risk.
Since you want access to the money in the next few years, you may want to invest more conservatively than you would for a longer-term goal, like retirement. High-yield savings accounts are a great option although the approximately 2 percent you'll earn on your money is roughly equal to inflation.
Also consider a Certificate of Deposit (CD), which is an account that requires you to hold your money there for a certain time period (this period may vary but you typically have to leave your cash untouched in a CD for at least two years to get the best rate of return.) CDs typically provide better interest rates than savings accounts but you can incur penalties for withdrawing early.
If you decide you want to dip your toe in investing, think about keeping it simple to start: Consider putting your money into an index fund, which is a low-cost way to invest in a diversified group of stocks or bonds (as opposed to investing in a single company or sector, which can be much more risky).
How to Start Investing
You can open an account through a broker such as Merrill Edge or Charles Schwab (just be aware that some brokerage accounts have minimum deposit requirements). While brokers typically charge small management fees, Fidelity recently introduced two new index mutual funds that have no fees at all.
For people who want to put in minimal effort, robo-advisers such as Betterment and Wealthfront are becoming increasingly popular as a "set it and forget it approach." Robo-advisers can create an investment portfolio for you based on a series of personal questions about your income, your risk tolerance and savings goals. After you transfer money from your bank account, the robo-adviser will manage your investments for you, typically at a lower fee than a human financial adviser. Sally French
What's the best way to start saving for a potential future child's college education before you get married or have a family?
Stuart Palley, Orange County, Calif.
The Takeaway Open a 529, name yourself the beneficiary, start saving and then make your child the beneficiary of the account when they're born. But there are risks to consider.
If you're thinking about saving for college before you have a child, or even thinking about children, you're ahead of the game. You can get a big jump on your savings goal if you open a 529 plan now, make yourself the beneficiary, start contributing around $250 a month and invest in mostly stock funds. (You'll have a good shot of meeting the savings goals we mention below if you start with $250 a month.) Once your child is born, you can make him or her the beneficiary without paying any tax on the transfer.
The onslaught of college costs and student loans may incentivize you to start saving early for your child's college education. Savingforcollege.com estimates the average total cost of attendance for a four-year college, minus any grants and scholarships, at slightly more than $115,000 in 2036 dollars. (That includes room and board, fees and books.) Mark Kantrowitz, the site's vice president of research, recommends parents save one-third of that estimate in a 529 plan, one-third will come from your income and the last third should be paid by your child, who ideally should have some skin in the game.
A 529 plan is basically a Roth IRA for college savings. You make contributions to your 529 plan after tax and then invest those contributions tax-free until your child goes to college, and then withdraw funds tax-free to pay for so-called qualified higher education expenses, including, but not limited to, tuition, room and board and books. Just more than half (56 percent) of parents today are saving for college, according to Sallie Mae and Ipsos, with 30 percent of savings in a 529 plan, 22 percent in a general savings account and 14 percent in a taxable investment account.
ONE RISK TO CONSIDER What if you don't end up having children? In this case, you could withdraw your contributions without fuss, but you'd owe a 10 percent fee and taxes on any investment gains. You could also use it on yourself for continuing education. TAYLOR TEPPER
What's the new thinking on how much of your income should go toward rent? And specifically, which kind of income (gross, net) should I be using for that calculation?
The takeaway Everyone's situation is different -- a software engineer in San Francisco may need to spend more on housing than a dentist in Des Moines, but also may not need to pay for a car. Rather than thinking about housing as a separate line item in your budget, consider how your monthly rent payment fits in with other basic necessities, as well as saving, paying off debt and luxuries.
You may have heard of the 30 percent rule, which says you should pay no more than 30 percent of your gross pay on rent (it stems from a 1969 amendment to public housing requirements called the Brooke Amendment). But it's increasingly outdated because it doesn't account for expenses that are prevalent today, such as student loans. It also doesn't account for individual situations, such as how many dependents you are (or aren't) supporting.
A way to reframe how much you can afford to spend on rent is to first look at how much you can afford to save. While it may not be realistic for everyone, the 50/30/20 rule, which was coined by Senator Elizabeth Warren in her book "All Your Worth: The Ultimate Lifetime Money Plan," suggests that you set aside 20 percent (or more) of your take-home pay toward saving or paying down debt.
From there, create a budget accounting for all of your expenses. Fifty percent of your take-home pay should be applied to necessities (housing, food, health care and clothing), and no more than 30 percent of your take-home pay should be spent on wants or luxuries.
Of course, it may not be possible to keep your rent costs low. According to the last State of the Nation's Housing report from Harvard University's Joint Center for Housing Studies, 38.1 million households in the United States spent more than 30 percent of their income on housing in 2016, which was the last time this was measured. About a quarter of those households spent over 50 percent of their income on housing.
Families who pay more than 30 percent of their income for housing are considered "cost burdened" and may have difficulty affording other necessities including food, transportation and medical care, according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The increase in cost-burdened households has been driven in part by income inequality and a lack of affordable housing.
There may be situations where you can justify paying a higher percentage of your take-home pay on rent. If you live in a pricey, bustling urban center, you might be able to save on transportation expenses or even remain carless by walking to work, entertainment and shopping centers. If your rent includes laundry, cable, utilities or luxury amenities like a gym, it may free up more room in your budget. Sally French

Full text: ISTANBUL -- President Recep Tayyip Erdogan didn't get everything he wanted.
For weeks, the leader of Turkey has been trying to undermine his regional rival, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia, with a skillful drip of intelligence leaks linking the prince to a gruesome crime: the killing of a dissident, Jamal Khashoggi.
President Trump's statement on Tuesday made clear that the United States would stick with its Saudi ally, leaving Mr. Erdogan's biggest ambition -- sidelining his rival and realigning American policy in the Middle East -- unfulfilled.
"This is not credible," Numan Kurtulmus, the deputy chairman of Mr. Erdogan's political party, told reporters on Tuesday, dismissing Mr. Trump's explanation -- that no one really knew who was responsible for ordering Mr. Khashoggi's death -- as "comic."
But that does not necessarily mean Mr. Erdogan lost the geopolitical battle over the consequences of the killing.
If anything, the Turkish president may now be in a better position than he was when Mr. Khashoggi disappeared inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul seven weeks ago.
Mr. Erdogan, who has been widely criticized for locking up more than 100,000 people since an attempted coup two years ago, has gained badly needed international stature from the case. He has successfully claimed the moral high ground vacated by the American president, and he has kept up the pressure on Saudi Arabia.
"He is standing with the overwhelming majority of people in the Arab world," said Asli Aydintasbas, a senior fellow with the European Council for Foreign Relations. "People are outraged, and they do think that Erdogan is on the right side."
"Across the Arab world, there is real appreciation for what Erdogan stands for," she added. "That's what he cares about and that's what is important to him."
Beyond that, the Khashoggi case has allowed Mr. Erdogan to soften his authoritarian image in the West and potentially build some momentum toward repairing deeply strained relations with the United States.
By steadily spooling out grisly details of the killing, Mr. Erdogan has found common cause with American lawmakers outraged by Saudi Arabia's brazen tactics. Before that, some American politicians were more focused on castigating Turkey, a fellow NATO member, for backsliding on democracy and purchasing an antimissile defense system from the Russians.
"The main benefit has been with Erdogan earning political capital in Washington, which will be useful," said Sinan Ulgen, a former diplomat for Turkey and the chairman of the Center for Economics and Foreign Policy Studies in Istanbul.
Even if he failed to cause a shift in policy within the Trump administration, Mr. Erdogan is unlikely to let the Khashoggi case go. Turkey has called for a United Nations inquiry into the killing and continues to demand answers, if only to clip the wings of the Saudi prince, whom Mr. Erdogan sees as a threat.
At the height of the affair, Turkish officials were calling on Washington to shift its alliances in the Middle East, hoping to nudge the United States away from the powerful monarchies of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, as well as from the secular military leadership of Egypt.
Turkey has squared off with Saudi Arabia on a number of fronts, including the kingdom's dispute with Qatar. Mr. Erdogan's government also opposes American sanctions on Iran, putting it directly at odds with the Saudi crown prince, often known by his initials, MBS, who described Turkey as part of a "triangle of evil."
"It was a far-fetched idea that Trump would drop MBS," said Mr. Ulgen. "There will be some disappointment in Ankara, but also realism."
In fact, Turkey expected Mr. Trump's position from the start, argued Ms. Aydintasbas.
"Erdogan is a smart politician and has been around a long time," she said. "He can see where Trump is coming from," she added. "They seem to agree to disagree."
Despite the continuing anti-American sentiment often used by the Turkish government, there are signs that both sides want to repair relations.
"You can see a desire in Ankara to normalize relations with the U.S.," Ms. Aydintasbas said. "There is also a clear desire on the side of Trump to fix relations with Turkey. Erdogan does not want to ruin that."
The release last month of an American evangelist pastor, Andrew Brunson, eased Mr. Erdogan's relations with the White House and with Congress, allowing them to move forward on other disputes that have brought relations to an all-time low over the past year.
Already, Washington has signaled it is doing more to investigate a Pennsylvania-based preacher, Fethullah Gulen, whom Turkey accuses of instigating the attempted coup in 2016.
The two nations have also begun joint patrols in Manbij, in northern Syria, where Turkey and the United States have been at loggerheads. Washington supports Kurdish forces in the region, but Turkey considers them a grave security threat.
On Tuesday, Turkey's foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, indicated some acceptance of Mr. Trump's decision to side with Saudi Arabia, without backing away from the Turkish position that whoever ordered the killing should be revealed.
Many countries did not want to fall out with Saudi Arabia over the murder, he said. "We do not want that either, yet the murder should be brought to light," he said, according to the semiofficial Anadolu news agency.
Mr. Cavusoglu was in Washington on Wednesday for scheduled meetings to address several of the outstanding disputes between the two countries. Those include an impending fine on the Turkish state bank, Halkbank, for violating American sanctions on Iran, as well as Turkey's detention of American citizens and three Turkish consular employees on charges of terrorism, which American officials call baseless.
Then, there is the important front in Syria.
Mr. Erdogan rails constantly against the United States' support for Syrian Kurdish fighters, whom he considers an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party, which Turkey, the United States and Europe have all designated a terrorist organization.
While those issues remain between the countries, Mr. Erdogan is unlikely to waste the political capital he has gained through the Khashoggi case, political observers in Turkey said.
He still can threaten to release the audio recordings of the killing, which Turkish officials have said indicate high-level Saudi involvement. But analysts say that is a "nuclear option" he is unlikely to use, since it would essentially end his leverage.
On Wednesday, in a speech at the presidential palace in Ankara, Mr. Erdogan pointedly did not mention the Khashoggi case or Mr. Trump's statement of support for the Saudi crown prince.
Instead, the Turkish president was already in full campaign mode for local elections in March, showing that national political concerns still come first as he listed his latest enemies of the state.
He slammed the European Court of Human Rights for a decision calling for the release of a Kurdish political leader, Selahattin Demirtas.
He denounced an imprisoned philanthropist, Osman Kavala, who has been swept up in his post-coup crackdown.
He thundered against wholesalers, whom he accused of raising the price of onions and potatoes.
His nationalist stance has to be seen in the light of local politics, Mr. Ulgen said.
Turkey's economic difficulties, including a drastic fall in the lira and high inflation, mean Mr. Erdogan's Justice and Development Party risks losing some important municipalities in March.
"The members of the project to make Turkey kneel down, to make our country surrender, are still in solidarity," Mr. Erdogan roared, referring to the supporters of popular protests in Gezi Park and Taksim Square in 2013.
"Those praising Gezi, weren't they the ones who destroyed all the windows, burned everything around? Didn't they burn the buses belonging to the state? Didn't they burn down the artisans' shops? Shall we tolerate them?"

Full text: Shortly after Carlos Ghosn took over in 1999 as chief operating officer of an ailing Nissan Motor, he overhauled the way the company paid senior employees.
Abandoning Japanese traditions that rewarded seniority and shunned incentive awards, Mr. Ghosn enforced a performance-based system and gave bonuses to midlevel managers.
The move rankled traditionalists but reflected Mr. Ghosn's outspoken belief in merit- and market-based recognition. "The highest achievers got the highest rewards," according to a case study of Mr. Ghosn's early years at Nissan, which is based in Yokohama.
He earned a reputation as one of his generation's most successful C.E.O.s, but now the way Mr. Ghosn managed his own rewards may prove to be his downfall.
On Monday, Mr. Ghosn was arrested in Tokyo after a company investigation alleged that he had deceived Japanese financial authorities about his pay package.
According to Tokyo prosecutors, Mr. Ghosn and Greg Kelly, a onetime Nissan human resources manager and current board member, underreported Mr. Ghosn's compensation between 2011 and 2015 by more than 5 billion yen ($44.5 million). The prosecutors say they declared pay of just under ¥5 billion ($44.3 million), which was half the nearly ¥10 billion ($88.8 million) he actually earned.
Neither man has been charged. Prosecutors have 72 hours to assess the accusations, and they can request an additional 20 days, depending on court approval, to investigate.
Nissan's board will meet Thursday to consider their removal.
For an executive long lionized in business circles and celebrated by employees, the arrest was a shocking comeuppance. Mr. Ghosn, 64, is credited with turning around two carmakers, Renault and Nissan, and engineering an alliance -- with those two companies and then Mitsubishi -- that pioneered sharing technologies and cost savings. His life has been chronicled in manga comic books in Japan. He carried the Olympic torch before the 2016 Summer Games in Brazil. At Nissan factories, autograph-seeking employees swarmed him.
He was named one of the most powerful people in business by Fortune magazine in 2003. He became a fixture on the conference circuit and a regular at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
Mr. Ghosn kept homes in Paris, Amsterdam, Beirut and Rio de Janeiro; shuttled around the globe on a corporate jet; and dined with heads of state. He collected contemporary art, invested in wineries and, in 2016, rented out Versailles to celebrate his wedding to his second wife, Carole, along with her 50th birthday. The party was inspired by Sofia Coppola's film "Marie Antoinette."
By the time prosecutors boarded his corporate jet on Monday at Haneda Airport in Tokyo to take him off for questioning, Mr. Ghosn had been embroiled in several fights over executive pay, something of a recurring subplot in his career. He has made many millions of dollars serving as chief executive and chairman of Nissan, Renault and Mitsubishi Motors. At times, his pay drew the ire of investors and politicians, including Emmanuel Macron, now the French president, when he was finance minister in 2016.
"He was always arguing about whether he was adequately compensated," said Robin Ferracone, founder of Farient Advisors, an executive compensation advisory firm. "The question was whether he should be compared to Japanese standards, or international standards or American standards."
In Japan, Mr. Ghosn's pay far outstripped those of his counterparts. As chairman of Nissan last year, he reported income of ¥735 million, more than four times the pay of Toyota's chairman.
"There was always a disconnect between Western management salaries and Japanese management salaries," said Christopher Richter, deputy head of Japan research at CLSA, an investment and brokerage group. Even though "compared to executives in other countries, some people would regard him as underpaid," Mr. Richter added, "I guess you could say there was something of a culture clash in that."
Mr. Ghosn was unrepentant about his pay and engaging when discussing his achievements. When The Financial Times this year asked him if he was paid too much, he laughed. "You won't have any C.E.O. say, 'I'm overly compensated,"' he said.
Mr. Ghosn was born in Brazil to Lebanese immigrants and moved to Beirut when he was a toddler.
He went on to study engineering at an elite university in Paris, then worked at Michelin, the tire maker, for 18 years.
He started on the factory floor, preparing rubber for the manufacturing process. Soon he was a plant manager. Before long he was deployed to his native Brazil as chief operating officer of Michelin's local subsidiary, where he expanded the business despite soaring inflation. In 1990 he was made chief executive for Michelin's troubled North American division, and he revived it.
But Michelin was a family company, and Mr. Ghosn said he knew he was unlikely to become C.E.O. When Renault, the French carmaker, recruited him in 1996, he joined as the executive vice president overseeing manufacturing, purchasing, and research and development.
At the time, Renault was reeling after a failed merger with Volvo, and Mr. Ghosn focused on improving margins by slashing costs. His aggressive approach earned him the nickname "Le Cost Killer." Mr. Ghosn didn't particularly like the moniker, but he recently acknowledged its resonance. "It's sexy," he said this year. "There's blood in it, there's meanness."
After Renault acquired a large stake in Nissan in 1999, Mr. Ghosn was sent to Japan to become chief operating officer. In a country that values hierarchy and protocol, Mr. Ghosn did away with much of the customary formality. He was seen walking the floor, shaking hands with junior staff members and bringing upper management and lower-level employees together in meetings.
Mr. Ghosn's inviting gestures went only so far. Six months into his tenure, on the eve of the Tokyo Motor Show, he presented a plan for Nissan's revival. Billed the Nissan Revival Plan, it called for the elimination of some 21,000 jobs, or 14 percent of the work force, including several top managers.
A series of manga comics, published in 2002, depicted the moment when Mr. Ghosn unveiled the restructuring plan to Nissan's executive team. The illustrations showed colleagues sweating about the news to close factories.
"Right now Nissan is just like a boat that is on fire and we need to extinguish this fire as soon as possible," the cartoon Mr. Ghosn says.
In a country where layoffs are rare, Mr. Ghosn was pilloried in the press and labeled a "gaijin," or foreigner. In a measure of his own confidence, Mr. Ghosn pledged to step down if his plan failed.
The aggressive cost-cutting worked. Within a year, Nissan's finances had stabilized. Soon after, its debt load was slashed and its profits had improved. Mr. Ghosn was named chief executive in 2001.
The next year, he took Nissan into China with a venture with Dongfeng Motor and revived sports car models like the Z and the GT-R.
But by the mid-2000s, the turnaround stalled, leading some critics to question whether Mr. Ghosn's management magic had faded. In 2006, he pursued a partnership with General Motors in the United States, but G.M. eventually ended the talks.
The recession of 2008 forced Mr. Ghosn to institute wide-ranging belt-tightening across the company, including new parts orders and factory overtime, and even the activities of the corporate-sponsored baseball team. Managers took a 5 percent pay cut.
One investment that Mr. Ghosn continued to pursue was the development of battery-powered cars. Profitability might still be elusive, but the alliance saw the models -- Renault, with its subcompact Zoe, and Nissan, with its compact Leaf -- as necessary innovations.
There was little sign that Mr. Ghosn was slowing down -- or less eager for calculated risk-taking. In 2016, he helped to orchestrate Nissan's deal for a 34 percent stake in Mitsubishi, bailing out the company after it was caught falsifying fuel economy estimates. He drew the smaller carmaker into the alliance with Renault and Nissan -- and Mr. Ghosn became chairman of Mitsubishi, earning him a third salary.
On Monday, Mitsubishi, like Nissan, said it would recommend that Mr. Ghosn be removed as chairman. In France, where Renault employs 47,000 workers, there was a more cautious response. The finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, said on Tuesday that Mr. Ghosn was "no longer in a position capable of leading Renault" because of the inquiry, but France has seen no evidence of the crimes alleged in Japan.
Mr. Ghosn had planned to spend Tuesday night far differently. According to Jun Miyaji, a manager at Kushiwaka, a restaurant serving skewered chicken, Mr. Ghosn's secretary called to cancel his 7:30 reservation for dinner.
In this small Tokyo yakitori restaurant, where photos of Mr. Ghosn are prominently displayed, Mr. Miyaji said the secretary told him "Ghosn was set up" and she added: "He will take a revenge. And he will come back to the restaurant."

Macy's Raises Forecast Before Shopping Season
Macy's raised its annual earnings forecast on Wednesday, signaling a strong holiday shopping season ahead, encouraged by good performance at its stores and its growing online business.
The department store chain, the largest in the United States, also reported much better than expected profit and sales for the third quarter, boosted by double-digit growth at its online shop.
Like many other major American retail names, Macy's has been struggling with plummeting mall traffic and a defection of customers to a new range of online and fast-fashion stores. It has closed more than 100 locations and cut thousands of jobs since 2015.
In response, the 160-year old company has invested heavily in its off-price Backstage stores, loyalty program, mobile app and website, while improving brick-and-mortar stores by equipping them with mobile checkouts and new shop layouts. REUTERS
ECONOMY
Consumer Prices Tick Higher in October
Consumer prices climbed 0.3 percent in October, with higher prices for gasoline, used autos and housing contributing to the increase.
The Labor Department said Wednesday that this measure of inflation has jumped 2.5 percent over the past 12 months. Adjusted for rising prices, average weekly wages have improved 0.9 percent this year. That is an increase of $8.52 in weekly earnings from October 2017.
The Federal Reserve targets inflation at 2 percent, just enough to encourage consumer spending and economic growth without leading to price increases that could destabilize the economy.
Fed officials are expected at an upcoming meeting in December to raise a key short-term interest rate for the fourth time this year, in hopes of keeping inflation in check and preventing economic growth from overheating in ways that could trigger a downturn.
But inflation could be tamer in future months because oil prices have been trending lower and the value of the dollar has strengthened.
Core inflation, which excludes volatile energy and food costs, rose 0.2 percent in October. This core figure, which many economists consider to be a better indicator of underlying inflation, has risen 2.1 percent from a year ago.
Gas prices increased 3 percent in October, after having dipped 0.2 percent in September. A.P.
MANUFACTURING
Volkswagen to Convert Plants for Electric Cars
Volkswagen will convert three German factories to build electric cars, as Europe's largest automaker by sales starts mass producing zero-emission vehicles in a major strategy shift following its emissions cheating scandal.
The German company said on Wednesday its plant in Emden, which currently builds the VW Passat, would build electric cars from 2022 onward, while its factory in Hannover would start making them the same year.
The Hanover plant will maintain some production of combustion-engine vehicles in addition to building battery driven cars, VW said.
"We are moving at full speed into the production of electric vehicles. Emden and Hanover are to be further model plants in Germany. Together with Zwickau, they will form the largest network for the production of electric vehicles in Europe," Gunnar Kilian, VW board member responsible for personnel, said.
VW will spend 1.2 billion euros ($1.4 billion) training workers at Zwickau, it said.
The Zwickau plant in eastern Germany will start building electric cars for three of the group's in-house brands from late 2019, VW added. REUTERS

U.S. Military Advantage Has Diminished, a Congressional Panel Finds

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Pentagon's new focus on threats from China and Russia after almost two decades of fighting terrorism "too often rests on questionable assumptions and weak analysis," an independent bipartisan commission concluded in a sharply critical report issued on Wednesday that challenges President Trump's commitment to supporting a strong military.
Over all, the panel that was appointed last year by Congress praised the general direction of the National Defense Strategy that was issued in January by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis.
But it warned that projected budget shortfalls, overtaxed military forces around the globe and other risks were imperiling the plan, just as it was taking effect.
"America's longstanding military advantages have diminished," according to the wide-ranging, 90-page report, an advance copy of which was made available to The New York Times. "The country's strategic margin for error has become distressingly small. Doubts about America's ability to deter and, if necessary, defeat opponents and honor its global commitments have proliferated."
While the defense strategy "represents a constructive first step in responding to this crisis," the report found, "it does not adequately explain how we should get there."
The National Defense Strategy represents a shift from fighting the insurgent wars of the last 17 years to large state-on-state conflicts. Mr. Trump has voiced a desire to end American involvement in the war in Afghanistan, and has chafed at keeping forces in Iraq and Syria.
Specifically, the strategy puts a higher priority on confronting China and Russia, as well as North Korea and Iran -- a complex set of new and emerging threats.
Wednesday's report said China and Russia were seeking regional hegemony and pursuing aggressive military buildups aimed at neutralizing American strengths. Additionally, it said, threats posed by Iran and North Korea have worsened in recent years as both have developed more advanced weapons.
Those rivals and others, the report found, are also increasingly engaged in what the military calls "gray-zone conflicts" -- actions short of all-out war but that include diplomatic and economic coercion, media manipulation and cyberattacks, and the use of paramilitaries and proxy forces.
The commission also cited "political dysfunction" in the United States, as well as reductions in military spending imposed by budget caps. The report said both have restrained the government from keeping pace with threats in what the panel called "a crisis of national security."
The report's sober warnings come as Mr. Trump has ordered the Pentagon to cut 5 percent from its proposed 2020 fiscal year budget -- to about $700 billion from roughly $733 billion. Representative Adam Smith, Democrat of Washington and most likely the next chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, has signaled that he favors even deeper cuts in military spending.
A Pentagon spokesman, Johnny Michael, said the department welcomed the panel's report and would carefully consider its recommendations.
"The commission's description of the complexity of the current security environment -- in which strategic competition is occurring across domains and rapid technological developments are changing the character of warfare -- is also a stark reminder of the gravity of these issues, and a call to action," Mr. Michael said in a statement.
The 12-member panel, formally known as the Commission on the National Defense Strategy for the United States, was created as part of the 2017 fiscal year defense budget to review the Pentagon's new plan even before Mr. Mattis released it. The panel is led by Eric S. Edelman, a former top Pentagon policy official in President George W. Bush's administration, and Adm. Gary Roughead, a former chief of naval operations.
Over the past two decades, while the Pentagon mainly focused on counterterrorism and counterinsurgency, the report found that foreign adversaries were studying the American military. As a result, they developed ways to counter longstanding American advantages in projecting power over distances, air and missile defense, cyberoperations and electronic warfare.
"In some cases, we are behind, or falling behind, in critical technologies," the report said. "U.S. competitors are making enormous investments in hypersonic delivery vehicles, artificial intelligence and other advanced technologies."
In the event of large-scale conflict with Russia or China, the United States may not have enough remaining forces to deter other adversaries "in one -- let alone two -- other theaters" without having to rely on nuclear weapons, the report said.
"Many of the skills necessary to plan for and conduct military operations against capable adversaries -- especially China and Russia -- have atrophied," the report said.
To counter China in the western Pacific, the commission called for investing in more long-range military transport planes as well as submarines and other undersea warfare equipment. To counter Russia, the report recommended continuing a NATO buildup on the alliance's eastern flank and the Baltics that has been underway for several years.
It also warned against large troop reductions in the Middle East, where the United States' economic and security interests "will be profound."
The report applauded the Pentagon's strategy for aggressively pursuing technological innovations and fielding those advances with forces deployed around the world.
However, it expressed concern "that America's edge is diminishing or has disappeared in many key technologies that underpin U.S. military superiority, and that current efforts to offset that decline are insufficient."
The report offered no specific suggestions about how much the military should spend to achieve these goals, other than to recommend an average budget increase of 3 percent to 5 percent above inflation.
"Available resources are clearly insufficient to fulfill the strategy's ambitious goals," it said, including assurances that the Pentagon "can defeat a major-power adversary while deterring other enemies simultaneously."
Additionally -- and notably -- commission members took the unusual step of warning that the voices of senior civilian officials in the Defense Department "have been relatively muted" on pivotal defense and national security policy.
By the end of the Obama administration, many senior Pentagon civilians were grumbling that the military's Joint Staff, reporting to Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was exercising too much influence over policy matters and subtly, though not deliberately, undermining the bedrock principle of civilian control of the armed forces.
"It is critical that D.O.D. -- and Congress -- reverse the unhealthy trend in which decision-making is drifting away from civilian leaders on issues of national importance," the report said.
In a telephone interview, Mr. Edelman, a former top aide to Vice President Dick Cheney and a former United States ambassador to Turkey, said he and Admiral Roughead had met with Mr. Mattis in May to describe their conclusions, and that the secretary found them helpful.
Mr. Mattis could use the commission's report "as a cudgel" to prod the vast and often unwieldy Pentagon bureaucracy to respond to the panel's findings, Mr. Edelman said.
Or, as the report put it, "If we do not square up to the challenge now, we will surely regret it."

Full text: WASHINGTON -- President Trump's promise to quickly pass a revamped North American Free Trade Agreement has been upended by the midterm elections, with Democrats who will soon control the House vowing to withhold their support to extract greater protections for American workers.
Administration officials remain confident they will corral the votes for the new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which Mr. Trump speedily negotiated in September to claim a big win on one of his signature issues before the November elections.
While White House officials considered pushing the revised deal through the coming lame-duck session, they did not want to risk a backlash from lawmakers in both parties.
Democrats, emboldened by their midterm win and eager to outshine Mr. Trump as defenders of the American worker, are unlikely to sign off on any deal that does not include significant changes that labor leaders and newly elected progressives are demanding. That could involve reopening negotiations with Mexico, although American and Mexican negotiators have both publicly ruled out that possibility.
"Trump made it seem like this was a done deal, but there is a long, long way to go," said Representative Bill Pascrell, a New Jersey Democrat who is likely to be named chairman of the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Trade.
The House will consider the agreement first under the Constitution's provision mandating that revenue bills originate in the lower chamber. A vote could take up to nine months or longer, according to senior administration officials.
House Democrats are particularly concerned about a provision that would require at least 30 percent of the labor used to build each car in Mexico to be completed by workers earning at least $16 an hour. That amount will rise to 40 percent by 2023 but the $16 wage is not indexed to inflation, meaning the increase will be diluted over time as prices rise.
The text of the agreement also requires Mexico to make it easier for workers to join unions.
All of these actions were intended to make it less likely that automakers and other manufacturers would shift American jobs south for cheaper labor. But Democrats and their allies in manufacturing unions -- who have remained neutral on the proposed pact -- maintain that the new requirements, while an improvement on the original Nafta, do not go far enough.
They are demanding more specifics about how the deal will be enforced, and raising questions about whether the $16-an-hour benchmark for Mexican workers -- which is about four times the typical wage for Mexican autoworkers -- is high enough to stanch the flow of American jobs to Mexico.
"Without enforcement you don't have anything. Without it, you are, shall we say, just rebranding Nafta," Representative Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, said last week, days before voters swept her party back into power.
"Right now, it is a work in progress," said Mrs. Pelosi, a former speaker who is expected to reclaim that post. "Mexico has to pass a law about labor rights in Mexico, so that has not happened yet and that is a predicate of this agreement. Most important of all are the enforcement provisions in terms of labor and the environment. Enforcement, enforcement, enforcement."
The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, and House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, have both said publicly that they will not take up the agreement this year, although several free-trade proponents in their own party, led by Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania, are urging them to reconsider.
Mr. Toomey has his own reservations about the deal -- he believes it includes too many potential restrictions on free trade -- but he warned his fellow Republicans that entering a protracted negotiation with Democrats would be a losing strategy.
"I would be shocked -- shocked -- to learn that Nancy Pelosi is going to make passing new Nafta, which would be a big win for the president, her top priority," he said.
Robert E. Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, has repeatedly assured Mr. Trump that he will be able to sell the deal to Democrats and the leaders of the United Steelworkers Union, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and the United Autoworkers Union, according to current and former White House officials.
"We are very confident that Congress will approve U.S.M.C.A.," said Jeff Emerson, a spokesman for the United States trade representative, referring to the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.

"From the beginning, Ambassador Lighthizer has worked closely with Democrats and Republicans in the House and Senate on the renegotiation of this agreement," he said, adding that the pact "is a balanced deal with strong provisions that will benefit U.S. businesses and workers and that enjoys broad support among key stakeholders."
But there are signs that Mr. Lighthizer, who has a close working relationship with many labor leaders and pro-union Democrats like Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, may have a tougher time than he anticipated.
"Words on a paper won't stop jobs from going to Mexico, unless there's real teeth behind them," Mr. Brown said.
In late October, Leo Gerard, the president of the United Steelworkers Union and chairman of the United States trade representative's labor advisory council, reviewed the preliminary text of the deal and concluded that the new agreement contained provisions that "undermine the interests of workers and consumers" while doing too little to "curtail the illegal suppression of wages in Mexico," according to a letter sent to Mr. Lighthizer.
In the letter, Mr. Gerard took issue with the administration's decision to maintain steel and aluminum tariffs against Canada and questioned the effectiveness of the agreement's proposed automotive rules of origin intended to increase the percentage of cars built by American workers.
But he saved his sharpest criticism for the Mexican wage provisions, arguing that the $16 hour average wage mandated in the deal "is arguably too low to make a significant difference" in persuading manufacturers to keep their plants in the United States. He suggested making the wage standard a minimum, rather than an average, and suggested indexing it to inflation to ensure that the wage increases aren't "meaningless."
Andrés Manuel López Obrador, a populist who was elected president of Mexico in July, supports wage increases but it is unclear if he can pass sweeping labor reforms through the country's legislature.
During a private meeting with House members of both parties last month, Mr. Lighthizer conceded that the labor provisions needed to be strengthened, but he declined to reopen talks with Mexico, according to three people who attended the meeting.
The Nafta vote will be up or down, and Congress cannot amend the text, according to the rules governing fast-track trade agreements. But negotiators from each country are free to negotiate potential changes to secure enough votes for passage in their respective chambers.
Mexican officials have said the labor standards in the deal are sufficient. Mr. Emerson said Mr. Lighthizer rejected as "false" the idea that he would consider reopening the deal. The labor standards included in the deal, he added, "are ambitious and enforceable," he said.
But Representative Sander Levin, a Michigan Democrat who attended the meeting last month, called the provision "a major flaw" and said "there will have to be some attempt to discuss this with Mexico" in order for the deal to win Democratic backing.
Mr. Lighthizer remains eager to conclude a deal as quickly as possible, people close to him said, so he can focus on China, whose trade practices he sees as a far bigger threat to American workers than Nafta, which has helped stitch together the economies of Mexico, Canada and the United States.
But there's one tactic he refuses to use to break the logjam: withdrawing from Nafta as a means of pressuring legislators to act quickly.
Mr. Trump has raised the possibility repeatedly since being elected, but has been talked out of it by Mr. Lighthizer and other advisers, most recently the National Economic Council director, Larry Kudlow, according to a senior administration official with knowledge of the situation.

Trump's Tax Cut, 10 Months Later

Full text: The $1.5 trillion tax overhaul that President Trump signed into law late last year has already given the American economy a jolt, at least temporarily. It has fattened the paychecks of most American workers, padded the profits of large corporations and sped economic growth.
Those results weren't a surprise. Economists across the ideological spectrum predicted the new law would fuel consumer spending, in classic fashion: When the government borrows money and dumps it into the economy, growth tends to accelerate. But Republicans did not sell the law as a sugar-high stimulus. They sold it as a refashioning of the incentives in the American economy -- one that would unleash more investment, better efficiency and higher wages, along with enough growth to offset any revenue lost to the government from lower tax rates.
Ten months after the law took effect, that promised "supply-side" bump is harder to find than the sugar-high stimulus. It's still early, but here's what the numbers tell us so far:
The Investment Bump
Proponents of the tax overhaul said it would supercharge the recent lackluster pace of business spending on long-term investments like buildings, factories, equipment and technology.
Such spending is crucial to keeping economic growth strong. And strong growth is central to Republican claims that the tax cuts would ultimately pay for themselves.
Capital spending did pick up steam earlier this year. For companies in the S&P 500, capital expenditures rose roughly 20 percent in the first half of 2018. Much of that was concentrated: The spending of just five companies -- Google's parent, Alphabet, and Facebook, Intel, Exxon Mobil and Goldman Sachs -- accounted for roughly a third of the entire rise. Much of that spending went toward technology, including increased investment in data centers and computing, server and networking capacity.
For the full year, Goldman Sachs analysts expect that capital expenditures for companies in the S&P 500 will be up about 14 percent, to $715 billion. Research and development spending, another component of business investment, was expected to be up 12 percent, to $340 billion.
For the economy as a whole, the surge in business investment was a bit less impressive. It's true that business spending on fixed investment -- such as machinery, buildings and equipment -- rose, jumping 11.5 percent and 8.7 percent during the first and second quarters. The first-quarter jump was the fastest for investment since 2011.
But that pace fizzled during the third quarter. Recently data showed third-quarter business investment rose at an annual pace of 0.8 percent. The last quarter of the year -- traditionally a big one for capital spending -- will fill out the picture, but that data won't be released until early 2019.
It will likely take years to get a better sense of whether the law fundamentally reshaped American corporate investment. But there's little clear evidence that it is drastically reshaping the way in which most companies invest and spend.
The results of a survey published in late October by the National Association for Business Economics showed that 81 percent of the 116 companies surveyed said they had not changed plans for investment or hiring because of the tax bill.
The Buyback Binge
Cheerleaders for the tax cut argued that the heart of the law -- cutting and restructuring taxes for corporations -- would give the economy a positive bump, giving companies incentives to invest more, hire more workers and pay higher wages.
Skeptics said that the money companies saved through tax cuts would merely increase corporate profits, rather than trickling down to workers.
JPMorgan Chase analysts estimate that in the first half of 2018, about $270 billion in corporate profits previously held overseas were repatriated to the United States and spent as a result of changes to the tax code. Some 46 percent of that, JPMorgan Chase analysts said, was spent on $124 billion in stock buybacks.
The flow of repatriated corporate cash is just one tributary in what has become a flood of payouts to shareholders, both as buybacks and dividends. Such payouts are expected to hit almost $1.3 trillion this year, up 28 percent from 2017, according to estimates from Goldman Sachs analysts.
Debts and Deficits
Supporters of the tax cuts repeatedly claimed the bill would increase economic growth enough to offset the decline in tax receipts. "I'm totally convinced this is a revenue-neutral bill," said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, when a preliminary version of the bill was approved in the Senate in December 2017.
Despite a remarkably strong economy, the fiscal health of the United States is deteriorating fast, as revenues have declined sharply. The federal budget deficit -- the gap between what the government collects in revenues and what it spends -- rose to $779 billion in the 2018 fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30. That was a 17 percent increase from the prior year.
It's highly unusual for deficits and borrowing needs to grow this much during periods of prosperity. A broad variety of analysts attribute the widening deficit to the tax cuts (along with increased military and other domestic spending ushered in through a bill Mr. Trump signed earlier this year).
Corporate tax revenues are down one-third from a year ago. Federal revenues as a whole ran $200 billion behind the Congressional Budget Office's forecast for the 2018 fiscal year -- even though economic growth was faster than the C.B.O. expected. The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget reports that nominal federal revenues are down by at least 3.6 percent since the tax cuts took effect.
The growing budget gap means the Treasury must borrow more to keep the government running. The Treasury expects to borrow a total of $1.338 trillion from global investors this calendar year. That would be 145 percent higher than the $546 billion the federal government borrowed last year. That would be the highest level of borrowing since 2010, when the American economy was struggling to recover from the great recession.
Bonus Announcements
Shortly after the tax law passed, hundreds of companies -- from large multinationals to small manufacturers -- announced that they would be using some of their windfall from the law to give one-time bonuses to employees. Others said they would raise minimum wages across the company, or expand worker benefits.
Mr. Trump and Republicans hailed those announcements as evidence that the law's benefits were flowing substantially to workers. Americans for Tax Reform compiled a list of 750 companies, and growing, that said they would pass tax savings on to workers in some form.
Data from large public companies, however, suggest that most workers received relatively small shares of their employers' corporate tax savings.
The nonprofit research group Just Capital, which is tracking 1,000 large public companies' reports of how they are spending their tax cuts, calculates that the typical worker at one of those large companies has received about $225 this year in increased salary, a one-time bonus, or both, attributable to the new law.
Workers for those companies were more likely to see their wages rise if they lived in states where the minimum wage was relatively low -- and where companies do not have to pay workers more to compensate for high housing costs. California workers at those companies saw an average benefit of about $160 each, which is less than half the average benefit for workers in Kentucky.
Many companies also said they would use tax savings to create jobs. But the Just Capital research finds that, since the tax cuts were passed, the 1,000 largest public companies have actually reduced employment, on balance. They have announced the elimination of nearly 140,000 jobs -- which is almost double the 73,000 jobs they say they have created in that time. About half of those net losses came from companies in the restaurant and leisure industries, the analysis found.
The Wage Story
Nearly a year after the cuts were signed into law, wage growth has yet to pick up when accounting for inflation. In September, the Labor Department reported that inflation-adjusted wages had risen 0.5 percent from the year before. That's a slower rate of growth than the economy itself experienced in September 2017, when it was 0.6 percent.
Growth has accelerated in nominal terms. Median wage growth was 3.5 percent in September, according to calculations by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, up from 3 percent in January, but still below its recent highs in 2016. Growth in the Employment Cost Index rose from 2.9 percent at the end of 2017 to 3 percent in the third quarter.
By Republicans' own economic theories, it should take a while for corporate tax cuts to translate into higher worker pay. First, the cuts need to stimulate increased capital investments, which in turn raise worker productivity. More productive workers would then see their wages rise accordingly.
Productivity grew 3 percent in the second quarter of this year and 2.2 percent in the third -- healthy numbers, which will need to continue apace to deliver the sort of long-term economic jolt Republicans promised.

At Theaters, 'Grinch' Rakes In the Green

Full text: LOS ANGELES -- The Grinch, 61 years old, may be "as cuddly as a cactus" and "as charming as an eel," to quote his creator. But slather him with high-fructose corn syrup (perky computer animation), roll him in a mega-marketing campaign (10 million Grinch-themed boxes shipped by Amazon alone), and the green critter is as sure a bet as there is in mass holiday entertainment.
"Dr. Seuss' The Grinch," based on the 1957 book "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" -- and following in the Whoville-hating footsteps of the classic TV special, a stage musical, and a live-action film starring Jim Carrey -- arrived in 4,141 theaters in North America over the weekend and took in a strong $66 million. The new film, with Benedict Cumberbatch leading the voice cast, cost Illumination Entertainment about $75 million to make and was distributed by Universal Pictures.
"Christmas came early this year," the studio said in a statement on Sunday. "The Grinch," marketed with Grinchy ads that poked fun at itself ("Another remake?! Hope you're proud Hollywood"), took in an additional $12.7 million from 23 overseas markets, according to Universal.

Domestic ticket sales for the movie were on par with those for the first installment in Illumination's blockbuster "Despicable Me" franchise. The first "Despicable Me" collected $56.4 million over its first three days in July 2010, or $66 million based on today's ticket prices. But "The Grinch" fell behind Illumination's "Dr. Seuss' The Lorax," which arrived to $78.2 million in ticket sales in March 2012, after adjusting for inflation.
Second place for the weekend went to the surprise smash hit "Bohemian Rhapsody" (20th Century Fox), which took in an estimated $30.9 million for a two-week domestic total of $100 million, according to Comscore, which compiles box-office data. Turnout overseas has been equally astonishing: "Bohemian Rhapsody," a musical biopic about Queen and its flamboyant frontman, Freddie Mercury, has collected an additional $185 million outside of the United States and Canada.
"Bohemian Rhapsody" has sparked renewed interest in Queen songs, benefiting an unusual owner of the music: Disney, which bought rights to the Queen catalog almost 30 years ago for its little-known Hollywood Records division.
Aside from "The Grinch," it was not a great weekend for new wide-release movies. "Overlord" (Paramount), a World War II horror thriller from a producing team that included J.J. Abrams, arrived to about $10.1 million in ticket sales, on the low end of prerelease expectations. "Overlord," which cost $38 million to make and tens of millions more to market, collected an additional $9.2 million in extensive release overseas.
"The Nutcracker and the Four Realms" (Disney) was fourth, taking in $9.6 million for a two-week domestic total of $35.3 million.
Rounding out the top five was "The Girl in the Spider's Web," which fizzled with about $8 million in ticket sales. Poor reviews likely held back "Spider's Web," an R-rated thriller based on the best-selling novel of the same name. The film cost Sony, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and New Regency roughly $43 million to make, not including marketing. Overseas, "Spider's Web," directed by Fede Alvarez, has collected $8.3 million.
On the plus side for Sony: "Venom," based on one of the lesser-known superheroes in Sony's stable, rolled out in China and took in a jaw-dropping $111 million, far surpassing opening-weekend totals for recent Marvel movies. Worldwide ticket sales for "Venom" now stand at $674 million.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text: Representative Dana Rohrabacher, a Republican fixture in California who represented Orange County for 15 terms, has lost his bid for re-election. His defeat underlines the party's setbacks in a part of the state that was long a symbol of its political dominance.
The Associated Press called the race on Saturday, with Harley Rouda receiving 52 percent of the vote to Mr. Rohrabacher's 48 percent.
Mr. Rouda, 56, is a former Republican turned Democrat who became a symbol of the Democratic efforts to win back Congress this year. Mr. Rohrabacher, 71, was viewed as particularly vulnerable because he defended Russia in the midst of allegations about its efforts to intervene in elections in the United States.
In July, Mr. Rohrabacher admitted to meeting with Maria Butina, who was charged by federal prosecutors this summer with conspiracy and acting as a foreign agent, during his trip to Russia in 2015. Mr. Rohrabacher was considered so valuable to the Kremlin that the F.B.I. warned him in 2012 that Russia regarded him as an intelligence source worthy of a code name. His support for President Vladimir Putin of Russia raised questions even among fellow Republicans.
Mr. Rouda capitalized on that in his campaign, running ads emphasizing Mr. Rohrabacher's Putin ties and criticizing Mr. Rohrabacher for questioning the assertion by United States intelligence agencies that Russia interfered in the 2016 election.
Mr. Rouda has said he is in favor of Medicare for All and a $15-an-hour federal minimum wage tied to inflation, along with free tuition at public colleges. In a post on Twitter after the race was called, he thanked his supporters "who dedicated countless hours to flipping" the 48th Congressional District. He told The Associated Press that he intended to be "honest, transparent, accessible and tireless" in Washington.
Democrats have focused on seven seats in California that were controlled by Republicans. The loss by Mr. Rohrabacher marks the third Democratic victory in those races.
On Saturday night, three other races remained too close to call.
Josh Harder, a Democrat, was ahead of Representative Jeff Denham by 1.9 percentage points in the 10th District. Representative Mimi Walters, a Republican, was leading Katie Porter by 0.9 percentage point in the 45th District. And Young Kim, a Republican, was beating Gil Cisneros by 1.4 percentage points in a race to replace Representative Ed Royce, a Republican who is retiring from the 39th District seat.
Support for Republicans has been steadily eroding in Orange County; in 2016, Hillary Clinton became the first Democratic presidential candidate to win there since the Great Depression. Roughly a third of voters in the county are registered Republicans, down from more than half in 1990. About 30 percent of voters in the district are not registered with either party.

Full text: Stocks in the United States slipped Thursday as the ninth consecutive drop in crude oil prices hurt energy companies. Markets were coming off huge gains the day before.
United States crude oil has now slumped more than 20 percent since early October, meeting Wall Street's definition of a "bear market."
Government fuel stockpiles have steadily expanded, pushing supplies higher, and the United States issued waivers to a number of countries that buy oil from Iran. That allows those countries to keep importing Iranian oil in spite of renewed sanctions on that country.
Most other groups of stocks finished little changed. Banks made the largest gains. The Federal Reserve left interest rates where they are, but suggested it plans to keep raising rates in response to the strong United States economy.
After its steep plunge in October, the S&P 500 had risen for six of the seven days ending on Wednesday. Stocks started sinking last month because investors worried that the Fed was going to raise interest rates to the point they slowed down economic growth. But John Lynch, chief investment strategist at LPL Research, said he does not think that is going to happen and that the Fed will stop raising rates in 2019.
"We do not believe they will be as aggressive as many fear," he said. "We still don't have anything approaching the wage pressures that have historically scared the Fed."
The S&P 500 index shed 7.06 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,806.83 after it jumped 2.1 percent Wednesday. The Dow Jones industrial average inched up 10.92 points to 26,191.22. The Nasdaq composite dipped 39.87 points, or 0.5 percent, to 7,530.89 after a 2.6 percent surge a day earlier.
Benchmark United States crude oil fell 1.6 percent to $60.67 a barrel in New York. On Oct. 3 it closed at $76.41, the highest level in almost four years.
Brent crude lost $1.00 to $60.67 a barrel in London. Brent crude is the standard for international oil prices and it has also fallen sharply over the last five weeks.
Exxon Mobil fell 1.6 percent to $81.71 and ConocoPhillips gave up 4.5 percent to $119.36.
Bond prices held steady. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was unchanged at 3.24 percent, near its highest level this year. The Federal Reserve left interest rates where they are, but suggested it plans to keep raising them in response to the strong United States economy. The Fed has raised its key rate eight times since late 2015 and is expected to do so again in December, with several more increases to follow.
Bank of America rose 1.2 percent to $28.87 and M&T Bank added 1.2 percent to $167.37.
The Fed has been raising rates to prevent inflation from getting out of hand. Mr. Lynch, of LPL, said that inflation is not going to get much stronger because wages are not going to grow much faster than they currently are. He said factors like the retirement of more baby boomers, global competition and slower economic growth in the United States will all limit increases in pay.
Chip-maker Qualcomm had a strong fourth quarter, but for the current period it is projecting revenue of $4.5 billion to $5.3 billion, far below the $5.6 billion analysts expected, according to FactSet. Its stock lost 8.2 percent to $58.05.
Apple stopped making royalty payments to Qualcomm following a dispute between the companies, and later decided to stop using Qualcomm modems in some of its products. Qualcomm said both of those changes have hurt its results.
D.R. Horton, one of the largest homebuilders, fell 9 percent to $34.22 after its earnings and sales fell short of Wall Street forecasts. The company said rising home prices and mortgage rates are affecting demand. That exact combination has been weighing on home sales and the stocks all year. PulteGroup fell 3.5 percent to $24.23 and Lennar lost 2.5 percent to $41.90.
Wynn Resorts dropped 13.1 percent to $99.02 after the casino operator said its business in Macau has slowed down recently.
Stocks climbed Wednesday after the midterm elections generally went the way investors thought they would. The Democrats took control of the House of Representatives while the Republicans held on to a majority in the Senate. That means that politics appears that much less likely to crowd out the performance of the strong United States economy.
In other commodities trading, wholesale gasoline was little changed at $1.64 a gallon. Heating oil dropped 3.1 percent to $2.17 a gallon. Natural gas edged down to $3.54 per 1,000 cubic feet.
Gold fell $3.30 to $1,222.90 an ounce. Silver lost 1 percent to $14.42 an ounce. Copper slipped 0.7 percent to $2.74 a pound.
The dollar rose to 113.96 yen from 113.34 yen. The euro fell to $1.1359 from $1.1437.

Full text: U.S. stocks rose Tuesday as industrial and technology companies recovered some of the big losses they took over the last month. Strong company earnings also contributed to the gains, but stocks stayed calm as traders waited for results from the midterm elections in the U.S.
Industrial and basic materials companies made some of the biggest gains following reports from fertilizer maker Mosaic and granite, limestone, sand and gravel seller Martin Marietta Materials. Bond prices dipped, sending yields higher. Oil prices continued to fall, extending four weeks of losses. British stocks fell as negotiators from the U.K. and European Union as remained deadlocked over the issue of Ireland's borders.
The midterm elections will determine control of the House of Representatives and Senate, and 36 governorships are being contested along with other state and local positions. The vote could affect U.S. trade, economic and security policies.
Alicia Levine, chief market strategist at BNY Mellon Investment Management, said some of the most dramatic reactions to the elections might be seen in the health care sector, as Republicans could make another attempt to eliminate the 2010 Affordable Care Act if they keep control of the House and Senate.
"If the Democrats take the House, the Affordable Care Act is not under threat of being repealed," she said, which could help health insurers and hospitals. "If we see the Democrats take the governors houses, you could also see the expansion of Medicaid."
A Democratic House majority might work with the administration to try to reduce drug prices, and would take a more lenient approach on food stamp benefits. That could help big box stores and grocery chains, which get a lot of revenue from those programs.
If Republicans keep control of the House, Levine said, they might index capital gains taxes to inflation, which would effectively cut those taxes. While that could boost the economy, it would also encourage the Federal Reserve to keep raising interest rates at a faster pace, and investors are already concerned that rates could rise too fast.
The S&P 500 index rose 17.14 points, or 0.6 percent, to 2,755.45. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 173.31 points, or 0.7 percent, to 25,635.01. The Nasdaq composite picked up 47.11 points, or 0.6 percent, to 7,375.96. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks added 8.59 points, or 0.6 percent, to 1,556.10.
Stocks dropped in October and recovered a sliver of their gains during a three-day rally last week. They made smaller moves over the final few days before the polls closed. Stocks tend to fall before midterm elections and then rally once the voting is over. The S&P 500 has generated an average price return of 16.7 percent in the 12 months after midterm elections since 1946, according to CFRA.
Drugstore and pharmacy benefits manager CVS Health rose 5.7 percent to $77.90 after its results topped Wall Street forecasts in the third quarter. It was helped by a large bump in prescriptions. CVS also said it expects to complete its purchase of health insurer Aetna before the Thanksgiving holiday.
Symantec rallied after the security software maker said it bought two smaller companies. It didn't disclose terms. Shares of Symantec rose further after Reuters reported that private equity firm Thoma Bravo is interested in buying the company. The stock jumped 12.6 percent to $22.54.
Among materials companies, Mosaic rose 10.6 percent to $35.64 after it raised its annual profit forecast, and Martin Marietta climbed 8.4 percent to $189.55. Construction materials company Vulcan gained 3.5 percent to $104.12.
Industrial companies also rose. Caterpillar climbed 2.3 percent to $129.33 and Boeing added 1.2 percent to $366.47.
Oil prices continued to slip after the U.S. said it would allow a group of allies to continue buying oil from Iran as long as they continued to try to reduce their imports from that nation. The U.S. reinstated sanctions on Iran this month after withdrawing from an international agreement intended to curb Iran's nuclear program, and analysts feared that oil prices would jump as supplies tightened.
Benchmark U.S. crude oil fell 1.4 percent to $62.21 a barrel in New York. In early October it traded above $76 a barrel. Brent crude dipped 1.4 percent to $72.13 a barrel in London.
Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 3.22 percent from 3.19 percent.
Britain's FTSE 100 shed 0.9 percent as Britain and the EU tried to resolve their differences over the Irish border. The two sides are trying to find a way to make sure there are no customs posts or other checks on the border between EU member Ireland and Northern Ireland, which will leave the group along with the rest of the U.K.
In France, the CAC 40 fell 0.5 percent. Germany's DAX dipped 0.1 percent.
In other commodities trading, wholesale gasoline was little changed at $1.69 a gallon and heating oil was also little changed at $2.19 a gallon. Natural gas remained at $3.56 per 1,000 cubic feet.
Gold shed 0.5 percent to $1,226.30 an ounce. Silver lost 1 percent to $14.50 an ounce. Copper fell 0.9 percent to $2.73 a pound.
The dollar rose to 113.40 yen from 113.21 yen. The euro slipped to $1.1413 from $1.1418.
Japan's Nikkei 225 index rose 1.1 percent and the Kospi in South Korea added 0.6 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng bounced gained 0.7 percent.

Full text: Teodoro Petkoff, a fiercely independent Venezuelan political figure -- whose cinematic trajectory from armed Marxist guerrilla to government minister to apostate under the country's socialist president, Hugo Chavez, reflected the evolution of the Latin American left -- died on Oct. 31 in Caracas. He was 86.
His death was announced by Tal Cual (Like It Is), the maverick newspaper he founded in 2000, which said he had been ailing since he was injured in a fall in 2012.
"He is a bold politician, with an energy that is felt even in a handshake," the novelist Gabriel García Márquez wrote of Mr. Petkoff in the Spanish newspaper El País in 1983, "but all his actions are commanded by common sense."
In a political career that spanned six decades, Mr. Petkoff fled escape-proof prisons twice, unsuccessfully sought the presidency three times and metamorphosed into an intellectual elder statesman.
"His life covered every step," Jorge Castañeda, a former foreign minister of Mexico and a professor at New York University, said in a telephone interview, "from Cuban-sponsored guerrilla fighter in the early '60s, to democratic socialism in the '70s, to becoming in the '80s and '90s a critic of the corrupt Venezuelan political system and someone trying to fix it without breaking it."
Mr. Petkoff became "constructively critical" of Mr. Chavez after he took office in 1999 but later sharpened his critique "to the point that his newspaper was shut down and he was the victim of constant harassment," Professor Castañeda, the author of "Utopia Unarmed: The Latin American Left After the Cold War" (1993), said.
"If you look at the Latin American left from the early 1960s you can see the same evolution -- less so in Venezuela," he continued. "He certainly both reflected that evolution and contributed to that evolution."
Mr. Petkoff joined the Communist Party in 1950, when he was an 18-year-old college student. But his abandonment of the armed struggle against a United States-supported government by the late 1960s prompted a rebuke from Fidel Castro, who denounced him and his former rebels as "traitors, temporizers and cowards." His disillusionment after the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 provoked Leonid I. Brezhnev, the Soviet leader, to denounce him as a "heretic."
Mr. Petkoff banded together with former guerrillas to establish the Movement Toward Socialism party in the early 1970s and embraced what he described as "democratic pluralism." He was elected to the Senate, but was swamped by multiple opponents when he sought the presidency in 1983 and 1988.
In the late 1990s, he served as planning minister under President Rafael Caldera. He was credited by Wall Street and the International Monetary Fund with returning state-run companies to private ownership, shrinking the bureaucracy and curbing inflation while improving social programs.
In 1998, he bolted the political party he had founded because it endorsed Mr. Chavez's presidential candidacy. In 2006, Mr. Petkoff mounted his third presidential campaign, a short-lived challenge to Mr. Chavez, by then an authoritarian firebrand, who successfully sought re-election and died in office in 2013.
By then Mr. Petkoff had became a full-time journalist, a job in which he won the prestigious María Moors Cabot and Ortega y Gasset prizes. He also wrote about a dozen books.
"He leaves Venezuela and the region without a mandate on social commitment, political coherence and defense of democratic values," Luis Almagro, secretary general of the Organization of American States, said on Twitter. "His struggle for freedom of expression and defense of human rights will never be forgotten."
Teodoro Petkoff Malec was born on Jan. 3, 1932, in El Batey, a community in Zulia State in northwestern Venezuela, to immigrants who had arrived in the 1920s. His father was from Bulgaria. His mother, who was Jewish, had immigrated from Poland.
He graduated with a bachelor's degree in economics from Central University of Venezuela in Caracas, where he later taught, and where he enlisted in the rebel movement that unseated the military dictator Marcos Perez Jimenez in 1958.
Complete information on survivors was not immediately available.
Twice in the 1960s, when he was being held for illegal Communist and guerrilla activity, Mr. Petkoff escaped from prison. On one occasion, he fled into a crowd of masked revelers on carnival night through a tunnel dug by fellow Communists from a grocery about 220 feet from his cell. On another, he swallowed a capsule of cow's blood to feign a gastric ulcer to get himself transferred to a less secure prison hospital and rappelled from a seventh-floor window by rope.
Just how much Venezuelan politics, and Mr. Petkoff, had matured since then was apparent from an anecdote he told about himself.
In 1980 he was attending a cocktail party, he told The New York Times, when he encountered a military man whom he had last seen 17 years earlier, when he was making his escape from the hospital window. As Mr. Petkoff was lowering himself, he recalled, he passed an officer who was gazing at him from the other side of a closed window. When Mr. Petkoff raised a finger to his lips, the officer instinctively remained silent.
"At the party, the officer told me that he had no idea I was an inmate escaping," Mr. Petkoff said. "He told me that if he had known I was Petkoff, he would have emptied his revolver into me."

Full text: Donald Trump's conservative critics have one last hope: defeat. If Republicans suffer humiliating defeats in the midterm elections, they suggest, President Trump will get the blame. Influential donors and grass-roots Republicans will turn on him, and the party will get back to normal. Not so long ago this was the party of Paul Ryan and free trade. This was the party of George W. Bush and compassionate conservatism. This was a party whose self-performed autopsy after the 2012 election called for more minority outreach. After Mr. Trump, why can't the Republicans be that party again? The ranks of anti-Trump Republicans grow thinner by the day. They're retiring from Congress. They're writing memoirs blasting their former friends. But they hold out hope for the future. If the Republican Party could undergo such a profound change in personality and policy thanks to just one man in a mere three years, who's to say it can't change back? The Trump coalition seems so impermanent, after all, a motley mix of Southern evangelicals, businessmen who think like the Chamber of Commerce and disaffected white voters from the Rust Belt. Throw in foreign-policy hawks and anti-interventionist America Firsters, and Mr. Trump's Republican Party looks like an impossible contradiction. It can't last. Can it?
Yes, it can. In fact, the party that President Trump has remade in his image is arguably less divided and in a better position to keep winning the White House than it has been at any time since the 1980s. What Mr. Trump has done is to rediscover the formula that made the landslide Republican Electoral College victories of the Nixon and Reagan years possible. Mr. Trump's signature themes of economic nationalism and immigration restriction are only 21st-century updates to the issues that brought the Republican Party triumph in all but one of the six presidential elections between 1968 and 1988.
Some of the parallels are obvious. President Trump talks about crime and left-wing agitation in much the same way that Richard Nixon once did -- and Ronald Reagan, too, especially during his time as governor of California. Mr. Trump's combination of force with an aversion to large-scale military interventions and nation-building also bears a resemblance to the policies of Republican presidents past. Dwight Eisenhower and Mr. Reagan also preferred to build up military strength without engaging in the kinds of prolonged wars for which Lyndon Johnson and George W. Bush are remembered. And while Mr. Nixon was mired in Vietnam, he ran as a candidate eager to find an exit.
Mr. Trump's willingness to deal with even as repellent a dictator as Kim Jong-un has a precedent in the creative diplomacy pursued by Mr. Nixon with Mao Zedong. If Mr. Trump is mocked for saying that he fell in love with Mr. Kim after an exchange of letters, Mr. Reagan was once mocked, too, and by conservatives at that, for his love affair with Mikhail Gorbachev. The foreign leaders may be very different, but the strong Republican's openness to negotiation is not.
But the most important ways in which Mr. Trump recapitulates the winning themes of earlier Republicans are less direct. Throughout the Cold War, Republicans presented themselves as the party of greater nationalism in the struggle against a global threat. If the United States was to survive in a world that seemed increasingly subjugated by international Communism, the country would have to embrace the party that was most anti-Communist.
The Soviet Union is long gone, but our national distinctiveness -- the American way of life -- is perceived to be under threat by new global forces, this time in the form of competition from China and international economic and regulatory bodies that compromise national sovereignty. Many voters see immigration as part of this story. They want America to control its borders by political choice, not to admit more immigrants because a global labor market insists that more must come for the good of all.
Even in the area where Mr. Trump seems most different from Republicans past, on trade, he has really returned to an older style of politics. Mr. Reagan was an economic nationalist, too, not just because he protected a company like Harley-Davidson against competition from Japan but more important because his pro-growth policies of deregulation and tax cuts were themselves the appropriate forms of economic nationalism for the 1980s. In the decades before the rise of China as an industrial superpower, economic nationalism was chiefly a matter of keeping the American economy entrepreneurial -- defending it against red tape and business-unfriendly policies at home rather than the predatory economic strategies of foreign governments.
By the early 1990s, the Reagan economic strategy -- a mix of entrepreneurship, tough bargaining and limited protection -- had succeeded against stiff competition from Japan. That victory was squandered, however, by Republicans and Democrats starting later in that decade who pursued economic policy not in terms of national industry but as an exercise in global ideological consumerism.
The Republican Party began in the 19th century as a free-labor party, built on the interest of workers who did not want to compete with the cheaper labor of an expanding slave economy. After the Civil War, the Republicans were the party of industry and protection, which also made it the party of jobs. Only the Great Depression brought an end to the dominance that Republicans long enjoyed as a result. After World War II, Republicans failed when they made feints in the direction of overthrowing the New Deal. The Democrats became the party of industry and jobs, until inflation and stagnation created an opening for a new Republican business strategy. And it was a strategy -- not an ideological doctrine.
The business side of President Trump's coalition still puts its bottom line ahead of its theoretical commitments: Mr. Trump has produced a very good environment for business, no matter what the business executives think about his tariffs. They want to win elections so that they can continue to prosper, and if that means electing more protectionists after Mr. Trump, that is a price they are readily willing to pay.
Grass-roots evangelical Christians and Rust Belt workers, meanwhile, both find something to like in an America that reaffirms its economic exceptionalism and sovereignty. That, no less than Mr. Trump's loyalty to Christian conservatives on abortion and other issues, is why evangelical voters have not abandoned him. And it's why Mr. Trump won states like Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania that had eluded other Republican presidential nominees since 1988.
Few Republicans running this year seem to understand what gave Mr. Trump his edge in 2016 -- it was not that he was simply combative and rhetorically right-wing. It was that he had a vision of what it meant to make American great again, by making the Republicans a party for the nation again.

Full text: The United States economy is the strongest it has been in ages. Growth has been robust, and the unemployment rate is at generational lows, as new data Friday affirmed. Yet the Republican Party, which controls the White House and Congress, trails Democrats substantially in polling on which party is preferred.
It helps to look beyond the overall economic data to understand this disconnect. After all, you can't eat G.D.P., and good jobs numbers aren't the same as a place to live.
If you look instead at the actual financial lives of average middle-income families from 2016 -- their incomes, spending, assets and debt -- and how shifts since Election Day in 2016 would have been likely to affect them, you get a more mixed picture.
Wages haven't risen much. Inflation has been low, helping keep the price of most staple goods down, though with gasoline prices a costly exception. The tax cut has left more money in most middle-class families' pockets, but only a bit.
In terms of assets, the typical middle-income family has either zero or minimal holdings in the stock market, meaning the surge since November 2016 hasn't paid direct benefits. But a majority of households in this income bracket do carry some credit card debt, which has become more expensive amid rising interest rates.
And in terms of housing costs, rents haven't risen much -- but a sharp rise in mortgage rates has made homes less affordable for anyone looking to buy.
Add it all up, and while the benefits of a surging economy, tax cuts and the rising stock market are real, they net out to a less favorable economic reality for a family in the middle of the income scale than the economic headlines might imply.
This math is oversimplified -- it doesn't reflect how families may have changed their spending and saving patterns in the last two years, and conflates different definitions of middle income. But the back-of-the-envelope results are revealing:
If you take the benefits of higher wages and the lower taxes, subtracting higher costs for consumer goods and higher interest rates on credit card debt -- it works out to a gain of $122 a month.
Slow wage growth, a boost from tax cuts, low inflation
A lower unemployment rate may benefit workers by making it easier for someone who loses a job to find a new one. But a defining feature of the expansion for years has been relatively tepid growth in wages.
The median pay for a full-time worker in the United States -- now $893 a week -- has risen enough since late 2016 to generate an extra $204 a month in pretax earnings for a household with a single earner, a 5.6 percent gain.
Subtract payroll taxes and federal income taxes on that raise, and that family is looking at $158 a month in additional earnings.
The tax cuts enacted at the start of 2018 should mean most middle-income Americans keep a bit more of their earnings. Analysis by the Tax Policy Center found that of the 91 percent of middle-income tax filers who received a tax cut, the reduction averages $910, or about $76 a month.
Wages may not be growing very fast for middle-income people, but the good news is that prices of most of the things they buy have been rising even more slowly.
The Consumer Price Index excluding housing costs is up only 3.2 percent since November 2016, adding about $101 to the monthly expenses of a family with spending patterns that match those of an average family in the middle 20 percent of the income distribution that year.
When you look at individual items that compose a large portion of family budgets, the relatively low inflation comes through.
Grocery prices -- "food at home" in the Labor Department's terminology -- are up only 1.1 percent in the nearly two years since November 2016, adding $3.33 to the monthly grocery bill for an average family in the middle 20 percent of income.
Outside of food, the pattern mostly recurs. Electricity bills are up 0.42 percent, a mere 50 cents a month of additional expense. Apparel is slightly less expensive than it was in November 2016, saving a middle-class family $1.22 a month. An 11 percent drop in the price of cellphone service saves that family $10.48 each month.
The big exception is gasoline; its price has been marching steadily higher since late 2016. The 23.5 percent run-up in the price of motor fuels adds $37.38 to the typical family's monthly expenses.
Fine time for renters, but higher rates hurt would-be buyers
When it comes to housing, it matters a lot whether you're renting and planning to continue renting; renting but seeking to buy a home; or already own one.
For renters who plan to stay renters, costs are rising modestly, just like overall inflation -- 3 percent since November 2016, tacking an extra $26.54 onto monthly costs for the average renter.
Homeowners typically have their monthly mortgage costs already set. Their wealth -- the value of their home -- has risen a bit in two years. The median sale price for a home in the United States was $214,000 in November 2016, according to data from Zillow, and the national appreciation rate since then implies such a house would now be worth $230,000.
Things are trickier for a renter looking to buy a home, because of rising mortgage rates. A side effect of the surging economy and deficit-increasing tax cuts has been higher rates, which means that even though home prices aren't up all that much in the last two years, the cost for a buyer needing credit is considerably higher.
The rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 3.5 percent at election time two years ago, and is now 4.83 percent. Combined with the rise in the price of the median home, a middle-income American family looking to buy with 20 percent down would be looking at a monthly mortgage payment that is $196 a month higher now than in November 2016, wiping out gains from higher wages and lower taxes.
A market boom for a few, and higher interest rates for others
The Trump administration has pointed to the booming stock market as evidence of success: The Standard & Poor's 500 index has returned about 29 percent, including reinvested dividends, since November 2016.
But middle-income families typically have minimal direct exposure to the stock market. Their financial holdings tend to be modest at best, meaning that rising stock prices create only a small wealth increase.
Among middle-income families in 2016, only 52 percent held stocks either directly or indirectly, such as through a mutual fund. And of those 52 percent, median stock holdings were only $15,000. (That would be up to around $19,000 now if they left the money in an S.&P. 500 index fund since then without making further contributions.)
Stock investments are much more a feature of upper-income brackets. The same survey showed that 94.7 percent of families in the top 10 percent of income held stocks, with a median value of $363,400.
Many middle-income Americans, 84.3 percent of them, do tend to hold some form of debt. And rising interest rates in the Trump economy -- a consequence of strong economic growth and Federal Reserve actions meant to prevent the economy from overheating -- are making that debt more costly.
In 2016, 53 percent of middle-income households had credit card debt, with an average debt balance of $4,400. The average rate on such debt has risen to 16.5 percent today from 13.6 percent in November 2016, implying an extra $10.50 a month in interest cost for a family carrying that balance.
In other words, debtors -- and the average middle-class American fits that description -- are paying a price for the surging economy even as they enjoy the benefits of higher pay and low inflation.
Given the limitations in the data on which these calculations are based, it's best to think of this analysis as an impressionistic painting rather than a high-resolution photograph of the economic lives of the middle class.
But it is a telling one, and helps explains the limits of a political message built on what seems to be a booming economy. It booms for some people more than others.
How we did the math
To develop this portrait, we started with two government surveys from 2016: the Labor Department's Consumer Expenditure Survey, which provides details of household spending patterns broken down by income bracket, and the Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances, which details assets and debt.
Then, we simply extrapolated forward to the fall of 2018. If those patterns among middle-class families held steady as they were buffeted by economywide forces, would they be better or worse off in the days before the midterms?
This is assuming that they had no radical changes to their financial lives like getting a lucrative new job or winning the lottery, and that their wages, costs and investment performances plugged along at average rates over the last 23 months.
Because of limitations in the data available for the recent past, we had to combine data sources that aren't really meant to be combined. We had to switch between different definitions of middle income, and we made some simplifying assumptions. (For example, we calculated how higher gasoline prices would increase people's spending without adjusting for how they might react to higher prices by driving less.)

As Midterms Approach, Keep an Eye on the Market

Full text: There has been a deficit of cheerful news lately about American politics. And with the midterm elections looming, it may be difficult to think clearly about anything else.
So here's a tidbit that may be diverting and even mildly comforting: The midterms have consistently been good for the stock market.
Remarkably, this has been true for every midterm election since World War II.
The data shows that it hasn't mattered who won or lost or which party controlled the White House or Congress, either before the voting or as a result of it. Whatever the political configuration or the election results, the midterm election season has been an excellent one for stocks.
The pattern "gives a very positive message for the market," said Ed Clissold, chief United States Strategist for Ned Davis Research. "It's only part of the picture, but it's a positive part."
The numbers tell the story. Since 1946, in years with midterm elections, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has gained a median of 18.4 percent in the nine-month period from Sept. 30, just ahead of voting, through June 30 of the following year, according to data compiled by Ned Davis Research. In that same period in nonvoting years, the index gained 4.9 percent.
Diving a little deeper into the Ned Davis data, the pattern is evident when presidential terms are broken down into three-month quarters. Each four-year presidential term has 16 quarters, and the best one has typically been the quarter we are in now, the fourth quarter of a midterm year.
In this midterm quarter, the stock index since 1946 has gained 7.5 percent on average. The next best two quarters in performance have been the next two quarters chronologically -- the first and second quarters in the year after the midterm election -- with average gains of 7.5 percent and 6.6 percent.
There have been declines within these periods -- including one, in 1946, as large as a 15.4 percent loss -- but in every case, the net result for the nine-month midterm season was a market gain.
But why? That's the problem with this pattern: Because presidential motivations and actions aren't sufficiently documented, there is no conclusive explanation, though a great deal of academic work has been done on this subject, as I've written just before the last two midterm elections.
The main working hypothesis is a cynical one: Presidents are politicians who care overwhelmingly about their own re-election. (And to a much lesser extent, two-term presidents look to ensure the election of their successors.) They stimulate the economy -- and, indirectly, the stock market -- for maximum effect as their own elections grow closer, or so the theory goes.
That implies that their first year in office is the best time to make politically painful moves, which won't hurt them in the polls later. And it follows that it's better to gin up the economy in the second half of their tenure, starting around the midterms. If the good times are going to roll, let them roll closer to a presidential election.
Cause and effect have been difficult to prove. The one case with a smoking gun occurred, naturally enough, in the Nixon administration.
Secret White House tapes, combined with the investigations of the special prosecutor and the House Judiciary Committee, as well as efforts by private individuals and researchers, are gradually giving us a more precise view of the internal workings of the government in that era than is available for other administrations.
Thanks to those Nixon White House tapes, Burton A. Abrams, an economics professor at the University of Delaware, has shown that in 1971 and early in the 1972 election year, President Richard Nixon secretly pressured the Federal Reserve chairman, Arthur F. Burns, to expand the money supply, with the goal of ensuring Mr. Nixon's second term.
Mr. Nixon took other actions, including the imposition of wage and price controls to curb inflation, all aimed at improving his standing in the polls. And he crushed Senator George McGovern in the presidential election of 1972.
In some cases, however, presidents appeared to act against their own self-interest in economic matters. In retrospect, President Jimmy Carter's appointment of Paul Volcker as chairman of the Federal Reserve in July 1979 may be seen in this light, as a public-spirited sacrifice.
Mr. Volcker's tight monetary policy reined in the rampant inflation of the era, but also helped to start the recession that lasted from January through July in 1980 -- and doomed President Carter's bid for a second term. (The Iran hostage crisis didn't help, of course.) Carter lost to Ronald Reagan in November 1980.
Still, the patterns in the stock market over a very long period appear to be persuasive. (Even for Mr. Carter, the stock market eked out a small gain, 0.4 percent, in the midterm election quarter.)
But even if the overall pattern is more than an elaborate series of coincidences, and even if presidential self-interest causes it, it's possible that President Trump may be so singular that little of this applies.
For one thing, the administration's timing on economic matters seems to have been off, as far as this stock market cycle goes. Last winter's tax cut and the current, widening budget deficit have stimulated the economy, but way ahead of the typical schedule -- so far ahead, in fact, that they may not help Mr. Trump's re-election odds in 2020.
The Federal Reserve is already raising interest rates and is expected to continue through next year, which could slow the economy as the presidential election approaches. Despite the Fed's independent status, Mr. Trump has repeatedly criticized the central bank's moves, with no apparent effect so far.
The stock market often moves ahead of the economy, responding to changing expectations. Because the economy -- and corporate earnings -- have been so strong lately, year-over-year comparisons are widely expected be less favorable in 2019.
By 2020, many strategists say, the chances of a recession are mounting. And with the prospect of declining growth rates ahead, the market has given up gains lately, and bullish Wall Street forecasters have been lowering their targets.
Of course, the Fed could back off if the economy slackens. And the administration could engage in further fiscal stimulus after the midterms by enacting one of its campaign promises, a big infrastructure investment plan. But its ability to do so depends on the election results. So will its ability to meet another stated goal, further tax cuts.
Will the midterm pattern be sustained once more? Its overwhelming consistency is formidable. But so is Mr. Trump's ability to shatter convention.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- President Trump has yet to follow through on a threat to cut off hundreds of millions of dollars in annual aid to three Central American nations from which migrants and refugees are moving toward the United States border, according to the head of the main American foreign aid agency. "I'm not aware of firm decisions being made," Mark Green, the administrator of the United States Agency for International Development, said Friday during a wide-ranging interview at his office a few blocks southeast of the White House. "I know it's under review."
The lack of action calls into question whether Mr. Trump actually intends to punish the three countries, Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, for failing to stop the migrants, or whether his remarks are just political grandstanding. With Republican control of the House in peril in the midterm elections on Tuesday, the president has escalated his anti-immigrant messaging to appeal to voters.
The aid agency, known as U.S.A.I.D., has supplied data to White House officials that lay out programs and amounts of aid given to those three countries, as is typical.
"It's true that the White House is taking a close look at all assistance that is provided to these three countries," said Mr. Green, a former ambassador and Republican congressman from Wisconsin. "Quite frankly, that's not unusual. We're constantly examining and re-examining our assistance programs."
Mr. Green pointed to a separate refugee movement, in Venezuela, as a crisis of historic proportions that his agency was trying to help address.
As the economy in Venezuela has collapsed and inflation has risen sharply under President Nicolás Maduro, two million to three million people have fled the country in recent years.
"The consequences of this mass movement I think are serious," Mr. Green said. "I think they'll have consequences for economies. They'll certainly have humanitarian consequences."
The United States has announced several times this year that it will give tens of millions of dollars in aid to Venezuela's neighbors -- notably Colombia -- to help the refugees. In total, more than $96 million, intended mainly for food and health aid, has been dedicated to the effort.
Some have argued the United States should give more.
The United States will continue responding to requests for humanitarian aid from those countries, and will evaluate needs each time, Mr. Green said.
In mid-October, a Navy hospital ship, the Comfort, left Norfolk, Va., on a four-month deployment in Latin America to help Venezuelan refugees. On a visit to Panama and Mexico last month, Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, talked about the ship's role in providing medical aid.
Mr. Trump has made Venezuela a campaign topic, falsely claiming that Democrats want to carry out socialist policies like those that have wrecked the Venezuelan economy. But in recent weeks, he has made a much bigger issue of the Central American migrants and refugees, describing a slowly approaching caravan as an "invasion of our country."
At campaign rallies and on Twitter, the president has consistently demonized the group. The caravan, swelling to 7,000 at one point, has dwindled in size as it travels north. Only a small number are expected to reach the United States-Mexico border, but Mr. Trump has threatened to send up to 15,000 military troops there.
The president also suggested he would cut off aid, saying on Twitter last month: "Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador were not able to do the job of stopping people from leaving their country and coming illegally to the U.S. We will now begin cutting off, or substantially reducing, the massive foreign aid routinely given to them."
Mr. Green said Mr. Trump had not spoken to him about ending or reducing the aid. He said that the topic of aid to the Central American nations had come up at meetings with other agencies, but that it was one of a range of issues under discussion.
"To be honest, there are a lot of things that are high on the agenda," he said. "So sure, I mean, we're asked about Central America, we're asked about the Indo-Pacific strategy. This is a very active time for all of us who are involved in foreign policy, including development assistance."
Mr. Trump and senior officials have cut off aid or threatened to cut off aid to nations or to populations as a way to try to gain leverage on policy negotiations. For example, the State Department is barring American humanitarian aid workers from entering North Korea during negotiations over Pyongyang's nuclear program.
And the White House has ended all civilian aid to Palestinians this year, citing their refusal to negotiate with the Americans and Israelis. Palestinian officials took a hard stand after Mr. Trump announced last year that the United States Embassy would move to Jerusalem; the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state.
Asked whether the Trump White House had generally embraced a strategy of withholding or threatening to withhold aid to meet policy goals, Mr. Green pointed to American interests.
"Our job is to be a vibrant tool in the toolbox of American foreign policy," Mr. Green said. "Foreign assistance must always serve American interests."

Full text: Win, lose or draw on Tuesday, the Democratic Party will almost immediately turn its focus to the next presidential election and the fight between the establishment center and the left wing. But while the Democrats have that argument, they must also undertake the far more important task of thinking about what they agree on, and how they can construct a story about how the economy works and grows and spreads prosperity, a story that competes with -- and defeats -- the Republicans' own narrative. For 40 years, with a few exceptions, Democrats have utterly failed to do so. Until they fix this, they will lose economic arguments to the Republicans -- even though majorities disagree with the Republicans on many questions -- because every economic debate will proceed from Republican assumptions that make it all but impossible for Democrats to argue their case forcefully.
Republicans have a theory and a story about how the economy grows. You know it as supply-side economics: Cutting taxes, especially on the rich, and decreasing regulation will unleash so much innovation and economic activity that tax revenues will actually increase and the entire economy will benefit.
This has been the conservative story, which the right has elevated to veritable religion, for 30 or 40 years now. And the Democrats' alternative story is ... what? If you're not recalling it, that's because there isn't one.
The Democrats have impulses, they have beliefs, they even have principles. But they don't have a story to challenge the supply-side story and tell people about how the economy grows and helps everyone.
They used to, once upon a time. It was called Keynesianism, or sometimes demand-side economics (which is why conservatives named their theory supply-side). Keynesianism -- in a nutshell, government investment in public goods increase demand and prosperity -- held sway from the 1940s through the 1970s, the greatest period of economic growth in history.
Then came stagflation, which opened the door for the supply-siders. Democrats, by and large, stopped talking about theories. Their story was discredited, so the supply-siders said. Democrats stopped defending public investment, and they stopped defending government.
They still defend particular investments that poll well, like infrastructure spending. And they defend specific programs when they know they're on safe ground, like Social Security and Medicare. And now that Obamacare, or at least the part about making insurers cover people with pre-existing conditions, is registering positive numbers, they're happy to defend it, as they should.
But none of this amounts to an answer to supply-side economics. None of it creates an alternative story about how prosperity is spread.
It seems to me that the Democrats' story has to be built around the simple idea of investing in middle- and working-class people. Not "spending," but "investing." Spending sounds profligate; investing sounds prudent.
This is not to be done for reasons of "fairness." That's an absolutely vital point. Liberals reflexively want to make economic arguments about fairness. But this persuades only liberals. People who aren't liberals -- three-quarters of the country -- don't especially care about fairness. They do, however, care about growth. So Democrats need to argue that these investments, not tax cuts for the rich, are the way to spur growth.
Such an argument stands in direct contrast to the right's story. Republicans say the rich, with millions returned to them in the form of tax cuts, know best what to do with their money and the market can make the best decisions about investments and society's needs.
It should be fairly easy for Democrats to say to Americans: Look around you. How has that worked out for you?
Inequality is rampant. People fear being bankrupted by medical catastrophe (though not as much as they once did, thanks to President Barack Obama). Young people in college spend 25 years paying off debt. Young people not in college are working three jobs, none of which pays benefits or gives them steady hours. Your town is probably a shell of its former self, and some of your friends and relatives -- all of them good, decent people -- are in the grip of heroin or fentanyl addiction. This is what 40 years of market decision-making has done.
(By the way, the supply-siders' big promise about revenue was a fairy tale. The Bush tax cuts cost the Treasury at least $1.7 trillion. And the Trump tax cut has blown a new hole in the deficit, which Republicans want to patch, naturally, by cutting middle-class entitlements.)
So that's the easy half of the story -- criticizing supply-side's failures. The harder half is making the affirmative case for the Democratic theory of growth.
It shouldn't be so hard. Take, again, wages. Expanding overtime pay, raising wages, even doing something about the enormous and under-discussed problem of wage theft -- we don't wish to address these problems, Democrats should say, out of fairness or compassion or some desire to punish capitalists. We want to address them because putting more money in working- and middle-class people's pockets is a better way to spur on the economy than giving rich people more tax cuts.
That's an argument that might appeal broadly, but it's backed up by a theory that in our time is practically seditious: that the public sector can make better decisions about where money should go than the private sector. That is a principle Democrats have been skittish about supporting. But it is one they must start defending without apology.
They should defend it because it's what more and more economists argue and because it's what Democrats believe. There's a lot of ideological space between Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Representative Raúl Grijalva of Arizona, who is among the most left-leaning members of the House. But they're both Democrats for a reason, and presumably that reason is they think government can be a force for good in people's lives. So, if Democrats think it, they should say it.
And now we have arrived at an alternate theory, a story: Giving more money to working people and investing in their needs is how an economy grows. That's a direct counterargument to supply-side economics. If enough Democrats say it and say it and say it, they can drive a stake through supply-side's heart.
Once Democrats can make that case, they'll be able to turn the tables on the supply-siders. Republicans will argue that government investments and wage increases are "job killers." But Democrats, rather than merely appealing to people's consciences, will be able to respond that government investments and wage increases are growth producers that will spread benefits well beyond the top 5 percent or 10 percent.
The story could use a name. The venture capitalist Nick Hanauer and Eric Liu, a former Bill Clinton domestic policy adviser, coined "middle-out economics" five years ago. President Obama even used the phrase a few times.
The important thing is the idea. Democrats must persuade America that there's a better way to expand the economy than the way Republicans have been advocating for decades. Just as inflation and other ills opened the door for critiques of Keynesianism in the 1970s, so have inequality and disinvestment done the same for critiques of supply-side today. Someone just has to make them.

Full text: Stocks slipped on Friday as Apple shares absorbed their worst loss in more than four years. Thanks to gains over the previous three days, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index finished with its biggest weekly increase since March. Apple, the world's largest technology company, forecast weak revenue in the current quarter and startled investors by saying it would stop disclosing quarterly iPhone sales. That pulled technology stocks lower. Other high-growth stocks held up well after the United States and China said they had made some progress in trade talks, and Asian indexes surged on reports that China's government plans to cut taxes.
The Department of Labor said employers added 250,000 jobs in October, with no sign that hiring was going to slow down. The proportion of Americans with jobs is at its highest level since January 2009, and hourly wages also grew by the most since then. Along with high consumer confidence, those are all good signs for economic growth and consumer spending in the months to come.
Bond yields surged following the strong jobs report as investors bet on continued economic growth, which would push the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates more quickly.
"It clearly was a good report," said David Lefkowitz, senior equity strategist Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management.
Growth in wages was about what investors were expecting, Mr. Lefkowitz said. That is important because investors are still sensitive to signs that inflation could flare up, forcing the Federal Reserve to be more aggressive in raising rates. If inflation grows moderately, that would not be as likely.
The S.&P. 500 index slid 17.31 points, or 0.6 percent, to 2,723.06. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 109.91 points, or 0.4 percent, to 25,270.83.
The Nasdaq composite, which has a high concentration of technology companies, lost 77.06 points, or 1 percent, to 7,356.99.
Stocks had surged over the previous three days and finished the week 2.4 percent higher. They skidded in October, suffering their worst monthly loss in seven years. The S.&P. 500 will have to rise another 7.6 percent to match the record high it reached on Sept. 20.
Bond prices dropped, sending yields sharply higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note jumped to 3.22 percent, from 3.13 percent. A jump in interest rates last month started the market's downturn, but investors on Friday did not seem as worried. Interest rates will also be in focus when the Federal Reserve meets next week, though it is not expected to raise rates in November.
Apple stock sagged 6.6 percent to $207.48. Shares of chip-makers also fell. Qorvo stock lost 5.7 percent to $74 and Broadcom stock fell 4 percent to $220.77.
Starbucks's sales were better than expected, and customers spent more after it raised prices for brewed coffee. The stock jumped 9.7 percent to $64.42, its biggest gain since 2011. Kraft Heinz shares sank 9.7 percent to $50.73 after its third-quarter profit fell way short of analyst forecasts.
The governments of the United States and China both said they were making some progress in trade talks. It has been months since the two sides made any visible progress, and fears that the dispute was getting worse contributed to the big losses for global markets in October. Chinese state media also said President Xi Jingping promised tax cuts and other help to China's entrepreneurs.
In Germany, the DAX rose 0.4 percent and in France, the CAC 40 gained 0.3 percent. The FTSE 100 was down 0.3 percent in Britain.
The Nikkei 225 surged 2.6 percent in Japan, while in Hong Kong, the Hang Seng soared 4.2 percent. The Kospi was up 3.5 percent in South Korea.
The dollar rose to 113.16 yen from 112.70 yen. The euro slipped to $1.1394 from $1.1409.
Oil prices continued to slip. Benchmark United States crude fell 0.9 percent to $63.14 a barrel in New York and Brent crude shed 0.1 percent to $72.83 a barrel in London.
Gold fell 0.4 percent to $1,231.70 an ounce. Silver dipped 0.1 percent to $14.75 an ounce.

Employers in U.S. Add 250,000 Jobs As Economy Hums

Full text: The last official snapshot of the economy before Americans vote on Tuesday offered another reminder of the labor market's persistent strength. Hiring is up. Wages are up. The total number of workers and job searchers is up. "It's really the strongest part of the broader economy at the moment," Michelle Girard, chief United States economist at NatWest Markets, said of the labor market.
A swerving stock market, tariffs and weakening growth in other countries may be causing agita, but they have done little to dent economic momentum in the United States. Employers added 250,000 jobs in October, extending a record streak of growth to 97 months, the Labor Department reported on Friday.
The economy has historically not played an outsize role in midterm elections, and this political season, border control, health care and Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court have gobbled up airtime and political ad space. Still, about three-quarters of registered voters say the economy is "very important" in determining their vote, according to polls conducted by the Pew Research Center. Among Republicans, that number is even higher at 85 percent.
"Jobs and the economy" was also cited more frequently than other issues as the most important in a survey conducted in early October for The New York Times by the online research platform SurveyMonkey.
A recent string of reports suggests both are in good shape. Last week, the government estimated that the economy grew at a hearty annualized rate of 3.5 percent in the third quarter. Confidence remains high among consumers and business leaders. Over the past year, employers have added an average of 210,000 jobs a month.
Friday's roundup also offered evidence that sidelined workers are not only feeling optimistic about job prospects but are actually finding work, which is why the jobless rate was unchanged at 3.7 percent even as employers hired more people. An estimated 711,000 people joined the labor force last month. President Trump, on Friday, called the numbers "tremendous."
A modest monthly wage gain of 0.2 percent nonetheless produced a surprisingly big 3.1 percent jump in annual growth. That was partly because of an unusual drop in pay in October last year after hurricanes. Yet even if the year-over-year increase was somewhat inflated, the underlying trends point to a pickup in wage growth.
Some analysts saw warnings of inflation, but others said the pay increase should not bother policymakers at the Federal Reserve. "I don't think it's something the Fed should worry about," Ms. Girard said. "Productivity growth is picking up, and workers should earn more. It doesn't mean companies have to pass on higher wage costs to consumers. They can afford to pay them more."
The Fed, which has increased rates three times this year from historically low levels, is expected to raise them again to 2.5 percent in December as a hedge against inflation.
Mr. Trump has called the Fed "loco" and "out of control" for raising interest rates, and blamed it for the recent drop in stock prices and for potentially derailing the economy.
In a call with reporters, Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, cited productivity growth as the explanation for higher wages, and not an overheating economy. He also took the opportunity to say that the president respects the Fed's independence.
As always, the monthly jobs report captures only a particular moment; the underlying trend is what's important. That caution is particularly pertinent this time.
The back-to-back hurricanes in September and October may have distorted the data in unpredictable ways. "It looks good, but it's never happened before when you have hurricanes making landfall in successive survey weeks," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
Manufacturing jobs -- which have traditionally paid well and have been a focus of Mr. Trump's policies -- increased by a healthy 32,000.
Here, too, Mr. Shepherdson advised skepticism, noting that the Institute for Supply Management reported this week that its manufacturing index had fallen to a six-month low amid worries about tariffs, shortages of parts and a drop in global demand.
"If I were a Republican politician, I would be shouting about it," Mr. Shepherdson said, referring to manufacturing. "But there's no way that growth is going to continue." Manufacturing sectors in China, in particular, and Europe are weakening sharply. Producers, he said, are worried about "tariffs, tariffs, tariffs."
October's figures will be revised twice more, and September's once more.
Although the unemployment rate has consistently surfed below the levels reached in 2000, at the height of that expansion, wages have been growing at significantly slower rates.
Low wages in many sectors have contributed to financial instability. More than a quarter of Americans don't earn enough to cover basic expenses, while more than a third are unable to pay all their bills on time, according to a report released Thursday by the Center for Financial Services Innovation, which is funded by nonprofit foundations and several banks. That shortfall has contributed to mounting credit card debt and loan defaults.
October's report, however, is among several recent signs that wage growth is gathering steam.
According to a report last week from the research arm of the payroll processing firm ADP, American workers are earning nearly $1 more per hour on average than they were a year ago.
Protolabs, a digital manufacturing company based in Minnesota, hired 50 people last month, bringing the year's total to 340, a pace it expects to match in 2019, said Renee Conklin, vice president for human resources. But the competition for workers is becoming stiffer. "We're seeing more employers making counteroffers to retain people," Ms. Conklin said.
Since the recession ended, analysts have struggled to understand how many more potential workers are out there. Before the financial crisis, more than 66 percent of the population 16 or older was working or looking for a job. In recent years, that number -- the labor-force participation rate -- has rarely risen above 63 percent.
Many of those missing workers will never rejoin the labor force -- some have reached retirement age, others have seen their skills lose value, and a number are too disabled to work.
Economists continue to argue about how many more people could be lured back to the labor market. Rising wages are certainly one attraction.
Women are coming back into the work force at a much faster rate than men, however. And over the past year, a net total of 1.4 million women have joined compared with 845,000 men. Drawing in even more women would require better child care, paid parental leave and more flexible hours, said Betsey Stevenson, an economist at the University of Michigan. "We know what to do for women," she said. "We're really at a loss as to what to do to induce more men back."
Job opportunities are also rippling out to groups that were largely bypassed during much of the recovery: African-Americans, Hispanics, less-educated workers and people with disabilities have all seen their unemployment rates drop in recent months.
Employers say they are constantly on the hunt for workers. "I speak to probably a thousand businesspeople a month," said Rick Lazio, a former Republican congressman who is a senior vice president at Alliantgroup, a tax-credit consulting firm. Midsize manufacturers are turning down lots of business, he said, "because they can't find the people and they can't get the equipment fast enough."
Help is not coming from abroad: The number of immigrant visas issued by the government has declined for two years in a row.
Worries about fierce competition for holiday hiring have prompted employers to be more aggressive, putting offers out earlier than usual and raising wages, recruiters said.
United Parcel Service has said it plans to hire 100,000 seasonal workers. Several applicants for packing or delivery positions who showed up at the company's hulking customer center in Manhattan during a recent nationwide hiring drive said they hoped temporary stints would turn into permanent jobs. A company spokesman said holiday positions paid $10.35 to $30 an hour, depending on the location.
"I'm just praying," said Chanique Cox, 42, who did not finish high school. She knocked her knuckles on a wooden counter and clicked her blue nails. "I'm only finding temporary jobs. I would love it if I got a permanent job."

Full text: BEIJING -- As the United States and China swap threats and mete out increasingly punishing tariffs, the world is watching to see whether Beijing turns to one of its most potent economic weapons. It involves the number 7. China's currency, the renminbi, has been gradually losing value since mid-April, and on Tuesday it was at its weakest point in a decade. If the currency weakens any further, it could fall below the psychologically important level of 7 renminbi to the dollar. The last time it took more than 7 renminbi to buy a dollar was in May 2008, as the world was slipping into a financial crisis.
The Trump administration doesn't like the idea of a weaker Chinese currency. That could give what it considers an unfair advantage to China's exporters. In the arsenal of trade disputes, currencies can be potent weapons.
But China has good reason to keep its currency from weakening, and it appears to have acted in recent weeks to prop it up. Currencies may be potent weapons, but they are blunt ones -- and they can boomerang against those who use them.
What happens if the renminbi falls past 7 to the dollar?
There is nothing particularly threatening about the number 7 itself. The renminbi at 7.002 to the dollar is pretty similar to the currency at 6.998 to the dollar.
But passing that number would be significant symbolically. It would suggest China is prepared to let its currency weaken further still. That would give China's factory owners an advantage when they sell their goods in the United States. It would also undermine the tariffs the Trump administration has levied on more than $250 billion in Chinese-made products.
How would that help China?
Say you own a Chinese factory making lawn ornaments, and you sell a lot of pink flamingos to an American retailer. You price each at $1 -- they may sell for far more in the United States, but shipping and storage account for most of that. When the renminbi is 6 to the dollar, that translates to 6 renminbi in sales.
But when the currency depreciates to 7 to the dollar, that $1 flamingo is worth 7 renminbi in sales to you. Or you can cut the price -- say, from $1 to 85.7 cents -- and still make your original 6 renminbi in sales. Your American competitor, who has to buy and sell in dollars, has to grudgingly cut prices to compete.
(It's a lot more complicated in the real world. The plastic and metal for the plastic flamingo may have been imported to China and are priced in dollars. But bear with us.)
A weaker currency can also help Chinese exporters beat President Trump's tariffs. Right now, the United States imposes tariffs of about 10 percent on a wide variety of Chinese goods that arrive at an American port. If the renminbi has fallen 10 percent, the tariff is basically nullified.
What's driving the decline?
Some politicians in the United States and elsewhere have long said that China manipulates its currency, even though Washington officials -- including in the Trump administration -- have stopped short of official accusations. But in this case, many of the forces weakening the currency are beyond Beijing's immediate control.
China's financial system is firmly controlled by the government, giving the country's leaders a great degree of control over how much the renminbi is worth. Officials set a daily benchmark rate for the renminbi and allow its value to move a smidgen above or below that level in currency markets. Chinese officials say each day's trading activity helps determine the value they set for the renminbi the next day, but they disclose few details about how that works.
On Tuesday, Beijing set that guidepost at 6.9574, just a hair's breadth stronger than 7. In the world of foreign exchange, a higher number means a weaker currency.
Right now, traders are sending Beijing a single message: The renminbi should be worth less. The people and companies that hold the currency have become increasingly nervous about China's slowing economic growth, slumping stock market, fragile real estate market and seemingly intractable trade war with the United States. Inflation has begun to tick upward, and rising prices tend to make holding the relevant currency less attractive.
There are other reasons. Since late July, Beijing has tried to prop up the economy by having the state-controlled banking sector increase lending, making money more available. That means even more renminbi sloshing around, weakening the currency's value.
While China hasn't raised interest rates, the Federal Reserve in Washington has. That makes it attractive for many people to sell their renminbi and buy dollars. Would you rather have a one-year renminbi certificate of deposit that pays 1.5 percent interest now, or a one-year dollar C.D. that pays out 2.6 percent or more?
Is the drop deliberate on Beijing's part?
Not quite. If anything, Beijing is trying to keep the renminbi from falling too fast.
China has a number of ways to bolster the currency's value. One option is to follow the Fed's example and raise interest rates. That would give Chinese families and companies more incentive to keep their money in China. But that would raise the cost of borrowing in China, just as the economy is slowing.
Beijing could buy up its own currency instead. Like anything else, the renminbi's value rises when it is scarcer.
Thanks to the way it has managed its currency over the years, China has amassed the world's largest foreign exchange reserves -- a $3 trillion stash of money it keeps in dollars, euros, pounds, yen and other currencies. It has begun to tap that stash. When China's central bank released its monthly balance sheet a week ago, it showed a drop of almost $20 billion in foreign currency just during September.
"Selling almost $20 billion in a month won't break the bank," said Brad W. Setser, an economist at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. "But it does indicate the direction of current market pressure."
What are the broader risks?
Three years ago, as its economy slowed, China devalued the renminbi in part to give its factories a helping hand. The financial world was shocked. Markets plunged.
As Chinese officials hurried to explain themselves, people and companies began shifting their money -- money that China's economy needed -- outside the country. A year later, China had spent more than $500 billion from its reserves in an effort to shore up the renminbi. It later tightened controls on the financial system to shut off many ways people used to get money out of the country.
Should the trade war intensify, China may look to make more aggressive moves with its currency. But as history shows, there can be a price to pay.

Full text: Fear that the Trump administration will announce tariffs on all remaining imports from China helped knock stocks in the United States from a strong early gain to another sharp loss Monday. Technology companies sank again after Bloomberg News reported that the United States is planning new tariffs if the two sides do not make progress in trade talks next month.
Technology and internet companies, industrials and retailers took steep losses as Wall Street's recent bout of volatility continued. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has dropped 9.4 percent in October and is on track for its worst monthly loss since February 2009. That was right before the market hit its lowest point during the 2008-09 financial crisis.
Bloomberg News reported that the Trump administration will put tariffs on the rest of the country's imports from China if President Trump and Xi Jinping do not make substantial progress in easing the trade dispute next month.
The S.&P. 500 fell 17.44 points, or 0.7 percent, to 2,641.25. The Dow Jones industrial average gained as much as 352 points Monday morning but closed down 245.39 points, or 1 percent, to 24,442.92. It fell as much as 566 during the day.
The Nasdaq composite, which is heavily weighted with technology stocks, lost 116.92 points, or 1.6 percent, to 7,050.29.
Stocks have plunged since early October, breaking a long period of relative calm over the summer, and trading has been especially volatile the last few days.
Among industrials, Boeing sank 6.6 percent to $335.59. Some early gains for tech and internet stocks also faded. Microsoft shed 2.9 percent to $103.85. Alphabet, Google's parent company, lost 4.5 percent to $1,034.73.
Amazon.com dropped another 6.3 percent to $1,538.88. The online retailer tumbled Friday after it reported weak sales and gave a lower-than-expected revenue estimate for the quarter that includes the holiday shopping season. Its stock traded above $2,000 a share in early September and has fallen 24.5 percent since then.
The S.&P. 500 has fallen 9.9 percent from its latest record high on Sept. 20. The Nasdaq has plunged 13 percent from its record high reached Aug. 29.
For most of this year investors have remained hopeful that the United States and China would work out their disagreements on trade policy and that many of the tariffs would be reduced or eliminated. But in recent weeks they have lost some of their confidence, and that has contributed to the markets' tumble
The effects of higher tariffs could be especially severe for technology companies, which make many of their products in China, and for industrial companies, which are already paying higher prices for metals. The United States and China are the world's largest economies and their trade relationship is the world's largest, so the higher taxes on imports could also slow global economic growth and increase inflation.
While most technology companies fell, open-source software company Red Hat jumped after IBM agreed to buy it for $34 billion in stock. IBM's chairman and chief executive, Ginni Rometty, said the deal will make IBM the world's biggest hybrid cloud provider, meaning it will offer companies a mix of on-site, private and third-party public cloud services.
Red Hat soared 45.4 percent to $169.63, reversing its losses from earlier this year. IBM fell 4.1 percent to $119.64.
The prospect of reduced barriers to trade helped automakers on Monday. Car companies rose after Bloomberg News reported that regulators in China intend to propose cutting the tax on imported cars to 5 percent from 10 percent. The trade fight between the United States and China has hurt sales, and that slowdown is one of several factors that have damaged car company stocks this year.
Ford climbed 3.3 percent to $9.28 and auto parts retailer BorgWarner advanced 4 percent to $39.56. After Cooper Tire & Rubber reported a bigger third-quarter profit than analysts expected, its stock surged 21.4 percent to $30.89.
Bond prices dipped. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 3.09 percent from 3.08 percent.
The price of United States crude oil dropped 0.8 percent to $67.04 per barrel in New York.
Gold lost $8.00 to $1,224.50 an ounce.
The dollar rose to 112.35 yen from 111.85 yen. The euro fell to $1.1383 from $1.1407.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- In the House, the majority rules. Just ask Democrats, who have introduced bills destined for nowhere, watched oversight requests pile up and seen Republicans overrule most of their policy efforts. But if the Democrats take the House on Nov. 6, they will assume control of two of the most powerful tools in Washington: gavels and subpoenas.
The committee chairmen and women in waiting are mostly over 65 and considerably more diverse than the Republicans they would replace. They could become household names.
With chairmanships would come the power to compel the Trump administration to produce evidence, to call witnesses to the stand and to show voters -- ahead of 2020 -- how Democrats would run the government if given the chance.
Judiciary
Jerrold Nadler
New York
Lifelong New Yorkers, Mr. Nadler and President Trump have been at each other's throats since the 1990s, when Mr. Trump was a real estate developer and the Manhattan representative stood in the way of one of his West Side developments. Mr. Nadler's objections earned him a Trumpian jab -- "one of the most egregious hacks in contemporary politics" -- but as the chairman of one of the most powerful committees in Congress, Mr. Nadler could bring the president serious pain and potentially oversee his impeachment.
Mr. Nadler, 71, has pledged to start investigations into potential violations of anti-corruption clauses in the Constitution, Mr. Trump's apparent attempts to exert undue control over the F.B.I. and Justice Department, and accusations of sexual misconduct and perjury against Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh.
Mr. Nadler has said he would tread more carefully around the ongoing investigation of Mr. Trump's campaign and Russia. In the short term, that means protecting the special counsel overseeing the inquiry, Robert S. Mueller III. But when Mr. Mueller's work is complete, Mr. Nadler would be a key Democrat deciding whether to open an impeachment inquiry.
The committee also has jurisdiction over some of the Democrats' highest policy priorities, including writing laws on guns, immigration policy and voting rights.
Oversight and Government Reform
Elijah Cummings
Maryland
With his hands on the levers of the House's marquee investigative body, Mr. Cummings would face one of the Democrats' most perilous balancing acts: How to scrutinize the heap of Trump administration scandals left untouched by Republicans without appearing to overreach.
The son of sharecroppers, Mr. Cummings, 67, thinks he can pull it off. He is a blunt and fiery liberal beloved by his caucus who prizes strong working relationships with Republicans.
"This is not about trying to get any retribution. It is about trying to bring us back to a sense of integrity," he said.
Mr. Cummings has laid out two discreet lanes of inquiry: potential fraud and abuse by the White House and federal agencies; and broader issues that cut at what he refers to as "the soul of our democracy," such as voter suppression. With the second largest staff in the House, the committee could quickly initiate inquiries into issues like the hobbling of the Environmental Protection Agency, the White House's revocation of security clearances to voting rights, the 2020 census and implementation of the Affordable Care Act.
Financial Services
Maxine Waters
California
Perhaps no member of the House -- other than Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader -- has been a bigger target for Mr. Trump than Ms. Waters, the 80-year old firebrand from Los Angeles whom he routinely insults as stupid. Her incendiary language -- including calls for citizens to confront Trump administration officials in restaurants and other public places -- has made her a darling of the liberal left.
If Democrats take control, Ms. Waters can strike back. She has watched, unhappily, as Republicans have watered down the Dodd-Frank Act, the Obama-era legislation aimed at reining in risky banking practices and protecting consumers. At the helm of the Financial Services Committee, Ms. Waters would almost certainly move to undo the Republicans' changes and put teeth back into the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, though such efforts would have trouble passing a Republican Senate.
"Financial services issues are critical for all Americans and for our economy," she said in an emailed statement, "and I am focused on making sure that our financial system is fair."
Appropriations
Nita Lowey
New York
Women have been a driving force behind the Democrats' push to retake the House. If they are successful, Ms. Lowey would be the first chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee, the powerful panel that controls discretionary spending.
Look for Ms. Lowey, 81, to use the power of the purse to advance spending legislation that reflects the Democrats' policy goals, including expanding access to health care, lowering prescription drug prices, and increasing funding for child care and early education programs.
She led a successful push earlier this year to fund gun violence prevention studies at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; the agency had avoided such research for 20 years, fearing political repercussions. She said she intended to make certain such studies get underway. Separately, she will press for expanded funding for birth control and work to block Republican efforts to reduce spending on family planning or eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood.
"In my work as a woman appropriator," Ms. Lowey said, "I want to make sure that we're protecting women's health, women's rights."
Armed Services
Adam Smith
Washington State
Like other would-be chairman, Mr. Smith, a hawkish former prosecutor, wants badly to step up the committee's oversight role. He said last month at a defense conference that he would scrutinize overseas military operations, calling out the conflict in Yemen as antithetical to American values. The committee would also look to curtail the president's efforts to expand the nuclear arsenal, Mr. Smith said, and to protect lesbian, gay and transgender people serving in the armed forces.
At 53, he is one of the younger potential chairmen, though he has served in the House for more than 20 years.
Education and the Workforce
Bobby Scott
Virginia
A soft-spoken but forceful presence on Capitol Hill, Mr. Scott, 71, is the first African-American elected to Congress from Virginia since Reconstruction and a Harvard-educated former civil rights lawyer. He has been a sharp critic of Betsy DeVos, the education secretary.
High on Mr. Scott's list is addressing inequities in education. He has repeatedly called on the department to work harder to close the achievement gap between white students and minorities -- and has accused Ms. DeVos of permitting states to flout a law that requires schools to make progress toward that goal.
It will also be up to Mr. Scott to try to make good on the Democrats' promise to make college education affordable. He and his fellow Democrats have already introduced legislation, the Aim Higher Act, to expand access to federal student loans, provide states with grants that would help students graduate from community college debt-free, and crack down on predatory for-profit colleges.
Energy and Commerce
Frank Pallone
New Jersey
With jurisdiction over health care, energy, the environment and interstate business, the Energy and Commerce Committee looks over some of the most important planks of any party's agenda. For the Democrats and Mr. Pallone, 66, stabilizing the Affordable Care Act, lowering prescription drug costs and restoring environmental rules undone by Mr. Trump would top the list.
If Republicans still control the Senate, major Democratic priorities, like legislation addressing climate change, are probably headed nowhere. But Mr. Pallone, a member of the Progressive Caucus, could certainly raise the profile of his party's solutions and could use the committee for hearings into malfeasance in the private sector.
Mr. Pallone may try to work with Republicans to craft new regulations on how social media companies collect and use user data. He would also use the committee to apply pressure on the Federal Communications Commission and its decision to eliminate net neutrality rules.
Foreign Affairs
Eliot L. Engel
New York
The soft-spoken Mr. Engel, 71, hopes to be a counterbalance to Mr. Trump's unconventional foreign policy, and he could get an opportunity sooner than anticipated. After the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, the Trump administration is under intense pressure to punish one of the United States' closest Arab allies, and the president has said he would rather Congress take the lead. That could give a starring role to Mr. Engel, a lifelong resident of the Bronx whose unflagging support for Israel has occasionally put him at odds with his party.
Mr. Engel could also revive legislation he wrote to hold Russian actors responsible for interfering in the 2016 election and a resolution of inquiry seeking records from Mr. Trump's summit meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia earlier this year in Helsinki, Finland. And Democrats are eager to question the State Department on the potential targeting of career employees based on their politics.
Intelligence
Adam B. Schiff
California
The committee's divisive investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 election made its Democratic members some of the best-known names in Washington -- none more so than Mr. Schiff. But the meticulous former federal prosecutor from greater Los Angeles sees its work on the issue as far from done.
When Republicans concluded the Russia investigation in March having found no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, Mr. Schiff, 58, and committee Democrats put together a 98-page document detailing outstanding lines of inquiry. With subpoena power, he could chip away at those leads, compelling new testimony from witnesses that Republicans left unexplored.
"One of the issues that is of great concern to me is: Were the Russians laundering money through the Trump Organization," Mr. Schiff said in a recent interview. "That to me would be far more powerful kompromat than any video."
Mr. Schiff has said he will make restoring "comity" on the committee a priority after two years of intense partisan infighting.
Transportation and Infrastructure
Peter DeFazio
Oregon
Considered one of the last opportunities for bipartisanship action, infrastructure could be one of the first action items on the Democrats' to-do list, and the president may find an unlikely ally in Mr. DeFazio. The 71-year-old chairman-in-waiting has signaled his willingness to work with Mr. Trump, and the president himself has publicly mused that there's "a chance" House Democrats and he will "get along and get along well."
Democrats' proposed infrastructure plan is a sprawling $1 trillion package that would rebuild roads, bridges, water pipes and rural areas' broadband networks. Mr. DeFazio has proposed generating more revenue by raising the gas tax and indexing it to inflation.
Ways and Means
Richard E. Neal
Massachusetts
The powerful Ways and Means Committee writes tax law, signs off on trade deals, and oversees Social Security and Medicare. Mr. Neal, an institutionally minded western Massachusetts Democrat, wants to make serious policy pushes in almost all of those areas.
First Mr. Neal, 69, would lead the committee's consideration of the revised North American Free Trade Agreement. Mr. Neal voted against the original Nafta agreement, and his opposition to the deal could hobble efforts to sign it into law quickly. Mr. Neal was a vocal opponent of Republicans' latest tax cuts and would convene hearings on the law's effects. He and committee Democrats also would play a key role in the party's attempts to stabilize the Affordable Care Act, address high prescription drug costs, negotiate a potential infrastructure investment bill with Mr. Trump and pass legislation requiring all but the smallest employers to provide 401(k) retirement plans.
Mr. Neal also would have at his disposal an obscure provision in the federal tax code that allows the leaders of Congress's tax-writing committees to request and investigate the tax returns of any American, including the president.

Full text: The American economy barreled ahead in the third quarter as consumers stepped up and spent more, keeping it on track for the best annual performance since 2005. The government said on Friday that the economy expanded at an annualized rate of 3.5 percent between July and September after the 4.2 percent pace in the previous quarter. But there were signs that the growth could cool in the coming months.
Businesses remain hesitant to increase spending, despite the large corporate tax cut enacted late last year. Some of the gains were also one-offs that could fade quickly, like the restocking of shelves at stores and warehouses, which contributed more than half of the overall growth.
If there is a slowdown in the economy, it could further unsettle the markets, which have slumped in recent weeks. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 1.7 percent on Friday and is down nearly 9 percent for the month.
"Clearly a strong headline, but the details are a little less robust," said Michelle Meyer, who leads United States economics at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Still, with 10 days to go before the midterm election, the headline number will be a valuable talking point for Republicans on the campaign trail. The second and third quarters represented the strongest back-to-back growth since 2014, and Republican leaders were quick to claim credit.
"Americans have more opportunity and more money in their pockets today than they did two years ago, and that's in large part due to the reforms we've pushed forward," said Representative Erik Paulsen, a Minnesota Republican who is chairman of the Joint Economic Committee and is in a tight race for re-election, according to recent polls.
Tax cuts for individuals and the budget deal early this year, which raised federal spending, helped elevate growth in the third quarter. Consumer spending increased 4 percent, and federal outlays rose 3.3 percent.
"There will come a day of reckoning for the economy after the money from the tax cuts is all gone," said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank, "but for today Washington really has something to crow about."
The effect of the corporate tax cut was less evident. Businesses did not ramp up investment in equipment and factories -- the kinds of things executives do when they anticipate the good times to continue.
"You really lean back in your chair and wonder whether this enormous tax cut that was given to corporations only lasted three months," said Torsten Slok, chief international economist at Deutsche Bank. "The economics textbook would say that if you give a tax cut that lasts several years, you should see the effects for several years."
Looking ahead, Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays, said that he was not expecting a big rebound in business spending and that "if you're banking on strong G.D.P. growth, you need business investment."
Another wild card is the effect from one of President Trump's signature economic moves: increasing tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese imports. The president has also raised tariffs on imports from around the world, including on steel, aluminum and solar panels. So far, there is little evidence that those trade policies have hurt growth much.
A surge in soybean purchases by buyers seeking to act before retaliatory Chinese tariffs kicked in helped lift gross domestic product in the second quarter. But that uptick reversed itself in the third quarter.
"One interpretation of the data is that the trade war is not having the intended effect of boosting exports and lowering imports," Mr. Slok said. "Another interpretation is that the trade war can't do much about that. If the consumer spends more, you will have more imports."
Trip Tollison, chief executive of the Savannah Economic Development Authority in Georgia, said that shipping volume at the Port of Savannah was up 12 percent from a year ago and that there were almost no vacancies in the industrial real estate market. Warehouses and logistics companies have been among the most active businesses in the area.
"We're in a great spot, no complaints for sure," Mr. Tollison said. "We've got a very strong economy right now."
The latest data could increase the likelihood that policymakers at the Federal Reserve will continue to gradually raise interest rates, in order to prevent the economy from overheating and to head off inflation. The Fed is expected to raise rates one more time this year, in December, and several times in 2019.
That has irked Mr. Trump, who criticized the chairman of the Fed, Jerome H. Powell, on Tuesday. "Every time we do something great, he raises the interest rates," the president said.
Officials at the Fed, who do not report to the president, consider themselves above politics. Mr. Trump's attack is highly unusual.
The steady increase in borrowing costs is already being felt in the housing market. Residential investment slid 4 percent in the third quarter, and has fallen in five of the last six quarters.
Rising interest rates also put downward pressure on stocks. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note has been climbing, which makes riskier stocks less appealing to investors than safer bonds.
"We can only think investors are already looking ahead to economic conditions next year when the fiscal stimulus boost starts to fade," Mr. Rupkey of MUFG Union Bank said. "For the stock market, the economy's as good as it gets, and after buying the rumors, they are selling the fact."
Wall Street's recent decline, which began in early October, came too late to affect sentiment or spending in the third quarter. But on Main Street, consumers do have plenty to cheer. Unemployment in September stood at 3.7 percent, the lowest in nearly half a century, and wages are finally rising.
In Chicago, Avant, an online consumer lender with 600 employees, is planning to hire 400 more people by the end of 2019. The company specializes in lending to families earning between $40,000 and $100,000 for things like debt consolidation, auto repairs and medical bills. It also sells online lending technology to banks.
"Consumers today are in great shape," said Al Goldstein, Avant's chief executive. Injecting a note of caution, he added that "if interest rates continue to rise, that may change."

Full text: STANFORD, Calif. -- I'm a 65-year-old member of the Me Generation. I'm writing to people my age and older about the iGeneration -- those under 25, often called Generation Z. Many of them worry about their futures and could use help. If we're to avoid living down to our self-centered nickname, our post-65 narrative must change. A half-century ago, many of us grew up expecting to work hard and quit at 65, or sooner. With decent pensions and government benefits, we would live on the golf course or the beach for 10, maybe 20 years.
Many of us are retiring before 65 or not returning to work after our children leave. But now many of us will live into our late 80s and 90s. Since we were as young as the iGen is now, average life expectancy in America has risen more than five years, and higher for the most affluent. One reason is Medicare, covering Americans over 65 or disabled.
Now that doctors keep us alive longer, we're costing far more than our parents and grandparents did. Annual health spending -- $2,200 per American in 1970 when we were their age -- almost quintupled to more than $10,000 in 2016, after inflation, according to the National Health Expenditure Accounts.
What should bother the iGen is that 50 years ago this money might have gone to improving schools or roads or safety, or to fighting climate change.
I even wonder whether increased Medicare spending is partly responsible for the election of Donald Trump, whose margin of victory came from voters in our generation. Without that spending, might enough of us have died sooner and tipped the balance in favor of Hillary Clinton?
My generation will say we paid into the system for decades and deserve our entitlements. But the one-earner baby boomer couple my age who have earned the average wage every year have paid less than $100,000 in Medicare taxes but are taking out benefits worth more than $400,000, after adjusting for inflation, according to C. Eugene Steuerle, a former Treasury official now at the Urban Institute.
He also found that the couple will receive half a million dollars in Social Security after paying in little more than a quarter million.
And when generations are compared, a declining number of young people are available to support a rising tide of retiring baby boomers, even as employers cut benefits, particularly for younger workers.
What should we older folks do?
First, those who remain healthy must stay productive -- preferably in ways that help young people. In my case, I created a teaching job that pays me health insurance, so that even as I still contribute to Medicare, I don't draw benefits.
Some of us can't work full time. But we -- especially the comfortable, like many my age here in Silicon Valley -- could volunteer in programs that benefit children. One woman I know began coaching students, many from immigrant families, on their writing. A college classmate is overseeing and financing the San Francisco high school that educated him and that now teaches low-income students. Another classmate is reviving an athletic competition for Los Angeles children.
Second, those of us with savings can donate to causes that benefit the young, including through our wills. Baby boomers sit on many trillions in assets. By diverting some to such causes, we could have a big effect. Two of my former business students have created a company, Freewill, that encourages us to create wills and leave money to worthy causes. A 69-year-old retired businessman in Houston left 20 percent of his $2 million estate to the Boys & Girls Clubs of America. By contrast, many baby boomers, even affluent ones, have no will, and only about 5 percent leave money to charity, Freewill reports.
Two other students are creating a business that matches volunteers with people who pay for services with a contribution to charity. We could volunteer, or we could hire those volunteers. Yet another former student has created a kind of Common App for scholarships, making it far easier for youths to apply and much simpler for donors to create them.
Third, we can create a living will and make clear we don't want expensive medical care when it won't make a difference.
At Stanford's commencement last June, the actor Sterling K. Brown, halfway between our generations, laid out for the iGen a mission that should be the Me Gen's too. "My mama always told me, 'When you visit someone else's house, leave things better than the way you found them,"' he said. "'That way, you'll always be asked back."'
The singer Sheena Easton might describe our mission another way: less takin' and more givin'.
Talking with hundreds of students has brought home how worried our children and grandchildren are about climate change, inequality and the shrinking role of government in helping needy people.
I tell them about the political system in which we in the Me Generation grew up. In the mid-1960s, Republicans and Democrats of my parents' and grandparents' generations created Medicare, Medicaid, the Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act, immigration reform, education reform, the Highway Safety Act, the Wilderness Act, cleaner air and water, public broadcasting and much more.
Our generation has failed at anything close to that. But such magic is possible. Remind your children and grandchildren of that. Tell them it starts with voting, for candidates who will represent their interests. Urge them to make it happen. And help them.

Don't Panic. Market Drop Likely a Reset.

Full text: The stock market drop in October has been unsettling for anyone with a portfolio, particularly after a 3 percent plunge Wednesday that wiped out the year's gains. Could this be the beginning of a larger crash, or a recession? Well sure, it could. But even before accounting for the moderate rebound in markets Thursday morning, it makes more sense to view this sell-off differently. This isn't a crash, it's a reset. The economy is shifting in ways that aren't bullish for stock prices in the years ahead, but signal mostly good news for the economy and for ordinary people trying to make a living.
The bull market that will turn 10 years old early next year has, for most of its run, been a total dream for stock investors.
Economic growth in the United States has been steady, but growth worldwide has been slow -- which has kept interest rates low, making stocks a more compelling investment than cash or bonds in comparison.
Weak growth and high unemployment meant companies faced little pressure to pay more for their inputs, including both labor and raw materials. If a worker demanded a raise or a supplier threatened a price increase, there were plenty of alternatives.
Late in this bull market, the Trump administration made its signature domestic policy initiative a steep cut in corporate tax rates, which flows through directly into higher after-tax profits for shareholders.
Those three factors together were enough to propel the Standard & Poor's 500 up more than 300 percent from its March 2009 low to its recent high in September. But now, all three are shifting.
The economy is now heating up enough that interest rates are rising to more normal levels. Part of that is a result of Federal Reserve rate increases aimed at preventing the economy from overheating and from having excess inflation break out, a policy that President Trump has attacked.
But it's not just the Fed. Even longer-term interest rates that the Fed does not directly control have risen substantially in the last year, as have longer-term rates in other countries. British, German and Japanese bond yields are all up over the same span.
If you look at the stock market only in terms of its valuation -- how much you have to spend to buy shares for each dollar of corporate earnings you are capturing -- the stock market drop in recent weeks can be explained in significant part by the rise in longer-term rates in the same period.
If you look at the price-earnings ratio of the S.&P. 500 stocks, for example, and invert it to view it as the earnings-to-price ratio, it was 4.77 percent on Sept 1, meaning buying $100 bought you $4.77 worth of corporate profits. After the stock drop, that had risen to 5.23 percent.
The jump closely parallels the rise in longer-term bond yields, which, again, are mostly driven by an improving growth outlook. The yield on 10-year Treasury bonds has risen to 3.13 percent from 2.85 percent in that same span.
Higher interest rates have made bonds more attractive, and it makes perfect sense that investors would demand a more favorable valuation from stocks given that alternative.
The story might be different if investors believed that higher growth would feed disproportionately into higher corporate profits. But the current economic moment offers plenty of reason to think it won't.
Earlier in the expansion, there might have been lots of workers on the sidelines, and companies had leverage with their suppliers. But there are signs that is changing, like recent comments by 3M and Caterpillar that their input costs were rising, which helped kick off the recent bout of market weakness.
This is bad news for stocks and for the bottom lines of the largest companies, but good news for American workers. When you hear a phrase on a corporate call like "input costs are rising," keep in mind that the wages you receive are one of those costs.
Finally, while the first big economic initiative of the Trump administration, the tax cuts, was an unquestionable boon for stocks, the focus this year has been on a trade war, especially with China.
So far, the scale of the tariffs hasn't been big enough to have much impact on overall economic growth. But there has been a direct bottom-line impact for particular blue-chip companies that make goods using steel or aluminum (prices of which have spiked because of tariffs) or that import key parts from China.
As companies try to reroute supply chains or absorb higher costs to avoid raising prices on consumers, the trade war may have a much larger effect on the bottom lines of major industrial companies, and hence on their stock prices, than it does for ordinary consumers.
Put it together, and the stock market tumble of the last few weeks is not a mystery to be solved, nor a warning of horrible things to come, so much as an inevitable result of the economic expansion reaching a more mature stage.
The stock market looks forward, not back -- share prices are determined by what investors think the future looks like. And the economic future is starting to look quite different from the past.

Worries Add Up As Stocks Plunge

Full text: Another wave of selling hit the nearly decade-long bull market as investors worried that the ideal climate they have long enjoyed -- a surging economy, low interest rates and fast-growing corporate profits -- would soon be behind them. The benchmark Standard & Poor's 500-stock index shed 3 percent on Wednesday, wiping out its gains for the year. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index was down 4.4 percent, and has fallen more than 12 percent since early September.
Markets in Japan, China and Hong Kong matched Wall Street's drop on Thursday morning trading. It one potentially positive sign, futures markets that track the performance of stocks in the United States rose, suggesting investor attitudes might brighten when Wall Street opens.
Just over a month ago, the S.&P. 500 was up nearly 10 percent for 2018, with expectations that coming quarterly corporate earnings reports -- juiced by a generous tax cut and strong economic growth -- would keep sending stock prices upward.
It hasn't worked out that way.
Instead of celebrating quarterly profit and sales numbers that have largely lived up to expectations, investors have zeroed in on potential risks to the economic and corporate profit outlook for the coming year. Rising commodity costs tied to tariffs on imports, expectations that the Federal Reserve will keep raising interest rates, and an economic slowdown in China could all start to bite. And that's on top of investors' anxiety about what the midterm elections could mean for their portfolios.
"It was kind of a market that was looking for a reason to have some money come out of it," said Tony Dwyer, chief market strategist with the brokerage firm Canaccord Genuity in New York. "And it found it."
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 608 points, or 2.4 percent, on Wednesday. And the Nasdaq has now fallen into correction territory -- a decline of more than 10 percent from an earlier peak, which indicates a drop that's more serious than a garden-variety slump. The S.&P. 500 is down to 2,656.10, more than 9 percent off its recent peak on Sept. 20, meaning it, too, is nearing a correction.
The sell-off has come as political discord has jumped with Election Day less than two weeks away. On Wednesday, the discovery of explosive packages sent to prominent Democrats, including former President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state, as well as CNN, added to an already tense environment.
Some market observers think that investors may be moving to the sidelines before what could be a very close and bitter election.
"I think people just want to clear the decks and get the heck out before the midterm elections, frankly," said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank.
President Trump has repeatedly cited the strong performance of the stock market as evidence of the success of his administration's business-friendly approach. And as the market has slid lately, he has ratcheted up his criticism of the Federal Reserve's plan to raise interest rates as economic growth remains strong.
Low interest rates have helped support economic growth and the stock market since the financial crisis 10 years ago. But with unemployment at a 49-year-low, the Fed is now raising interest rates, saying it wants to keep the economy from overheating, which could set off inflation. The Fed is expected to raise interest rates again at its next meeting in December.
The rise in interest rates has been particularly painful for some pockets of the markets. Shares of homebuilders are down more than 16 percent this month, as rising mortgage rates have made houses less affordable. Smaller companies -- which are heavily exposed to floating-rate debt -- have also been hurt by rising rates, which increases the cost of their debt payments. The Russell 2000 index of small-capitalization stocks has fallen more than 13 percent in October.
And the president's trade war with China has increasingly preoccupied the markets, analysts said. Official numbers released by Beijing last week showed China's economic growth has slowed to 6.5 percent, its lowest level since 2009.
The slowdown in China, the world's second-largest economy, could mean falling sales for American companies that export to that market. As large consumers of metal who have invested heavily to gain access to the Chinese auto market -- the world's largest -- carmakers are particularly vulnerable to such risks. On Wednesday, Ford cited weak sales in China for falling profits. Company officials said issues surrounding trade disputes -- including tariffs on imported steel and aluminum -- could cost Ford $1 billion this year.
"What is really happening here is that people are saying, 'We just don't know about trade. We don't know how that's going to hit the margins or the earnings streams next year,"' said Michael Purves, chief global strategist at the brokerage firm Weeden & Company.
Mr. Purves said investors were eager for a resolution to the trade dispute and nervous that it could escalate further.
"I think there is a game of chicken going on between Trump and the markets right now," he added.
On Wednesday, the market tumble snowballed over the course of the day. Technology companies that have driven big market gains were badly battered. Shares in the tech heavyweights Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook all fell more than 5 percent. Netflix fell more than 9 percent after a media report that Apple planned to announce a subscription television service that would go head-to-head with its streaming service.
The news wasn't all bad for tech. Later Wednesday, Microsoft reported results that exceeded analyst expectations, sending its shares higher in after-hours trading. And Tesla shares also rose in after-hours trading after the electric-car maker reported its first profit in two years.
More high-profile results from tech companies are due in the coming days. Google's parent company, Alphabet; Amazon; and Twitter are scheduled to report results on Thursday. And Facebook's earnings report on Tuesday will be of intense interest: The company's report last quarter sent its stock price diving, erasing more than $100 billion in shareholder wealth.

Full text: Half a century ago, a typical Sears salesman could walk out of the store at retirement with a nest egg worth well over a million in today's dollars, feathered with company stock. A warehouse worker hired now at Amazon who stays until retirement would leave with a fraction of that.
Much as Sears has declined in the intervening decades, so has the willingness of corporate America to share the rewards of success. Shareholders now come first and employees have been pushed to the back of the line.
This shift is broader than a single company's culture, reflecting deep changes in how business is now conducted in America. Winner-take-some has evolved into winner-take-most or -all, and in many cases publicly traded companies are concentrating wealth, not spreading it. Profit-sharing and pensions are a rarity among the rank-and-file, while top executives take home an increasing share of the spoils.
Amazon shareholders have benefited more than workers, but Sears, in its heyday, tried to serve both.
The company earmarked 10 percent of pretax earnings for a retirement plan for full-time employees and by the 1950s, the workers owned a quarter of Sears. By contrast, one man at Amazon, the founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos, owns 16 percent of the company and is ranked as the world's richest person.
Amazon, which changed how Americans shop much as Sears did in its prime, does not disclose what percentage of its stock is owned by employees.
But this month, Amazon stopped giving stock to hundreds of thousands of employees, even as it lifted its minimum hourly wage to $15. While the raise garnered headlines, the move to curb stock awards may ultimately be more significant.
Not only does it reverse what had been an unusually broad employee stock ownership program, Amazon's decision underscores how lower-paid employees across corporate America have been locked out of profit-sharing and stock grants.
"What's happened is that shareholders' interests have squeezed out other stakeholders," said Arthur C. Martinez, who ran Sears during the 1990s and was credited with a turnaround. "The mantra is shareholders above all else."
Decades ago, he said, "the people who produced or sold the product were more central than the people in the corporate suite. There was a different mind-set and it's linked to the larger issue of income inequality."
Not only was Sears's program generous, it was also remarkably egalitarian. Contributions were based on years of service, not rank, and the longest-serving workers received nearly $3 for every dollar they contributed. The company phased out the profit-sharing plan beginning in the 1970s. This month, after years of lackluster attempts at revival, the retailer filed for bankruptcy protection.
Sears was hardly alone in corporate America, said Prof. Joseph R. Blasi, who directs Rutgers's Institute for the Study of Employee Ownership and Profit Sharing.
Companies like Procter & Gamble, S.C. Johnson, Hallmark Cards and U.S. Steel all embraced profit-sharing and were part of a corporate movement to encourage the practice, he said.
Among some leading executives in the early to mid-20th century, Professor Blasi said, "there was a notion that wages were not enough and workers had a right to share in the fruits of their labor."
In the executive suite, however, profit-sharing still flourishes. While 68 percent of workers who earn more than $75,000 benefit from it, only 20 percent of workers earning less than $30,000 do, according to Professor Blasi. The decline of profit-sharing for the latter group has accelerated in recent years, with the median annual grant falling to $300 in 2014 from $921 in 2002.
There are Amazon employees who hold a lot of stock. Four out of the top five executives earned less than $175,000 each in annual salary in the last three years, but got tens of millions of dollars in stock.
By present-day standards, Amazon is relatively generous. In addition to 401(k)'s, full-time employees receive medical insurance and a week of paid vacation their first year.
Fifty years ago, Sears provided all of that plus a much larger annual retirement contribution. While the typical Amazon employee receives $680 from the company in a 401(k), the average Sears worker got the present-day equivalent of $2,744. Dividends on accumulated stock could add thousands annually.
The Sears approach was not without flaws. By putting much of its assets into company stock, it made workers even more exposed to their employer's fate. It also favored men over women, who lost out when they took time off or left earlier than male colleagues, according to Sanford Jacoby, a professor of management and public policy at University of California, Los Angeles.
Still, it was very popular with employees. "People were retiring with nice chunks of change," Professor Jacoby said. "People loved this fund and Sears was a wildly successful company."
If Amazon's 575,000 total employees owned the same proportion of their employer's stock as the Sears workers did in the 1950s, they would each own shares worth $381,000.
Until this month, Amazon had been awarding two shares a year to warehouse employees, worth about $3,500 at the current price. The loss of those grants will prevent employees from directly partaking in one of the greatest examples of wealth creation.
To make up for the lost stock grants, Amazon has provided raises of at least $1.25 an hour to employees who had been earning over $15, plus cash bonuses at five, 10, 15 and 20 years of employment. Employees can put 401(k) contributions into Amazon shares.
Several employees interviewed, who insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, expressed disappointment. Amazon should have saved the dollar and kept giving workers stock, said one warehouse employee in Baltimore.
Amazon insisted workers were not losing out. "The significant increase in hourly cash wages effective Nov. 1 more than compensates for the phaseout of incentive pay and future stock grants," said a company spokeswoman, Ashley Robinson.
But that approach could make workers feel less connected to Amazon's success, said Jeffrey D. Shulman, a professor of marketing at the University of Washington. "Going forward, it almost becomes a zero-sum game," he said. "Now when the company makes a decision, Amazon either puts money into the pockets of shareholders or employees."
The calculus was different at Sears, said Dan Fapp, a former communications executive who worked there from 1963 to 1999. "If the company did well and the stock went up, your account was worth more," he said.
"It was not unusual for people to have $250,000 to $350,000 when they retired in the 1960s and early 1970s," Mr. Fapp said. That's worth well over $1 million today after adjusting for inflation.
At stores, there were also opportunities for salespeople to increase their base salary through commissions. So-called Big Ticket Men, who sold more expensive goods, earned the equivalent of nearly $50,000 a year.
Stanley Hreneczko, 91, started working at the Sears in Troy, Mich., in 1965. He was a salesman in the appliances department -- selling stoves and refrigerators. Thanks to his generous pay and the corporate savings plan, Mr. Hreneczko bought a home in cash and took summer vacations to Arizona and Florida.
"It was like working in heaven," he said.
Even junior employees were well taken care of.
"Most of these people retired with a good pension," said Jon White, who worked at Sears for 38 years, most recently as a manager in a store in Lithonia, Ga., before retiring in 2008. "Most of them are comfortable for the most part -- cashiers, clerks, replenishers, all kinds of workers."
Even after Sears scaled back its profit-sharing plan, workers benefited from a pension plan that held a diverse portfolio of stocks and bonds and provided fixed payments based on their salaries and tenure at the company. With Sears in bankruptcy, the federal government is expected to guarantee some or most of those pension payments.
Unlike Sears, Amazon is growing rapidly and the company says it is working harder to increase opportunities for promotion from the warehouse floor into leadership positions.
But its warehouses are staffed primarily by legions of lower-paid hourly employees. Of more than 2,000 workers at its fulfillment center in Carteret, N.J., all but 230 earn less than $17 an hour, or about $35,000 a year. During a recent tour there, one worker, Julia Teran, said she had received six shares during her three years at the company.
"I keep it for my retirement," Ms. Teran, 58, said of her stock, which is worth more than $10,000. How does she feel about the end of stock grants? "Things change," she said with a half-smile.

What Is Turkey's Game?

Full text: Turkey has furthered the cause of justice by refusing to let Saudi Arabia evade responsibility for the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, the Washington Post columnist.
The steady drip of reports from President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government-controlled news media over the past three weeks, exposing grisly details of the killing, has drawn the world's attention to the ruthlessness of the kingdom's young crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, even as the Trump administration gave every sign of longing to look away.
On Tuesday, Mr. Erdogan again drew the world's eyes to this atrocity by addressing the issue at length for the first time, in a speech to members of his party.
He described the killing as "premeditated murder" and laid out a chronology of what happened. He also demanded that the Saudis provide more details -- many questions remain unanswered -- and extradite the 18 suspects they detained to face justice in Turkey. And he suggested that Prince Mohammed or someone close to him had directed the assault, which took place at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul.
"On whose orders did those individuals go there?" Mr. Erdogan demanded.
Such an open challenge to Saudi Arabia, a regional power that has cultivated a close relationship with President Trump and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, is an audacious move. What does Mr. Erdogan hope to achieve?
It's unlikely that he is much moved by the killing of a journalist, given Mr. Erdogan's record for abusing journalists and restricting press freedoms. Last year, media freedom groups once again judged Turkey to be the world's worst offender for jailing reporters for their work.
If not press freedom, then what principles is Mr. Erdogan defending?
No doubt Mr. Erdogan is outraged that a foreign power committed such a brazen killing within Turkey's borders -- indeed, in Istanbul, the president's hometown. Saudi Arabia flew in a 15-man hit squad to carry out the crime, and Mr. Khashoggi's body is still missing.
And perhaps Mr. Erdogan sees an opportunity, as American officials and other experts have speculated, to use the murder to extort money from the Saudis to shore up Turkey's failing economy in exchange for eventually helping to shift the blame away from the Saudi regime. The Turkish lira has been falling steadily and inflation has been rising, squeezing Turkish workers and the government.
Though one hasn't materialized, some sort of Saudi-Turkish compromise to keep further details of the crime a secret remains a possibility, even though the full truth and accountability for the killers are what's needed. Gina Haspel, the C.I.A. director, was in Istanbul on Tuesday to be briefed on the case.
With Tuesday's speech, Mr. Erdogan has staked his personal reputation on the claim that the Saudi story -- that the killing was a result of a "rogue operation" or an impromptu brawl -- is a lie. (By day's end, even President Trump agreed the account was the "worst cover-up ever.")
Crucially, though, Mr. Erdogan didn't go nearly as far as he'd hinted he might. He pointed the finger at Prince Mohammed only indirectly, and he spoke respectfully of King Salman, the prince's father and the kingdom's ultimate ruler, a sign that he still hoped to avoid a complete break with Riyadh.
That could leave room for Turkey and Saudi Arabia to engineer a deal. "He's just bargaining and increasing the price," one diplomat said of Mr. Erdogan.
If Mr. Erdogan claims to possess the kind of evidence that has been reported -- an audio of the killing or other intelligence -- he could have the power to derail Prince Mohammed, Saudi Arabia's 33-year-old heir apparent. Even though the prince received a standing ovation at an economic conference on Riyadh on Tuesday, he is fast becoming a pariah and subject of palace intrigue.
In fact, that may be Mr. Erdogan's real objective. He almost certainly views the Khashoggi episode as a chance to kneecap a regional rival and advance his goal of making Turkey the dominant Sunni Muslim power. He harbors dreams of presiding over a renewed Ottoman Empire. While that might be feasible in terms of political influence, it's doubtful he could extend Turkey's territory to any significant degree, though he has moved troops into northern Syria to fight what he views as Kurdish separatists who endanger Turkey's borders.
Mr. Erdogan has supported groups like the Muslim Brotherhood, which advocates a populist brand of Islam that backed elections in Egypt and Tunisia; the Saudis call the Brotherhood a terrorist group and consider its form of governance a threat to their hereditary rule.
Mr. Erdogan also has links to Iran, Saudi Arabia's chief adversary, and to Qatar, which the kingdom and other Arab nations have boycotted over a political dispute. Over 15 years in power, Mr. Erdogan has steadily consolidated domestic control, jailing dissidents and crushing the independent media.
But he came into this crisis weakened. Turkey was brought to the point of economic distress and diplomatic isolation by Mr. Erdogan's mismanagement, brutish authoritarian ways, corruption and disregard for the rule of law.
His country was isolated from the United States, which imposed sanctions over the detention of an American evangelical pastor, who was released earlier this month, and from other NATO allies in Europe.
For all of Turkey's continuing troubles, Mr. Erdogan has now created an opening for improving relations with Mr. Trump and beginning to reverse its economic decline.
And by spotlighting Saudi Arabia as a murderous neighborhood bully, Mr. Erdogan is now in position to rally the Turkish people around a common enemy, the time-tested tool of the autocrat. He is very likely to emerge from this confrontation even stronger.

Full text: Paul Volcker, wearing a blue sweatsuit and black dress socks, stretched out on a recliner in the den of his Upper East Side apartment on a Sunday afternoon. His lanky 6-foot-7 frame extended beyond the end of the chair's leg rest. He added an ottoman to rest his feet. "I'm not good," said Mr. Volcker, 91, the former Federal Reserve chairman, who came to prominence after he used shockingly high interest rates to help end the runaway inflation of the late 1970s and early '80s. Long one of finance's wise men, he has been sick for several months.
But he would rather not talk about himself. Instead, Mr. Volcker wants to talk about the country, the economy and the government. And if he had seemed lethargic when I arrived, he turned lively in his laments: "We're in a hell of a mess in every direction," he said.
Hundreds of books surrounded Mr. Volcker -- filling shelves and piled high on virtually every flat surface -- as did pink pages of The Financial Times, folded into origami. "Respect for government, respect for the Supreme Court, respect for the president, it's all gone," he said. "Even respect for the Federal Reserve.
"And it's really bad. At least the military still has all the respect. But I don't know, how can you run a democracy when nobody believes in the leadership of the country?"
Before Mr. Volcker fell ill, he finished his memoir, "Keeping at It: The Quest for Sound Money and Good Government." The book was supposed to be published in late November, but given Mr. Volcker's health, its publisher, PublicAffairs, a unit of Hachette, moved its release up to Oct. 30.
"I had no intention of writing a book, but there was something that kind of was irritating me," he said. "I'm really worried about this governance thing."
The book, which Mr. Volcker wrote with Christine Harper, editor in chief of Bloomberg Markets, is a telling memoir about a man who not only redefined the role of Fed chairman but, after the financial crisis, conceived of a namesake rule that eliminated some of the most blatant risk-taking by Wall Street banks. The Volcker Rule, which was part of the Dodd-Frank regulatory legislation, is being chipped away at by Republicans, which doesn't sit well with him.
"There is no force on earth that can stand up effectively, year after year, against the thousands of individuals and hundreds of millions of dollars in the Washington swamp aimed at influencing the legislative and electoral process," he wrote in the book.
The memoir is at times a dishy tale of Mr. Volcker's years in Washington. For example, while President Trump has complained in recent months about the Fed's plan to raise interest rates, he isn't the first to try to influence the independent Federal Reserve. Mr. Volcker recounts being summoned to meet with President Ronald Reagan and his chief of staff, James Baker, in the president's library next to the Oval Office in 1984.
Reagan "didn't say a word," Mr. Volcker wrote. "Instead Baker delivered a message: 'The president is ordering you not to raise interest rates before the election."' Mr. Volcker wasn't planning to raise rates at the time.
"I was stunned," he wrote. "I later surmised that the library location had been chosen because, unlike the Oval Office, it probably lacked a taping system."
The book is not limited to tales of the past, however. It addresses current policy, like the 2 percent inflation target that has become the goal of the Federal Reserve.
"I puzzle at the rationale," he wrote. "A 2 percent target, or limit, was not in my textbook years ago. I know of no theoretical justification."
With a laugh, he told me that he believed the policy was driven by fears of deflation. "And we haven't had any deflation in this country for 90 years!"
But there is something more worrisome affecting policy than fear, he told me. Money.
Over the din of traffic outside an open window, Mr. Volcker hoarsely sounded an alarm on the power it has to shape our culture and our politics.
"The central issue is we're developing into a plutocracy," he told me. "We've got an enormous number of enormously rich people that have convinced themselves that they're rich because they're smart and constructive. And they don't like government, and they don't like to pay taxes."
Washington, when he arrived, "was a city filled with bureaucrats," he said. "It didn't make them bad." At the time, civil servants -- like his father, the township manager of Teaneck, N.J. -- were respected. "I grew up in a world in which good government was a good term," he said.
But things have changed. Today, he said, Washington is overrun by lobbyists and think tanks. Mr. Volcker, who started a nonprofit to improve education for public service, contends that our educational system has been perverted by money.
Schools like the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard and the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton, he said, have failed to educate a new generation of civil servants. He said they no longer taught governing but policy -- a shift that he contended allowed them to hold forums and discussions with generals and under secretaries.
"Rich guys," he said, "like to go." He called it "hobnobbing wholesale."
"They can argue war and peace and poverty and everything else," he said. "But when you go to a school of public policy, you're not learning how to run the goddamn government. You're learning how to debate political issues."
Unlike President Barack Obama, who invited Mr. Volcker to consult on economic and regulatory policy -- and asked him if he would be willing to be Treasury secretary, he said -- this White House hasn't called him. Even so, he has met Mr. Trump twice, both times before he took office.
The first meeting was after Mr. Volcker left the Federal Reserve in 1987. "I was walking down the street, somebody calls out: 'Hey, Paul! Hey, Paul!' He comes running across the street and says, 'Hi, I'm Donald Trump."'
The other was an unsuccessful attempt by Mr. Volcker to get Mr. Trump to use "The Apprentice" to raise money for a charitable organization. "We had a very nice lunch, and he said, 'Interesting idea,' but put me off otherwise," Mr. Volcker said.
Mr. Volcker is no great fan of the president, but he acknowledged that Mr. Trump had cannily recognized the economic worries of blue-collar workers. Mr. Trump "seized upon some issues that the elite had ignored," he said. "I don't think there's any question about that, in kind of an erratic way, but there it is."
He wondered how many lectures and presentations he had sat through with economists "telling us open markets are wonderful, everybody benefits from open markets."
Eventually, Mr. Volcker said, someone in those lectures would always ask, "What about that poor manufacturer in my town?" But that concern was dismissed too easily, with talk of worker retraining or some other solution far easier said than done.
Today, Mr. Volcker is already starting to worry about the next financial crisis. Asked about the stability of the banks, he said, "They're in a stronger position than they were, but the honest answer is I don't know how much they're manipulating."
That, he said, is the real challenge facing economic policymakers. "Everybody talks about monetary policy," he said, "but the lesson of all this is we need better, stronger supervisory powers."
Even as our conversation came to end, Mr. Volcker looked as if he could keep talking for hours. I told him that, rather than look sick or depressed about the state of the world, he appeared energized. Or, I told him, that was at least the impression he left.

Full text: Resort fees. The term conjures up a poolside lounge chair, thick towels piled high nearby. But starting about two years ago, urban luxury and full-service hotels across the United States have increasingly adopted the fees. They may be called amenities or facilities fees and cover less glamorous goods or services like internet access and bottled water. Depending on the hotel, they may be hard to find when a traveler is booking a room online.
But they are profitable for the hotels. Bjorn Hanson, an adjunct professor at the New York University School of Professional Studies Jonathan M. Tisch Center for Hospitality and Tourism, who has researched the fees, said that most of the fee cost goes directly to hotels' bottom lines.
Mr. Hanson projected that total fees and surcharges collected by hotels in the United States will reach a high of $2.93 billion this year, with another record projected in 2019. "The increase for 2018 reflects a combination of approximately 2.5 percent more occupied hotel rooms than in 2017, and 6 percent more fee and surcharge categories and higher amounts," he said.
Robert Mandelbaum, director of research information services for CBRE Hotels' Americas Research, said: "Resort fees are a very profitable way for hotels to raise revenue and not advertise they're raising room rates. By a strict definition, they're not raising room rates but adding a mandatory fee."
The Pierre Hotel in New York City, for instance, imposes a daily surcharge of $30 plus tax for services like high-speed internet access, unlimited local and domestic long-distance calls, bottled water and continental breakfast in the lobby. The $25 daily fee, which does not include tax, charged by the Sofitel Washington DC Lafayette Square includes amenities like premium internet access, access to a bike sharing program, bottled water and yoga classes.
According to the website ResortFeeChecker.com, as of July, 131 hotels in New York charged such a mandatory fee, 25 in Washington, 78 in Los Angeles and 47 in San Francisco.
Last year, Mr. Hanson said, 42 percent of resort hotels charged resort fees, a figure he predicted would remain flat this year. But he estimated that the percentage of urban hotels charging such fees would climb to 8 percent this year from 2 percent last year. He further estimated that the total amount of resort fees collected by urban hotels should climb by $110 million this year. And he said he expected the fees to spread to some second-tier cities and suburban markets next year.
Mr. Hanson said urban hotels' fees are determined and imposed by their local general managers and typically range from $20 to $40 per night, plus local sales tax.
Matt Arrants, executive vice president of Pinnacle Advisory Group, a hospitality consulting company, said urban hotels' fees are proliferating because "hotels can charge them and get them," adding, "People are willing to pay them and hotels consider them a value-add."
One reason guests are willing to pay them, he suggested, is that they have become accustomed to airlines imposing surcharges on everything from baggage checking to in-flight food. "The hotel industry is looking at the airline model and trying to increase revenue opportunities," he said.
"Although the U.S. hotel industry will have the highest occupancy rate in 2018 it has had since 1981, the room rate increase will be only 2.5 to 3 percent," Mr. Hanson said. "At the same time, there's a large increase in labor costs and real estate taxes and rising interest rates. Although occupancies can't go up much more, room rates in many cases are not covering the increased expenses. Hotels thus have an unusual incentive to find additional forms of revenue and profit." The fees are one way. He estimated that 80 to 90 percent of the fees generate profit for hotel owners.
Not surprisingly, travelers' reactions to resort fees charged by both urban hotels and resorts have been negative. Henry Harteveldt, president of Atmosphere Research, a travel research firm, said in a report this year: "Hotel guests flat-out hate resort fees. In our Q1 2018 survey of 3,656 U.S. hotel guests, 91 percent expressed dislike about resort fees. The remaining 9 percent were neutral. No one liked them. Travelers see resort fees for what they are: indirect rate hikes."
Another problem for travelers can be the transparency of urban hotels' fees, since hotels can be inconsistent in revealing fee details on their websites or on websites of online travel agencies. Fee information on smaller hotel booking websites, particularly those operated outside the United States, can be even more spotty.
François-Olivier Luiggi, general manager of the Pierre, which is managed by Taj Hotels, said his hotel imposed its fee in January, when it upgraded its internet access.
"The customer is getting used to fees everywhere," he said. "We feel the fee is less than the combined value of our amenities."
"As a business," he added, "you try to increase your rate every day to match inflation at least, and to find new ways to grow revenue by offering a variety of services and products." He said that guest feedback to the fee has been "excellent," since "we fully disclose it."
A Hilton spokesman, Nigel Glennie, said three of its hotels, all in New York, were testing these fees, which he said were "clearly disclosed during the booking process" and offered guests "a bundle of amenities and services," including premium Wi-Fi, free local calls and a food and beverage voucher. A spokeswoman for IHG, Ada Hatzios, said "less than 3 percent of IHG-branded hotels in the Americas currently have a resort fee, and those that do disclose this to guests during the booking process." A Marriott spokeswoman, Kathleen Duffy, said 14 of its 76 hotels in New York have been testing fees since the summer of 2017. She also said amenities covered by the fees can vary by season. Hyatt, Mandarin Oriental and AccorHotels declined to comment.
Formal actions have been taken against the hotel industry because of the fees. In 2012, the Federal Trade Commission issued a warning letter to hotels that charged resort fees without including them in their advertised daily room rate. In 2016, Thomas Luca Jr., a Pennsylvania traveler who booked a room online at a Wyndham hotel in Miami, sued the company in Federal District Court in Pennsylvania, alleging misrepresentation of its room rates on its website. Last week, he asked that the case be certified as a class action. A Wyndham spokeswoman, Nadeen N. Ayala, said she could not comment on the suit "as it is the subject of pending litigation."
In 2017 the attorney general for the District of Columbia sued to enforce an investigative subpoena it served on Marriott International in connection with a national investigation involving its office and those of attorneys general in 46 states concerning "deceptive price advertising techniques used by the Marriott." All legal cases are pending.
"With record high occupancy levels, especially in major urban markets, the consumer does not have a lot of leverage" over hotels in contesting fees, Mr. Mandelbaum said.
A possible exception, Mr. Hanson said, could be business travelers whose trips are overseen by corporate travel managers, who he said have been contesting fees in negotiations with hotel companies, as have convention planners.
"It's buyer, beware," said Jan Freitag, senior vice president for lodging insights of STR, a hotel research company. "There are still a lot of urban hotels that do not assess the fees. It behooves travelers to do their research before their stay."
Robert Cole, a Dallas-based hotel consultant, warned travelers who book online to carefully study how and where fees are listed on hotel and online travel agency websites. If fees are not revealed at the beginning of the shopping process, a hotel may be inaccurately perceived as cheaper than others.
Longer term, Mr. Harteveldt warned, hotels' fee policies could make them vulnerable. "Home-sharing businesses, such as Airbnb, could also leverage their lack of resort fees," he said, "enabling them to steal more market share away from hotels."
"The Customer Is Getting Used to Fees Everywhere," Said FrançOis-Olivier Luiggi, General Manager of the Pierre Hotel in New York, Which On Top of Room Rates Charges $30 Plus Tax for Use of Amenities Like High-Speed Internet. (Photographs by Jeenah Moon for the New York Times)

Full text: The end of Robert Mueller's investigation. The loss of health insurance for several million people. New laws that make it harder to vote. More tax cuts for the rich. More damage to the environment. A Republican Party molded even more in the image of President Trump. These are among the plausible consequences if the Republicans sweep the midterm elections and keep control of both the House and Senate. And don't fool yourself. That outcome, although not the most likely one, remains possible. The last couple of weeks of polling have shown how it could happen.
Voters who lean Republican -- including whites across the South -- could set aside their disappointment with Trump and vote for Republican congressional candidates. Voters who lean left -- including Latinos and younger adults -- could turn out in low numbers, as they usually do in midterm elections. The Republicans' continuing efforts to suppress turnout could also swing a few close elections.
[ Listen to "The Argument" podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt. ]
No matter what, Democrats will probably win the popular vote in the House elections, for the first time since 2012. Trump, after all, remains unpopular. But the combination of gerrymandering and the concentration of Democratic voters in major cities means that a popular-vote win won't automatically translate into a House majority.
In the Senate, the election already seems to be slipping away from the Democrats. Several of this year's close Senate races happen to involve Democrats defending seats in red states. As a result, Republicans may expand their current 51-49 majority, making it easier for them to win close votes on legislation and nominations.
If Republicans do manage to keep both chambers of Congress, it would cause a political shock. So far, much of the speculation has focused on what a Democratic House takeover might mean -- attempts to rein in Trump's executive actions, subpoenas, investigations, maybe even impeachment. But it's important to understand that a Republican victory would also change Washington.
It would be validation for Trump, who could then brag that he had defied the experts once again. It would mean he had outperformed Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, Ronald Reagan, Lyndon Johnson and Harry Truman, all of whom suffered drubbings in the first midterm election of their presidency. It would embolden Trump to push even harder toward the America he wants -- where corporate oversight is scant, climate change is ignored, voting rights are abridged, health care is a privilege, judicial independence is a fiction and the truth is whatever he says it is.
I obviously find this prospect alarming. I'd much rather spend time imagining the ways the Congress could act as a check on Trump after the Democrats gain some control. And the polls say that's still likely. The political website FiveThirtyEight put the Democrats' odds at around 84 percent on Friday.
Yet all of us should have learned by now that there is a big difference between the unlikely and the impossible. Political polls are like weather forecasts or medical diagnoses. They are a much better guide to the future than random guesses, but they inevitably involve uncertainty. "84 percent" is not just a careful way of saying "100 percent." The Republican Party of Donald Trump really could win the midterms.
That's why I spent a good portion of this past week doing reporting about what two more years of unified Republican rule might look like. The following preview is based on those conversations.
The Russia investigation
Members of Congress don't usually turn against a scandal-marred president from their own party until they believe that supporting him jeopardizes their own careers. That fear helped lead Republicans to abandon Richard Nixon, at long last, in 1974. A lack of fear helps explain why Democrats stuck by Bill Clinton through his sex scandal.
For today's congressional Republicans, the election will be a measure of how worried they need to be about Trump and Russia. As Susan Hennessey of the Brookings Institution says, the midterms "are the last best hope for Republicans in Congress to grow a backbone." A Democratic takeover may make congressional Republicans less willing to make excuses for Trump. A Republican victory would suggest that the party does not need to be very scared about the politics of Russia.
Yes, Mueller -- the special counsel overseeing the investigation -- could change that by issuing an explosive report after the election. But a midterm victory could also give Trump the confidence to shut down the investigation, through firing some combination of Mueller, Rod Rosenstein (who oversees Mueller) and Jeff Sessions, the attorney general. In their place, he could install loyalists unconcerned with the quaint notion that no one is above the law. An expanded Senate majority could ease the confirmation of those loyalists.
Even if Mueller's findings eventually became public, an unfinished report is different from a completed investigation that could include indictments of people close to Trump. It's easy to imagine Trump waving it away as a "witch hunt." Congressional Republicans may go even further and hold hearings investigating the investigators -- the current and former law-enforcement officials whom Trump has unjustly blamed for the investigation.
Altogether, an election victory would probably give Trump the confidence to do what he has already signaled he wants to do: use the law as an instrument of political power rather than one of justice.
Health care
The Republican agenda on health care is deeply unpopular. It revolves around less insurance for the middle class and poor, to pay for tax cuts. In response, many Republicans have begun telling flat-out falsehoods about their positions on health care.
Now imagine if the party nonetheless won the midterms. "They will have learned a very specific lesson," Jacob Leibenluft of the liberal Center for American Progress said. "They can get away with lying about what their actual policy is."
There is every reason to believe Republicans would then try to cut health care funding more deeply. People in Republican circles told me that they did not anticipate a new attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act. "I would expect them to make some kind of run on health care again," Ryan Streeter of the conservative American Enterprise Institute said, "but I would be surprised if they tried for full repeal." Douglas Holtz-Eakin of the American Action Forum called repeal "a political rallying cry" and "not a legislative agenda."
I'm not so sure. Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, suggested on Wednesday that Republicans would reconsider repeal if they kept Congress. Last year, it failed by only a single vote in the Senate -- the vote of John McCain, who has since died.
"We should always assume that as soon as they have the votes, they will repeal the rest of the A.C.A.," said Andy Slavitt, who ran Medicare and Medicaid under Obama. Even if they don't, Slavitt added, they will probably make other cuts. Medicaid -- which serves the poor, working class, disabled and elderly -- is a likely target.
Other legislation
For decades now, the No. 1 Republican policy priority has been tax cuts that mostly benefit the rich. The only major piece of legislation signed by Trump was such a tax cut. Next year, there could be more cuts. One possibility would be the repeal of the estate tax, which applies to only a tiny fraction of the wealthiest households, said Jeffrey Miron of Harvard and the Cato Institute. Another possibility would be a technical change in inflation measurement, resulting in a large cut in investment taxes.
Apart from taxes, the party could try to go further to block corporate regulation. Right now, regulation tends to swing back and forth, depending on who holds the White House, but some congressional Republicans want to change that. They support a bill that would constrain future presidents from imposing regulations, in the name of reducing consumer costs. Liberal analysts have nicknamed it the "License to Kill Bill," citing its effects on pollution, consumer safety and worker safety.
The most tempting Republican legislation may be one that involves political power rather than any specific policy area. Over the past decade, the party has become much more aggressive about restricting voting access, especially for Democratic-leaning groups like African-Americans and Native Americans. So far, these laws have been passed in states, rather than at federal level. But Myrna Pérez of the Brennan Center for Justice told me that she was worried that the state laws -- like those requiring new forms of identification or reducing voting hours and polling places -- could become a model for a federal law.
The goal would be as obvious as it is nefarious: Keep Republicans in power, even when they lack the support of most Americans.
The list here is clearly speculative, and not comprehensive. A Republican sweep would also ease the confirmation of federal judges, and it might encourage still harsher treatment of immigrants. Beyond any specific piece of legislation, though, a Republican victory would send a message. It would be an endorsement (albeit a flawed one, probably based on a popular-vote loss) of Trump's vision for America.
In that America, congenital liars and sexual harassers don't get punished. They can become president. In that America, people with dark skin aren't guaranteed the same rights as people with white skin, and a violently warming planet is less important than corporate profits. In that America, the federal government protects the wealthy and powerful, often at the expense of everyone else.
By now, no one should have any illusions about how Trump will behave if he faces no restraints.

The Secret Lives of Central Bankers

Full text: A few years ago, a senior Japanese central banker let me in on a secret side of his life: Like some others in his rarefied world, he is a passionate devotee of Sherlock Holmes. After formal meetings in capitals around the world, he joins the other Sherlock Holmes buffs over drinks or dinner for trivia competitions, to test their knowledge of obscure plot details, or to share amateur historical research into Victorian London. It is all very casual, but the camaraderie is important to him. Through this informal fan club, the banker told me, he had made his closest professional friendships. "I feel closer to many of these people than to many of my countrymen," he said.
As an anthropologist, I have spent 20 years studying the customs, beliefs and rituals of central bankers around the world. They see themselves as jacks-of-all-financial-trades who solve complex financial crises before they can damage the unsuspecting public. They are as clever as the extraordinarily wealthy banking executives whom they regulate, but motivated by higher ideals. So it made sense that the aloof and justifiably arrogant Sherlock Holmes might represent for them an ideal of masculine brilliance (they are mostly still men), rationality and self-control. Like Holmes, central bankers consider their detachment an asset.
But in the real world, this high-mindedness has come at a cost. In the United States, President Trump has suggested that the Federal Reserve is not doing "what's good for the country," and on Tuesday he told Fox Business that the Fed was his "biggest threat." He said that it was "raising rates too fast, and it's too independent." So far, the Fed chairman has remained above the political fray. But if the president persuades enough Americans that the Fed's decisions to raise interest rates, which would make their credit cards and mortgages more expensive, are to blame for their financial troubles, principled silence may not be enough.
The acculturation process for central bankers begins early. Most of them attend a handful of elite universities -- the University of Chicago, Harvard, Yale, Oxford, Cambridge -- to study neoclassical economics, and their early training often involves a secondment to the central banking institutions of another country. In Tokyo or Frankfurt or New York, they operate within a closed set.
There are norms of dress: sharp, conservative suits and dark ties, but never fancy shoes. (Janet Yellen's decision to remove her jacket at a summertime meeting once caused a stir.) And many central bankers date their lives according to memories of certain key international banking agreements: Basel I and Basel II are, for them, like the fall of the Berlin Wall or the Sept. 11 attacks.
This world is beginning to feel like an anachronism, especially after the financial crisis of 2008. When markets fail to respond to monetary policy as the science says that they should, the public loses faith in experts. And it may not be possible for the informal and secretive craft of central banking to continue its traditions in a world that demands greater transparency and accountability. This tradition of the apolitical central banker isn't even very well established. It goes back only to the late 1980s and early 1990s, when a flurry of academic research suggested that independent central banks were correlated with lower inflation -- a priority at the time for the United States.
In response to criticism, many central banks are trying to diversify their work forces and share more details about the deliberations of their monetary policy committees.
But these steps have been far too modest. Central banks should think more boldly about diversity, by welcoming not just more women and people of color, but also more people with real-world economic and business expertise, rather than only Ph.D.s. Central bankers already meet regularly with academics and financial institutions such as Goldman Sachs. Why not also meet with civil society groups that critique their work?
Central bankers should also consider the divisions in their own elite world. At one closed-door meeting that I organized, a central banker from South Asia complained to the ones from the United States and Europe, in essence: You guys meet the night before at your private club, and then you show up here, and the decisions have already been made.
The man he was challenging wasn't embarrassed. Instead, he said, in effect: Well, if you could just learn to play by the rules, then you could be part of that club. Look at the Japanese. They've learned all the rules, and now look where they are.
This arrogance, toward the public and even toward one another, undermines central banks' effectiveness. One of the goals of monetary policy is to shape people's behavior. When a central bank says it anticipates that prices are going to rise, it expects the public to take that advice seriously. If people do, and they buy things now before prices rise, then perhaps prices won't rise as much. But central banks need credibility for this stabilizing mechanism to work.
Some countries do have this level of public trust, built carefully over decades. In Denmark, for example, central bank officials make a concerted effort, in speeches and other public comments, to tell the story of how their work contributes to the egalitarian society that Danes value. Danes love their central bank.
There are still, of course, central bankers who argue that they should preserve their mystique or people won't respect them. Others believe that close ties among central bank officials benefit everyone: The 2008 crisis, for example, might have been much worse if they did not have such open lines of communications. One central banker I know, from one of the Group of 7 countries, spoke movingly about how much he valued his deep personal relationships with leaders at the People's Bank of China. He said both sides shared quite sensitive information and did whatever they could, within the boundaries of their professional obligations, to support one another.
In an era of increasing economic nationalism, this cosmopolitan culture may be difficult to maintain.
Holmes never worried about this sort of thing. In "A Study in Scarlet," upon being told that the earth in fact revolves around the sun, Holmes declares, "What the deuce is it to me?" Dr. Watson is shocked, but Holmes insists, "If we went round the moon it would not make a pennyworth of difference to me or my work." His central banking acolytes may not be so lucky.
