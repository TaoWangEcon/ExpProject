Abstract: According to a recent report by Reform, a right-leaning research organization based in London, two-thirds of the cost of Britain's substantial public services bill is to be found in its work force -- a six-million-strong army that runs the gamut from low-paid midwives in country villages to higher education officials in London who are paid like corporate executives.

Full text: MIDDLESBROUGH, England -- It is by far the largest employer in town, accounting for one out of every two jobs. Its workers are teachers, doctors, museum curators and social workers whose salaries range from $:21,000 to $:210,000 a year.
The employer is the government, and the responsibility of its 17,000 employees here has been to work the levers of Britain's expansive welfare state. Now, for the first time in a generation, this public colossus is shrinking -- threatened by rising levels of government debt and the political bent of the Conservative Party government -- and many of the jobs are being cut.
Throughout Britain, austerity will result in many thousands of lost public jobs, compounding the blow from reduced entitlements. But the cuts will be most keenly felt across the iron and steel belt of this country's depressed northeast, in places like Middlesbrough, which in many ways is a British version of Detroit.
This faded industrial town of 134,000 long ago became dependent on government largess as factories closed, and some of the now-unemployed government workers are in a state of shock. Michael Carter of Middlesbrough, 49, was laid off last November -- after 25 years in the public sector -- from his job as an accountant in Britain's mammoth National Health Service. As he exited the town's bustling unemployment office recently, he worried that the shrinking of the welfare state meant he, too, would join the swelling ranks of long-term jobless.
"You just have to keep looking -- but it's hard," he said. "There are just so few public sector jobs out there right now." And private sector employment, in Mr. Carter's view, isn't even worth mentioning, given that Britain's wobbly economy is creating few jobs, especially outside London.
Many European countries and American states face similar issues, but large areas of Britain are finding the cuts especially painful. Public employment has grown persistently since the end of World War II as the infrastructure of Europe's first welfare state was put in place and grew under Conservative and Labour Party governments alike.
Now plagued by one of the highest budget deficits in Europe -- only Greece and Ireland are expected to surpass Britain's deficit of 7.9 percent of G.D.P. this year -- the Conservative-led government has said that many of these jobs must go and has cut spending for local governments throughout the country.
According to a recent report by Reform, a right-leaning research organization based in London, two-thirds of the cost of Britain's substantial public services bill is to be found in its work force -- a six-million-strong army that runs the gamut from low-paid midwives in country villages to higher education officials in London who are paid like corporate executives.
Half of the jobs in Middlesbrough are publicly supported -- via the town council, its publicly financed university and a state-owned hospital -- and with 14 percent of residents on some form of jobless benefit, the government's hand seems omnipresent in Middlesbrough.
In some cases the hand can be generous: Ian Parker, the chief executive of Middlesbrough's town council and the man responsible for managing its $:136 million budget, made $:155,644 (about $250,000) last year -- more than Prime Minister David Cameron.
In other cases, less so: Ian Campbell is struggling to support his family of four on the $:21,000 (slightly less than $34,000) a year he is paid by the council to manage one of its parks.
But, for better or for worse, starting April 1, Middlesbrough's town council -- which not only pays for projects that tackle ills like teenage pregnancy and chronic unemployment but also sponsors classes that teach parents how to play outdoors with their children -- must start telling its 7,000 employees that the jobs they once thought were for life are no longer secure.
"These cuts are too deep, too soon and too savage," said Ray Mallon, the town's independent mayor, who has cultivated a national reputation by lashing out at what he calls the heartlessness of the government's austerity program -- one that he says in the end will simply add to the government's social burden. "Sixteen out of our 23 boroughs are already socially deprived. Now we are going to have to lose another 500 people in the coming four years, which will just increase the size of the welfare state."
With his perfectly coiffed hair, slick suit and suspenders and his media-savvy ways, Mr. Mallon brings a dash of razzle-dazzle to the generally colorless routine of municipal life in postindustrial Middlesbrough, with its abandoned steel mills and hollowed-out town center.
A recent day filled with discussions of what to cut, and when, illustrated what Mr. Mallon views as the human cost of the cuts. In one meeting, a local homeless charity heavily dependent on public money told the mayor that its operations would be severely constrained with reduced funding. At another, Mr. Mallon gave an emotional farewell to the woman who had brewed tea for the council. She was accepting an offer to take early retirement.
"All good things must come to an end," he said to a packed room of council workers and the tearful employee. "Some of you may want to go, some of you may not want to go -- but I am afraid that many of you will have to go."
The British recovery has been fragile, with growth declining 0.6 percent last quarter. Mr. Mallon, the opposition Labour Party and some economists say that the cuts run the risk of plunging the economy back into recession.
The Conservative-led government sharply disputes that contention. It argues that a boom in government spending over the last decade produced not just a wave of overpaid local government officials but also a culture of wasteful spending that is ripe for the pruning. Indeed, for all the hue and cry, the Middlesbrough council is expected to shed not too much more than 5 percent of its work force.
In particular, public scrutiny has focused on administrators at the councils who in some cases earn salaries in excess of $:200,000.
According to the TaxPayers' Alliance, a public sector watchdog, the pay of Middlesbrough's chief executive, $:155,644, exceeds the average pay of $:147,000 for council heads nationwide, even though his council is one of Britain's poorest.
"I agree -- my C.E.O.'s pay is too much," said Mr. Mallon. But he argues that in light of the savings of $:50 million that Middlesbrough must produce in the coming four years, taking a 10 percent bite out of Mr. Parker's paycheck would hardly make a difference.
That may be so, but it is small comfort to Mr. Campbell, the parks worker, who has had no pay increase to speak of over the last two years even as inflation pushes above 5 percent.
"I am getting hammered," said Mr. Campbell, who has two children and a wife who works as well. "All of a sudden you start to notice the small things. We used to order Indian takeaway every few weeks. Now we have stopped that."
Social workers here say that even though the bulk of the job losses have not yet hit, the unease -- compounded by the sharp increase in the cost of living -- is spreading. Homelessness has already increased, as have reports of people rifling through trash bins for food.
Mr. Campbell, who has never worked in the private sector, is not sure whether his position will survive the coming cuts, but he is certain of one thing: if he does lose his job, there is little hope of him getting a private sector position in the area.
Some think, though, that a bit of tough love is just what Middlesbrough needs to wean it from decades of embracing public jobs and benefits.
"We are very consumerist in how we see care, education -- all aspects of the welfare state here," said Tracey Brittain, a probation worker who also runs a volunteer organization that helps people find their way home at night after they drink too much. "It's as if we have a right to all that. What we really need is for people to take more responsibility."

Full text: Four years ago, there were fears of a financial meltdown -- a term borrowed from the nuclear power industry. Now there are fears of a real meltdown.
Comparing the two events may risk seeming insensitive to the rising human toll in northern Japan, but there are similarities in causation. In each case, overconfidence born of experience led to increased risks once a disaster unfolded.
Fortunately, there is reason to hope that the worst fears will not be realized. When -- let us hope it is not "if" -- the radiation releases are controlled, Japan can begin to rebuild and the worst economic fears could prove to be as exaggerated as the depression fears that paralyzed financial markets two years ago.
In the years preceding each meltdown, the very act of reducing apparent risks may have increased actual risks. In the world of finance, there was a general acceptance of the idea that banks and their regulators had developed sophisticated risk models to prevent a disaster. As lending grew more reckless, there was confidence that no real risks were being taken.
In Japan, the risks of earthquake and tsunami were well known, and believed to have been dealt with. An earthquake could damage a nuclear plant and its vital cooling process if power to the reactor were cut off. So backup generators were built and batteries installed to provide power even if the generator did not immediately kick in. A tsunami could cause flooding. So huge sea walls were built to prevent floods.
All the precautions had worked in previous earthquakes, and that history was reassuring.
Unfortunately, it appears that those building the nuclear plants assumed that the risk from tsunamis had been eliminated by the precautions that others took. The backup generators were behind the flood walls, but they were not on high ground, as would have seemed necessary without faith in the walls. So the generators flooded and the cooling systems broke down. That led to radiation releases. Whether it will lead to something much worse is still unknown.
In the world of finance, the assumption that safeguards would prevent disaster led people to believe it was safe to borrow heavily. There had, after all, been a prolonged period in which markets were not turbulent and there were only profits, not losses, to be realized from taking on the additional risk of leverage. As the economist Hyman Minsky wrote years earlier, "stability is destabilizing" because it encourages confidence that benign circumstances will endure.
We learned from the financial crisis that the comfortable assurances that authorities knew what to do were misplaced. Central bankers had insisted that it was futile and unnecessary for them to look out for bubbles, since they knew how to deal with the results if one did burst. The 2001 recession after the collapse of the technology stock bubble was both short and mild. The Federal Reserve emerged triumphant, its wisdom and capabilities widely admired.
But this time it turned out that easing monetary policy was not nearly enough, and the United States will be dealing for years with problems caused by homeowners who are -- to use another term that seems newly inappropriate -- underwater. Many, but not all, of those once-confident central bankers now say they were wrong.
It has become clear that the Japanese nuclear industry was ill equipped to deal with the current disaster. Otherwise the cooling systems would have continued functioning even if the earthquake had disabled plants. The cost -- in lives and yen -- is as yet unknown.
Each case -- a collapse of house prices and a cascade of problems threatening a large release of radiation -- was viewed as so improbable that it could be virtually ignored in considering risks. Those who counseled otherwise were viewed as alarmists.
What was not considered sufficiently, perhaps, is just how serious an unlikely risk may be. If it is bad enough, the risk may not be worth taking, no matter how good the odds. There is a reason people do not play Russian roulette, even if the odds are highly favorable. It is a game you lose only once.
At a time when brave workers are risking death from radiation, when whole communities have been destroyed by the tsunami and survivors are suffering in makeshift shelters, it seems inhuman to even suggest that of the two meltdowns, the financial one was worse. Bank failures do not kill people.
In economic terms, however, the financial crisis was extraordinary. It caused world gross domestic product to fall 1.5 percent in 2009, according to World Bank calculations. Nothing like that happened during the severe downturns of the 1970s and 1980s. The early estimates of the impact of the disaster in Japan suggest that economic damages will be far less, even though Japan accounts for almost 9 percent of world G.D.P.
But those damages will be significant, and that significance is only increased by the fact the financial crisis weakened developed economies and left governments with vastly increased debts. Even assuming that the radiation damage does not permanently scar a significant part of Japan, that country's output will fall sharply for a time, and that time could be extended if rolling blackouts remain necessary. Some of that slack could be made up by non-Japanese companies, but in some industries they will be hampered by a shortage of needed components from Japan.
We owe the concept of "just-in-time" inventories to Japan. Now that practice could make the temporary damage to world growth all the more severe. Shortages of some products could drive up prices, making inflation numbers around the world that much worse.
It is, in other words, a recipe for 1970s style stagflation, at least briefly.
Japan's plight could be worsened by the fact that many Japanese did not buy earthquake insurance, and most such policies that do exist pay half or less of the damage if a home is destroyed. Through a complicated arrangement, the Japanese government is responsible for much of the insurance liability, and if the affected areas are to be rebuilt much of the cost will fall to the government, whether or not the properties had insurance.
Fortunately, there are few countries as well equipped as Japan for the task.
That statement may seem surprising given the attention paid to the large Japanese government debt, which has led to almost hysterical warnings in some circles about an eventual default. How can this overextended government borrow more money?
As it happens, Japan owes the money almost entirely to itself. The private sector has ample resources. Moreover, Japan borrows in yen, the same currency the government can print. Default worries are absurd.
On March 10, the day before the earthquake and tsunami struck, Japanese five-year bonds yielded 0.57 percent. A week later, the yield had fallen to 0.51 percent. That is hardly the sign of fearful investors. Instead, it reflects a flight to safety.
In addition, Japan has the industrial base to undertake rebuilding. It will not need to import workers or expertise.
Finally, the Japanese economy is anything but overheated. There is plenty of spare capacity. Michael T. Darda, the chief economist of MKM Partners, a Connecticut-based research firm, points out that Japan's G.D.P. is now lower than it was in the early 1990s, when expressed in nominal yen. Adjusted for deflation, there has been some growth, but not much.
If ever there was an economy that needed some stimulus, this is the one. The Bank of Japan now has a good reason to print money.
"Considering Japan's limited capacity to take on more debt due to its already high debt/G.D.P. ratio, and impending pressures on domestic savings from an aging population," Mr. Darda wrote, "reflation and debt monetization seem like the most likely path forward."
For now, it seems reasonable to think that ordinary Japanese may cut back on spending for nonessentials, much as Americans did after Sept. 11, causing further weakness in the economy. Hoarding of some goods -- among them milk and gasoline -- appears to be happening in areas far removed from the crisis.
The economy is unlikely to stabilize until the nuclear situation is clearly under control, essential goods readily available and survivors living in conditions worthy of a wealthy nation. Only then will the country be in a position to assess how badly it has been hurt and begin the recovery process.
This tragedy has destroyed many lives and much wealth. There is a risk that the government's response will anger rather than unify the Japanese people, and that a crisis careering out of control will only worsen a reputation of incompetence and indecision that has grown as the country's economy stumbled through the last two decades.
But there is a chance that the crisis could encourage a national unity of purpose, as Sept. 11 did for a time in the United States. If the Japanese government can maintain that sense of unity and show a new ability to act decisively and effectively, an economic disaster need not be part of the horrible legacy of the March 11 earthquake.

Shares Rally as Panic Over Japan Eases

Full text: Stocks staged a broad relief rally as panic about the nuclear crisis in Japan seemed to abate temporarily and markets were reassured by an intervention by the Group of 7 industrialized nations to help stabilize the yen.
Analysts say the gains reflect the market's sense that a severe nuclear catastrophe that seemed possible at the end of the day on Wednesday appeared far less likely Thursday morning.
"When we didn't have a nuclear meltdown overnight, cooler heads prevailed," said Tobias Levkovich, chief United States equity strategist of Citigroup. "And a lot of traders came to the realization that while what happened in Japan is incredibly tragic and hard to watch and comprehend, its global impact is probably more muted than we initially thought."
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose by 1.3 percent, up 16.84 points to 1,273.72, its first positive day this week. The Dow Jones industrial average added 161.29 points, or 1.4 percent, to close at 11,774.59, while the Nasdaq composite index edged up 0.7 percent, adding 19.23 points to close at 2,636.05.
With worries about radioactive fallout easing, traders began to speculate on which sectors would benefit from eventual efforts to rebuild the stricken parts of Japan. The largest gains on Thursday came from sectors that could profit from reconstruction.
Telecommunications stocks in the S.& P. 500 were up 2 percent, and energy stocks were up 3 percent. Among the biggest winners of the day were Pioneer Drilling, which jumped by 6.4 percent, and Noble Energy, which climbed 5.3 percent.
Stocks in the S.& P. 500 are still down 2.4 percent from the end of last week. But on Thursday, the market was ready for a rebound after being whipsawed by the flow of chaotic news from Japan.
"The markets on Wednesday reacted to every bit of information that hit the tapes and a lot of that was contradictory," said Tom Porcelli, chief United States economist at RBC Capital Markets. "From a larger perspective, at least for a moment, a bit of calm has entered the markets."
On Friday, the Nikkei 225 index was up 1.77 percent at the midday break. After the markets in Japan opened, the United States and other major economies said that they would join Japan in a highly unusual effort to stabilize the value of the yen by intervening in currency markets.
Markets responded immediately by driving down the value of the yen against the dollar, with spot prices trading at 81.45 yen to the dollar Friday morning. The yen had been creeping up since the devastating earthquake and tsunami that battered northeastern Japan last Friday. It had strengthened sharply to 76.53 yen to the dollar in New York on Thursday.
Shares closed higher in Europe on Thursday. The Euro Stoxx 50, a benchmark of blue chips, added 2.4 percent and the DAX gained 2.2 percent in Frankfurt. In London, the FTSE rose 1.75 percent, and the CAC 40 in Paris added 2.4 percent.
As of Thursday, the Nikkei 225 was still down 14 percent from its level before the earthquake.
In the United States, markets were lifted by strong economic news that overshadowed the worries in Japan. First-time claims for unemployment benefits fell to 385,000 last week, which was slightly more than expected.
In addition, a survey from the Federal Reserve of Philadelphia showed that manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic region rose in February to the highest point since January 1984.
The report is "a reminder that the U.S. economy continues to gain momentum," Alan Gayle, senior investment strategist at RidgeWorth Investments in Richmond, Va., told The Associated Press. "Economic growth leads to more spending, more production and ultimately rising profits," he said. "That's what investors buy: rising profits."
Inflation, however, edged higher in February. The Consumer Price Index rose 0.5 percent last month, also more than forecast. Core prices, which exclude food and fuel costs, rose 0.2 percent.
The rally in stocks led to a sell-off in bonds. The price for 10-year benchmark Treasury bonds fell 19/32, to 103 3/32, while the yields rose to 3.26 percent from 3.19 percent late Wednesday.
Oil prices rose to more than $100 a barrel again, gaining $3.44 to settle at $101.42 in New York, as turmoil continued in North Africa and the Middle East. Gold prices also rose $4.84, to $1,403.72 an ounce.
Elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific region on Friday, the S.& P./ASX index in Australia gained 1 percent in morning trading, and the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong rose 0.46 percent in early trading.

Rent? Buy? As They Say, It Depends

Full text: Last week the Appraisal column explored whether it was worth it to residents of Cobble Hill Towers in Brooklyn to buy their apartments. For one young family, it made sense. For another longtime resident, there were better deals to be found elsewhere. The City Room blog asked readers to weigh in on the issue: Is it better to rent or to buy?
Here are a few responses:
If you can get your hands on a decent rent-stabilized apartment, then rent.
If not, and if you are in for the long haul, buying allows you to fix a huge portion of your expenses and makes more sense where costs are comparable. It also lets you keep a foot in the market, which is essential protection if prices increase drastically. Paul '52
Well, I was a renter in Manhattan for many, many years and now own. My very last apartment in the East Village was 750 square feet. The apartment I bought is 1,000 square feet, and my mortgage and maintenance combined equals my rent from 10 years ago! If you can, I would strongly recommend buying. Renting is a waste of your money. Andrea
I rent in Brooklyn, and I'd like to buy, in theory. I've had a decent rent for the past 15 years, and, at the same time, I've also been feverishly saving for a down payment. I used to say that my deadline for buying is when my rent (which goes up every year by somewhere between 3 and 5 percent) reaches the cost of monthly mortgage plus maintenance of a comparable co-op. It hasn't happened yet. The prices to buy keep going up and my rent is still significantly cheaper than a mortgage and maintenance, even at its most recent increase to $1,450 a month. GK from BK
The real estate in New York City is overpriced. I am not even thinking about buying an apartment here (even though I can easily afford one, assuming that I take a mortgage). For the same amount I can purchase a nice house in Costa Rica, the Philippines or Thailand (where I plan to retire anyway), and pay cash. Kostas
Rent.
Real estate equity will build very slowly if at all over the next decade. Therefore the down payment would be better invested in the stock market, which is the only place the government or Federal Reserve Board is focusing on economic recovery.
I might need to relocate for any number of reasons, and I do not want that flexibility to be hampered by an inability to sell or by a loss of investment from having to sell in a slow real estate market.
Rent is less expensive than a mortgage and maintenance; maintenance can increase at the whim of a condo or co-op board. Rent will remain market driven, with the ability to relocate somewhere if it goes up too much.
This is from an ex-owner who will never buy again. Norman
I bought a couple of years ago a three-bedroom apartment in Washington Heights for less than $100,000. Being a cash deal, I was able to negotiate down the price. I invested another $50,000 or so in gutting it completely, but now I own a beautiful apartment, without a mortgage and with low maintenance fees ($500 per month). These deals still exist, and are definitely better than renting in the city. buywithoutmortgage!
I rent in a gorgeous Brooklyn neighborhood that I couldn't possibly afford to buy in -- $1.8 million is what houses on my street sell for! In 15 years I retire. Since I don't plan to stay in the United States after retirement (I'm British), I'm now planning to buy my retirement home in a sunny European country where homes are vastly cheaper. Ron C
Location, location. I have lived in the city, Manhattan, since I was 5 years old. And I can't imagine myself living anywhere else. I have rented and I have bought -- and owning is really much nicer.
When you own, there is a feeling of permanence, particularly when decorating or renovating your apartment. But nowadays, buying in the city is absurd -- ads for apartments in desirable areas "start at $1.5 million" for a not-very-large space. The amenities now include workout rooms, spas, entertainment areas and the like, which all add up in maintenance and other fees. So, even though owning your own place is preferable, renting is much more doable in Manhattan now. Not a terrible option if you get lucky and find an apartment in a nice neighborhood. jblee
The age-old question for New Yorkers. ...
The answer depends on your situation, but with the current housing market, I would buy now. If you can afford to buy it will be worth it in 5 to 10 years, when property values skyrocket again.
Extremely low interest rates combined with distressed sellers makes a good investment very possible. Also, property ownership is a fairly decent hedge against currency inflation.
Obviously all this depends on the space, down payments, tax deductions, etc.
If you can afford it, buy it. If not, rent it. Chris

Full text: Washington
ANY American who has shopped for groceries or pumped gasoline in the last few months knows that prices for food and energy have been soaring. Demand from fast-growing Asian economies is one major contributor to price increases; the turmoil in the Middle East is another.
All of this has made some economists and lawmakers in the United States nervous. They fear that higher prices for commodities will translate into higher prices for all goods and services and that the Federal Reserve, by ignoring commodity prices, has become lax on inflation.
While the anxiety is understandable, the fears are misplaced. They result from a profound misunderstanding about whether food and energy prices today help predict overall inflation tomorrow.
There are two fundamental measures of inflation: overall (or "headline") inflation and "core" inflation, which excludes food and energy prices because they are very volatile and mostly transitory and as a result don't necessarily reflect underlying inflation trends. A central objective of the Fed's monetary policy is price stability, defined as a low, steady rate of overall inflation. So are rising food and gas prices a sign that the Fed is falling down on the job?
The answer is no. There is very little that the Fed can do to control today's inflation, whether core or headline. What the Fed does influence is inflation a year or two down the road, which is why it needs to look to the future, not overreact to the present.
The most significant question for the Fed, then, is whether overall or core inflation right now is a more reliable gauge of where headline inflation will be next year. And the data unequivocally tell us that core inflation better predicts overall inflation tomorrow.
Given that core inflation is close to 1 percent, overall inflation next year will likely also end up at about 1 percent, well below the Fed's almost explicit objective of 2 percent.
But wait a moment, the Fed's critics say. They like to point out that the data haven't always told the same story about the link between underlying and overall inflation.
For instance, during the 1970s and early 1980s, an era of debilitating inflation, the markets had no confidence in the Fed's ability to keep prices stable. This meant that any increase in prices, including those for volatile items like food and energy, were almost immediately and fully translated into expectations of higher overall inflation in the future. Those expectations, in turn, gave rise to actual increases in other prices, not just food and energy. (If workers expect that inflation will be 2 percent in the coming year, they will demand a wage increase that is 2 percentage points higher than they otherwise would to keep improving their standard of living.)
So in the '70s, increases in food and gas prices affected both core and overall inflation. Some believe this is still the case today. But it isn't.
Since the inflationary era ended in the early '80s, the Fed has earned a reputation for keeping inflation in check. For more than a decade, the markets have operated under the assumption that in the long term inflation will be stable. This means that spikes in food and energy prices do not get translated into expectations of higher inflation down the road and thus do not lead to a general increase in prices, today or tomorrow. In light of the evidence, the Fed is right to pay more attention to core inflation than to overall inflation when making decisions about interest rates.
Critics who want the Fed to raise rates immediately in response to rising food and energy prices also tend to be skeptics of the Fed's decision last year to pump $600 billion into the economy by purchasing Treasury securities -- even though, in my view, the two phenomena are entirely separate.
The skeptics point out that the Fed's purchases, which were intended to lower unemployment by making borrowing cheaper and thus encouraging businesses to hire, "monetize" the nation's debt, meaning that the Fed is essentially printing money to finance the government. That in turn is said to increase the risk of substantially higher inflation expectations and, eventually, overall inflation.
The Fed, this argument goes, just won't be able to act quickly enough to turn off the spigot when the time comes to do so.
But the Fed can raise interest rates directly any time it wants. In addition, it could start to sell the huge volume of Treasury securities and other financial assets on its books, which would also place upward pressure on rates.
Would the Fed act in time? I expect that it will. And even if it doesn't act in time, and inflation expectations start to get out of line, I am confident that the Fed would tighten monetary policy quickly and aggressively enough to restore price stability and maintain its credibility on inflation. You can take that to the bank.

Full text: CORRECTION APPENDED
Geraldine A. Ferraro, the former Queens congresswoman who strode onto a podium in 1984 to accept the Democratic nomination for vice president and to take her place in American history as the first woman nominated for national office by a major party, died Saturday in Boston.
She was 75 and lived in Manhattan.
The cause was complications from multiple myeloma, a blood cancer that she had battled for 12 years, her family said in a statement. She died at Massachusetts General Hospital, where she had been undergoing treatment since Monday.
"If we can do this, we can do anything," Ms. Ferraro declared on a July evening to a cheering Democratic National Convention in San Francisco. And for a moment, for the Democratic Party and for an untold number of American women, anything seemed possible: a woman occupying the second-highest office in the land, a derailing of the Republican juggernaut led by President Ronald Reagan, a President Walter F. Mondale.
It did not turn out that way -- not by a long shot. After the roars in the Moscone Center had subsided and a fitful general election campaign had run its course, hopes for Mr. Mondale and his plain-speaking, barrier-breaking running mate were buried in a Reagan landslide.
But Ms. Ferraro's supporters proclaimed a victory of sorts nonetheless: 64 years after women won the right to vote, a woman had removed the "men only" sign from the White House door.
It would be another 24 years before another woman from a major party was nominated for vice president -- Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska, the Republican running mate of Senator John McCain, in 2008. And though Hillary Rodham Clinton came close to being nominated that year as the Democratic presidential candidate, a woman has yet to occupy the Oval Office. But Ms. Ferraro's ascendance gave many women heart.
Ann Richards, who was the Texas state treasurer at the time and went on to become governor, recalled that after the Ferraro nomination, "the first thing I thought of was not winning in the political sense, but of my two daughters."
"To think," Ms. Richards added, "of the numbers of young women who can now aspire to anything."
In a statement, President Obama said Saturday, "Geraldine will forever be remembered as a trailblazer who broke down barriers for women and Americans of all backgrounds and walks of life."
As Mr. Mondale's surprise choice, Ms. Ferraro rocketed to national prominence, propelled by fervid feminist support, a spirited and sometimes saucy personality, canny political skills and the calculation by Democratic strategists that Reagan might be vulnerable on issues thought to be more important to women.
But it proved to be a difficult campaign. The incumbent Reagan-Bush ticket presented a formidable enough challenge in and of itself, but Ms. Ferraro found herself on the defensive almost from the start, answering critics who questioned her qualifications for high office. Then there were damaging revelations about the finances of her husband, John Zaccaro, forcing Ms. Ferraro to release his tax returns and hold a marathon news conference in the middle of the general election race. Some said she had become a liability to Mr. Mondale and only hurt his chances more.
Quick Study as Candidate
A former Queens criminal prosecutor, Ms. Ferraro was a vigorous but relatively inexperienced candidate with a better feel for urban ward politics than for international diplomacy. But she proved to be a quick study and came across as a new breed of feminist politician -- comfortable with the boys, particularly powerful Democrats like the House speaker, Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., and less combative than predecessors like Representative Bella Abzug of New York.
She was also ideal for television: a down-to-earth, streaked-blond, peanut-butter-sandwich-making mother whose personal story resonated powerfully. Brought up by a single mother who had crocheted beads on wedding dresses to send her daughter to good schools, Ms. Ferraro had waited until her own children were school age before going to work in a Queens district attorney's office headed by a cousin.
In the 1984 race, many Americans found her breezy style refreshing. "What are you -- crazy?" was a familiar expression. She might break into a little dance behind the speaker's platform when she liked the introductory music. Feeling patronized by her Republican opponent, Vice President George Bush, she publicly scolded him.
With Ms. Ferraro on the ticket, Democrats hoped to exploit a so-called gender gap between the parties. A Newsweek poll taken after she was nominated showed men favoring Reagan-Bush 58 percent to 36 percent but women supporting Mondale-Ferraro 49 percent to 41 percent.
For the first time, a major candidate for national office talked about abortion with the phrase "If I were pregnant," or about foreign policy with the personal observation "As the mother of a draft-age son...." She wore pearls and silk dresses and publicly worried that her slip was showing.
She also traveled a 55,000-mile campaign trail, spoke in 85 cities and raised $6 million. But in November the Democratic ticket won only one state -- Mr. Mondale's Minnesota -- and the District of Columbia.
And to the Democrats' chagrin, Mr. Reagan captured even the women's vote, drawing some 55 percent; women, it appeared, had opposed, almost as much as men, the tax increase that Mr. Mondale, a former senator and vice president under Jimmy Carter, had said in his acceptance speech would be inevitable, an attempt at straight talking that cost him dearly at the polls.
Most election analysts believed that from the start the Democratic ticket had little chance against a popular incumbent who was basking in an economic recovery and proclaiming that it was "morning again in America." Some said the choice of the little-known Ms. Ferraro had been a desperate move to attract the female vote in a daunting election year. Compounding the campaign's woes was a barrage of questions about the Ferraro family finances -- often carrying insinuations about ties to organized crime -- that not only blemished Ms. Ferraro's stature as the first Italian-American national candidate but also diverted attention from other issues.
Ms. Ferraro's politics teetered from liberal positions, like her support for the Equal Rights Amendment for women and a nuclear freeze, to conservative ones, like her opposition to school busing and her support of tax credits for private and parochial school parents. In her first race for the House of Representatives, in 1978, from New York's Ninth Congressional District in Queens, a Republican stronghold, her slogan was "Finally, a tough Democrat."
The abortion issue, magnified because she was Roman Catholic and a woman, plagued her campaign. Though she opposed the procedure personally, she said, others had the right to choose for themselves. Abortion opponents hounded her at almost every stop with an intensity seldom experienced by male politicians.
Writing in The Washington Post in September 1984, the columnist Mary McGrory quoted an unnamed Roman Catholic priest as saying, "When the nuns in the fifth grade told Geraldine she would have to die for her faith, she didn't know it would be this way."
Named for a Brother
Geraldine Anne Ferraro was born on Aug. 26, 1935, in the Hudson River city of Newburgh, N.Y., where she was the fourth child and only daughter of Dominick Ferraro, an Italian immigrant who owned a restaurant and a five-and-dime store, and the former Antonetta L. Corrieri. One brother died shortly after birth, and another, Gerard, died in an automobile accident when he was 3, two years before Geraldine was born.
Geraldine was born at home; her mother, who had been holding Gerard at the time of the crash and who had washed and pressed his clothes for months after his death, would not go to the hospital for the delivery and leave the third brother, Carl, at home.
Geraldine was named for Gerard, but in her book "Framing a Life: A Family Memoir," written with Catherine Whitney, Ms. Ferraro said her mother had emphasized that she was not taking his place.
"Gerry is special," she quoted her mother as saying, "because she is a girl."
Unknown to Ms. Ferraro at the time, her father had repeated trouble with the state liquor authorities and ultimately lost his restaurant license. During the vice-presidential campaign, she learned by reading The New York Post that her father had been arrested on charges of running a numbers racket but had died of a heart attack the morning he was to appear in court. Her mother was arrested as an accomplice, but the charges were dropped after her husband's death, Ms. Ferraro wrote.
She called her father's death, which happened when she was 8, "a dividing line that runs through my life." In her grief, she said, she developed anemia.
Her mother soon sold the store and the family's house and moved to the South Bronx. With the proceeds from the sale of property in Italy that her husband had left her, she sent Geraldine to the Marymount School, a Catholic boarding school in Tarrytown, N.Y. She sent Carl to military school.
Ms. Ferraro's outstanding grades earned her a scholarship to Marymount College in Tarrytown, from which she transferred to the school's Manhattan branch. She commuted there from Queens, where her mother had moved by then. An English major, Ms. Ferraro was editor of the school newspaper and an athlete and won numerous honors before graduating in 1956. "Delights in the unexpected," the yearbook said.
After graduating, Ms. Ferraro got a job teaching in a public grade school in Queens. She later applied to Fordham Law School, where an admissions officer warned her that she might be taking a man's place. Admitted to its night school, she was one of two women in a class of 179 and received her law degree in 1960.
Ms. Ferraro and John Zaccaro, whose family was in the real estate business, were married on July 16, 1960, two days after she passed her bar exam. She was admitted to the New York State bar in 1961, and decided to keep her maiden name professionally to honor her mother. (She was admitted to the United States Supreme Court bar in 1978.)
For the first 13 years of her marriage, Ms. Ferraro devoted herself mainly to her growing family. Donna was born in 1962, John in 1964 and Laura in 1966. Ms. Ferraro did some legal work for her husband's business, worked pro bono for women in Family Court and dabbled in local politics. In 1970 she was elected president of the Queens County Women's Bar Association.
In 1973, after her cousin Nicholas Ferraro was elected Queens district attorney, she applied for and got a job as an assistant district attorney in charge of a special victims bureau, investigating rape, crimes against the elderly, and child and wife abuse.
The cases were so harrowing, she later wrote, that they caused her to develop an ulcer. And the crime-breeding societal conditions she saw, she said, planted the seeds of her liberalism.
Sights Set on Congress
One night, before he became governor of New York, Mario M. Cuomo gave Ms. Ferraro and her husband a ride home from a bar mitzvah. She told him she was thinking of running for public office. "What about Congress?" Mr. Cuomo asked.
Ms. Ferraro found her opportunity in 1978, when James J. Delaney, a Democratic congressman from a predominantly working-class district in Queens, announced his retirement. In a three-way Democratic primary for the seat, Ms. Ferraro won with 53 percent of the vote. In the general election campaign, a slugfest against a Republican assemblyman, Alfred A. DelliBovi, she won by 10 percentage points, helped by her law-and-order background.
In the House, Ms. Ferraro was assigned to unglamorous committees but used them to her advantage. On the Public Works and Transportation Committee, she successfully pushed for improved mass transit around La Guardia Airport.
Mr. O'Neill, the speaker, took an immediate liking to her, and in her three terms she voted mostly with her party's leadership. Liberal and labor groups gave her high ratings, though she was less adamant than many liberal Democrats about cutting military spending.
Ms. Ferraro was a co-sponsor of the Economic Equity Act, which was intended to accomplish many of the aims of the never-ratified Equal Rights Amendment. She also supported federal financing for abortions.
"She manages to be threatening on issues without being threatening personally," Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, told The Chicago Tribune in 1984.
Others were less laudatory. "Some see her as too compromising, too ambitious, too close to the leadership," The Washington Post wrote that same year.
Her friendship with Mr. O'Neill helped her career. Thanks in part to him, she was elected secretary of the Democratic caucus, giving her influence on committee assignments, and in 1983 she was awarded a seat on the powerful budget committee, where she received a crash course in economics. To enhance her foreign policy credentials, she took trips to Central America and the Middle East.
It was Ms. Ferraro's appointment as chairwoman of the 1984 Democratic Platform Committee that gave her the most prominence. In her book "Ferraro: My Story," written with Linda Bird Francke, she said that in becoming the first woman to hold that post she owed much to a group of Democratic women -- Congressional staffers, abortion rights activists, labor leaders and others -- who called themselves Team A and who lobbied for her appointment.
Even before then, however, Ms. Ferraro's name had been mentioned on lists of potential candidates for vice president, along with Representative Patricia Schroeder of Colorado, the former congresswoman Barbara Jordan and Dianne Feinstein, the mayor of San Francisco. By May 1984, Mr. O'Neill had endorsed her for the No. 2 spot on the ticket. It was, as Ms. Ferraro later put it, "the Good Housekeeping seal of approval."
On July 1, the National Organization for Women threatened a convention floor fight if the Democrats did not choose a woman, and three days later a delegation of Democratic women went to Minnesota to urge Mr. Mondale to do so.
Mr. Mondale made his historic call, asking Ms. Ferraro to be his running mate, on July 11. His campaign believed that she would do well not only among women but also among blue-collar workers. Eight days later, wearing a white dress she had bought on Orchard Street on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, she accepted the Democratic nomination for vice president.
Trouble Over Finances
Her campaign was soon stalled by accusations about her personal finances. The storm reached its height in a two-hour press conference on Aug. 21, after Ms. Ferraro had released the tax returns of her husband, Mr. Zaccaro. She responded to question after question in a confident, relaxed manner. Mr. Cuomo called it "one of the best performances I've ever seen by a politician under pressure."
Ms. Ferraro later faced down hecklers in Texas and pro-Reagan auto workers in Illinois. After Vice President Bush was overheard bragging that "we tried to kick a little ass last night," referring to a debate with Ms. Ferraro, she declined to comment directly, though her aides called the remark insulting and demeaning. There were signs at campaign rallies saying, "Give 'em hell, Gerry!"
Everywhere people were adjusting -- or manifestly not adjusting -- to a woman on a national ticket. Mississippi's agriculture secretary called Ms. Ferraro "young lady" and asked if she could bake blueberry muffins. When a Roman Catholic bishop gave a news conference in Pennsylvania, he repeatedly referred to the Republican vice-presidential nominee as "Mr. Bush" and to the Democratic one as "Geraldine."
Ms. Ferraro's words raised hackles as well. She was criticized for suggesting that Reagan was not a "good Christian" because, she said, his policies hurt the disadvantaged.
Her inability to escape questions about her finances was partly brought on by her husband's initial refusal to release his tax returns. She riled Italian-Americans when she explained, "If you're married to an Italian man, you know what it's like."
When her financial situation was finally disclosed, it turned out that the candidate with the rags-to-riches story had a net worth approaching $4 million, a boat, a full-time uniformed maid and vacation homes on Fire Island in New York and in the Virgin Islands.
Mr. Bush's wife, Barbara, complained that Ms. Ferraro was masquerading as a working-class wife and mother, calling her a "four-million-dollar -- I can't say it, but it rhymes with rich."
Her associations and finances revealed one questionable thing after another. The Federal Election Commission fined her 1978 campaign committee for accepting $134,000 in contributions from her husband and children when they were legally allowed to contribute only $4,000.
Evidence also emerged that organized-crime figures had contributed to her campaigns. When a House ethics panel investigated her financial disclosures, it came out that one of Mr. Zaccaro's companies had rented two floors of a building to a pornography distributor.
The disclosures damaged a campaign that was already fighting an uphill battle; Mr. Mondale later said he thought they cost the campaign 15 percentage points in the polls. He also suggested that a male running mate might not have been dissected so severely. After the election, the House ethics committee determined that Ms. Ferraro's financial disclosures had been inadequate. In 1986, the elections commission said one of her campaign committees had improperly allocated funds.
Ms. Ferraro's family experienced legal problems of its own. In 1985, Mr. Zaccaro pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge that he had schemed to defraud a mortgage broker. Two years later he was acquitted of attempted extortion in a cable television company's bid to get a Queens franchise. And in 1988 the couple's son, John Jr., was convicted of a felony for selling cocaine in Vermont while a student at Middlebury College.
After her defeat in 1984, Ms. Ferraro was criticized for appearing in a Diet Pepsi commercial. Feminists in particular called it undignified.
She is survived by her husband, three children and eight grandchildren.
Later Bids for Office
Weary of the spotlight on her family, Ms. Ferraro passed up a chance to challenge Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, in his bid for a second term in 1986. But she decided to seek the seat in 1992 and entered the Democratic primary. She finished 10,000 votes (1 percent of the total) behind Robert Abrams, the state attorney general, who lost to Mr. D'Amato in the general election. She again ran for the Senate in 1998 but lost to Charles E. Schumer in the Democratic primary by a lopsided margin.
Ms. Ferraro was later ambassador to the United Nations Human Rights Commission during the Clinton administration and co-host of the CNN program "Crossfire" from 1996 to 1998. She also wrote books and articles and did business consulting.
Near the end of 1998, she learned she had multiple myeloma, a bone-marrow cancer that suppresses the immune system. She was one of the first cancer patients to be treated with thalidomide, a drug used in the 1960s to treat morning sickness that caused severe defects in unborn children.
"Such a strange thing," Ms. Ferraro said in an interview with The New York Times in 2001. "What was terrible for a healthy fetus has been wonderful at defeating the cancer cells."
She addressed her place in history in a long letter to The Times in 1988, noting that women wrote to her about how she had inspired them to take on challenges, "always adding a version of 'I decided if you could do it, I can too.' " Schoolgirls, she said, told her they hoped to be president someday and needed advice.
"I am the first to admit that were I not a woman, I would not have been the vice-presidential nominee," she wrote. But she insisted that her presence on the ticket had translated into votes that the ticket might otherwise have not received.
In any event, she said, the political realities of 1984 had made it all but impossible for the Democrats to win, no matter the candidates or their gender. "Throwing Ronald Reagan out of office at the height of his popularity, with inflation and interest rates down, the economy moving and the country at peace, would have required God on the ticket," Ms. Ferraro wrote, "and She was not available!"

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A picture caption last Sunday with an obituary about Geraldine A. Ferraro, the first woman from a major party to be nominated for vice president in American history, misstated, in some editions, the result of Ms. Ferraro's 1992 race for United States Senate from New York. She lost the Democratic primary to the state attorney general, Robert Abrams, by a margin of 1 percent of the vote; she did not get only 1 percent of the vote.

Abstract: Representative Darrell Issa, the California Republican, has proposed a bill in the House that would effectively cut the minimum wage in states where it was higher than the federal threshold by allowing employers to count health benefits toward wages.

Full text: As the nation grapples with a jobs crisis and unemployment hovers near 9 percent, it is easy for policy makers to forget the plight of those who work but earn very little. There are about 4.4 million workers earning the minimum wage or less, according to government statistics. This amounts to about 6 percent of workers paid by the hour. They need a raise.
Today, a worker laboring 40 hours a week nonstop throughout the year for the federal minimum wage could barely keep a family of two above the federal poverty line. Though it rose to $7.25 an hour in 2009, up $2.10 since 2006, the minimum wage is still lower than it was 30 years ago, after accounting for inflation. It amounts to about $1.50 an hour less, in today's money, than it did in 1968, when Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy were killed, Richard Nixon was elected president and the economy was less than a third of its present size.
The minimum wage has many opponents among big business and Congressional Republicans. In Nevada, the Las Vegas Chamber of Commerce is pushing to repeal the state's minimum wage, a whopping $8.25 an hour. Representative Darrell Issa, the California Republican, has proposed a bill in the House that would effectively cut the minimum wage in states where it was higher than the federal threshold by allowing employers to count health benefits toward wages.
Opponents argue that raising the minimum wage would inevitably lead to higher unemployment, prompting companies to cut jobs and decamp to cheaper labor markets. It is particularly bad, the argument goes, to raise it in a weak labor market. Yet with unemployment likely to remain painfully high for years to come, this argument amounts to a promise that the working poor will remain poor for a long time.
What's more, we know now that the argument is grossly overstated. Over the past 15 years, states and cities around the country have rushed ahead of the federal government to impose higher minimum wages. Economists analyzing the impact of the increases on jobs have concluded that moderate increases have no discernible impact on joblessness. Employers did not rush off to cheaper labor markets in the suburbs or across state lines for a simple reason: that costs money too.
The most recent research, by John Schmitt and David Rosnick at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, found that San Francisco's minimum wage jump to $8.50 in 2004 -- well above the state minimum of $6.75 -- improved low-wage workers' incomes and did not kill jobs. An even bigger jump in Santa Fe, N.M., the same year -- from $5.15 to $8.50 -- had a similar effect.
Despite evidence to the contrary, businesses and Republicans may keep pushing against the minimum wage -- using the jobs crisis now to clinch their argument. They should be disregarded, because their argument is wrong and the United States is too rich to tolerate such an underclass.

Consumer Spending Rises 0.7%; Inflation Edges Up 0.2%

Full text: WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- Consumer spending rose for an eighth consecutive month in February as households faced higher food and energy prices.
Spending rose 0.7 percent in February after a 0.3 percent increase in January, and inflation accelerated at its fastest rate since June 2009, the Commerce Department said on Monday.
Adjusted for inflation, consumer spending was up 0.3 percent last month after being flat the previous month.
"The data provide yet more evidence that higher prices are denting economic growth," said Paul Dales, a senior United States economist at Capital Economics in Toronto.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected spending to advance 0.6 percent.
Another report showed that pending sales of previously owned homes unexpectedly rose in February. The National Association of Realtors said its pending home sales index, based on contracts signed in February, increased 2.1 percent, to 90.8, after declining for the last two months.
Economists had expected a 1 percent decline after a previously reported 2.8 percent decline. Compared to February 2010, the index was down 8.2 percent.
After increasing at its fastest rate in four years in the final three months of 2010, consumer spending is expected to slow in the first quarter, with rising energy and food prices stealing from spending on other items.
High food and energy prices pushed up overall inflation last month. The Commerce Department said the personal consumption expenditures price index rose 0.4 percent, the fastest since June 2009, after gaining 0.3 percent in January
Excluding food and energy -- a core measure of inflation that is closely watched by the Federal Reserve -- the index increased 0.2 percent after rising by the same margin in January.
Incomes rose 0.3 percent last month after rising 1.2 percent in January. Economists had expected a 0.4 percent gain.

Cloudy Corporate Outlook Sends Shares Down

Full text: Stocks fell on Monday as the corporate outlook was clouded ahead of earnings and uncertainty from abroad remained a concern, while volume hit its lowest level of the year.
A warning from the hotel operator Marriott International hurt hotel and other consumer shares amid expectations of other negative corporate earnings preannouncements.
"Corporations now have several excuses that seem to resonate on Wall Street, from bad weather in January to the Middle East to the Japanese earthquake impacting the supply chain or sentiment," said Adam Parker, chief United States equity strategist at Morgan Stanley, in a client note.
Shares of Marriott International fell 6.3 percent to $35.30.
Stocks spent most of the day in positive territory, with the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index hitting a session high near 1,320 for a second consecutive session, driven by strength in the telecommunications sector and consumer spending data.
Japan's natural disasters and nuclear crisis along with civil unrest in the Middle East and Libya have increased market volatility in recent weeks.
The Dow Jones industrial average lost 22.71 points, or 0.19 percent, to 12,197.88. The S.& P. 500-stock index fell 3.61 points, or 0.27 percent, to 1,310.19. The Nasdaq composite index fell 12.38 points, or 0.45 percent, to 2,730.68.
The S.& P. telecom index rose 1.4 percent after a brokerage upgraded a number of companies, including Dow components AT&T and Verizon Communications. AT&T rose 1.8 percent to $29.36 and Verizon gained 1.2 percent to $37.75, curbing losses in the blue-chip index.
About 5.9 billion shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange, N.Y.S.E. Amex and Nasdaq, the lowest volume in 2011. Last Tuesday's 6.54 billion was the lowest until Monday.
"From the point of view of a purchaser, to make a commitment here, you have to think margins will keep expanding and the Fed will stay easing," said Subodh Kumar, chief investment strategist at Subodh Kumar and Associates in Toronto.
He said light volumes reflected investor uncertainty on those issues.
United States consumer spending rose slightly more than forecast in February, while inflation accelerated at its fastest rate since June 2009.
Eastman Kodak, up 5.3 percent at $3.58, was the N.Y.S.E.'s third-most active stock after a United States trade panel agreed last week to review a case that could bring the struggling photography company hundreds of millions of dollars in royalties.
EBay plans to buy a service provider for online commerce, GSI Commerce for nearly $2 billion to build up its online marketplaces as it intensifies its battle with Amazon.com.
GSI shares surged 50.7 percent to $29.20 in Nasdaq trading, while eBay shares lost 4.3 percent to $30.34 and Amazon slid nearly 1 percent to $169.35.
The situation in Japan remained a concern as water contaminated with radioactivity had leaked from a reactor at Japan's crippled nuclear complex, the plant's operator said. The environmental group Greenpeace said it had detected high levels of radiation outside an exclusion zone, adding to problems in Japan's battle to contain the world's worst atomic crisis since Chernobyl.
Interest rates were steady. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 1/32, to 101 18/32, and the yield was unchanged at 3.44 percent.

Housing Prices Slide for a Sixth Month

Abstract: The Conference Board reported Tuesday that its consumer confidence index tumbled 8.6 percent in March, the first drop in six months and the largest in a year. Lenders, who are wrangling with policy makers over reforms, placed 21 percent fewer homeowners in foreclosure in January than they did in November, even as the number of loans in severe default was holding steady, according to data released Tuesday by LPS Applied Analytics.

Full text: The housing market remains mired in trouble, with plummeting prices and slumping sales. First-time buyers are fleeing, sellers are frustrated, builders are depressed and lenders are skittish about making new loans.
"The numbers are gloomy, no question," said the economist Karl E. Case. "We're bouncing along a rocky bottom."
And that, he said, is the optimistic view.
"Others think we're falling off another cliff," Mr. Case said.
Housing prices slid in January for the sixth consecutive month, putting them barely above the lows reached in the depths of the recession two years ago, according to the index that Mr. Case helped develop.
The Standard & Poor's Case-Shiller Home Price Index for 20 large cities declined 1 percent from December, putting the slide from its 2006 peak at 31.8 percent, according to data released Tuesday.
Eleven cities hit a new low for the downturn, including Charlotte, N.C., Miami, Tampa, Fla., and New York. Prices in New York have fallen 23 percent from their peak.
Analysts expected a rough winter, but not quite so brutal. "We are more negative on housing than we were three months ago," said Jennifer Lee, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets. Any recovery will be delayed from this fall until next year, she said.
Buying a house is a mix of faith and necessity, but that first element is scarce these days. The Conference Board reported Tuesday that its consumer confidence index tumbled 8.6 percent in March, the first drop in six months and the largest in a year. Only 15 percent of respondents thought their incomes would increase over the next six months.
Among the troubles facing the market is a pervasive sense that houses are a bad bet. If prices still have further to fall, if loans are tough to get, if interest rates are no longer plunging, why not put off a deal if you possibly can?
Yet as Mr. Case suggested, things could be worse. The market is not falling at nearly the rate it was in 2008. All but the gloomiest analysts think the market is much closer to the end of the process than the beginning.
An element that is paradoxically working to shore up the market is the millions of foreclosed houses that are not coming back for sale and contributing to the abundance of inventory. Too much inventory pushes down prices.
Lenders, who are wrangling with policy makers over reforms, placed 21 percent fewer homeowners in foreclosure in January than they did in November, even as the number of loans in severe default was holding steady, according to data released Tuesday by LPS Applied Analytics.
One reason for fewer foreclosures is that more struggling borrowers appear to be making deals with their banks. The percent of severely delinquent loans returning to paid-up status rose to 22 percent from 10 percent over the last year, LPS said.
For many of the rest, foreclosure is less a process than a destination, the data indicates. Three out of 10 homeowners in foreclosure have not made any payment in at least two years.
Case-Shiller is a three-month moving average, which means it is resistant to quick changes. On a seasonally adjusted basis, January's drop was 0.2 percent, the same as in December. In the slower winter months, the adjusted numbers are considered less indicative of the market's true condition.
Prices were down 3.1 percent from their levels a year earlier. Only two of the 20 cities in the index recorded price increases during that time: Washington and, barely, San Diego.
First-time buyers, a critical force in the market, have become scarcer since a stimulus program involving tax credits came to an end last spring.
"That really motivated a lot of people to act," said Steven Thoele, a broker with Keller Williams Realty in Portland, Ore. "Eight grand in your pocket went a long way to making the numbers work."
Portland reached another low for the current downturn in January. Prices there fell 1.8 percent from December. They are now down 27 percent from their 2007 peak.
"You do kind of wonder where the bottom is," said Mr. Thoele. "Sellers know in the back of their mind that their home is worth less than at the peak, but they're still a little surprised when you tell them their $400,000 house is now worth $300,000."
Atlanta, Cleveland, Detroit and Las Vegas are now below their average prices of 11 years ago, and Phoenix is nearly there. Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas and Minneapolis are not doing much better. After adjusting for inflation, the struggles in these cities are even more pronounced.
The Case-Shiller release capped a run of weak housing reports. Existing-home sales were down in February by nearly 10 percent from January, the National Association of Realtors reported last week, much worse than expected.
New-home sales in February were 14 percent below forecasts, according to the Census Bureau. At an annual rate of 250,000, sales were the lowest since the advent of comprehensive record-keeping in 1963.
In one hopeful note, the National Association of Realtors said this week that pending home sales rose 2.1 percent in February. Those deals, which will become final in March and April, indicate that sales are unlikely to continue to tumble, which could help stabilize prices.
"The spring market could have some good surprises," said Mr. Case, the economist.
"I say that with absolutely no conviction."

As Economy Sputters, A Timid Fed

Abstract: [...] a prominent research firm founded by a former Fed governor, Macroeconomic Advisers, has downgraded its estimate of economic growth in the current quarter to a paltry 2.3 percent, from 4 percent. (Overall inflation obviously matters more for household budgets, but core inflation matters more to the Fed, because it's a better predictor of future inflation than inflation itself.) Over the last three months, the Fed's preferred measure of core inflation has risen at annual rate of 1.4 percent, up from less than 1 percent last year.

Full text: WASHINGTON
Whenever officials at the Federal Reserve confront a big decision, they have to weigh two competing risks. Are they doing too much to speed up economic growth and touching off inflation? Or are they doing too little and allowing unemployment to stay high?
It's clear which way the Fed has erred recently. It has done too little. It stopped trying to bring down long-term interest rates early last year under the wishful assumption that a recovery had taken hold, only to be forced to reverse course by the end of year.
Given this recent history, you might think Fed officials would now be doing everything possible to ensure a solid recovery. But they're not. Once again, many of them are worried that the Fed is doing too much. And once again, the odds are rising that it's doing too little.
Higher oil prices, government layoffs, Japan's devastation and Europe's debt woes are all working against the recovery. Already, a prominent research firm founded by a former Fed governor, Macroeconomic Advisers, has downgraded its estimate of economic growth in the current quarter to a paltry 2.3 percent, from 4 percent. The Fed's own forecasts, notes that former governor, Laurence Meyer, "have been incredibly optimistic."
Why is this happening? Above all, blame our unbalanced approach to monetary policy.
One group of Fed officials and watchers worries constantly about the prospect of rising inflation, no matter what the economy is doing. Some of them are haunted by the inflation of the 1970s and worry it may return at any time. Others spend much of their time with bank executives or big investors, who generally have more to lose from high inflation than from high unemployment.
There is no equivalent group -- at least not one as influential -- that obsesses over unemployment. Instead, the other side of the debate tends to be dominated by moderates, like Ben Bernanke, the Fed chairman, and Mr. Meyer, who sometimes worry about inflation and sometimes about unemployment.
The result is a bias that can distort the Fed's decision-making. Just look at the last 18 months. Again and again, the inflation worriers, who are known as hawks, warned of an overheated economy. In one speech, a regional Fed president even raised the specter of Weimar Germany.
These warnings helped bring an end early last year to the Fed's attempts to reduce long-term interest rates -- even though the Fed's own economic models said that it should be doing much more. We now know, of course, that the models were right and the hawks were wrong. Recoveries from financial crises are usually slow and uneven. Yet the hawks show no sign of grappling with their failed predictions.
It is true that the situation has become more complicated in the last couple of months. Some of the economic data has been encouraging, and inflation has picked up.
In particular, core inflation, which excludes volatile oil and food prices, has increased somewhat. (Overall inflation obviously matters more for household budgets, but core inflation matters more to the Fed, because it's a better predictor of future inflation than inflation itself.) Over the last three months, the Fed's preferred measure of core inflation has risen at annual rate of 1.4 percent, up from less than 1 percent last year.
Still, 1.4 percent remains low -- considerably lower than the past decade's average of 1.9 percent, the 1990s average of 2.2 percent or the 1980s average of 4.6 percent. Unemployment, on the other hand, remains high. By any standard, joblessness is a bigger problem than inflation.
There is also reason to think that inflation will fall in coming months. Rising oil prices alone aren't enough to create an inflationary spiral. Workers also need to have enough leverage to demand substantial raises -- which then forces companies to increase prices and, in turn, gives workers further reason to demand raises. In today's economy, this chain of events is pretty hard to fathom.
Adam Posen, an American economist who's now an official at the Bank of England, told The Guardian this week that he was so confident inflation in Britain would decline that he would resign if it did not. His analysis also applies to the United States. "Wages," Mr. Posen said, "will be the dog that doesn't bark."
It's still too soon to know what the Fed should do next. Its current plan is to let the program known as QE2 -- for quantitative easing, round two -- expire in June. The program started late last year, once the economy's troubles were impossible to ignore, as an attempt to reduce long-term interest rates by buying Treasury bonds.
If the economic data improves and inflation does not drop, ending QE2 will be the right call. But if the economy continues to weaken, there will be a strong case for doing more. One option would be to buy both Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed bonds, as the Fed did during QE1, as a way to attack the double dip in the housing market.
The problem is that some Fed officials already seem to have made up their minds, regardless of the data. In their public remarks, officials continue to wring their hands about QE2 rather than prepare people for the possibility of QE3. Some hawks have gone so far as to suggest halting QE2 early.
Meanwhile, the recovery looks uncertain, and the job market remains weak. Even if job growth were to accelerate sharply in coming months, the economy would be years away from so-called full employment. But never mind that, the hawks say -- rampant inflation is just around the corner.

Full text: NANJING, China -- Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner urged China again on Thursday to adopt a more flexible exchange rate policy, saying failing to do so could worsen inflation in China and impede growth in other parts of the world.
In a speech here, Mr. Geithner never mentioned China's currency, the renminbi. But he made clear that Beijing's strict control over the value of its currency was at odds with flexible exchange rates in other major economies. He said the issue had become "the most important problem to solve in the international monetary system today."
"It does not require a new treaty, or a new institution," he said. "It can be achieved by national actions to follow through on the work we have already begun in the G-20 to promote more balanced growth and address excessive imbalances."
Mr. Geithner's remarks were delivered during a one-day seminar on the international monetary system organized by President Nicholas Sarkozy of France, who is serving this year as head of the Group of 20 industrial and developed nations. The conference was hosted in Nanjing by a group of Chinese academics.
President Sarkozy has promised to use France's leadership of the G-20 to press for greater reform of the international monetary system.
The reforms he has begun to outline are largely aimed at addressing some of the most serious threats to global growth, including large trade imbalances, wildly fluctuating currency values and cross-border capital flows.
But those efforts will probably be hampered by fierce disagreement about how to proceed with reform and how to mediate continuing economic tensions between the United States and China.
While the United States wants China to overhaul its exchange rate policies and allow the renminbi to appreciate and move in line with market forces, China complains that the United States is damaging its interests by adopting loose fiscal and monetary policies.
The United States government, the Chinese argue, would like the Chinese to buy the country's bonds, but seems determined to weaken the dollar's long-term prospect by adopting loose monetary policies, thereby undermining the value of China's huge holdings of Treasury bonds.
Other emerging-market countries are also worried about whether the dollar is facing a long-term decline, analysts say.
"The big issue is the dollar has to and should decline in value because the U.S. is running big deficits," said Eswar S. Prasad, a professor of economics at Cornell University and a conference participant. "And that frustrates China and other emerging market countries. They know they have to buy lots more U.S. Treasuries if they continue accumulating foreign exchange reserves. And the value of those dollar reserves will eventually fall."
Analysts say China also knows it has put itself in a difficult position by closely tying its currency to the dollar and by accumulating huge amounts of dollar-denominated foreign exchange reserves.
At Thursday's seminar, however, Beijing seemed reluctant to discuss its own currency policies. Even before the seminar began, Beijing did its best to play down the importance of the meeting by insisting that discussion of the renminbi's value was not even on the agenda.
Delegates to the meeting said Chinese leaders were worried that the gathering could revive a longstanding debate about the slow pace of China's currency overhaul.
Some of China's top economic and financial planners, including Vice Prime Minister Wang Qishan and the head of China's Central Bank, Zhou Xiaochuan, attended the meetings Thursday. But participants said Chinese officials continued to insist on gradual changes rather than sharp moves that could shock the system.
President Sarkozy, however, seems to be looking for speedier efforts.
On Thursday, he said the international monetary system was already outdated and ineffective and said change was necessary to avoid "currency wars" or recurring financial crises.
In an impassioned address, President Sarkozy called for the International Monetary Fund to play a greater role in supervising the operations of the global monetary system. He also pressed for developing countries to have a greater role in the working of the international monetary system. He also said the I.M.F. should consider including the renminbi in its special drawing right, a kind of synthetic currency.
But like Mr. Geithner, Mr. Sarkozy also suggested that a crucial component in the reform would involve moving toward more flexible exchange rates, a proposal that seemed aimed at pressing China to speed up the pace of its overhaul.
"It is clear that we must evolve towards a more flexible exchange rate system that will allow us to withstand shocks," Mr. Sarkozy said in his address.
"But this flexible exchange system," he continued, "cannot evolve without rules, without coordination, without supervision, since instability would prevail. Without rules, the international monetary and financial system is incapable of forestalling crises, financial bubbles and the widening of imbalances."

Abstract: According to the report, a single worker needs an income of $30,012 a year -- or just above $14 an hour -- to cover basic expenses and save for retirement and emergencies.

Full text: Hard as it can be to land a job these days, getting one may not be nearly enough for basic economic security.
The Labor Department will release its monthly snapshot of the job market on Friday, and economists expect it to show that the nation's employers added about 190,000 jobs in March. With an unemployment rate that has been stubbornly stuck near 9 percent, those workers could be considered lucky.
But many of the jobs being added in retail, hospitality and home health care, to name a few categories, are unlikely to pay enough for workers to cover the cost of fundamentals like housing, utilities, food, health care, transportation and, in the case of working parents, child care.
A separate report being released Friday tries to go beyond traditional measurements like the poverty line and minimum wage to show what people need to earn to achieve a basic standard of living.
The study, commissioned by Wider Opportunities for Women, a nonprofit group, builds on an analysis the group and some state and local partners have been conducting since 1995 on how much income it takes to meet basic needs without relying on public subsidies. The new study aims to set thresholds for economic stability rather than mere survival, and takes into account saving for retirement and emergencies.
"We wanted to recognize that there was a cumulative impact that would affect one's lifelong economic security," said Joan A. Kuriansky, executive director of Wider Opportunities, whose report is called "The Basic Economic Security Tables for the United States." "And we've all seen how often we have emergencies that we are unprepared for," she said, especially during the recession. Layoffs or other health crises "can definitely begin to draw us into poverty."
According to the report, a single worker needs an income of $30,012 a year -- or just above $14 an hour -- to cover basic expenses and save for retirement and emergencies. That is close to three times the 2010 national poverty level of $10,830 for a single person, and nearly twice the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour.
A single worker with two young children needs an annual income of $57,756, or just over $27 an hour, to attain economic stability, and a family with two working parents and two young children needs to earn $67,920 a year, or about $16 an hour per worker.
That compares with the national poverty level of $22,050 for a family of four. The most recent data from the Census Bureau found that 14.3 percent of Americans were living below the poverty line in 2009.
Wider Opportunities and its consulting partners saw a need for an index that would indicate how much families need to earn if, for example, they want to save for their children's college education or for a down payment on a home.
"It's an index that asks how can a family have a little grasp at the middle class," said Michael Sherraden, director of the Center for Social Development at Washington University in St. Louis, who consulted on the project and helped develop projections for how much income families need to devote to savings. "If we're interested in families being able to be stable and not have their lives disrupted and have a little protection and backup and be able to educate their children, then this is the way we have to think."
The numbers will not come as a surprise to working families who are struggling. Tara, a medical biller who declined to give her last name, said that she earns $15 an hour, while her husband, who works in building maintenance, makes $11.50 an hour. The couple, who live in Jamaica, Queens, have three sons, aged 9, 8 and 6.
"We tried to cut back on a lot of things," she said. But the couple has been unable to make ends meet on their wages, and visit the River Fund food pantry in Richmond Hill every Saturday. With no money for savings, "I'm hoping that I will hit the lotto soon," she said.
To develop its income assessments, the report's authors examined government and other publicly available data to determine basic costs of living. For housing, which along with utilities is usually a family's largest expense, the authors came up with "a decent standard of shelter which is accessible to those with limited income" by averaging data from the Department of Housing and Urban Development that identified a monthly cost equivalent for rent at the fortieth percentile among all rents paid in each metropolitan area across the country.
They chose a "low cost" food plan from the nutritional guidelines of the Department of Agriculture, and calculated commuting costs "assuming the ownership of a small sedan." For health care, they calculated expenses for workers both with and without employer-based benefits.
Ms. Kuriansky said that the income projections do not take into account frills like gifts or meals out. "It's a very bare-bones budget," she said.
Obviously, the income needs change drastically depending on where a family lives. Ms. Kuriansky said the group was working on developing data for states and metropolitan areas.
The report compares its standards against national median incomes derived from the census, and finds that both single parents and workers who have only a high school diploma or only some college earn median wages that fall well below the amount needed to ensure economic security.
Workers who only finished high school have fared badly in the recession and the nascent recovery. According to an analysis of Labor Department data by Cliff Waldman, the economist at the Manufacturers Alliance, a trade group, the gap in unemployment rates more than doubled between those with just a high school diploma and those with at least a four-year college degree from the start of 2008 through February.
For some of the least educated, Mr. Waldman fears that even low wages are out of reach. "Given the needs of a more cognitive and more versatile labor force," he said, "I'm afraid that those that don't have the education are going to be part of a structural unemployment story."
Even for those who do get jobs, it may be hard to live without public services, say nonprofit groups that assist low-income workers. "Politicians are so worried about fraud and abuse," said Carol Goertzel, president of PathWays PA, a nonprofit that serves families in the Philadelphia region. "But they are not seeing the picture of families who are working but simply not making enough money to support their families, and need public support."
In New York, Aine Duggan, vice president for research, policy and education at the Food Bank for New York City, estimates that about a third of the group's clients are working but not earning enough to cover basic needs, much less saving for retirement or an emergency. She said that among households with children and annual incomes of less than $25,000, 83 percent of them would not be able to afford food within three months of losing the family income. That is up from 68 percent in 2008 at the height of the recession.
As the nation's employers add jobs, it is not yet clear how many of them are low wage jobs, especially those that do not come with benefits, like health care. Manufacturing, for example, has been relatively strong and tends to pay higher wages.
Over the last year, wages adjusted for inflation have been essentially flat. "If we were creating more low-paid jobs," said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics, "we would expect more of a decline in real wages."

Full text: A FEW years ago, the Federal Reserve remained complacent about inflation even as a housing bubble inflated. The Fed did not take the kind of action that would have seemed reasonable if it had been alarmed by rising prices.
Now the inflation rate is starting to turn up, and there are warnings that the Fed may need to tighten monetary policy even if the stumbling economic recovery does not accelerate. But home prices, which had seemed to be stabilizing a year ago, are falling again.
Until 1983, the Consumer Price Index included housing costs. But then the index was changed. No longer would home prices directly affect the index. Instead, the Bureau of Labor Statistics makes a calculation of "owners' equivalent rent," which is based on the trend of costs to rent a home, not to buy one. The current approach, the B.L.S. says, "measures the value of shelter to owner-occupants as the amount they forgo by not renting out their homes." The C.P.I. is not supposed to include investments, and owning a house has aspects of both investment and consumption.
Whatever the reasonableness of that approach, the practical effect of the change was to keep the housing bubble from affecting reported inflation rates in the years leading up to the peak in home prices. It is at least possible that the Federal Reserve would have acted differently had the change never been made.
The accompanying charts represent an effort to put together an alternate index of inflation, one that includes home prices rather than the owner's equivalent rate. The effort is far from precise, in large part because the old index was based not just on purchase prices but also on changing mortgage interest rates and on changing property taxes, while this one is based solely on an index of home prices. But it nonetheless gives an approximation of what inflation would have looked like had home prices remained in the index.
The effect is particularly notable in the core index, which excludes volatile energy and food prices, and which the Fed monitors closely. In 2004, when home prices were climbing at a rate of almost 10 percent a year -- more than four times the increase in rents -- the core index would have been over 5 percent had home prices been included. Instead, the reported core rate was just 2.2 percent.
The Fed did raise rates in 2004, although perhaps more slowly than seems appropriate in hindsight. The increases then stunned Wall Street, which might not have happened had investors been watching an inflation rate that included home prices.
In the last few months, the two markets have again diverged, but in the opposite way. From October 2010 through January, home prices as measured by an index kept by Federal Housing Finance Agency fell at an annual rate of 12.4 percent, while the government's calculation of owners' equivalent rent shows it rising at an annual rate of 1.5 percent. Home prices have not yet been reported for February, but the upward trend in rental prices continued.
Inflation rates may have been understated for years when home prices were rising much more rapidly than rental rates. At the time, the discrepancy might have seemed to be an indication of rising speculation and prompted Fed concern. Now, it is possible that inflation will be overstated precisely because speculative excesses are being purged from the housing market.

Abstract: Each year, an ever larger portion of the world's crops -- cassava and corn, sugar and palm oil -- is being diverted for biofuels as developed countries pass laws mandating greater use of nonfossil fuels and as emerging powerhouses like China seek new sources of energy to keep their cars and industries running. [...] with food prices rising sharply in recent months, many experts are calling on countries to scale back their headlong rush into green fuel development, arguing that the combination of ambitious biofuel targets and mediocre harvests of some crucial crops is contributing to high prices, hunger and political instability.

Full text: The starchy cassava root has long been an important ingredient in everything from tapioca pudding and ice cream to paper and animal feed.
But last year, 98 percent of cassava chips exported from Thailand, the world's largest cassava exporter, went to just one place and almost all for one purpose: to China to make biofuel. Driven by new demand, Thai exports of cassava chips have increased nearly fourfold since 2008, and the price of cassava has roughly doubled.
Each year, an ever larger portion of the world's crops -- cassava and corn, sugar and palm oil -- is being diverted for biofuels as developed countries pass laws mandating greater use of nonfossil fuels and as emerging powerhouses like China seek new sources of energy to keep their cars and industries running. Cassava is a relatively new entrant in the biofuel stream.
But with food prices rising sharply in recent months, many experts are calling on countries to scale back their headlong rush into green fuel development, arguing that the combination of ambitious biofuel targets and mediocre harvests of some crucial crops is contributing to high prices, hunger and political instability.
This year, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization reported that its index of food prices was the highest in its more than 20 years of existence. Prices rose 15 percent from October to January alone, potentially "throwing an additional 44 million people in low- and middle-income countries into poverty," the World Bank said.
Soaring food prices have caused riots or contributed to political turmoil in a host of poor countries in recent months, including Algeria, Egypt and Bangladesh, where palm oil, a common biofuel ingredient, provides crucial nutrition to a desperately poor populace. During the second half of 2010, the price of corn rose steeply -- 73 percent in the United States -- an increase that the United Nations World Food Programattributed in part to the greater use of American corn for bioethanol.
"The fact that cassava is being used for biofuel in China, rapeseed is being used in Europe, and sugar cane elsewhere is definitely creating a shift in demand curves," said Timothy D. Searchinger, a research scholar at Princeton University who studies the topic. "Biofuels are contributing to higher prices and tighter markets."
In the United States, Congress has mandated that biofuel use must reach 36 billion gallons annually by 2022. The European Union stipulates that 10 percent of transportation fuel must come from renewable sources like biofuel or wind power by 2020. Countries like China, India, Indonesia and Thailand have adopted biofuel targets as well.
To be sure, many factors help drive up the price of food, including bad weather that ruins crop yields and high oil prices that make transportation costly. Last year, for example, unusually severe weather destroyed wheat harvests in Russia, Australia and China, and an infestation of the mealy bug reduced Thailand's cassava output.
Olivier Dubois, a bioenergy expert at the Food and Agriculture Organization in Rome, said it was hard to quantify the extent to which the diversions for biofuels had driven up food prices.
"The problem is complex, so it is hard to come up with sweeping statements like biofuels are good or bad," he said. "But what is certain is that biofuels are playing a role. Is it 20 or 30 or 40 percent? That depends on your modeling."
While no one is suggesting that countries abandon biofuels, Mr. Dubois and other food experts suggest that they should revise their policies so that rigid fuel mandates can be suspended when food stocks get low or prices become too high.
"The policy really has to be food first," said Hans Timmer, director of the Development Prospects Group of the World Bank. "The problems occur when you set targets for biofuels irrespective of the prices of other commodities."
Mr. Timmer said that the recent rise in oil prices was likely to increase the demand for biofuels.
It can be tricky predicting how new demand from the biofuel sector will affect the supply and price of food. Sometimes, as with corn or cassava, direct competition between purchasers drives up the prices of biofuel ingredients. In other instances, shortages and price inflation occur because farmers who formerly grew crops like vegetables for consumption plant different crops that can be used for fuel.
China learned this the hard way nearly a decade ago when it set out to make bioethanol from corn, only to discover that the plan caused alarming shortages and a rise in food prices. In 2007 the government banned the use of grains to make biofuel.
Chinese scientists then perfected the process of making fuel from cassava, a root that yielded good energy returns, leading to the opening of the first commercial cassava ethanol plant several years ago.
"They're moving very aggressively in this new direction; cassava seems to be the go-to crop," said Greg Harris, an analyst with Commodore Research and Consultancy in New York who has studied the trade.
In addition to expanding cassava cultivation at home, China is buying from Cambodia and Laos as well as Thailand.
Although a mainstay of diets in much of Africa, cassava is not central to Asian diets, even though the Chinese once called it "the underground food store" because it provided crucial backup nutrition in lean harvest years. So the Chinese reasoned that making fuel with cassava would not directly affect food prices or create food shortages, at least at home. The proportion of Chinese cassava going to ethanol leapt to 52 percent last year from 10 percent in 2008.
More distant or indirect impacts are considered to be likely, however. Because cassava chips have been commonly used as animal feed, new demand from the biofuels industry might affect the availability and cost of meat. In Southeast Asian countries where China is paying generously for stockpiles of cassava, farmers may be tempted to grow the crop instead of, for example, other vegetables or rice.
And if China turned to Africa as a source, one of that continent's staple food crops could be in jeopardy, although experts note that exporting cassava could also become a business opportunity.
"This is becoming a more valuable cash crop," Mr. Harris said. "The farmland is limited, so the more that is devoted to fuel, the less is devoted to food."
The Chinese demand for cassava could also dent planned biofuel production in poorer Asian nations: in the Philippines and Cambodia, developers were recently forced to suspend the construction of cassava bioethanol plants because the tuber had become too expensive.
Thailand's own nascent biofuel industry may have trouble getting the homegrown cassava it needs because it may not be able to match the prices offered by Chinese buyers, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization.
Biofuels development in wealthier nations has already proved to have a powerful effect on the prices and the cultivation of crops. Encouraged by national biofuel subsidies, nearly 40 percent of the corn grown in the United States now goes to make fuel, with prices of corn on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange rising 73 percent from June to December 2010.
Such price rises also have distant ripple effects, food security experts say. "How much does the price of corn in Chicago influence the price of corn in Rwanda? It turns out there is a correlation," said Marie Brill, senior policy analyst at ActionAid, an international development group. The price of corn in Rwanda rose 19 percent last year.
"For Americans it may mean a few extra cents for a box of cereal," she said. "But that kind of increase puts corn out of the range of impoverished people."
Higher prices also mean that groups like the World Food Program can buy less food to feed the world's hungry.
European biofuels developers are buying large tracts of what they call "marginal land" in Africa with the aim of cultivating biofuel crops, particularly the woody bush known as jatropha. Advocates say that promoting jatropha for biofuels production has little impact on food supplies. But some of that land is used by poor people for subsistence farming or for gathering food like wild nuts.
"We have to move away from the thinking that producing an energy crop doesn't compete with food," said Mr. Dubois of the Food and Agriculture Organization. "It almost inevitably does."

CHARTS: Diverting Food to Fuel: More than ever, grain is being used for biofuels rather than food consumption. This trend started to take off in 2004; by 2010, 6 percent of all grain went into making biofuels. The diversion is a contributing factor in rising food prices. (The grains factored in here include barley, corn, millet, mixed grains, oats, milled rice, rye, sorghum, wheat and durum wheat.)

Full text: IN a small office in San Francisco, electronic music blared as several programmers loomed over two computers. David Morin, the founder of Path, a social network start-up, gave the signal and the company's site and iPhone application went live.
Within three hours of its Nov. 15 introduction, the site had tens of thousands of visitors.
Since then, Path has walked away from takeover talks with Google for as much as $100 million, according to a person close to the company, and raised $11 million from 27 investors. More revealingly, Path has turned down more than that from at least that many investors.
"I was humbled by the level of interest -- we're trying to build something that is deeply meaningful," Mr. Morin said. "As long as I'm doing my best to lead, I want to keep going."
For every Facebook, Groupon or Zynga, known for its Farmville game, there are scores of lesser-known start-ups like Mr. Morin's that are raising millions in financing at steep valuations, turning computer programmers into paper millionaires overnight.
Part of the reason is supply and demand, as a wave of capital chases a limited supply of deals. But a more tectonic shift is at work in Silicon Valley. Investors are putting a significant premium on young, visionary entrepreneurs who grew up with the Internet and now seem best positioned to direct the future of the social and mobile Web. Generally in their mid-20s or early 30s, today's start-up founders are becoming more assertive in funding rounds, securing better terms and, in many cases, cashing out part of their investments well before an initial public offering.
"The resources available to founders, to create and control their company's destiny, have evolved in their favor," said Sean Parker, a former president of Facebook and a founder of Napster. "The job of being a founder and executing against a big vision of the future has gotten easier."
Last year Quora, a question-and-answer site, raised $11 million at an $86 million valuation months before its debut. In February, Uber, an on-demand car service that uses mobile phone apps, raised $11 million at a $60 million valuation. And Color, a photo-sharing application, raised an astounding $41 million in March, before it opened for business. The round was led by Sequoia Capital, a venture capital firm that once invested a more modest $12.5 million in Google, back in 1999.
"For the next-generation opportunities around the Internet and social networks, I believe the biggest opportunities will be driven by young founders who maintain their C.E.O. positions," said Jim Breyer, an early investor in Facebook and a partner at Accel Partners.
In the postrecession environment, young entrepreneurs are finding relatively easy access to capital, as venture capitalists open their wallets wider and a new crop of angel investors move in. Venture capital investments rose 19 percent, to $21.8 billion in 2010 -- the first annual increase since the downturn, according to the National Venture Capital Association. The number of angel investors, meanwhile, surged 22 percent to 727 last year, according to data from research firm CB Insights.
The founder of Uber, Travis Kalanick, says the boom in angel investing and the popularity of networking services, like Angel List, a site that matches entrepreneurs with investors, have made financing significantly more accessible.
"In 2001, you took the money you could scrape -- I would talk to 150 V.C.'s and maybe one of them was interested," Mr. Kalanick said. Today, Uber has more than a dozen investors and a long line of suitors.
At the same time, the cost to start a Web business has dropped precipitously, thanks in large part to the availability of low-cost cloud computing services. The mobile games company TinyCo, which recently raised $18 million, ran on a shoestring budget for two years before its first financing round. Its founders, Suleman Ali and Ian Spivey, said they scrimped their way to profitability, using free software services like Google applications, renting office space from other start-ups and paying freelancers for art. Mr. Morin, who fondly recalls stacking servers during Facebook's early days, says he operates Path through the cloud, with Amazon Web Services.
And so, with just a pinch of capital, a start-up can go live, rapidly build up a user base from the Web's vast population and validate its thesis in a short period of time.
"There's never been a company ever that has grown as fast as Groupon or Facebook, because no one could reach such a big audience so quickly," said Ben Horowitz, a co-founder of venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. "The ability to build a company that gets to $1 billion in revenues in less than two years is unprecedented."
The swell in resources coincides with a shift in attitude, as more Internet founders stay in the chief executive role with the support of their venture capital backers. That was not always the norm. The early generation of Web companies is littered with examples of founders who backed down from the day-to-day responsibilities as their companies took off. Less than two years after Yahoo's beginning, its founders Jerry Yang and David Filo hired Tim Koogle as chief executive. One year after eBay was founded, Pierre Omidyar hired Jeff Skoll to lead his company in 1996.
"In the past, a lot of the top venture capitalists thought founders were replaceable, or that they were best replaced," said Marc Andreessen, the founder of Netscape and venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. "It's been a huge education."
Mr. Breyer of Accel Partners recalled that when he first invested in Facebook, in 2005, several investors asked him who he thought should replace Mark Zuckerberg as chief executive. Today, those questions have largely receded, he said, as investors put a greater premium on the founder's vision.
"In 2004, 2005, we saw that social applications and social networks were becoming absolutely central to the Web," Mr. Breyer said. "The only founders who really understood the implications of how that would change, were founders who didn't grow up with the very first generation of Internet companies."
As these factors coalesced, a founder's bargaining position at the negotiating table has also improved. Several years after the dot-com bust, a wave of progressive financing terms started to gain traction in Silicon Valley, led in part by founders who were burned by past investors. Through the spread of these ideas via the Web and word-of-mouth, more founders are securing advantageous financing terms, including higher valuations and stronger board control.
Mr. Parker, who in 2004 was pushed out of Plaxo, a start-up he co-founded, says venture capitalists robbed him of his full equity stake. As the first president of Facebook, Mr. Parker tried to protect Mr. Zuckerberg's interests by laying a foundation that would make it very difficult for future investors to strip Mr. Zuckerberg of his equity or his control. In the company's first major round of financing, a $12.7 million effort led by Mr. Breyer and Accel Partners in 2005, Mr. Parker pushed for a high valuation (near $100 million) and created a board structure that would guarantee two board seats to Mr. Zuckerberg. When Mr. Parker resigned from Facebook later that year, he gave Mr. Zuckerberg control of his board seat as well.
Later, as a venture capitalist, Mr. Parker helped pioneer a new class of stock, called Founders Fund or FF shares, which made it easy for founders to sell their shares during funding rounds without jeopardizing the value of common shares.
"Up until Founders Fund came along, the general venture capital rule was that founders could not take money out until everyone else did; this changed the V.C. model quite a bit," said Don Dodge, a Google employee and an angel investor who invested in Mr. Morin's company.
Others in Silicon Valley also introduced and popularized pro-founder documents, including Ted Wang, a lawyer with Fenwick & West, who created standard deal documents for early (or seed) investments; and Adeo Ressi, who runs the Founder Institute, a start-up incubator. Mr. Ressi teamed up with Yoichiro Taku, a lawyer at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, to introduce "F" class shares, a class of stock that guarantees founders twice the number of voting shares held by other board members. At least 200 companies have used "F" class shares, according to Mr. Taku.
In this environment, investors like Yuri Milner, the founder of D.S.T. Global, have thrived. Mr. Milner, a Russian billionaire who is widely considered a founder-centric investor, has spearheaded giant capital fund-raising efforts at billion-dollar valuations for late-stage start-ups, like Facebook and Groupon.
Since his first major investment in the United States -- a minor stake in Facebook in 2009 -- Mr. Milner has poured hundreds of millions of dollars into American start-ups, often asking for no control, or even a board seat, in return. In many of the D.S.T. deals, founders and early investors have had the option to convert some of their stakes in the company to cash. As his fortunes grow, Mr. Milner, who recently paid $100 million for a mansion in Los Altos Hills, Calif., has put pressure on other venture capitalists to follow suit and offer similar terms.
"Yuri's visionary bets focused on exceptional founders," said Shervin Pishevar, an angel investor and co-founder of the Social Gaming Network. "Now, like a rubber band, we're chasing him."
As founders see their strength grow, analysts are wondering what implications this might have for Silicon Valley. On one hand, the new wave of start-ups could produce gains in innovation and the creation of game-changing companies akin to Google or Microsoft. Young entrepreneurs, flush with cash, say the surge in capital also gives them the freedom to build significant companies without distraction.
"By taking money off the table, you're expunging a big source of risk, allowing you to focus on the interests of the company you're building instead of your own," said Andrew Mason, the 30-year-old founder and chief executive of Groupon. He said he was able to sell some of his shares in D.S.T. Global's initial Groupon investment, a $135 million round last April.
But there are also concerns that the widespread enthusiasm has led to an inflation of company valuations and unrealistic expectations. At some point, many of these start-ups will probably falter and money will eventually become tighter. Mr. Dodge says the average valuation for young start-ups held at $1 million to $2 million for several years, but in the last two years, that range has more than tripled, to $5 million to $6 million.
"Investors are dropping checks in early-stage companies and giving it away like Halloween candy," said Mr. Taku, the Wilson Sonsini lawyer.
Matt Cohler, a general partner with Benchmark Capital and an early employee of Facebook and LinkedIn, is troubled for another reason. He's worried that the popularity of entrepreneurship will siphon talent away from the larger start-ups, businesses that could be the next Facebooks. As a generation races to the gold rush, rising start-ups will inevitably struggle to find an army of whiz-kid engineers.
"My fear is, what if all these talented people are too thinly spread among too many small-scale opportunities and it becomes too difficult to aggregate really talented people to solve important problems?" he said.
It's already a concern for Mr. Kalanick, the founder of Uber, who is looking for engineers at reasonable wages. As more talented prospects start their own companies or take lofty offers from the likes of Google or Apple, engineer salaries are soaring. He estimates that the salary for an engineer has jumped 25 percent in the last year.
Despite these worries, many in the Valley say they believe a new class of giants will emerge from the swarm of start-ups.
"In the next decade Groupon will not look like an anomaly; there may not be 50 $50 billion companies, but there's probably going to be 50 $1 billion companies," Mr. Pishevar, the angel investor, said.

Full text: FRANKFURT -- Defying critics and breaking ranks with its counterparts in the United States and Britain, the European Central Bank moved on Thursday to slay what some economists say they believe is an imaginary inflation threat, raising the benchmark interest rate in the euro area for the first time since 2008.
The bank's president, Jean-Claude Trichet, argued that the bank needed to attack inflation even though many economists contend that raising borrowing costs could damage weaker economies like that of Portugal, which on Wednesday became the third country in the euro zone to request a bailout.
With what sometimes sounded like contrarian pride, Mr. Trichet said the rate increase was perfectly in tune with economic growth.
"There is no contradiction, but full complementarity in doing what is our prime mandate, which is to deliver price stability," he said after a meeting of the bank's governing council. "We do what we have to do even when it is difficult, even when it is not necessarily pleasing everyone."
Asked what he would say to families in Ireland who will now have to make higher payments on their adjustable-rate mortgages, Mr. Trichet said low inflation "benefits all, including, of course, those who have the most difficulty at the present."
The increase in the benchmark policy rate to 1.25 percent from 1 percent puts the bank at odds with the Federal Reserve, which continues to stimulate the American economy, as well as the Bank of England, which on Thursday left its benchmark interest rate at 0.5 percent despite higher inflation.
The European bank's decision, which Mr. Trichet said was unanimous on the 23-member governing council, drew muted praise from places like Germany, where the rate increase could help prevent the economy from overheating. But the reaction from some quarters was scathing.
The rate increase could have dire consequences for Greece, Ireland and Portugal, where they are already having severe problems borrowing money at reasonable rates, some economists said. Portugal's caretaker government gave in to market pressures and asked for a bailout.
"Tighter monetary policy will only add to the burden of reeling peripheral countries and increase the risk of a much worse debt crisis," Marie Diron, a former central bank economist who advises the consulting firm Ernst & Young, said in a note Thursday. "We hope that this rate hike is not the start of a series of rate increases that would seriously endanger the fragile recovery."
Michael T. Darda, chief economist at MKM Partners, a research firm in Stamford, Conn., said the bank was repeating the mistake made by the Fed in the 1970s and 1980s, when it responded to higher oil prices by raising rates. Recessions followed.
"Those recessions were not oil-induced but Fed-induced," said Mr. Darda, citing an academic paper by Ben S. Bernanke, now the Fed chairman, that criticized Fed policy at the time.
Though interest rates are still historically low, they are high in relation to Europe's stuttering growth rate, Mr. Darda said.
"The ultimate effect is that they are going to restrain inflation in Germany and France but will cause deflation in the periphery, which will cause austerity programs to fail," Mr. Darda said. "This could very well spread into Spain and Italy."
Mr. Trichet said that a rate increase would hold down long-term borrowing costs, by giving lenders confidence that inflation would not erode their profits.
The Bank of England faces similar inflation concerns, but left its main policy rate alone after recent economic data painted a mixed picture of the strength of Britain's recovery. It also kept its bond-purchase plan at $:200 billion, or $325 billion.
Not all economists were so critical of the European bank move.
"Fear that this step by the E.C.B. will lead to a worsening of the crisis in the peripheral countries is overdone," Michael Heise, chief economist at the German insurer Allianz, said in a note to clients. Even if the E.C.B. raises the rate to 2 percent by the end of the year, real interest rates would still be lower than inflation, he said.
In light of strong German growth, the "rate decision was without doubt logical," Karl-Heinz Boos, executive director of the Association of German Public Sector Banks, said, though he added that the bank should be cautious about raising rates further.
And Mr. Trichet suggested that another rate increase soon was not a foregone conclusion. "We did not decide today that it was the first of a series of interest rate increases," he said. Analysts interpreted his remarks to mean that the bank might wait several months before raising rates again.
The central bank left open the question of how it would deal with banks in Ireland and other countries that have become dependent on central bank funding because they cannot borrow on the open market. Mr. Trichet said the governing council had not yet decided how to deal with the so-called addicted banks.
It is rare for the European bank to move against inflation before the Fed does. More than the Fed, the European bank is required by charter to make fighting inflation its priority.
The bank's resolve was probably strengthened by recent data. Inflation in the euro area rose at an annual rate of 2.6 percent in March, up from 2.2 percent in February and above the bank's target of just under 2 percent.
The European Central Bank last raised its benchmark rate to 4.25 percent from 4 percent in July 2008. The following October, as the financial crisis took hold, the bank reversed course and began a series of cuts that brought the benchmark rate to 1 percent in May 2009.
Rates in Britain also fell to a record low, but the Bank of England is likely to wait for more data at the end of this month before making any decision to lift interest rates, economists said.
Britain's central bank fears that raising interest rates too soon could damage an already weak economic recovery..

Full text: It's not just an estimated 800,000 federal employees who would feel the financial pinch of a government shutdown.
Among the people anxiously waiting to hear if Congress can reach a budget deal are front desk clerks at the Ahwahnee Hotel in Yosemite National Park, manufacturing executives whose companies supply goods to federal agencies, bank loan officers who make mortgages guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration and Wall Street analysts who depend on a steady flow of government data.
The federal government is, after all, a very big business, and temporarily pulling the plug would disrupt many other businesses.
President Obama has warned that the looming shutdown could stall the already fragile economic recovery by choking off much-needed paychecks to workers and introducing another level of uncertainty in an already uncertain world.
Economists are divided as to how much the shutdown would rattle the economy. Of course, some of it depends on how long any stoppage lasts. If Congress agrees to a budget quickly, it might be just a few national park visitors who are disappointed over the weekend. But if the hiatus stretches to a week -- or to nearly three weeks as it did in 1995 -- then the ripples could quickly fan out.
When the government shut down for 20 days in late 1995, the nation's economic growth was slowed by as much as a full percentage point in that quarter, according to James F. O'Sullivan, chief economist at MF Global. The effect was temporary, he said, with the economy adding about that much in the following quarter.
Mr. O'Sullivan said that over the three months that included the shutdown, federal spending fell 14.2 percent from the previous quarter, before rebounding 8.6 percent in the following quarter.
David Greenlaw, United States economist at Morgan Stanley, said other factors might have held back growth in late 1995, including a 10-week strike at Boeing. This time around, the economic expansion faces a number of challenges, including turmoil in the Middle East, concerns about supplies coming from Japan after its earthquake, tsunami and nuclear crisis, and millions of unemployed Americans looking for work.
The federal government is such a large customer that many companies, like Booz Allen or Verizon, could be forced to cut back on workers' hours, though these two companies and many others declined to comment on their plans on Thursday.
At the national parks, many of the hotels and restaurants are operated by private concerns that will most likely suspend some workers if the parks are closed. Without their weekly paychecks, those employees could tighten their belts, causing further fallout for grocery stores or other retailers who may see sales slow.
In Yosemite, for example, Delaware North Companies Parks and Resorts operates four hotels with 972 rooms and 13 restaurants. A company spokeswoman, Lisa Cesaro, said that if the shutdown continued beyond the weekend, all lodging and food operations would close, and workers would be forced to take vacation time or unpaid leave, right as peak season was starting.
Government contractors are worried not only about payments, but also about what to do with inventories they would normally ship to agencies that may be closed. Imagine a parts supplier for the federal government with a scheduled delivery coming up, said Rae Ann S. Johnson, a lawyer and council director for the Manufacturers Alliance/Mapi, a trade group. "If the government is shut down, there is no one to deliver it to. If they have to store it longer than anticipated, then there are extra costs."
The shutdown could also make it harder for lower-income families to get mortgage loans because the Federal Housing Administration would suspend its guarantee program. The F.H.A. guaranteed about 21 percent of new mortgage loans in 2010, federal data shows.
Shaun Donovan, the housing secretary, said on Thursday that he feared some lenders would stop making new F.H.A. loans, or prevent closings by reneging on loan approvals. "This is the worst time that we could introduce that uncertainty into this fragile housing market," Mr. Donovan told a Senate subcommittee.
Lenders do not need to obtain guarantees at the time a loan is made. Wells Fargo and Bank of America, by far the biggest F.H.A. lenders, said that they would continue to make the loans and simply wait to obtain guarantees -- at least as long as the shutdown remained fairly brief. But JPMorgan Chase said that it would not make new F.H.A. loans during a shutdown, although it emphasized that loans already approved would not be affected.
Economists as well as Wall Street analysts and investors fret that the spigot of data churned out by the government could stop if the shutdown extends into next week. Reports scheduled for next week include retail sales and inflation data.
A spokesman for the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which calculates the unemployment rate, said that during a shutdown, the agency would not collect data, issue reports or respond to public inquiries, adding that the Web site might not be operational and would not be updated.
"It could play a little havoc with the data and the markets," said Kathleen Bostjancic, director for macroeconomic analysis at the Conference Board. For now, she said, "I think the markets are taking it in stride because they believe it's going to be short term and we've been through this before. On the other hand, the markets don't like uncertainty, that's for sure."
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed down just 2.03 points -- or 0.15 percent -- at 1,333.51 on Thursday. But analysts said that the markets could be rattled if the shutdown dragged on, not so much because of the immediate effects, but because Congress's inability to reach an agreement would send a negative signal to investors looking for signs of confidence.
"There is almost no one in the private sector who can look at the shutdown and call it responsible in any form or fashion," said Allen Sinai, a founder of Decision Economics. If a company failed to come up with a budget, he said, "every executive would be fired by the board. The public and the world is pretty much at the end of its patience."
He said that the stock market would be at risk, and the dollar could slide further as foreign investors sought havens elsewhere. Others suggested that since the financial markets largely shrugged off recent turmoil in the Middle East and Japan, a government shutdown was unlikely to prompt a sell-off.
"I think it will probably do some knee-jerk damage to the stock market," said Nigel Gault, chief United States economist at IHS Global Insight, "but I think the most likely scenario is, if there is a shutdown, it won't last very long. And the stock market should have bigger things to worry about."
A far bigger concern, Mr. Gault said, was if a divided Congress would be able to agree on what to do about the debt ceiling, which will most likely be breached this summer if it is not raised.
"The question is, does it damage confidence in the government's ability to make decisions?" he said. "Or does it make people worry that maybe, if we get a shutdown now, maybe even if they can settle this one, down the road there could be a much, much worse problem on extending the debt limit."

Abstract: "If we had all sat down in January and predicted we'd have turmoil in the Middle East and Africa, a devastating tsunami in Japan, an earthquake in New Zealand, housing continuing to go down, oil over $100 a barrel and policy makers still fighting with each other, we might have been tempted to say that 1,400 for the S.& P. looked aggressive," Marc Stern, chief investment officer at Bessemer Trust, said of his year-end stock index prediction. Bill Stone, chief investment strategist at PNC Wealth, said he favored dividend-paying stocks in January but admitted that they performed better in February when the stock market lost some value than they did when the market was strong.

Full text: PREDICTING the future is a tough business, particularly when unexpected events make your crystal ball look more like a snow globe. But the group of strategists and advisers polled for this column in January are so far sticking to their forecasts that equities are poised for growth this year.
This is fairly remarkable given what the first quarter brought: natural disasters, serious problems at a Japanese nuclear reactor and revolution and unrest in the Middle East. That politicians in the United States are bickering along party lines, with the budget hanging in the balance, seems trivial by comparison.
"If we had all sat down in January and predicted we'd have turmoil in the Middle East and Africa, a devastating tsunami in Japan, an earthquake in New Zealand, housing continuing to go down, oil over $100 a barrel and policy makers still fighting with each other, we might have been tempted to say that 1,400 for the S.& P. looked aggressive," Marc Stern, chief investment officer at Bessemer Trust, said of his year-end stock index prediction. "But the market hung in there well because of corporate earnings."
Richard Madigan, chief investment officer for J.P. Morgan Private Bank's global access portfolios, was equally impressed with how the stock market weathered this spate of shocks. "It's staggering what we saw and how well behaved the market was," he said. "I don't believe the markets would have behaved as well as they had over the past three months if investors were fully invested."
That was the silver lining for those who analysts who made bullish calls. Many people were still hesitant to invest their cash despite predictions that the stock markets would rise steadily this year.
Back in January, Mr. Stern predicted as much, saying that stocks would have to rise more before most investors would buy equities again.
To one contrarian, waiting on equities is not a bad thing with the prospect of inflation still low. "Domestically, you don't have the source of factors to create inflation," said Richard Cookson, chief investment officer at Citi Private Bank. "You have broad monetary policy crawling along. You have a situation where unemployment or underemployment is extremely high. You don't have the ability for employees to gouge more from their employers."
So with the second quarter under way, let's see what our group sees for the rest of the year.
CONSENSUS The big debate when I spoke to this group in January was over whether the time was right to move money from bonds to stocks. With the exception of Mr. Cookson, the consensus was that it was.
Those beliefs are even firmer now. "It is important to point out that stocks have not been this cheap to bonds since 1980," said Niall Gannon, director of wealth management at the Gannon Group at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney. "We see a global equity strategy focused on where the earnings are produced."
To that end, he treats Japanese equities like American companies because the United States consumes so many Japanese products, while he considers Nike a non-American company because only 25 percent of its earnings come from sales here.
Some suggestions for variations on stocks have not fared as well.
Bill Stone, chief investment strategist at PNC Wealth, said he favored dividend-paying stocks in January but admitted that they performed better in February when the stock market lost some value than they did when the market was strong.
Still, he said he believed that Cisco Systems announcing its first dividend ever in March was a sign that such stocks could come back in vogue. "It's still a nice play in risk-reward terms," he said. "I think we're at the very beginning of the reallocation into equities, and that makes it attractive."
Mr. Stern said he continued to believe that convertible bonds were right for people who want more return but were still hesitant about putting a lot of money into equities. "If the stock went up 25 percent, the convertible bond could go up 12 to 15 percent," he said. "If the stock went down 25 percent, the convertible bond would roughly break even."
SURPRISES Beyond the earthquake and tsunami in Japan and the unrest in the Middle East, there were other unexpected changes.
On the positive side, the unemployment rate has dropped to 8.8 percent. Mr. Madigan had predicted that it would hover around 9 to 10 percent for the foreseeable future. "I'm thrilled that I was wrong," he said. But he said he did not think there would be real economic growth until employees were paid more.
The worries about a wave of municipal bond defaults seem to have been overdone -- or at least premature. Mr. Gannon said his group created a model with a 2 to 3 percent default rate for the year, but he now sees that as too high. And even if that default rate occurs, he said it would not have a huge impact on portfolios with higher-grade municipal bonds.
He noted that the rate at which investors recovered money from defaults of general obligation bonds has historically been high. Plus, he estimated that even with a few defaults, you would still do better than if you left your money in cash.
On the negative side, oil prices are far higher than anyone imagined because of the turmoil in the Middle East. Yet Mr. Cookson argued that higher oil prices were ultimately going to affect growth, not cause inflation.
"In the U.S., it's costing you 30 percent more to fill up your gas tank," he said. "If you can't get more money to offset that, it's a growth question, not an inflation question. People look in generic terms at inflation, but you can't look at it that way."
Mr. Cookson's one seeming error was to advocate buying Japanese equities. Of course, he could not have foreseen the events in Japan. But he said he remained just as bullish on Japan over the long term. "We went even more overweight," he said.
The one conundrum is the continuing rise in the price of gold. Mr. Stern had predicted it would drop in value, but except for a dip, it has continued to rise. "Even the gold bulls would acknowledge that they cannot tell you using pen and paper that it's going to be worth $1,486 on a particular day," he said. "It's a feeling that it is going higher." He still advocates cutting gold allocations.
NEW RISKS The rest of 2011 is certainly not clear sailing. Three areas concern these strategists: Saudi Arabian stability, Chinese inflation and politicians in the United States.
After the 30-year reign of Hosni Mubarak came to an end in Egypt, there is concern about the stability of the regime in Saudi Arabia. If that government fell, oil prices would rise stratospherically and send the economy into a global recession. "You can't put a risk rating on it," Mr. Cookson said. "People do, but it's a meaningless exercise."
Inflation in China seems to be more predictable. Mr. Stern noted that real estate development increased 35 percent last year from the previous year, a sign of a bubble. But he said he thought it was a good sign that Chinese policy makers raised interest rates this week.
As to the budget battle in Washington, "We're not interested in whether Republicans or Democrats win," Mr. Stern said. "We want some policies that restrain the debt level. We think grown-ups need to make grown-up decisions."
Whether the group's latest predictions will fare as well as their earlier ones is hard to say. We'll check in on them next quarter to see how they did.

Full text: IF investor behavior foreshadows what's in store for the economy several months down the road, inflation could be a bigger threat than government figures now suggest.
The current numbers paint a rather benign picture, as core inflation in the United States has been growing at a modest annual rate of 1.1 percent. Even when volatile food and energy prices are factored in, overall consumer prices rose just 2.1 percent over the year through February, the most recent period for which data are available.
Yet the market appears to be looking past this information. Since the end of December, investors have been pulling money out of mutual funds that invest in assets that fare poorly when inflation kicks up, like intermediate-term bonds and cash, according to an analysis of fund flows by Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch Global Equity Research.
At the same time, they've been pouring money into funds that invest in traditional inflation plays. Those include Treasury inflation-protected securities, commodities and, of course, stocks. Equity funds alone have drawn $30 billion in net inflows since the end of December, according to the Investment Company Institute, the fund industry trade group.
Of course, there is still a debate over whether these shifts make sense. Worrisome levels of inflation may not materialize at all. Economists at IHS Global Insight, for example, are forecasting that consumer prices will grow at only around 2 percent a year from 2012 through 2014. They say they believe that wage growth will be muted in a sluggish job recovery.
But some strategists are bracing for an inflation jump. Jason Hsu, chief investment officer at Research Affiliates, a consulting firm in Newport Beach, Calif., said he expected the numbers to rise in a little more than a year from now. "We're talking about inflation hovering in the 4 percent area," he said, with a risk of it moving even higher. He pointed to the flood of stimulus that's been pumped into the economy by governments throughout the world. Some central banks overseas have already reversed course and are raising rates to keep a lid on prices. The European Central Bank made such a move last week, citing worrisome levels of inflation in food and energy costs. Even if Mr. Hsu is right, though, there is still the question of how effective stocks will be in protecting portfolios amid rising consumer prices.
Historically, stocks have been regarded as a decent inflation hedge -- at least relative to bonds and cash -- because stock returns have outpaced inflation for most of the past century.
Yet it's not always the case. Ned Davis Research, based in Venice, Fla., recently analyzed how the market performed in different inflationary environments over the past four decades. While the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index posted double-digit gains, on average, when inflation has been between 1 percent and 4 percent, stocks fell at an annualized rate of 1.4 percent when inflation jumped to between 4 percent and 9 percent.
What's more, in periods when the inflation rate is accelerating, not all types of stocks perform the same way. Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at Standard & Poor's Equity Research, looked at periods since 1970 when the year-over-year change in the Consumer Price Index was accelerating. He found eight such sustained periods, and saw that half of the 10 market sectors, on average, gained ground during those times; the others declined or were flat.
Which types of equities are likely to outperform if inflation starts to heat up this time?
Mr. Hsu says he thinks large, domestically based multinational companies would look attractive if inflation really took off and the dollar continued to weaken against other major currencies. Although a weaker dollar would effectively raise the cost of goods imported from overseas, it would lower prices for exports, thus benefiting the American multinationals.
Another promising area is dividend-paying stocks, said Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones in St. Louis. Since 1947, payouts issued by the S.& P. 500 companies have grown at an annual rate of 5.6 percent, she said, outpacing the 3.7 percent inflation rate during the period.

BUT there is another reason to favor dividend payers, she said. Businesses that stand to thrive during inflationary periods are those that have the power to pass along price increases to their customers. And companies with growing dividends often have that ability. "When you think about it," she said, "companies that have pricing power -- and are thus able to maintain their profit margins -- will be able to continue to raise their dividends."
Brad Sorensen, director of market and sector analysis at Charles Schwab, said pricing power might be focused in certain sectors. Historically, "energy companies have proven they can raise prices pretty quickly at the pump if oil climbs," he said. "On the other end of the spectrum, consumer companies have a hard time passing along price increases on things like clothes because there's so much competition."
If inflation spikes, energy has proved to be a good place to hide. But if the discussion moves from rising inflation to hyperinflation, other defensive areas of the market like health care and utilities would seem to make sense, Mr. Stovall said. After all, no matter how expensive things become, people still need to see the doctor and turn on the lights.

Abstract: According to Morningstar, real estate funds returned 6.1 percent in the first quarter, compared with a 5.1 percent average gain for all stock funds.

Full text: THE housing market may be facing a prolonged dip in prices, but for real estate mutual funds the problem is very different: prices that have climbed so much that they may not be sustainable.
It may seem surprising, but while home sales have slumped and foreclosure rates have risen in recent months, real estate funds, which typically invest in commercial property and multifamily housing, have boomed.
The 251 domestic real estate funds tracked by Lipper have returned 55.7 percent over the past two years, on average, compared with 31.2 percent for diversified equity funds. According to Morningstar, real estate funds returned 6.1 percent in the first quarter, compared with a 5.1 percent average gain for all stock funds.
Real estate funds have been able to outperform the average general equity fund in part because they did so much worse in the most severe part of the downturn. During the heart of the financial crisis, some commercial real estate investments lost two-thirds of their value in less than six months. Some real estate funds ended 2008 with losses of more than 50 percent.
"It's been a huge snapback from a drop that was way overdone," said Robert W. Gadsden, manager of the $112 million Alpine Realty Income and Growth fund, which returned 9.24 percent in the quarter, making it the top-performing real estate fund among those tracked by Lipper.
Real estate funds tend to concentrate their investments in real estate investment trusts, or REITs, which own office, industrial, apartment, health care and other types of income-producing properties. REITs were one of the hardest-hit sectors when the credit markets seized in the fall of 2008, as investors feared that they wouldn't be able to refinance their debt and that a wave of corporate bankruptcies would cause vacancy rates in their office properties to soar. From Sept. 30, 2008, to March 6, 2009, the MSCI United States REIT index plummeted 66 percent. Mr. Gadsden's Alpine Realty fund ended 2008 down 50.2 percent, according to Bloomberg.
"There was extraordinary fear in the market, and people did not see the positives, like the diversification in REIT portfolios as well as their long leases and long debt agreements," said Mr. Gadsden, whose recent top holdings have included REITs like the Simon Property Group, the mall owner, and Vornado Realty Trust, the big office landlord.
As REITs began to regain access to the credit markets, however, that fear began to dissipate, prompting a relief rally that has been supported by an almost perfect mix of market conditions, fund managers say. Those conditions have included very low interest rates, depressed property prices, lots of available capital and a lack of supply of new office and apartment space.
"We have seen occupancy rates and rental rates going up in many markets," said Joseph R. Betlej, co-manager of the $428 million Ivy Real Estate Securities fund. "And that is because construction lenders turned off the spigot in 2007, and today we are faced with a lack of new supply."
Ivy Real Estate Securities returned 5.7 percent in the first quarter after a 28 percent gain in 2010. Mr. Betlej's recent top holdings have included Simon Property; HCP, a REIT that invests in health care properties; and Equity Residential, the big United States apartment owner.
The perfect mix that allowed REITs to shine so brightly has prompted some analysts to warn, however, that they could now be overvalued and that investors who continue to pour money into real estate funds might wind up getting burned. After all, some analysts say, gains made when the Federal Reserve is making extraordinary efforts to keep interest rates near zero might be hard to replicate as the economy grows and inflation and interest rates start to rise.
Investors added $4.15 billion to real estate funds in the first quarter, according to EPFR Global, an analysis company based in Cambridge, Mass.
"I would argue that there are more risks than benefits in REITs at these prices," said Ryan Leggio, an analyst at Morningstar. "If interest rates go up, they are going to be in a world of hurt."
Rising rates make it more expensive for REITs to finance their property assets and to make acquisitions. With most of their income coming from longer-term leases, higher financing costs also can't be quickly passed on to tenants. REITs, by law, also must return 90 percent of their income to shareholders as dividends, making them attractive to yield-hungry investors. Higher interest rates would make other investments, like bonds and even bank certificates of deposit, more competitive.
The average dividend yield for REITs soared to more than 10 percent during the financial crisis, while yields of 10-year Treasury notes fell to near 2 percent. At the end of the first quarter, the dividend yield for equity REITs, which own commercial property and constitute the bulk of the market, was 3.46 percent, virtually the same as 10-year Treasuries.
Real estate fund managers acknowledge that higher interest rates could take some steam out of the commercial property market, but they say REITs will not be hurt much if any increase is modest and gradual.
"If rates are rising because of inflation, real estate has historically been viewed as an inflation hedge and a store of wealth," said David M. Lee, manager of the $2.9 billion T. Rowe Price Real Estate fund.
Mr. Lee, whose fund gained 6 percent in the first quarter after a gain of nearly 30 percent in 2010, said REITs could keep pace if rising rates were accompanied by stronger job growth. "We need jobs, jobs, jobs," he said. "We are dealing with a physical product that needs to be filled."
One bright spot, he said, is likely to be apartment REITs, which are benefiting from strong rental demand as homeownership rates decline because of the foreclosure crisis. "We perhaps made too much of an effort in the past to put people in homes they could not really afford," he said. "As more people recognize that homeownership is not a sure thing, you will have more renters by choice."
Among Mr. Lee's top holdings are two large United States apartment owners, Equity Residential and AvalonBay Communities.
MANAGERS say the most favorable environment for real estate funds -- and the REITs in which they invest -- would be an economy that improves enough to create more jobs but not enough to prompt major worries about inflation.
"If borrowing costs stay attractive while vacancy rates and credit ratings continue to improve -- that would be the ideal," said Mr. Gadsden of the Alpine Realty fund. "The best thing for REITs going forward is a Goldilocks scenario of not too hot, not too cold."

Abstract: Prices for a gallon of regular unleaded gas are topping $4 at more service stations nationwide, revisiting the bleak territory of three years ago, when the average price for a gallon of regular gas reached a peak of $4.11 on July 17, 2008, according to the Oil Price Information Service. The government's Energy Information Administration on Monday put the average price for a gallon of regular gasoline slightly higher at $3.79, up 10.7 cents from the previous week and nearly a dollar higher than the same time last year.

Full text: Gas prices are approaching record highs, but so far most Americans do not appear to be drastically cutting back their driving or even their spending as they did in 2008.
The question, economists agreed, is what happens if prices continue to go up and remain high.
Prices for a gallon of regular unleaded gas are topping $4 at more service stations nationwide, revisiting the bleak territory of three years ago, when the average price for a gallon of regular gas reached a peak of $4.11 on July 17, 2008, according to the Oil Price Information Service.
The survey of about 100,000 stations showed gas prices were now averaging $3.77 a gallon nationwide. The average is already more than $4 in California, Hawaii and Alaska, and analysts at the oil information service said drivers were paying more than $4 at some stations in at least three other states -- Illinois, Connecticut and New York.
The government's Energy Information Administration on Monday put the average price for a gallon of regular gasoline slightly higher at $3.79, up 10.7 cents from the previous week and nearly a dollar higher than the same time last year.
Even with the higher prices, economists said recent broad data had continued to be positive.
The labor market, for example has continued to strengthen, with the economy adding 216,000 jobs in March. And a survey of 25 retailers tracked by Thomson Reuters posted a 1.7 percent increase that same month, contrary to analysts' forecasts.
But economists are still trying to determine the longer-term economic impact.
"Once we cross the $4 threshold, the pain will become more palpable, and it is going to show up more noticeably in the reduction in future consumer spending," said Bernard Baumohl, the chief global economist for the Economic Outlook Group. He predicted that "spending on discretionary goods will be diminishing as the price of gasoline keeps moving higher."
He also pointed out that the government's retail sales figures for March, a broader measure that also takes into account more sectors and categories, will be released on Wednesday. "I would not be at all surprised that non-gasoline purchases are beginning to suffer," he said.
John Gamel, the director of gasoline research for MasterCard, noted the good jobs report last month. "It has been a tug of war," he said, between the improved labor market and any drag of higher gas prices.
He said that a MasterCard Advisors SpendingPulse report showed that gasoline consumption fell 3.6 percent in the week ending April 1, year on year, the fifth consecutive decline.
"Even with the better labor market, consumers are cutting back on their driving," Mr. Gamel said. "That is something we will have to watch."
The decline may also be caused by Americans' switch to more fuel-efficient cars since 2008.
"As bad as it is to see $4 pump prices," the economy is in better shape now than it was three years ago, said James W. Paulsen, the chief investment strategist for Wells Capital Management.
"The recent surge in energy prices may well slow the pace of economic recovery in the next few quarters," he wrote in a research note on Monday. "However, the different position and tenure of the U.S. job market could be the reason why the contemporary energy crisis may prove more a consumer irritant at the pump than a cycle-ending recession risk."
Economists are also saying that industries that depend on travel revenue, like recreation and hotel businesses, could feel the pinch over the Memorial Day weekend and during the summer.
The rise in gasoline prices began to gain steam after political turmoil surged in the Middle East in February. Commodity prices soared amid heightened concerns over supply disruptions, especially from Libya, even though other producers offered to make up for any shortfall. Crude prices climbed to their highest level in more than two years last Thursday, closing higher than $110.
"Money has been pouring into all commodities at an incredible pace for the last four months," said Tom Kloza, chief oil analyst with the Oil Price Information Service.
"I think we have hit the tipping point," he said of gasoline prices. "The sweet spot this year for economic growth without damaging demand was probably $3.25 to $3.75.
The surge in commodity prices has been so pronounced that Federal Reserve officials have commented on gasoline prices. On Monday, in fact, Janet L. Yellen, the vice chairwoman of the board of governors of the Fed, said that rising energy and food prices were creating "significant hardships" for many people and that the Fed was watching the effect on inflation.
Economists said they expected that Americans would make fewer nonessential trips by car, particularly over Memorial Day or for summer vacation, or would consolidate more trips for work with errands.
"People just don't have the elasticity in their budgets," said Robert Sinclair Jr., a spokesman for AAA New York.
Still, many Americans are like Jon Wood, a 49-year-old mechanic who, after the run-up in gas prices in 2008, reluctantly bought a Nissan Sentra for his 80-mile round-trip commute to his job in Greenwich, Conn.
Now, with the price for a gallon of gas at $4.19 at the station where he works, he is glad he did.
"I drive something very economical," Mr. Wood said of his car, a 1993 model that gives him 30 miles to the gallon on the highway. "Normally, it would not be my first choice."

Abstract: [...] we can't plausibly slash our way back to solid fiscal ground.

Full text: President Obama in his speech on Wednesday confronted a topic that is harder to address seriously in public than sex or flatulence: America needs higher taxes.
That ugly truth looms over today's budget battles, but politicians have mostly preferred to run from reality. Mr. Obama's speech was excellent not only for its content but also because he didn't insult our intelligence.
There is no single reason for today's budget mess, but it's worth remembering that the last time our budget was in the black was in the Clinton administration. That's a broad hint that one sensible way to overcome our difficulties would be to revert to tax rates more or less as they were under President Clinton. That single step would solve three-quarters of the deficit for the next five years or so.
Paradoxically, nothing makes the need for a tax increase more clear than the Republican budget proposal crafted by Representative Paul Ryan. The Republicans propose slashing spending far more than the public would probably accept -- even dismantling Medicare -- and rely on economic assumptions that are not merely rosy, but preposterous.
Yet even so, the Republican plan shows continuing budget deficits until the 2030s. In short, we can't plausibly slash our way back to solid fiscal ground. We need more revenue.
Kudos to Mr. Obama for boldly stating that truth in his speech -- even if he did focus only on taxes for the very wealthiest. I also thought he was right to say that we need spending cuts -- including in our defense budget. Mr. Obama didn't say so, but the United States accounts for almost as much military spending as the entire rest of the world put together.
As I see it, there are three fallacies common in today's budget discussions:
Republicans are the party of responsible financial stewardship, struggling to put America on a sound footing.
In truth, both parties have been wildly irresponsible, but in cycles. Democrats were more irresponsible in the 1960s, the two parties both seemed care-free in the '70s and '80s, and since then the Republicans have been staggeringly reckless.
After the Clinton administration began paying down America's debt, Republicans passed the Bush tax cuts, waded into a trillion-dollar war in Iraq, and approved an unfunded prescription medicine benefit -- all by borrowing from China. Then-Vice President Dick Cheney scoffed that "deficits don't matter."
This borrow-and-spend Republican history makes it galling when Republicans now assert that deficits are the only thing that matter -- and call for drastic spending cuts, two-thirds of which would harm low-income and moderate-income Americans, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. To pay for tax cuts heaped largely on the wealthiest Americans, Republicans in effect would gut Medicare and slash jobs programs, family planning and college scholarships. Instead of spreading opportunity, federal policy would cap it.
Low tax rates are essential to create incentives for economic growth: a tax increase would stifle the economy.
It's true that, in general, higher taxes tend to reduce incentives. But this seems a weak effect, often overwhelmed by other factors.
Were Americans really lazier in the 1950s, when marginal tax rates peaked at more than 90 percent? Are people in high-tax states like Massachusetts more lackadaisical than folks in a state like Florida that has no personal income tax at all?
Tax increases can also send a message of prudence that stimulates economic growth. The Clinton tax increase of 1993 was followed by a golden period of high growth, while the Bush tax cuts were followed by an anemic economy.
We can't afford Medicare.
It's true that America faces a basic problem with rapidly rising health care costs. But the Republican plan does nothing serious to address health care spending, other than stop paying bills. Indeed, Medicare is cheaper to administer than private health insurance (2 percent to 6 percent administrative costs, depending on who does the math, compared with about 12 percent for private plans). So the Republican plan might add to health care spending rather than curb it.
The real challenge is to control health care inflation. Nobody is certain how to do that, but the Obama health care law is testing some plausible ideas. These include rigorous research on which procedures work and which don't. Why pay for surgery on enlarged prostates if certain kinds of patients turn out to be better with no treatment at all?
Ever since Walter Mondale publicly committed hara-kiri in 1984 by telling voters that he would raise their taxes, politicians have run from fiscal reality. As baby boomers age and require Social Security and Medicare, escapism will no longer suffice. We need to have a frank national discussion of painful steps ahead, and since I'm not a politician, let me be perfectly clear: raise my taxes!

Abstract: Li Yong, vice minister of finance, wrote that developed nations were responsible for overprinting their own currencies, driving up the price of commodities and creating inflationary pressures in developing countries. "The issue of external imbalances is a sensitive topic related to the development rights and growth potential of China and other emerging economies, and is another political tool, after the exchange rate, used by developed nations such as the U.S. to curb China's economic development," Mr. Li wrote in the article, which was published on the Web site of the finance ministry.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The United States and its allies, frustrated in their efforts to pressure China directly to change its economic policies, are seeking to enlist other developing nations in an international campaign that China may find more palatable.
At a meeting of finance ministers from the Group of 20 nations on Friday, the United States hopes to advance a set of proposed standards for judging the risks that individual nations pose to the global economy. Those standards could be used by the end of the year to put a spotlight on China for suppressing its currency to keep its exports cheap.
Even if the exercise succeeds, the benefits are unlikely to be tangible or clear. The United States and China have wrangled for years over the relative value of their currencies. The Chinese have made modest concessions in recent years, but mostly because of internal concerns about inflation and economic dependence on exports.
A senior Treasury official said that it was important for countries to establish shared standards, and in particular to highlight that large deficits and large surpluses were two sides of the same issue and merited the same concern.
"This hasn't been on the table in the past, but that's where the conversation is moving now and that's helpful," said Lael Brainard, the Treasury under secretary for international affairs.
The purpose of the standards is not lost on China, which has resisted the process. In February, the Chinese fought successfully to exclude one important measure, reserves of foreign currencies, from the list of proposed standards.
China holds more than $2.85 trillion in foreign currency, the world's largest reserve. It has pursued an aggressive policy of printing renminbi to buy foreign currencies, lifting the value of those currencies and holding down the value of its own.
Earlier this week, a senior Chinese official published an article blasting the standards as a "political tool" intended to make developing nations like China pay for the economic recovery of developed nations like the United States.
Li Yong, vice minister of finance, wrote that developed nations were responsible for overprinting their own currencies, driving up the price of commodities and creating inflationary pressures in developing countries. Mr. Li wrote that the real goal of those countries was to increase demand for their own exports.
"The issue of external imbalances is a sensitive topic related to the development rights and growth potential of China and other emerging economies, and is another political tool, after the exchange rate, used by developed nations such as the U.S. to curb China's economic development," Mr. Li wrote in the article, which was published on the Web site of the finance ministry.
Still, China has shifted slowly in the direction sought by the international community in recent years. China's policy makers adopted a five-year plan in October that calls for domestic consumption to replace exports as the driver of economic growth. The country also has allowed its currency to appreciate 4.4 percent against the dollar since last June. American officials describe this as an effective increase of 10 percent because the rate of inflation in China is much higher than in the United States.
The United States has embraced an elevated role for the Group of 20 as the primary forum for international economic coordination.
The Group of 7, which previously played that role, is composed of nations with economies driven by consumption, and currencies that float freely in response to demand. The new seats at the table, by contrast, are held mostly by nations like China, India and Brazil that manage their currencies to create a competitive advantage for their exports.
There is broad agreement that the unbalanced relationship between those two sets of countries -- debtors on the one hand, exporters on the other -- is a major fault line that threatens global stability. There is much less agreement about the proper allocation of the economic pain associated with potential solutions.
The goal of the current process is to break that controversial issue into manageable pieces. France, the current chairman of the group, has spent this year simply trying to create agreement on the rules for analyzing nations that can be completed by the time heads of state meet in Cannes this fall. Those rules would be used to single out nations that posed the greatest risks for further study.
A French official said he hoped there would be "incremental progress" on Friday.
As if to underscore the gap that must be bridged, the two sides will meet separately on Thursday. Finance ministers from the Group of 7 will consult quietly in Washington. Meanwhile, heads of state from Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa -- the emerging powers known as BRICS -- are meeting on the Chinese island of Hainan.
The governor of Australia's central bank, Glenn Stevens, meanwhile warned Wednesday there was too much of a focus on the relationship between the United States and China.
Describing the issue of global imbalances in terms of two countries, he said, "risks oversimplifying problems and therefore lessening the likelihood of solutions." Mr. Stevens spoke to the American Australian Association in New York.
He noted that the United States once described its trade problems in terms of Japan.

Abstract: Reform your tax system to produce more revenue, which may mean raising tax rates or just forcing people to comply with existing laws. In each conversation, I was reminded that the creation of the euro led to interest rates declining sharply in peripheral countries and to economic booms.

Full text: The real Golden Rule, it has been said, goes like this: He who has the gold, rules.
They are trying that in Europe these days. Germany has the gold and it sees no reason other countries should not do as the Germans say.
The prescription for the so-called peripheral countries of the euro zone is simple: Enact the reforms Germany thinks are needed. Cut spending. Take wage and benefit cuts. Reform your tax system to produce more revenue, which may mean raising tax rates or just forcing people to comply with existing laws. Require people to work longer and retire later. Follow austerity as far as the eye can see.
Do all those things, and the rest of Europe will provide grudging assistance.
To some with the gold, this is simply a morality play. "They had their fun," a former European central banker told me a few weeks ago, speaking of the peripheral countries. A different official used the same words last week.
In each conversation, I was reminded that the creation of the euro led to interest rates declining sharply in peripheral countries and to economic booms. Those countries lost competitiveness in export markets because they tolerated inflation and did not hold the line on wages. Now, those who partied deserve the pain of hangovers.
It is probable that countries will follow the German prescription. From the perspective of a national government, the alternatives may seem worse.
But democracy can be messy. Will populations go along?
There are a couple of hints that they may not. One comes from Portugal, the other from Iceland, which is not in the euro zone but is in a mess.
In Portugal, the government is seeking a European bailout but seems not to have the authority to agree to one. The opposition has forced elections, which it is widely expected to win, but it won't say what it will do. In the meantime, the situation is in limbo, which may force Europe to help out before it can get any enforceable promises of reform.
In Iceland, the issue is whether the population should pay for the sins of its banks. The banks had big operations in Britain and the Netherlands, and when they collapsed, the British and Dutch governments made good on the deposits. The government of Iceland promised to pay the money back.
The amount is $5.8 billion, 46 percent of Iceland's gross domestic product in 2010. A similar bill sent to the United States would call for a payment of $6.8 trillion.
I'm not really clear on why Iceland should be responsible. No doubt its bank regulators performed abysmally. But where were the British and Dutch regulators when the banks were taking in deposits from their citizens?
For reasons good or bad, Iceland's citizens appear to be reluctant to pick up the bill. Nearly 60 percent of voters turned down the agreement backed by their government, which called for Iceland to pay the money over 30 years beginning in 2016. Britain and the Netherlands now plan to ask something called the European Free Trade Association Surveillance Authority to order Iceland to pay.
Both the Irish and Greek governments embraced the required austerity to get European help, and electorates threw out those deemed responsible for the mess. But there are signs that the new governments are losing support, and there is no indication of early economic recovery. Portugal's government fell precisely because the opposition would not sign off on the required austerity.
What would be happening without the euro?
Neither the boom nor the bust would have been as great in the peripheral countries. But when the bust did arrive, the currencies of those countries would have plunged in value. That would have made them poorer and unable to afford the imports they once bought. Prices, measured in local currencies, would have risen. In Ireland, where a property boom collapsed, that would have ameliorated the problems faced by homeowners who owe far more than their homes are worth. Exports would have gained competitiveness, stimulating some growth.
But of course there are no separate currencies. There is no provision for allowing a country to leave the euro zone. That idea was not even considered when it turned out that Greece had lied its way into the club. In retrospect, everyone might be better off if it had been kicked out.
It is hard to see how the euro zone can be undone, but it is even harder to see how it will prosper. The reforms being pushed on the peripheral countries seem to call for slow growth, at best, for a very long time. Unfortunately, bad economies do not produce extra tax receipts, which are needed for fiscal improvement. Perhaps starving those economies will eventually make them leaner and meaner. Perhaps it will kill them first.
When the euro was created, some hoped, and others feared, that the Continent would move closer to a unified government. Some euro backers said countries would more closely align their fiscal policies with those of Germany to avoid a crisis. They were right about the need, but wrong about the action. Instead, the boom enabled countries to put off reforms.
In a speech in New York this week, Andreas Dombret, a member of the executive board of the Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, said national governments in the euro zone remained "in charge of sound fiscal and economic policies," but there was now "a strict framework that exerts pressure toward discipline in order to ensure that every country acts in a way that is consistent with the interest of having a stable common currency."
In other words, elected governments can make decisions, so long as they are good ones.
Last week the European Central Bank raised interest rates, a move that made a lot more sense for the German economy than for most of the others in the euro zone.
Mr. Dombret praised that decision. "It is essential that inflation expectations remain anchored," he explained, adding, "It goes without saying that we did not complain about the headline of the Financial Times article on the rate hike. The article was entitled 'E.C.B. becomes Bundesbank.' "
There is a risk over time that democracy will lead Europe to splinter. Germans are angry about having to pick up the bill for bailouts of other countries, which is one reason the German government felt called upon to insist on that "strict framework." Others are resentful of the enforced austerity.
If European economies somehow grow enough, those resentments may not matter much. But if not, voter anger may intensify and demand that something change. Maybe the Germans will want to cut off their prodigal neighbors. Maybe the neighbors will decide they would be better off with a new currency and without overbearing demands for austerity that prevent recovery. In either case, populist politicians demanding the demise of the euro might win elections. The fact that European law does not allow for such a possibility would make the situation messier, but in the end voters would have their way.
It would be good if the debate in Europe focused less on justice -- Is it fair to ask Germans to bail out profligate Greeks? Is it fair for Europe to force wage cuts on citizens who were not responsible for the financial excesses of their countries' banks? -- and more on how to quickly get devastated economies growing again.

Full text: LONDON -- In the United States, the debate over how to cut the long-term budget deficit is just getting under way.
But in Britain, one year into its own controversial austerity program to plug a gaping fiscal hole, the future is now. And for the moment, the early returns are less than promising.
Retail sales plunged 3.5 percent in March, the sharpest monthly downturn in Britain in 15 years. And a new report by the Center for Economic and Business Research, an independent research group based here, forecasts that real household income will fall by 2 percent this year. That would make Britain's income squeeze the worst for two consecutive years since the 1930s.
All of which has challenged the view of Britain's top economic official, George Osborne, that during a time of high deficits and economic weakness, the best approach is to aggressively attack the deficit first, through rapid-fire cuts aimed at the heart of Britain's welfare state.
Doing so, says Mr. Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, secures the trust of the financial markets, and thereby ensures the low interest rates necessary for long-term economic growth.
That approach, and the question of whether it risks stifling an economic recovery that might itself help narrow the budget gap, lies at the root of the deficit debate in the United States. On one side is the go-slow strategy favored by President Obama. On the other is the more radical path championed by the Republicans. The two camps are no doubt closely watching Britain's experiment.
On paper, at least, both countries face broadly similar deficit challenges. Britain aims to close a fiscal gap of about 10 percent of gross domestic product. The comparable figure in the United States is 9.5 percent.
In Washington, the Republican proposal recently sketched out by Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin calls for broad and significant cuts in social spending, including Medicare and Medicaid, and wide-ranging tax cuts.
On Wednesday, President Obama called for a more balanced approach, one that he said would combine some tax increases for the wealthy with selective spending cuts that he said would not break the "basic social contract" of programs like Medicare and Medicaid.
While severe in its approach to spending cuts, the British plan lacks the stark sweep of the Republican proposal. Britons will certainly feel pain at the local government level as money dries up for care of the elderly, youth programs and trash collection. But icons like the National Health Service have largely been spared.
Other notable differences suggest that even Europe's most conservative party is markedly to the left of the mainstream Republican position in the United States, and in some ways is more liberal than the position Mr. Obama has taken.
To strike a political balance, the coalition government led by Prime Minister David Cameron of the Conservative Party, Mr. Osborne -- himself a Conservative -- has retained a 50 percent income tax rate on the wealthiest individuals. That is among the highest in Europe, and it imposes more of a burden on the rich than anything Mr. Obama or anyone else in Washington would find politically feasible.
But in Britain, the big worry now is not tax rates. Instead, the fear is that Mr. Osborne's emphasis on cuts in social spending -- which aim to achieve an approximate budget surplus by 2015 and are likely to result in the loss of more than 300,000 government jobs -- might tip the economy back into recession.
Already the government has had to slash its growth estimate to 1.7 percent, from 2.4 percent, for this year, as consumer incomes are under pressure from high inflation, weak wage growth and stagnant economic activity.
"My view is that we are in serious danger of a double-dip recession," said Richard Portes, an economist at the London Business School. "This is going to be a cautionary tale."
Not all economists agree, of course. And this week's slight improvement in the unemployment rate, to 7.8 percent from 7.9 percent, suggests it is still too early to declare a second slump inevitable.
No one would disagree with Mr. Portes that a deficit of 10 percent of G.D.P. is unsustainable in the long run. But, with the opposition Labour Party, he argues that moving so quickly in the face of weak economic growth is not justified.
Mr. Osborne proposes to slash the deficit to 1.5 percent by 2015. By comparison, the stark program Mr. Ryan offers does not project reaching that deficit target until 2021.
Besides the difference in speed, a crucial distinction is how each plan would reach its goal. Mr. Osborne's plan calls for 75 percent of savings to come from spending cuts, and the rest from mostly indirect revenue and tax increases -- an increase in the sales tax, for example.
Mr. Ryan, on the other hand, proposes to slash spending by $5.8 trillion but -- in contrast to the British approach -- would allow most of the spending reductions to be offset by $4.2 trillion in tax cuts, rather than applied to closing the deficit gap. In other words, while Mr. Ryan would lean heavily on spending cuts to close the deficit, he also hopes to spur the sort of supply-side economic growth most often discussed when Ronald Reagan was in the White House.
But while the continued lure of Reagan-style tax policy seems to have contributed significantly to the Ryan plan, Mr. Osborne has defied the popular caricature of him as a heartless Tory pushing a Thatcheresque agenda. He has refused to cut the tax rate for top earners, despite calls to do so from his party's right flank and Britain's powerful financial sector.
Such an approach might still be heresy to many Republicans in the United States. But in Britain, as in the rest of Europe, it has become widely accepted.
"It's hard to cut taxes and lower the deficit -- that is why personal tax cuts can't be justified," said Patrick Nolan, chief economist at Reform, a right-of-center research organization based here.
Mr. Osborne has taken other steps to make sure the wealthy pay their share, from taxing banks to the oil companies, which Mr. Osborne's top advisers say is crucial to convincing Britons that sacrifice will be shared. While gritting their teeth at these populist measures, Britain's businesses and banks have largely accepted Mr. Osborne's plan.
Last week, as Portugal became the third country in Europe, after Greece and Ireland, to petition the European Union for a financial bailout, Mr. Osborne was vocal in underscoring his central contention as a deficit hawk: that in this new debt-averse era, no country has the luxury of delaying the painful steps needed to balance government books.
Many analysts support that view.
"People can march and break windows all they like, but you can not get away from not cutting the deficit," Douglas McWilliams, the chief economist at the Center for Economic and Business Research and an author of its report on the plight of the British consumer.
His forecast of about 1 percent British economic growth this year is one of the lowest to be found anywhere. Yet he, too, says that to backtrack now from the government's austerity plan would be folly -- and would severely rattle the British bond market, which has been quite forgiving compared with the high interest rates the markets have imposed on Greece, Ireland and Portugal.
Remarkably, yields on the British government's 10-year bonds are slightly above the 3.6 percent or so achieved by Germany, which has Europe's healthiest economy. That is partly because Britain lies outside of the euro zone and can control its own monetary policy. But those relatively low interest rates have helped gird the support Mr. Osborne has so far received from the British business community.
In that sense, comparing the British and American deficit-cutting plans becomes a bit more difficult. In Europe the bond market is the ultimate judge of deficit-reduction plans. In the United States, by contrast, the global demand for Treasury bills, and the benefits of the Federal Reserve Board's easy-money "quantitative easing" policy, have kept 10-year bond yields well below those of Britain.
Those low American interest rates, in turn, have reduced the pressure on Washington to take more immediate, painful steps to pare the deficit.
But, as the example of Europe has borne out, at some stage foreign bond investors might tire of financing unsustainable deficits -- even Washington's. If and when they do, a government has little choice but to cut.
How deep, and how fast, depends on how long a government waits to begin.

Abstract: While consumers are feeling the pinch at gas stations and grocery stores, economists emphasized that the March results were in line with the Federal Reserve's view of the economy and should keep the policy-making board from raising its benchmark rate or ending its economic stimulus. With the rise in food prices and gasoline now averaging $3.82 for a gallon of regular unleaded, inflationary pressures are likely to continue to affect household budgets in the short term, economists said.

Full text: The cost of living for Americans rose in March, but the inflationary pressures were mostly limited to food and energy costs, a government report said Friday.
While consumers are feeling the pinch at gas stations and grocery stores, economists emphasized that the March results were in line with the Federal Reserve's view of the economy and should keep the policy-making board from raising its benchmark rate or ending its economic stimulus.
The Labor Department said that the Consumer Price Index rose 0.5 percent in March, matching a 0.5 percent rise in February. Gasoline and food prices accounted for almost three-quarters of the increase, but outside of those two areas, prices remained subdued. In the last 12 months, the index has increased 2.7 percent.
The core index, which excludes food and energy, rose 0.1 percent in March, compared with a 0.2 percent rise in February. The core index rose 1.2 percent in the last 12 months.
With the rise in food prices and gasoline now averaging $3.82 for a gallon of regular unleaded, inflationary pressures are likely to continue to affect household budgets in the short term, economists said. "So if you don't eat or drive a car, you are feeling little inflation," the chief economist for PNC Financial Services, Stuart Hoffman, said.
Analysts had forecast an increase of 0.5 percent in the broader index and a 0.2 percent rise in the core index.
But underlying pressures as reflected in the core index are low. Mr. Hoffman and other economists said that the index was within the "comfort zone" of the Federal Reserve, whose policy-making board meets on April 26. As such, they said they did not expect the Fed to take any action on rates or its quantitative easing program, known as QE2, which is purchasing $600 billion in government securities.
"I think they will say the economy is on firmer footing," Mr. Hoffman said. "At the end of the day they will reaffirm they are going to finish QE2."
But he emphasized that the central bank would remain concerned about inflation expectations of consumers, who could demand higher wages, and businesses, which could raise prices and perhaps cut spending.
The relatively slow increase of prices in the services sector, and the decline in apparel prices, were helping to offset price rises elsewhere, Dan Greenhaus, the chief economic strategist for Miller Tabak & Company, said in a research note.
Friday's report showed that prices for all types of gasoline rose 5.6 percent in March, after a 4.7 percent increase in February. It was the ninth consecutive increase in the gas index. Food costs increased 0.8 percent in March, after climbing 0.6 percent in February, the biggest jump since September 2008.
Economists have been concerned that higher energy costs will constrain consumer spending, even though they expect oil prices to decline in the second half of the year. Consumers have also been coping with a trend of higher food costs, as bad weather has hit some agricultural commodities, including corn and wheat, while vegetable prices have risen because of cold weather in parts of the South. Cotton prices have also soared.
Paul Ballew, a former Federal Reserve economist and a senior vice president for the Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company, said the Fed would be watching commodity prices over the coming months but would most likely remain on the sidelines until 2012 as it gauged the sustainability of the recovery.
"You will start to see them talk about their exit strategy going forward," he said.
Higher prices were also in focus in global economies. Higher consumer prices were reported Friday in India, Europe and China. In China, figures showed consumer prices rose 5.4 percent in March, up from February's 4.9 percent. Inflation in the 17-nation euro region increased to an annualized rate of 2.7 percent, from 2.4 percent in February, the European Union's statistics office reported Friday.
Japan was highlighted in another economic report in the United States on Friday. A Federal Reserve report said industrial production grew 0.8 percent in March, above analysts' forecasts of 0.6 percent and compared with a slight 0.1 percent rise in February. The report included a 0.7 percent rise in manufacturing output, especially for durables, and motor vehicles and parts. But in the coming months, the sector could start to feel disruptions in supply caused by the March 11 earthquake in Japan, economists from Goldman Sachs wrote in a research report. In the United States, the report on consumer prices came after one on prices for wholesalers on Thursday. In that report, the Labor Department said higher energy costs accounted for almost all of the increase in the Producer Price Index, which was up 0.7 percent in March, when prices for a barrel of crude oil reached levels not seen since September 2008, partly as turmoil in the Middle East heightened perceptions that supplies could be disrupted.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Brazil's finance minister said Saturday that developed nations like the United States were seeking to solve their own economic problems at the expense of the developing world.
The minister, Guido Mantega, said wealthy countries were attempting "to export their way out of difficult economic situations" by printing money and keeping interest rates low. Those policies are driving up the prices of food and oil, causing particular pain for the world's poorest people, Mr. Mantega told the policy-making committee of the International Monetary Fund.
His strong remarks highlight the challenges the United States and Europe face as they try to change their economic relationship with the developing world. In place of unsustainable borrowing to fuel consumption of imported goods, they would like to sell more goods and services to those countries. The problem is that developing nations, losing business from their best customers, hope to replace sales by increasing domestic consumption -- selling to the same customers developed nations are trying to reach.
It is a dispute that plays out largely in terms of exchange, with both sides charging that their rivals are boosting exports by artificially suppressing the value of their currencies.
The two sides spoke past each other over the last week, during the annual meetings of the major forums for international economic coordination -- the monetary fund, the World Bank and the Group of 20.
The United States says that higher prices are not a necessary consequence of American policies, but instead have resulted from the efforts of developing countries to hold down the value of their own currencies in the face of the capital inflows from developed countries.
The treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, said Saturday that developing nations should allow the value of their currencies to be determined by open-market trading. The United States believes that the exchange rates set by the market will contribute to a more sustainable allocation of economic activity among nations, and increased international growth.
"Major economies -- advanced and emerging -- need to allow their exchange rates to adjust in response to market forces," Mr. Geithner said.
Rising concerns about inflation shadowed the debate. Commodity prices and asset values are already rising sharply in the developing world, and there is concern that those pressures could contribute to inflation in developed countries.
Economic development in China and other emerging markets has long been felt in the United States largely in the form of lower prices. As those countries absorb a larger share of the world's raw and finished goods, the impact instead may be felt in the form of rising prices.
"Interest rates rising in the emerging world could drive up interest rates in the developing world," said Tharman Shanmugaratnam, the finance minister of Singapore and the new chairman of the International Monetary and Financial Committee. "We've learned from very painful experience during the last few years that nothing is isolated."
Economic policy makers in the United States have played down the impact of commodity prices on domestic inflation. European policy makers, by contrast, are increasingly concerned.
Didier Reynders, the Belgian finance minister, warned in a statement that "one should not underestimate" the possibility that food and oil price inflation could travel from the developing world to Europe and the United States. He noted that those pressures would pass through the same financial and trade channels that helped to lower global inflation in the past by holding down prices. "Central banks everywhere should be highly vigilant," Mr. Reynders said.

Full text: SHANGHAI -- As the United States and Europe struggle to get their economies rolling again, China is having the opposite problem: figuring out how to keep its revved-up growth engine from generating runaway inflation.
The latest sign that things were moving too fast came on Sunday, when China's central bank ordered the biggest banks to set aside more cash reserves.
The move essentially reduces the amount of money available for loans, and is an attempt to cool down the economy. It follows the government announcement on Friday that China's economy was growing at an annual rate of 9.7 percent, by far the strongest performance by any of the world's biggest economies.
Because China is now the world's second largest economy, after the United States, and because the country has been a leading source of global growth during the last two years, money problems here can reverberate from Wal-Mart to Wall Street and the world beyond.
High inflation endangers China's status as the low-cost workshop for the world. And if the government's efforts to fight inflation cause the economy to stumble, that will cloud the outlook for international businesses -- whether multinationals like General Electric or copper miners in Chile -- that have been counting on China for growth.
Inside China, inflation also poses a threat to social stability, a particular worry for Beijing, especially since authoritarian governments in North Africa and the Middle East have become the focus of popular uprisings.
"China's inflation is a big concern, and actual numbers are worse than officially reported," said Carmen M. Reinhart, an economist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.
She says Beijing is engaged in an economic tug of war, trying to encourage sustainable growth while struggling to control inflation.
Food prices are soaring, and the government said on Friday that the consumer price index in March had risen 5.4 percent, its sharpest increase in nearly three years. Hoping to tame inflation, in the last six months Beijing has tightened restrictions on bank lending and raised interest rates on loans (to discourage borrowing) and deposits (to encourage savings).
The decision on Sunday to raise the capital reserve ratio for banks, to 20.5 percent of their cash, was the fourth such increase this year.
The government has also increased agricultural subsidies to curb food prices, and tried to forbid some Chinese companies from raising consumer prices. These efforts stand in contrast to those in the United States, where inflation is low (the underlying annual inflation rate was 1.2 percent last month) and where the debate centers on how much to stimulate the economy given the size of the deficit. Inflation is also running low in Europe, where some countries are imposing harsh austerity measures to pare their budget gaps.
But analysts say the results of this economic management have been mixed. Growth has begun to moderate from its torrid pace of about 10 percent annual growth but inflation has become worse.
For example, housing prices continue to climb even though Beijing has long promised to curb the property market and to spend billions of dollars over the next few years on affordable housing.
The average apartment in central Shanghai now costs more than $500,000. Even in second-tier cities like Chengdu, in central China, the price of a typical home costs about 25 times the average annual income of residents.
Analysts say too much of the country's growth continues to be tied to inflationary spending on real estate development and government investment in roads, railways and other multibillion-dollar infrastructure projects.
In the first quarter of 2011, fixed asset investment -- a broad measure of building activity -- jumped 25 percent from the period a year earlier, and real estate investment soared 37 percent, the government said on Friday.
Some of the inflationary factors, like global commodity and food prices, may be beyond Beijing's ability to influence. Gasoline prices have also jumped sharply, in line with global oil prices. As the world's largest car market, China's demand for fuel is soaring, and gasoline prices are close to $4.50 a gallon, up from $3.82 a gallon in late 2009.
Rising food prices, meanwhile, are showing up in various ways -- including higher prices at fast-food chains, like Master Kong, which in January raised the price of its popular instant noodles by about 10 percent.
China's current supercharged boom began in early 2009, during the global financial crisis, when Beijing moved aggressively to increase growth with a $586 billion stimulus package and record lending by state-run banks.
The loose monetary policy, and big investments in local government projects, did revive economic growth. But even at the time there were already concerns about soaring property prices, undisciplined bank lending and the huge debts being amassed by local governments.
The fear among some experts is that the bubble will eventually burst, leading to a wave of nonperforming loans at the big state-owned Chinese banks, which have been the main financiers of the nation's phenomenal growth dating to the economic reforms in the 1980s.
Some economists have begun to argue that high inflation may be around for some time. Here again, the tug of war is evident.
To encourage the growth of a consumer market that will help meet the Chinese people's demand to share the nation's wealth, Beijing and many municipal governments have required employers to raise wages.
The government has raised minimum wages in the hope of reducing the big income gap between the rich and the poor, and the urban and rural. But higher wages drive up the costs of production, leading to higher prices. Some experts say rising wages may be an unavoidable inflationary force for years to come.
"China is moving into a new era, a new norm," said Dong Tao, an economist at Credit Suisse in Hong Kong. "In the previous decade, inflation was about 1.8 percent a year; in the next decade, it may be closer to 5 percent."
The implications of such a shift are huge, not just for domestic consumers but perhaps even more so for exports. As wages and production costs rise, coastal factories are demanding higher prices for the goods they ship overseas. That means Americans, Europeans and other buyers will have to pay more for those goods or seek lower-cost suppliers elsewhere. In some cases, retailers are bidding for goods at prices the exporters consider too low.
"I hear that many Chinese exporters are rejecting orders from Wal-Mart and other Western retailers," Mr. Tao said. "I've been covering the Chinese economy for a long time, and I've never heard that before."
Many analysts say the government is going to have to do even more to slow the economy, through measures like placing additional restrictions on lending and continuing to raise interest rates, the textbook methods of fighting inflation by tightening the nation's money supply.
But the mixed results so far do not inspire widespread confidence. In fact, some experts say that despite the Communist Party's efforts to manage the economy by committee, the absence of a top autonomous central banker -- Beijing has no equivalent of the United States Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke -- means no one actually has a hand on the growth throttle.
"The roots of inflation were laid down after the financial crisis, with the stimulus policy," said Zhang Weiying, a professor of economics at Peking University.
After a big stimulus, stamping out inflation is not easy, Professor Zhang said. "It may take a long time."
Citizens like Wang Jianren, 56, a retiree in Shanghai, a bustling city of 20 million, say that over the years China has benefited from its rapid economic growth. But like so many here, he complains that inflation is beginning to erode those gains.
"Prices have gone up a lot," Mr. Wang said at an indoor vegetable market on Friday. "Unstable prices make people nervous and make society unstable. In this sense, our generation even has some nostalgia for Mao's era."

Full text: "Let's tell the truth," Walter Mondale said, accepting the Democratic nomination in 1984. "Mr. Reagan will raise taxes, and so will I. He won't tell you. I just did."
Three months later, Mondale lost 49 states, and liberal politicians learned a valuable lesson. In the decades since, national Democrats have often promised to raise taxes -- but only for the rich, and never for the middle class.
Bill Clinton wrote the playbook: "We will lower the tax burden on middle-class Americans," he pledged in 1992, "by asking the very wealthy to pay their fair share." In 2008, Barack Obama imitated Clinton, campaigning on a promise to raise taxes for the richest 5 percent while cutting them for everybody else.
Last week, in his address on deficit reduction, the president followed the playbook once again. In the throat-clearing section of the speech, Obama promised "tough choices" that put "everything on the table." But his tax proposals were aptly summarized by The Atlantic's Clive Crook: "The rich can pay for it all."
As it happens, they can't. Squeezing the wealthy buys some short-term deficit reduction: over the next decade, President Obama's plan could trim (almost) as much off the deficit as Paul Ryan's controversial Republican budget -- $4 trillion, give or take.
But that $4 trillion is just a fraction of America's projected long-term debt. The whole point of the Ryan plan is that the real deficit reduction starts at year 10, when his Medicare reforms are phased in.
Under the president's plan, we soak the rich in the short term, and then just keep going deeper into the red.
Does a plan to cut the deficit with middle-class tax increases exist? In a sense, it does. It's called the "current law baseline," a Congressional Budget Office projection in which the Bush-era tax rates aren't renewed in 2012, the Alternative Minimum Tax (which is supposed to hit only the rich but increasingly bites into middle-class paychecks) isn't indexed for inflation, and Medicare payments to doctors are slashed by 20 percent.
With these policies, the deficit drops away in the next 10 years, and more important, it stays manageably low for the decades after that.
This projection has become a touchstone for liberal wonks -- "the graph that all budget discussions should start with," The Washington Post's Ezra Klein wrote last week. It does not represent their ideal policy vision by any means, but it is frequently cited as proof that we do not need to radically reform entitlements to keep the country solvent.
All we need to do instead is let taxes rise and keep on rising. This is how the "current law baseline" cuts the deficit: Thanks to inflation and bracket creep, its tax code gradually subjects more and more Americans to rates that now fall only on the wealthy.
Today, for instance, a family of four making the median income -- $94,900 -- pays 15 percent in federal taxes. By 2035, under the C.B.O. projection, payroll and income taxes would claim 25 percent of that family's paycheck. The marginal tax rate on labor income would rise from 29 percent to 38 percent. Federal tax revenue, which has averaged 18 percent of G.D.P. since World War II, would hit 23 percent by the 2030s and climb even higher after that.
Such unprecedented levels of taxation would throw up hurdles to entrepreneurship, family formation and upward mobility. (Or as the C.B.O. puts it, in its understated way, they would "tend to discourage some economic activity," and "harm the economy through the impact on people's decisions about how much to work and save.")
They could have ugly political consequences as well. Historically, the most successful welfare states (think Scandinavia) have depended on ethnic solidarity to sustain their tax-and-transfer programs. But the working-age America of the future will be far more diverse than the retired cohort it's laboring to support. Asking a population that's increasingly brown and beige to accept punishing tax rates while white seniors receive roughly $3 in Medicare benefits for every dollar they paid in (the projected ratio in the 2030s) promises to polarize the country along racial as well as generational lines.
The Republican vision for entitlement reform, President Obama said last week, would lead to "a fundamentally different America" than the one we inhabit today. He's right: asking the elderly to pay more for their health care, as Paul Ryan proposes to do, would transform the American social contract, and cause no small amount of pain.
But what Obama didn't acknowledge is that the alternative path could lead to a different country as well -- a more stagnant and balkanized society, in which our promise to the elderly crowds out the fundamental promise of America itself.

Full text: In their budget-cutting zeal, Republicans are demanding harsh sacrifices from the country's most vulnerable citizens. At the same, they are determined to leave one of the biggest areas of wasteful government spending untouched: the Pentagon budget.
The budget plan they pushed through the House this month would spend $7.5 trillion on the military over the next dozen years. And that does not include the cost of actual war-fighting. The country cannot afford to spend that much, and it doesn't need to.
The $7.5 trillion was President Obama's projection, which he has since lowered to $7.1 trillion. Saving $400 billion is better but still not enough, especially since it can be achieved merely by holding annual nonwar-related spending at its current swollen level, adjusted for inflation.
National security is a fundamental responsibility of government. Since Sept. 11, 2001, the Pentagon has spent without limits and in some cases without sense. Annual budgets, adjusted for inflation, have grown by 50 percent in the past decade. And that is apart from the more than $1 trillion spent on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.
The White House and Congress must impose some rationality on this process. Here is a path that could save hundreds of billions of dollars more through 2024:
PERSONNEL Pay and benefits account for nearly half of the basic Pentagon budget. The size of the uniformed services should not be reduced, at least for now. The Pentagon's civilian work force, currently 650,000, should be cut by up to 10 percent, saving more than $7 billion a year.
We in no way minimize the sacrifices made by our men and women in uniform. But after years of lagging far behind, military pay is now more than $5,000 a year higher than comparable civilian employment, more than $10,000 a year higher when special allowances and benefits are counted. Freezing noncombat pay for three years would save $3 billion per year. The formula for future increases should be adjusted to incorporate allowances and benefits, saving an additional $5 billion a year.
Another $4 billion to $6 billion annually could be saved by reasonable increases in annual health insurance premiums for military retirees of working age. Those premiums -- currently $460 per family -- have been frozen for the past 15 years while health care costs soared.
All told, these changes would save about $20 billion annually or more than $200 billion over the next 12 years.
FORCE STRUCTUREThe Pentagon took too long to recognize that today's wars make more intensive demands on the Army and Marines and less on the Navy and Air Force. Ground forces have been increased, but that needs to be paid for by corresponding reductions at sea and in the air. That shift has already begun but needs to go further. Another $1 billion to $2 billion a year could be saved by reducing the number of aircraft carrier groups from 11 to 10 and associated air wings from 10 to 9.
PROCUREMENT Twenty years after the cold war's end, the Pentagon is addicted to hugely expensive weapons systems that are poorly suited to current and future military needs. Defense Secretary Robert Gates successfully pressed Congress to end production of the costly Air Force F-22. He now needs to cut way back on the far overbudget F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. Far fewer of these are needed to assure American dominance of the skies. Terminating the deeply troubled Marine Corps version of the F-35 and cutting back the Navy and Air Force versions by 50 percent would save $130 billion over the life of the program, with most of those savings achieved in the 2020s. Eliminating the Marine Corps' costly and accident-prone V-22 Osprey vertical take off and landing aircraft would save another $10 billion to $12 billion. Further savings may be possible by scaling down future orders for the Virginia class nuclear attack submarine and reconsidering the newly vulnerable littoral combat ship.
For too long America's military spending decisions have been insulated from serious scrutiny or discipline. The result is that more than 50 cents of every dollar of discretionary federal spending now goes to the Pentagon. There is no way to bring the deficit under control without making substantial and rational cuts in that budget.

Full text: CORRECTION APPENDED
Raj Rajaratnam, the founder of the Galleon Group hedge fund, may soon know the result of his gamble. Closing arguments are expected on Wednesday in his insider trading trial. With the evidence against him looking strong, it's not obvious why he risked fighting the charges. But the decision was smarter than it looks.
The choices were all rotten for Mr. Rajaratnam. He could have pleaded guilty and agreed with prosecutors on a sentence. But doing so would have locked him into a tight range of possible time behind bars, with no leeway to argue for less. Alternatively, he could have pleaded guilty with no deal and asked for leniency when sentenced. Either choice would have precluded an appeal.
Yet it isn't surprising the once high-flying hedge fund manager suffered opprobrium for going to trial. Witnesses at the trial in Federal District Court in Manhattan testified about breaking the law to give him inside information. Tape recordings revealed chatter about still-confidential corporate events. Other conversations suggested a cover-up using bogus e-mails. The trial has aired what appears to be the dirtiest of the laundry.
Even so, forgoing a plea has already produced benefits. The prosecution knocked down the number of charges to 14, from 37. As important, Mr. Rajaratnam's lawyers had six weeks to spin the idea that Galleon gathered information from all over to create a mosaic of data on a company. Any single tidbit, even from the inside, was not important enough to be material to an investment decision, the defense contended. So trading on individual nuggets couldn't have been illegal.
This defense is controversial, but not frivolous. It paints a picture of a diligent, if aggressive, investor. Only one juror has to buy it to spare Mr. Rajaratnam. And even if none does, the judge might -- and he has discretion to lighten any sentence.
It could all backfire, with the jury and judge concluding the Galleon founder is an even bigger crook than many expect. But that's always a risk. In most cases, Mr. Rajaratnam is no worse off -- and potentially better -- than he would be had he pleaded guilty. And this way, if the worst happens, he can claim he was nailed by an ignorant jury and appeal. All he has to lose is the cost of his lawyers, and he's a billionaire.
A Time to Hedge
South Korean stocks offer an obvious play on Japan's postquake woes and a United States recovery. But it's a risky trade, one vulnerable to near-term surprises in economic data. Investors venturing to Korea need to hedge against bad news in the United States, or good news in Japan.
Seoul's equity market has been among the world's best performers in the month since the Japanese disaster, climbing 10 percent. With Japan's production of cars and microchips hobbled by shortages of power and parts, foreign investors are betting South Korean companies will fill the gap. They've loaded up on at least $4.1 billion in South Korean shares since the quake.
That has produced some outsize investment winners, like Hyundai BNG Steel, whose shares have nearly doubled since March 15. Even so, South Korean stocks still seem decent bargains by most measures, trading at just over 10 times projected earnings. Shares of SK Holdings, the semiconductor maker, have climbed 45 percent but still trade at roughly 9 times projected earnings.
Risks abound, however. If Japan can restore production of critical materials and components within three months, the South Korean substitution bonanza may never materialize. And with the Federal Reserve's quantitative easing ending in June, it's unclear America's recovery will continue.
South Korea's domestic outlook isn't so rosy, either. The economy is especially vulnerable to high oil prices. And the central bank is already battling inflation with a potentially dangerous mix of rate increases and currency appreciation. The won has gained 15 percent since last May. If it is allowed to rise too fast, exporters will suffer. If authorities push rates up too quickly, South Korea's indebted households could start defaulting.
For investors, rising exports and a climbing currency present a heady mixture. They would be well advised to hedge their South Korean stock positions with either a smattering of zero-coupon Korean bonds, longer-dated put options or by short-selling the index. South Korea is all the rage this spring, but a new season could bring a change in the investment climate, too.

A Surge in Gold Nears a Limit

Abstract: Gold bugs fear the Federal Reserve will buy more domestic debt, devaluing the dollar and precipitating inflation, making gold -- now at more than $1,500 a troy ounce -- all the more precious. Currently, after exports and domestic consumption, Saudi Arabia has spare capacity estimated at 2.8 million barrels a day, a crucial buffer amounting to about 3 percent of global oil consumption.

Full text: Worried about the euro zone? Buy gold. Worried about the federal deficit? Buy gold. Fancy a quick speculative bet? Well, you can't lose with gold or silver, which has almost tripled in price in just over six months. But precious metals can't be both havens and speculative plays.
The gold and silver bugs will say global sovereign risks justify their outlook. Standard & Poor's has just put a negative outlook on its rating of the United States. Uncle Sam isn't about to default, but still lacks a plan to straighten his finances. Gold bugs fear the Federal Reserve will buy more domestic debt, devaluing the dollar and precipitating inflation, making gold -- now at more than $1,500 a troy ounce -- all the more precious.
A weak dollar ought to favor the euro. But that saddles investors with different sovereign risks. The euro zone won't print money, because Germany has had high inflation before and doesn't want a repeat. But countries on the periphery of the euro zone can't pay their way, hence fears that Greece must undergo a debt restructuring that would be messy for its banks and risk contagion.
This combination would be compelling if the interest rate outlook were benign and gold didn't already look pumped up by speculative buying. But the specter of inflation means rates are already rising outside the United States. The European Central Bank, for instance, is already raising rates. And global recovery is well under way, with the likes of Intel and I.B.M. reporting strong earnings. The latest Institute for Supply Management survey of United States manufacturing says the recent trend of "rapid growth" continued in March. Surveys confirm a German manufacturing boom. China's gross domestic product grew at an annualized 9.7 percent in the first quarter.
The likelihood is that the Fed will join the global trend and raise rates late this year or early next. The opportunity cost of holding precious metals will then rise. The end of ultra-cheap money in the United States threatens buoyant equity and commodity markets too -- but they get an offsetting benefit from the growth that is driving monetary tightening. With these markets rightly signaling global recovery, the precious metals bubble looks set to be pricked before long.
Oil Thirst in Mideast
Middle Eastern demand for its own oil could be a bigger threat to the global energy balance than unrest in the region -- at least in the long term. Rising demand at home threatens to limit Saudi Arabia's major role as the world's swing producer and could spell structurally higher prices for global markets.
A Saudi official this month expressed unusual public concern about the nation's energy use. Oil consumption, bolstered by car use and air-conditioning, has risen by half in the last decade to an estimated 2.7 million barrels a day this year. Saudi Aramco, the national oil group, estimates demand could reach 8.3 million barrels by 2030.
Currently, after exports and domestic consumption, Saudi Arabia has spare capacity estimated at 2.8 million barrels a day, a crucial buffer amounting to about 3 percent of global oil consumption. Aramco's forecast suggests that could be fully absorbed by domestic demand this side of 2025.
Meanwhile, oil consumption in Kuwait is rising fast enough to start reducing exports within a decade, the Brookings Institution says. The Middle East is likely to be consuming 11 million barrels a day by 2035, up from roughly six million in 2007, according to the International Energy Agency, a rate of increase second only to fast-growing Asian economies.
Indonesia offers a cautionary tale. In 1980, it exported 1.2 million barrels of oil a day. A tripling of domestic consumption since then -- driven in part by hefty subsidies -- has made it a net importer. Low oil prices at home play their part in encouraging Middle Eastern demand, too. The cost of gasoline in Saudi Arabia, for instance, is less than a sixth the level in the United States.
Attempts to remove such subsidies are politically perilous. But almost giving oil away at home when it could draw $100 a barrel abroad doesn't make economic sense. Though Saudi Arabia has outlined plans to increase capacity significantly if needed, some believe it may already be near its peak production.
For now, the world remains amply supplied with oil despite the turmoil in Libya. But the long-term trend suggests a less comfortable future. Too much delay by the United States and others in finding alternatives to imported oil could eventually become very expensive.

Full text: The price of gold rose above $1,500 an ounce on Wednesday for the first time, pushed higher by investor concerns about global inflation, government debt and turmoil in the Arab world.
The prices of other precious metals, like silver and platinum, have also surged recently on what analysts call a flight to quality, when uncertainty about the economic and political outlook sends investors into assets that are perceived to be safest.
"We're seeing a perfect storm for gold and silver prices," said Robin Bhar, a senior metals analyst in London for the French bank Credit Agricole.
The list of factors that have supported the price of precious metals in recent weeks is long. It includes worries about the sustainability of European debt levels and whether countries like Greece will soon default; the weaker dollar; rising inflation in many parts of the world; continued unrest in North Africa and the Middle East, which has also pushed up oil prices; and concern over the United States budget, which also stirred fear in world stock markets earlier in the week.
Stocks recovered somewhat Wednesday after strong earnings reports restored investor confidence, analysts said.
Other factors that are helping precious metals include the buildup to the early autumn wedding season in India, during which families lavish gifts of gold on brides; the longstanding shortage of skilled labor and equipment at certain mines; and the increase in the number of mutual funds investing in gold.
The recent popularity of gold-based exchange-traded funds has also propelled prices of the underlying metal by making it easier for more investors to trade in gold.
Each share in a gold exchange-traded fund represents part of an ounce of bullion, but it comes without the inconvenience of holding the metal or the risk of buying futures and options. Before such funds became popular in the middle of the last decade, individuals who wanted to invest in gold had to buy gold jewelry, coins or bullion -- and pay the high security and transaction costs. They could also invest in the shares of gold mining companies -- more of an arm's-length exercise -- although the cost of investing in those companies has also risen recently.
In addition to benefiting from increased demand for the underlying metal, gold and silver futures contracts are seen as attractive substitutes for paper investments, given that they can be redeemed for a physical commodity.
"Gold is sometimes a currency, sometimes a commodity and sometimes a store of value," analysts at Merrill Lynch wrote recently.
Gold for June delivery rose as high as $1,506.50 a troy ounce during trading in New York on Wednesday before settling at $1,498.90, a gain of $3.80 on the day. It was the first time that gold had breached the $1,500 level.
While that represented the highest level in nominal terms, the inflation-adjusted price was higher during the early 1980s, when it was well above $2,000 in current dollars.
Silver prices also climbed on Wednesday. Silver for May delivery climbed 1.2 percent, to $44.46 a troy ounce in New York, after rising as high as $45.40, the highest price since 1980. A troy ounce is 31.1 grams, or 1.1 ounces.
Although gold prices are likely to remain volatile and are vulnerable to retreat as investors take profits on their gains, few analysts are willing to bet on a sharp reversal in the near term. "As the purchasing power of workers in emerging markets increases, we see demand for gold as a commodity increasing over the next few years," the Merrill Lynch report said.
In a research note published Friday, Goldman Sachs forecast a gold futures price of $1,690 an ounce in 12 months' time, driven primarily by the assumption that the Federal Reserve's continued stimulus policy, known as quantitative easing, would keep interest rates low in the United States, bolstering demand for the metal as an investment.
The market for silver, which Mr. Bhar of Credit Agricole described as a "poor man's gold," is far more illiquid than gold. Mr. Bhar said several hedge funds appeared to have been "bullying" the price higher in recent sessions. Prices of palladium and platinum have also climbed.
Less valuable base metals like copper, tin, aluminum and zinc, which are used in large quantities in construction and heavy industries, have also climbed since last year, after plummeting during the financial crisis.
But among these commodities, there have been more divergences, according to Jim Lennon, head of commodity research in London for Macquarie Securities.
Markets for commodities like coking coal, used to make steel, iron ore and copper have been tight, he said, driven by inventory accumulation from producers and concerns about output bottlenecks at mines in Africa, Australia, Brazil, Chile and China.
For other base metals like aluminum, zinc and nickel, supply and demand appear better matched, he added.
Overhanging many of these markets remained the question of China, and whether its roaring economy might soon cool down. Many metals' traders and analysts have had to become China watchers, poring over the economic data issued by that country and studying accumulations of stocks in Chinese warehouses. During the first quarter, China's economy expanded 9.7 percent from a year earlier.
Investment and consumer spending in China have remained robust despite the government's effort to temper growth through interest rate increases and curbs on bank lending.

Full text: The Easter special at many retailers this year involves higher price tags.
As retailers have been warning, their costs are rising as cotton and other materials get more expensive, laborers in China demand higher wages and fuel prices go up. By this fall, many have said, they must charge customers more. Because retailers pay for items about six months in advance, spring merchandise on the shelves for a few months was ordered and paid for in late summer, before costs soared. And when costs first started creeping up, clothing makers used an array of tactics to keep prices flat, whether by moving production to lower-cost countries like Bangladesh, using cheaper fabrics or ordering early to lock in prices.
By this time, though, retailers are running out of ways to avoid passing on the higher expenses. An uptick has quietly begun.
Companies are "raising prices, but are trying not to broadcast it for competitive reasons, and it also doesn't look good for public relations reasons," said John D. Morris, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets.
"They're doing it before they're actually incurring some of the higher costs," Mr. Morris said, adding that steeper increases will mainly occur in the fall and winter.
Several stores have couched recent increases inside promotions, or nudged price tags up by a little under 10 percent, the point at which many shoppers' radar picks up on the move. For example, at American Eagle Outfitters, the price of striped polo shirts was raised about a week ago to $34.50, up from $29.50. At Brooks Brothers, a wrinkle-free shirt is $88, up from $79.50 in January.
The increases have not been imposed from rack to rack. Retailers and analysts say stores are testing to see where customers will accept higher prices. Will shoppers accept more expensive jeans, but revolt if the price of T-shirts rises? Will they stop buying socks if the price goes up by 50 cents? What about $3?
Gauging customers' reactions could help retailers avoid errors in pricing when they make widespread changes in the autumn. At American Eagle, "there are areas within the categories that we do believe that we can take prices up," said Roger S. Markfield, vice chairman and executive creative director, in the company's March conference call. "In the right items, the customer responds as though there was no price increase."
"In the areas where we have tested and it is not possible, we will not do that," he said.
Aeropostale, too, has begun increasing prices selectively, executives said on its fourth-quarter conference call.
"Like us, some of our peers are testing different things and testing higher prices, and primarily in preparation for the back half of the year," Thomas P. Johnson, the chief executive of Aeropostale, said. "However, there is still uncertainty surrounding the macroeconomic environment and the consumers' response to higher prices." Right now, a long-sleeved Ralph Lauren men's shirt costs $95, up from $89, an increase of about 7 percent, while a women's gingham oxford at J. Crew costs $72, up from $69.50 a year ago, an increase of nearly 4 percent.
Janney Capital Markets follows prices and promotions at a group of specialty retailers. In mid-April of last year, it noted that Charlotte Russe was selling swimwear at $14.50 and up. Now, swimsuits sell for $16.50 and up.
Flip-flops at The Children's Place had been two for $5, and now are two for $6.
Bullhead-brand jeans for girls at Pacific Sunwear were two for $55 last year, Janney said. Now, they are two for $59.
And cotton underwear at Soma Intimates, once five for $25, now sell for five for $25.50.
Like Soma, other retailers are hiding higher prices in complicated promotions. The teenage retailer Zumiez, for instance, went from an offer of three T-shirts and two pairs of jeans for $85, to two T-shirts and two pairs of jeans for $80. (Hopefully its customers have already taken algebra.)
While virtually all retailers have said that prices will climb in 2011, across-the-board price increases have not yet been reflected in the Consumer Price Index. In March, apparel and jewelry prices were 0.5 percent below where they had been in February, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said.
Though retailers were expecting more outrage, shoppers so far do not seem put off by the increases.
"A number of them seemed encouraged that customers weren't backing away as of yet," said John Long, a retail strategist at the consulting firm Kurt Salmon Associates. "They hadn't encountered much in the way of resistance, which they found surprising."
At The Children's Place, which recently changed the standard ending on its items from X.50 to X.95, customers "didn't really even notice in these early rounds," Mr. Morris of BMO Capital Markets said.
Although shoppers are taking the hit on the higher prices for now, Mr. Morris said the tactic could be smart for the retailers.
"In a way, that's not a bad strategy because their customer is less likely to have sticker shock when they really have to ratchet up come the third quarter," he said.

Full text: Greenwich, Conn.
IT is obvious that the nation's desperate fiscal condition requires higher taxes on the middle class, not just the richest 2 percent. Likewise, entitlement reform requires means-testing the giant Social Security and Medicare programs, not merely squeezing the far smaller safety net in areas like Medicaid and food stamps.
Unfortunately, in proposing tax increases only for the very rich, President Obama has denied the first of these fiscal truths, while Representative Paul D. Ryan, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, has contradicted the second by putting the entire burden of entitlement reform on the poor. The resulting squabble is not only deepening the fiscal stalemate, but also bringing us dangerously close to class war.
This lamentable prospect is deeply grounded in the policy-driven transformation of the economy during recent decades that has shifted income and wealth to the top of the economic ladder. While not the stated objective of policy, this reverse Robin Hood outcome cannot be gainsaid: the share of wealth held by the top 1 percent of households has risen to 35 percent from 21 percent since 1979, while their share of income has more than doubled to around 20 percent.
The culprit here was the combination of ultralow rates of interest at the Federal Reserve and ultralow rates of taxation on capital gains. The former destroyed the nation's capital markets, fueling huge growth in household and business debt, serial asset bubbles and endless leveraged speculation in equities, commodities, currencies and other assets.
At the same time, the nearly untaxed windfall gains accrued to pure financial speculators, not the backyard inventors envisioned by the Republican-inspired capital-gains tax revolution of 1978. And they happened in an environment of essentially zero inflation, the opposite of the double-digit inflation that justified a lower tax rate on capital gains back then -- but which is now simply an obsolete tax subsidy to the rich.
In attacking the Bush tax cuts for the top 2 percent of taxpayers, the president is only incidentally addressing the deficit. The larger purpose is to assure the vast bulk of Americans left behind that they will be spared higher taxes -- even though entitlements make a tax increase unavoidable. Mr. Obama is thus playing the class-war card more aggressively than any Democrat since Franklin D. Roosevelt -- surpassing Harry S. Truman or John F. Kennedy when they attacked big business or Lyndon B. Johnson or Jimmy Carter when they posed as champions of the little guy.
On the other side, Representative Ryan fails to recognize that we are not in an era of old-time enterprise capitalism in which the gospel of low tax rates and incentives to create wealth might have had relevance. A quasi-bankrupt nation saddled with rampant casino capitalism on Wall Street and a disemboweled, offshored economy on Main Street requires practical and equitable ways to pay its bills.
Ingratiating himself with the neo-cons, Mr. Ryan has put the $700 billion defense and security budget off limits; and caving to pusillanimous Republican politicians, he also exempts $17 trillion of Social Security and Medicare spending over the next decade. What is left, then, is $7 trillion in baseline spending for Medicaid and the social safety net -- to which Mr. Ryan applies a meat cleaver, reducing outlays by $1.5 trillion, or 20 percent.
Trapped between the religion of low taxes and the reality of huge deficits, the Ryan plan appears to be an attack on the poor in order to coddle the rich. To the Democrats' invitation to class war, the Republicans have seemingly sent an R.S.V.P.
Washington's feckless drift into class war is based on the illusion that we have endless time to put our fiscal house in order. This has instilled a terrible budgetary habit whereby politicians continuously duck concrete but politically painful near-term savings in favor of gimmicks like freezes, caps and block grants that push purely paper cuts into the distant, foggy future. Mr. Ryan's plan gets to a balanced budget in the fiscal afterlife (i.e., the 2030s); the White House's tactic of accumulating small-fry deficit cuts over the enormous span of 12 years amounts to the same dodge.
Such fiscal jabberwocky ignores the fact that we have experienced a recession every five years or so for the last six decades; that the budget is now exposed to even more frequent and amplified cyclical turbulence amid the aftershocks of the financial crisis; and that the United States does not have a divine right to issue any amount of interim debt that suits the ideological convenience of the two parties.
Nevertheless, the Democrats are immobilized because Keynesians insist on kicking the budgetary can down the road until cyclical "demand" has in their estimation fully recovered, while Republicans sit on their hands because supply-siders insist on letting the deficit fester until tax cuts work their alleged revenue magic.
A generation ago, such spurious ideological conceits would never have taken root, because deficits had adverse consequences like rising interest rates or an outflow of monetary reserves.
But for decades now, the central banks of the world have been giving policymakers a false signal that sovereign debt is cheap and limitless. Functioning like monetary roach motels, central banks have become a place where Treasury bonds go in but never come out -- thereby causing bond prices to be far higher and interest yields much lower than would obtain in a market that wasn't rigged.
Indeed, the Fed and currency-pegging central banks in East Asia and the Persian Gulf have absorbed nearly all of Uncle Sam's multitrillion-dollar spree of debt issuance. Moreover, about $4.6 trillion, or more than half of all debt held by the public, is now sequestered in central banks -- paid for with printing-press money.
Even central banks cannot defy the canons of sound finance indefinitely, however. Japan will buy less Treasury paper as it turns inward to recover from the wrath of nature. Likewise, China will drastically curtail its currency pegging and related Treasury bond purchases in order to suppress the rip-roaring imported inflation and speculative bubbles now engulfing its domestic economy. And unless the Fed wants to ruin the value of the dollar, it will need to keep its promise to get out of the bond-buying business, too, when its second round of quantitative easing ends in June.
With the central banks no longer ready to buy, the Treasury market will once again be driven by real investors -- many of them likely to demand higher interest rates owing to the heightened fiscal risks recently highlighted by Standard & Poor's. Ominously, the biggest and baddest of these real investors, the quarter-trillion-dollar Pimco Total Return Fund, has already thrown down the gauntlet by selling Uncle Sam's paper short.

INTEREST rates have been falling for 30 years, but Pimco's short call could well mark a generational reversal. If so, rates will continue to rise, and the fiscal time frame will be abruptly foreshortened from the distant foggy future to the Treasury's borrowing needs in the here and now. Then the abject deficiencies of the dueling budget plans will be self-evident.
By 2014, for example, the Ryan plan does not save a dime from the $2.2 trillion baseline for Social Security, Medicare and national security spending. Then it extends all the Bush tax cuts at a cost of $350 billion while instructing the states to reduce spending for the poor by $100 billion and the Congress to slice domestic discretionary spending by 25 percent. That toxic brew is likely to find few takers -- even at a Mad Hatter's tea party.
The latest iteration of the Obama plan is little better. By 2014, it would generate $70 billion from taxing the rich and perhaps $30 billion from the president's belated call to re-examine our over-financed military but virtually nothing from freezes on domestic programs or from Medicare reimbursement reforms.
So the Ryan plan worsens our trillion-dollar structural deficit and the Obama plan amounts to small potatoes, at best. Worse, we are about to descend into class war because the Obama plan picks on the rich when it should be pushing tax increases for all, while the Ryan plan attacks the poor when it should be addressing middle-class entitlements and defense.
In the real world, however, the global bond market is already rumbling -- and around the corner, a fiscal conflagration surely lies.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve's experimental effort to spur a recovery by purchasing vast quantities of federal debt has pumped up the stock market, reduced the cost of American exports and allowed companies to borrow money at lower interest rates.
But most Americans are not feeling the difference, in part because those benefits have been surprisingly small. The latest estimates from economists, in fact, suggest that the pace of recovery from the global financial crisis has flagged since November, when the Fed started buying $600 billion in Treasury securities to push private dollars into investments that create jobs.
As the Fed's policy-making board prepares to meet Tuesday and Wednesday -- after which the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, will hold a news conference for the first time to explain its decisions to the public -- a broad range of economists say that the disappointing results show the limits of the central bank's ability to lift the nation from its economic malaise.
"It's good for stopping the fall, but for actually turning things around and driving the recovery, I just don't think monetary policy has that power," said Mark Thoma, a professor of economics at the University of Oregon, referring specifically to the bond-buying program.
Mr. Bernanke and his supporters say that the purchases have improved economic conditions, all but erasing fears of deflation, a pattern of falling prices that can delay purchases and stall growth. Inflation, which is beneficial in moderation, has climbed closer to healthy levels since the Fed started buying bonds.
"These actions had the expected effects on markets and are thereby providing significant support to job creation and the economy," Mr. Bernanke said in a February speech, an argument he has repeated frequently.
But growth remains slow, jobs remain scarce, and with the debt purchases scheduled to end in June, the Fed must now decide what comes next.
The Fed generally encourages growth by pushing down interest rates. In normal times, it reduces short-term interest rates, and the effects spread to other kinds of borrowing like corporate bonds and mortgage loans. But with short-term rates hovering near zero since December 2008, the Fed has tried to attack long-term rates directly by entering the market and offering to accept lower returns.
The Fed limited the program to $600 billion under considerable political pressure. While that sounds like a lot of money, the purchases have not even kept pace with the government's issuance of new debt, so in a sense the effort has amounted to treading water. And a growing body of research suggests that the Fed could have had a larger impact by spending more money on a broader range of debt, like mortgage bonds, as it did initially.
A vocal group of critics, meanwhile, argues that the Fed has already done far too much, amassing a portfolio of more than $2 trillion that may impede the central bank's ability to raise interest rates to curb inflation. Some of these critics view the rising price of oil and other commodities as harbingers of broader price increases.
"I wasn't a big fan of it in the first place," said Charles I. Plosser, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and one of the 10 members of the Fed's policy-making board. "I didn't think it was going to have much of an impact, and it complicated the exit strategy. And what we've seen has not changed my mind."
The Fed's decision to buy bonds, known as quantitative easing, emulated Japan's central bank, which started buying bonds in 2001 to break a deflationary cycle.
The American version worked well at first. From November 2008 to March 2010, the Fed bought more than $1.7 trillion in mortgage and Treasury bonds, holding down mortgage rates and reducing borrowing costs for well-regarded companies by about half a percentage point, according to several studies. That is an annual savings of $5 million on every $1 billion borrowed.
As the economy sputtered last summer, Mr. Bernanke indicated in an August speech that the Fed would start a second round of quantitative easing, soon nicknamed QE 2. The initial response was the same: Asset prices rose, interest rates fell, and the dollar declined in value.
But in addition to being smaller, and solely focused on Treasuries, there also was a problem of diminishing returns. The first round of purchases reduced the cost of borrowing by persuading skittish investors to accept lower risk premiums. With markets closer to normalcy, Mr. Bernanke warned in his August speech that it was not clear that the Fed would have comparable success in persuading investors to accept even lower rates of return.
"Such purchases seem likely to have their largest effects during periods of economic and financial stress," he said.
The Fed says that its expectations were tempered by these realities, but that the program nonetheless has lowered yields on long-term Treasury bonds by about 0.2 percentage point relative to the rates investors would have demanded in the Fed's absence. That is about the same impact the central bank might have achieved by lowering its benchmark rate 0.75 percentage point, which in normal times would be an aggressive move.
But some economists say the new program has had a more limited impact on the broader economy than would a traditional cut in short-term interest rates. The Fed predicted that investors would be forced to buy other kinds of debt, reducing rates for other borrowers. But the supply of Treasuries available to investors has grown since November, as issuance of new government debt outpaced the Fed's purchases.
A study published in February found that interest rates decreased, but only for companies with top credit ratings. "Rates that are highly relevant for households and many corporations -- mortgage rates and rates on lower-grade corporate bonds -- were largely unaffected by the policy," wrote Arvind Krishnamurthy and Annette Vissing-Jorgensen, both finance professors at Northwestern University.
Another indication of its limited success: Borrowing has not grown significantly, suggesting that corporations -- which are sitting on record piles of cash -- are not yet seeing opportunities for new investments. Until they do, some economists argue that the Fed is pushing on a string.
"What has it done? It has eased credit conditions, it has pumped up the stock market, it has suppressed the dollar," said Mickey Levy, Bank of America's chief economist. "But does the Fed think that buying Treasuries and bloating its balance sheet is really going to create permanent job increases?"

Abstract: The price of gold has approximately doubled over the last two years as investors fret over inflation, political turmoil, currency risks and sovereign debt.

Full text: Deutsche Borse and NYSE Euronext shouldn't feel too proud of themselves for pulling around $145 million more of cost cuts from their magic merger hat. The increase might allow the German exchange to sweeten its offer to help fend off a higher joint bid from Nasdaq OMX and the IntercontinentalExchange. But it also suggests the NYSE and its partner grossly underestimated their aggressive rivals -- and perhaps other salient challenges.
In isolation, there is nothing wrong with revising the synergies companies expect to squeeze from a deal. Wary of the fallout from overpromising and underdelivering, plenty of companies agreeing to merge initially offer conservative estimates for removing overlapping operations and staff.
But such added juice usually shows up only after deals close. The NYSE and Deutsche Borse managed to find a sizable one-third more in promised cost cuts just weeks after announcing a merger they apparently spent months working on -- and for which they employed no fewer than eight high-price investment banks.
That adds to the impression the two were unprepared for the advances of the Nasdaq and ICE, and are scrambling to react. The Big Board's chief executive, Duncan Niederauer, has already publicly conceded that Deutsche Borse's boss, Reto Francioni, has not done the best job winning over NYSE shareholders.
Granted, the increased savings are still good news for fans of the trans-Atlantic tie-up. Once taxed, discounted and capitalized these could provide the German bourse with the wiggle room to add an extra $1 billion to its offer, significantly closing the gap to Nasdaq/ICE's offer.
But as Nasdaq/ICE is fond of pointing out, synergies from the NYSE-Euronext merger weren't as forthcoming as promised. And NYSE's ability to suddenly find so much more fat to trim adds weight to the aspersions the interlopers are casting about the two wannabe partners' management and cost-cutting skills.
More worrying for NYSE/Deutsche Borse is whether their complacency about the likelihood of a counteroffer extends to antitrust issues. If United States and European regulators don't share their views about increased concentration on securities exchanges, it could prove fatal for their deal.
Trade That Glitters
Barrick Gold has taken a shine to copper. The Canadian mining company jumped on Monday into the battle for Equinox, with a $7.7 billion bid that trumps one from China's Minmetals. It is a rich offer for a copper miner from a company that mainly promotes its gold credentials. Barrick's shift as the prices of both metals soar may not be the best use of resources.
It was gold that helped make 2010 Barrick's most profitable year in its 27-year history. That followed heavily trumpeted efforts in the second half of 2009 to position the company as a bigger wager on the yellow metal. It was then the gold producer tapped shareholders for $3 billion to remove its hedges, including by paying off fixed price contracts.
But copper has been on an even bigger tear. The price of gold has approximately doubled over the last two years as investors fret over inflation, political turmoil, currency risks and sovereign debt. Copper, meanwhile, has become a proxy investment on industrializing China and India, leading the price to roughly triple over the same span.
Barrick sees more room for copper to run. Buying Equinox would double its production of the metal and its percentage of nongold revenue to a fifth. The 30 percent premium Barrick is offering Equinox shareholders looks justifiable only if the market is "understating" copper assumptions as much as Barrick's boss, Aaron Regent, says it is.
The companies don't claim any cost savings from uniting. And Equinox already has enjoyed the full spoils of the metal's boom, with the company's shares keeping pace with the rise in copper prices. To overtake the rival Equinox bid, Barrick is offering a rich valuation compared with other recent mining deals of 7.1 times Ebitda. Minmetals could yet come back with an even higher price, which Barrick can match.
With gold at historically high prices, Barrick may be feeling flush. But copper prices are also at a peak. Barrick shareholders kicked in a year-and-a-half ago when the company wanted to become a purer play on gold. Returning that cash would have let them decide for themselves whether they were ready to change the bet.

Abstract: Housing prices slid back in February to their lowest level of the downturn, fresh proof -- as if any were needed -- that real estate remains one of the most troubled sectors of the economy. The Federal Housing Finance Agency's index, which is calculated using the purchase prices of houses with mortgages that have been sold to or guaranteed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, the government loan repositories, is declining at a faster rate than previously.

Full text: Housing prices slid back in February to their lowest level of the downturn, fresh proof -- as if any were needed -- that real estate remains one of the most troubled sectors of the economy.
The Standard & Poor's Case-Shiller Home Price Index for 20 metropolitan areas dropped 1.1 percent from January, S.& P. said Tuesday.
By the barest of margins, the index failed to plumb new depths. It is now at 139.27, essentially the same as the low of 139.26 that it reached in April 2009.
Housing prices are falling even though banks have been pulling back on foreclosures, which generally drive neighborhood prices down. They are falling despite low interest rates, which make houses more affordable. And they are falling even though they have already dropped by a third from their heady peaks in mid-decade.
"It looks pretty bad," the chairman of the S.& P. index committee, David M. Blitzer, said. "Could it get a little worse? Sure. Could it get a whole lot worse, so everywhere looks the way Detroit looks now? To get there, you'd have to paint a really, really grim picture."
Another devastating recession, perhaps? Potential buyers scorning en masse the notion of ownership? Mr. Blitzer does not see those happening.
This will be small comfort for anyone trying to sell in this environment, or merely wondering where the money for retirement will come from. Washington was the only Case-Shiller city where prices went up over the last year. But even it dropped slightly in February. Ten of the cities in the index, including Atlanta, Charlotte, Chicago, New York and Seattle, hit a low for the cycle during the month. That was one fewer than January.
Detroit was the exception. Why Detroit, by far the worst housing market in the country, rose when everywhere else was sliding is a statistical mystery.
For the 20 cities, prices are down 3.3 percent in the last 12 months. That is not much compared to the precipitous drops of 2008 and 2009 but some see the declines accelerating.
Capital Economics, a forecasting group in Toronto, previously said prices would drop about 5 percent this year. "That forecast is looking increasingly realistic," Paul Dales, a senior United States economist, wrote in a note to clients.
Another 5 percent decline in the index would take it back to about 133. While that equates to a 33 percent gain for homeowners since 2000, it is just about nothing after inflation is factored in. And those would be the lucky ones, who bought long ago.
Most economists think the market is in transition to something resembling stability, although few expect genuine price increases anytime soon.
"Things are moving in the direction of getting better," said Eric Fox, vice president for statistical and economic modeling for the consultant Veros.
Among the helpful trends: The oversupply of houses that characterized the early stages of the downturn is gradually being absorbed, the employment situation is marginally better and interest rates are not increasing.
Veros is forecasting that stronger markets, including Pittsburgh, Buffalo and Shreveport, La., will increase 2 to 3 percent over the next year, while the weakest markets will fall about 5 percent. Weak markets include Las Vegas, Orlando, Fla., and Portland, Ore.
"Foreclosures are the big unknown," Mr. Fox said. "If there is a huge influx, that can have an effect."
The Case-Shiller index, which measures repeat sales of houses, is an imperfect measure of the real estate market. The index is a three-month moving average, so the February results include December and January.
Other indexes also describe a troubled market, however. The Federal Housing Finance Agency's index, which is calculated using the purchase prices of houses with mortgages that have been sold to or guaranteed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, the government loan repositories, is declining at a faster rate than previously.
The F.H.F.A. index fell 1.6 percent in February from the previous month, the agency said last week, while the January decline was revised up to 1 percent. In the last year, the index has fallen nearly 6 percent.
If some troubled owners are beginning to reject the notion of homeownership, a few renters are sensing this might be their moment.
"Talking about how the recession is bad for home builders and sellers ignores an entire segment of the country for whom this is a blessing," said Abby Eagye, 41.
A writer, skiing instructor and emergency medical worker, Ms. Eagye lives in Aspen, Colo., where the wealthy roam. But the crash has yielded some surprising deals. Ms. Eagye is pulling together a down payment.
"I missed the real estate window once and I don't care to do it again," she said. "I have no false dreams of flipping homes to make money. I just want the safety of owning my own home."

Full text: Washington
On Wednesday at 2:15 p.m., Ben Bernanke will do something that previous Federal Reserve chairmen considered a terrible idea. He will hold a news conference.
Mr. Bernanke spent much of his academic career arguing that the Fed should be less opaque, and, as chairman, he has put his ideas into action. Now it's time for those of us in the media to hold up our end of bargain. In the spirit of democratic accountability, we should ask hard questions -- and we shouldn't let him get away with the evasions and half-answers that members of Congress too often allow Fed chairmen during their appearances on Capitol Hill.
One question more than any than other is crying out for an answer: Why has Mr. Bernanke decided to accept widespread unemployment for years on end, even though he believes he has the power to reduce it?
The Fed's own forecasts suggest that the unemployment rate won't fall below 5 percent for perhaps another five or six years. Mr. Bernanke believes the Fed "retains considerable power" to reduce unemployment faster, despite the fact that its benchmark interest rate is zero, as he's said before. Yet he has been hesitant to use that power.
He is in a tough spot, to be fair. Several other voting members of the Fed's monetary policy committee -- and some prominent members of Congress -- oppose aggressive action, because they worry it will set off inflation. But these critics always worry about inflation. They have been wrong again and again over the last two years. More important, they don't have enough power to keep Mr. Bernanke from pursuing the policy he thinks is best.
So the Fed's decision to permit high unemployment for an extended period rests on his shoulders.
As he has explained many times, the Fed has alternatives. It could announce that it would keep its benchmark rate at zero for a few years, which would probably hold down long-term rates. It could say that it was comfortable with higher inflation for a limited period of time, given how low inflation has been since 2007 and how high unemployment is. Above all, Mr. Bernanke could make clear that he considers years of widespread unemployment to be unacceptable.
He has not done so, and he has yet to offer a satisfying rationale.
Instead, he has said that more aggressive action brings risks. And it does. Low interest rates have the potential to spark inflation, by enticing millions of households and businesses to borrow money and causing the economy to overheat. Higher inflation could, among other things, increase borrowing rates for the United States government and worsen the deficit.
But it's worth keeping in mind that just about every decision involves some risk. Simply stating that more aggressive action brings risks is not a good argument against that option.
Economists sometimes like to describe choices in terms of a concept known as expected value. The expected value of a decision is the odds of each possible outcome multiplied by the benefit (or cost) of that outcome. If you make an investment that has a 90 percent of breaking even and a 10 percent chance of earning you $5,000, the expected value is $500.
Now extend this concept to the Fed's decision. The consequences of being too aggressive and creating an inflationary spiral are undeniably serious. But the odds still appear quite low. Put the two together, and you get an expected cost that is not high enough to be dictating Fed policy.
One of the best guides to future inflation is recent core inflation -- that is, inflation excluding food and energy prices, which bounce around a lot and often do not translate into big changes in other prices. Despite the uptick in core inflation, it has still risen at an annual pace of only 2 percent over the last three months. On only a few other occasions over the last 40 years has it been so low.
This shouldn't be surprising. After all, does the economy feel as if it's on the verge of overheating?
The expected cost of high unemployment, on the other hand, is steep. For one thing, the chances that unemployment will remain a problem are close to 100 percent. The debate is whether the country will return to full employment in four years or 10 years.
For another, the consequences of high unemployment are also awful. With fewer jobs, states and cities are short of tax revenue. Families lose their life savings. People's health can deteriorate. For the long-term unemployed, the financial damage can be permanent. "If things go on and they simply sit at home or work very irregularly," Mr. Bernanke himself said last year, "when the economy gets back to a more normal state, they're not going to be able to find good work."
Unemployment creates political problems, too. Historically, it has tended to make voters less willing to help their fellow citizens, as the economist Benjamin Friedman has written. It's hard to imagine any grand political compromise -- on the deficit, for instance -- in an angry country.
Mr. Bernanke is an admirable public official in many ways. He was calmly heroic during the worst days of the financial crisis. By making the Fed more open, he has taken the rarest of steps for a political figure: voluntarily giving up some of his power.
Nonetheless, his job performance over the last year or so has been flawed. The Fed badly overestimated the economy's strength in 2010 and took too long to correct its mistake. Despite his core belief in letting facts guide decisions, Mr. Bernanke has let himself be overly influenced by a group of colleagues who see inflation always and everywhere as a threat and unemployment as a mere nuisance.
The news conference on Wednesday offers a chance to hold him accountable. The country's leading Fed scholar -- one Ben Bernanke, formerly of Princeton -- would expect nothing less.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, on Wednesday conducted the first scheduled press conference in the central bank's history, sitting behind a mahogany desk as cameras clicked and flashed. Mr. Bernanke explained his management of the economy in the calm, patient and serious manner of the college professor that he used to be.
He mostly retraced familiar ground, and the markets rose only slightly as he spoke, suggesting that investors learned little of consequence, although the three major indexes ended the day strongly. The news was in the spectacle of a Fed chairman addressing public concerns on live television.
The central bank, so careful for so long to cultivate a sense that it was above politics, will now hold regular news conferences just like so many others in Washington, hoping to improve its image and build support for its policies.
Mr. Bernanke's message Wednesday was that the Fed was doing all it could to spur growth and increase employment without causing inflation to rise. He said that inflation must take precedence over employment because inflation would result in job losses.
"While it is very, very important to help the economy create jobs and help to support the recovery, I think every central banker understands that keeping inflation low is absolutely essential to a successful economy, and we will do what we can to make sure that happens," he said.
He spoke after the Fed lowered its projections for domestic economic growth in 2011, predicting growth of 3.1 to 3.3 percent. In January, the Fed had predicted growth of 3.4 to 3.9 percent, but Mr. Bernanke said that exports, construction spending and military spending had all been lower than expected.
The Fed also raised its forecast of inflation, projecting that prices could rise 2.1 to 2.8 percent this year, mostly because of higher oil prices, although it stressed that those increases would subside.
The Fed's policy-making committee voted unanimously on Wednesday to continue several policies intended to stimulate growth, including holding short-term interest rates near zero, and keeping the size of the Fed's investment portfolio at more than $2 trillion once the scheduled purchase of $600 billion in Treasury securities ends in June.
"Increases in the prices of energy and other commodities have pushed up inflation in recent months.," the statement said. "The committee expects these effects to be transitory, but it will pay close attention to the evolution of inflation and inflation expectations."
Mr. Bernanke said that the recovery had become self-sustaining, meaning that growth could continue even without extraordinary government support, but he added that he still wanted to see a faster pace of growth and more job creation.
The government's official unemployment rate -- the share of the labor force actively seeking jobs -- remains at very high levels, although it fell to 8.8 percent in March from 10.1 percent in late 2009. Moreover, the unemployment rate would be more than twice as high if the government chose to include the large numbers of Americans who had stopped looking for work or accepted part-time jobs.
Mr. Bernanke cautioned that if the economy did falter, it could prove difficult for the central bank to provide fresh support because of growing inflationary pressures.
"The trade-offs are getting harder at this point," Mr. Bernanke said. "Inflation is getting higher. It's not clear that we can get substantial improvements in payrolls" without creating a considerable risk of a dangerous rise in inflation.
Mr. Bernanke spoke on the top floor of an annex behind the Federal Reserve's headquarters. The Fed allowed about 60 print and broadcast reporters to attend, passing them through heavy security and escorting them to assigned seats at long rows of tables. At the front were two flags and the mahogany desk.
The questions reflected the difficulty of the choices the Fed now faces. Some reporters pressed Mr. Bernanke to explain why he was not more concerned about inflation. Others asked why he was not more concerned about unemployment.
When Mr. Bernanke testifies before Congress, he often faces questions about a wide range of issues -- and sometimes issues that have little to do with economics -- but on Wednesday the questions stayed focused on the compact and complicated world of monetary policy. Mr. Bernanke responded in kind, offering technical answers that at times may have passed beyond the reach of any casual viewers.
The Fed's hope in part is to reach the broader public, to address widespread anger over the central bank's extraordinary response to the financial crisis by building public understanding of its actions. But the Fed also wants to speak more clearly to an audience of specialists and investors who hang on its every word.
In particular, by speaking immediately after the committee meets, Mr. Bernanke may create a reference point for investors confused by the cacophony of contradictory speeches given by other members of the policy-making committee in the wake of each meeting.
The Fed said Wednesday that it would maintain short-term rates near zero "for an extended period" -- which Mr. Bernanke defined as meaning that there would be no changes for several meetings. The committee meets eight times each year.
Critics of the Fed's position on inflation argue that higher commodity prices will push up the price of other goods and services. But Mr. Bernanke and his allies consider it more likely that the higher prices will force Americans to reduce consumption, because wages are not rising and therefore Americans do not have more money to spend. As demand drops, they say, the price of food, oil and other commodities will also fall.
Fed officials emphasize that they are concerned about the price of food and oil. But they say that best way to keep those prices stable over the long term is to ignore short-term fluctuations.
The decision by the committee was once again unanimous, despite public speeches by some members expressing misgivings that the Fed is underestimating the risks of inflation. So far, however, the most vocal critics -- Charles I. Plosser, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, and Richard W. Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas -- have not registered their concerns in the form of dissenting votes.
The committee next meets June 21-22.

Full text: SHANGHAI -- For years, China's export juggernaut has been fed by highly efficient factories, low-cost labor and a fleet of container ships capable of transporting huge volumes of toys, textiles, electronics and other goods to every corner of the world.
But there is a surprisingly weak link in the Made in China chain.
Moving those goods from the factory floor to one of China's enormous seaports -- often a drive of less than two hours -- typically means relying on an independent trucking company. And as vital as trucking is to China's mighty export machine, the government seems to be ignoring the drawbacks of what analysts say is an increasingly disorganized, inefficient and even costly way to transport factory goods to seaports.
Trucking's tenuous status has been underscored by recent protests and demonstrations by drivers. Last week, in an unusually bold display of public anger, 2,000 truckers went on strike in Shanghai to complain about the rising cost of fuel and unfair government transportation fees. Some protestors hurled rocks, tried to overturn police cars and smashed the windshields of truck drivers who refused to join the strike.
The Shanghai municipal government eventually ended the three-day strike by arresting protestors and threatening strike organizers, while also promising to lower some fees that trucking companies must pay to use the roads and seaport.
But the challenges that trucking pose to China's $1.5 trillion a year in exports are still in place -- and could become even greater, now that huge factories have begun relocating to poorer, inland regions to save on labor costs.
"Our concern is that as these factories move away from the coast, the service standards won't keep pace," said Ken Glenn, an executive at APL, a transportation services company. "Rail and barge are even less developed."
Within China, thousands of small trucking companies, many of them family-owned, compete by promising low-cost delivery. Then they overload their 18-wheelers in dangerous ways, pay bribes to ward off highway inspectors and hope to eke out tiny profits.
Now, though, with global oil prices sending the cost of fuel soaring, many truckers say they are heading toward bankruptcy.
"We're paying a lot more money for fuel than we did three years ago, but what we get paid for freight has stayed the same," said Qi Zhenwei, a truck owner stationed at a dusty trucking depot near one of Shanghai's busiest ports. "How am I supposed to survive?"
Mark Millar, a China logistics expert at M Power Associates in Hong Kong, sees Chinese trucking as "a seriously fragmented and brutally competitive industry."
"Most of the drivers are owner-operators, and in order to make money, they carry more cargo than the truck is supposed to hold," Mr. Millar said. "This is obviously not a healthy model."
Not all trucking in China is such a seat-of-the-pants affair. Some global companies transport goods by truck in sealed shipping containers from factory to dock, sometimes accompanied by security escorts.
But more often, goods destined for export are delivered to seaports by small trucking companies -- usually hired by logistics firms that bargain to get the lowest possible shipping price. To scrape by, many of the small trucking firms violate the law, pay bribes to avoid heavy fines and transportation restrictions, and even force drivers to sleep in the trucks overnight, sometimes in insecure parking lots.
These rigors might seem to contradict the heavy investment in infrastructure and expressways that China has made to make its transportation network more efficient.
But many of this country's modern roadways are expensive toll roads. And the government has placed tough regulations on many aspects of the transportation industry, which analysts say have burdened companies with heavy taxes, insurance and government fees. As a result, transporting goods by truck in China is relatively more expensive than doing so in the United States.
According to the American Trucking Associations, moving goods by truck in the United States costs about $1.75 per mile. That includes driver salaries, truck leases, insurance, tolls and many other related costs.
By comparison, trucking costs in China's two biggest export regions -- the Yangtze River Delta region near Shanghai and the Pearl River Delta around Hong Kong -- are $2.50 to $3 a mile. That is despite low pay to Chinese drivers, who might earn only 25 cents an hour, versus about $17 an hour in the United States.
Corruption is also a major problem. Chinese truck drivers say highway and port inspectors routinely demand payoffs or bribes. Drivers who refuse to pay may find themselves hit by large fines for even the smallest infraction. (That many of the trucks are overweight makes them ripe for sanctions.) Some regions even operate illegal toll booths.
Rachel Katz, a Fulbright research fellow from the United States who is spending a year in China traveling with long-haul truck drivers, says the drivers are constantly harassed by highway officials.
"There's every kind of fine you can imagine," she said in a telephone interview from Chengdu, in southwest China. "There are many different people regulating the roads and finding a way to tax the truckers. I can't believe the system operates this way."
Ms. Katz recalls one driver telling her: "In the U.S., you issue tickets in order to control traffic. In China, we control traffic in order to issue tickets."
Truck drivers do not get much sympathy from their clients -- factory bosses who are also struggling to cope with inflation. With labor and raw material and energy prices soaring here, factories are reluctant to pay higher fees to move goods to the major ports.
Besides, many of the factory bosses seem to recognize that there is an oversupply of small trucking companies desperate for cargo.
"They face a situation of absolutely cutthroat competition, and many of them are not well educated," said Tyrrell Duncan, a transportation director at the Asian Development Bank. "There aren't programs to train them."
Qi Zhenwei, who is 35, and his 31-year-old brother, Qi Erwei, are typical trucking bosses working in Shanghai's bustling Baoshan port district.
Despite fears of government reprisals, they agreed to talk this week in the rusted metal container that now serves as a lounge at their dusty truck depot, amid engine parts and a bucket filled with cigarette butts. Between phone calls and dashes in and out of the makeshift lounge to talk to colleagues, they told their story.
Until about seven years ago, they were peasant farmers struggling to make a living in Henan Province, one of the country's poorest regions. Neither of them had finished high school.
They traveled more than 500 miles east to Shanghai and found work as truck drivers. ("I once went 24 consecutive days without sleeping in a bed," Qi Zhenwei said.) Eventually, they earned enough to combine their savings with $100,000 they borrowed from some friends and relatives to buy their own fleet of five new and used Chinese-made trucks.
But shortly after they invested in some of their most expensive vehicles, the global financial crisis struck. Exports plummeted, devastating their container hauling business. A year later, in 2009, when China's exports began to rebound, so did inflation and fuel prices. And now, the brothers are faced with greater competition from a growing number of small trucking companies.
"So far, I didn't make any money," Qi Zhenwei complained.
The brothers refused to talk about the recent strike here, saying the government had been visiting all truckers in the area. But they freely discussed their costs: tire fees, insurance, driver salaries, road use fees, oil changes, repairs and even fees that trucks pay to enter the city.
"If I had a chance to sell the truck, I'd get out of the business," the older brother said, dejectedly smoking a cigarette. "I'd go back to my hometown. Now, people there are planting crops for Chinese medicine. And they're making good money."

Abstract: A steel analyst I have trusted for many years, Michelle Applebaum, the managing partner of Steel Market Intelligence, an equity research firm, cautioned me against leaping to conclusions, but added that if the decline in Chinese prices continued, "then, of course, it would be indicative that their rate of growth is slowing." [...] by tying the renminbi to the dollar, China has effectively turned over its monetary policy to Mr. Bernanke and his colleagues, whose dual mandate of promoting American growth and fighting American inflation says nothing about stopping China from overheating.

Full text: The American economic revival stumbled in early 2011. Could that be more than the "transitory" phenomenon that Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, called it at his news conference this week?
It makes sense to think the pause in growth will be temporary. Part of the first-quarter slowdown was caused by a weakness in the growth rate of exports that should not endure as developing economies continue to expand. There was also severe weather, which if anything should accelerate second-quarter growth with catch-up spending. And military spending declined.
With all those things, the economy grew at a 1.8 percent annual rate, according to the first estimate released by the government on Thursday.
To make the case for a rebound even stronger, the commentary from companies reporting first-quarter earnings has generally been upbeat. They are continuing to see sales rise, and profits are looking good. They are more awash in cash than ever, and many of them say they plan to hire more American workers. The recent surprise in unemployment numbers has been in how rapidly they fell.
This week, even as the Fed was lowering its forecast for economic growth in 2011, it was also lowering its expectations for unemployment. It had no choice. Back in January the consensus among Fed officials was that the unemployment rate would be 8.8 to 9 percent in the final quarter of 2011. It has already fallen to 8.8 percent, and the new consensus, of 8.4 to 8.7 percent, could be far too pessimistic if companies mean what they say about hiring.
But there could be a sign of possible problems in, of all places, China.
China's steel prices, which had been rising rapidly, started to slide in mid-February. They bounced back for a week after the earthquake and tsunami in Japan, but have slipped since then.
What does that mean? Maybe nothing. China's steel market is a wondrous combination of socialism and capitalism. Chinese steel is mostly sold through markets where prices can bounce wildly, and traders seek to profit from volatility. There are few good statistics on such basic things as inventories, making markets nervous about any change in direction. The producers are mostly government-owned companies, often managed by local governments more interested in jobs than profits. (Can you imagine such a thing in a developed economy?)
So Chinese steel statistics must be approached with caution.
One interpretation of the slipping prices is that the pre-tsunami decline was just market noise, and that the decline since then represents a correct analysis that Japan will be importing a lot less steel as manufacturing is interrupted by parts shortages. There is talk that the Japanese economy will shrink at a rate of 5 to 8 percent in the second quarter.
A steel analyst I have trusted for many years, Michelle Applebaum, the managing partner of Steel Market Intelligence, an equity research firm, cautioned me against leaping to conclusions, but added that if the decline in Chinese prices continued, "then, of course, it would be indicative that their rate of growth is slowing." China, she said, is "growing in a very steel-intensive way."
That is a prospect that should make the world at least a little nervous. China grew at an annual rate of 9.7 percent in the first quarter, according to official statistics. Europe, meanwhile, seems determined to impose austerity and debt reduction at the same time the European Central Bank raises interest rates.
Think of China as the primary engine of world growth and Europe as a brake. The world may not grow much if that engine starts to stutter before the old primary engine -- the United States -- starts to rev up.
China's government keeps vowing to do something to slow its inflation, and has been trying to discourage credit growth and reduce the volume of new construction projects. In the West, there has been general disbelief that it could possibly succeed. After all, by tying the renminbi to the dollar, China has effectively turned over its monetary policy to Mr. Bernanke and his colleagues, whose dual mandate of promoting American growth and fighting American inflation says nothing about stopping China from overheating.
China's economy may well not be slowing. Perhaps the steel figures represent government efforts to hold down reported inflation by putting pressure on producers, a la President John F. Kennedy and United States Steel in 1962. But all good things come to an end, and someday China's growth rate will slow. By then, the world may no longer need the help. But it does now.
The Fed has been doing everything it can to stimulate the American economy, but has been rewarded for its efforts with denunciations. Liberals gripe that it is not doing enough to bring down unemployment. Conservatives complain that it is encouraging inflation by printing money. To hear some of them tell it, Mr. Bernanke is a member of the Obama administration who is destroying the currency to help the president win re-election.
That is not how you would expect conservatives to view a man who used to be chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under George W. Bush, but these days many Republicans view Mr. Bush as something of a heretic for raising government spending.
Monetary policy is clearly on hold now. Mr. Bernanke may or may not think it is a good idea to end the Fed's purchases of longer-term Treasuries -- the program known as QE2, for quantitative easing. But he had no choice, given the political realities.
The Fed is caught in a bind, with inflation rising and growth perhaps slowing. "A surge in commodity prices unavoidably impairs performance with respect to both aspects of the Federal Reserve's dual mandate," Janet L. Yellin, the Fed's vice chairwoman, pointed out in her talk to the Economic Club of New York earlier this month. "Such shocks push up unemployment and raise inflation. A policy easing might alleviate the effects on employment but would tend to exacerbate the inflationary effects; conversely, policy firming might mitigate the rise in inflation but would contribute to an even weaker economic recovery."
For much of the last two years, growth in federal government spending helped. But now, that spending is falling. And state and local government spending, adjusted for inflation, is at its lowest level in nine years.
The American outlook would be much worse if there really was much chance of a rapid reduction in government spending, as the politicians say they want. With the recovery stumbling, tighter monetary and fiscal policy could be disastrous. But it is probable that there will be no deal and that after a new episode of "The Perils of Pauline," the debt ceiling will be raised and a temporary deal worked out that makes no one happy.
The risk is that if things do get worse, perhaps because that fall in Chinese steel prices really does mean something, the government will be impotent. Stalemate could keep fiscal policy in neutral or worse, and political pressures could prevent any monetary easing until it is far too late to prevent a new downturn.
Let's hope that Mr. Bernanke is right to think both the slow growth rate of the first quarter and the rise in inflation are transitory phenomena.

Abstract: The Fed normally takes primary responsibility for short-term economic management, using its influence over interest rates to cool the economy when it's running too hot, which raises the threat of inflation, and to heat it up when it's running too cold, leading to high unemployment. True, the Fed expects inflation this year to run a bit above target, but Mr. Bernanke declared (and I agree) that we're looking at a temporary bulge from higher raw material prices; measures of underlying inflation remain well below target, and the forecast sees inflation falling sharply next year and remaining low at least through 2013.

Full text: Last month more than 14 million Americans were unemployed by the official definition -- that is, seeking work but unable to find it. Millions more were stuck in part-time work because they couldn't find full-time jobs. And we're not talking about temporary hardship. Long-term unemployment, once rare in this country, has become all too normal: More than four million Americans have been out of work for a year or more.
Given this dismal picture, you might have expected unemployment, and what to do about it, to have been a major focus of Wednesday's press conference with Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve. And it should have been. But it wasn't.
After the conference, Reuters put together a "word cloud" of Mr. Bernanke's remarks, a visual representation of the frequency with which he used various words. The cloud is dominated by the word "inflation." "Unemployment," in much smaller type, is tucked in the background.
This misplaced emphasis wasn't entirely Mr. Bernanke's fault, since he was responding to questions -- and those questions focused much more on inflation than on unemployment. But that focus was, in itself, a symptom of the extent to which Washington has lost interest in the plight of the unemployed. And the Bernanke Fed, which should be taking a firm stand against these skewed priorities, is instead letting itself be bullied into following the herd.
Some background: The Fed normally takes primary responsibility for short-term economic management, using its influence over interest rates to cool the economy when it's running too hot, which raises the threat of inflation, and to heat it up when it's running too cold, leading to high unemployment. And the Fed has more or less explicitly indicated what it considers a Goldilocks outcome, neither too hot nor too cold: inflation at 2 percent or a bit lower, unemployment at 5 percent or a bit higher.
But Goldilocks has left the building, and shows no sign of returning soon. The Fed's latest forecasts, unveiled at that press conference, show low inflation and high unemployment for the foreseeable future.
True, the Fed expects inflation this year to run a bit above target, but Mr. Bernanke declared (and I agree) that we're looking at a temporary bulge from higher raw material prices; measures of underlying inflation remain well below target, and the forecast sees inflation falling sharply next year and remaining low at least through 2013.
Meanwhile, as I've already pointed out, unemployment -- although down from its 2009 peak -- remains devastatingly high. And the Fed expects only slow improvement, with unemployment at the end of 2013 expected to still be around 7 percent.
It all adds up to a clear case for more action. Yet Mr. Bernanke indicated that he has done all he's likely to do. Why?
He could have argued that he lacks the ability to do more, that he and his colleagues no longer have much traction over the economy. But he didn't. On the contrary, he argued that the Fed's recent policy of buying long-term bonds, generally referred to as "quantitative easing," has been effective. So why not do more?
Mr. Bernanke's answer was deeply disheartening. He declared that further expansion might lead to higher inflation.
What you need to bear in mind here is that the Fed's own forecasts say that inflation will be below target over the next few years, so that some rise in inflation would actually be a good thing, not a reason to avoid tackling unemployment. Those forecasts could, of course, be wrong, but they could be too high as well as too low.
The only way to make sense of Mr. Bernanke's aversion to further action is to say that he's deathly afraid of overshooting the inflation target, while being far less worried about undershooting -- even though doing too little means condemning millions of Americans to the nightmare of long-term unemployment.
What's going on here? My interpretation is that Mr. Bernanke is allowing himself to be bullied by the inflationistas: the people who keep seeing runaway inflation just around the corner and are undeterred by the fact that they keep on being wrong.
Lately the inflationistas have seized on rising oil prices as evidence in their favor, even though -- as Mr. Bernanke himself pointed out -- these prices have nothing to do with Fed policy. The way oil prices are coloring the discussion led the economist Tim Duy to suggest, sarcastically, that basic Fed policy is now to do nothing about unemployment "because some people in the Middle East are seeking democracy."
But I'd put it differently. I'd say that the Fed's policy is to do nothing about unemployment because Ron Paul is now the chairman of the House subcommittee on monetary policy.
So much for the Fed's independence. And so much for the future of America's increasingly desperate jobless.

Full text: American economic expansion slowed to a crawl in the first quarter, but economists are hopeful that the setback will be temporary. Total output grew at an annual rate of 1.8 percent from January through March, the Commerce Department said Thursday, after expanding at a 3.1 percent pace in the fourth quarter of 2010.
When the year began, economists expected a more robust growth rate of about 4 percent, only to be barraged by bad report after bad report. Turmoil in the Middle East led to higher oil prices, which had already been climbing because of increased demand in emerging markets like China. Housing sales dropped sharply. Winter blizzards closed businesses and delayed construction, causing investments in nonresidential structures like office buildings to fall 21.7 percent from the previous quarter. Imports, which are subtracted from gross domestic product, surged. Military spending sank.
Economists say many of these problems will fade later in the year and economic growth will hasten through the spring. Last quarter's dismal news was, fingers crossed, "a pause, not a trend," said Kathy Bostjancic, director for macroeconomic analysis at the Conference Board.
The American public seems less certain.
Every time the economy has appeared to be on the verge of taking off, prospects have been thwarted by troubles at home (like housing) and abroad (like the European debt crises last year). As a result, Americans seem to be tiring of predictions that things will pick up "soon." A Gallup poll released Thursday found that 29 percent of Americans believed the economy was in a depression.
"The G.D.P. went up, and that's all fine and good, but in the real marketplace that's definitely not the case," said Jeff Beatty, a 62-year-old information technology professional in Richmond, Ky. Despite applying for 214 jobs "across half of the country," he said, he has been unable to find work for the last year.
To some extent these frustrations, and false starts in the economy, may have been predictable. Historical research by the economists Carmen and Vincent Reinhart has shown that economic recoveries after financial crises are always fragile and painfully slow. So even though the work-stopping blizzards of winter have passed, and export growth looks likely to pick up again, other obstacles may rock the remainder of the year.
Of these various economic menaces, the most threatening is higher commodity prices, which reduce the amount of money that households and businesses have available to spend on other purchases and, in the case of companies, additional employees. Crude oil prices have risen 32 percent over the last three months and have shown little sign of falling in recent weeks. These increases, along with those on food and other goods, have nearly neutralized the 2011 payroll tax cuts that were intended as a stimulus.
"For rising prices of oil and gasoline, the main place it hurts the economy is the pain it puts on consumers, and we continue to monitor that impact," said Austan Goolsbee, chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers. He said he expected consumer spending to continue growing apace, however.
Declines in government spending will probably remain a drag on the economy throughout the year, as state and local governments cut back and the federal government tries to cut spending over all. Last quarter's steep drop in military spending, a category that tends to be volatile, will probably reverse itself later in the year, economists said.
Investors largely shrugged off the report for the last quarter, with stock prices little changed on the day.
The main sources of strength last quarter were greater inventories on stockroom shelves and more business spending on equipment and software. Equipment and software purchases have grown for eight consecutive quarters and have only recently been accompanied by hiring strong enough to lower the unemployment rate.
At an unprecedented news conference on Wednesday, the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, addressed concerns about sluggish growth so far this year.
"Most of the slowdown in the first quarter is viewed by the committee as being transitory," Mr. Bernanke said, referring to the opinions of the Fed's Federal Open Market Committee, which sets interest rates. "That being said, we've taken our forecast down just a bit, taking into account factors like weaker construction and possibly just a bit less momentum in the economy."
Several economic reports in recent weeks have been relatively optimistic, including industrial production, corporate earnings and -- finally -- job growth. The nation's employers added 216,000 jobs in March, the fastest growth since last spring, when the federal government temporarily increased hiring for the decennial census. The job growth this year has been spread through almost every sector.
"The broad set of labor market indicators still look good," said Andrew Tilton, a senior economist at Goldman Sachs, which is forecasting that the economy will accelerate and expand at a 4 percent annual rate in the second quarter.
Still, given the ground lost during the recession, the economy has a long way to go before its job market and output are feeling healthy again. There are some fears that the slow expansion in the first quarter may weigh on job growth, since employment trends tend to lag whatever happens in the rest of the economy.
"Payroll growth may have a temporary wobble," said Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics. "This is not a fundamental shift in the path of recovery but maybe a temporary distortion."
Economists played down the economic threat to the United States from Japan's deadly earthquake and tsunami in March.
"It only happened at the very end of the quarter, and any disruptions to supply chains would take a few weeks to come through," said Paul Dales, a senior United States economist at Capital Economics. "If there's any effect, it'll happen in the second quarter, but the impact should be minimal."

You often hear people in their 60s, 70s and even 80s say that the house they lived in for 30 years was the best investment they ever made. Given what we recently went through in the housing market that can be hard to believe. But they're probably right; it's just not for the reason you think.
For the last 120 years, housing prices barely kept pace with inflation. The last 30 years haven't been any better, once you include the ugly numbers from the last five or six years. So how could an asset that barely kept pace with inflation be the best investment someone ever made?
Let's start with how we used to look at houses. After World War II, the United States saw a huge increase in home ownership. From 1940 to 1960 home ownership increased from 43 percent to 62 percent of Americans.
You know these people. For some of you, they were your parents, and for others, they were your grandparents. You went there for Thanksgiving and other holidays. These houses were homes, not investments. Nobody thought about what they were worth every day, month or even decade. You just lived there.
But no more. It's almost gotten to the point where I expect to see a quote for my home on Yahoo Finance every morning. The Web site Zillow has come pretty close to being able to provide that.
A few years ago, investing in real estate, including the house you lived in, became America's favorite spectator sport, with most of us either joining in or wishing we could. If you look again at the chart of home values over the years that I linked to above, it looks just as scary and volatile as the stock market.
But in the past no one knew they were supposed to be scared while they lived in their house. The only time you cared about the real estate market, such as it was, was when you needed to move.
So part of the reason people who lived in the same house for 30 years claim their home was their best investment comes from it probably being the only investment they actually held for 30 years. The power of compound interest, even if the return is just over inflation, is amazing, but only if you actually let it compound.
For comparison, look at stock mutual funds, which are meant to be held for a long time but often are not. According to the research firm Dalbar, the average investor holds on to their mutual fund for just over three years.
Three years versus 30 years may go a long way to explaining why people may say that their home has been their best investment. It's not because real estate has delivered a fantastic return; it's simply because of the decision they made to sit tight in that four-bedroom asset.
So in the end this consideration of the best investment isn't about the relative merits of real estate. It's about behavior. The question to ask yourself, then, is this: 30 years from now, what will be your best investment?
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

China Allows Currency to Rise Further Against Dollar

Full text: HONG KONG -- The Chinese currency hit a milestone Friday by rising beyond a level closely watched by analysts -- the strongest since Beijing began allowing the currency, the renminbi, to rise in 2005 and a sign that the authorities might be using the appreciation as a weapon against inflation.
The dollar fell below 6.50 renminbi to about 6.491. That marks a 5 percent gain for the renminbi since last June, when it traded around 6.827.
The rise in the Chinese currency engineered by Beijing has gone in fits and starts. In 2005, the authorities allowed the renminbi to strengthen modestly after longstanding accusations by governments around the world that China was keeping its currency artificially weak to increase its exports. But in 2008, Beijing took a long pause, once again holding the renminbi steady to steer its giant economy through the global financial crisis. In June, the rise resumed.
The gains since then are small compared with the sharp upward moves staged by the currencies of many other emerging economies. Economic growth and interest rates well above those seen in developed economies have prompted large flows of cash into many emerging nations, pushing currencies like the Malaysian ringgit, the Mexican peso, the Brazilian real and the South African rand sharply higher since last year.
The renminbi's strength comes amid a backdrop of a generally weak dollar against a large number of currencies, as investors worry about the strength of the U.S. economic recovery.
The relatively small rise in the renminbi has not been enough to end occasionally vocal criticism by some U.S. policy makers and business executives, who continue to argue that the renminbi's valuation gives Chinese exporters an unfair advantage over their U.S. counterparts by making Chinese goods inexpensive overseas.
The move Friday past the eye-catching level of 6.50, and a climb of 0.9 percent during April, highlighted that the authorities in Beijing are serious about allowing the renminbi to strengthen -- albeit at a pace that is slow enough in their eyes not to damage the Chinese export sector.
At the same time, by making it cheaper for China to import oil, iron ore and other goods, a rise in the renminbi is one way of combating inflation, which has become an increasingly worrisome and politically sensitive problem in China.
"Clearly, policy makers are increasingly using currency appreciation to combat imported inflation," commented Dariusz Kowalczyk, an economist at Credit Agricole in Hong Kong, wrote in a research note.
Most observers believe China will continue with a gradual appreciation rather than an all-out revaluation.
A revaluation would have meaningful disinflationary effect only if it were large enough to outweigh the sharp rises that global commodity prices have staged this year, Mr. Kowalczyk wrote. However, a gain of such magnitude "would have a devastating impact on Chinese exports and employment, a side effect too negative to be acceptable for policy makers," he said.

Full text: SHANGHAI
Here's a fact about China that you may not know: people in Shanghai today have a longer life expectancy than Americans.
A child in Shanghai is expected to live 82 years. In the United States, the figure is not quite 79 years. (For all of China, including rural areas, life expectancy is lower, 73 years -- but rising steadily.)
The harsh repression in China these days rightly garners headlines, but health data reflect another side of a nation that could scarcely be more complex and contradictory.
For those who remember Shanghai a quarter-century ago as a dilapidated city where farmers would collect night soil from families without sanitation, it's extraordinary that among permanent residents of Shanghai, infant mortality is 2.9 deaths per 1,000 births. That is well below the rate of 5.3 in New York City. (Include migrant laborers living in Shanghai, perhaps a fairer comparison, and the rate climbs to a bit higher than in New York.)
That Shanghai child enjoys a world-class education in a public school -- the best school system of any in a recent 65-nation survey, although it's also true that Chinese schools have their own problems such as widespread cheating and stifling of creativity.
Since 1990, the country has reduced infant mortality rates by 54 percent, according to Unicef statistics. On a Chinese scale, that represents more than 360,000 children's lives saved each year.
That's what makes China such a fascinating and contradictory place. Other countries, from Egypt to North Korea, oppress and impoverish their people. But the Chinese Communist Party in the reform era has been oppressive politically -- even worse lately, with the harshest clampdown in two decades -- while hugely enriching its people.
President Hu Jintao and other top Communist Party officials are autocrats, yes, but unusually competent autocrats. Polls show Chinese citizens pretty happy with their lot by international standards, although there's some doubt about how meaningful these polls are. My hunch is that if the Communist Party did hold free elections, it would win by a landslide -- especially in rural areas.
A Harvard scholar once told me that today's China is best approached with ambivalence, and that seems about right to me. The crackdown that I deplored in my last column is real, and so is the stunning level of official corruption. But the same government that throws small numbers of dissidents in prison also provides new opportunities to hundreds of millions.
What's the trade-off between imprisoning a brilliant Nobel Peace Prize-winning dissident like Liu Xiaobo and saving hundreds of thousands of babies' lives each year through improved health care? There isn't one. The two sides of China are incommensurate. They are the yin and yang of 21st-century China.
The United States tends to perceive China through a Manichaean lens -- either the economic juggernaut overcoming poverty and investing brilliantly in alternative energy, or the Darth Vader that tortures dissidents. In fact, both are equally real. Likewise, China abuses trade pacts, but it has also been appreciating its currency (mostly through inflation) much more than Americans give it credit for.
We face a period in which Chinese-American tensions are likely to rise, aggravated by the American presidential election and the Chinese leadership transition in 2012, as well as by the crackdown that was the topic of my last column.
When I lived in China in the 1980s and '90s, there was always an awkward economic imbalance between me and my Chinese friends. I had a car, and they had bicycles. I paid for our meals together because I was so much better off.
Now there's a new imbalance: Some of those same people ride around in chauffeured limousines while I get around in taxis. They take me to fancy restaurants whose prices give me headaches.
One Chinese friend took me to a home with private indoor basketball court and personal movie theater. It was a tribute to the stunning improvement in the country's standard of living. But it also speaks to growing income gaps at a time when, by official figures, 320 million rural Chinese do not even have access to safe water.
Moreover, some of the economic boom appears attributable to a bubble, particularly in real estate. And some of the grand fortunes are linked to corruption by government officials. One friend, the son of a Politburo member, once told me that he was being paid hundreds of thousands of dollars a year by a Chinese company just to be on its board. That way, the company could persuade local governments to give it land at reduced prices.
What are we to make of such a country?
That it contains multitudes. And that at this time of rising China-United States tensions, any simplistic black or white view of it may well be right -- but also incomplete and misleading.

Full text: With Washington looking for ways to rein in costly entitlement programs and state governments struggling to balance budgets, conservatives have revived an old nostrum: turning Medicaid into a block grant program.
The desire for fiscal relief is understandable. Medicaid insures low-income people and in these tough economic times, enrollment and costs -- for the federal government and state governments -- have swelled.
Representative Paul Ryan, and the House Republicans, are now proposing to ease Washington's strain by capping federal contributions. Like his proposal for Medicare, that would only shift the burden -- this time onto both state governments and beneficiaries.
Still, some governors may be tempted. His plan promises them greater flexibility to manage their programs -- and achieve greater efficiency and save money. That may sound good, but the truth is, no foreseeable efficiencies will compensate for the big loss of federal contribution.
Mr. Ryan also wants to repeal the health care reform law and its requirement that states expand their Medicaid rolls starting in 2014. Once again Washington would pay the vast bulk of the added cost, so states would be turning down a very good deal to save a lesser amount of money.

Here's how Medicaid currently works: Washington sets minimum requirements for who can enroll and what services must be covered, and pays half of the bill in the richest states and three-quarters of the bill in the poorest state. If people are poor enough to qualify and a medical service recommended by their doctors is covered, the state and federal governments will pick up the tab, with minimal co-payments by the beneficiaries. That is a big plus for enrollees' health, and a healthy population is good for everyone. But the costs are undeniably high.
Enter the House Republicans' budget proposal. Instead of a commitment to insure as many people as meet the criteria, it would substitute a set amount per state. Starting in 2013, the grant would probably equal what the state would have received anyway through federal matching funds, although that is not spelled out. After that, the block grant would rise each year only at the national rate of inflation, with adjustments for population growth.
There are several problems with that, starting with that inflation-pegged rate of growth, which could not possibly keep pace with the rising cost of medical care. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that federal payments would be 35 percent lower in 2022 than currently projected and 49 percent lower in 2030.
To make up the difference, states would probably have to cut payments to doctors, hospitals or nursing homes; curtail eligibility; reduce benefits; or increase their own payments for Medicaid. The problems do not end there. If a bad economy led to a sharp jump in unemployment, a state's grant would remain the same. Nor would the block grant grow fast enough to accommodate expensive advances in medicine, rising demand for long-term care, or unexpected health care needs in the wake of epidemics or natural disasters. This would put an ever-tightening squeeze on states, forcing them to drop enrollees, cut services or pump up their own contributions.
This is not the way to go. The real problem is not Medicaid. Contrary to most perceptions, it is a relatively efficient program -- with low administrative costs, a high reliance on managed care and much lower payments to providers than other public and private insurance.
The real problem is soaring medical costs. The Ryan plan does little to address that. The health care law, which Republicans have vowed to repeal, seeks to reform the entire system to deliver quality care at lower cost.
To encourage that process, President Obama recently proposed a simplified matching rate for Medicaid, which would reward states for efficiencies and automatically increase federal payments if a recession drives up enrollments and state costs. The president's approach is better for low-income Americans and for state budgets as well.

Full text: Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, faces a crisis of confidence. He is excoriated on the right for debasing the currency, and blasted on the left for failing to stimulate more than he has. It has gotten so bad that last week Mr. Bernanke, who prefers to discuss monetary policy with erudite professors like himself, submitted to the indignity of a news conference. Among the uninvited was Representative Ron Paul, who is flirting with a presidential run, and who, if he took office in 2013, would like nothing more than to celebrate the Fed's centennial by ... abolishing it.
And that got me to thinking: What if there were no Fed? Don't laugh; it has happened before. The United States had a primitive central bank, conceived by Alexander Hamilton, but President James Madison let its charter lapse in 1811. A second such bank became the target of President Andrew Jackson, who viewed it as a "hydra" and a "curse" upon the nation. Jackson sought to decertify the bank and, in 1836, succeeded. Never mind that the following year, the United States was plunged into a serious financial panic. The curse had been lifted, not to reappear for nearly a century.
Established in 1913, the Fed was to be a banker to the nation's banks, controlling the money supply and, thus, the value of the currency. Without a Fed, someone else would have to handle these (and other) tasks of central banking.
"Money," observes the Fed historian Allan H. Meltzer, "does not take care of itself." But who else could regulate the value of money? And regulate its value in relation to what?
In its founding days, the United States defined the dollar by an explicit weight of gold or silver. During the first half of the 19th century, state-chartered banks issued notes, preferably backed by metal, that circulated much as dollar bills do today. But since these banks were private, and differed widely in their standards, their notes were accorded different values. In effect, the country had lots of "monies."
The United States moved to normalize the situation during the Civil War. It restricted the issuance of notes to more uniform, federally chartered banks, which were required to hold Treasury bonds (as well as gold) in reserve.
Should the Fed be interred, this abbreviated history provides some clues about alternatives. One solution would be for private banks to issue money -- perhaps bearing the likeness of Jamie Dimon and the seal of his bank, JPMorgan Chase. Alternatively, the Treasury could do it.
But what will the money represent? Gold is the first obvious answer. James Grant, the newsletter writer, author and gold bug par excellence, asserts that gold money is superior to the "fiat" money of the Fed. By fiat, he means that it has value only because the Fed says it does. (Representative Paul, less diplomatically, refers to Federal Reserve notes as "counterfeits" and to the Fed as a price fixer.)
Let us interject that in any monetary system, some authority must fix either the price of money or the supply. McDonald's can either set the price of a hamburger and let the market consume the quantity it will -- or, it can insist on selling a specified quantity, in which case consumer demand will determine the price.
The Fed has a similar choice with money. The Bernanke Fed, which is trying to stimulate the economy, regulates the price of money -- the interest rate -- presently 0.0 percent. Paul Volcker, who assumed command of the Fed in 1979, when inflation was rampant, chose the opposite tactic. Mr. Volcker provided a specific (and, dare I say, miserly) quantity of liquidity, letting interest rates go where the market directed -- ultimately 20 percent. There is an element of arbitrary choice either way.
The gold standard, in effect, replaces the Fed chief with the collective wisdom (or luck) of the mining industry. Rather than entrust the money supply to a guru or a professor, money is limited by the quantity of bullion. The law in the early 20th century stipulated that dollars be backed 40 percent in gold. This fixed the dollar in relation to metal but not in relation to things, like shoes or yarn, that dollars could buy. This was because the quantity of bullion that banks had in reserve, relative to the size of the economy, fluctuated. As a historian noted, it was as if "the yardstick of value was 36 inches long in 1879 ... 46 inches in 1896, 13 and a half inches in 1920."
The gold standard -- which John Maynard Keynes termed a "barbarous relic" -- led to ruinous deflations. When gold reserves contracted, so did the money supply. David Moss, a Harvard Business School professor, asserts that the United States experienced more banking panics in the years without a central bank than any other industrial nation, often when people feared for the quality of paper; specifically, it experienced them in 1837, 1839, 1857, 1873 and 1907.
The Fed was conceived to alleviate such crises; that is, to be "the lender of last resort." This function was fulfilled, ad hoc, by the financier J. P. Morgan in the panic of 1907. But Morgan was old, destined to die the year the Fed was created; some institution was needed. Hostility toward central banks, an American tradition, was such that in 1910, lawmakers and bankers convened at Jekyll Island, Ga. -- under the ruse of going duck hunting -- to sketch a blueprint.
Part of the aim of the new central bank was a more flexible money supply -- for instance, to lend to farmers in the winter. Another was to lend into the teeth of a panic -- though only to solvent institutions and on sound collateral. The insurance giant American International Group -- a controversial bailout recipient in 2008 -- would not have qualified.
In its early days, the Fed maintained the gold standard -- forcing it to maintain tight money even in 1931, in the midst of the Great Depression. Economists today regard this as a mistake.
The circumstances are relevant to those who envision a Fed-less future. England had departed from the gold standard; worried that the United States would follow suit, people demanded to trade dollars for gold. Professor Meltzer deduces that the gold standard doesn't work for one country alone; the bad paper money corrupts the good.
An alternative to gold, and to the Fed, was suggested by Mr. Bernanke's hero, Milton Friedman: let a computer govern the money supply. John Taylor, a former Treasury official, has derived a formula, the Taylor Rule, which Fed policy often agrees with. Adopting the formula in a mechanical way would trim the deficit a bit, since the Fed could dismiss every one of its 200 economists. The problem with a formula (also its virtue) is its lack of flexibility. Alan S. Blinder, a former Fed vice chairman, notes that strict adherence to the Taylor Rule during the recent crisis would have mandated an interest rate of negative 5 percent. (That is, the economy was so weak, and people so unwilling to borrow money, the computer would have paid people 5 percent a year to accept it.) This being impractical, Mr. Bernanke was moved to improvise a remedy other than negative rates.
If the computer is out and the Fed shuttered, Professor Meltzer suggests that the dollar be backed by euros, pounds and yen (and, eventually, the renminbi). This new money would require that each of the financial powers commits to a targeted rate of inflation -- say, 2 percent a year. People who didn't trust the dollar to maintain its value could trade them for euros. Now there's an idea that would delight the Tea Party -- American money backed by France.
Actually, this system is not terribly different from today's. We have, indeed, fiat money, convertible into foreign exchange and regulated, not always successfully, with the intent of maintaining (or not too quickly depreciating) the dollar's purchasing power. And if money is a unit of value, it is hard to conceive of a yardstick better than purchasing power.
But the Fed, thanks to an act of Congress in 1978, and perhaps to America's suspicious anti-central banking culture, has a dual mission -- protecting the value of the dollar and promoting long-term growth and employment. In this, it differs (at least in degree) from Europe's and other central banks. In many ways, this mission creep -- the Fed's expanded power and role in the economy -- lies at the root of the animus that Americans feel for it.
Banking purists would like, if not to abolish the institution, to return it to the job envisaged on Jekyll Island. They are, in a sense, the financial equivalent to strict constitutionalists. Nostalgia has its place, but so does pragmatism. Mr. Bernanke and his colleagues may be flawed, but democracy trusts in the power to elect, appoint and, if need be, remove. It is fine to lament their alleged excesses -- for instance, the Fed's swollen balance sheet in the name of stimulation, or "quantitative easing." It is another to imagine that regulating the money could be as simple as it was in 1913, or that a formula, or a barbarous relic, could do the job.

Full text: Finally, that great-aunt's tarnished tea service can be put to use -- no polishing needed.
As investors send prices soaring for not only gold, but now also silver, consumers have been unearthing ancient stashes of silverware, teapots and jewelry from long-discarded beaus, and trading them in at pawn shops or selling them on eBay for cash. More and more cash, in fact, as weeks go by.
"We're seeing an increase of people coming in from all walks of life because they hear the news -- gold prices are at record highs, silver prices are at record highs, so they're basically grabbing what they have in their home and coming in to pawn, or sell, the items," said Yigal Adato, an owner of CashCo Pawn in San Diego.
The sharp increase in prices -- on Friday, gold hit a new high, not adjusted for inflation, while silver in April had the largest monthly jump in 28 years -- has had an effect across the spectrum of retailers dealing with precious metals. Plain old silver enjoys new cachet among jewelers moving away from gold. And jewelry designers are opting for cheaper alternatives than metals -- like emeralds, in one case.
Even the business of marriage enters in. Bands of gold are getting closer in price to the diamonds that sit on them. And Indian weddings, with traditional displays of celebratory gold, may be less gilded this summer.
Gold has been surging for years, and on Friday, it almost hit $1,570 for a troy ounce (a nominal high, not adjusted for inflation). Silver, measured by futures for July delivery, is almost as high as it has been since 1980, at more than $48 an ounce, though that comparison, too, is not adjusted for inflation. So far this year, the price of silver has risen more than 50 percent.
Gold has been slower to increase, with contracts for future delivery rising about 9 percent this year. When gold started its most recent run after the banking crisis in fall 2008, it posted a 25 percent gain for all of 2009.
Pawn shops are benefiting. Three publicly traded pawn shop companies, Cash America, EZCorp and FirstCash Financial, recently reported sharp increases in net income compared with a year earlier. For Cash America, the rise was 14 percent; with 34 percent for EZCorp; and 87 percent for FirstCash. Armloads of metal merchandise brought in by customers helped to drive those results: at FirstCash, domestic revenue from wholesale scrap jewelry rose 45 percent.
Worried about inflation, and wanting the stability of precious metals, investors are buying them in coins, and via vehicles like the iShares Silver Trust, an exchange-traded fund backed by silver.
"Investors who feel they may have missed the boat with gold have jumped into silver because it has a better price point," said Suki Cooper, a precious-metals analyst for Barclays Capital.
Yet even if investors think $48 an ounce is reasonable, jewelers say the price has turned once-plebian silver into something extravagant.
"I felt you'd never see the day when silver would start to jack up like this," said Alexis Bittar, who designs jewelry sold at stores like Saks Fifth Avenue and Nordstrom. "It's always been considered not like a base metal, but fairly close to it."
He added, "But next to gold, it's the next precious metal in line, and it makes sterling seem more luxurious."
Mr. Bittar, whose jewelry typically sells for a few hundred dollars, said he was making shifts to keep prices flat. Brass, for instance, substitutes as a base for silver on items that will be coated with gold, and he is reducing the amount of metal used in some designs.
J. C. Penney, which is also trying to keep prices flat on most items, began using alternative metals when gold prices started rising, and now sells items made with sterling silver, cobalt and Platinaire, a mix of silver and platinum, said Rebecca Winter, a Penney spokeswoman.
Also, she said, the retailer realized that customers did not mind paying higher prices for trendy pieces. In February, Penney introduced Alexandra Gemstones, a line meant to capitalize on the popularity of colorful accessories while avoiding silver and gold.
Michael Bisceglia, the president of the jewelry company Stauer, is also emphasizing gemstones -- even rubies, he said, can be had at low prices.
"Emeralds, rubies, sapphires, tanzanite, pearls -- those prices haven't gone up that much, so I'm adding more gemstones to jewelry now, and less silver," he said.
As for the Indian weddings, some changes are under consideration. Indian weddings typically involve a lot of gold jewelry, said Anu Duggal, a founder and the executive vice president for new business development for Exclusively.In, a site that sells Indian fashion and jewelry and just introduced a weddings section.
"It is very common for not only the bride and groom, but also the family members to purchase new outfits and jewelry for these events," Ms. Duggal said in an e-mail. She added, "Gold itself is the most common gift given during weddings, and it is customary for the bride to wear pure gold as part of the formal wedding ceremony."
But as the cost of gold has shot up, brides are altering the tradition, shifting to semi-precious and gold-plated jewelry, Ms. Duggal said. "This is becoming more and more acceptable," she said.
At CashCo Pawn, the metals rush has brought in lots of silver inventory, like coins, teapots and flatware. "People receive Tiffany silver items," Mr. Adato said, "and the girlfriend brings it in to sell -- they say: 'You know what? I broke up with this guy. I don't want to see this anymore.' "
In addition, people are still bringing in scrap gold, he added: "gold teeth, a lot of dental work. We get grills once in a while, gold grills."
Joe Ellis, the owner of Cherokee Coins in Alpharetta, Ga., said he had never seen higher demand for gold and silver bars. Customers want coins like the United States silver eagle, generic silver bars, circulated silver dollars, and dimes and quarters from before 1965, when they were made with 90 percent silver.
Cherokee accepts pawned items, but, Mr. Ellis said, that business had slowed. During the recession, he accepted a steady stream of items like broken bracelet chains and silverware, but now, he said, his customers seemed to have little left in their attics and basements.
"Quite frankly, I think people just have so much they can sell," he said.

Abstract: When lauding the economy, Mr. Bernanke and many other economists and politicians point out, correctly, that the unemployment rate has declined from a recession high of 10.1 percent in late 2009 to 8.8 percent now.

Full text: It has long been clear that economists do not see the world the way people experience it. That disconnect is especially pronounced now.
The economy lost steam in the first quarter. Growth in personal consumption -- the single largest component of the economy -- slowed markedly. Business-related construction cratered and residential construction fell. Exports stumbled. The only unambiguous plus was continued business investment in equipment and software, which is necessary but not sufficient for overall growth.
In all, economic growth slowed from an annual rate of 3.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2010 to 1.8 percent in the first quarter of 2011.
Not to worry. Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, called the slowdown "transitory," a judgment echoed by many economists who believe that the poor performance can be chalked up to bad weather, political unrest and other presumably temporary setbacks.
If only. Take jobs: When lauding the economy, Mr. Bernanke and many other economists and politicians point out, correctly, that the unemployment rate has declined from a recession high of 10.1 percent in late 2009 to 8.8 percent now. That would be encouraging news if it indicated robust hiring for good jobs. It does not.
Over the last year, the number of new hires has been outstripped by the masses who have either given up looking for work or who have not undertaken a consistent job search, say, after graduating from high school or college. Those missing millions are not counted in the official jobless rate; if they were, unemployment today would be 9.8 percent. The rate would be 15.7 percent if it included those who took part-time jobs in lieu of full-time ones.
Another purported bright spot in the unemployment data -- the relatively low jobless rate for college-educated workers -- does not stand up to scrutiny. For college educated workers over age 25, unemployment is indeed lower than for other groups. But for college graduates under age 25, unemployment over the last year has averaged 9.7 percent, and shows no sign of improvement.
Inflation is another example. Mr. Bernanke and others say that today's inflation will likely be temporary, and they are probably right. But one of the reasons for believing higher prices won't endure is that, in general, for inflation to take off, wages must also rise. There's no sign of that. Stagnant wages mean Americans will have to cut consumption in the face of higher prices, and as demand drops, prices are subdued -- hardly reason to cheer.
The economy still needs help and, specifically, a sustained focus on jobs and income. Instead, policy makers are gearing up for deep spending cuts, ignoring the damage they are likely to cause. Last quarter, cutbacks by governments at all levels took a chunk out of overall growth. If cuts of similar or greater magnitude become the norm, the slow economic pace of the first quarter also could very well become the norm. It's nice to believe slowing growth is transitory. But as long as spending, jobs and incomes are at risk and policy priorities are skewed, it's hard to believe in a turnaround.

Full text: HONG KONG -- Rare earth prices are reaching rarefied heights.
World prices have doubled in the last four months for rare earths -- metallic elements needed for many of the most sophisticated civilian and military technologies, whether smartphones or smart bombs.
And this year's increases come atop price gains of as much as fourfold during 2010.
The reason is basic economics: demand continues to outstrip efforts to expand supplies and break China's chokehold on the market.
Neodymium, a rare earth necessary for a range of products including headphones and hybrid electric cars, now fetches more than $283 a kilogram ($129 a pound) on the spot market. A year ago it sold for about $42 a kilogram ($19 a pound).
Samarium, crucial to the manufacture of missiles, has climbed to more than $146 a kilogram, up from $18.50 a year earlier.
While the price inflation is a concern to manufacturers, consumers in many cases will barely notice the soaring cost of rare earths. Even though the materials are crucial to the performance of everyday equipment like automotive catalytic converters and laptop computer display screens, rare earths are typically are used only in trace quantities.
One exception is the Toyota Prius hybrid car, whose manufacture uses a kilogram of neodymium.
Toyota has been raising prices for the Prius, but has cited demand for the car and economic conditions. While acknowledging that rising prices for raw materials in general have affected the company's overall financial results, Toyota has declined to provide a breakdown of the role of rare earths. (Production problems stemming from the Japanese earthquake and tsunami have also crimped supplies of Prius cars, which are made only in Japan.)
The high prices for rare earths reflect turmoil in the global industry that mines and refines them. China, which controls more than 95 percent of the market, has further restricted exports so as to conserve supplies for its own high-tech and green energy industries. That is despite the World Trade Organization's ban on most export restrictions.
Meanwhile, an ambitious effort to open the world's largest rare earth refinery in Malaysia, which had seemed certain to begin operating by this autumn, is tied up over regulatory reviews of the disposal plans for thousands of tons of low-level radioactive waste the plant would produce annually. Public opposition to the refinery is evident in the weekly protest demonstrations now being held.
At the same time, Japanese companies are finding it harder than originally hoped to recycle rare earths from electronics and to begin rare earth mining and refining in Vietnam.
Although rare earths are crucial to the supply chains of some of the world's biggest manufacturers, the industry that mines and refines them has long been characterized by small, entrepreneurial companies. Lately, though, soaring prices have contributed to industry consolidation.
Last month, for example, Solvay, a big Belgian chemical-industrial corporation announced that it would pay $4.8 billion to acquire Rhodia of France, a technological leader in making complex chemicals based on rare earths.
That same day, April 4, Molycorp, the only American company currently producing rare earths, said it had paid $89 million for a more than 90 percent stake in Silmet of Estonia, a much smaller company that is Rhodia's only European rival in rare earth processing.
In Malaysia, where the giant rare earth refinery is under construction near the eastern port of Kuantan, regulators are delaying approval for an operating permit amid public concern about naturally occurring low-level radioactive contamination of the rare earth ore, which will be mined in Australia.
Raja Dato Abdul Aziz bin Raja Adnan, the director general of the Malaysian Atomic Energy Licensing Board, said the board had asked the Lynas Corporation of Australia, which is building the refinery, to provide additional documentation before accepting its application for an initial operating permit. It will take up to six months to review the application, Raja Adnan said, and Lynas will not be allowed to bring any raw material to the plant until a permit is issued.
But Nicholas Curtis, Lynas's executive chairman, said that he believed the company could obtain the necessary approvals before September and that his company was sticking to its plan to begin feeding Australian ore into the Malaysian refinery's kilns by the end of that month.
The Malaysian government also announced last week that it would appoint a panel of international experts to review the safety of Lynas's plans. The company said it welcomed the move.
But Fuziah Salleh, an opposition legislator who represents downtown Kuantan and has been leading weekly protests, is mistrustful.
"The people's concerns are that the independent panel will be formed by the government to prove that they are right," she wrote in an e-mail message.
Toyota Tsusho, a materials purchasing unit of the Toyota Group, has separately encountered complex local regulations as it seeks to open rare earth mining and processing operations in Vietnam. The project was announced last October during a Chinese embargo on rare earth shipments to Japan. Takeshi Mutsuura, a spokesman, said that Toyota Tsusho now hoped to reach a contract in Vietnam this summer and start production in early 2013.
As recently as last autumn, there were also ambitious hopes in Japan to recycle rare earths from electronics waste. Dowa Holdings tried then to come up with ways to separate rare earths at a recycling factory in northwest Japan but found the task significantly more difficult than recycling other, more widely available precious metals. The recycling factory is now recovering 19 other metals instead, including cobalt and lithium.
All of this has left the world even more dependent on China. The Chinese government last autumn showed a willingness to use that near monopoly as a trade weapon, halting shipments to Japan from late September to mid-November, during a territorial dispute over islands in the East China Sea.
Although Beijing has officially denied that it imposed a Japanese embargo last fall, China's own trade data released since then show that its shipments to Japan suddenly fell to zero in October for rare earth metals, and to nearly zero for rare earth oxides -- which are more processed chemical compounds. At the beginning of this year China reduced its rare earth export quotas to all countries, while raising export taxes on some rare earths to 25 percent, from 15 percent previously.
Since April 1, China has also raised taxes on rare earth mining companies to the equivalent of $8 for each kilogram of refined product; rare earths were previously taxed like many other nonferrous minerals in China, at less than 50 cents a kilogram.
One of the biggest questions hanging over the rare earths industry is whether the United States, the European Union and Japan will file a World Trade Organization case against China, challenging its export quotas and duties. James Bacchus, a former chairman of the W.T.O. appeals tribunal in Geneva, said that Chinese trade data shows a virtually complete halt in shipments to Japan last autumn could be cited to buttress any W.T.O. filing by rare earth-importing countries.
China denies violating the W.T.O. ban on export restrictions, saying that it qualified for an exception to the ban for environmental protection and conservation of natural resources. But China has done little to restrict its own industries' consumption of rare earths, usually a prerequisite for invoking an environmental defense.

Abstract: White House advisers and Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, argue that the bad news is a merely a blip caused by bad weather, a temporary cut in military purchases and other one-time factors. Congress and the administration have until August to increase the federal government's authority to borrow money, and Republican leaders say they will insist on spending cuts as part of any agreement.

Full text: It's obviously been a good week for the Obama administration. But it comes at a dangerous time, for both the administration and the economy. The excitement over tracking down Osama bin Laden could end up making the president and his advisers less panicked over the state of the economy. And they should be a little panicked.
For the second straight year, the recovery seems to be at risk of stalling. The economy grew at an annual rate of only 1.8 percent last quarter -- eerily similar to the 1.7 percent growth last spring, just when job growth started slowing down. Fully 80 percent of people say the economy is in fairly bad or very bad shape, according to a New York Times/CBS Poll last month. More people say it's getting worse than getting better, the opposite of a few months ago.
White House advisers and Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, argue that the bad news is a merely a blip caused by bad weather, a temporary cut in military purchases and other one-time factors. They may be right, too. Stock market investors certainly share their optimism: the Standard & Poor's 500 index is near a postrecession high.
But both Wall Street and Washington were also optimistic around this time last year -- too optimistic. The unfortunate truth is that the recoveries from financial crises have a habit of disappointing.
Crises do so much damage that they leave businesses and households predisposed to believe the worst and to pull back at the first hint of economic weakness. Households are slow to resume spending. Banks are slow to lend, especially to small businesses. Companies are slow to hire.
All this is why the typical financial crisis has caused unemployment to rise for almost five years, according to historical work by the economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff. We are well ahead of that timetable, thanks to aggressive action by the Fed, the Obama administration and, in its final months, the Bush administration. But our working assumption should be that this recovery will remain at risk for a long time.
If it stalls out for a second year in a row, the consequences could be particularly bad. The specter of a "lost decade," like Japan's, would become commonplace. Pessimism would feed yet more hesitation from businesses and households. For Mr. Obama himself, of course, the raid in Abbottabad could become a version of President George H. W. Bush's Gulf War: the foreign policy triumph that turned into an electoral footnote.
I suspect that Mr. Obama's advisers have remained publicly optimistic over the last few months because they consider optimism to be one of the few economic tools they have left. The sensible step for Congress would be to pair long-term deficit reduction with a mix of short-term tax cuts and aid to states, whose budget cuts are leading to layoffs. But Congress hasn't shown itself capable of separating the short term and long term. So the odds of new legislation to help the economy anytime soon are roughly nil.
Even so, there are still two steps the White House can take, and now is the time to start planning them. If policy makers wait to take action until the recovery has undeniably stalled -- as they did last year -- they will have waited too long.
The first step is to remember the economy's vulnerability when negotiating a deal over the debt ceiling. Congress and the administration have until August to increase the federal government's authority to borrow money, and Republican leaders say they will insist on spending cuts as part of any agreement.
There are still plenty of sensible cuts for the two parties to make. Tax breaks (which many economists consider a form of spending) for both businesses and individuals can be reduced. Military spending, which has risen more than 70 percent in inflation-adjusted terms over the past decade, can be cut, too. Many social programs, meanwhile, don't focus enough on outcomes and waste money in the process.
But it would be folly to start making these cuts immediately and potentially put people out of work. Last month's deal to avert a government shutdown did a good job of minimizing the number of cuts that would affect the economy this year. Policy makers would be wise to repeat the pattern in the debt ceiling talks, making more future cuts and fewer immediate ones.
The second step involves the only way in which I can imagine Congress taking action to help the economy.
At the end of this year, about $225 billion of temporary tax cuts and emergency jobless benefits are scheduled to expire. These provisions were part of the compromise bill in last year's lame-duck Congressional session that also extended the Bush tax cuts. The Bush tax cuts were extended through 2012, however, while the other provisions -- including a payroll tax cut for households and a tax cut for expanding businesses -- expire at the end of 2011.
Given the legitimate concern about the deficit, many members of Congress will want to let these temporary tax cuts lapse. But if the economy remains weak, continuing them for one more year will make sense.
Their economic impact is not small. Moody's Analytics estimated that the economy would have 1.1 million more jobs at the end of 2012 if the tax cuts and jobless benefits were extended. Yet their impact on the long-term debt is minimal. Tiny changes in Medicare could more than pay a one-time, $225 billion bill.
Somewhere -- in the White House or in the halls of Congress -- somebody should be coming up with a plan to sell an extension of these measures. Persuading a financially battered public that it deserves another short-term tax cut isn't likely to be too difficult.
Above all, Washington should avoid the temptation to get giddy about any one piece of economic good news. Those bits of encouraging news will happen. We may even get one on Friday, when the Labor Department reports on job growth in April.
The big lesson of financial crises is that too much optimism exacts a steep cost. You can make a case that the long hunt for Osama bin Laden offers the same lesson. A tough job is not done until it is undeniably done.

Full text: Not every fiscal quarter can have an "Avatar."
That seemed to be Rupert Murdoch's message on Wednesday as his sprawling media company, the News Corporation, reported earnings that largely fell short of most analysts' expectations. The company's total revenue for the quarter that ended in March, $8.26 billion, was down 6 percent from the same quarter last year, when ticket sales for the blockbuster film "Avatar" greatly increased revenue.
"Avatar" became the highest-grossing film in history (not adjusted for inflation), but with that title came one downside for the News Corporation: "challenging comparisons," as Mr. Murdoch put it in a statement, between this year and last year's earnings. The company's net income for the quarter, $639 million, or 24 cents a share, was down 24 percent from the same quarter last year, when the net income was $839 million, or 32 cents a share.
Ticket sales for "Black Swan," a film released last December that scored a best actress Oscar for Natalie Portman, led the film division's revenue in the most recent quarter. Citing the new animated film "Rio," which was released three weeks ago but has already earned more than "Black Swan," Mr. Murdoch said the "difficult comparisons in this segment over the past nine months are now behind us."
Cable channels like FX and the Fox News Channel remained by far the biggest contributors to the News Corporation's bottom line, accounting for more than 60 percent of profit. Like other major media companies, the News Corporation enjoyed significant gains in cable advertising revenue over the same time last year -- in its case, up 14 percent in the United States and up an average of 18 percent in other countries.
Fox News, which is the most-watched cable news channel in the United States, continues to be a profit center for the company. In the most recent quarter, Fox News recorded its highest-ever operating profit margin, David DeVoe, the company's chief financial officer, said in a conference call with analysts Wednesday.
The company's local and national broadcast television division also showed strong results, having mounted a recovery from the recession. It helped that Fox had the rights to the Super Bowl this year and that the eight-year-old "American Idol" franchise has, as Mr. DeVoe asserted, found a "second life" with new, nicer judges.
But attention lately has been focused not on the News Corporation's television assets, but on underperforming digital pieces of the company. Since last year, it has been attempting to sell Myspace, the ghost of a social network that suffered increased losses in the most recent quarter. Chase Carey, the News Corporation chief operating officer, said Wednesday that an unspecified Myspace transaction is "on course."
The company is also trying to spin off IGN.com, a portfolio of video game news Web sites, according to AllThingsD, which reported the plan earlier this week.
In its publishing division, the News Corporation is trying to market the tablet newspaper, The Daily, that it introduced on the iPad in February. Mr. Carey said that the company lost about $10 million on The Daily in the quarter and emphasized that "it's very early days." He did not share any data about the number of subscribers to the newspaper, but a News Corporation employee was overheard on the conference call saying that the app that delivers the newspaper has been downloaded 800,000 times.
The publishing division posted a steep decline in net income in the quarter because of a $125 million charge related to a legal settlement at News America Marketing, its coupons and consumer marketing outfit. Excluding that charge, the company over all posted earnings of 26 cents a share.
Analysts pressed News Corporation executives on Wednesday on the status of its attempted acquisition of the 61 percent of British Sky Broadcasting, or BSkyB, that it does not yet own. The company is awaiting final approval of the deal by the British government.
If the approval comes -- and by most accounts it will come soon -- the News Corporation may have to pay more than the $12.4 billion it has already committed. Mr. Carey had little new to say about it, but he reiterated his hope for a "reasonable deal."

Full text: CORRECTION APPENDED
6:58 p.m. Updated
The most notable thing about the first news press conference ever of the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, last week was what wasn't discussed: banking regulation.
We hardly need more evidence that the most powerful banking regulator in the world, one that became even more powerful after financial reform was passed, is also the least examined. Mr. Bernanke's opening remarks were about monetary policy and the economy. When he answered questions, he repeatedly referred to the Fed's "dual mandate" - to keep inflation low and stable and to maintain full employment for the economy.
But that's not the Federal Reserve's true dual mandate. The Fed is indeed the steward of the economy, but it also has to regulate the financial system, making sure banks are safe and sound.
In the years before the financial crisis, the Fed was a miserable failure in that role, a creature of the banks, not a watchdog. The news conference was an opportunity for Mr. Bernanke to demonstrate what the Fed had learned from the crisis about banking oversight. After all, a collapsed financial system does spectacular damage to an economy.
There's more to discuss about this now than ever. Under the giant Dodd-Frank package, the Fed was given an expanded regulatory role. The new consumer financial products regulator is housed within the central bank. The Fed also now officially oversees investment banks, which it had to rescue during the crisis. Congress broadened the Fed's remit to cover nonfinancial institutions deemed "systemically important." Congress created a new role, the "vice chairman of supervision," to raise the prominence and importance of its responsibility. (It remains unfilled.) Perhaps most important, the Federal Reserve is supposed to play a major role in taking over big banks that fail.
Banking supervision has always been something of a backwater at the Fed. Within the institution, the sexy stuff is monetary policy. That's where most of the resources and attention goes. The chairman and the board spend a disproportionate amount of their time on it, and monetary policy expertise largely dictates the selection of board members. Many question that mind-set.
"Either expressly or implicitly, the Fed permeates every part of the Dodd-Frank reform," says Dennis Kelleher, the chairman of Better Markets, a new Washington advocacy group that aims to be a Wall Street watchdog. "Yet there is no indication that the leadership of Fed understands or is undertaking its new role as systemic risk regulator. It's not on the mind of the Fed chairman."
Without much public comment, the Fed is making critical decisions about the banks today. It just ran a round of stress tests for the banking system in which most banks came up smelling like roses. Most big banks were allowed to pay dividends and pay back the government's Troubled Asset Relief Program money. Yet the economy is weaker than the Fed expected, and the real estate market, which makes up the bulk of banks' exposure, is having a second downturn. What gives the Fed so much confidence that the banks are properly valuing their assets and are adequately capitalized?
For a brief moment back in 2009, it was actually considered bizarre to give the Fed more power. Christopher J. Dodd, then the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, proposed creating a new financial regulatory infrastructure, stripping the Fed of its mandate.
Sadly, the bill was so dead on arrival it wasn't clear if even Mr. Dodd supported the Dodd bill. Nonetheless, removing banking regulation from the Fed's umbrella would have some clear advantages. Monetary policy is a pretty hard job. It might make some sense to split off regulation just to ease the burden.
And monetary policy can be in conflict with banking regulation. A central bank might prefer to shore up investor confidence and move on from a financial crisis without taking punitive action against wrongdoers, thinking that aggressive action might undermine faith in the system. Sound familiar to anyone?
Mr. Bernanke's news conference was also supposed to be a step toward realizing the Fed's new commitment to "transparency."
That's certainly welcome, but it has only gone so far. Congress repeatedly asked for more information on extraordinary actions taken by the Fed during the financial crisis, but was met initially with stonewalling. The central bank fought a lawsuit initiated by Bloomberg News to release data on what kinds of securities it bought during the financial crisis and from whom. When it lost and was finally forced to release the information, it did so in a fashion that it made assimilating the information difficult.
Earlier this year, when the Fed conducted its second round of bank stress tests, it made less information public than it had in the first round in 2009.
"Regulation needs accountability and transparency, and the Fed is just not set up to be accountable or transparent," says Mike Konczal, a fellow at the Roosevelt Institute, a liberal think tank focused on financial matters.
The sight of a Fed chairman answering reporters' questions in declarative English certainly was a departure from tradition. On Thursday, Bernanke is giving a speech on banking regulation. Let's hope that brings a comparable approach to regulation, which is ultimately far more significant.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.
Online Correction: May 4, 2011, Wednesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this column misspelled the surname of a Roosevelt Institute fellow who was quoted on the Federal Reserve's accountability and transparency. It is Mike Konczal, not Konzcal.

Correction: May 6, 2011, Friday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Because of an editing error, The Trade column on the DealBook page on Thursday, about the Federal Reserve's banking regulatory role, referred incorrectly to Better Markets, whose chairman, Dennis Kelleher, commented on the matter. It is an advocacy group, not a lobbying group.

Full text: Stocks fell Wednesday, with commodity producers driving a third straight loss for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, as lower-than-estimated reports on service industries and job growth damped optimism in the economy.
Caterpillar and General Electric, among companies most tied to the economy, fell at least 1.7 percent to lead declines in the Dow Jones industrial average. Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold and Occidental Petroleum fell more than 2.4 percent as oil and metal prices sank.
The S.& P. 500 lost 9.30 points, or 0.69 percent, to 1,347.32. The index has dropped every day since closing at the highest level since June 2008. The Dow average fell 83.93 points, or 0.66 percent, to 12,723.58 today. The Nasdaq fell 13.39 points, or 0.47 percent, to 2,828.23.
Oil for June delivery declined 1.6 percent to $109.24 a barrel in New York.
"We've seen some tempering of economic statistics," said Michael Mullaney, a money manager at Fiduciary Trust in Boston. "We're going to see some sloppiness in the market until we get a clear indication on whether the sluggishness in economic activity is temporary. Employment growth is critical for the economy becoming self-sustaining."
The S.& P. 500 extended its decline since April 29 to 1.2 percent. Oil, metal and chemical companies have led the market's slump. Silver futures have fallen 19 percent in three days. Oil has slumped 4.1 percent.
Stocks extended losses after a report showed that service industries in the United States expanded in April at the slowest rate in eight months as higher fuel prices prompted companies to cut back.
The Institute for Supply Management's index of nonmanufacturing companies declined to 52.8 last month, from 57.3 in March. Readings greater than 50 signal growth, and the median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News called for a gain to 57.5. A gauge of new orders dropped by the most since record-keeping began in 1997.
An ADP Employer Services report showed that employment at United States companies increased by 179,000 in April. The median estimate in a survey called for a 198,000 increase this month.
Caterpillar, the world's largest maker of construction equipment, dropped 2.2 percent, to $110.77. G.E. retreated 1.8 percent, to $20.27.
United States equities also followed European and Asian shares lower amid concern that central banks will need to lift interest rates to fend off accelerating inflation.
Interest rates were lower on Wednesday. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 9/32, to 103 13/32, and the yield fell to 3.22 percent, from 3.25 percent late Tuesday.
Gauges of raw material and energy producers led the declines in the S.& P. 500 within 10 industries, falling at least 1.5 percent. Gold declined after a report that Soros Fund Management may have cut metal holdings. Crude oil dropped to a two-week low as a United States Energy Department report showed supplies surged.
Freeport-McMoRan, the largest publicly traded copper producer, slumped 3.9 percent, to $51.14.

Abstract: [...] a number of people -- like Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson, the co-chairmen of President Obama's debt commission -- have settled on a specific time frame: terrible things will happen within two years unless we make drastic spending cuts. [...] what we do in the next couple of years hardly matters at all for U.S. solvency, which mainly depends on what we'll do in the long run about Medicare and taxes.

Full text: From G.D.P. to private-sector payrolls, from business surveys to new claims for unemployment insurance, key economic indicators suggest that the recovery may be sputtering.
And it wasn't much of a recovery to start with. Employment has risen from its low point, but it has grown no faster than the adult population. And the plight of the unemployed continues to worsen: more than six million Americans have been out of work for six months or longer, and more than four million have been jobless for more than a year.
It would be nice if someone in Washington actually cared.
It's not as if our political class is feeling complacent. On the contrary, D.C. economic discourse is saturated with fear: fear of a debt crisis, of runaway inflation, of a disastrous plunge in the dollar. Scare stories are very much on politicians' minds.
Yet none of these scare stories reflect anything that is actually happening, or is likely to happen. And while the threats are imaginary, fear of these imaginary threats has real consequences: an absence of any action to deal with the real crisis, the suffering now being experienced by millions of jobless Americans and their families.
What does Washington currently fear? Topping the list is fear that budget deficits will cause a fiscal crisis any day now. In fact, a number of people -- like Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson, the co-chairmen of President Obama's debt commission -- have settled on a specific time frame: terrible things will happen within two years unless we make drastic spending cuts.
I have no idea where that two-year deadline comes from. After all, what we do in the next couple of years hardly matters at all for U.S. solvency, which mainly depends on what we'll do in the long run about Medicare and taxes. And, for what it's worth, actual investors -- people putting real money on the line -- are notably unworried about any near-term fiscal crisis: the Treasury Department continues to have no trouble selling debt and remains able to borrow very cheaply, indicating high confidence on the part of investors that debts will be repaid in full.
Do the scare-mongers even believe their own stories? Maybe not. As Jonathan Chait of The New Republic notes, the politicians most given to apocalyptic rhetoric about the deficit are also utterly opposed to any tax increase; they argue that debt is destroying America, but they'd rather let that happen than accept even a dime of higher taxes. Yet the inconsistency and probable insincerity of their fear-mongering hasn't stopped it from having a huge effect on policy debate.
The deficit isn't the only unfounded fear. I've written before about misguided inflation fear, but, for now, let me focus on a new issue that has suddenly begun to loom large in opinion pieces and remarks on talk shows: fear of a disastrous plunge in the dollar. (Who sends out the memos telling people what to worry about, and why don't I get them?)
What you would never know from all the agitated dollar discussion is that the recent dollar slide is actually tiny compared with big drops in the past, notably under the administration of George W. Bush and during Ronald Reagan's second term. And you'd also never know that those earlier dollar slides, far from hurting the economy, were beneficial, because they helped U.S. manufacturing compete on world markets.
Which brings me back to the destructive effect of focusing on invisible monsters. For the clear and present danger to the American economy isn't what some people imagine might happen one of these days, it's what is actually happening now.
Unemployment isn't just blighting the lives of millions, it's undermining America's future. The longer this goes on, the more workers will find it impossible ever to return to employment, the more young people will find their prospects destroyed because they can't find a decent starting job. It may not create excited chatter on cable TV, but the unemployment crisis is real, and it's eating away at our society.
Yet any action to help the unemployed is vetoed by the fear-mongers. Should we spend modest sums on job creation? No way, say the deficit hawks, who threaten us with the purely hypothetical wrath of financial markets, and, in fact, demand that we slash spending now now now -- which might well send us back into recession. Should the Federal Reserve do more to promote expansion? No, say the inflation and dollar hawks, who have been wrong again and again but insist that this time their dire warnings about runaway prices and a plunging dollar really will be vindicated.
So we're paying a heavy price for Washington's obsession with phantom menaces. By looking for trouble in all the wrong places, our political class is preventing us from dealing with the real crisis: the millions of American men and women who can't find work.

Full text: The extreme volatility of commodities prices and the unpredictability that comes with it is increasing the cost of doing business for everyone.
The price swings have been eye-popping. In March, cocoa futures plummeted 12 percent in less than a minute and then quickly recovered in a "flash crash" that left traders mystified. Cotton futures have fluctuated so wildly that they flipped market circuit-breakers on about two-thirds of the trading days this year. Last November, sugar futures fell more than 20 percent over two days, their biggest two-day sell-off in at least 17 years, and they often swing more in one day than they used to move in a month.
Arcane to the layman, commodities futures are essential to many businesses, like food manufacturers and fuel suppliers, which use them to help set prices and predict costs for items as varied as corn flakes, blue jeans and mocha lattes. Farmers use them to decide which crops to plant. And they keep the wheels of industry turning smoothly by acting like insurance policies to hedge the risks inherent in buying and selling raw ingredients.
But when prices move erratically, it increases the cost of buying the futures and options that protect companies against such changes. Those added costs find their way to the grocery store and the shopping mall.
Consider home heating oil, for example. Sean Cota, a propane gas and heating oil supplier in Bellows Falls, Vt., signs contracts with customers to supply oil to them during the winter heating season.
Since Mr. Cota typically buys oil only as he needs to supply it, he uses heating oil futures and options as a form of insurance to protect himself against unexpected jumps in prices. Seven or eight years ago, he said, such protection added 2 to 6 cents to each gallon of heating oil he bought. These days, volatile oil prices mean it costs him 37 cents a gallon for such hedging -- an extra cost that he expects to add to customers' heating oil bills, which are already higher because the price of oil has risen sharply in the last year.
"It is affecting my company drastically," said Mr. Cota, who has been lobbying in Washington for restrictions on financial flows into the commodities markets. "I pass the extra cost on to customers, but sometimes I just have to swallow it."
Volatility can drive prices down as quickly as it pushes them up. On Thursday, prices for a wide range of commodities plunged, with the broad CRB commodities index closing down 4.9 percent.
Making the situation more confounding for businesses is that commodities have become more volatile for reasons that no one fully understands.
Much of the fluctuation is caused by economic supply and demand. Stockpiles of goods like cotton, corn and coffee are at historically low levels, setting markets on a hair trigger. Demand for many commodities is rising as developing countries like China and India become wealthier and buy ever more food and oil.
But other factors, like investor concerns about a weak dollar, oil disruptions in the Middle East and changing perceptions of the global economy, have also fed rapidly changing prices.
Hedge funds and other speculators have become an increasing force in the commodities futures market, attracted in part by a switch to computerized trading. Critics say the technological switch is altering the dynamics of the commodities markets, just as it has in the stock market, which suffered its own 600-point "flash crash" last May.
The traditional players like grain elevators or cotton merchants are being overshadowed by the new breed of financial speculators, including high-frequency traders, who use automated programs to buy and sell repeatedly at machine-gun speeds.
The exchanges, which profit from the increased trading levels, say high-frequency trading now makes up 10 to 20 percent of the futures trading in many agricultural commodities, nearly a quarter of the trading in metals and 30 percent in energy futures markets.
The roller-coaster ride is also reviving claims that commodity prices are being pushed around by the flood of billions of dollars into futures markets from so-called index funds. These funds have grown in popularity over the last decade, favored by ordinary investors as well as institutions like pension funds and university endowments, all of whom now regard commodities as financial investment assets and important protections against inflation.
A growing body of research into the last commodity price run-up, in 2008, has turned up little evidence that investment futures funds were a primary cause.
Nevertheless, many companies and traders believe that these index investment flows have significantly contributed to commodity price increases.
Whatever the cause, the result has been higher prices for consumers. "It is inevitable the consumer is going to pay more in a riskier, more volatile environment around commodities," said Troy Alstead, the chief financial officer of Starbucks. The coffee company raised the price of some drinks in its stores last fall and announced an average 12 percent rise in the price of its bagged coffees this spring.
A spokesman for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said that it was monitoring the markets but that volatility was an expected part of market dynamics.
However, it also has a real cost for many businesses.
In the meat industry, JBS, one of the country's biggest meat processors, traditionally insured against price swings by buying and selling futures on the Chicago Board of Trade.
But as futures have become less predictable, the company has tried to find other ways to manage its risk. It now often signs longer-term supply contracts with the cattle and hog producers it buys from and the supermarket chains it sells to, with provisions aimed at sharing the risk of rising costs.
"There is a premium that goes in because of the volatility of the marketplace," said Chandler Keys, vice president for government affairs and industry relations for JBS, which sells under such brands as Swift, Pilgrim and Country Pride. "We have to protect ourselves."
Chris L. Pieper, grain division manager of Farmers Cooperative, a grain elevator in Waverly, Neb., said that even small daily price movements added up because traders deal in huge amounts of goods.
"The volatility is really hard to outguess," he said.
In some cases, high volatility can be devastating. In 2008, in an earlier round of extreme volatility, several big cotton companies were forced out of business when they were unable to make enormous margin calls, which are increases in cash deposits required when futures contracts change in price.
According to Jerry Marshall of Yiyang Trading, a commodities trader and a former senior cotton trader at Cargill, the amount of money the exchanges require traders to post as collateral on futures contracts has risen drastically as volatility has grown.
The InterContinental Exchange requires from $6,000 to $8,400 in initial margin for each 50,000-pound cotton contract today. A year ago, the range was $1,500 to $2,100 per contract. Companies using the markets to hedge multiple contracts, which is typical, can quickly see their margin requirements swell into the hundreds of thousands of dollars or more.
Wallace L. Darneille, the chief executive of the Plains Cotton Cooperative Association, one of the biggest cotton producers in the United States, said the cooperative had cut back significantly on hedging with futures because of such concerns. "The market is broken," he said. "It no longer serves its purpose."
Thomas W. Farley, president of ICE Futures US, which operates exchanges that trade futures contracts for cotton, cocoa, coffee, sugar and orange juice, said the buyers and sellers of these commodities had complained loudly that price swings were making it harder for them to use the market. In response, the exchange is taking steps to deal with volatility, such as strengthening circuit-breakers to slow down rapid price swings.
But he said that supply and demand were responsible for price changes, not other factors like high-speed electronic trading, and that the exchanges were working well in difficult times.
"In the absence of a change to the macroeconomic factors that are causing this high volatility," Mr. Farley said, "this volatility is here to stay in these markets."

Full text: TO judge by the stock market, the recovery from the Great Recession is much stronger than the one after the early 1970s recession, which followed the first oil price shock.
But by most other measures, the current recovery is far weaker.
Those two downturns were the longest since the Great Depression. The country's economy took two years to regain its former size in the 1970s, and three years in the recent recession. In each case the stock market lost about half its value and then began a powerful rally a few months before the recession officially ended.
Just 26 months after the market hit its low in early 2009, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index had doubled, by the end of April. By contrast, the market took more than five years to double after it began to advance in late 1974.
Similarly, the manufacturing economy has rebounded sharply. Industrial production and durable goods orders have risen much more rapidly than they did in the earlier period.
Still, the overall economy, as measured by gross domestic product, rose less than 5 percent in the two years after the market hit bottom, compared with a gain of almost 7 percent during the comparable period in the 1970s.
Personal income, adjusted for inflation and excluding government transfer payments, is up less than half as much as it was in the earlier period. And while private sector employers added jobs at the fastest pace in five years over the last three months, there are still fewer jobs than there were when the stock market bottomed, according to Friday's employment report for April
One major reason for the slow recovery is that the construction industry continues to suffer. The financial crisis was caused in part by easy credit policies that caused overbuilding, and that led a deep and continuing fall in construction spending. The Census Bureau reported this week that spending ticked up in March, but that may have simply reflected an improvement in weather. The February figure had been the lowest for any month since 1999.
Those trends are shown in the accompanying charts, which show the changes for each measure from the time the stock market hit its low point.
The stock market recovery in many ways has been a mirror image of the fall from the market peak reached in the fall of 2007. Nearly every stock went down when the market was sliding, and nearly every stock has gone up during the rebound.
Of the 100 major stocks in the Standard & Poor's 100-stock index, 90 are up by at least a third since the market low. Financial stocks led the way down, and have led the way back up as well, although most are well below where they were when the crisis began.

Full text: AFTER more than a quarter-century as a professional economist, I have a confession to make: There is a lot I don't know about the economy. Indeed, the area of economics where I have devoted most of my energy and attention -- the ups and downs of the business cycle -- is where I find myself most often confronting important questions without obvious answers.
Now, if you follow economic commentary in the newspapers or the blogosphere, you have probably not run into many humble economists. By its nature, punditry craves attention, which is easier to attract with certainties than with equivocation.
But that certitude reflects bravado more often than true knowledge. So let me come clean and highlight three questions that perplex me. The answers to them may well shape the economy in the years to come.

How long will it take for the economy's wounds to heal?
When President Obama took office in 2009, his economic team projected a quick recovery from the recession the nation was experiencing. The administration's first official forecast said economic growth, computed from fourth quarter to fourth quarter, would average 3.5 percent in 2010 and 4.4 percent in 2011. Unemployment was supposed to fall to 7.7 percent by the end of 2010 and to 6.8 percent by the end of 2011.
The reality has turned out not nearly as rosy. Growth was only 2.8 percent last year, and the first quarter of this year came in at a meager rate of 1.8 percent. Unemployment, meanwhile, lingers well above 8 percent, and according to Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, is expected to keep doing so throughout this year.
Economists will long debate whether President Obama's policies are to blame or the patient was just sicker than his economists realized. But there is no doubt that the pace of this recovery will come nowhere close to matching the one achieved after the last deep recession, when President Ronald Reagan presided over a fall in the unemployment rate from 10.8 percent in December 1982 to 7.3 percent two years later.
Looking ahead, an open issue is whether the recession will leave scars that prevent a return to jobless rates that were considered normal just a few years ago. A striking feature of today's labor market is the rise of long-term joblessness. The average duration of unemployment is now almost 40 weeks, about twice what it reached in previous recessions. The long-term unemployed may well lose job skills and find their future prospects permanently impaired. But because we are in uncharted waters, it is hard for anyone to be sure.

How long will inflation expectations remain anchored?
In 1967, Milton Friedman gave an address to the American Economic Association with this simple but profound message: The inflation rate that the economy gets is, in large measure, based on the inflation rate that people expect. When everyone expects high inflation, workers bargain hard for wage increases, and companies push prices higher to keep up with the projected cost increases. When everyone expects inflation to be benign, workers and companies are less aggressive. In short, the perception of inflation -- or of the lack of it -- creates the reality.
Although novel when Professor Friedman proposed it, his theory is now textbook economics, and is at the heart of Federal Reserve policy. Fed policy makers are keeping interest rates low, despite soaring commodity prices. Why? Inflation expectations are "well anchored," we are told, so there is no continuing problem with inflation. Rising gasoline prices are just a transitory blip.
They are probably right, but there is still reason to wonder. Even if expectations are as important as the conventional canon presumes, it isn't obvious what determines those expectations. Are people merely backward-looking, extrapolating recent experience into the future? Or are the expectations based on the credibility of policy makers? And if credibility matters, how is it established? Are people making rational judgments, or are they easily overcome by fear and influenced by extraneous events?
Mr. Bernanke and his team may learn that, in turbulent times, expectations can become unmoored more easily than they think.

How long will the bond market trust the United States?
A remarkable feature of current financial markets is their willingness to lend to the federal government on favorable terms, despite a huge budget deficit, a fiscal trajectory that everyone knows is unsustainable and the failure of our political leaders to reach a consensus on how to change course. This can't go on forever -- that much is clear.
Less obvious, however, is how far we are from the day of reckoning.
Winston Churchill famously remarked that "Americans can always be counted on to do the right thing, after they have exhausted all other possibilities." That seems to capture the attitude of the bond market today. It trusts our leaders to get the government's fiscal house in order, eventually, and is waiting patiently while they exhaust the alternatives.
But such confidence in American rectitude will not last forever. The more we delay, the bigger the risk that we follow the path of Greece, Ireland and Portugal. I don't know how long we have before the bond market turns on the United States, but I would prefer not to run the experiment to find out.

So those are the three questions that puzzle me most as I read the daily news. If you find an economist who says he knows the answers, listen carefully, but be skeptical of everything you hear.

Full text: China has vowed to smooth relations with the United States. Since June, it has allowed its artificially cheap currency to rise about 5 percent against the dollar. Its huge trade surplus -- a drag on global growth -- has shrunk by half since its 2007 peak. During a January visit to Washington, President Hu Jintao promised to end software piracy by government agencies and procurement policies that discriminate against foreign companies. He even admitted that China had to make progress on human rights.
It still has a long way to go -- to win global respect or the trust and respect of its own people. When the Treasury secretary, Timothy Geithner, and the secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, meet their Chinese counterparts for their "Strategic and Economic Dialogue" this week, they need to deliver that message loud and clear.
China's human rights record has gotten worse, as its autocrats nervously watch the Middle East uprisings. Gary Locke, the commerce secretary, who is President Obama's choice to be the next ambassador to China, rightly criticized Beijing last week for failing to make good on commitments to level the playing field for foreign firms.
The list of complaints is long: 80 percent of the computer software in China is counterfeit. Beijing just published a new investment catalog that keeps a long list of industries off limits for American firms. It changed the investment vetting process to allow Chinese companies to recommend barring acquisitions by foreign rivals. It has done nothing to reduce the enormous subsidies in the form of cheap credit to favored state-owned firms.
In general, we agree with the Obama administration's patient yet persistent attempts to persuade China to address these economic distortions. Punitive legislation, like that often threatened by Congress, would only set off a destructive trade war. But Beijing's intrinsic conservatism has only gotten worse as the top leadership prepares for Mr. Hu to step down next year. With the world economy gradually on the mend, China's trade surplus could explode again and threaten a more long-lasting recovery.
The Obama administration must use whatever tools it has to urge China forward. It can keep reminding Beijing that reform is in China's own interest. Indeed, allowing its currency to rise faster would be the most effective way to head off inflation that is threatening the living standards of ordinary Chinese. If that logic does not change any minds, Washington has other leverage. China particularly covets a bilateral investment agreement that would ease the path for Chinese firms in the United States. It wants fewer restrictions on American technology exports.
The Obama administration must make clear that these things can happen only if China keeps its promises. If it wants to be treated as a regular market economy, it must behave like one.

Full text: 4:44 p.m. Updated
HSBC said on Monday that profit rose 58 percent in the first quarter after the quality of its loan portfolio improved.
Net income rose to $4.2 billion, from $2.6 billion in the period a year earlier, while charges for bad loans fell to $2.4 billion, from $3.8 billion. Profit at its investment banking unit fell.
Stuart T. Gulliver, the bank's chief executive, is scheduled to present a strategy overhaul to investors on Wednesday, including plans to reduce costs. Mr. Gulliver said on Monday that HSBC expected economic growth to slow this year from 2010.
"There remain a number of risks to the global recovery cycle in the short term," Mr. Gulliver said in a statement. "In the developed world, higher oil and food prices may slow the pace of recovery, while in emerging markets, higher inflation is dampening consumer sentiment."
Earnings in Hong Kong and the rest of the Asia-Pacific region continued to grow in the first quarter even as the bank, which is based in London, spent more on employees and marketing. HSBC does not report more detailed quarterly profit figures.
HSBC continued to reduce its consumer finance portfolio in the United States, and lending at its credit card business fell, the bank said. As a result, charges on bad loans fell by 30 percent. The business in North America remained profitable, but that profit fell 60 percent.
In Britain, HSBC set aside $440 million to cover possible claims by some customers that the bank had wrongly sold them a type of loan insurance. The step came after a British court ruled that several banks, including HSBC, were responsible for compensating customers. Barclays and the Lloyds Banking Group also made provision for such costs.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text: HONG KONG -- China's exports surged last month to a record level, as Chinese factories appear to have passed on rising costs to buyers who are finding that they have few alternatives in other countries.
China's imports lagged, causing its trade surplus to widen sharply from the first three months of this year, to $11.43 billion. That was lower than last year, but still high enough to increase trade frictions with the United States and other countries worried that China is using a weak currency to claim an unusually large share of global job creation as the world economy climbs out of the recent economic downturn.
China's regularly scheduled release of trade statistics came in between two days of negotiations in Washington between senior American and Chinese officials. In the first day of talks on Monday, American officials pressed China to improve its human rights record and allow interest rates and the Chinese currency to rise, while Chinese officials called on the United States to lead a global economic recovery and suggested that their shrinking trade surplus should not be a big concern.
China's General Administration of Customs said that exports rose 25.9 percent in April compared with a year earlier, to a record $155.69 billion, exceeding a previous record of $154.12 billion in December. The increase was somewhat surprising because the spring is traditionally a weak period for Chinese exports.
Chinese imports rose at a slower 21.8 percent, to $144.26 billion, as government policies took effect to restrict bank lending in an attempt to control inflation.
Labor costs are surging by 10 to 30 percent a year in China and commodity costs are rising around the world, leading to warnings by suppliers of Western retailers that price tags will start rising globally. Many companies are searching for alternatives to manufacturing in China, but finding that nowhere else offers China's combination of a large labor supply, world-class highways and ports and strongly pro-business policies, including a strict ban on independent labor unions that tended to hold down wages until very recently.
Josh Green, the chief executive of Panjiva, a New York company that advises 3,000 corporate buyers of goods from Asia, said his clients were extremely worried about the pace of price increases that they face from Chinese suppliers.
"That's all I've been hearing from them over the past year, is concern verging on panic about the changing cost structure in China," he said. "That has led to the hunt for the next China, which is a fool's errand."
Executives at three Chinese exporters said Tuesday that despite strong retail sales in the United States in April, they had not yet seen a sustained uptick in American orders, even as orders have risen from Europe and emerging markets. One reason might be that these and other exporters are now steadily marking up their prices to reflect the gradual appreciation of the renminbi, which has climbed 5 percent against the dollar since last summer.
"I am not worried about the rise of the renminbi since our company makes an adjustment every three months in the exchange rate used in our contracts," said Mabel Lee, the sales manager at the Foshan Summit Sanitary Ware Company, a maker of bathtubs of toilets based in Foshan, in southern China's Guangdong Province.

Critics Fear G.O.P.'s Proposed Medicaid Changes Could Cut Coverage for the Aged

Abstract: According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, which analyzes health care issues, 7 of 10 nursing home residents are on Medicaid, in large part because even middle-class patients often run through their savings while in a nursing home and turn to the entitlement program.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- As Republicans inch away from their plan to reshape the nation's Medicare program, their equally transformative ideas for Medicaid, now largely in the shadows of the budget debate, are moving front and center.
While the largest number of Medicaid recipients are low-income children and adults, who tend to be far less politically potent voices in battles over entitlement programs than older voters, the changes to Medicaid proposed by Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the House budget chairman, could actually have a more direct impact on older Americans than the Medicare part of his plan.
The House plan would turn Medicaid, which provides health coverage for the poor through a combination of federal and state money, into a block grant program for states. The federal government would give lump sums to states, which in turn would be given more flexibility and independence over use of the money, though the plan does not spell out what the federal requirements would be.
Beginning in 2013, these grants would increase annually at the rate of inflation, with adjustments for population growth, a rate far below that of inflation for health care costs. As a result, states, which have said that they cannot afford to keep up with the program's costs, are likely to scale back coverage. Such a reduction, critics fear, could have a disproportionate effect on Medicaid spending for nursing home care for the elderly or disabled.
By contrast, under the Medicare proposal approved by the House, no one currently 55 or older would see a change in benefits, which the House proposed to turn into a voucher-type program.
"This is a huge deal for the nation's seniors, and it's been largely unrecognized," said Jocelyn Guyer, the co-executive director of the Center for Children and Families at the Georgetown University Health Policy Institute. "Obviously Medicaid is a program designed for low- and modest-income people. But when it comes to nursing homes, a lot of seniors start off middle class and pay for their care with private funds but end up using the Medicaid program."
According to the Congressional Budget Office, in the 2010 fiscal year, 77 percent of people enrolled in Medicaid were children and families, while 23 percent were elderly or disabled. But 64 percent of Medicaid spending was for older Americans and people with disabilities, while 36 percent went to children and families.
According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, which analyzes health care issues, 7 of 10 nursing home residents are on Medicaid, in large part because even middle-class patients often run through their savings while in a nursing home and turn to the entitlement program.
The foundation recently estimated that a Medicaid block grant similar to the one proposed by Mr. Ryan could save $750 billion over 10 years. House Republicans also want to eliminate the expansion in Medicaid eligibility scheduled to take place in 2014 under the new health care law, which could result in savings of $610 billion.
According to a report released Tuesday by the foundation with the Urban Institute, by 2012, under the Ryan plan, Medicaid enrollment nationally could be 44 million people fewer than what it is projected to be under current law, which includes new additions to the program under the health care overhaul.
It is still possible that there will be some changes to the Medicare program this year, but Medicaid is quite likely a more politically viable area of change. Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the House majority leader, said Tuesday, "Medicaid is a very important part of our plan."
While the House passed the Ryan 2012 budget that includes changes to Medicare and Medicaid, it is dead on arrival in the Senate.
Another budget proposal offered Tuesday by Senator Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, increases Medicare spending, while using block grants for Medicaid in an effort to reduce Medicaid spending by 2019 to a level only $14 billion above what it was in the 2008 fiscal year.
It is likely that Democrats will strongly oppose block grants, arguing that such a plan would shift too many Medicaid costs to states that are already slashing their budgets. At a news conference last week, Senator John D. Rockefeller IV of West Virginia sharply criticized several of the ideas for reshaping Medicaid, calling broad-based cuts "almost beyond my moral understanding."

Full text: Prices of goods imported into the United States rose 2.2 percent in April, more than forecast, as a slumping dollar and growing economies overseas pushed up the cost of fuel and food.
The increase in the import-price index came after a revised 2.6 percent gain in March, according to figures from the Labor Department on Tuesday. Other reports showed distributors raised inventories and small businesses lost confidence.
The median forecast of 51 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News called for a 1.8 percent increase in import prices last month. Projections ranged from increases of 1 percent to 2.5 percent.
Compared with a year earlier, import prices increased 11 percent, exceeding the 10 percent increase projected by economists surveyed and the biggest 12-month gain in a year.
The increase in prices from overseas may put pressure on companies to pass on higher costs. The report on small businesses showed the share of those surveyed who planned to raise prices held in April at the highest level in 30 months.
"While many policy makers have described recent commodity cost increases as 'transitory,' the reality is that even at the small-business level, producers are increasingly more confident in their ability to pass on costs to customers," Joseph LaVorgna, chief United States economist at Deutsche Bank Securities in New York, said in a note to clients.
After a two-day meeting in Washington last month, Fed officials said the effect on inflation from the jump in fuel and other commodities will probably be "transitory," according to a statement released April 27.
The officials also lowered their forecasts for growth, saying the economy is recovering at a "moderate pace," and agreed to finish $600 billion of bond purchases on schedule in June.
Confidence among small companies fell to a seven-month low in April, damped by a deteriorating outlook for the economy, a report from the National Federation of Independent Business showed. The group's optimism index decreased to 91.2, the lowest since September, from 91.9 the prior month. Seven of the measure's 10 components dropped.
Small businesses planning to increase prices held at a net 24 percent of owners for a second month, according to the report.
Increasing sales are also prompting wholesalers to increase stockpiles, according to figures from the Commerce Department. Inventories climbed 1.1 percent in March as sales jumped 2.9 percent. At the current pace of sales, distributors had enough goods on hand to last 1.13 months, matching the level in June 2008 as the lowest on record.
The report on prices from overseas showed the cost of imported oil increased 7.2 percent from the previous month and was up 37 percent from a year earlier. Excluding all fuels, import prices climbed 4.3 percent from April 2010, matching the prior month's 12-month increase as the biggest since October 2008.
Imported food was 1.8 percent costlier last month and was up 20 percent from a year earlier, the biggest 12-month increase since records began in 1977.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Two days of high-level talks between the United States and China wrapped up Tuesday with both sides hailing modest progress on economic issues even as they traded harsh words about China's respect for human rights.
The grand scope and pomp of the talks, which have become an annual event involving hundreds of politicians, bureaucrats, generals and business executives, stood in striking contrast to the limited results, which included a Chinese promise to prevent government agencies from using pirated software.
But both sides insisted in closing speeches Tuesday that meeting and talking in themselves were sufficient achievements, because they could lay the groundwork for grander bargains.
"As we say in China, spiritual things can be turned into material ones," said Cui Tiankai, vice minister of foreign affairs, describing the value of improved relations.
The meetings, which began in 2006 over solely economic issues, have expanded steadily to encompass the full range of the countries' relationship, including talks between military leaders for the first time this year.
The issue of human rights shadowed the meetings. Chastising the Chinese is a political necessity for American officials, but both Hillary Rodham Clinton, the secretary of state, and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. carefully measured their criticism in public remarks on Monday.
Then, in an interview published Tuesday on The Atlantic's Web site, Mrs. Clinton went much further, calling China's record on human rights "deplorable" and suggesting that a popular demand for democracy eventually would unseat China's rulers, just as it had undermined several governments in the Middle East and North Africa.
"They're worried, and they are trying to stop history, which is a fool's errand," she told the magazine, speaking of the government's crackdown in response to the democracy demonstrations in the Arab world. "They cannot do it. But they're going to hold it off as long as possible."
Asked about the issue later on Tuesday in the presence of Chinese officials, Mrs. Clinton was again more measured, saying that every nation was different but that she had discussed the uprisings with the Chinese.
Mr. Cui responded on Tuesday, saying that the reason other countries raise the issue of human rights in China "is probably that they are trying to make some political gains and hoping that this can draw attention from the press.
"Human rights in China has made historic progress in the last few decades," Mr. Cui said. He added that every country, including the United States, needed to keep making progress.
Meanwhile the two countries continue to deepen economic ties.
The Bush administration initiated these meetings, recognizing that the Chinese wanted the United States to demonstrate greater respect for their emerging power and hoping to break longstanding deadlocks on significant issues.
The focus initially was almost entirely on America's lopsided trade relationship with China, which sends much of its goods to the United States and buys relatively little in return. American officials contend that China suppresses the value of its currency to help preserve this imbalance, and have pressed China for years to let the currency rise in value.
But those issues have somewhat receded in importance lately as China has allowed its currency to rise against the dollar by about 10 percent, including inflation. American exports to China have also grown rapidly.
"We are seeing very promising shifts in the direction of Chinese economic policy," Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said Tuesday.
Just before the second day of talks, which focused on the balance of trade between the countries, China published monthly data showing its exports exceeded imports by $11.43 billion in April, a sharp increase from the first three months of the year. A senior Treasury official said policy makers did not focus on monthly fluctuations, however, and continued to see a positive trend in the balance of trade.
American officials also hailed progress on smaller issues.
The Chinese government agreed, for example, to make it easier for foreign companies to win government contracts by eliminating a system of preferences for products listed in special directories -- generally those made by Chinese companies.
John Frisbie, president of the US-China Business Council, which represents the interests of American companies in China, said 25 percent of the group's member companies had lost government contracts in the last year because of the policy.
"I think the dialogue showed again why engagement with China mattered, because there were results that were important for U.S. companies," Mr. Frisbie said.
American officials also pressed China to adopt financial reforms aimed at increasing domestic consumption as an alternative to economic growth fueled by exports. Here, too, the two sides reported small steps, including a pledge "to advance toward allowing" foreign companies to sell auto insurance in China, which is now the world's largest market.

Abstract: The FTSE 100 slipped and the pound rose against the dollar, jumping to $1.6476 from $1.6367, on expectations that the bank would raise its main interest rate target this year from the current level of 0.5 percent, a record low, where it has stood since March 2009. Because of increasing energy prices, consumer price inflation "is likely to rise further this year and is more likely than not to remain above the target throughout 2012," the central bank said.

Full text: The Bank of England warned Wednesday that inflation in Britain could hit 5 percent this year, raising the likelihood that the central bank would lift its main interest rate from the record low level at which it has stood since the depths of the financial crisis.
The bank also said the British economy was not growing as fast as it had expected, as "the continuing squeeze on households' real incomes is likely to weigh on demand, especially over the next year or so."
"Although inflation fell to 4 percent in March, it remains uncomfortably high and well above the 2 percent target," Mervyn A. King , the central bank governor, said at a news conference in London. "And there is a good chance that if utility prices rise further later in the year, inflation will reach 5 percent before falling back through 2012 and into 2013."
Mr. King said that inflation was being driven primarily by higher prices for commodities and imports, as well as an increase in Britain's value-added tax. Considering the sensitivity of inflation to such factors and recent volatility in commodity prices, he said, "there is a great deal of uncertainty in the outlook for inflation."
The FTSE 100 slipped and the pound rose against the dollar, jumping to $1.6476 from $1.6367, on expectations that the bank would raise its main interest rate target this year from the current level of 0.5 percent, a record low, where it has stood since March 2009.
Because of increasing energy prices, consumer price inflation "is likely to rise further this year and is more likely than not to remain above the target throughout 2012," the central bank said.
The latest data suggests the committee will make its first interest rate increase in the second half of 2011, possibly in August or November, Simon Hayes, an economist with Barclays Capital in London, wrote in a research note. Referring to the Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee, he wrote, "We believe most M.P.C. members will want to take the opportunity to move away from the current extremely loose policy setting, which, after all, was adopted as an emergency measure."
The committee, Mr. Hayes wrote, "has become increasingly uncomfortable with the fact that it keeps pushing out the point at which inflation returns to target," and "the current policy setting looks increasingly unlikely to generate the necessary drop at any reasonable time horizon."
In the 17 nations of the euro zone, prices at the consumer level rose 2.7 percent in March from a year earlier, above the European Central Bank's 2 percent target and matching the March rise in the United States.
Inflation in China is running at more than 5 percent.
The European Central Bank has already raised its main rate once this year and has signaled that another increase could come in July.

Full text: John Chambers and Steve Ballmer have much in common. For more than a decade, both have run dominant, rapidly maturing tech juggernauts -- Mr. Chambers at Cisco Systems and Mr. Ballmer at Microsoft. And both have let down their shareholders. The difference is that one seems to have recognized the error of his ways and is repenting.
After years of frittering away Cisco's cash on acquisitions and overpriced stock buybacks, Mr. Chambers has gotten religion. He is paring back the company to focus on its core networking businesses and streamlining management ranks. As he said on Wednesday, "We have acknowledged our challenges. We know what we have to do."
Cisco has instituted a dividend. And if he can resist more of the shopping excursions that led him to spend $34 billion in the last decade, he may even manage to kick-start his stock after 10 years of directionless returns.
Compare that with Mr. Ballmer. A day before Cisco released its third-quarter results, Microsoft agreed to spend $8.5 billion on Skype. Without a serious financial rationale for the purchase of the Internet telephone company at 10 times sales, Microsoft took another leap into what Cisco's Mr. Chambers used to call "market adjacencies."
There may be some Skype synergy with Microsoft's many products. But they are fuzzy, in the same way that Cisco's lurch into the consumer business with the acquisition of cable set-top boxes and handheld video cameras was.
So what has made Mr. Chambers see the light, while Mr. Ballmer continues building an empire of adjacencies? After all, Microsoft's stock has underperformed Cisco's over the last 10 years. It is down more than 25 percent, three times the drop in Cisco's stock -- though admittedly Mr. Ballmer instituted dividends years ago, which has made the total return less disappointing for investors.
One simple explanation lies in the shareholder base. Mr. Chambers's decision to revamp the company came with activist investors circling. With no single major shareholder to protect him, Mr. Chambers grasped the risks of inaction.
Microsoft's ownership, by contrast, is still dominated by its chairman and co-founder, Bill Gates. He and Mr. Ballmer own about $20 billion of Microsoft stock, giving them a combined stake bigger than 10 percent -- something no outside investor could amass. With insulation like that, it's no surprise Mr. Ballmer is still able to run amok.
Booming Exports
Has the global economy hit a soft patch? A week after a sell-off skimmed froth from bubbly commodities markets, China reported a tiny decline in inflation. But any impression that the global economy is cooling, and the conclusion that monetary policy tightening can be deferred, is wrong. Inflationary pressures still need to be checked.
China's annual rate of inflation moderated to 5.3 percent in April, from 5.4 percent the month before. But that is still very high, and inflationary forces are plain to see. Wages in China are widely reported to be rising at double-digit rates. The country's currency is appreciating at only a slow pace against the dollar. The latest huge trade surplus suggests foreign exchange reserves will keep booming, and with them the money supply.
Record export figures provide further confirmation that the global recovery is firmly on track. China's exports were up a staggering 29.9 percent in April from a year earlier.
Meanwhile, exports out of Germany were up by 19.9 percent in March compared with a year earlier. They are also well above the record set in April 2008.
Rapid export growth is adding to inflationary pressure in Germany, too. German consumers are spending and inflation has jumped to 2.7 percent. Price increases in the euro zone over all are also heading toward 3 percent. The European Central Bank will need to raise interest rates. It cannot afford to let inflation soar in the core economies of the region despite the troubles of some peripheral member states.
Investors and some policy makers keep seeing soft patches in the worldwide recovery. The reality is that limited monetary policy tightening by a few central banks hasn't checked global growth much.
The German and Chinese export booms ought to be echoing loudly worldwide. Interest rates in most economies remain negative in real terms. The mix of strong demand and easy money suggests higher rates will be needed to prevent commodities flying again and inflation soaring. The hard data doesn't look so soft at all.

U.S. Exports Rose in March, But Trade Gap Still Widened

Full text: WASHINGTON (AP) -- American companies in March sold the most goods and services overseas in nearly two decades, but a jump in oil prices pushed the nation's trade deficit higher.
The trade deficit rose 6 percent to $48.2 billion, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. That was the highest level since June 2010.
Exports increased to $172.7 billion, the most on records dating back to 1992. A weaker dollar has made American goods cheaper overseas. Exports have also risen because of rapid growth in developing countries. Companies exported more autos, chemicals and agricultural goods in March.
The United States reported its trade deficit one day after Beijing announced an $11.4 billion trade surplus for April. The disparity will probably escalate pressure on Beijing to let its currency rise to help narrow the trade gap.
Many American manufacturers accuse China of keeping its currency low to gain a trade advantage. A cheaper currency makes its exports cheaper in the United States and increases the cost of American goods in China.
Still, American exports will probably help increase economic growth in the January-to-March quarter. Economists say the government will probably revise growth upward -- to 1.9 percent -- when it issues its second estimate later this month.
"The details in the report are encouraging for economic momentum," said Joseph LaVorgna, an economist at Deutsche Bank, in a note to clients.
The biggest factor affecting the trade deficit is the price of oil. Oil imports rose to $39.3 billion, an 18 percent increase from the previous month. It was the highest level since August 2008 and reflected steep price increases, as well as greater demand. Excluding oil imports, the deficit narrowed.
The average price for a barrel of imported crude oil was $93.76 in March, up nearly 7.6 percent from February. Oil prices have risen even further since then, despite declines in recent days.
Economic growth generally slows when imports outpace exports, because more jobs go to foreign workers.
Still, economists expect the rapid rise in exports to increase growth in the April-to-June quarter, even with high oil prices. That is because the government adjusts for inflation when calculating the nation's gross domestic product.
The trade deficit with China, meanwhile, decreased slightly from February, to $18.1 billion. But it is still the largest deficit the United States has with any country, and it is expected to rise in the coming months.
On Tuesday, China reported that its imports rose at a slower pace in April than the previous month, while exports increased 30 percent. Its surplus with the United States rose to $15.1 billion, 52 percent higher than a year ago.
The trade gap between the two countries was a top issue at high-level meetings between United States and Chinese officials this week. But American manufacturers were disappointed in the outcome of the talks, arguing that they would not do much to reduce the nation's deficit with China.
Imports from Japan rose $1.3 billion, and American exports to that country also increased. But disruptions to Japan's auto production are likely to reduce American imports in coming months, economists say.

Full text: Stock markets in the United States rose while the dollar fell and commodities rebounded from an early slump led by China's efforts to curb lending.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 0.49 percent, or 6.57 points, to 1,348.65, reversing a decline from earlier in the day. The Dow Jones industrial average added 65.89 points, or 0.52 percent, to 12,695.92. The Dollar Index, which tracks the currency against the currencies of six major trading partners, declined 0.2 percent, to 75.19. The Nasdaq rose 17.98 points, or 0.63 percent, to 2,863.04.
"The more commodity-sensitive industries have been driving the market either up or down," said Wasif Latif, vice president for equity investments at USAA Investment Management in San Antonio. "One sector's gain could be another sector's pain. The recent decline in oil may not be that good for energy companies. However, consumer staples will do better because of lower input costs."
The S.& P. 500 has fallen 1.1 percent this month as gauges of energy and raw materials producers have slumped at least 4.2 percent. Still, the index is up 7.2 percent this year amid government stimulus measures and higher-than-estimated profits.
Earlier in the day, stocks fell after China raised reserve ratios for its largest lenders by 0.5 percentage point to a record 21 percent. The central bank's announcement followed reports on Wednesday showing inflation and lending exceeded economists' estimates in April, with consumer prices rising more than 5 percent for a second month.
Commodities rebounded from earlier losses as the dollar reversed a gain, bolstering the appeal of energy and raw-materials as alternative investments.
Cliffs Natural Resources, a large iron-ore producer, gained 1.7 percent to $87.19. Schlumberger, the oil-field services provider, added 1.5 percent to $83.52.
Symantec climbed 5.2 percent to $20.42. The company, a maker of security software, forecast higher revenue than analysts had predicted, bolstered by demand for data backup cloud-computing programs, and the effect of a weaker dollar on overseas sales.
Tyson added 4.6 percent, to $18.84, after it said it planned to buy back up to 22.5 million shares.
Cisco Systems tumbled 4.8 percent to $16.93. The company is revamping management and scaling back some businesses after losing share to rivals like Hewlett-Packard.
The yield on Treasury's 10-year note rose to 3.22 percent, from 3.16 percent late Wednesday.

Full text: The nation's major health insurers are barreling into a third year of record profits, enriched in recent months by a lingering recessionary mind-set among Americans who are postponing or forgoing medical care.
The UnitedHealth Group, one of the largest commercial insurers, told analysts that so far this year, insured hospital stays actually decreased in some instances. In reporting its earnings last week, Cigna, another insurer, talked about the "low level" of medical use.
Yet the companies continue to press for higher premiums, even though their reserve coffers are flush with profits and shareholders have been rewarded with new dividends. Many defend proposed double-digit increases in the rates they charge, citing a need for protection against any sudden uptick in demand once people have more money to spend on their health, as well as the rising price of care.
Even with a halting economic recovery, doctors and others say many people are still extremely budget-conscious, signaling the possibility of a fundamental change in Americans' appetite for health care.
"I am noticing my patients with insurance are more interested in costs," said Dr. Jim King, a family practice physician in rural Tennessee. "Gas prices are going up, food prices are going up. They are deciding to put some of their health care off." A patient might decide not to drive the 50 miles necessary to see a specialist because of the cost of gas, he said.
But Dr. King said patients were also being more thoughtful about their needs. Fewer are asking for an MRI as soon as they have a bad headache. "People are realizing that this is my money, even if I'm not writing a check," he said.
For someone like Shannon Hardin of California, whose hours at a grocery store have been erratic, there is simply no spare cash to see the doctor when she isn't feeling well or to get the $350 dental crowns she has been putting off since last year. Even with insurance, she said, "I can't afford to use it." Delaying care could keep utilization rates for insurers low through the rest of the year, according to Charles Boorady, an analyst for Credit Suisse. "The big question is whether it is going to stay weak or bounce back," he said. "Nobody knows."
Significant increases in how much people have to pay for their medical care may prevent a solid rebound. In recent years, many employers have sharply reduced benefits, while raising deductibles and co-payments so people have to reach deeper into their pockets.
In 2010, about 10 percent of people covered by their employer had a deductible of at least $2,000, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit research group, compared with just 5 percent of covered workers in 2008.
Doctors, for one, say patients' attitudes are changing. "Because it's from Dollar 1 to Dollar 2,000, they are being really conscious of how they spend their money," said Dr. James Applegate, a family physician in Grand Rapids, Mich. For example, patients question the need for annual blood work.
High deductibles also can be daunting. David Welch, a nurse in California whose policy has a $4,000 deductible, said he was surprised to realize he had delayed going to the dermatologist, even though he had a history of skin cancer. Mr. Welch, who has been a supporter of the need to overhaul insurance industry practices for the California Nurses Association union, said he hoped his medical training would help him determine when to go to the doctor. "I underestimated how much that cost would affect my behavior," he said.
Dr. Rebecca Jaffe, a family practice doctor in Wilmington, Del., said more patients were asking for the generic alternatives to brand-name medicines, because of hefty co-payments. "Now, all of a sudden, they want the generic, when for years, they said they couldn't take it," she said.
The insurers, which base what they charge in premiums largely on what they expect to pay out in future claims, say they still expect higher demand for care later this year. "I think there's a real concern about a bounce-back, a rebound, in utilization," said Dr. Lonny Reisman, the chief medical officer for Aetna.
Because they say they expect costs to rebound, insurers have not been shy about asking for higher rates. In Oregon, for example, Regence BlueCross BlueShield, a nonprofit insurer that is the state's largest, is asking for a 22 percent increase for policies sold to individuals. In California, regulators have been resisting requests from insurers to raise rates by double digits.
Some observers wonder if the insurers are simply raising premiums in advance of the full force of the health care law in 2014. The insurers' recent prosperity -- big insurance companies have reported first-quarter earnings that beat analysts expectations by an average of 30 percent -- may make it difficult for anyone, politicians and industry executives alike, to argue that the industry has been hurt by the federal health care law. Insurers were able to raise premiums to cover the cost of the law's early provisions, like insuring adult children up to age 26, and federal and state regulators have largely proved to be accommodating.
But 2014 and 2015 are likely to be far more challenging, as insurers are forced to adjust to the law's greatest changes, like providing coverage to everyone regardless of whether they have an expensive pre-existing condition. "I think they're going to go through a winter," said Paul H. Keckley, executive director of the Deloitte Center for Health Solutions, a research unit of the consulting firm Deloitte.
And while the slowing down of demand is good for insurers, at least in the short term, the concern is that patients may be tempted to skip important tests like colonoscopies or mammograms. The new health care law will eventually prevent most policies from charging patients for certain kinds of preventive care, but some plans still require someone to pay $500 toward a colonoscopy.
In recent times, insurers have prospered by pricing policies above costs, said Robert Laszewski, a former health insurance executive who is now a consultant in Alexandria, Va. The industry goes through underwriting cycles where the companies are better able to predict costs and make room for profits. "They're benefiting from a very positive underwriting cycle," he said.
"Maybe managed care is finally working," he said. "Maybe this is the new normal."
Still, he emphasized, health care costs, even if they are rising at 6 percent or 7 percent a year, are increasing at a much faster pace than overall inflation. "We haven't solved the problem," Mr. Laszewski said.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The financial outlook for Medicare deteriorated in the last year because of the sluggish economic recovery, and the program's hospital insurance trust fund will be exhausted in 2024, five years earlier than projected last year, the government said Friday.
The estimates, in the annual report by the Medicare trustees, were immediately swept up into the already inflamed political battle over federal spending, debt and the future of entitlement programs.
The trustees said that payroll tax revenues, which provide most of the money for Medicare's hospital insurance trust fund, were lower than expected last year because earnings were "considerably lower than projected" and the economy was weaker than expected.
Republicans said the bleaker picture for Medicare showed a need for immediate action to shore up the finances of the program, which insures 47.5 million people who are 65 and older or disabled.
"The biggest threat Medicare faces right now is the status quo," said the House speaker, John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio. "The trustees' report makes it clear that if we do nothing, Medicare will not be able to pay promised benefits to American seniors."
Democrats said that the financial outlook for Medicare would have been much worse without the new health care law. The law, which President Obama cites as one of his greatest political accomplishments, promises to be a central point of conflict in the 2012 presidential election.
Without the new law, said Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services, "Medicare would have gone bankrupt in 2016, only five years from now."
Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said, "The current economic crisis has hit the Medicare trust fund, and hit it hard." Mr. Baucus, an architect of the new law, and other Democrats vowed to resist Republican efforts to repeal it.
The trustees said the financial outlook for Social Security had changed little. They said the Social Security trust fund would be exhausted in 2036, one year sooner than projected in last year's report, and even then, they said, tax revenue would be sufficient to pay three-fourths of promised benefits through 2085.
It is inconceivable that politicians would allow either program to run out of money. The projected dates of insolvency are widely used as a measure of the financial condition of Social Security and Medicare, which together account for more than one-third of all federal spending.
In unveiling the new estimates, Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, the managing trustee of the trust funds, noted the need for additional borrowing to keep the government's myriad commitments in other programs.
"On Monday," Mr. Geithner said, "just three days from today, the United States will reach the debt limit set by Congress. Because Congress has not yet acted, we have now set in motion a series of extraordinary measures that will give Congress some additional time to raise the debt limit."
As a condition of increasing the debt limit, many Republicans are demanding changes in benefit programs. But House Republicans have discovered that they are playing with political dynamite when they propose major changes in Medicare.
The reports were signed by the six trustees: three cabinet officers, the Social Security commissioner and two public representatives.
The Medicare report included a disclaimer by the chief Medicare actuary, Richard S. Foster. "The financial projections shown in this report for Medicare do not represent a reasonable expectation for actual program operations" in the short term or the long range, said Mr. Foster, a civil servant whose independence is protected by law.
The projections assume that Medicare will cut doctors' fees by 29 percent on Jan. 1, as required under current law, but Congress routinely intercedes to block such cuts.
Moreover, the report says that projected Medicare costs over 75 years are about 25 percent lower because of the new health care law.
Under the law, Medicare will hold down payments to hospitals and other health care providers to reflect presumed increases in productivity. But, Mr. Foster said, if these constraints are kept in place, Medicare payments to providers will eventually be "far below the levels paid by private health insurance."
"Well before that point," Mr. Foster added, "Congress would have to intervene to prevent the withdrawal of providers from the Medicare market and the severe problems with beneficiary access to care that would result." This, in turn, would "lead to far higher costs for Medicare in the long range than those projected" in the report, he said.
The report on Social Security predicts that beneficiaries will receive a cost-of-living increase of seven-tenths of one percent in 2012. Because of low inflation, beneficiaries did not receive increases this year or in 2010.
Turning to the long-range outlook for Social Security, the trustees said the gap between income and costs over the next 75 years would be somewhat larger than projected in last year's report. One reason is that the trustees now believe that people will live longer, thus lowering mortality rates for the population 65 and older.
Population experts have said for some years that Social Security was underestimating gains in life spans likely to occur in the 21st century.
The trustees also revised their estimates of immigration. Because of the weak economy, they said, the number of immigrants entering the United States is assumed to be lower than in last year's report. This adversely affects the long-range financial outlook for Social Security because "immigration occurs at relatively young ages," and taxes paid by immigrant workers help finance Social Security benefits for retirees.
The trustees sounded an alarm about financial problems in Social Security's disability insurance program. The trust fund for this program will be exhausted in 2018, they said, "so legislative action will be needed as soon as possible."
In a joint statement, the two public trustees, Charles P. Blahous III and Robert D. Reischauer , warned, "The financial shortfalls confronting both Social Security and Medicare are substantial and -- absent legislation to correct them -- quite certain."

Full text: Consumers continued to feel the pinch at grocery stores and gasoline stations in April as a widely used index of inflation rose at the fastest 12-month rate since the later part of 2008, according to government figures released on Friday.
The Labor Department said in its monthly report that the Consumer Price Index, the most widely used measure of inflation, was up 0.4 percent in April from March, and up 3.2 percent from a year earlier. The 12-month figure represents the biggest increase in the index in any 12-month period since October 2008.
Analysts had forecast the same monthly rise but a slightly smaller increase for the year, at 3.1 percent.
Food and gasoline price rises accounted for most of the increases, with gasoline accounting for almost half of the month-to-month rise.
Food prices were up 0.4 percent in April, smaller than the 0.8 percent rise in March as prices for fresh vegetables slowed their advance. Energy prices rose 2.2 percent in April, the 10th consecutive monthly increase, although the rise was smaller than the jumps of 3.5 percent in March and 3.4 percent in February, the report said.
Gasoline prices were up 3.3 percent in April. According to the report, energy prices have now risen 19 percent over the last 12 months, with gasoline prices up 33.1 percent.
Consumers are "painfully aware" that if high energy and food costs continue, "the cost of living is going to go up," said Stuart Hoffman, the chief economist at the PNC Financial Services Group.
Inflation as measured by the core C.P.I., which strips out volatile prices for energy and food, edged up 0.2 percent in April, making it the third increase of that size in the last four months, the department's Bureau of Labor Statistics said.
Housing and apparel prices each climbed by 0.2 percent, the figures showed.
Core inflation was up 1.3 percent from a year earlier, the department said. The core index, which was also in line with analysts' forecasts, was also pushed up by rises in the prices of new vehicles, shelter, medical care and airline tickets.
"I think that you are seeing inflation drift higher," said Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist at MFR Inc. "On the core side it is a slow drift, but it is nonetheless there. What will be important to the Fed is the mix between inflation and real growth."
Many economists expect gasoline prices to ease over the summer. But in some regions of the country, consumers have been paying $4 or more a gallon at the pump since demand in emerging markets and turmoil in the Middle East and North Africa in the first quarter of the year sent prices higher. While consumers are feeling the strain, economists emphasized that the Federal Reserve was unlikely to take any action to relieve it by lowering interest rates or extending its quantitative easing program.
The Fed has raised its forecast of inflation, projecting that prices could rise 2.1 to 2.8 percent this year, mostly because of higher oil prices, although it stressed that those increases would subside. In April, the Fed's policy-making body voted to continue several stimulus policies, like keeping short-term interest rates near zero. In a statement, the committee said it expected inflation from higher prices in energy and other commodities to be "transitory."
Mr. Hoffman said core inflation, which is the rate the Fed focuses on, had edged up in the last year, meaning the Fed could put deflation concerns behind it. The 1.3 percent rate in the latest report was still below the unofficial target of the central bank of 2 percent or less.
"It is still not of concern to the Fed," Mr. Hoffman said. "We are sort of in the middle, not going up too fast to worry the Fed about inflation."

Suddenly, Gold Isn't Looking So Solid

Abstract: Yet after the wrenching sell-off and burst of unusually high volatility in the commodity markets this month, should gold and other commodities even be a part of a typical investment portfolio? [...] despite the yellow metal's sometimes mythic appeal -- well documented in Peter L. Bernstein's classic, "The Power of Gold," which recounts the Ruskin parable -- it is in many ways now just another commodity, like oil, silver, wheat or pork bellies, subject to the vagaries of the markets and, recently, to an extraordinary level of volatility.

Full text: A RICH man carrying a heavy bag of gold coins set sail on a voyage, but his ship ran into stormy weather. Before it capsized, he attached the bag of gold to his waist and jumped overboard. He sank with his fortune, never to be seen again.
"Now, as he was sinking, had he the gold? Or had the gold him?"
The English critic John Ruskin wrote this parable more than a century ago, but it raises a question that investors may wisely ask today. Many people have tied their portfolios, if not their very lives, to gold. Yet after the wrenching sell-off and burst of unusually high volatility in the commodity markets this month, should gold and other commodities even be a part of a typical investment portfolio?
Although gold is certainly alluring, the answer isn't simple.
That gold has been wildly popular -- at least until commodity markets plunged -- is indisputable, and not just because of its gleaming beauty. It served, after all, as the immutable standard of the global monetary system until the 1970s, a status that has helped give it a certain appeal in an era of wildly fluctuating financial values.
As a measure of gold's acceptance as a mainstream investment, a gold exchange-traded fund -- SPDR Gold Shares, offered by State Street Global Advisors -- was the second-most-popular E.T.F. in the United States on April 30, trailing only State Street's flagship, the SPDR S.& P. 500 fund.
But despite the yellow metal's sometimes mythic appeal -- well documented in Peter L. Bernstein's classic, "The Power of Gold," which recounts the Ruskin parable -- it is in many ways now just another commodity, like oil, silver, wheat or pork bellies, subject to the vagaries of the markets and, recently, to an extraordinary level of volatility.
It has been behaving much more sedately than its sister metal, silver, which has lost more than a quarter of its value this month, after rising nearly 400 percent since October 2008. But gold has not been a paragon of stable value. It has dropped more than 4 percent this month after more than doubling in value since October 2008.
Which brings us back to the question: Does it make sense for a long-term investor to join in this jolting race?
Leading asset management firms provide very different answers. T. Rowe Price and Fidelity, for example, include allocations of gold and other commodities in their target-date mutual funds -- standard portfolios that are intended to be all an investor needs until retirement or later. "We think that in moderation, in a well-diversified portfolio, getting exposure to what we call 'real assets' is useful," said Richard Fullmer, an asset allocation strategist at T. Rowe Price.
But Vanguard does not include gold or any other commodity in its target-date retirement funds or any other core funds. For a basic portfolio, it considers them superfluous and highly volatile.
"We recognize that some people may want an exposure to gold for their own reasons, and that's fine if they do," said Fran Kinniry, principal at Vanguard's Investment Strategy Group. "But we've found that for the typical investor, you can get all the diversification you need without including any commodities at all."
In a strict sense, commodities may not even be an investment asset class , because they don't produce any cash flow or earnings or dividends. That's the view of Gary P. Brinson, a scholar and veteran strategist based in Chicago.
"A bar of gold is just a bar of gold," he said in a telephone interview last week. "It doesn't do anything. There's a market for it, sure, just as there is for, say, a work of fine art, and if you buy and sell at the right price, you'll make a profit. But if there's no cash flow, no dividend, no earnings, how do you calculate its intrinsic worth?" Answer: "You can't. It's not that kind of an asset."
In the 1980s and '90s, Mr. Brinson did path-breaking research on the effects of asset allocation on portfolios. In two papers in the Financial Analysts Journal, he and several colleagues found that broad decisions about asset classes -- which to hold and in which proportions -- accounted for more than 90 percent of a portfolio's performance.
He concluded that eight asset classes -- none of them gold or any other commodity -- were all that an investor needed. For a model "moderate risk" portfolio under normal market conditions, he said in the interview, those eight and their allocations are: stocks from developed markets, 49 percent; emerging-market stocks, 6 percent; investment-grade bonds from developed markets, 25 percent; emerging-market bonds, 2 percent; high-yield bonds, 3 percent; commercial real estate, 10 percent; and private equity and venture capital combined, 5 percent.
All but the private equity and venture capital portions can be bought through low-cost index mutual funds or E.T.F.'s.
Is there any use for gold and other commodities in a diversified portfolio? There might be, he said, if you view them as a form of insurance against a specific risk and if the price is reasonable. Gold might be seen as a hedge against inflation, he said -- although it has underperformed since 1980. It might also be viewed as a hedge against a decline in the value of the dollar, but at gold's current level, he said, "you're paying a very high price" for it.
Mr. Kinniry of Vanguard pointed out that stocks and gold had both been negatively correlated with the dollar -- meaning they have tended to rise when the dollar has fallen. But since 1985, the negative correlation of stocks has been greater, and stocks have also provided a greater return. In short, an allocation to international stocks would have hedged better against a dollar decline, with much lower volatility.
ONE argument for putting up with the volatility of commodities like gold is that their long-term price trend is upward. That's the case made by Joe Wickwire, who manages the Fidelity Global Commodity Stock fund and the Fidelity Select Gold Portfolio.
"Commodities and gold, from an asset-class standpoint, are in secular bull markets" because of the growth of resource-intensive emerging-market economies, he said. (Mr. Wickwire also said that over the long haul, exposure to commodities was worthwhile for portfolio diversification, regardless of price trends.)
Of course, it's much easier to discern trends after the fact, and on that score the picture for gold isn't entirely attractive. It peaked in price in 1980 at $850 a troy ounce. Factor in inflation, and that comes to more than $2,400. After more than 30 years, in other words, an investor in gold would still be operating at a loss, without even counting the cost of storing and protecting the gold.
It's a beautiful metal, certainly. Is it worth holding? Maybe, but don't bet your life on it.

Abstract: Not surprisingly, a large number of the students showed no significant progress on tests of critical thinking, complex reasoning and writing that were administered when they began college and then again at the ends of their sophomore and senior years. Even at those colleges where for the past several decades tuition has far outpaced the rate of inflation, students are taught by fewer full-time tenured faculty members while being looked after by a greatly expanded number of counselors who serve an array of social and personal needs.

Full text: COMMENCEMENT is a special time on college campuses: an occasion for students, families, faculty and administrators to come together to celebrate a job well done. And perhaps there is reason to be pleased. In recent surveys of college seniors, more than 90 percent report gaining subject-specific knowledge and developing the ability to think critically and analytically. Almost 9 out of 10 report that overall, they were satisfied with their collegiate experiences.
We would be happy to join in the celebrations if it weren't for our recent research, which raises doubts about the quality of undergraduate learning in the United States. Over four years, we followed the progress of several thousand students in more than two dozen diverse four-year colleges and universities. We found that large numbers of the students were making their way through college with minimal exposure to rigorous coursework, only a modest investment of effort and little or no meaningful improvement in skills like writing and reasoning.
In a typical semester, for instance, 32 percent of the students did not take a single course with more than 40 pages of reading per week, and 50 percent did not take any course requiring more than 20 pages of writing over the semester. The average student spent only about 12 to 13 hours per week studying -- about half the time a full-time college student in 1960 spent studying, according to the labor economists Philip S. Babcock and Mindy S. Marks.
Not surprisingly, a large number of the students showed no significant progress on tests of critical thinking, complex reasoning and writing that were administered when they began college and then again at the ends of their sophomore and senior years. If the test that we used, the Collegiate Learning Assessment, were scaled on a traditional 0-to-100 point range, 45 percent of the students would not have demonstrated gains of even one point over the first two years of college, and 36 percent would not have shown such gains over four years of college.
Why is the overall quality of undergraduate learning so poor?
While some colleges are starved for resources, for many others it's not for lack of money. Even at those colleges where for the past several decades tuition has far outpaced the rate of inflation, students are taught by fewer full-time tenured faculty members while being looked after by a greatly expanded number of counselors who serve an array of social and personal needs. At the same time, many schools are investing in deluxe dormitory rooms, elaborate student centers and expensive gyms. Simply put: academic investments are a lower priority.
The situation reflects a larger cultural change in the relationship between students and colleges. The authority of educators has diminished, and students are increasingly thought of, by themselves and their colleges, as "clients" or "consumers." When 18-year-olds are emboldened to see themselves in this manner, many look for ways to attain an educational credential effortlessly and comfortably. And they are catered to accordingly. The customer is always right.
Federal legislation has facilitated this shift. The funds from Pell Grants and subsidized loans, by being assigned to students to spend on academic institutions they have chosen rather than being packaged as institutional grants for colleges to dispense, have empowered students -- for good but also for ill. And expanded privacy protections have created obstacles for colleges in providing information on student performance to parents, undercutting a traditional check on student lassitude.
Fortunately, there are some relatively simple, practical steps that colleges and universities could take to address the problem. Too many institutions, for instance, rely primarily on student course evaluations to assess teaching. This creates perverse incentives for professors to demand little and give out good grades. (Indeed, the 36 percent of students in our study who reported spending five or fewer hours per week studying alone still had an average G.P.A. of 3.16.) On those commendable occasions when professors and academic departments do maintain rigor, they risk declines in student enrollments. And since resources are typically distributed based on enrollments, rigorous classes are likely to be canceled and rigorous programs shrunk. Distributing resources and rewards based on student learning instead of student satisfaction would help stop this race to the bottom.
Others involved in education can help, too. College trustees, instead of worrying primarily about institutional rankings and fiscal concerns, could hold administrators accountable for assessing and improving learning. Alumni as well as parents and students on college tours could ignore institutional facades and focus on educational substance. And the Department of Education could make available nationally representative longitudinal data on undergraduate learning outcomes for research purposes, as it has been doing for decades for primary and secondary education.
Most of all, we hope that during this commencement season, our faculty colleagues will pause to consider the state of undergraduate learning and our collective responsibility to increase academic rigor on our campuses.

Full text: HEADING for the highway this summer? The great American road trip will cost you more than last year thanks to high fuel prices.
The price of gas on average in the United States was $3.96 earlier this month, up from $2.91 a gallon last summer, according to AAA's Daily Fuel Gauge Report. And prices have been topping $4 at some service stations in California, Connecticut, Illinois and New York.
But don't tell the kids it's going to be another staycation summer just yet. While the price of gas in the United States is still more than a dollar higher than the same time last year, analysts say gas prices may have hit their peak and are expected to drop, offering drivers some relief. In the meantime, there are plenty of ways to keep your fuel bill in check, from choosing the right destination (see our 50 round-trip getaways you can take on one tank of gas at nytimes.com/travel) to downloading the right app. Below, 13 tips for cutting the cost of that summer road trip.
GET A GAS APP There are dozens of apps that help users find cheap gas while on the road. GasBuddy.com, offers one of the more comprehensive for iPhone and Android users, with a clean design and estimated drive times to gas stations in your vicinity. Just tap "Find Gas Near Me" or search by city or ZIP code for a list of gas stations sorted by price. You can click Midgrade, Premium or Diesel for those prices. Selecting Map View displays the stations on a map. Another option is AAA's free TripTik Mobile app for the iPhone, which allows users to search prices for their preferred grade of gasoline.
LET THE HOTEL COVER THE GAS To avoid a repeat of 2008, when the soaring price of gas made "staycation" a household term, destinations that rely primarily on drivers are rolling out gas-related incentives. San Luis Obispo, a coastal resort town halfway between San Francisco and Los Angeles, is promoting car-free vacations with 20 percent Amtrak discounts and hotel bargains of up to 30 percent off. And many hotel chains, from Sky Hotels & Resorts in Orlando to Personality Hotels in San Francisco, are offering gas cards or rebates from $10 to $50, depending on the package and length of stay.
STAY OUT OF TRAFFIC Google Maps, which comes preinstalled on many smartphones or is available for download, offers an at-a-glance display of road conditions in major cities to help you find the best route around congestion so you don't burn up extra fuel in stop-and-go traffic. Color-coded lines correspond to the intensity of traffic: green for no traffic jams, yellow for medium congestion, red for heavy congestion, and red-and-black for stop-and-go. Google Maps Navigation, offered through Google Maps for Android, has recently been updated to offer alternate routes to avoid tie-ups.
PAY LESS FOR YOUR RENTAL CAR A cheaper rental will help offset the cost of gas. Check out the booking site Autoslash.com, which searches the Web for discount coupons on car rentals and applies them after you book. It then continually checks for lower rates and coupons up until your trip date, and automatically applies any discounts it finds. Willing to gamble? Consider Web sites like Priceline.com and Hotwire.com, which offer deep discounts to travelers willing to be locked into a preset price before learning what company they'll be renting from.
RESHUFFLE YOUR CREDIT CARDS Consider a credit card that offers cash back for gas purchases. Discover's Open Road card, for example, offers 2 percent back on the first $250 in combined gas and restaurant purchases each billing period, and Capital One's No Hassle Cash Rewards card offers 2 percent cash back on purchases at gas stations and major grocery stores.
LOSE THE GOLF CLUBS An extra 100 pounds in your vehicle could reduce your mileage by up to 2 percent, according to an Energy Department and Environmental Protection Agency Web site, Fueleconomy.gov. And keep luggage inside the vehicle rather than strapped to the roof, to reduce aerodynamic drag.
FILL IT UP WITH REGULAR Most vehicles that call for premium fuel (which was $4.23 on average earlier this month, according to AAA's Daily Fuel Gauge Report, up from $3.20 a year ago) can run on regular just fine, according to Cars.com, an online car shopping site. "Technically, this makes the car less efficient, but not to a degree that negates the cost savings from the cheaper fuel grade," states the site under Tips for Saving Fuel. However, some cars do require premium fuel, so before you fill up, check your owner's manual to find out if the higher-priced gas is required or just recommended.
USE THE RIGHT OIL You can boost your gas mileage by 1 or 2 percent by using the manufacturer's recommended grade of motor oil, according to Fueleconomy.gov. Look for oil that says "energy conserving" or "resource conserving" on the A.P.I. performance symbol to be sure it contains friction-reducing additives that form films to reduce the friction of moving engine parts and to help improve fuel economy.
SKIP THE TOLL-BOOTH LINE On road trips in the Northeast, a monthly E-ZPass subscription will keep you out of long lines, saving you idling time and gas. The electronic toll-collection system is offered on most toll roads, bridges and tunnels across 14 states from Maine to Virginia and west to Illinois. SunPass is the equivalent in Florida; FasTrak is in the San Francisco Bay Area.
CHECK YOUR TIRE PRESSURE You can improve your gas mileage by up to 3.3 percent by simply keeping your tires inflated to the proper pressure, according to Fueleconomy.gov. Underinflated tires can lower gas mileage by 0.3 percent for every pound-per-square-inch drop in pressure of all four tires. (You can get a tire-pressure gauge at any hardware store or auto store for about $10.) Check your vehicle's owner's manual or the door jamb for the proper level of inflation (not the tire itself, which shows the maximum tire inflation pressure), and be sure to check the tire pressure when the tires are cold, as internal pressure increases when the car has been on the road for a while and the tires heat up.
SLOW DOWN Gas mileage typically decreases at speeds above 60 miles per hour, according to Fueleconomy.gov. "You can assume that each 5 m.p.h. you drive over 60 m.p.h. is like paying an additional $0.24 per gallon for gas," the site states.
TAKE THE BUS Cheap express buses with names like BoltBus, Megabus and Vamoose have become popular along the Northeast Corridor and elsewhere, with amenities like free Wi-Fi and power and seats for $30 or less, depending on when you reserve -- which can be less than what you might pay in gas if you drive yourself. Search for seats at GotoBus.com or at BusJunction.com.
USE PEDAL POWER You don't need four wheels to get a taste of the open road. Two will do just fine. The nonprofit Adventure Cycling Association offers tools to help cyclists plan, including more than 40,000 miles of cycling routes throughout North America, with elevation profiles, turn-by-turn directions and symbols that mark bike shops, lodging and other services. Twenty-two long-distance routes, which are broken into shorter sections of about 350 miles long, are available for $14.75 each or $11.75 for those who pay a $40 membership fee.

Abstract: While Medicare savings under the Democrats' health care law and pending proposals would come mainly from reduced federal payments to doctors, hospitals and insurance companies, the budget put forth by House Republicans would cut spending by turning Medicare into a system of vouchers for future beneficiaries to buy private insurance, but in amounts that would not keep pace with the projected inflation of health costs.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, officially informed Congress on Monday that the government, as projected, had reached its $14.3 trillion debt limit and had begun taking what he has called "extraordinary measures" to meet obligations while lawmakers and President Obama seek a budget deal to raise the limit.
Mr. Geithner, in a letter to Congressional leaders of both parties, stood by an earlier projection that even with the Treasury's accounting maneuvers, on Aug. 2 "the borrowing authority of the United States will be exhausted," ultimately threatening a government default.
With the House in recess all week, few members of Congress were even in town, and budget talks between Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Congressional leaders were suspended. But a bipartisan "Gang of Six" continued negotiating toward a long-term debt-reduction compromise in what could be their make-or-break week.
The focus of budget attention was in Mr. Obama's hometown, Chicago, where Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin defended the House Republican budget he wrote, and its Medicare proposals in particular, in a speech to the Chicago Economic Club.
As dozens of protesters marched and chanted outside, Mr. Ryan told his business audience, "Our budget proposal makes no changes for those in or near retirement, and offers future generations a strengthened Medicare program they can count on, with guaranteed coverage options, less help for the wealthy and more help for the poor and the sick."
The speech by Mr. Ryan, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, was part of a Republican effort to counter intensifying criticism from Democrats, who hope to exploit the Medicare controversy to take back seats in 2012. That would be payback, as Democrats see it, since they lost their House majority in midterm elections last November after Republicans campaigned against Medicare reductions in Mr. Obama's health care law.
The message on one of the protest signs -- "Hands Off Medicare" -- was also seen last year at conservatives' protests against Democrats. Yet despite that sentiment, which is also reflected in national polls, Republican and Democratic leaders agree that Medicare and Medicaid must be squeezed for savings because rising health care prices and an aging population make those programs the main drivers of the projected and unsustainable growth of the nation's debt. But their approaches are far apart.
The House Democratic leader, Representative Nancy Pelosi, was in New York on Monday, along with the two Democratic leadership lieutenants she named to the Biden budget talks, to meet with financial industry and news outlets about the debt. She told Bloomberg Television that "we are open to many" suggestions for Medicare savings, adding, "We cannot take that off the table."
"But one suggestion we are not open to is the abolishment of Medicare," she said. "That is what the Republicans have put forth in their budget."
While Medicare savings under the Democrats' health care law and pending proposals would come mainly from reduced federal payments to doctors, hospitals and insurance companies, the budget put forth by House Republicans would cut spending by turning Medicare into a system of vouchers for future beneficiaries to buy private insurance, but in amounts that would not keep pace with the projected inflation of health costs.
The Congressional Budget Office has said the Ryan plan would drive up health care costs for older Americans in the future and limit their coverage. But Mr. Ryan framed his proposal as a way to slow the growth in Medicare spending while giving older Americans more control over their care choices.
His plan would "give seniors the power to deny business to inefficient providers" while Democrats would "give government the power to deny care to seniors," Mr. Ryan said.
Republicans have acknowledged that the two parties will not be able to agree on Medicare and other entitlement programs -- a "big, grand, global bargain" on debt reduction, as Mr. Ryan put it -- before the August deadline for increasing the debt limit.
Given that, the goal in the budget talks is twofold: to find up to $2 trillion in specific multiyear savings from other programs, including farm subsidies, and to agree on mechanisms in the budget process to force the two parties to find more savings in the future, including in Medicare and other entitlement programs.
"For every dollar the president wants to raise the debt ceiling, we can show him plenty of ways to cut far more than a dollar of spending," Mr. Ryan said, echoing the position of Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio.
Democrats demand that higher revenues also must be part of the equation, particularly from the wealthiest Americans. Ms. Pelosi signaled one concession: while she repeated Democrats' demand to end the Bush-era tax cuts after 2012 for the richest households, she said she would support making repeal apply to those with taxable income above $1 million instead of $250,000.
Mr. Ryan opposed any tax increases and accused Democrats of "class warfare" for pitting Americans of different incomes against one another. "Class warfare may be clever politics, but it is terrible economics," Mr. Ryan said.
He said he would decide this week whether to seek the Senate seat in Wisconsin that Herb Kohl, a Democrat, is giving up. Mr. Ryan said he wanted to retain an influential role in the fiscal debate, which would seem to weigh in favor of his staying in the House.

Full text: LONDON -- Could the long dollar slide be over?
For the better part of the past decade, and particularly in the last few months, the American dollar has been the 98-pound weakling of the foreign exchange world. It has lost value against almost every other global currency -- not just the euro, pound and yen but even the Romanian new leu and the Latvian lats.
Driven largely by the Federal Reserve's policy of printing dollars to help spur a healthy economic recovery that remains stubbornly elusive, the dollar, weighed against a basket of other currencies, hit a 40-year low this month.
But betting against the dollar may no longer be such a safe play -- not necessarily because of any sudden macroeconomic shifts but because of a sense that the long dollar sell-off may have finally gone too far.
Since May 4, the dollar is up 4 percent against the euro and 2 percent against the pound, while rallying against the Romanian and Latvian currencies as well.
The dollar's bounce, though too brief to be called a trend, has not been driven by any noticeable improvement in America's economic fundamentals. Indeed, the faint but real risk that Congress will fail to reach agreement on raising the legal ceiling on government borrowing only underscores the still parlous state of the American economy.
At the same time, unemployment in the United States remains stubbornly high, at 9 percent. And there is a strong belief among big money investors that the Obama administration as well as the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, tacitly welcome a cheaper dollar to spur exports and encourage American manufacturers to hire more aggressively.
"The U.S. economy is still facing headwinds -- from weak housing to reductions in government spending," said Ray Attrill, a currency strategist for BNP Paribas in New York. "For those reasons, we think the export sector is where policy makers are looking for growth."
But analysts also see another, more technical reason behind the dollar's long decline -- one that may well be ending. Ever since the global financial crisis began to ease in 2009, the appeal of investing in higher-yielding currencies and commodities all over the world has created what, in trader parlance, is called a risk-on, risk-off dynamic.
Investors tend to sell their safer holdings, like United States Treasury bonds, when they feel more bullish. Because 90 percent of the world's hedge funds are dollar-based, those changes in sentiment can have a depressing effect on the American currency. Reserve-rich central banks in emerging markets have also been selling dollars and buying euros to rebalance their reserve portfolios, said Mr. Attrill, citing recent data from the International Monetary Fund.
"Everything has been strengthening against the dollar -- this is something that has not happened in the past," said Stephen L. Jen, an independent currency strategist and former economist for the International Monetary Fund.
But that momentum now appears to have swung too far to one side -- particularly as Europe's own debt problems return to the limelight. Mr. Jen sees the euro's rise to a high of $1.49 from $1.19 over the last year as overdone, especially in light of the festering problems in Greece and other weak euro zone economies. Even now, the euro is back down to $1.42.
"With its sovereign debt issue and the growth differential in the euro zone," Mr. Jen said, the euro is "just too expensive."
Other analysts also have begun to say enough already.
In part, that is because much of the dollar's recent weakness was driven by the perception that the European Central Bank, and to a lesser extent the Bank of England, were more likely to raise interest rates to keep inflation under control than was the Federal Reserve, which remains committed to keeping short-term interest rates near zero. With rates likely to be higher in Europe than in the United States, traders moved their money out of United States government bills and bonds to gain greater returns abroad.
But the stronger the euro got, the more likely it became that its rise would begin to bite back. As the euro rose to nearly $1.50, the strength of the currency started to raise doubts about whether the mighty German export machine, which gained competitive strength when the euro was weaker, could continue to perform so successfully around the world.
Meanwhile, with growth negligible or nonexistent in Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain, and with each of them facing huge challenges paying their debts, Europe's position looks more precarious -- especially if the European Central Bank remains determined to push interest rates higher this year.
"The beleaguered European periphery is now choking on a caustic concoction of a surging euro exchange rate, a deflating E.C.B. balance sheet and rising short-term funding rates," Michael T. Darda, chief economist of MKM Partners, wrote in a recent note to clients.
"If there is no path to a reasonable recovery in nominal G.D.P. for the European periphery, fiscal austerity will fail and serial defaults and/or restructurings likely will follow," he wrote.
Just as puzzling to some has been the robust performance of the British pound over the past year -- up 11 percent against the dollar.
On the surface, the raw economic numbers in Britain are as bad as anywhere in Europe: a deficit of 10 percent of gross domestic product, a weak banking sector and sluggish economic growth that continues to be revised downward.
As Paul De Grauwe, a Brussels-based economist noted recently, Britain's 10-year bond yields are 2 percent below those of Spain, despite Spain's having lower debt and deficit figures.
But Britain has the benefit of running its own monetary policy. And its status apart from the United States dollar and outside the euro zone has attracted foreign bond investors seeking a haven.
To British officials, such a trend reflects its ambitious program to cut government spending and bring down the deficit. But a recent report on the British economy by Morgan Stanley strikes a more skeptical tone, highlighting six problem areas that could cause investors to take flight.
Morgan Stanley cites the effect on growth that public sector cuts will have, the continued vulnerability of the country's banks to a weakening real estate market and increased tensions between the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats in the coalition government.
The upshot is that "the pound could be in for a pounding," the analysts conclude.
Predicting a currency's direction is about as inexact as sciences come, especially in today's volatile markets. But one thing seems certain: the dollar may no longer be king, but after a long slump it can still flex its muscles from time to time.

Abstract: Over all, the economy, though still slowly mending, has largely been able to shrug off the effects of high gas prices. Since the beginning of the year, employers have added more than 750,000 jobs, which puts more money into the economy in the form of additional paychecks.\n

Full text: High gasoline prices have not derailed the economic recovery, but that's small comfort to Loraine Greene. A customer relations manager in the Hudson Valley of New York, Ms. Greene spent the weekend packing up to move to a rental house much closer to work.
At $4 a gallon, gas is too expensive to justify the 50-mile round-trip commute.
"The option was either to sell my truck and get something smaller, or to try to get closer to work," said Ms. Greene. She chose to move. The new house is just eight miles from the office.
Economists say steady job growth over the last three months, as well as this year's federal payroll tax cut, have offset the downward pull of rising energy costs on the economy as a whole. But like a lot of economic news these days, what looks good on paper does not feel good for Americans still digging their way out of the recent recession.
At a True Value hardware store in Wilmington, Del., customers stressed by the cost of filling their tanks are buying more replacement parts for wheelbarrows and lawn mowers instead of buying new equipment.
In the San Francisco Bay area, the daily number of cars driving across the Golden Gate Bridge has dropped while passengers on the buses and ferries have risen.
"If all your customers are paying $50 for a tank of gas that they used to pay $25 for, somebody is not getting that $25," said William Dunkelberg, chief economist for the National Federation of Independent Business.
According to a recent survey, one in four small businesses cited weak sales as their No. 1 problem.
Although gas prices have eased slightly in recent weeks, they are, on average, up about 30 percent over a year earlier. High oil prices have also driven up prices of food, airfares and even taxi rides in some regions, diverting consumers from other purchases.
The nation's largest retailer, Wal-Mart, which reported earnings on Tuesday, said high gas prices had restrained its shoppers, and its business. Sales at stores open at least a year fell by 1.1 percent in the first quarter, as visits to stores in the United States declined.
"Our customers are consolidating trips due to higher gas prices," said Bill Simon, who oversees the United States business. It was the eighth consecutive decline in same-store sales at Wal-Mart.
Lowe's, the home improvement chain, which reported a 5.7 percent slide in quarterly profits on Monday, said its traffic was down 3.4 percent in the quarter as customers made fewer trips.
"Rising gas and energy prices are cited by homeowners as the top factor affecting future spending plans, followed by the state of the overall economy and inflation in general," said Lowe's chief executive, Robert A. Niblock, explaining earnings that missed analysts' expectations in a conference call with investors.
MasterCard Advisors' SpendingPulse, which researches consumer spending, reported on Tuesday that the gallons of gas pumped nationwide in the last month fell by 1 percent from the period a year ago.
Conserving miles has become a new business priority at Topical BioMedics, where Ms. Greene works in Rhinebeck, N.Y. Her boss, Lou Paradise, recently invested in cloud computing so employees could access documents and programs and work from home more. He hands out gas cards as bonuses and birthday gifts, and holds seminars on how to make a car more energy-efficient. And when employees have to drive somewhere on business, he urges them to use the company cars -- a Volkswagen TDI, a clean-diesel car and a Ford Transit Connect van, which is relatively fuel-efficient.
Other companies are also trying to help workers cope with high gas prices. Robert Trow, who runs a small distribution company in Mashpee, Mass., recently gave his employees a raise -- on top of the one he gave in December -- to help them deal with pump prices.
At the hair products business Paul Mitchell, which is based in the Los Angeles area, the company gives employees 20 cents a mile when they carpool, and covers bus fare in full. More employees are taking the company up on the offers now. Even the chief financial officer, Rick Battaglini, has begun carpooling to work.
Over all, the economy, though still slowly mending, has largely been able to shrug off the effects of high gas prices. Since the beginning of the year, employers have added more than 750,000 jobs, which puts more money into the economy in the form of additional paychecks.
And while the rise in gas prices since the beginning of the year roughly translates into a loss of $75 billion to $100 billion in spending power if sustained for the entire year, the payroll tax cuts adds back about $112 billion, according to an analysis by Credit Suisse.
"It looks like those two things have fought each other to a standstill," said Neal Soss, chief economist at Credit Suisse.
Some have benefited from the higher gas prices. Online sales boomed in April as shoppers stayed home on weekends, clicking a mouse instead of driving a car. E-commerce sales grew 19.2 percent in April compared with a year earlier, the biggest increase since July 2007, according to SpendingPulse.
Car sales have also risen recently as consumers choose smaller cars. In April, vehicle sales rose 18 percent, as shoppers turned toward compact and fuel-efficient models like the Chevrolet Cruze, Ford Fiesta and Focus models, and even electric cars like the Nissan Leaf.
Tom Veasey, owner of the True Value in Wilmington, said that customers had been grumbling to cashiers about the high cost of driving, and those who might previously have traveled five miles to a Home Depot were now shopping in his store. But total sales were still flat, he said, as an increasing number of customers replaced parts rather than bought new gear.
"A new wheelbarrow is $59.95" and they can get a new tire for $20, Mr. Veasey said. "When things are going good they will just buy something new and save themselves the time it takes to repair something."
Airlines and hotel companies say that improvements in the broader economy are helping them continue to sell tickets and rooms. A Gallup poll released on Monday showed that more than six in 10 Americans planned to take a vacation away from home this summer, although they expected to pay more for transportation costs than last year.
Henry Harteveldt, travel industry analyst at Forrester Research, said he had detected a deceleration in advance reservations. "The booking path has been slowing down," he said. "We're now getting into the heavy intense period for summer vacation planning and there is concern among hotel operators that because gas prices are higher whether the customer is flying or driving, there will be less discretionary budget to spend" on things like restaurants, entertainment and other businesses that rely on travelers. For now, analysts expect oil prices to level off rather than shoot higher. But if the recent softening reverses and gas prices go higher, economists suspect that more consumers will react.
"There is some point where people may get a little more panicky about it rather than simply adjusting to it," Mr. Soss said.

Full text: For Wal-Mart's customers, the economy still looks a lot like 2009.
The poorer customers who shop at the nation's biggest retailers are still on tight budgets. They wait inside the store at the end of each month with full shopping carts until the clock strikes midnight. Then, their electronic-benefit transfers from the government go through, and they pay for their groceries and other staples. They buy items in small packages, which cost less than big ones.
And while they are spending more on food at Wal-Mart than they did a year ago, they are buying less in most other categories.
Same-store sales, or sales at stores open at least a year, fell by 1.1 percent in the quarter in the United States, the company said on Tuesday. It was the eight quarterly drop in a row, one of the worst streaks in Wal-Mart's history.
Over all, however, earnings beat analyst expectations, helped by sales strength in international stores and at its Sam's Club unit. The company said its quarterly profit was $3.4 billion, or 97 cents a share, up from $3.3 billion, or 87 cents a share, a year earlier. Wal-Mart had forecast a profit of 91 to 96 cents a share for the quarter, and analysts expected a 95-cent-a-share profit on average.
Sales in the period, which ended April 30 and was the first quarter of Wal-Mart's fiscal year, rose 4.4 percent, to $103.4 billion.
Low prices on groceries during an inflationary period helped sales, Wal-Mart executives said. Same-store sales in grocery were up in the single digits for the quarter in the United States. Wal-Mart said food prices rose about 1 percent in the quarter as a result of inflation.
Yet Wal-Mart had some trouble getting shoppers into the rest of the store.
In apparel, for instance. "We're simply not converting enough of our grocery customers to shop apparel," said William S. Simon, the president and chief executive of Wal-Mart's United States division, in a conference call with investors.
After flirting with fashion-forward items, Wal-Mart decided to focus on basic clothes, but company executives said they did not perform well.
"It's something that we've stumbled with over the last several quarters and we're not happy with," Charles M. Holley Jr., the chief financial officer, said in a conference call with reporters. "It does start with basics, and for us to be able to sell anything that's fashionable at all, we really have to get basics down first."
While "we had a fairly good quarter" with items like T-shirts and underwear, he said, "where we're still not executing is in the kids' and the women's business."
In other departments, Wal-Mart is piling merchandise in its aisles to signal value, and is stocking items in smaller packages that someone on a budget can afford, in an effort to take market share from dollar stores.
"You see customers that are running out of money at the end of the month going to the smaller pack sizes -- they are not necessarily a better value," Mr. Holley said, but "we have been continuing to work on that, so we have the smaller pack sizes."
Wal-Mart said this strategy had been successful with products like air fresheners and fishing products, so far. "These modular changes focused on bringing back assortment, ensuring opening price points were available in all categories, and increased the holding power on the shelf," Mr. Simon said.
Same-store sales were all in negative territory in categories like entertainment, including electronics; hard lines, which are items like hardware and crafts; apparel; and home.
In the United States, Wal-Mart has been making a number of changes to revive same-store sales. Michael T. Duke, chief executive of Wal-Mart, said on Tuesday that "comp sales growth remains the greatest priority for me and the entire Wal-Mart U.S. team."
Wal-Mart said it would continue with its expansion plans in the United States, particularly with smaller stores. Its grocery-only stores, which are called Neighborhood Markets and are about one-third the size of a typical Wal-Mart, performed well in the quarter. There, same-store sales were up 4 percent as visits by customers rose. Wal-Mart said that because of those results, it would open another 30 to 40 Neighborhood Markets this year.
The company will also open 15 to 20 Wal-Mart Express stores by the end of the year in urban and rural areas. At about 15,000 square feet, they will sell groceries "along with key general merchandise categories," Mr. Simon said. They will also function as a depot of sorts for Walmart.com's items. Customers can order something from the extended online inventory, and pick it up at the store.
Analysts noted that drops in Wal-Mart's same-store sales were at least easing.
"Top-line results came in somewhat ahead of expectations, reflecting a more moderate decline in U.S. comps," Colin McGranahan, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, wrote in a note to clients.
Wal-Mart said it expected same-store sales to range from down 1 percent to up 1 percent in its second quarter.
Separately, Home Depot also reported earnings on Tuesday. Although its profit beat Wall Street expectations, its same-store sales in the United States declined because of the harsh winter, Craig A. Menear, its merchandising chief, said in a call with investors.
Home Depot's revenue was $16.82 billion, down from $16.86 billion in the same period a year earlier. But because of aggressive cost-cutting, its net income was up 12 percent to $812 million, or 50 cents a share, versus analyst expectations of 49 cents a share.
"It's all weather," Home Depot's chief financial officer, Carol B. Tome, said in an interview. "It's not an assortment issue. It's just when it's cold and snowing and raining, people aren't going to do the outdoor products."
Shares of Wal-Mart fell 52 cents, or about 1 percent, to $55.54 a share. Shares of Home Depot rose 1.14 percent, or 42 cents, to $37.40.

For States, A Glimmer Of Hope On Deficits

Abstract: Much of the increase in California tax collections came not because of especially robust job or wage growth -- wages grew at less than 1 percent last year, officials said -- but rather because much of the income growth and capital gains in the state were concentrated among California's highest earners, who pay the highest tax rates.

Full text: From stronger-than-expected tax collections in deficit-ridden California to projected surpluses in struggling states like Michigan and Pennsylvania, a growing number of recession-weary states are finally announcing a bit of good budget news for the first time since the downturn began.
But it would probably be premature to pop the Champagne, or even the prosecco -- or to otherwise declare the fiscal crisis that has hammered states to be over.
"If the question is 'Are we out of the woods?,' I think the answer is probably no," said Donald J. Boyd, a senior fellow at the Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of Government in Albany, which closely tracks state tax collections. "We're closer to the edge. But there are still so many things that states and localities need to worry about."
Tax collections, which had their steepest and longest decline on record at the beginning of the recession, have been steadily rising for more than a year, but states still collected nearly 10 percent less in taxes last year than they did before the downturn began, the institute found, adjusting for inflation. The end of the federal stimulus program is also leaving states struggling to balance their budgets without the more than $150 billion in federal aid that they have used for this purpose over the last three years. And many rainy day funds have been spent.
So what to make of the better-than-expected tax collections?
In some states, they are as much a sign that the expectations were too low as they are a sign of vibrant economic growth. At the beginning of the recession, many states were much too optimistic when it came to predicting tax collections -- forcing them to pass painful midyear spending cuts and tax increases when things grew worse than many economists had forecast.
So it was perhaps prudent to err on the side of caution with overly conservative estimates this year. There is certainly no political downside: governors like to be able to announce that they have been able to whittle away the daunting budget gaps that were predicted earlier in their terms.
Now, as states tally their tax collections for the all-important month of April, states including California, Michigan, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Texas are reporting that tax collections appear to be better than they had feared. As welcome as the news is, though, tax collections can be highly volatile, and there is still plenty of reason for caution.
California officials warned against being overly optimistic when they reported this week that the state was on track to collect $6.6 billion more this year and next year than it had projected. The unexpected windfall will allow the state to avert some of the draconian education cuts that had been proposed. But officials cautioned that the good news may not last.
Much of the increase in California tax collections came not because of especially robust job or wage growth -- wages grew at less than 1 percent last year, officials said -- but rather because much of the income growth and capital gains in the state were concentrated among California's highest earners, who pay the highest tax rates.
"While this is to be expected, given the stock market recovery and the good earnings of California's top performing companies," the state warned in its revenue report, "such recovery rates of growth are not likely to be sustained."
In some states, the better-than-expected tax collections are complicating the efforts by governors to muscle through politically difficult spending cuts.
When Pennsylvania announced earlier this month that it had collected $506 million more in taxes this year than it had predicted it would, some state lawmakers began to question whether they still needed to go ahead with a proposal by the state's new Republican governor, Tom Corbett, to make deep cuts to education -- especially higher education. But even if the state ends the current fiscal year with a surplus of half a billion dollars, Pennsylvania officials are still projecting a gap of more than $4 billion in the year that begins July 1.
A similar dynamic is playing out in Michigan. When the state announced that it would probably take in $429 million more than expected this year, some lawmakers suggested that they might not have to make all the deep cuts that Michigan's governor, Rick Snyder, has proposed for the state's schools and local governments.
But administration officials note that Michigan's fiscal challenges remain severe -- estimating that the rainy day fund in their battered state coffers would keep the government running for only around a half an hour -- and say that using money that may not recur to balance next year's budget would make it harder to put the state in a strong position over the long term.
"Decisions to build the 2012 budget with any 2011 surplus would jeopardize that strong position, and only serve to delay needed decisions by another year," John Nixon, the state's budget director, said in a statement. "We must resist the urge to kick the can down the road once again."
Michigan is under additional fiscal pressure: a series of business tax cuts supported by Mr. Snyder, a Republican, could cost the state an estimated $1 billion in lost revenues next year, revenue the state plans to recoup from a series of other tax changes, including taxes to pensions.
When states began to work on next year's budgets, 44 of them faced deficits of roughly $112 billion, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Elizabeth McNichol, a senior fellow at the center who specializes in state fiscal issues, said that the improving revenue picture came after many states made tough cuts and raised tax rates, and that most states did not expect to collect taxes at pre-recession levels for several years.
"What's happening is, we've kind of hit bottom," Ms. McNichol said. "But we have a long way to go before things get back to normal."

Abstract: The minutes, closely watched for any signs of change in Federal Reserve monetary policy, were released as the central bank was nearing the close of its program to buy $600 billion in Treasury securities by the end of June -- its main effort to pump money into the economy as a stimulus.

Full text: A majority of Federal Reserve policy makers said at their most recent meeting that the best next step in their program to stimulate the economy would be to reduce the balance sheet and then focus on interest rates, according to minutes of the April meeting released on Wednesday. But they also said that simply discussing interest rates and other options did not mean that any move "would necessarily begin soon."
The minutes, closely watched for any signs of change in Federal Reserve monetary policy, were released as the central bank was nearing the close of its program to buy $600 billion in Treasury securities by the end of June -- its main effort to pump money into the economy as a stimulus.
Economists and the financial markets will be parsing the language of the central bank and its officials in the coming weeks for signs of what the central bank might do when that program ends.
The minutes made clear that the Fed committee had made no decision on its next move but was debating its options. They said that the committee was continuing to reinvest principal payments from securities holdings and that it would finish its program, announced late last year, of buying the Treasury securities. The bank will also maintain the federal funds rate of zero to one-quarter percent.
The minutes said there were no dissents among the 10 policy makers involved in the decision.
Still, the range of views presented in the April minutes emphasized the debate that is taking place as the bank nears the end of its stimulus program, also known as quantitative easing. This debate will only become sharper over the next month; the committee meets again June 21-22.
Most of the policy makers favored raising the federal funds rate before selling securities, giving the central bank the option to adjust it if needed should there be weaker economic growth. A "few" participants preferred that sales and increases in the rate should take place at the same time, and a few preferred that sales begin before any increases. The minutes also said that almost all the members of the committee believed that reinvestments from securities should be stopped as the first step. Most said the timing of asset sales should be announced, with several members saying they could vary with the economic outlook.
"Most participants saw changes in the target for the federal funds rate as the preferred active tool for tightening monetary policy when appropriate," the minutes said.
Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist at the research firm MFR, said the minutes put a "finer focus" on the Fed's strategy for exiting the program.
"That was in the minutes for the first time in terms of nuts and bolts," he said. "It was the first time that we really got something down on paper that seems to be a road map in terms of what they are talking about."
Gregory Daco, a senior economist with IHS Global Insight, said he believed that the committee would let the bank balance sheets shrink toward the end of 2011, and start moving rates back up in early 2012.
There seemed to be overall agreement on what steps were needed, but not the sequence, in the minutes. "They have studied the options," Mr. Daco said. "Agreeing on a strategy not to reinvest payments of principal on securities would reduce the balance sheet. That would be in itself a first tightening of monetary policy."
Stock prices on Wall Street rose after the release of the minutes.
The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, held a news conference immediately after the April meeting, the first such event by any Fed chairman.
Mr. Bernanke, speaking last month, had said that there would be no changes in short-term rates for several meetings. The committee meets eight times each year.
Energy and food prices rose in the first quarter, the minutes noted, with a small uptick in core price inflation, and the government's official unemployment rate, which reflects the share of the labor force actively seeking jobs, rose to 9 percent in April from 8.8 percent in March.
The committee projected that the unemployment rate would decline gradually, while revising up their inflation projections, even though they said higher inflation would be "transitory."
Over all, conditions pointed to a "moderate economic recovery," despite unexpectedly slowing growth in the first quarter.

Abstract: An analysis by The New York Times of Labor Department data about college graduates aged 25 to 34 found that the number of these workers employed in food service, restaurants and bars had risen 17 percent in 2009 from 2008, though the sample size was small. "The less schooling you had, the more likely you were to get thrown out of the labor market altogether," said Mr. Sum, noting that unemployment rates for high school graduates and dropouts are always much higher than those for college graduates.

Full text: The individual stories are familiar. The chemistry major tending bar. The classics major answering phones. The Italian studies major sweeping aisles at Wal-Mart.
Now evidence is emerging that the damage wrought by the sour economy is more widespread than just a few careers led astray or postponed. Even for college graduates -- the people who were most protected from the slings and arrows of recession -- the outlook is rather bleak.
Employment rates for new college graduates have fallen sharply in the last two years, as have starting salaries for those who can find work. What's more, only half of the jobs landed by these new graduates even require a college degree, reviving debates about whether higher education is "worth it" after all.
"I have friends with the same degree as me, from a worse school, but because of who they knew or when they happened to graduate, they're in much better jobs," said Kyle Bishop, 23, a 2009 graduate of the University of Pittsburgh who has spent the last two years waiting tables, delivering beer, working at a bookstore and entering data. "It's more about luck than anything else."
The median starting salary for students graduating from four-year colleges in 2009 and 2010 was $27,000, down from $30,000 for those who entered the work force in 2006 to 2008, according to a study released on Wednesday by the John J. Heldrich Center for Workforce Development at Rutgers University. That is a decline of 10 percent, even before taking inflation into account.
Of course, these are the lucky ones -- the graduates who found a job. Among the members of the class of 2010, just 56 percent had held at least one job by this spring, when the survey was conducted. That compares with 90 percent of graduates from the classes of 2006 and 2007. (Some have gone for further education or opted out of the labor force, while many are still pounding the pavement.)
Even these figures understate the damage done to these workers' careers. Many have taken jobs that do not make use of their skills; about only half of recent college graduates said that their first job required a college degree.
The choice of major is quite important. Certain majors had better luck finding a job that required a college degree, according to an analysis by Andrew M. Sum, an economist at Northeastern University, of 2009 Labor Department data for college graduates under 25.
Young graduates who majored in education and teaching or engineering were most likely to find a job requiring a college degree, while area studies majors -- those who majored in Latin American studies, for example -- and humanities majors were least likely to do so. Among all recent education graduates, 71.1 percent were in jobs that required a college degree; of all area studies majors, the share was 44.7 percent.
An analysis by The New York Times of Labor Department data about college graduates aged 25 to 34 found that the number of these workers employed in food service, restaurants and bars had risen 17 percent in 2009 from 2008, though the sample size was small. There were similar or bigger employment increases at gas stations and fuel dealers, food and alcohol stores, and taxi and limousine services.
This may be a waste of a college degree, but it also displaces the less-educated workers who would normally take these jobs.
"The less schooling you had, the more likely you were to get thrown out of the labor market altogether," said Mr. Sum, noting that unemployment rates for high school graduates and dropouts are always much higher than those for college graduates. "There is complete displacement all the way down."
Meanwhile, college graduates are having trouble paying off student loan debt, which is at a median of $20,000 for graduates of classes 2006 to 2010.
Mr. Bishop, the Pittsburgh graduate, said he is "terrified" of the effects his starter jobs might have on his ultimate career, which he hopes to be in publishing or writing. "It looks bad to have all these short-term jobs on your resume, but you do have to pay the bills," he said, adding that right now his student loan debt was over $70,000.
Many graduates will probably take on more student debt. More than 60 percent of those who graduated in the last five years say they will need more formal education to be successful.
"I knew there weren't going to be many job prospects for me until I got my Ph.D.," said Travis Patterson, 23, a 2010 graduate of California State University, Fullerton. He is working as an administrative assistant for a property management company and studying psychology in graduate school. While it may not have anything to do with his degree, "it helps pay my rent and tuition, and that's what matters."
Going back to school does offer the possibility of joining the labor force when the economy is better. Unemployment rates are also generally lower for people with advanced schooling.
Those who do not go back to school may be on a lower-paying trajectory for years. They start at a lower salary, and they may begin their careers with employers that pay less on average or have less room for growth.
"Their salary history follows them wherever they go," said Carl Van Horn, a labor economist at Rutgers. "It's like a parrot on your shoulder, traveling with you everywhere, constantly telling you 'No, you can't make that much money.' "
And while young people who have weathered a tough job market may shy from risks during their careers, the best way to nullify an unlucky graduation date is to change jobs when you can, says Till von Wachter, an economist at Columbia.
"If you don't move within five years of graduating, for some reason you get stuck where you are. That's just an empirical finding," Mr. von Wachter said. "By your late 20s, you're often married, and have a family and have a house. You stop the active pattern of moving jobs."

Abstract: The shift is causing ripples of class tension, posing a nettlesome problem in a society in which more women are entering the work force without the sort of elaborate system of day care that exists in some industrialized nations. A growing number are refusing to sleep over or are leaving the field, choosing jobs that allow more time for a private life, according to parents, nannies and directors of nanny placement agencies.

Full text: SAO PAULO, Brazil -- In a decade working as a nanny, Andreia Soares finally clambered up the ladder into Brazil's middle class.
With the money she saved, she bought a two-bedroom apartment with granite kitchen countertops and a small veranda, a house for her mother, a plot of land for her brother and a Louis Vuitton purse from Paris that she proudly pulls from a closet.
Later this year, with her monthly salary of $3,100, which she earns caring for a 10-month-old girl in an upscale neighborhood, she plans to buy a $39,000 car -- in cash.
"I have always had this dream of buying a house and a car," said Ms. Soares, 39. "Today that dream is closer than ever for nannies."
While she has done better than many of her counterparts, Ms. Soares is part of a nanny revolution that is shattering the colonial stereotype of inexpensive but dedicated domestic help in Latin America.
As their expectations for a better quality of life rise, nannies are increasingly seeking to work for the very wealthy and becoming less affordable for many middle-class families. The shift is causing ripples of class tension, posing a nettlesome problem in a society in which more women are entering the work force without the sort of elaborate system of day care that exists in some industrialized nations.
Fading fast are the days when white-frocked nannies worked for a menial salary, with only two days off every 15 days. Better-qualified nannies are refusing to work weekends and are demanding salaries that are two to four times what they were paid just five years ago. A growing number are refusing to sleep over or are leaving the field, choosing jobs that allow more time for a private life, according to parents, nannies and directors of nanny placement agencies.
The income of domestic employees in Brazil, including nannies and maids, rose 34 percent from 2003 to 2009 -- more than twice the average increase for all of Brazil's active workers -- said Marcelo Neri, an economist at the Getulio Vargas Foundation. At the same time, he said, the working hours of domestic employees fell by 5 percent to 36.2 hours a week.
"Today, what I need from a nanny job is different than before," said Ieda Barreto, 32. Seven years ago, she was making about $400 a month and had only 24 hours off every Thursday, making it tough to hold onto a boyfriend. Today she expects to make almost $1,900 working Monday to Friday, and she charges an additional $250 to work weekends.
"I am looking for quality of life," Ms. Barreto said. "I value myself much more than I did before."
The rising expectations reflect the growth of Brazil's middle class, which rose to nearly 55 percent of the population in 2010 from 37 percent in 2003, Dr. Neri said.
Today, "Brazil is becoming like the United States," where hourly paid housekeepers are more common than sleep-over nannies, said Jacqueline Szwarc, a psychologist who was picking up her children outside a private school in Sao Paulo. "The salaries have gotten very high, and the search for domestic help has become very difficult."
The supply of nannies has thinned as some have sought other work in the expanding job market, driving up salaries for those who stay in the field, economists, nannies and nanny agency directors said. Many remaining nannies are taking courses to become better qualified and to help them find work in wealthier homes, where they can charge much more.
While some mothers embrace the changes as good for Brazil's development, many are up in arms. Once isolated, nannies now trade information about the market and working conditions through e-mail, blogs and social networks.
"It's a mafia," said Ms. Szwarc, 44, adding that she has been lucky to hold onto the same nanny for 10 years.
Six years ago, Evanice dos Santos, a former nanny turned blogger, had no Internet access and caught up with fellow nannies at a Sao Paulo athletic club where her employers were members. Now married, she has dedicated herself to helping nanny friends online "find a better path" toward more money and better hours.
Some well-paid nannies in Sao Paulo are employing nannies of their own. Ms. Soares said nanny friends earning more than $4,300 a month were paying less-qualified nannies a little over $900 a month to baby-sit for their own children.
Like a growing number of parents, Rafaella Toledo brought in her nanny from Paraguay, and parents said nannies from Peru were also arriving in Sao Paulo. "The situation is terrible," Ms. Toledo said. "Now that I am pregnant I am going to look for someone that isn't a nanny, because nannies think they are on another level now."
Michelle Tchernobilsky, 29, has changed nannies about 10 times in the past year, searching for someone affordable yet qualified enough to care for her 10-month-old son. Cutting the nanny from her budget is not an option for Ms. Tchernobilsky, a public relations manager, but neither is paying a salary that she considers exorbitant. "We are hostages," she said.
Marilia Toledo, the owner of the Masa nanny agency, said the market in Sao Paulo, South America's largest city, had become a "war" between demanding nannies and parents trying to hold back nanny inflation. "Things are changing too quickly and abruptly," said Ms. Toledo, who has owned the agency for 20 years. "No one was prepared for this."
Among the top requests she receives, she says, is for a nanny who has never worked in Sao Paulo because they are "more humble."
Ms. Toledo and some economists are skeptical about how long the revolution can last. Dr. Neri said Brazilians still had low education levels: an average of seven years of study for adults older than 25. Rodrigo Constantino, an economist at Graphus Capital, said a lack of investment in education in Brazil would prevent many domestic workers from finding other, better-paying work, and incessant salary demands could stoke inflation.
"Brazil is riding this wave, and each class is moving up the ladder," Mr. Constantino said. "The problem I see is how this is going to be sustainable."
Still, nannies like Ms. Soares are investing in themselves. It began nine years ago when she took a nursing course. She followed up two years later with specialized nanny courses at a so-called baby-sitting center. Next year she plans to take English lessons.
"People in our field are starting to get more qualifications and they are looking for families with more money to pay them," Ms. Soares said. "Because of that, a lot of women are losing their nannies."
After a two-year stint working as a nanny in New York, she found her way last year to the home of Fernanda Parodi, a lawyer married to a chief executive in Sao Paulo. Ms. Parodi says she has no complaints about Ms. Soares's salary, though she is counseling her to buy a cheaper car.
"I don't ever want her to leave," said Ms. Parodi, 38, who is considering promoting her to personal assistant.
Where some mothers see a debilitating revolution, she sees social progress. "If Brazil wants to move beyond a third-world country, then it needs to allow everyone to participate in the growth," Ms. Parodi said. "It's the price you pay for progress."

Full text: Sears Holdings, the department store chain, swung to a first-quarter loss as shoppers cut back on spending.
The net loss was $170 million, or $1.58 a share, Sears said in a statement Thursday. That compared with a $16 million profit a year earlier.
Separately, Gap, the apparel chain, cut its full-year profit forecast by one-fourth as costs rose faster than expected.
Sales at Sears sank about 3 percent to $9.7 billion. Sears faces increasing competition from other department stores and discount chains. Target, which reported first-quarter results on Wednesday, said shoppers were staying cautious about spending.
"Our first quarter was adversely impacted by unfavorable weather, economic pressures facing our customers, and comparisons to last year's government-sponsored stimulus program relating to the purchase of appliances," Louis J. D'Ambrosio, Sears's chief executive, said in the statement. "However, we also fell short on executing with excellence."
Shares of Sears fell $1.99, or 2.6 percent, to $73.86.
Sears brought in Mr. D'Ambrosio in February after a three-year search for a chief. He told shareholders at the company's annual meeting this month that Sears would expand services and technology to increase sales and understand customers better. The company also hired a new head of apparel, long a struggling unit, earlier this year.
Sales at stores open at least a year fell 5.2 percent at domestic Sears stores and 1.6 percent at its Kmart chain last quarter, with appliance, clothing and consumer electronics sales driving the decline.
Gap, meanwhile, said its fiscal 2011 profit would be $1.40 to $1.50 a share. Gap had previously forecast a maximum of $1.93 a share.
Expenses per unit will rise 20 percent in the second half, outweighing price increases, Gap said. The apparel industry is facing cost inflation for the first time in two decades because of surging cotton prices and increased pay for workers who make clothes in China and other parts of Asia. Retailers have said they plan to raise prices to counter the higher costs.
First-quarter net income fell 23 percent to $233 million, or 40 cents a share, in the period ended April 30, from $302 million, or 45 cents, a year earlier. Analysts projected 39 cents, the average of 28 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
Same-store sales fell 3 percent in the first quarter at the chain's Gap brand.
Gap has closed underperforming stores and shrunk other locations in the United States. The retailer is now looking overseas for sales growth by expanding into new regions in the past year, including China and Italy.

Full text: DETROIT -- The average price for a new car in the United States is edging toward $30,000, as automakers remain stingy with discounts and there just are not enough of the most popular vehicles available.
Though the average price remains below historic highs when adjusted for inflation, nominally it has never been so high, according to the auto-research site TrueCar.com. That concerns some car company executives, who fear that the industry's recent comeback could be stalled if buyers start experiencing sticker shock.
And early sales data for this month are not encouraging: Retail sales of new vehicles are projected to total about 850,000 in May, according to J. D. Power & Associates. That translates to an annual seasonally adjusted selling rate of about 9.6 million units, a significant drop-off from the 10.7 million rate achieved from January through April. The data exclude sales to rental car and other fleets.
"You've got to figure out that sweet spot where you offer just enough incentives to get people to buy your cars without sacrificing profitability," said Jesse Toprak, vice president of industry trends at TrueCar.
Several factors account for the rising prices. Because there are more new models on the market than in recent years, automakers need fewer incentives to lure consumers into the showrooms. The earthquake in Japan has also caused shortages of some cars and crossover vehicles built there by Toyota, Honda and Nissan, which has driven the prices up on the limited inventory in stock.
Car companies are also commanding better prices for their small cars because of added features like entertainment systems and heated seats. Consumers are increasingly paying more to get upscale options on smaller cars that were once primarily bare-bones purchases.
"On a dollar basis, they're paying more, but they're getting a whole lot more car than in the past," said Mr. Toprak.
The average transaction price for a new vehicle in the United States, including rebates and other incentives, reached $29,602 in April, according to TrueCar.com. That figure represented an increase of $324 over March. But automakers are not necessarily getting greedy, industry analysts said. Some of the increases are going toward covering higher material costs, and the companies are also taking advantage of strong demand.
General Motors, for example, is running short on supply of its Chevrolet Cruze compact car, and the Ford Motor Company is low on inventories of its Focus sedan and Explorer S.U.V. Some of the biggest year-over-year price increases are found on revamped, hot-selling models like Chrysler's Jeep Grand Cherokee and Honda's Odyssey minivan.
"The pricing is more of a symptom of lack of supply than anything else," said Jim Farley, Ford's head of global sales marketing. "But it is affecting the industry's volumes."
Ford and Toyota announced across-the-board price increases this year on their 2011 models. Ford said it would raise prices by an average of $117, or 0.4 percent, while Toyota said it would lift prices by about 1.7 percent on many of its Toyota, Lexus and Scion models. G.M. has said it will charge more for many of its vehicles, by an average of $123.
But the increases are only part of the equation. Overall discounts and sales incentives fell to their lowest levels in five years in April, according to the automotive site Edmunds.com.
Incentives averaged about $2,320 per vehicle in April, a $370 reduction from the period a year earlier. Some of the reduction is attributed to sales programs that expired and were not renewed. Japanese carmakers have also pulled back incentives because of the earthquake-related shortages, and the American companies have followed suit.
"Our incentive strategy is based on the competitive environment," said Mr. Farley. "There's been a drastic change because stocks have been depleted and we're launching a lot of new products that don't require incentives to sell."
Automakers always try to balance the need for incentives against consumers' demand. But if companies pull back too far on discounts, some potential shoppers will simply wait until the next deals are announced.
The American automakers are not as reliant on heavy incentives as in years past, mostly because the companies closed dozens of factories to bring their production in better balance with their market shares.
They also have little reason to pile on discounts when their Japanese competitors have cut incentives so drastically.
"Putting incentives on cars you don't have doesn't make sense," said Neale A. Kuperman, president of Rockland Toyota in Blauvelt, N.Y.
Mr. Kuperman said he usually sold up to 20 Prius gas-electric hybrid cars each month, but so far in May has only sold six. His overall dealership sales volumes are down about 50 percent because of inventory shortages.
There are no discounts available on many models because of supply constraints, he said.
"As much as everybody likes to think that we set the prices, the market dictates it," said Mr. Kuperman. "When there's less of a supply, the prices tend to go up. When there's more, the prices go down."
J. D. Powers's executive director of forecasting, Jeff Schuster, said the lower sales so far in May could be attributed partly to higher transaction prices, as well as rising fuel costs and inventory shortages.
With fleet sales included, the annual selling rate for May so far is about 11.9 million vehicles, compared with a 13.2 million rate for the previous four months combined.
Even with the sales drop, Mr. Schuster said that vehicle prices, without incentives, had risen about 1.6 percent in May from April.
"It makes for better margins for the automakers, but on potentially lower volumes," he said.

Full text: IN January, conventional wisdom said that three long-term trends were likely to persist in 2011: the dollar would continue to fall, commodities would keep roaring and foreign stocks would outpace domestic ones.
Two of these predictions have gone awry since early May, as the dollar has surged 5 percent against the euro while commodity prices have sunk by more than 19 percent. These developments may also lessen the appeal of foreign stocks, some market strategists say, worsening the odds for the third prediction, too.
So far this year, shares of companies in developed markets overseas have risen 3 percent, less than half the gain of the Standard & Poor's 500 index.
Emerging markets, meanwhile, have had a worse start to the year. Shares of companies in fast-growing economies like India and Brazil have lost value while returns for Chinese stocks have been relatively flat.
Chalk it up to a couple of factors, strategists say. First, China has been stepping on the fiscal brakes, aiming to prevent asset bubbles in its red-hot economy. And central banks throughout the emerging markets -- including India and Brazil -- have begun to raise interest rates in an effort to slow inflation.
These moves help to account for the recent pullback in commodity prices. Crude oil, for example, is down 13 percent from its peak three weeks ago.
But while lower commodity prices may reduce some inflationary pressure in an economy, they often lead to selling in commodity-related sectors of the market, said Alec Young, international equity strategist at S.& P.
International stocks generally have higher correlations with commodities markets than do domestic equities. While energy and materials companies make up less than 16 percent of the S.& P. 500 index of domestic stocks, those two categories account for 27 percent of emerging-market stocks.
"For a long time, that was a good thing for the emerging markets," Mr. Young added. "But right now commodities seem increasingly volatile," and that could create a headwind for those markets' shares.
Mark D. Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott, said companies in commodity-producing countries like Russia and Brazil could struggle, not just because of uncertainty in raw material prices, but also because so much of their growth is tied to serving China's needs. "If China has a hiccup" stemming from its efforts to slow the economy, he said, "it's going to cause a blowback to all those emerging-market countries."
Not everyone thinks these stocks are at such risk. James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, says the emerging markets have underperformed domestic shares since last fall, when central banks in developing nations began to tighten monetary policies by lifting interest rates.
"But I think they're just about done doing that," he said. And many other risks in emerging markets, he added, have already been priced into the market.
On the other hand, Mr. Paulsen said he expected the dollar to at least stabilize as investors realized that the United States economy was likely to accelerate while economies of other large industrialized nations would probably keep slowing.
Europe, with its debt-related problems, is growing at roughly half the pace of the United States while Japan's economy has been disrupted by the recent earthquake and tsunami. If the dollar strengthens, Mr. Paulsen said, American investors will lose an advantage they have enjoyed in foreign stocks: price appreciation based on a weakening dollar.
ALL of this could make investing in Europe and Japan less appealing. And more uncertainty could also refocus investor attention on valuation, another fundamental factor.
While there is a growing sense that stocks in general are becoming expensive, strategists agree that one market area is still relatively cheap: large, blue-chip companies with little debt and with stable, though unspectacular, earnings growth. This group of so-called high-quality companies would include names like Microsoft and Coca-Cola.
What's more, the bigger these high-quality stocks are, the cheaper they seem to be, said Ben Inker, head of asset allocation at the asset manager GMO.
Yet for reasons Mr. Inker said he didn't quite understand, "the domestic market has far more than its share of these types of stocks than foreign markets do."
That's just one more reason that foreign investing could be a whole lot harder this year.

Abstract: Higher American interest rates make both foreigners and Americans want to buy more American bonds and fewer foreign bonds. [...] the demand for dollars increases and the supply decreases.

Full text: AT a recent news conference, Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, was asked about the falling dollar. He parried the question, saying that the Treasury secretary was the government's spokesman on the exchange rate -- and, of course, that the United States favors a strong dollar.
Listening to that statement, I flashed back to one of my first experiences as an adviser to Barack Obama. In November 2008, I was sharing a cab in Chicago with Larry Summers, the former Treasury secretary and a fellow economic adviser to the president-elect. To help prepare me for the interviews and the hearings to come, Larry graciously asked me questions and critiqued my answers.
When he asked about the exchange rate for the dollar, I began: "The exchange rate is a price much like any other price, and is determined by market forces."
"Wrong!" Larry boomed. "The exchange rate is the purview of the Treasury. The United States is in favor of a strong dollar."
For the record, my initial answer was much more reasonable. Our exchange rate is just a price -- the price of the dollar in terms of other currencies. It is not controlled by anyone. And a high price for the dollar, which is what we mean by a strong dollar, is not always desirable.
Some countries, like China, essentially fix the price of their currency. But since the early 1970s, the United States has let the dollar's value move in response to changes in the supply and demand of dollars in the foreign exchange market. The Treasury no more determines the price of the dollar than the Department of Energy determines the price of gasoline. Both departments have a small reserve that they can use to combat market instability, but neither has the resources or the mandate to hold the relevant price away from its market equilibrium value for very long.
In practice, all that "the exchange rate is the purview of the Treasury" means is that no official other the Treasury secretary is supposed to talk about it (and even he isn't supposed to say very much). That strikes me as a shame. Perhaps if government officials could talk about the exchange rate forthrightly, there would be more understanding of the issues and more rational policy discussions.
Such discussions would start with some basic economics. The desire to trade with other countries or invest in them is what gives rise to the market for foreign exchange. You need euros to travel in Spain or to buy a German government bond, so you need a way to exchange currencies.
The supply of dollars to the foreign exchange market comes from Americans who want to buy goods, services or assets from abroad. The demand for dollars comes from foreigners who want to buy from the United States.
Anything that increases the demand for dollars or reduces the supply drives up the dollar's price. Anything that lowers the demand for dollars or raises the supply causes the dollar to weaken.
Consider two examples. Suppose American entrepreneurs create many products that foreigners want to buy, and start many companies they want to invest in. That will increase the demand for dollars and so cause the dollar's price to rise. Such innovation will also make Americans want to buy more goods and assets in the United States -- and fewer abroad. The supply of dollars to the foreign exchange market will fall, further strengthening the dollar. This example describes very well the conditions of the late 1990s -- when the dollar was indeed strong.
Now suppose the United States runs a large budget deficit that causes domestic interest rates to rise. Higher American interest rates make both foreigners and Americans want to buy more American bonds and fewer foreign bonds. Thus the demand for dollars increases and the supply decreases. The price of the dollar will again rise.
This example describes conditions in the early 1980s, when President Ronald Reagan's tax cuts and military buildup led to large deficits. Those deficits, along with the anti-inflationary policies of the Fed, where Paul A. Volcker was then the chairman, led to high American interest rates. The dollar was very strong in this period.
Both developments -- brilliant American innovation and troublesome American budget deficits -- caused the dollar to strengthen. Yet one is clearly a positive for the American economy, the other a negative. The point is that there is no universal good or bad direction for the dollar to move. The desirability of any shift in the exchange rate depends on why the dollar is moving.
It also depends on the state of the economy. At full employment, a strong dollar is good for standards of living. A high price for the dollar means that our currency buys a lot in foreign countries.
But in a depressed economy, it isn't so clear that a strong dollar is desirable. A weaker dollar means that our goods are cheaper relative to foreign goods. That stimulates our exports and reduces our imports. Higher net exports raise domestic production and employment. Foreign goods are more expensive, but more Americans are working. Given the desperate need for jobs, on net we are almost surely better off with a weaker dollar for a while.
Fed policy is determined by inflation and unemployment in the United States. But if Mr. Bernanke could discuss the exchange rate openly, he would probably tell you that one way any monetary expansion helps a distressed economy is by weakening the dollar. That is taught in every introductory economics course, yet the Fed is asked to pretend it isn't true.
Likewise, fiscal policy is determined by domestic considerations. But trimming our budget deficit, as we should over the coming years, would also weaken the dollar. And that, in turn, would blunt the negative impact of deficit reduction on employment and output in the short run.
STRANGELY, every politician seems to understand that it would be desirable for the dollar to weaken against one particular currency: the Chinese renminbi. For years, China has deliberately accumulated United States Treasury bonds to keep the dollar's value high in renminbi terms. The United States would export more and grow faster if China allowed the dollar's price to fall. Congress routinely threatens retaliation if China doesn't take steps that amount to weakening the dollar.
But in the very next breath, the same members of Congress shout about the importance of a strong dollar. If a decline in its value relative to the renminbi would be beneficial, a fall relative to the currency of many countries would help even more in the current situation.
To say this openly risks being branded not just an extremist but possibly un-American. Perhaps it is time for a more adult conversation. The exchange rate is the purview of market economics, not of the Treasury or strong-dollar ideologues.

Abstract: According to FiBL, land for organic use rose to 1.94 percent of all agricultural land in Europe in 2009, from 1.74 percent in 2008 and 1.25 percent in 2003. According to the Agriculture Department, certified American organic farmland grew 127 percent from 2002 to 2007 and then by 12 percent from 2007 to 2009.

Full text: PARIS -- Even during a period of rising food prices and economic uncertainty, Damien Bignon, a poultry farmer in the Paris region, cannot meet the demand from local markets and stores for his organic eggs.
At the Ferme des Beurreries near Feucherolles, west of the capital, Mr. Bignon employs five people overseeing 3,000 chickens on 432 acres. He also produces organic cereals for his own feed and other clients and wheat to sell to a neighboring mill.
Mr. Bignon thinks he could comfortably expand to 12,000, matching the number of chickens on the farm in 1990 before its conversion to organic operations. But he is determined to manage carefully any growth to maintain quality, keep customers satisfied and not crowd out other local farmers. He charges 2 euros ($2.82) for a half dozen eggs -- about twice the cost of factory-farmed eggs at a French supermarket.
"The issue for us is retaining that success without falling into the traps of industrialized agriculture," he said. "There's risks in organic becoming a mass market."
Sales of organic foods appear robust across Europe and the United States despite weak economic conditions and rising inflation. The strong sales are attracting more interest and activity from investors, who see potential in mergers through economies of scale, especially in Europe's more fragmented market.
In December, Compagnie Biodiversite, the French owner of Lea Nature, which supplies organic food, health products, textiles and cosmetics through large retail channels, announced its purchase of a large stake in Ekibio, another French player. That alliance makes it France's second-biggest organic food specialist, behind Distriborg, which is owned by the Dutch group Royal Wessanen.
Wessanen, which has been divesting assets in North America, is trying to expand in Europe, analysts say.
In Britain, Abel & Cole, which operates a home delivery service for organic products and has been owned by a private equity firm since 2007, is seen by analysts as an acquisition target, perhaps for a supermarket chain.
And Hain Celestial, based in Melville, N.Y., which makes organic food, drinks and personal care products, this year bought Danival, a French organic producer, as well as GG UniqueFiber, a Norwegian natural foods company. The investor Carl C. Icahn has been building a stake in Hain.
Many farmers and analysts expect the sector to remain strong in coming years, helped by increased public awareness of environmental and potential health benefits, better organization and production techniques, new demand from emerging markets and those periodic public scares attending events like the recent nuclear plant radiation leaks in Japan.
Another theory is that, as with the luxury industry, the core consumers, typically with high disposable incomes, are less affected by hard times.
"Over all, it's very surprising how stable the organic markets have been even in this critical economic situation," said Urs Niggli, director of FiBL, an independent nonprofit research institute focusing on organic agriculture in Switzerland. He predicted sales would accelerate in coming years, assuming economic growth picked up.
Organic Monitor, a market research firm and consultancy based in London, estimates that the global market for organic food and drink products in 2009 was $55 billion, 5 percent more than in 2008 and more than double the level in 2000. Significantly, the financial crisis and recession slowed the rate of growth in some countries, while the trend continued.
In the United States, sales of organic food reached $26.7 billion last year, according to the Organic Trade Association. That was a 7.7 percent increase from 2009, which itself was 5.1 percent higher than 2008. The United States has now overtaken Europe to become the largest market.
European sales grew 3.9 percent in 2009 after double-digit growth in previous years, according to Organic Monitor. In France, a late starter, and in Sweden and Belgium, sales in 2009 expanded more than 15 percent, according to FiBL. British sales contracted in the face of weaker consumer spending and fewer product lines at large stores, while the German market, Europe's largest, was stable after a period of strong increases.
Logically, the amount of land set aside for organic farming is also increasing. According to FiBL, land for organic use rose to 1.94 percent of all agricultural land in Europe in 2009, from 1.74 percent in 2008 and 1.25 percent in 2003.
According to the Agriculture Department, certified American organic farmland grew 127 percent from 2002 to 2007 and then by 12 percent from 2007 to 2009.
While both Europe and the United States have helped organic farmers, the methods and motivations have been different.
Europeans nurtured the sector because of perceived environmental and social benefits, while the United States supported standards, certification, research and education, treating the sector "primarily as an expanding market opportunity," according to paper written several years ago by Carolyn Dimitri and Lydia Oberholtzer, experts at the Agriculture Department.
In Europe, subsidies for organic farming are drawn from European Union funds and disbursed to farmers by national governments, as well as in less direct ways, like marketing and procurement programs.
Organic farms receive on average higher subsidies in absolute terms and per hectare (almost 2.5 acres) than conventional farms, according to the Europe's Farm Accountancy Data Network. In Western Europe generally, the subsidy amounted to 438 euros ($614) a hectare against 355 euros in 2007.
Yet Christian Eichert, managing director in the German state of Baden-Wurttemberg for Bioland, that country's largest organic farmers' association, said Europe lacked a coherent policy toward the sector. Some countries like Spain and Italy focus on exports, while German support is state-driven and often hostage to local political changes, he said.
Recently, there have been some signs that austerity pressures across Europe are eating into state support.
The French government announced at the start of this year that it was halving a tax break for small farmers converting land to organic production. In Germany last year, the state of Schleswig-Holstein sought to remove organic subsidies but backed down after public pressure.
There is a "general uncertainty" surrounding future support, Mr. Eichert said. And forthcoming changes to the Europe's Common Agricultural Policy after 2013 have led farmers to expect more cuts.

Full text: YIYANG, China -- It is a power struggle that is causing a power shortage -- one that has begun to slow China's mighty economic growth engine.
Balking at the high price of coal that fuels much of China's electricity grid, the nation's state-owned utility companies are defying government economic planners by deliberately reducing the amount of electricity they produce.
The power companies say they face financial ruin if the government continues to tightly limit the prices they can charge customers, even as strong demand is sending coal prices to record levels. The chairwoman of one giant utility, China Power International, recently warned that one-fifth of China's 436 coal-fired power plants could face bankruptcy if the utilities cannot raise rates.
The utilities' go-slow tactics include curtailing the planned expansion and construction of power plants, and running plants for fewer hours a day. And in a notable act of passive defiance, the power companies have scheduled an unusually large number of plants to close for maintenance this summer -- right when air-conditioning season will reach its peak.
So far there have been no public confrontations between Beijing officials and utility executives. But the dispute indicates that China's unique marriage of market competition and government oversight may be starting to fray after three decades of phenomenal economic success.
"The Chinese electricity companies are firing a shot across the bow, and essentially saying they're not going to just sit there and take massive losses," said Jeremy C. Carl, a Stanford University researcher on Chinese energy issues. "It's almost the equivalent of a corporate sick-out."
The official Xinhua news agency reported late Monday that the country's main electricity distribution company, the State Grid, had warned that power shortages this year could be worse than in 2004, when China had its worst blackouts in decades. That year, the problem involved railroad bottlenecks in getting coal to power plants -- an issue largely resolved with the subsequent investments in more rail lines.
This time, the impasse between government and industry is not the only cause of China's electricity shortages. Surging electricity demand is also a factor.
China's 700 million rural residents have been on a two-year buying spree of electric devices, purchasing hundreds of millions of air-conditioners and other energy-hungry appliances with government subsidies aimed at narrowing the gap in living standards between cities and rural areas.
In a little-noticed milestone, the latest data from Beijing and Washington shows that China passed the United States last year as the world's largest consumer of electricity.
Since March, responding to the power shortages, government officials in six provinces have begun rationing electricity, including here in Hunan province. At least five more provinces are preparing to do so, according to official reports.
In Yiyang, a town of 360,000 in south-central China, electricity shortages are so severe this spring that many homes and businesses receive power only one day in three. Even gasoline stations in this region are silent more days than not, because the pumps lack electricity.
Meanwhile, blackouts are starting to slow the nation's torrid growth of energy-intensive industries like steel, cement and chemicals. Unlike garment makers and other small manufacturers, the big factories cannot easily switch to backyard diesel generators.
To accommodate businesses that do use diesel back-ups, China last week banned exports of diesel fuel to conserve scarce supplies.
The power cuts are a reason the year-on-year growth rate of China's industrial production dipped last month -- to 13.4 percent in April, down from 14.8 percent in March -- and seems to be continuing to fall.
The lower productivity of factories, plus high diesel costs for those using generators, is likely to further raise average prices of American imports from China. Prices of Chinese exports are already up 2.8 percent in the last 12 months, after years of gradual decline that helped restrain inflation in the United States.
As power-deprived factories in China have less demand for raw materials, the impact has rippled around the world among China's suppliers as well, contributing to 10 percent declines in global prices for commodities like iron ore and copper. That is impinging on the economies of countries like Australia and Brazil, for which China is a big customer of natural resources.
Looking ahead, China has placed big bets on wind turbines for generating electricity. And despite Japan's recent nuclear travails, China is also cautiously proceeding with plans to lead the world in the construction of nuclear power plants in the coming decade.
But coal is still king in China. The country has nearly half of the world's total coal-fired capacity, and coal plants currently represent 73 percent of this nation's total generating capacity.
Hydroelectric power, at 22 percent, is a distant second and has been hampered by droughts this year.
If Beijing and the utilities can resolve their differences, China plans to build even more coal-powered plants. Doing so would produce another big surge in emissions of greenhouse gases, of which China is already the world's largest emitter.
"Only coal can provide new capacity in the time and scale needed," said David Fridley, a China energy expert at the University of California, Berkeley.
The idea of recalcitrant utilities balking at Beijing's dictates might seem to contradict the popular perception of China's government-guided economy. But while the electric utilities are majority-owned by the government, they are also profit-motivated companies accountable to the other holders of their publicly traded stock. So the power companies' incentives are not necessarily aligned with those of central planners in Beijing.
The government, for its part, has imposed an array of price controls, including on electricity rates, as it struggles to insulate the Chinese public from inflation. Consumer prices are rising 5.3 percent a year according to official figures, and Chinese and Western economists say the true rate may be nearly double that.
But coal prices, which the government deregulated in 2008, are rising even faster in China, which is a net importer of coal despite having its own extensive mining operations.
Huaneng, China's biggest electric utility, said last month that electricity rates it charges customers should have been 13 percent higher last year to match the increase in coal prices. But regulators held utility rates essentially flat.
Spot coal prices in China have surged an additional 20 percent this year -- to a record $125 a metric ton for top grades -- partly because of floods in Australia's and Indonesia's coal fields and partly because Japan is buying more from the global market to offset its lower nuclear power output.
But Chinese regulators have let electricity prices climb only 2.5 percent this spring. Residential users in China's cities pay 8.2 cents a kilowatt-hour. That compares to a national average of 11 cents in the United States and 15 cents in the heavily urban mid-Atlantic region. Chinese industrial users in cities are supposed to pay 12 cents a kilowatt-hour, although politically connected businesses receive discounts; the average industrial rate in the United States is 7 cents, and 9 cents in the mid-Atlantic region.
Big power generators like Huaneng buy nearly half their coal on the spot market and the rest on long-term contracts with prices that rise more slowly.
The government has put pressure on China's coal mines, also largely state-owned, to continue supplying power companies with coal at below-market prices under long-term contracts. But the mines, which are also profit-oriented operations, have responded with their own form of passive resistance -- by sending their cheapest, lowest-quality coal with the most polluting sulfur.
As a result, many power plants are now paying penalties to yet another arm of the government -- environmental regulators -- for burning the sulfur-spewing coal. That has further added to the utilities' cost of doing business, said Howard Au, the chief executive of Petrocom Energy, a Hong Kong company that builds coal-blending facilities.
Trying to help utilities reduce those environmentally and financially costly emissions, Petrocom has built a series of gray silos and red conveyor belts at Lianyungang port in northern China to dilute high-sulfur Chinese coal with low-sulfur imported coal.
Blackouts appear to be the worst in smaller towns like Yiyang here in Hunan, one of China's largest and most populous provinces. The power shortages are threatening to curb the explosive growth the province has experienced since the opening in late 2009 of a high-speed electric train link to prosperous Guangdong province to the south, which helped companies tap Hunan's cheaper land and labor force.
In rationing electricity, Hunan officials have given priority to big cities like Changsha, the provincial capital. Even there, though, industrial districts are blacked out one day in three.
In Yiyang, meanwhile, multiday blackouts have ruined a tiny restaurant run by Xu Zhanyun, 48, who now must cook meals over lumps of coal instead of his electric stove. "I have so much food in my refrigerators that all went bad," he said.
There is running water only every other day because the pumping station requires electricity. And so he must haul water from a well -- as he did as a boy, before China's economy surged.
In other cities, factories require employees to work at odd hours when electricity is available.
"They shut down the electricity for a day every three days," said Jin Jianping, manager of an umbrella factory in Ningbo, in east-central China. "We just arrange night shifts for everyone."

Full text: WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- Unexpectedly weak consumer spending hobbled the nation's economy in the first quarter and fresh signs of a slowdown in the labor market pointed to a continuing struggle for the recovery.
The economy grew at an annual 1.8 percent rate in the first three months of this year, the Commerce Department said on Thursday, unchanged from an earlier estimate and weaker than most forecasts.
A separate report from the Labor Department showed the number of Americans claiming unemployment benefits unexpectedly rose last week by 10,000, to 424,000.
Some of the slowdown in growth was linked to bad weather in early 2011 and an 11.7 percent decline in defense spending.
Economists were cautious about forecasting a rebound in the second quarter, citing the rise in jobless claims and a moderation in factory output, which has been hit by disruptions to supply chains after the March earthquake in Japan.
"The second-quarter rebound is likely to be muted," said Nigel Gault, chief United States economist at IHS Global Insight in Lexington, Mass.
The economy expanded at a 3.1 percent rate in the October-December period. Economists had expected the first-quarter pace to be revised up to 2.1 percent.
The economy has expanded for seven straight quarters, but growth has been tepid by historical standards, leaving both the Obama administration and opposition Republicans scrambling for ideas to put it on a faster track.
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the nation's economic activity, expanded at a 2.2 percent rate in the first three months of this year, slower than the previously reported 2.7 percent.
After rising at a 4 percent clip in the fourth quarter, spending in the first quarter was slowed by high food and gasoline prices, which pushed inflation to its fastest pace in two and a half years.
The personal consumption expenditures price index rose at an unrevised 3.8 percent rate in the first quarter. That compared with the fourth quarter's 1.7 percent increase. The core index, which is closely watched by the Federal Reserve, advanced at a 1.4 percent rate, the quickest rate since the fourth quarter of 2009.
Fed officials would like to see this measure close to 2 percent. The lower rate suggests that the central bank will be in no hurry to raise interest rates once it concludes its $600 billion, government bond-buying program in June, analysts said.
"This may put off the day where the Fed starts normalizing interest rates until even further down the road," said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ in New York. "The Fed is going to want to see G.D.P. above 3 percent certainly before taking their foot off the gas."
Although consumer spending pulled back in the first quarter, economists hope a recent drop in gas and food prices will ease the pressure on household budgets.
The soft consumer spending overshadowed a $52.2 billion increase in business inventories, which was well above the initially reported $43.8 billion rise.
But a decline in vehicle production so far in this quarter because of shortages of parts from Japan could cause a drawdown in inventories and weigh on growth in the April-June period.
Motor vehicle output added 1.28 percentage points to first-quarter G.D.P.
The G.D.P. report also showed after-tax corporate profit fell at a rate of 0.9 percent in the first-quarter after rising at a 3.3 percent pace in the fourth quarter.
The drop in profit, the first since the fourth quarter of 2008, likely reflected a slowdown in productivity growth as businesses stepped up hiring. Economists had expected corporate profit to grow at a 2.3 percent pace.

Abstract: When the economy weakened in the first quarter, Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, and Obama administration officials said the slowdown was just a blip and growth would soon pick up. The White House and Congress, meanwhile, could begin talking about extending last year's temporary extension of business tax credits, household tax cuts and jobless benefits beyond Dec. 31.

Full text: The latest economic numbers have not been good. Jobless claims rose last week, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Another report showed that economic growth at the start of the year was no faster than the Commerce Department initially reported -- "a real surprise," said Ian Shepherdson of High Frequency Economics.
Perhaps the most worrisome number was the one Macroeconomic Advisers released on Wednesday. That firm tries to estimate the growth rate of the current quarter in real time, and it now says annualized second-quarter growth is running at only 2.8 percent, up from 1.8 percent in the first quarter. Not so long ago, the firm's economists thought second-quarter growth would be almost 4 percent.
An economy that is growing this slowly will not add jobs quickly. For the next couple of months, employment growth could slow from about 230,000 recently to something like 150,000 jobs a month, only slightly faster than normal population growth. That is certainly not fast enough to make a big dent in the still huge number of unemployed people.
Are any policy makers paying attention?
When the economy weakened in the first quarter, Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, and Obama administration officials said the slowdown was just a blip and growth would soon pick up. Today, many Wall Street economists are saying much the same thing: any day now, things will improve.
Maybe they will. But the history of financial crises shows that they produce weak, uneven recoveries, with unemployment remaining high for years. That history also shows that aggressive government action -- the kind of action Washington took in 2008 and 2009, but not for most of 2010 -- can make the situation much better than it otherwise would be.
The latest signs of weakness suggest that policy makers remain too sanguine. It is easy to see how the rest of 2011 could end up disappointing, much as 2010 did.
For one thing, there are specific forces holding back growth. Oil prices, though down in the last few weeks, are still 40 percent higher than a year ago and continue to siphon money away from the American economy to overseas economies. When I filled my gas tank last weekend, it cost $74, more than I think I have ever paid.
The housing market also remains in terrible shape. Europe is still struggling with its debt troubles. State and local governments continue to cut jobs.
These specific problems worsen the broader insecurity of both households and business executives -- insecurity that is typical in the wake of a financial crisis. Long after the crisis itself is over, businesses are slow to hire and quick to fire. Thursday's report on new jobless claims showed that they rose by 10,000, to 424,000, which is not a number associated with a solid recovery.
"Labor market gains may be faltering somewhat," Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist at MFR, a New York research firm, wrote to clients after the report's release.
For households, already coping with miserly wage growth, that is another reason not to spend. The Commerce Department's updated gross domestic product figures showed that consumer spending grew at an annual inflation-adjusted rate of only 2.2 percent in the first quarter, not the 2.7 percent rate the department initially reported.
The economy does still have some bright spots, and they could grow in coming months, just as policy makers and private forecasters are, once again, predicting. If North Africa and the Middle East do not become more chaotic, oil prices may continue falling. Vehicle production will probably pick up as the parts shortages caused by the Japanese earthquake end. The falling dollar will continue to help American exporters, as well as any domestic businesses that compete with foreign importers.
But there is no doubt that the economy has performed considerably worse in the last few months than most policy makers expected. The situation is now uncomfortably similar to last year's, when the economy sped up in the first few months only to stall in the spring and summer.
The most sensible response for Washington would be to begin thinking more seriously about taking out an insurance policy on the recovery. The Fed could stop worrying so much about inflation, which remains historically low, and look at how else it might encourage spending. As Mr. Bernanke has said before, the Fed "retains considerable power" to lift growth.
The White House and Congress, meanwhile, could begin talking about extending last year's temporary extension of business tax credits, household tax cuts and jobless benefits beyond Dec. 31. It would be easy enough to pair such an extension with longer-term deficit reduction.
Any temporary measures will eventually need to lapse, of course. But the current moment remains a textbook time to use them -- when the economy is struggling to emerge from the aftermath of a terrible recession. The one thing not to do is to turn to deficit reduction too quickly after a crisis, as Europe is painfully learning.
Almost four years after the mortgage market first began to quiver and unemployment began to rise, Americans are understandably eager for good economic news. But wishing for it doesn't make it so. You have to wonder whether the people in Washington have learned that lesson yet.

Full text: WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- The nation's economy remained sluggish early in the second quarter as high gasoline prices crimped consumer spending and bad weather helped push pending home sales to a seven-month low in April.
Consumer spending increased 0.4 percent in April for a 10th consecutive month of gains, the Commerce Department said on Friday, after rising 0.5 percent in March.
But prices rose 0.3 percent, leaving spending up just 0.1 percent and incomes stagnant when adjusted for inflation.
Tornadoes and floods, which lashed parts of the country last month, were blamed in part for an 11.6 percent decline in contracts to buy previously owned homes last month.
"We see the soft patch of the first quarter bleeding, at least, into the first half of the second quarter," said Robert Dye, senior economist at PNC Financial Services in Pittsburgh.
"We will see again a consumer that can keep pace with the economy, but cannot drive the economy forward."
Recent data including retail sales and industrial output have been soft, prompting economists to lower their growth forecasts for the second quarter. Further cuts are likely next week should May auto sales come in very weak.
Second-quarter forecasts for the rate of growth in gross domestic product are ranging from 2.5 to 3 percent.
The government reported on Thursday that consumer spending -- which accounts for about 70 percent of the nation's economic activity -- grew at a 2.2 percent annual rate in the first quarter, slowing from a 4 percent clip in the final three months of 2010.
That contributed to holding back overall economic growth to a 1.8 percent rate during the quarter after a 3.1 percent rate in the October-December period.
With much of the slowdown attributed to what United States policy makers see as temporary factors, like high commodity prices and supply chain disruptions because of the earthquake in Japan, the Federal Reserve is not expected to worry too much about the rate of recovery.
The central bank is expected to keep interest rates low after it wraps up its $600 billion government bond-buying program in June before it starts looking at ways to withdraw some of the stimulus it has lent the economy.
The high gasoline prices swallowed almost all the increase in incomes from tax cuts enacted in December.
Economists worry that stagnant incomes, which have failed to keep up with inflation, will continue to impede spending even though fuel prices are starting to fall.
So far, consumers have resorted to saving less, and some are tapping into their savings to maintain spending. Incomes rose 0.4 percent last month, but disposable incomes adjusted for inflation were flat for a second consecutive month.
Real incomes have not grown this year and the saving rate stayed at a two-and-a-half-year low of 4.9 percent in April. According to the Commerce Department's chief economist, Mark Doms, Americans saved $82 less over the last four months.
The retreating price for gasoline helped to lift consumer spirits this month and lower their inflation expectations.
The final version of the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey showed sentiment among Americans rose this month to 74.3, from 72.4 in the preliminary May reading.
High gasoline prices pushed up the year-on-year inflation rate to 2.2 percent, the biggest rise in a year, after increasing 1.8 percent in March.
Excluding food and energy, prices increased 1 percent, the largest gain since September, after rising 0.9 percent in March.

Full text: Most of us have no business managing our own investments.
We buy when prices are high and sell just as the markets are bottoming out. Or we cannot bring ourselves to sell investments that have done well to buy more of what hasn't. Or we buy on impulse, picking up individual stocks of companies we like and think we understand without much regard for how they may fit into an overall investing strategy.
Some of this behavior springs from a red-blooded insistence that we are all above average and can easily pick stocks and other investments that will outperform the market.
But our collective failure is also a result of the fact that we are literally left to our own devices. Advice from a human being is sorely lacking when we sign up for workplace retirement plans, and there is a severe shortage of moderately priced financial advisers who will help nonmillionaires and put customers' interests ahead of their own.
Someone will make a lot of money by coming up with a streamlined way to serve these investors, and two services called Betterment and Flat Fee Portfolios are among the latest to try.
Betterment is notable for an almost radical simplicity and its insistence that even someone with just $1,000 is welcome. The Flat Fee Portfolios model is built around a fixed price for advice no matter how big your portfolio is -- a far cry from the usual method of having customers pay, say, 1 percent of their assets each year in fees to the adviser.
Neither one may have cracked the code, but they are different enough from most of what's come before to be worth a look for those of us who recognize that we are constitutionally incapable of managing our own money.
First, a bit more about Betterment, which began operations last year. Once you decide how much to invest, you have only one choice to make: the amount of risk you want to take on. Once you've figured that out, there is just one portfolio to invest in (a mix of exchange-traded funds, which are index-fundlike investments that Betterment makes in United States stocks and government bonds).
The company lets anyone use the service, which is admirable in an industry where many financial advisers won't work with you unless you have more than $500,000 or $1 million, and even "discount" brokers may not manage your money for you unless you meet some kind of account balance minimum.
Betterment is pretty costly, on a percentage basis, for people with less than $25,000, though. Customers pay 0.9 percent in annual fees, which the company takes out of their investment account. The fee declines in three incremental tiers from there. For any money beyond $500,000, the fee is 0.3 percent.
Betterment's portfolio consists of six United States stock funds and two bond funds, which invest in short-term Treasury bonds and inflation-protected bonds. The company makes its portfolio public on its Web site, so there is nothing stopping you from mimicking it on your own. The company charges no trading fees beyond its annual fees, however, and it rebalances your portfolio for you. So Betterment is betting that enough people are willing to turn everything over to its service and will pay for the privilege.
But Betterment has two glaring weaknesses. First, there are no individual retirement accounts available, so you can't set up a Roth I.R.A. there or roll over money from a retirement plan you have at a former employer. Second, the portfolio has no international stock funds, a risky choice given all the questions about the American economy. Betterment's chief executive, Jon Stein, says the company will fix both of these problems this year.
He remains insistent, however, about sticking to just one blueprint for customers' investments. "We don't want to break that glass box and start having multiple portfolios," he said. "People will start picking things that have gone up the most recently, and that is a terrible choice. We want to be simple."
Flat Fee Portfolios offers a few more investment choices and even simpler pricing than Betterment. It's also aimed at more affluent customers, people who have six figures in money to invest but don't have the kind of broader financial planning needs that might merit an adviser who charges more money.
The fee is $199 a month if you have more than $250,000, and it does not grow no matter how much money you have. If you have less than that, you can enroll in a different program with fewer choices and less service for $129 a month.
At the $199 level, you can choose among three types of portfolios. There is one made up of actively managed mutual funds, an indexed portfolio of passively managed funds like the one that Betterment offers, or a portfolio that is more tactical and temporarily moves money to the sidelines when the markets get crazy. A real human adviser reviews your investments with you twice a year, and Flat Fee does the trades for you. At the $129 level, the portfolios are simpler and fewer in number and you have only one meeting a year.
Mark A. Cortazzo, Flat Fee's founder, named the service after the price offering in an attempt to hint at its conflict-free nature. Like a growing number of investment advisers, Flat Fee earns money only from customers, not from commissions from mutual fund companies.
But even that is no guarantee of a lack of conflicts. "If you have half a million dollars and I'm charging you 1.5 percent of your assets each year, and you call me wanting to take $100,000 to pay off your mortgage, the advice you are getting is conflicted," he said.
That is not how pricing usually works when advisers charge annual fees to customers. A financial services software company called PriceMetrix recently surveyed its clients who charge annual fees, from Morgan Stanley on down to smaller firms. It found that 37 percent of individual advisers were charging management fees of more than 1.5 percent a year on portfolios of $250,000 to $500,000 that have an even mix of stocks and bonds. Meanwhile, just 23 percent levy fees of less than 1 percent.
"There is no typical price," said Doug Trott, the president and chief executive of PriceMetrix. "It's a well-supplied industry, but it's not very competitive."
Whether Betterment and Flat Fee Portfolios can afford to stay in business in the lower pricing tiers is an open question. Betterment has about 4,000 accounts but the average balance is roughly $5,000 right now. It's hard to imagine that it will ever make money unless it attracts many more people.
Mr. Cortazzo, of Flat Fee Portfolios, said he had already made investments in the six figures in staff and his Web site, and he figured he would be spending more than he made for at least 18 months more. His financial planning firm, Macro Consulting Group, has $500 million under management; profits from that line of business allow him to invest in the Flat Fee part of the operation.
But he says he believes that his challenge is more about streamlining his service and efficiently finding his target customer than it is about competition. "Most small advisory firms don't have the staying power to get to critical mass to make this profitable," he said. "And the big financial services firms who could do this would cannibalize their existing business by coming up with model-based solutions with lower costs."
That said, there are some similar services. I've written about MarketRiders and AssetBuilder in the past. Folio Investing is another one worth considering.
Meanwhile, Vanguard, Fidelity, Charles Schwab, TD Ameritrade and E*Trade all have their own offerings. If you're considering any of them, check the fees and ask whether there's an investment minimum, whether they will trade and rebalance for you and whether they're using the very best funds or ones that the firm has created. (As usual, links to every service I've mentioned are in the online version of this column.)
Again, it's not at all clear which of these services, if any, is built to last. But their proliferation is a welcome development at a time when the number of advisers and institutions interested in helping people with smaller balances continues to shrink.
"A whole segment of customers is being dislocated," Mr. Trott said. "And there will be new opportunities for companies to satisfy their demands."

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration said Friday afternoon that China was not manipulating the value of its currency, choosing once again to avoid any escalation in the long-running trade dispute between the two countries.
The Treasury Department said the renminbi was "substantially undervalued" relative to the dollar. It said that the Chinese government worked to hold down the value of its currency by purchasing large amounts of foreign currencies.
But the Treasury said that did not rise to the level of manipulation, which would have put the United States on a road to economic retaliation.
The judgment was expected. Successive administrations have made the same finding every six months since 1994. Moreover, China has allowed its currency to rise about 9 percent against the dollar over the last year, including the effects of inflation.
The Treasury was careful to describe that progress as "insufficient," and to say that "more rapid progress is needed." The depressed value of the renminbi makes Chinese goods cheaper here and American goods more expensive there.
But Eswar S. Prasad, a professor of trade policy at Cornell University, said the issue had been reduced "from a flashpoint to an irritant" in the relationship between the countries.
"Tensions on this issue continue to simmer but the administration clearly wants to call a truce and instead focus on more substantive elements of the bilateral economic relationship," like increased access for American companies, Professor Prasad said.
The Treasury must tell Congress twice a year whether countries that trade with the United States are suppressing the value of their currencies to gain a competitive advantage. No nation has been cited since China was named in 1994.
Members of Congress from both parties have pushed the administration to take a harder line, arguing that China's obvious manipulation has deleterious consequences for the American economy. China spent roughly $197 billion on foreign currencies in the first quarter of 2011 to hold down the value of its currency.
Releasing the report on the cusp of a holiday weekend, however, kept immediate criticism to a minimum because most members of Congress already had left town.

Why Are Investors Still Lining Up for Bonds?

Abstract: Not a bit. Since April 18, the prices of Treasuries haven't fallen.

Full text: THERE is nothing more intimidating than the bond market, once it starts flexing its muscles. So said James Carville, the Democratic political strategist, after finding himself on the losing side of some bruising budget battles in the 1990s.
"Who the hell knew it was so powerful?" he said. "If it gets nervous, everybody has to calm it down. If I'm ever reincarnated, I want to come back as the bond market," Mr. Carville continued. "Then everybody will be afraid of me and have to do what I say."
But where is that fearsome bond market now? It has been docile, to say the least. Consider these events.
In mid-April, Standard & Poor's placed United States debt on negative watch, saying there was a one in three chance that over the next few years it would actually downgrade the Treasury's pristine triple-A rating. The agency cited concerns about the ability of Congress and the White House to agree on a plan to reduce the budget deficit.
On May 16, the Treasury hit its statutory debt ceiling -- the point at which the government cannot borrow more money without Congressional action. But Congress didn't act. To keep the government operating and bondholders paid, Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner announced a series of maneuvers that bought some time. The clock is ticking, however. If Congress doesn't enact legislation by Aug. 2, he said, the United States will default on its debt.
Has this melodrama shaken the bond market? Not a bit.
Since April 18, the prices of Treasuries haven't fallen. To the contrary. They've risen while yields, which move in the opposite direction, have plummeted. On Friday, the 10-year Treasury yield dipped as low as 3.05 percent, its trough for the year. Despite a mounting debt burden and a dithering government, Treasuries have rallied.
Factor in the pronouncements of the Federal Reserve, and the situation is even more puzzling. In its program of "quantitative easing," aimed at stimulating the economy and driving up asset prices -- QE2, as it has been called -- the Fed has been buying longer-term Treasuries. But it says it will end the program on schedule next month.
Any economics student knows that when you cut demand -- in this case, when the Fed ends QE2 -- all things being equal, prices ought to decline. And yet, despite the Fed's announcement, prices have risen and yields have fallen to extraordinarily low levels. Inflation-protected Treasuries, also known as TIPS -- those with terms ranging up to six years -- actually have negative real yields, meaning their yields are even less than the rate of inflation. Buyers are essentially paying the Treasury for the privilege of owning them.
"There's something wrong with this picture," said Scott Minerd, chief investment officer of Guggenheim Partners. He adds, however, that the picture is bigger than this. "Examine the rest of the world for a moment," he said in a recent interview. "Compare it to everyplace else, and the United States starts to look a lot better and a lot of this starts to make more sense."
Europe and Japan, the two other large advanced economies, face crises that are, arguably, far more acute. In the aftermath of an earthquake, a tsunami and a still unfolding nuclear disaster, Japan is struggling through a recession.
In Europe, the probabilities have risen that Greece will need another bailout or will need to restructure its debt or default on it. Ireland and Portugal, which have also needed bailouts, are also troubled, and the European Union has so far been unable to come up with a solution. Leaders of the Group of 8 nations meeting in Deauville, France, on Thursday and Friday failed to make significant headway on these issues.
Meanwhile, growth in red-hot emerging market countries like China has begun to slow, as their central bankers raise interest rates to limit inflation.
Given the alternatives, the bond market has found United States debt quite appealing. The market is convinced that in the end, Washington politicians will trim the budget deficit, Mr. Minerd said. If that perception were to change, the market would react with vehemence, he said. "I think everyone expects that Congress will come to its senses before it's too late," he said.
With signs that economic growth is slowing -- rattling the stock and commodity markets -- the Fed is likely to hold interest rates near zero for months, he said, and Treasury yields are likely to dip even lower, meaning more profits for bond traders.
By this summer, industrial growth will be visibly slowing around the world, said Lakshman Achuthan, the managing director of the Economic Cycle Research Institute, a private forecasting group. The markets have probably reacted to early indications of that slowdown, he said, bolstering bonds and hurting stocks and commodities. "Until there are signs of another pickup in economic growth," he said, "I wouldn't be buying on dips in the stock market." In this context, he said, Treasuries may seem a safer bet.
William H. Gross, the co-chief investment officer of the Pacific Investment Management Company, or Pimco, the world's biggest bond manager, ruefully compared investors in Treasuries to complacent frogs sitting in a pot of slowly heating water. "Bond investors are receiving almost nothing for their money, and the situation is getting worse and worse. But they've gotten used to it. They don't realize how bad it is. And before they know it, well, they'll be cooked."
Since early this year, Mr. Gross has been making statements like this, predicting the imminent end of the Treasury rally. "I was premature," he said, adding, however, that his arguments were valid, if not well-timed.
At some point, he said, bond investors will realize that by accepting low -- and even negative -- real yields, they are being "skunked." Using a fancier term, he said, they are experiencing "financial repression," a hidden tax that is of great benefit to the government, which will be able to pay back its debt more cheaply as time goes on.
IN a situation like this, wealth is transferred from investors to a debtor government without investors entirely realizing it, said Carmen M. Reinhart, an economist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. Ms. Reinhart, who has written extensively on the subject, says financial repression is still common in the developing world. Until the onset of the financial crisis, though, it had all but vanished from developed countries.
Now, she said, with debts mounting and central banks holding down interest rates, "We are beginning to see financial repression once again in developed countries like the United States."

U.S. Has Binged. Soon It'll Be Time To Pay the Tab.

Author: Morgenson, Gretchen

Abstract: Written with Marc Hinterschweiger, a research analyst there, the report states plainly: "That government debt will grow to dangerous and unsustainable levels in most advanced and many emerging economies over the next 25 years -- if there are no changes in current tax rates or government benefit programs in retirement and health care -- is virtually beyond dispute." The authors contend that such a program would "reassure the markets, keep interest rates low and instill greater confidence and certainty about future tax and spending policies, thereby encouraging businesses to commit their resources to job-creating investment projects."

Full text: SAY this about all the bickering over the federal debt ceiling: at least people are talking openly about our nation's growing debt load. This $14.3 trillion issue is front and center -- exactly where it should be.
Into the fray comes a thoughtful new paper by Joseph E. Gagnon, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, which studies economic policy. Written with Marc Hinterschweiger, a research analyst there, the report states plainly: "That government debt will grow to dangerous and unsustainable levels in most advanced and many emerging economies over the next 25 years -- if there are no changes in current tax rates or government benefit programs in retirement and health care -- is virtually beyond dispute."
The report then lays out a range of outcomes, some merely unsettling, others downright scary, that face us as a nation if we continue down the big-spending path we are on.
The report, "The Global Outlook for Government Debt Over the Next 25 Years: Implications for the Economy and Public Policy," arrives when our debt as a percentage of gross domestic product is around 65 percent and rising fast. Much of the recent increase, up from 43 percent in 2007, is the result of the panic of 2008 and the ensuing recession, when the government stepped in to mitigate the damage.
The authors do not suggest that policy makers should hurry to raise taxes or cut spending right now. They acknowledge that the economic recovery is still fragile and propose that lawmakers wait to implement budget cuts currently under discussion until 2013 to 2015. Additional cuts would ideally go into effect in 2016.
What needs to be done now is to design a long-term plan to reduce fiscal deficits in the future. The authors contend that such a program would "reassure the markets, keep interest rates low and instill greater confidence and certainty about future tax and spending policies, thereby encouraging businesses to commit their resources to job-creating investment projects."
An intriguing aspect of their analysis is how it views the rising tide of debt around the world from a historical perspective. For so many countries to be groaning under so much debt at the same time is unusual, the authors say. More typical are the somewhat contained debt crises, like in Latin America in the 1980s or in Russia in 1998. While both of those episodes reverberated beyond the countries from which they sprang, today's debt problems are far more widespread. And, as a result, more worrisome.
The simultaneous buildup of very large public deficits and debt positions in virtually all of the advanced high-income countries "is a new element at work in the global economy," the report says.
"It is unique in peacetime for so many countries to have so much debt," Mr. Gagnon said in an interview last week. But he added that global capital markets, and the access to lenders that these markets provide, probably mute the ill effects of this simultaneous borrowing binge.
The paper assesses the potential consequences of a more pervasive debt crisis, one involving a number of countries in the same perilous position at the same time. The authors also consider the impact that future interest rate increases may have on these debt loads and provide separate estimates of how debt levels would grow under differing circumstances. They incorporate into these estimates expected growth rates in various regions as well as rising health care costs and retirement obligations. The analysis uses figures from the International Monetary Fund and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development.
Some of the results are surprising. For example, the study rebuts the commonly held notion that the outlook for Europe is worse than for the United States, as far as debt levels and obligations are concerned. This is because some euro zone countries have already begun to deal with their fiscal problems, Mr. Gagnon explained. "They've made some changes to long-run pensions, such as raising retirement ages," he said, "and they've already made spending cuts and tax increases."
Another surprise in the study: emerging markets are in much better shape, Mr. Gagnon said, than he had anticipated when he began the project.
Now, to the numbers, all of which are based on the status quo in tax rates and government obligations relating to health care and retirement.
You sitting down?
Under a best-case outlook, according to the authors, the nation's net federal debt will rise to 155 percent of gross domestic product in 2035, more than double the current levels. (Net debt is defined as the government's financial liabilities minus its financial assets.)
Under a more pessimistic view on growth rates, that load ratchets up to 302 percent of G.D.P. that year. As the paper notes, "debt ratios of around 200 percent of gross domestic product are at the extreme limit of what advanced economies can experience without becoming destabilized."
Estimates for the euro zone fall well below these figures. Using an optimistic outlook for growth in that region, the analysis projects Europe's debt to rise to 72 percent of G.D.P. in 2035. Taking a dimmer view on growth brings the debt level to 155 percent of output in the euro area.
Taken over all, debt levels in the advanced economies would rise to 122 percent of G.D.P. given an upbeat outlook, or 234 percent under grimmer circumstances, the study projects. Both Japan and the United States exceed these figures in expected debt loads.
By comparison, emerging economies look positively robust. Using an optimistic projection, their debt comes in at 35 percent of G.D.P., and under more pessimistic circumstances, rises to 59 percent.
HAPPILY, Mr. Gagnon and Mr. Hinterschweiger do not believe a Greek-style crisis is in the cards for the United States. They say that we have some time to start addressing our debt problems -- five years at least. But given how our debt is growing, a fiscal crisis looms if policy makers do nothing.
"There may never be a single defining moment of crisis," the authors write, "but rather a drift into ever-higher inflation and interest rates, ever-lower growth or deeper recession, and eventually hyperinflation along with rapid currency depreciation. Most economists would view such a prospect as a progressive strangulation of a nation's well-being."
This is straight talk on a vital topic. Let's hope our leaders understand that living beyond our means will not be viable for a whole lot longer.

Abstract: Craig Franco, a coin dealer south of Salt Lake City, said he was finishing an arrangement with a bank to create a depository through which people will be able to spend their gold and silver indirectly, by using a Visa credit card that makes charges against the value of their holdings. Mr. Franco is among several supporters who say the law's most important feature may be that it eliminates state capital gains taxes on the sale of gold and silver, a move he thinks will prompt individuals and large scale investors outside the state to move their gold and silver to Utah.

Full text: FARR WEST, Utah -- Most people who amass the pure gold and silver coins produced by the United States Mint do so for collections or investments, not to buy Slurpees at 7-Eleven.
"You'd be a fool," Tom Jurkowsky, a spokesman for the Mint, said of the Slurpee idea, "but you could do it."
After all, while the one-ounce American Eagle coin produced by the Mint says "One Dollar," it is actually worth more like $38 based on the current price of silver. (An ounce of gold is worth more than $1,500.)
Now, however, Utah has passed a law intended to encourage residents to use gold or silver coins made by the Mint as cash, but with their value based on the weight of the precious metals in them, not the face value -- if, that is, they can find a merchant willing to accept the coins on that basis.
The legislation, called the Legal Tender Act of 2011, was inspired in part by Tea Party supporters, some of whom believe that the dollar should be backed by gold or silver and that Obama administration policies could cause a currency collapse. The law is the first of its kind in the United States. Several other states, including Minnesota, Idaho and Georgia, have considered similar laws.
Mr. Jurkowsky said the new law "is of no real consequence," and is purely symbolic, but supporters say it is more than political pocket change. They say that it is just a beginning, that one day soon Utah might mint its own coins, that retailers could have scales for weighing precious metals and that a state defense force could be formed to guard warehouses where the new money would be made and stored.
"This is an incremental step in the right direction," said Lowell Nelson, the interim coordinator for the Campaign for Liberty in Utah, a libertarian group rooted in Ron Paul's presidential campaign. "If the federal government isn't going to do it, then we here in Utah ought to be able to establish a monetary system that would survive a crash if and when that happens."
Utah has a strong conservative streak, but there are other reasons why it was first to pass such a law.
For many of its supporters, the new law represents an extension of the notion of preparedness that is nurtured by Utah's powerful founding institution, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Many of the law's supporters believe policies like stimulus spending, the bank bailout and national health care will soon bankrupt the government, sending inflation soaring. Owning gold and silver, they say, will help protect people.
"It's kind of written into our theology that we're supposed to be prepared for any eventuality," said Mr. Nelson, who was involved in early meetings with state lawmakers about the law.
Wayne Scholle, the marketing director for Old Glory Mint, in Spanish Fork, Utah, showed off a commemorative silver coin the company made honoring the new law, one he said he hoped could be a model for a future state-minted coin. The front -- or obverse -- includes an image representing "the miracle of the gulls," an important story in Mormon folklore in which seagulls are said to have suddenly appeared and eaten insects that were destroying the first crops Mormon settlers raised, a year after arriving in Utah in 1847.
"Their messaging is spot on with this," Mr. Scholle said. "It's preparedness. It's protecting yourself."
Old Glory is not the only company that hopes to benefit. Craig Franco, a coin dealer south of Salt Lake City, said he was finishing an arrangement with a bank to create a depository through which people will be able to spend their gold and silver indirectly, by using a Visa credit card that makes charges against the value of their holdings. Mr. Franco noted that state law, for now, left it to the private sector to figure out how conducting business with gold and silver should work.
"The regulation of the system?" Mr. Franco said. "There is no regulation of the system. We are working out the nuances of it."
Mr. Franco is among several supporters who say the law's most important feature may be that it eliminates state capital gains taxes on the sale of gold and silver, a move he thinks will prompt individuals and large scale investors outside the state to move their gold and silver to Utah. But federal capital gains taxes would still apply.
"I would hope the federal government would simply concede: 'O.K., you're right, it's money, so we can't tax it,' " said Larry Hilton, a lawyer and insurance broker who first took the idea to lawmakers. "But that may not happen."
Article 1, Section 10 of the Constitution says no state shall coin money, though Mr. Hilton and some others argue that a phrase used later, saying no state shall "make anything but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts" can be read as a license for Utah's new law and, perhaps, for a state's right to mint its own coins.
A spokesman for the Mormon church would not comment on the Utah law, but said in a statement that the church's teachings related to preparedness were "simply a matter of encouraging people to practice sound principles of provident living and to save for a rainy day."
State Representative Brad Galvez, the freshman Republican who sponsored the bill at the request of party leadership, said he was "not trying to push back against the federal government" but simply to "create an alternative" to the dollar that lawmakers hoped might send a message to Washington about fiscal policy. He noted that the law does not require businesses to accept gold or silver, but only gives them a choice.
Much of the logic of the law is rooted in the belief that the dollar is at risk and that gold and silver, coined around the world for thousands of years, are enduring, stable investments. That, too, is in dispute.
"From an investment standpoint, I've always found that if something is heavily advertised on television, it's not a good thing to do," said Gary P. Brinson, a philanthropist who spent 40 years as an investment strategist. "Right now, it's hard to find anywhere on television where you don't see gold and silver being advertised."
For all the excitement, so far, it is hard to find anyone who is using gold or silver to buy anything. But here in Farr West, about 40 miles north of Salt Lake City, there is at least some precedent for such transactions.
Decades ago, the rambling Smith and Edwards store, a kind of giant 7-Eleven from the Old West that sells everything from survival kits to sporting goods and copies of the Constitution, had a special sale, offering a very favorable rate if people made purchases with "junk silver" dollars and half dollars. In the 1980s, the store sold a man a $1,200 air compressor for a little less than 4 ounces of gold, recalled Bert Smith, one of the owners, who is now 91.
Mr. Smith said that he liked the new law, and that he was ready to accept silver and gold. But he does not expect to see much brought to his registers.
"I don't suppose there's going to be a big run on it," Mr. Smith said, "because people are going to hang on to their gold and silver more than ever."

Full text: WASHINGTON - Soon enough, Democrats will have to identify new Medicare cuts they can support.
But don't expect them to come this spring, not after the Medicare plan put forward by House Republicans became the centerpiece of the Democrats' strategy to recover from disastrous 2010 midterm elections. Last week's Democratic victory in a special House election in Buffalo ensured that.
The fat target on the Republican plan, drafted by Representative Paul D. Ryan, chairman of the House Budget Committee, is only one reason for Democrats to hold back. Why offer benefit cuts now, Obama advisers ask, after Republican leaders attacked their previous ideas for Medicare savings - and still won't bend on the need for tax increases in any grand deficit-reduction bargain?
"That would be crazy if we did," said Neera Tanden, a former health policy aide in the administration. In the current deficit-reduction talks led by Vice President Joseph R. Biden, the Medicare cuts under discussion fall into the modest "waste, fraud and abuse" category that no one opposes.
But reticence can only be a short-term tactic. It's not a long-term answer to the staggering spending projections that Mr. Obama, his Democratic predecessor Bill Clinton, and every policy analyst acknowledges will require further changes to Medicare.
"It is fair for Democrats to be asked to make additional contributions to cutting costs," said Andrew L. Stern, the former head of the Services Employees International Union, who served on Mr. Obama's deficit reduction commission last year.
Democrats have some answers. And their attacks on Mr. Ryan's option, over time, will bring escalating pressure to specify them.
A Start, But ...
The Democrats' first answer, Medicare spending cuts contained in Mr. Obama's health care law, won't satisfy partisan adversaries who see the law as a budget-busting monstrosity.
The Congressional Budget Office predicts spending on Medicare will nearly double in 10 years for two reasons. One is the increase in beneficiaries as baby boomers reach their golden years; the other is health care cost inflation that continues to outpace economic growth.
There's no stopping the former. But the new health care law seeks to restrain the latter through steps to overhaul payment practices and service delivery: better information on effective treatments, improved coordination among doctors, financial rewards for the quality of treatment rather than the quantity.
"This is not airy-fairy stuff," said Peter R. Orszag, Mr. Obama's former budget director. If an independent Medicare advisory board works as its advocates envision, its success in wringing out excess will ripple through the entire health care system, or so the thinking goes.
Some leading Republican policy experts agree that potential long-term savings from the law could be significant. "They've done a lot," said Mark McClellan, who ran the Medicare program under President George W. Bush.
But "there's a lot more" cost-cutting that needs to be done, Mr. McClellan added. "They've only got a partial plan."
Option No. 2
The Democrats' second answer: ratchet up the savings mechanisms in the health care law.
Mr. Stern says Democrats should guarantee the law's $500 billion worth of specified savings from reduced Medicare payments to health providers and insurers - by accepting a "trigger" for further cost-cutting if those savings don't materialize.
Mr. Obama has proposed further strengthening the Medicare advisory board. One possibility that would have an immediate impact would be to end the 10-year exemption hospitals were granted from the advisory board's jurisdiction.
But after raising the specter of "death panels" in the original health care debate, Republicans are sure to object to an increase of power for unelected bureaucrats, even in the name of reducing costs. That means that in any bipartisan compromise, the endgame would be cuts directly affecting beneficiaries - which Democrats have sought to avoid as energetically as Republicans have resisted tax increases.
The Congressional Budget Office has enumerated a series of options. For example, curbing subsidies for beneficiaries to buy supplemental "Medigap" insurance could save $92 billion by 2021.
Increasing premiums that beneficiaries pay for Medicare doctors' coverage so they cover 35 percent of the program's costs, instead of 25 percent under current law, would bring in $241 billion. Raising the eligibility age for Medicare to 67 from 65, a step also recommended by Mr. Ryan, would save $124 billion.
For Republicans, the core appeal of Mr. Ryan's "premium support" plan is the cap it places on Medicare outlays. That's also what makes it vulnerable to criticism from Democrats, who argue that it simply shifts costs from the government to the elderly - nearly $6,400 per beneficiary in 10 years, Mr. Obama says.
Yet increasing the level of Medicare spending per beneficiary at a faster rate than under Mr. Ryan's plan could produce significant savings without burdening the elderly nearly as much.
A bipartisan panel headed by the former Republican Senator Pete Domenici and a Democratic budget expert, Alice M. Rivlin, said such an approach could save Medicare $2 trillion by 2030. Which suggests that in a genuine long-term budget fix, probably after next year's elections, Democrats may end up doing business with Mr. Ryan after all.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.
