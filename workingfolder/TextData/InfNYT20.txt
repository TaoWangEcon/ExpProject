Full text:   Mario Draghi indulged the photographers and their rapid-fire shutters for a few moments, making his first appearance for the news media in the European Central Bank's ostentatious new high-rise headquarters in Frankfurt.
Then he shooed the cameras away. He had an important message to deliver.
Mr. Draghi, the central bank's president, told reporters on that early December afternoon that it was ready to deploy new weapons against the eurozone's dangerously low inflation rate. Though this 19-nation bloc is one of the world's richest economies, it has never really recovered from the 2008 global financial crisis. And low inflation is one of the impediments to growth.
Emphasizing every word, Mr. Draghi said that the bank's governing council had just agreed to prepare "for further measures, which could, if needed, be implemented in a timely manner."
In the past, such assurances had bought time for Mr. Draghi. His famous vow in 2012 to "do whatever it takes" to save the euro currency union had seemed to work without the bank having to actually take much action.
But on this day, after months of Mr. Draghi's saying the equivalent of "stay tuned," his statement of resolve failed to work the old magic.
European stock markets sagged even as he spoke. The reaction by investors, whose money and faith will be crucial to any true economic recovery, raised an ominous question: Is the man who is arguably the most powerful official in Europe really powerful enough to pull the eurozone out of its doldrums?
"A central bank claiming that it will do 'whatever it takes' while not delivering with actions eventually loses its credibility," said Athanasios Orphanides, a former European Central Bank board member who is now an economics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "It is difficult to escape the conclusion that the E.C.B. has not been operating in a manner that promotes fulfillment of its mandate."
Mr. Draghi's quandary is that the actions that might save the eurozone also threaten to divide it.
As he begins the fourth year of an eight-year term, the central bank has still not pursued the path that many economists say offers the greatest hope to millions of Europeans to escape from a "lost decade" of stagnation: buying government bonds and other financial assets in huge numbers. Such an approach, known as quantitative easing, was used successfully by the Federal Reserve in the United States. The idea is to pump money into the financial system, encouraging more lending and spending and kick-starting the economy.
Mr. Draghi continues to send signals that a bond-buying program is in the works. In an interview published on Friday, he warned of the danger that low inflation could cause people to delay purchases, in the expectation that prices will fall further. If so, that could be the beginning of a pernicious decline of expectations that would undermine consumer spending and business investment.
"History shows that falling prices can be as damaging to the prosperity and stability of our countries as high inflation," Mr. Draghi said in an interview with Handelsblatt, a German business newspaper. "The purchase of government bonds is one of the tools in our toolbox."
Yet even as Mr. Draghi tiptoes toward a bond-buying program, which could be unveiled as early as the central bank's policy meeting on Jan. 22, he faces challenges from inside and outside the walls of his new 45-story headquarters, which had a price tag of 1.2 billion euros, or $1.5 billion.
The 25 members of the central bank's governing council, who are supposed to be above parochial politics, often seem to represent the interests of their home constituencies. Members from Germany and other wealthier northern European nations have resisted the plan, fearing that their taxpayers would have to bail out the central bank if any eurozone countries defaulted on the bonds the bank bought. That fear has been reinforced by the rise of a left-wing populist party, Syriza, in Greece that is challenging the government's commitment to to meet its debt obligations.
But whatever differences he must bridge, many economists say Mr. Draghi is running out of time to deliver the decisive action needed to prevent low inflation from becoming a chronic condition. While low prices benefit consumers in the short term, extended low inflation, which could worsen into the widespread decline in prices known as deflation, imposes a heavy burden on borrowers and makes it hard for companies to be profitable, encouraging them to cut wages or lay off workers.
"I do think they're at a critical moment," said Thomas F. Cooley, an economics professor at the Stern School of Business at New York University. "There has got to be some attempt on the part of the E.C.B. to stimulate the economy. They are the only ones capable of doing the heavy lifting."
By some measures, Mr. Draghi, a 67-year-old native of Rome who earned a doctorate in economics from M.I.T., is at the peak of his powers. Wielding the moral authority he acquired after calming the markets and pulling the eurozone from the brink with his "whatever it takes" promise, he has overseen an expansion of the European Central Bank's jurisdiction.
Not only does the central bank manage a currency used by 338 million people, in November it also began regulating eurozone banks, which together constitute the world's largest banking system.
Given his purview, Mr. Draghi arguably has as much or more power in Europe than national political leaders like Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President François Hollande of France. And because he is appointed by European political leaders, he does not need to win re-election. (Mr. Draghi, who rarely gives interviews, declined to comment for this article.)
Yet in its core task -- to keep inflation below, but close to, 2 percent -- the central bank has fallen short. The last time the eurozone's annual rate of inflation was 2 percent was in January 2013. As of November 2014, the rate was only 0.3 percent, already low enough to have a pernicious effect on growth.
Under Mr. Draghi and his riven council, the central bank has also presided over a steep decline in the size of its balance sheet, the key measure of how much money it has been able to pump into the economy. That number has shrunk to about EURO 2 trillion from almost EURO 3 trillion early in 2012, as commercial banks repaid loans from the central bank.
The Federal Reserve, by contrast, which had a balance sheet about the same size as the European Central Bank's in early 2012, has since increased its holdings to $4 trillion from $3 trillion.
"I find the European policies to be baffling in terms of how bad they are," Frederic Mishkin, a former Fed governor who is now a professor of banking and financial institutions at Columbia University, said at a monetary policy conference in November. "If it's all about inflation, then inflation is way too low."
If Mr. Draghi feels wounded by such criticism, he does not show it. In public appearances, he exudes confidence. And he is not shy about dismissing his critics.
It's hard to imagine Janet L. Yellen, the chairwoman of the Fed, speaking to a member of Congress in the same tone that Mr. Draghi used to upbraid a Spanish member of the European Parliament who accused the central bank of strong-arming Ireland into accepting a bailout in 2010.
Raising his voice and sweeping his arm dismissively during an appearance in Parliament late last year, Mr. Draghi said the central bank had a duty to protect the money it had lent Irish banks after the financial markets cut them off. "Don't you think we should worry about that?" Mr. Draghi asked, with an irritation unusual for an otherwise supremely composed central banker.
Any fissures within the central bank's governing council, say those who have observed the dynamic, might be partly a result of Mr. Draghi's approach to management and diplomacy -- and impatience with lesser intellects.
There has been criticism -- mostly from people who did not want to be identified for fear of offending him -- that Mr. Draghi is aloof, especially when compared with his voluble predecessor, Jean-Claude Trichet. Mr. Draghi is known to confide in a small number of trusted colleagues, such as Benoît Coeuré, one of the six members of the executive board, who has a background in economics and public finance that is similar to Mr. Draghi's.
Others can feel left out of the loop.
Mr. Draghi's pledge to do "whatever it takes," for example, was an impromptu addition to a scheduled speech at a banking conference in London, according to a published transcript of an interview with Timothy F. Geithner, the former Treasury secretary of the United States.
With that comment, as he later made clearer, Mr. Draghi was alluding to the central bank's being ready to intervene in the bond markets, if necessary, to reduce the borrowing costs of Italy and some other eurozone countries, which had spiked to dangerous heights.
It was evidently a promise made without consulting the governing council. Only later did the council formalize the promise with a program -- as yet unused -- to buy the bonds of troubled countries.
Jens Weidmann, the president of Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank, and a member of the European Central Bank's governing council, has argued against more aggressive monetary stimulus and been a thorn in Mr. Draghi's side. On Dec. 17, for example, Mr. Weidmann told reporters in Frankfurt that he would regard quantitative easing "with skepticism," citing "the rather modest and uncertain impact of a broad Q.E. package, together with the risks and side effects it could bring and the unclear need for it at present."
He also said he considered the fear of deflation overblown. "An inflation rate below zero for a period of a few months does not yet constitute deflation in my opinion," said Mr. Weidmann, who declined several requests for an interview.
But after reports last fall of a growing schism on the governing council, Mr. Weidmann and Mr. Draghi have made a show of getting along. People close to them emphasized recently that they speak often, even if they don't always see eye to eye.
"It's fairly normal to disagree about things," Mr. Draghi said at a news conference in November, noting that central bankers in the United States, Britain and Japan also have their differences. "It happens everywhere."
All central banks face internal dissension, but Europe's is unique in that its members are separate countries. The eurozone is a currency union with a centralized monetary policy, but the member countries remain largely in control of their own budgets and regulatory policies.
The leaders of France and Italy, the second- and third-largest eurozone economies after Germany, seem unable to overcome resistance from trade unions and other interest groups over changes that promise to help improve long-term growth. Even Germany, the region's economic anchor, has lost momentum and barely escaped falling into recession in the third quarter of 2014, the most recent to be reported.
"I'm very, very concerned," said Lucrezia Reichlin, former head of research at the European Central Bank under Mr. Draghi's predecessor, Mr. Trichet. "Now the big risks are France and Italy."
Without a more aggressive monetary policy, Ms. Reichlin and a growing chorus of economists say, Europe has little chance of economic revival anytime soon.
"I certainly believe that both in Europe and in Japan, the willingness to tackle a declining inflation rate has been too gradual, and it's much less effective if it's gradual," said Eric S. Rosengren, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.
But in Germany, conservative opposition to large-scale asset purchases similar to those conducted by the Fed and the Bank of England borders on the hysterical.
"There is no country in the eurozone where monetary policy is debated in such a lively way and by so many citizens as in Germany," said Jörg Asmussen, a former member of the European Central Bank executive board and now a high-ranking official in the German labor ministry. "Even if you watch TV over breakfast, they are giving news about monetary policy."
German opposition to bond-buying reflects broader discontent with the way the common currency has, in the eyes of many Europeans, failed to deliver the prosperity it promised. In its most extreme form, this discontent manifests itself as a protest toward the whole idea of a united Europe, nourishing right-wing parties like the National Front, in France, and the Alternative for Germany.
If Mr. Draghi is fortunate, the eurozone economy will start to recover without a big central-bank intervention, and inflation will rise toward the 2 percent target. The plunge in world oil prices will provide some stimulus, but because fuel is usually priced in dollars, it is being partly offset by a weaker euro.
But the costs of delay are mounting. And now, even if the central bank finally does begin full-bore quantitative easing, there is no certainty that it will be enough to rescue the eurozone's creaky, highly regulated economy.
"Q.E. in the euro area is much less effective," Mr. Asmussen said. That, he said, is because bond-buying is most effective in economies like that of the United States, where the business world gets most of its financing through capital markets. European companies tend to get their money from banks.
"I think it could be a good thing," he said, "but I would warn against expecting the effects to be as large."

Abstract: [...]the proportion of global reserves held in dollars moved to 62 percent from 60 percent, and the euro's share fell to 22 percent from 24 percent. Japan is a prime example in this regard. Since the middle of 2012, the yen has lost a third of its value against the dollar, yet the growth in Japanese exports has been disappointing and the economy remains stuck in a deflationary slump.

Full text:   Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, may be pushing hard for a weaker euro to spur growth in Europe, but his central bank peers seem to be several steps ahead of him.
In an interview with a German newspaper on Friday, Mr. Draghi, known for using his public comments to achieve policy goals, said the threat of deflation might force his bank to take more aggressive stimulus measures, which could include buying eurozone bonds in bulk.
His comments prompted the euro to fall to $1.20, a four-and-a-half year low against the dollar. More important, it also highlighted a powerful new trend in world currency markets: Global central banks -- along with investors also wary of the low returns that their euros have been delivering -- have increasingly been switching into dollars and out of euros.
On Friday, the dollar also hit a multiyear high against the Japanese yen, and it was also gaining on the fragile currencies in Brazil, Turkey and Russia.
The expectation is that a rapidly recovering United States economy will push the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates this year, making dollar-based assets more attractive than those denominated in euros, Japanese yen and emerging market currencies.
By contrast, Europe's economy remains stagnant, and November's inflation rate of 0.3 percent was a blunt reminder of how far Europe's central bank is from meeting its inflation target of 2 percent.
To jump-start growth and avoid deflation, many analysts say the most powerful policy arrow in Mr. Draghi's quiver is to talk the euro sharply downward, which would bolster exports, increase the price of imports and ultimately, it is hoped, stimulate an increase in inflation.
"The euro is going to go down because it really needs to," said Jens Nordvig, the global head of currency strategy at Nomura in New York. "The divergence between European and U.S. growth is very, very wide now."
Mr. Nordvig pointed to recent data from the International Monetary Fund showing that in the third quarter of 2014, global central banks were big euro sellers and dollar buyers. As a result, the proportion of global reserves held in dollars moved to 62 percent from 60 percent, and the euro's share fell to 22 percent from 24 percent.
In an $11 trillion market, moves of this magnitude are highly unusual, and they could signal a long-term preference on the part of central bankers for high-yielding dollars in favor of less lucrative euros.
"This was shocking to me," Mr. Nordvig added. "And it really opens the way for a weaker euro."
The weakness in the euro on Friday came after Mr. Draghi, in an interview in Handelsblatt of Germany, said, "The risks of not fulfilling our mandate of price stability are in any case higher than they were six months ago."
Investors interpreted Mr. Draghi's comments to mean that the central bank was moving closer to broad-based purchases of government bonds, possibly as soon as its next monetary policy meeting, on Jan. 22.
"There are growing indications that the E.C.B. will decide as early as January to buy government bonds on a large scale," Ralph Solveen, an economist at Commerzbank, wrote in a note to clients on Friday.
Yields on government bonds in the eurozone also declined on Friday as their prices rose. The yield on the two-year German government note fell to a new low of minus 0.11 percent. The yield has been below zero since September; investors are effectively willing to pay the German government to keep their money safe. The yield on the 10-year German note fell to 0.49 percent, from 0.54 percent on Wednesday. The yield on the 10-year United States Treasury note fell to 2.11 percent from 2.17 percent on Wednesday.
The decline in the euro may have further to go. Many currency specialists expect the euro to weaken quickly to 1.18 or 1.17 against the dollar. But they caution that the time lag between a weaker currency and higher growth and inflation can be considerable.
Japan is a prime example in this regard. Since the middle of 2012, the yen has lost a third of its value against the dollar, yet the growth in Japanese exports has been disappointing and the economy remains stuck in a deflationary slump.
A strong dollar is a welcome reflection of a United States economy that is growing and adding jobs at a faster clip than many of its peers. But if the currency climbs too much too quickly, corporate profits can suffer. When the dollar is worth more against other currencies, it pushes up the price of American goods and services in overseas markets. This can lead to lower exports and weaker earnings for many American companies.
Douglas A. Kass of Seabreeze Partners, a hedge fund, said the rising dollar was most likely a reason behind the decline in a measure of United States manufacturing activity that was released on Friday.
"We are starting to see the impact of a higher U.S. dollar on domestic manufacturing," Mr. Kass said in an email. "This is one of the unintended consequences of a strengthening currency."
And while United States economic growth is largely driven by domestic factors, economists worry about the nation's ability to expand over the long term when its major trading partners -- Europe, Japan and China -- are experiencing growth slowdowns of various sorts.
Still, currency specialists note that the dollar's strong run started fairly recently and was preceded by more than a decade of persistent weakness. Measured against a basket of global currencies, the dollar remains 20 percent below its high in 2002.
Moreover, some analysts say the currency effect on American corporations may well be muted -- outweighed, over time, by the positive effect of a recovering European economy drawing in more exports from the United States.
Bank of America Merrill Lynch calculates that a 10 percent increase in the dollar against the euro would shave a little under 2 percent off the earnings of major exporters within the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index in 2015.
"It is not just a cut-and-dried currency effect," said Savita Subramanian, an equity strategist with Merrill Lynch. "There is also the global growth picture."
Mr. Draghi has, for the better part of a year now, tried to make the case that to stave off deflation and low growth, wholesale purchases of eurozone bonds must be considered.
Unlike central bankers in Japan, the United States and Britain, Mr. Draghi represents not just one country but the conflicting agendas of the 19 countries that use the euro. That includes the depression-hobbled Greece and the cash-rich Germany, which remains perpetually wary of the central bank loading up on risky eurozone bonds.
And while many analysts now expect him to formalize this decision this month, it could well be that Mr. Draghi's big bet for a European recovery is less the actual buying of the bonds in question, which will remain a politically draining exercise.
Instead, it could be a euro in free fall -- driven by central banks moving into dollars and the foreign currency traders that follow in their wake -- that does the job for him.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Abstract: [...]the exact opposite occurred: [...]the supply of bonds and safe fixed-income investments that investors could buy came down during the stimulus years.

Full text:   OVER the last three or four Januarys, the advice for investing in bonds has been remarkably consistent. It's gone something like this: Beware of them, because inflation is going to rise, interest rates are going to spike and bond holders are going to lose enormous amounts of money. When it came to losses, comparisons were made to what happened to equities in 2008.
There were exceptions to this analysis, of course. But for the most part, this view was repeated year after year, with charts, graphs and reams of historical data marshaled in its defense. On paper it made sense.
In portfolios, not so much. In fact, the exact opposite occurred: Inflation failed to materialize, interest rates went down, and bond holders made money on their investments.
But for investors, knowing what to expect from their fixed-income portfolio is essential. Bonds serve as ballast for rough times.
This year, the call is for the Federal Reserve to raise the target rate midyear by a quarter- to half-percent and for trading to push the yields on the 10-year Treasury to around 3 percent. Will it happen? Maybe, but then again. ...Jonathan Mackay, senior markets strategist at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, said recent predictions anticipated a normal recovery after a recession, which would have meant bond yields moving back to a range of 4 to 5 percent. The 10-year United States Treasury bond was trading this week around 2.2 percent.
"This doomsday scenario of significantly higher rates hasn't happened," Mr. Mackay said. "What firms got wrong, including us, is the pace of recovery has been slower than expected. Bond yields follow growth."
But seen from another angle, the interest rate the United States has to pay to borrow money for 10 years is far higher than that paid by economies that are not as solid. This shouldn't be. Germany and France both pay less than 1 percent on their government bonds; even weak economics like Spain and Italy have been paying less to borrow money, with both under 2 percent.
"People at this point are incredibly confused," said Heather Loomis, director of fixed income at J.P. Morgan Private Bank. "This is the point where people are at risk of throwing in the towel."
Ms. Loomis said there were at least three reasons for this situation. First, the global recovery hasn't been consistent. Those low European borrowing rates have pushed investors in those countries to put their money into United States Treasuries, driving down the yield.
Second, the supply of bonds and safe fixed-income investments that investors could buy came down during the stimulus years. "You had the Fed buying 80 to 90 percent of all the paper, but the supply was remaining constant or falling in certain years," she said of the Federal Reserve's programs of buying Treasury bonds.
Third, that adage of never betting against the Fed hasn't held true. "When the Fed says, 'We're going to raise rates,' and they don't, that's also influencing rates," Ms. Loomis said.
Of course, hindsight is perfect. Given the poor track record of recent predictions, how should investors think this year? "Money flows to the highest yield and that's the U.S.," said Marilyn Cohen, president of Envision Capital Management, which has $325 million invested in domestic bonds. "It won't be exactly the same script in 2015, but it will sound very similar."
She said that might not cheer United States investors who were used to much higher rates for decades. "Some mom and pops say, 'Who would want 2.15 percent on our 10-year?"' Ms. Cohen said. "Everyone who is outside the U.S., that's who."
For investors worried about Treasury rates rising suddenly, Mr. Cohen advises clients to buy bonds with shorter maturities, like one, three and five years.
Chris Dillon, a global fixed-income portfolio specialist at T. Rowe Price, said this year could bring the return of the historical link between 10-year Treasury rates and gross domestic product not adjusted for inflation, known as nominal G.D.P. "That's the alive and open debate for 2015," he said. "What makes the debate more complicated is the complexities of what's happening on the global stage."
For example, conventional wisdom says that lower oil prices act as a stimulus to consumers, which is good because consumer spending makes up 70 percent of American gross domestic product. But Mr. Dillon noted that companies in the shale drilling and fracking parts of the oil and gas industry borrowed to expand their operations and now, with lower oil prices, they could struggle and hurt gross domestic product. Another weight on the economy could be if the nascent recovery in Europe petered out -- or at least provoked anxiety.
"Ultimately, there is much uncertainty," Mr. Dillon said.
Of course, Treasuries are far from the only type of fixed-income investment. Mr. Dillon pointed to bank loans, municipal bonds and, for at least this year, lower-credit-quality bonds for higher yields.
Mr. Mackay of Morgan Stanley, who says he thinks the Federal Reserve will not raise rates until 2016, is still counseling clients on taking credit, not rate, risk on their bonds. (Credit risk, for example, would be high-yield bonds, while rate risk would be a bet on how the yield curve on Treasuries might shake out this year.)
"You still want bonds, even though yields are going to be lower, as an anchor to your portfolio," he said. "Inevitably you'll get some clients who say equities have done well and that's all I'm going to do. Down the road the equity market is going to collapse."
Similarly, Ms. Loomis said she had been talking to clients about the need to manage their portfolios with fundamentals in mind, even though certain markets have not been obeying those rules.
"I'd rather say, 'We didn't make you an additional 50 basis points,' as opposed to, 'We were managing against this trend and it went against us and we lost you 6 percent,"' she said.
In a time of uncertainty for fixed income, unconstrained bond funds promote their flexibility. They don't have to invest just in Treasuries, or in corporate bonds, or in any country or region. They invest in all of it as they roam the world searching for the best bonds. Some even add equitylike investments to the mix.
This is certainly true in some instances, but here skill matters: Just because a portfolio manager can roam the globe doesn't mean he is roaming it in a profitable way, any more than a manager confined to one class of fixed income is good at assessing credit and rate risk in just those bonds.
David Hoffman, co-lead portfolio manager of Brandywine's global fixed-income strategy, runs an unconstrained global bond fund that since its inception has beat both the World Bond index and the Barclays United States Aggregate Bond index, according to Morningstar.
"We've done generally well because we've had the opportunity to select where in the world is the best area for bonds and not just select in one country and get the timing precisely right -- that's really hard to do," Mr. Hoffman said. "More important for us is what we don't buy. If you don't own something, you don't make money for clients, but you don't lose money."
But the style of these funds, even Mr. Hoffman admits, isn't for everyone, particularly those investors concerned with how their investments are performing against a single benchmark.
Naturally, all of this thinking about fixed income may be wrong again this year -- at least that's the contrarian view of John E. Lekas, president and chief executive of Leader Capital and senior portfolio manager on the Leader Capital Total Return Fund.
"I'm going to tell you rates are going to stay low for a long time, longer than people think," Mr. Lekas said. "Countries are not being allowed to grow organically because of free lunch programs." Instead of inflation, he is worried about the risk of deflation, judging by indicators in the large and liquid markets for commodities, currencies and Treasury bonds.
"Those three pools of money tell me we're heading to a slowdown and it's going to hurt," he said. "All of a sudden we're going to get real pricing."
His advice for this year is asset-backed floating-rate bonds because they have higher credit quality than similarly yielding bonds. But his biggest piece of advice, and one he employs in his own fund, is to have some cash set aside for fixed-income investments that appear during the year.
"If you've got the cash, you can really get ahead of the game," he said. "If you don't have the money to execute your strategy, it doesn't really matter."
As for who will be right, there's only one way to know: Check back in 2016.

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDEDMOSCOW -- In the end, Russia's "white ribbon" opposition, which roared to life in December 2011 hoping to oust Vladimir V. Putin from power, came down to this: not quite two dozen stalwarts huddled all night inside an oversize Christmas tree ornament just outside the Kremlin walls, awaiting inevitable arrest. By morning, it came.
They were quickly removed from the ornament, a glittering white orb, the last stragglers of what had been a crowd of about 3,000 people who had gathered Tuesday evening to protest the conviction on fraud charges of Aleksei A. Navalny, the anticorruption crusader and Kremlin antagonist, and his brother, Oleg, who was charged along with him.
Mr. Navalny, who was perhaps the closest thing the white ribbon movement ever had to a leader, never made it to the unauthorized rally on Manezh Square. Although he broke out of house arrest, he was intercepted by the police about a block away from the rally and was forcibly returned to his apartment, where five officers were posted outside his door to be sure he did not leave again.
Russia's well-practiced riot police, known as the OMON, dispersed most of the crowd with devastating effectiveness. After trampling through a holiday gnome village set up on the square, they pushed most of the crowd into the underground passageways leading to the subway, arresting more than 100 people in the process.
That left the die-hards entrenched in the big glass ornament as a metaphor for the Russian political opposition movement as a whole: shivering and diminished, confident in the rightness of their cause, but also hoping for reinforcements that never arrived.
Their photos, posted on Twitter throughout the night as the temperature dipped to minus 6 degrees Fahrenheit and from the police van that carried them away, showed that some of them were mildly famous.
There was Maria Alyokhina, of the punk band Pussy Riot, who spent nearly two years in prison after being convicted of hooliganism for a protest against Mr. Putin in Moscow's main cathedral.
There was Maria Baronova, who spent six months fighting prosecution on charges of assaulting a police officer at a protest against Mr. Putin that turned violent in May 2012 but was granted amnesty in December 2013 ahead of the Sochi Olympics.
And there was Arseny Bobrovsky, half of the popular satirical duo @KermlinRussia, whose partner, Katya Romanovskaya, once awoke to find a 200-pound wooden penis had been left on the roof of her car.
The rest of the group were dedicated but unknown supporters of the anti-Putin movement, remnants of an uprising that for a few brief months in early 2012 had managed to consistently put tens of thousands of people on the streets of Moscow.
Steadily, firmly, Mr. Putin crushed them.
Like Mr. Navalny, a number of the best-known faces of the movement, people who stood on stage at the protests, have been prosecuted by the Russian criminal justice system. Others have fled the country fearing arrest, and still others have quietly moved on with their lives, as opposing Mr. Putin has seemed increasingly futile.
Sergei Udaltsov, the always black-clad leader of the radical-socialist group, Left Front, was convicted of conspiracy to overthrow the government, along with a top lieutenant, Leonid Razvozzhayev, who had tried to seek asylum in the West but was kidnapped in Kiev, Ukraine, and returned to Moscow. They are each serving four and a half years in prison.
Kseniya Sobchak, a television hostess and daughter of one of Mr. Putin's political mentors, Anatoly A. Sobchak, a former mayor of St. Petersburg who died in 2000, has mostly dropped out of the political limelight. She continues to host a television show on the independent Internet television station Rain, as well as a game show.
During the 2012 protests, Ms. Sobchak was part of an opposition movement power couple. Her boyfriend then, Ilya Yashin, was a main organizer of the protest and a leader of the People's Freedom Party, a group that included the former chess champion Garry Kasparov. (Mr. Kasparov, like many prominent opposition figures, now lives in self-imposed exile in New York.)
Ms. Sobchak broke up with Mr. Yashin and married a fellow television personality and actor named Maksim Vitorgan.
In an interview before Tuesday's verdict in which he was given a suspended sentence of three and a half years, Mr. Navalny said opposition leaders were simply intimidated, with 45 criminal cases opened against 20 members of the coordinating council that had organized the protests in 2012.
"People are afraid," Mr. Navalny said. "Totally destroyed."
He said that Mr. Putin had changed the stakes with the invasion of Crimea and military intervention in eastern Ukraine, where Russian soldiers have been dying, along with thousands of civilians.
"There is a war, people are dying," Mr. Navalny said. "They are taking down the tombstones of those Pskov paratroopers so that the names aren't written on their graves. And on the background of all this, discussion of corruption and elections and all of this, the main topics of the democratic movement, it looks, well, kind of silly."
The only prominent mainstream public officials to support the white ribbon movement, Gennadi V. Gudkov, his son, Dmitry G. Gudkov, and Ilya V. Ponomarev, who were then members of the State Duma, Russia's lower house of Parliament, have also come under severe pressure.
Gennadi Gudkov was stripped of his seat in Parliament in September 2012, after being accused of violating the law by operating a business while serving as a lawmaker.
Dmitry Gudkov remains in Parliament along with Mr. Ponomarev, where they are independents. Mr. Ponomarev was the only legislator to vote against Russia's annexation of Crimea; Mr. Gudkov abstained. Still, they face constant criticism or harassment.
Mr. Gudkov was accused of treason after a visit to the United States in March 2013; Mr. Ponomarev has been accused of embezzling money from Skolkovo, a government-financed research institute.
Reached by telephone in New York, where he was spending New Year's and having a delayed honeymoon, Mr. Gudkov said he believed that Mr. Putin had succeeded in suppressing the protests of 2011 and 2012, which were led by the urban middle class. But he said Russia's current economic problems would soon activate a much broader swath of society, as people feel the effects of high inflation, a weakened currency and budget cuts required by lower oil prices.
"Now, it's only middle class, but next year it will hit the rest of the people," Mr. Gudkov said. "In 2011 and 2012, it was the political protest, now we are expecting the economic protests."
He acknowledged that there appeared to be few leaders among the political opposition at the moment but said more than enough were waiting in the wings, including the well-respected former finance minister Aleksei L. Kudrin, who remains in Russia, and the former Yukos oil tycoon Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, who has lived in Switzerland since Mr. Putin pardoned him last year after 10 years in jail.
"We don't have leaders because it's impossible to develop in this political system, you have no access to the television, you have no access to other mass media," Mr. Gudkov said. "You can only use the Internet, but you know what's happening with Internet in today's Russia."
Mr. Gudkov said he believed Mr. Putin's sky-high approval ratings were illusory, a reaction to the manufactured image presented on government television. "Today you can have 80 percent, tomorrow you will have 20 percent," he said. "But we know that tomorrow we will have inflation, we will have an economic crisis, we will have the capital flight. People will lose their jobs."
In the freezing cold on Manezh Square, the large Christmas ornament's white lights made the protesters inside look like dolls caught in a snow globe. Some posed for photos in pairs, holding two hand-scrawled signs. One read, "We're in the globe," the other, "While Navalny's brother is in jail."
They gave interviews and chatted with the police, wrapped themselves in blankets, ate pizza and drank hot tea that froze if left sitting for too long.
At one point @KermlinRussia, which has more than one million followers on Twitter, posted, "We're waiting for you in the ball." The crowds never materialized.

Market Trends of 2014: What They Mean for 2015

Abstract: Rather, years of effort to increase drilling in the United States, paired with a continued tepid world economy and with decisions by Saudi Arabia and other oil producers not to pull back on production to defend high prices, created a stunning sell-off. Alan Greenspan called it a "conundrum" -- that the Fed's power to influence longer-term interest rates was weak, perhaps because of very strong global demand for safe securities like United States Treasury bonds.

Full text:   It was a confounding year in global financial markets. Not because it was a disaster for most investors; American stocks and bonds both rose in value. It was confounding because of some major moves that defied expert consensus this time a year ago -- not only what was predicted, but what was even thought plausible.
But by understanding what the biggest market moves were, you can also understand the forces that will shape the global economy in 2015.
There was an epic collapse in oil prices.
It's not that the price of oil has never moved as far and as fast as it did in 2014. It's just that usually when that happens, it occurs against the backdrop of much more global volatility, like in a worldwide recession at the end of 2008 and early 2009.
What's remarkable about the roughly 50 percent decline in the price of oil in the second half of the year is that it occurred amid such stability; nothing radical changed in that time about either the global economic outlook or even the supply and demand picture for oil itself.
Rather, years of effort to increase drilling in the United States, paired with a continued tepid world economy and with decisions by Saudi Arabia and other oil producers not to pull back on production to defend high prices, created a stunning sell-off.
We've already started to see some of the geopolitical consequences of this shift, including the collapse in value of the ruble and new pressure on the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. But that is probably only the beginning. The budgets of major oil producers, from Venezuela to Indonesia to Texas, will be stretched. Meanwhile, there will be a nice tailwind to growth around the world as cheaper fuel means higher real incomes for consumers.
This was the year when oil prices plunged, but 2015 is the year when we will truly start to understand the consequences.
Long-term interest rates kept falling.
If there was one thing Wall Street forecasters could agree upon at the end of 2013, it was that 2014 would be a year of rising long-term interest rates in the United States. The economy was finally gaining momentum, after all, the Federal Reserve was winding down its program of buying bonds, and the day of interest rate increases was coming nearer.
That narrative was exactly right when it came to the economy and policy. The job market has strengthened, and the Fed has moved to end its interventions in the economy as planned. But the result for bond markets has been the opposite of the conventional wisdom.
The yield on United States Treasury bonds fell significantly over the course of the year; the government can borrow money for 30 years for a mere 2.8 percent, down from 4 percent at the end of 2013. These lower costs have translated into cheaper home mortgages and lower borrowing costs for businesses, and higher bond prices (but lower future returns) for investors.
As for 2015 implications, the remarkably low long-term interest rates would seem to signal a return to a predicament facing the American economy in the middle of the last decade. Alan Greenspan called it a "conundrum" -- that the Fed's power to influence longer-term interest rates was weak, perhaps because of very strong global demand for safe securities like United States Treasury bonds.
Regardless of the cause, it raises the prospect that even as the economy continues to strengthen and the Fed raises rates in 2015, cheap longer-term rates will be here to stay.
The U.S. stock market kept cruising.
The stock market had a remarkable rally in 2013, and some were skeptical that it could continue the run in 2014.
It did. But only in the United States.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 11.4 percent in 2014, not quite the 30 percent return of 2013 but not shabby by any measure. But while 2013 featured a broad rise among all the major global stock markets, the United States was a major outperformer in 2014.
The core reason is that the American economy has performed better than its counterparts in much of the rest of the world, with Europe and Japan facing stagnant growth and emerging markets slowing their once-gangbuster pace. A related factor is that the dollar has appreciated compared with other currencies, so the dollars that American companies make are becoming relatively more valuable.
Yet another year of stock prices that rise faster than corporate earnings certainly increases the risk of a sharp correction or a period of subpar returns. But in the meantime, Americans can take comfort in the fact that the referendum of global financial markets is that the United States will continue to be the driver of global economic recovery.
The dollar soared.
The same fundamentals that helped American stocks log another year of impressive returns drove up the dollar versus virtually all other major currencies -- but a solid year for United States economic growth wasn't the entirety of the story.
A schism has opened up between the Federal Reserve and its counterparts overseas. The European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan are trying to stimulate growth and fight deflation in their countries (the B.O.J. has already expanded its easing programs, and the E.C.B. appears on the verge of undertaking a form of bond-buying of its own). But the Fed has been signaling higher rates and tighter money.
That has made the dollar more attractive, as has the sense that it is a beacon of economic strength in a troubled world economy. Those factors explain the 12 percent drop in the euro against the dollar and the 14 percent drop in the Japanese yen.
But the strengthening dollar has implications for 2015 far beyond the finances of Americans thinking of visiting Paris this spring.
The dollar is sufficiently enmeshed in the infrastructure of the global economy that a stronger dollar means, in effect, a tightening of global financial conditions, as Hyun Song Shin of the Bank for International Settlements has argued.
If you are a company doing business in Mexico or South Korea, for example, and borrow money in dollars, a rising dollar makes repaying your debts more onerous and has the same effect as a hike in interest rates, potentially squeezing your cash flows or even leading to bankruptcy. Look for those ripple effects of a strong dollar across the globe in 2015.
The outlook for inflation fell.
Global investors are betting on very, very low inflation, for many years to come. That is the implication, anyway, of the relative prices of inflation-adjusted bonds and regular bonds in the United States and almost every other major economy.
Part of this is easy to explain. The decline in oil and other commodity prices will put downward pressure on prices in 2015. But a broader shift in sentiment happened in recent months. Investors seem to think that very low inflation will persist even after the oil price declines of the last few months fully spread through other consumer prices. Bond prices currently imply that inflation from 2019 to 2024 will be 2.14 percent a year, down from 2.65 percent a year ago.
Investor expectations suggest that the Fed may have more leeway than it had seemed a few months ago to keep interest rates low, especially if they see continued weakness in the economy.
And given that similar trends are visible across the advanced world, it implies that one of the foremost challenges for policy is finding a way to get the world's major economies humming enough that deflation is no longer a concern.

Abstract: Nine states are increasing their minimum wage levels through automatic adjustments for cost-of-living expenses and other economic factors. Despite the popularity of minimum wage increases in many states, including those dominated by Republicans, and favorable attitudes toward higher minimum pay expressed in many public opinion polls, the federal proposals are unlikely to gain much traction in 2015, especially now that Republicans control the House and the Senate.

Full text:   For some low-wage workers, everyday tasks like spending money for bus fare to get to and from work also involve deciding which bill to pay or delay, or what to give up.
Rita Diaz, 26, who works two low-wage jobs, sometimes walks the three miles home from her job serving chicken at a Popeye's fast-food restaurant in Roslindale, Mass., when she doesn't have money for all of her expenses. Her plight is one of many highlighted by labor advocates who have been pushing for higher minimum wage levels.
In January, with an increase in the minimum wage in Massachusetts taking effect -- raising hourly pay to $9 from $8 an hour -- Ms. Diaz envisions being able to walk less and ride more.
"I need to make a decision to buy clothes, or pay the rent or pay my cellphone bill," she said. "Now I've got to do that decision, but I'm going to have more money for me, too. A little bit of money for me."
By Thursday, minimum wage increases will go into effect in 20 states, including Massachusetts, as well as in the District of Columbia. A few other states will enact a pay bump later in the year.
All told, 29 states will exceed the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour at the beginning of January, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
The initial changes will enhance minimum pay by as little as a few pennies to as much as $1.25 an hour, affecting about 3.1 million employees, according to the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal research group.
"That's going to be unnoticeable, really," Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution, said of some of the smaller changes, like the extra 12 cents an hour in Florida and 15 cents an hour in Missouri. "If you're talking about an increase of a buck or two bucks, then maybe there's some kind of noticeable effect."
Nine states are increasing their minimum wage levels through automatic adjustments for cost-of-living expenses and other economic factors. Increases in the other states occurred through legislative or ballot changes. Over all, the new laws will cover about 60 percent of the nation's work force, according to the Economic Policy Institute.
"If you're only making 15 or 16 thousand dollars year, an extra two grand is quite a bit of money," said David Cooper, an economic analyst at the institute.
The smaller of the automatic increases in nine states will raise wages for about 4 to 7 percent of the lowest-paid workers, according to the institute, while the bigger increases will affect more. Nearly one-fifth of all wage earners in Minnesota will see a bump in pay when the wage floor jumps by $1 later in the year.
About 3.3 million people earn the federal minimum wage or less, according to the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics.
As the wealth gap between the rich and poor has expanded, the battle over wages for some of America's lowest-paid workers has intensified.
The federal minimum wage has not been increased since 2007. President Obama has proposed raising it to $10.10 an hour, but that effort has stalled in Congress.
Despite the popularity of minimum wage increases in many states, including those dominated by Republicans, and favorable attitudes toward higher minimum pay expressed in many public opinion polls, the federal proposals are unlikely to gain much traction in 2015, especially now that Republicans control the House and the Senate.
The White House says 28 million workers would be affected if the president's increase were passed into law.
In the last year, as they faced considerable obstacles at the federal level, some labor advocates worked to put measures on the ballot in various states while other measures passed through state legislatures. In November, four states -- Alaska, Arkansas, Nebraska and South Dakota -- passed initiatives to increase the minimum wage. A few big cities have also raised the minimum.
"I think this issue is not going away until action is taken at the federal level, just because the federal minimum wage is so low compared to where it was historically and what it takes people to get by," Mr. Cooper, the Economic Policy Institute analyst, said.
Adjusted for inflation, the federal minimum wage in 1968 would equal about $10 today, he said.
Last year, half of the people who received charitable food assistance in the United States, from places like soup kitchens, came from households where at least one person worked, said Jeffrey Buchanan, senior domestic policy adviser at Oxfam America. Mr. Buchanan said that most of those people earned a low or minimum wage.
Business associations have traditionally opposed efforts to raise workers' pay, saying that employers will be forced to cut jobs and hours.
"The likeliest scenario won't be layoffs, it'll be employers on a broad scale finding ways to avoid creating new jobs," said Jack Mozloom, a spokesman for the National Federation of Independent Business, a trade group. "They simply won't replace workers who leave or they'll find ways to automate in order to avoid hiring new people. The jobs will disappear quickly."
Mr. Burtless, the Brookings economist, contended that new higher wages would "more than offset" the loss of earnings associated with a drop in employment. The new rules will give workers an extra $1.6 billion next year, according to the Economic Policy Institute.
A spokeswoman for Walmart, the nation's largest employer, said the company could "absorb the costs" of the changes, which she said would not affect its prices or staffing.
A spokeswoman for Target, another top employer, said in an email that she was "not aware of any plans" to raise prices or cut staff.
Come Thursday, at $9.47, Washington State will offer the highest statewide minimum wage, followed by Oregon at $9.25.
Some states have also staggered their minimum wage increases. Massachusetts, where Ms. Diaz works, will raise it to $11 by 2017.
"It's not going to be a lot, but it's going to be more than $8 an hour," she said of the January increase. "It's going to be more food."

Abstract: European Central Bank policy makers are increasingly worried about "the very high risk that after seven years of crisis and very poor economic performance in the euro area, businesses and households are reducing their long-term growth expectations and adapting to weak growth and low inflation," Mr. Praet said.

Full text:   FRANKFURT -- A top official of the European Central Bank said in an interview published on Wednesday that measures taken so far to stimulate the eurozone economy might not be adequate and that the central bank might need to do more.
The comments by Peter Praet, a member of the central bank's executive board, strengthened expectations that the central bank is moving closer to broad-based government bond purchases as a way of pumping money into the economy.
Added impetus, Mr. Praet said, could come from the additional drag on consumer prices as a result of the recent drop in crude oil prices. While he said that "the risk of broadly based deflation in the euro area is not high," he noted that oil's slump "could mean negative inflation during a substantial part of 2015."
In an interview with Börsen Zeitung, a German financial newspaper, Mr. Praet said the steps taken so far might not be enough to raise inflation from a level considered dangerously low because it undercuts corporate profits and makes it more difficult for borrowers to repay their debts.
"There is the risk that we won't have achieved the degree of monetary accommodation that we had intended," Mr. Praet said, according to a translation of the interview on the E.C.B. web site.
Noting that eurozone inflation could be even lower next year than the 0.7 percent forecast by E.C.B. economists, he added, "This is why we have to be very vigilant and ask ourselves: Have we done enough?"
The statement by Mr. Praet, along with recent signals from other high-ranking E.C.B. officials, suggest that action is increasingly likely at the next monetary policy meeting, on Jan. 22.
But the central bank could delay an asset purchase program to bring dissenting members of the policy-making governing council on board, or simply to allow more time to make preparations for what would be a huge and complex intervention in bond markets. Political turmoil in Greece could delay asset purchases, because the E.C.B. might be reluctant to acquire debt that a new Greek government might not repay.
Mr. Praet said there was a danger that businesses and consumers were becoming resigned to low growth and low inflation, and as a result were not investing and spending. If so, that would be one of the symptoms of deflation -- a broad-based decline in prices that causes people to delay purchases, company profits to sink and unemployment to rise.
European Central Bank policy makers are increasingly worried about "the very high risk that after seven years of crisis and very poor economic performance in the euro area, businesses and households are reducing their long-term growth expectations and adapting to weak growth and low inflation," Mr. Praet said.
"The big risk is that this growth pessimism perpetuates the current situation of weak growth and low inflation," Mr. Praet said.
Many economists as well as central bankers in other countries have expressed concern that the E.C.B. has already waited too long to address very low inflation. Prices rose at an annual rate of 0.3 percent in the eurozone during November, and some analysts expect inflation to have fallen further during December or even to have turned negative. An official estimate of December inflation will be released on Jan. 7.
An asset purchase program in the eurozone would be more complicated than the quantitative easing used by the Federal Reserve to stimulate the American economy. The Fed bought large quantities of United States Treasury bonds, but the eurozone has no comparable asset. The E.C.B. would have to buy bonds of individual eurozone countries, which will number 19 when Lithuania joins on Thursday.
Mr. Praet said the E.C.B. might buy government bonds in the secondary market in proportion to the size of each country's outstanding debt. That approach could be controversial, because it would tend to reward the most indebted countries, like Greece and Italy.
Mr. Praet acknowledged that the E.C.B. risked rewarding bad behavior, a practice known as moral hazard.
"Moral hazard is an issue for monetary policy, I don't deny that," he said. "At the same time, it cannot be an excuse not to act if you come to the conclusion that this is needed, given your mandate."

Abstract: The stock market in 2014 also reflected significant shifts in the business world and wider society. Alibaba, the dominant Chinese online retailer, executed the largest initial public offering ever in September, issuing $25 billion of stock on the New York Stock Exchange.

Full text:   An accelerating United States economy trumped problems overseas to lift the stock market to new highs in 2014.
Despite losses for the day in light pre-holiday trading, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed on Wednesday with a gain of 11.39 percent for 2014 -- 13.68 percent when reinvested dividends are included. It was the third consecutive year that the market benchmark has risen by more than 10 percent.
Other market measures also ended the year on a strong note. The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 7.52 percent for 2014, while the Nasdaq composite index ended up 13.4 percent.
Can the party in American stocks keep going in 2015?
"We don't see a lot on the horizon that could derail the U.S. market in particular," said Raymond Nolte, chief investment officer at SkyBridge Capital, an investment firm focused on hedge funds. "But there could be continued volatility."
The market's astonishing ascent began in early 2009, when the newly elected Obama administration was scrambling to revive the economy and right the teetering financial system. The run-up has now lasted nearly 70 months, making it the fourth-longest bull market since World War II, according to data from S.&P.
In recent months, investors have encountered deterrents that might have thwarted the market's progress. The Federal Reserve, for instance, recently wound down its enormous bond-buying program, which had helped drive stocks higher. The economies of Europe and Japan remain fragile, despite big efforts to turn them around. The conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, as well as an unexpectedly steep plunge in oil prices, have gnawed at confidence.
Investors, however, appeared to anticipate that the United States economic recovery would gather pace in 2014. As that materialized in the second half of the year, the stock market kept rising, and was even able to bounce back from two big sell-offs, in October and early December.
On the year's last trading day, the S.&P. was down 21.45 points, or a bit over 1 percent, at 2,058.90. The Dow dropped 160 points, or 0.9 percent, at 17,823.07, and the Nasdaq fell 41.39, or 0.87 percent, to 4,736.05.
But the losses didn't dim the 2014 rally, which was remarkable for other reasons.
After 14 years, the S.&P. 500 finally, in late 2014, rose to a new high on an inflation-adjusted basis, according to data compiled by Professor Robert J. Shiller of Yale.
Retail investors, after sitting on the sidelines after the financial crisis of 2008, started to put money back in the market in 2013, allowing them to benefit from 2014's advance. Increases in the value of stocks and mutual funds have led to over $7 trillion of gains to household wealth over the last three years, according to data from the Federal Reserve. But the wealthiest families have benefited more from the rally than middle-income households, since they have had a greater share of their savings invested in securities markets, according to recent research by Edward N. Wolff, an economics professor at New York University.
The stock market in 2014 also reflected significant shifts in the business world and wider society.
A torrent of corporate mergers, for instance, helped drive stocks higher. Allergan, the maker of Botox, was the target of a fierce takeover battle, which ultimately helped lift its shares 91 percent in 2014, the fourth-best in the S.&P. 500.
Alibaba, the dominant Chinese online retailer, executed the largest initial public offering ever in September, issuing $25 billion of stock on the New York Stock Exchange. Its shares are now 53 percent higher than the price at which they were offered.
The dominance of Facebook in people's lives drove its strong stock market performance. Its ballooning profits, derived from advertising revenue, helped lift the company's shares by 43 percent in 2014. But not all technology giants fared well. Shares of Amazon, for instance, plunged 22 percent, as doubts about its ability to generate profits deepened. IBM's shares fell 14.5 percent as its long-term plans disappointed.
A near halving in the price of crude oil in 2014 was bad news for many energy companies. Shares of Halliburton, which provides products and services to energy firms, fell 22.5 percent in 2014. But the decline in the cost of fuel was a big boon for airlines. Southwest Airlines' stock rocketed 125 percent in 2014, making it the top performer within the S.&P. 500.
Still, there were reasons to doubt the stock market's roaring display.
The bond market, for instance, has not signaled the same optimism as the stock market. Economic strength typically causes government bonds to decline in price, pushing up their yields. Yet the yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.17 percent on Wednesday from 3.03 percent at the end of 2013 -- a move that few analysts had forecast. Bond investors who did anticipate the decline in yields contend that strong forces within the economy will continue to limit growth. But a rise in yields in 2015 on the back of a strong economy may bring its own dangers. A spike in yields in 2013, for instance, shook global markets.
A sharp rise in Treasury yields in 2015 could step up the pace at which money is flowing out of developing countries. The exodus is damaging their economies and straining their financial systems. Such stresses could then become a hurdle for the United States economy.
"The biggest risk to developed markets is emerging markets," said Atul Lele, chief investment officer at Deltec International Group.
A decrease in the appetite for riskier investments is also hitting American corporations, like highly indebted energy companies. A contraction in the energy sector could then end up hurting other parts of the economy.
In this environment, the spotlight on the fundamental performance of companies on the stock market will intensify in 2015. Many Wall Street analysts contend that the market is reasonably valued right now, arguing that corporate earnings support current stock prices. The stocks in the S.&P. 500 index, for instance, trade at close to 16 times the profits that analysts expect for 2015. That multiple is more or less in line with the historical average.
But the skeptics point to other measures. A measure of stock market valuation developed by Professor Shiller suggests that stocks are getting expensive. His so-called cyclically adjusted price-earnings ratio is currently 50 percent higher than its average level since the end of World War II.
A measure of valuation that Warren E. Buffett has cited is also flashing a warning sign. It compares the total value of the American stock market with the country's gross domestic product. Right now, the companies in the Russell 3000 index are valued at close to $25 trillion, which is just over 40 percent higher than G.D.P. The last time that ratio was higher at year end was in 1999, the year before the stock market plummeted.
Profits may not be as strong as they look.
In recent years, companies have spent large amounts of cash buying back their shares. This reduces the number of shares a company has outstanding and thus bolsters its earnings-per-share, a measure of profitability that investors favor.
The question now is whether companies on the stock market have spent too much money on share buybacks and too little on improving the productivity of their own operations. In 2014, for instance, the companies in the S.&P. 500 bought back $438 billion of their own stock, according to data from FactSet. That sum is equivalent to 93 percent of the amount that the companies spent on their own capital expenditures. The 2014 percentage is higher than in any year since 2007.
The bulls argue that other measures of earnings power -- like profit margins -- look strong. But the skeptics say such metrics are also likely to weaken as costs rise.
"What we are looking forward to at some point is the combination of strongly rising interest rates and falling profits -- and that is not a nice combination for markets," said Andrew Smithers, the founder of Smithers & Company, an economics consulting firm.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text:   Bad Loans for Troops
Consumer protection groups and advocates for military personnel have strongly supported rules proposed by the Obama administration that would better protect service members from predatory loans that trap them in debt and place them at risk of being forced out of the military.
The rules, which deserve to be finalized and put into effect soon, would close glaring loopholes in the Military Lending Act of 2007, which sought to alleviate this problem by applying a 36 percent rate cap on some credit products, including vehicle title loans and payday loans.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau lent support to the proposed rules this week in a report containing examples of how the current rules leave military families vulnerable to deceptively packaged, ruinously priced loans.
In calling for stronger protections, the bureau's director, Richard Cordray, said: "The current rules under the Military Lending Act are akin to sending a soldier into battle with a flak jacket but no helmet."
Higher Minimum Wages
An estimated 3.2 million low-wage workers will get a raise on Thursday, as 21 states begin 2015 with higher minimum wages.
Nine of those states have laws that require the state minimum to rise each year with inflation. The remaining 12 recently passed legislation or approved ballot measures to lift their minimums on New Year's Eve or New Year's Day.
The push for higher minimums is a testament to the activism of low-wage workers for better pay and an indictment of the outdated and inadequate federal minimum of $7.25 an hour. In all, 29 states and the District of Columbia will have hourly minimums in 2015 greater than $7.25 -- the first time that most states will exceed the federal level.
Democrats in Congress have proposed a gradual increase in the federal minimum to $10.10 an hour, but, so far, Republicans remain opposed to even that modest raise.
Blood Donation Policy
Last week the Food and Drug Administration scrapped its ban on blood donations by gay men and replaced it with a different ban. The old rule stated that any man who had had sex with another man since 1977 was permanently "deferred" from giving blood. Under the new rule, any man who has had sex with another man in the last year may not donate.
The GMHC, an advocacy group, said the new policy was "offensive" while AIDS United, another advocacy group, said it perpetuated "discrimination."
It's also illogical. It lumps together gay men who practice safe sex with those who don't, and irrationally excludes gay men in monogamous sexual relationships. It would be better to adopt the policy used in Italy and Spain of individualized risk assessment, in which potential donors are screened for high-risk practices and then deferred on a case-by-case basis.

Full text:   For average American families, the United States economy is like a football team that cannot move the ball, and has not been able to for 30 years.
That is why frustrated economists in both parties are scrambling for a new playbook. Increasingly, they are looking away from grinding runs up the middle toward more freewheeling, long-yardage plays.
Among Democrats, that means greater government spending on education, infrastructure and even direct job creation. Among Republicans, it means far-reaching shifts in taxation and regulation. Those debates will help shape economic policy for the rest of President Obama's term and during the 2016 campaign.
The economy has finally emerged from the financial crisis and Great Recession of 2007-9. Employers added 314,000 jobs in November, and third-quarter output grew at a strong 5 percent annual rate with no signs of resurgent inflation.
But the generation-long stagnation of middle-class incomes continues.
From 1947 to 1979, the postwar economic boom more than doubled median family income to $58,573 in 2013 dollars. Had earnings growth kept that pace through the careers of baby boomers, median family income would have topped $124,000 by 2013. Instead, it was $63,815.
The magnitude of that lengthy slowdown makes many government policy responses look small. The Bush tax cuts saved a median-income family of four about $2,000 per year. If such a family contained one full-time worker making the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour, Mr. Obama's proposed wage hike to $10.10 would add about $6,000 a year.
In a competitive global economy, Democratic strategy starts with improved education and training to enhance workers' skills and productivity. Mr. Obama has unsuccessfully asked Congress to spend $75 billion more annually on early childhood education, but some allies advocate much more.
"My long bomb would be enacting a very large human capital strategy," said Austan Goolsbee, the University of Chicago professor who once chaired Mr. Obama's Council of Economic Advisers. For such a plan, Professor Goolsbee would allocate as much as 3 percent of gross domestic product, or more than $500 billion per year "across as many different dimensions as you could," from early education to community colleges to vocational training matching worker skills to employers' needs.
Yet, even in the best case scenario, big gains would take years. "If you think that's going to solve everything you're kidding yourself," said Jared Bernstein, the former chief economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.
In an era of Tea Party backlash against Washington, Mr. Bernstein backs the politically risky idea of direct government job creation to tighten labor markets, bid up wages, and enhance prospects for the long-term unemployed. Every $1 billion in government spending, a recent analysis concluded, would create 100,000 "subsidized jobs" paying $10 per hour for six months.
More Democrats support infrastructure spending to create short-term jobs and boost long-term economic potential with better seaports, airports and highways. Mr. Obama, unsuccessfully, has proposed $10 billion for a new "infrastructure bank" and another $22.5 billion annually in new highway spending.
Lawrence H. Summers, a former director of the National Economic Council, advocates something far grander: $200 billion annually in new public and private infrastructure spending for 10 years. He calculates that low borrowing costs mean the investment would produce handsome returns.
For Democrats especially, boosting economic growth represents only part of the solution. Another part is countering economic trends that have most benefited the highest-earning families.
Len Burman, director of the Tax Policy Center, offers one "radical" idea that would not cost a dime. Under current law, tax brackets rise each year to protect everyone from the effects of inflation. Mr. Burman would target those adjustments to people with stagnant incomes.
Reallocating inflation protections each year, projected to reach $200 billion by 2025, "would push gently against the winds of rising economic inequality," Mr. Burman wrote recently.
Richard Freeman, a Harvard labor economist, would push harder. In an economy producing big gains for businesses but not for workers, he proposes turning more workers into owners.
That would involve expanding incentives for workers to acquire stock in their employers, and for employers to offer workers incentive pay tied to the firm's profitability. "We presented some of these things to the Obama administration and the Wall Street guys just killed them," said Professor Freeman, a co-author of "The Citizen's Share: Putting Ownership Back into Democracy."
The Republican debate consists largely of getting government out of the way. Support by Jeb Bush, a prospective Republican presidential candidate, for Common Core educational standards cuts against the grain of his party.
In a recent manifesto by the conservative YG Network, Michael Strain proposed reducing occupational licensing for some industries, like cosmetology. James Pethokoukis, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute said shorter copyright terms for books, movies and other intellectual property would spur fresh innovation and job creation.
Others promote overhauling energy policy. Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office, backs capitalizing on this "most important economic event of the last decade" by lifting the longstanding ban on United States oil exports and relaxing restrictions on liquefied natural gas exports.
Others envision transformational effects from seizing on energy shifts to revamp the tax code. By moving away from taxing income toward taxing energy sources, said Steve Bell, a longtime Senate Republican aide now at the Bipartisan Policy Center, the United States could boost investment and growth, curb climate change and generate revenue to finance a currently insolvent entitlement system.
Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, proposes a new $2,500 tax credit for families with children. But the most popular conservative idea for boosting incomes is overhauling corporate taxation. Mr. Obama has embraced that goal if Congress closes enough loopholes while lowering the 35 percent top rate to ensure the government will not lose revenue.
Because loophole beneficiaries do not want to give them up, "revenue neutrality" makes cutting rates much harder. Casting off this constraint and simply lowering rates, said Kevin Hassett, an economist at A.E.I, would cause corporations to rapidly bring overseas jobs home.
"It would really help blue-collar workers," Mr. Hassett said. "This is not a Hail Mary. It's Tom Brady to Randy Moss."
Some Democrats dismiss his enthusiasm -- but not all of them. "An intriguing proposition," said Professor Freeman of Harvard.
To be sure, replicating America's postwar gains may prove impossible. "I don't think there are long passes," said Robert Reischauer, another former director of the Congressional Budget Office. "We're in a ground game that will take many years."

Full text:   I wish I knew where the economy will be heading next year. If I did, I might become rich. But, alas, I don't -- and even if we don't always acknowledge it, no economists do.
Too much uncertainty clouds the crystal ball to be confident that any particular course of events will play out in the real world. But we do know something about the sources of that uncertainty, and in a season for sharing, I'd like to offer six questions whose eventual resolution will shape the economic year ahead:
â-  How much slack really remains in the labor market?
The unemployment rate stands at 5.8 percent. If it continues on its current trajectory, it will have fallen an additional half a percentage point by mid-2015, putting it at a level that some economists see as effectively full employment.
Yet much of the reduction in unemployment reflects a decline in the share of the population in the work force. If a stronger economy were to induce these people to return to work, the recovery would still have a long way to run before we got to full employment. Moreover, millions of those who are counted as employed remain stuck in part-time jobs but want full-time work.
Further improvements in the labor market also depend on whether the long-term unemployed -- those who have been out of work six months or longer -- will successfully transition into new jobs. Pessimists emphasize that high levels of long-term unemployment proved to be an intractable problem through much of Europe over the last 40 years. Yet more recent evidence from the United States -- particularly from the early stages of this recovery -- makes me more optimistic that we can get the long-term jobless back to work.
All of this means we really don't know how far unemployment could fall without prompting inflation. Get ready for a debate premised on artificial precision about whether the economy can sustain unemployment of 5 or 5.5 percent. That's the consensus range. But the best research on this question suggests that the lowest sustainable rate could easily differ from our best estimates by a full percentage point or more. Indeed, the Clinton-era boom pushed unemployment below 4 percent without setting off an inflationary surge.
â-  Will the Federal Reserve treat its target for 2 percent inflation as a goal or a ceiling?
Officially, the Fed says it is as willing to tolerate the risk that inflation may rise above this level as it has been about inflation undershooting its goal over the last few years. Yet its actions suggest otherwise. Plans to normalize policy -- a euphemism for raising interest rates -- are already underway, even as the Fed's own projections suggest that inflation will not breach 2 percent in the next few years.
Higher interest rates could slow the economy. That leads to my third question:
â-  How fast does the economy need to grow to stay healthy?
Many commentators assume that a healthy economy grows at an annual rate of at least 3 percent. Yet economic growth in the United States has averaged only 1.9 percent since 2000, and average growth of 2.3 percent during the current expansion has been enough to yield large drops in unemployment. To an important extent, this lower rate has been caused by demographic factors: slower population growth, the end of the transition of women into the work force, and baby boomers retiring.
All told, the work force is growing nearly a full percentage point slower than it was in the 1990s, and this is why 2 percent growth is the new 3 percent. Likewise, much as the economy once needed to generate 150,000 jobs a month just to keep up with new entrants to the labor force, that "break-even" number may now be as low as 50,000.
â-  Can the American economy keep motoring without help from the rest of the world?
Among the world's major economies, the United States had the strongest economic growth in 2014. The picture elsewhere is grim. Japan has lurched from optimism about Abenomics -- Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's program to kick-start the economy -- to pessimism as the economy has shrunk over the last two quarters. And Europe hovers on the edge of a double- or triple-dip recession, depending on your definition. China has slowed, with economic growth moving below 8 percent a year from an extraordinary 10 percent. And the Russian economy is on the cusp of a full-fledged crisis. It's not just that foreign buyers have less money to spend; their weakness has become the dollar's strength, which also makes our exports more expensive. These global headwinds could easily knock a fragile recovery off course.
â-  What will be the consequences of lower oil prices, which have fallen by about half since June?
Typically, an oil price decline is like a tax cut, leaving more money in consumers' pockets to spend elsewhere. That should spur growth. But since the shale boom, the United States is not only a leading oil consumer but also a leading producer. So lower oil prices also spell smaller revenue for some of our energy companies. And our producers have particularly high costs, so further investment in them may become unprofitable if prices fall too far.
This leads us back to the inherent uncertainty afflicting economics:
â-  What, as Donald H. Rumsfeld, the former defense secretary, asked, are the unknown unknowns?
More often than not, the shocks that buffet the economy come out of the blue. Few predicted the huge swings in oil prices over recent years, and the same goes for the financial crisis and many other disruptive events. A few years ago, for example, the weakness in Greece's fiscal situation was successfully disguised, until it catalyzed the eurozone crisis. In 2011, the tsunami that brought huge damage to Japan also caused global economic tremors. And while we have often seen political gridlock in Congress, the extreme brinkmanship over financing the federal debt in recent years has been a form of economic self-sabotage that was once unimaginable.
I wish I could offer clearer guidance about next year, but an honest account focuses on the limits of our knowledge. We're not sure how much further the economy can improve next year, or even if it will actually do so, and we don't know what might drive it off course.
So instead of a forecast, I'll offer advice: Prepare for the worst, hope for the best and count on being surprised.

How Cheaper Oil Affects Rates

Abstract: In general, interest rates tend to be very sensitive to inflation. Because cheaper oil lowers costs throughout the American economy, inflation is pulled downward as well, said Keith Gumbinger, the vice president of HSH.com, a financial publisher.

Full text:   Falling oil prices typically lead to lower heating bills and cheaper fill-ups at the gasoline pump. Less obvious to the average consumer is the role cheaper oil is playing in driving down mortgage rates.
It is a complicated and indirect link that will likely keep rates low well into 2015, economists say.
Average fixed mortgage rates dropped this month to their lowest levels of the year, according to Freddie Mac. As of Dec. 18, the agency's weekly mortgage survey showed the 30-year fixed-rate national average was 3.80 percent with an average of 0.6 point. (A point is a fee equal to 1 percent of the loan amount.) The national average for the 15-year fixed-rate loan was 3.09 percent, also with an average of 0.6 point.
Mortgage rates are largely driven by the bond markets and most closely follow the yields (or rates of return) on United States Treasuries. The Freddie Mac survey noted that the bottoming out of average fixed rates earlier this month followed the lowest yields on 10-year Treasuries since May 2013.
So why the decline in yields? The answer, at least in part, has to do with the prolonged slump in oil prices. The price of Brent crude, a benchmark for international prices, which peaked at $115 a barrel in mid-June, has been trading in the $60 range.
In general, interest rates tend to be very sensitive to inflation. Because cheaper oil lowers costs throughout the American economy, inflation is pulled downward as well, said Keith Gumbinger, the vice president of HSH.com, a financial publisher. In turn, lower inflation can allow for interest rates in general to decline.
That effect has been exacerbated of late by global investors' concerns about the ailing economies in oil-producing countries, especially Russia. If low oil prices are a boon for consuming nations, they can be detrimental to the economies of producing nations, Mr. Gumbinger said.
"Markets that would normally be pumping oil and getting dollars will get far fewer dollars -- and the prospects for those countries are lower," he said.
The United States, in contrast, with its strong dollar and strengthening economy, looks like a far safer bet for global investors, said Nela Richardson, the chief economist for Redfin, a national real estate brokerage. And many of them are seeking shelter in United States Treasuries.
"Investor demand is chasing that strong dollar into U.S. bonds, and those investors are requiring less yield," Ms. Richardson said. "And as investors require less yield to invest in those bonds, it also decreases mortgage rates."
How long low oil prices will help support low mortgage rates is anybody's guess. For one thing, nobody really knows when oil prices will turn around and go the other way, Mr. Gumbinger said. But sustained low-level energy prices also could eventually have a counter effect on interest rates, he said, "by adding hundreds of billions of dollars" to consumer spending.
Rates could begin to creep up if the economy continues to strengthen, Ms. Richardson said. "If firms start hiring again, and wages increase -- that's when the level of all interest rates in the U.S. would increase," she said.
And then there's the role of the Federal Reserve. Janet L. Yellen, the Fed's chairwoman, recently said that the central bank expects to raise interest rates in 2015, sometime after late April. But Ms. Richardson predicts that global concerns will exert far more influence over interest rates than the Fed, which could mean mortgage rates will stay well below 5 percent for yet another year.
The takeaway for home buyers, Ms. Richardson added, is "there's not a lot of urgency."

Full text:   LONDON -- Share prices went through the roof, speculation ran wild and money poured into ill-fated ventures before the boom turned, inevitably and catastrophically, to bust.
After that financial crash in 1720, called the South Sea Bubble, the British government was forced to undertake a bailout that eventually left several million pounds of debt on its books. Almost three centuries later, Britons are still paying interest on a small part of that obligation.
Now, prompted by record low interest rates, the British government is planning to pay off some of the debts it racked up over hundreds of years, dating as far back as the South Sea Bubble.
George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, said this month that in 2015 Britain would repay part of the country's debt from World War I, and that he wanted to pay off other bonds for debt incurred in the 18th and 19th centuries.
That includes borrowing that may have been used to compensate slave owners when slavery was abolished, to relieve the famine in 19th-century Ireland and to bail out the infamous South Sea Company, which caused the bubble in 1720.
Economically, the move is no different from a homeowner's decision to refinance a mortgage at a lower rate. In an era when the government can borrow at 1.5 percent or less, paying out to holders of historic debt anything from 2.5 to 4 percent per year, as it is now, makes little sense.
But the maneuver is also a reminder of how debts incurred by governments are passed down through generations.
In many cases, the underlying debt has already been refinanced, sometimes multiple times, since being incurred. The bonds paying interest on the debt have been bought and sold and passed down through generations, still paying interest indefinitely, until the government decides to pay them off. So old are some of the bonds that closing the books on them may require an act of Parliament in some cases.
Gary Shea, head of the school of economics and finance at the University of St. Andrews, said historic debt is "real," even if the vast majority of public borrowing is fairly recent. "The taxpayer is still financing the interest payments on it," he said.
One of the bonds Mr. Osborne plans to pay back next year is a 3.5 percent war loan issued in 1932 in exchange for earlier bonds. It still has more than 120,000 holders, including 38,000 who own bonds with a face value of less than £100, or about $155. In March, those who still own the bonds will get the original stake back at a cost to the government of £1.9 billion.
Also set for repayment are "4 percent consols," or securities, issued in 1927 by Winston Churchill, then chancellor of the Exchequer, partly to refinance National War Bonds originating from World War I. Now worth £218 million, they will be repaid in February.
Reissuing bonds was a big administrative endeavor in earlier eras. In 1932, the conversion of an earlier war loan to one paying lower interest required so many temporary clerks that 700 lambs were prepared to feed them one evening, according to a history of Britain's debt by Jeremy Wormell. Now, in the computer age, the task is relatively straightforward, officials say.
Within a total debt of around £1.4 trillion, the historic liability accounts for a small portion -- about £2.5 billion, or less than two-tenths of 1 percent of the total outstanding.
But over the centuries, Britain's borrowing has at times been huge and has come in different forms, sometimes including loans from other governments.
It was not until 2006, for example, that Britain fully repaid its lend-lease debts to the United States from World War II.
Some international loans from the aftermath of World War I were never fully paid and were effectively put aside in 1934, though Britain also failed to recoup debts it was owed by other nations.
The recent eurozone debt crisis is creating a similar legacy in countries that took bailout loans. Ireland is not scheduled to make its final repayment to international creditors until 2042. Greece is scheduled to do the same in 2054.
Britain's current stock of open-ended historical debts does not include international loans but is made up of a variety of bonds known as gilts, a name that comes from the original British government certificates that had gilded edges.
Of course, much of the original debt has been eroded by inflation. According to research for the British Parliament, prices rose by around 118 times from 1750 to 1998.
The debt originating in part from the South Sea Bubble, the oldest still on the books, was consolidated into bonds issued in 1853, and those who now own them receive an annual payout of 2.5 percent.
According to the Bank of England, that original debt of around £4 million was probably incurred around 1722, though other sources suggested it might date from a few years later.
Experts say that some of the government bonds issued in the years after 1720 were created to replace earlier ones that had paid higher interest -- a principle that Mr. Osborne is following three centuries later.
"We are now in a period," said Mr. Shea of the University of St. Andrews, "in which interest rates are even lower than they were in the 18th century."

Full text:   SÃO LUÍS, Brazil -- The tribute is lavish. Slip into the Convento das Mercês, an elegantly restored colonial gem built here in 1654, and learn of the feats of José Sarney, a former president of Brazil and chief of the political dynasty that has held sway over the vast northeast state of Maranhão for five decades.
A documentary depicts Mr. Sarney as a generously mustachioed governor lifting Maranhão ( pronounced mar-ah-NEEOW) from its economic isolation in the 1960s. Photos capture him presiding over Brazil's transition to civilian rule in the 1980s. A display of titles, including "Master of the Sea," show his literary prowess as a novelist-statesman.
Outside the Convento das Mercês, which houses a state-financed foundation heralding Mr. Sarney, residents are quick to point out the family's mark all around São Luís, the state capital.
Need a place to live? Consider the neighborhood of Vila Sarney, they joke. A hospital? There is the Maternidade Marly Sarney. Want to check out a book? Try the José Sarney Library. Need to go to the old center? Take the José Sarney Bridge.
And if you have a problem, you can always file a lawsuit -- at the Sarney Costa Courthouse.
But all the visible celebration of Mr. Sarney now stands in sharp contrast to the way the patriarch, 84, and his offspring are widely perceived both in Maranhão, one of Brazil's poorest states, and the rest of Brazil.
Voters ousted Mr. Sarney's political loyalists in Maranhão in state elections in October, and Mr. Sarney, long one of Brazil's most powerful men from his perch in the Senate, announced that he would not seek re-election, possibly opening the way for one of the more profound shifts in Brazilian politics in recent years.
"The last great colonels of Brazil are finally in decline," said Rodrigo Lago, a lawyer and transparency activist, using the term for the strongmen asserting power over big areas of Brazil, largely here in the nation's poor northeast.
"If Maranhão can change, then oligarchies elsewhere can be curbed in this country," he added.
Powerful dynasties elsewhere in Brazil are showing signs of strain. In Paraíba, another northeast state, the son of Ronaldo Cunha Lima, a former governor who infamously shot his predecessor in a crowded restaurant in 1993 without ever serving time for attempted murder, lost a bid for governor this year.
Similarly, voters recently thwarted the son of Jader Barbalho -- a powerful senator with a regional media empire who has long battled corruption charges -- from being elected governor of Pará, the huge state in the Amazon bordering Maranhão.
Of course, powerful political families are resilient, and dynasties can always mount a comeback. In Alagoas, one of Brazil's poorest states, the 34-year-old son of Renan Calheiros, the president of Brazil's Senate, was elected governor in October.
While President Dilma Rousseff is from the leftist Workers Party, she has little choice but to forge alliances with centrist or conservative parties, some led by old-school political chiefs.
But here in the Sarney bastion of Maranhão, many people are sanguine about the chances of finally turning a corner.
"We're done with the Sarneys, who stayed in power just to enrich themselves," said Sueli Celeste, 48, the secretary at a school near the Convento das Mercês in the old center of São Luís, which abounds in one derelict palazzo after another.
"Hide your phone when you walk around here," she added. "The crack addicts will steal it if they see you taking pictures."
The roots of resentment are not hard to see. Maranhão remains one of Brazil's poorest states, with many of its people eking out an existence as subsistence farmers.
Yet the Sarney family has managed to assemble a powerful collection of mass media holdings, including the newspaper O Estado de Maranhão and TV Mirante, an affiliate of the Globo television network, enabling the clan to celebrate its achievements and attack its critics.
"The media constantly extol the great things Sarney and his allies have done and are doing," said Sean Mitchell, an anthropologist at Rutgers University who has conducted extensive research in Maranhão. "Despite this, the provision of public services by the Sarney family and allied officeholders is terrible."
Maranhão ranks second to last among Brazil's 26 states in the United Nations Human Development Index, a comprehensive measure of factors like education levels, incomes and life expectancy.
Writing this year in his Sunday column in O Estado de Maranhão, the Sarney family's newspaper, Mr. Sarney argued that the development index was created as a strategy by "imperialist countries" to exploit weaknesses in the developing world.
"This is the index they crow about when they want to talk bad about Brazil and worse about Maranhão," he said. (The index was actually created by a Nobel laureate from India and a former finance minister of Pakistan).
Flávio Dino, a former judge and member of the Communist Party of Brazil, glided to victory in the governor's race in October against the candidate allied with the Sarney family by campaigning on a platform of raising living standards.
Mr. Sarney was born in a town in the interior of Maranhão in 1930 as José Ribamar Ferreira de Araújo Costa. He took his father's foreign-sounding first name, Sarney, made it into a surname and began a political career with few parallels in Brazil.
A supporter of a coup in 1964 that ushered in a military dictatorship, he thrived during authoritarian rule before emerging in 1984 as the running mate of Tancredo Neves, the leader of Brazil's restoration of democracy. Elected president in 1985, Mr. Neves died of complications from intestinal surgery before taking office, opening the way for Mr. Sarney's rise to power.
Mr. Sarney, whose aides said he was unavailable for an interview, left office in 1990 with an approval rating of just 14 percent amid scathing criticism over management of the economy. At the time, Brazil grappled with an annual inflation rate of 1,765 percent.
Then Mr. Sarney reinvented himself as a senator representing Amapá, a territory in the Amazon made into a state in 1991, overseeing the growth of the family's media empire and the entrance of his children into politics. He rose to prominence again over the last decade as a president of the Senate, while battling claims of nepotism and corruption.
His daughter, Roseana, the departing governor of Maranhão, is celebrated in the pages of the family newspaper (a front-page photograph in November showed her strumming a guitar while visiting a school). But her last year in office was hit by a crisis over prison uprisings involving decapitations and reports that gangs were raping inmates' wives during conjugal visits.
Citing personal reasons, Ms. Sarney stepped down this month with only weeks left in her latest term, avoiding the ceremony of transferring the governor's sash to her successor on Jan. 1. Meanwhile, testimony in a huge bribery scandal involving the national oil company has linked her to the scheme. Ms. Sarney, who has denied the claims, also declined a request for an interview.
Some in Maranhão doubt that the Sarney family will now sit back and simply watch its opponents wield power. In fact, Ms. Sarney was knocked out of the governor's palace once before, after the election of an opposition governor in 2006.
But he was ousted in the face of criticism in Sarney-controlled news media over vote-buying accusations, enabling Ms. Sarney to step in and replace him.
Her father, the family patriarch, remains defiant even at the end of his long political career. Writing in his Sunday column about the "new Maranhão," Mr. Sarney said the state resembled "a body without a head" before he became governor in the 1960s.
"Today's generation has no notion of that struggle; the largest victory of all was changing the mentality of Maranhão," Mr. Sarney said. "It was so strong that it produced a president of the republic, and Maranhão emerged as one of the most important states in the country."

Full text:   BRUSSELS -- A plunge in oil prices has sent tremors through the global political and economic order, setting off an abrupt shift in fortunes that has bolstered the interests of the United States and pushed several big oil-exporting nations -- particularly those hostile to the West, like Russia, Iran and Venezuela -- to the brink of financial crisis.
The nearly 50 percent decline in oil prices since June has had the most conspicuous impact on the Russian economy and President Vladimir V. Putin. The former finance minister Aleksei L. Kudrin, a longtime friend of Mr. Putin's, warned this week of a "full-blown economic crisis" and called for better relations with Europe and the United States.
But the ripple effects are spreading much more broadly than that. The price plunge may also influence Iran's deliberations over whether to agree to a deal on its nuclear program with the West; force the oil-rich nations of the Middle East to reassess their role in managing global supply; and give a boost to the economies of the biggest oil-consuming nations, notably the United States and China.
It might even have been a late factor in Cuba's decision to seal a rapprochement with Washington.
After a precipitous drop, to less than $60 a barrel from around $115 a barrel in June, oil prices settled at a low level this week. Their fall, even if partly reversed, was so sharp and so quick as to unsettle plans and assumptions in many governments. That includes Mr. Putin's apparent hope that Russia could weather Western sanctions over its intervention in Ukraine without serious economic harm, and Venezuela's aspirations for continuing the free-spending policies of former President Hugo Chávez.
The price drop, said Edward N. Luttwak, a longtime Pentagon adviser and author of several books on geopolitical and economic strategy, "is knocking down America's principal opponents without us even trying." For Iran, which is estimated to be losing $1 billion a month because of the fall, it is as if Congress had passed the much tougher sanctions that the White House lobbied against, he said.
Iran has been hit so hard that its government, looking for ways to fill a widening hole in its budget, is offering young men the option of buying their way out of an obligatory two years of military service. "We are on the eve of a major crisis," an Iranian economist, Hossein Raghfar, told the Etemaad newspaper on Sunday. "The government needs money badly."
Venezuela, which has the world's largest estimated oil reserves and has used them to position itself as a foil to American "imperialism," received 95 percent of its export earnings from petroleum before prices fell. It is now having trouble paying for social projects at home and for a foreign policy rooted in oil-financed largess, including shipments of reduced-price petroleum to Cuba and elsewhere.
Amid worries on bond markets that Venezuela might default on its loans, President Nicolás Maduro, who was elected last year after the death of Mr. Chávez, has said the country will continue to pay its debts. But inflation in Venezuela is over 60 percent, there are shortages of many basic goods, and many experts believe the economy is in recession.
But the biggest casualty so far has probably been Russia, where energy revenue accounts for more than half of the government's budget. Mr. Putin built up strong support by seeming to banish the economic turmoil that had afflicted the rule of his predecessor, Boris N. Yeltsin. Yet Russia was back on its heels last week, with the ruble going into such a steep dive that panicked Russians thronged shops to spend what they had.
"We've seen this movie before," said Strobe Talbott, who was President Bill Clinton's senior Russia adviser in the aftermath of the Soviet Union's 1991 collapse and is now president of the Brookings Institution in Washington.
Russia's troubles have rippled around the world, slashing bookings at ski resorts in Austria and spending on London real estate; spreading panic in neighboring Belarus, a close Russian ally; and even threatening to upend Russia's Kontinental Hockey League, which pays players in rubles.
"It is a big boost for the U.S. when three out of four of our active antagonists are seriously weakened, when their room for maneuver is seriously reduced," Mr. Luttwak said, referring to Russia, Iran and Venezuela.
The only major United States antagonist not hurt by the drop in oil prices is North Korea, which imports all of its petroleum.
David L. Goldwyn, who was the State Department's international energy coordinator during President Obama's first term, warned that an implosion of Venezuela's economy could hurt the Caribbean and Latin America in ways that the United States would not welcome.
But "on balance, it's positive for the U.S.," he said of the low price of oil, because American consumers save money, and "it harms Russia and puts pressure on Iran."
Even some of the indirect consequences of the price slump, like last week's break in the half-century diplomatic logjam between Washington and Havana, have generally worked in the United States' favor. Fearful that Venezuela, its main benefactor, might cut off supplies of cash and cheap oil, Cuba sealed a historic deal that has in turn lifted a shadow over the United States' standing in much of Latin America.
Another casualty of the price collapse has been Belarus, a former Soviet territory long reviled by American officials as Europe's last dictatorship. It produces no significant amount of crude oil itself but has nonetheless taken a big hit. This is because its economy depends heavily on the export of petroleum products that Belarus produces using crude oil supplied, at a steep discount, by Russia.
Marwan Muasher, a former foreign minister of Jordan who is now a vice president at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, predicted another domino effect in Syria as Russia and Iran find it difficult to sustain their economic, military and diplomatic support for President Bashar al-Assad.
Others speculate that Persian Gulf oil producers, though still wealthy, might trim their financial support for radical Islamist rebel groups in Syria.
Mr. Muasher said the drop in oil prices could also prod Middle East oil producers toward political and economic change by challenging so-called rentier systems in which governments derive much of their income from rents paid by foreigners for resources. "Whatever the case, it is clear that the effect of the new oil price levels will not be limited to the economic sphere," he wrote in a Carnegie report.
Hard-hit anti-American oil producers have blamed foreign machinations for their woes, suggesting that Washington, in cahoots with Saudi Arabia, has deliberately driven down prices.
This view is particularly strong in Russia, where former K.G.B. agents close to Mr. Putin have long believed that Washington engineered the collapse of the Soviet Union by getting Saudi Arabia to increase oil output, driving down prices and thus starving Moscow of revenue.
In many ways, the recent price fall really is the United States' work, flowing to a large extent from a surge in American oil production through the development of alternative sources like shale.
By offsetting declines in conventional oil production, increases in shale oil output have allowed overall American crude oil production to rise to an average of about nine million barrels a day from five million a day in 2008, according to the United States Energy Information Administration. That four-million-barrel increase is more than either Iraq or Iran, the second- and third-largest OPEC producers after Saudi Arabia, produces each day, and it has put strong downward pressure on world prices.
The geopolitical shakeout set off by the oil market has not gone entirely America's way. Russia's troubles have so far shown no sign of pushing Mr. Putin toward a more conciliatory position on Ukraine, and some analysts believe they could make Moscow even more pugnacious and prone to lashing out.
The Bank of England's Financial Policy Committee, which monitors possible systemic threats, warned in minutes released this week that "sustained lower oil price also had the potential to reinforce certain geopolitical risks." It voiced alarm, too, over an increased risk of deflation in the eurozone, the 18-nation area that uses Europe's common currency.
The price drop could also encourage more freewheeling use of oil products like gasoline, undermining what appears to be a growing consensus among nations that carbon emissions must be reeled in to offset the most dire effects of global warming.
While authoritarian oil producers like Russia are clearly suffering, China is enjoying a huge windfall thanks to the price drop. It imports nearly 60 percent of the oil it needs to power its economy.
China became the world's largest importer of oil in 2013, surpassing the United States, and so stands to benefit from plummeting prices. Bank of America Merrill Lynch estimated last month that every 10 percent decline in the price of oil could increase China's economic growth by 0.15 percent.
Strong growth in China would lift demand for oil and help reduce the current agonies of OPEC, which pumps around a third of the world's oil but, largely as a result of increased American production, has lost much of its ability to dictate prices by controlling output.
In an interview with the Middle East Economic Survey this week, the Saudi energy minister, Ali al-Naimi, indicated a fundamental rethinking by OPEC, saying that it needed to focus on keeping its market share rather than trying to raise prices by slashing production. "We have entered a scary time for the oil market," he said.

Abstract: Since 1990, the share of residents of Georgia, Tennessee and the Carolinas who were born in California has roughly doubled, according to a New York Times analysis of census data. Cecilia Eifert, a California native who lives in Peachtree City, an Atlanta suburb, largely because her husband works for Delta Air Lines, estimates that their current house would sell for less than $1 million -- but more than $2 million in Southern California.

Full text:   The adopted Southerners have landed this week in San Francisco and Los Angeles, in New York, Chicago and Denver. It is the new pattern in holiday travel: Thousands of people raised in California, the Midwest or the Northeast will return, albeit temporarily, from their homes in Atlanta, Memphis or Raleigh.
It wasn't so long ago that the holiday exodus went in the other direction, and the reversal highlights a basic change in American culture. The Southeast has replaced California as the place where many people now go to find the American dream.
"You have the feeling that you perhaps might be a little more successful here than if you stayed in Southern California," said Laura Voisin George, 52, an architectural historian in the Atlanta area. She is enough of a Californian to be planning to volunteer, again, at the Rose Parade in Pasadena this New Year's Day -- but not enough of one to live there anymore.
Since 1990, the share of residents of Georgia, Tennessee and the Carolinas who were born in California has roughly doubled, according to a New York Times analysis of census data. The number of Oregon, Washington and Colorado natives -- as well as natives of Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York -- in the Southeast has surged, too.
These migrants are crowding into airports this week, including Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport in Atlanta, the world's busiest airport. And when they are back in their old hometowns, many will end up singing the praises of their new ones, potentially recruiting new migrants in the process.
"I love California -- I love California," said Christoph Guttentag, a San Francisco Bay Area native and dean of undergraduate admissions at Duke University, where he has been since 1992. "But the prices are too high, and the commutes are too long."
In 2012, 2.2 million -- or 8 percent -- of people who were born in California lived in one of the 16 states that the census defines as the South, according to the analysis. In 1990, the share was only 5.7 percent, and in 1960 it was 3 percent.
>
At the same time, the Southeast now sends fewer of its own natives to California and some other states.
"In the Depression and World War II, you had people leaving the South in very large numbers," said Jeffrey Passel, a senior demographer at the Pew Research Center. "That's reversed."
The main reason is a version of what economists call arbitrage: Growing numbers of people have realized that many of life's biggest costs -- including housing, energy and taxes -- are lower in the South, said Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics, which specializes in regional economic data.
House prices, for example, were already lower in the Southeast in the early 1990s than in much of California and the Northeast -- and the gap has widened significantly since.
House prices in the Atlanta and Charlotte regions have actually risen slightly less than economywide inflation since 1991, according to the S.&P./Case-Shiller Home Price Index. In the Los Angeles area, by comparison, the inflation-adjusted price of housing has risen 31 percent over the same period. The increase has been 32 percent in New York and 50 percent in both Boston and San Francisco.
Of course, those increases reflect the enormous appeal that the Northeast and California continue to have, as the country's economic, political and cultural centers. Yet living in their most desirable areas has come to be something of a luxury good.
With incomes growing only slowly for many American households over the last 15 years, the South has taken on a greater middle-class appeal. That the region has been more aggressive about building new homes plays a role in its affordability. It has expanded its housing stock more rapidly than other regions, avoiding a sharp run-up in housing costs.
Mr. Guttentag, Duke's admissions dean, remembers the "sobering observation" he had years ago: "I could not afford to buy the house I grew up in."
Cecilia Eifert, a California native who lives in Peachtree City, an Atlanta suburb, largely because her husband works for Delta Air Lines, estimates that their current house would sell for less than $1 million -- but more than $2 million in Southern California. "What you can get in California versus what you can get here, oh my gosh, it's night and day," she said.
Ms. Eifert does share two common complaints of many of the new Southerners: the lack of scenic beauty, at least compared to California, and the lack of transportation options.
Atlanta has among the worst traffic in the country, but unlike many of the other regions with packed roads -- Boston, New York, San Francisco, Washington -- Atlanta has a weak mass-transit system. Even Los Angeles, with its notorious traffic, is expanding public transportation.
The absence of good train and bus options across much of the South is a flip side of its lower taxes. Many areas lack the money to expand or repair mass transit.
Whatever the drawbacks, many of the Southern migrants say they are happy with their move. In particular, they say that places like Atlanta, Nashville and the Greenville area of South Carolina still have their original advantages -- lower cost of living and slower pace of life -- but have also become more cosmopolitan. The options for good food, music and art, among other things, have blossomed.
For better or worse, depending on your views, the migration patterns have also begun to change politics. The Democrats' miserable showing in 2014 notwithstanding, the party now wins a substantial number of votes in Georgia and North Carolina -- not to mention Florida and Virginia -- from natives of the Northeast and the West.
Years ago, Mr. Guttentag was eating dinner back in California with friends, and they could not understand why he had chosen to make his life in North Carolina. To them, the South seemed "exotic and not well understood and slightly mistrusted," he said. "Now, you talk to people and, they say, 'Yeah, I know someone who moved there."'
As an admissions officer, Mr. Guttentag has also participated in one of the causes of the trend: the nationalization of the college-admissions market. The number of high-school students at Duke from California has roughly doubled since the early 1990s, and other Southern colleges also attract more students from outside the region than in the past. A fair number of those students end up staying after graduation.
Over all, more than 40 percent of North Carolina residents in 2012 were born in another state; a generation ago, it was less than 25 percent. Similar increases have occurred in Georgia, South Carolina and Tennessee. And the increases often have a self-sustaining nature to them.
James and Sarah Terry -- who both teach at colleges in the Atlanta area and have two small children -- miss much about their life out West. "You might have said we left Seattle kicking and screaming," said Mr. Terry, in an interview from Napa, Calif., where the Terry family is for the holidays. She added, "We were just really sad to leave."
Yet they were able to buy a house in Atlanta, and the weather lets them have a garden. They have no immediate plans to leave.
"Sarah's parents have been talking about moving to Atlanta if we end up staying there long term," Mr. Terry said. "Maybe if the younger crowd sticks around, their parents will retire there and you'll have more permanent families."

Full text:   LOS ANGELES -- The delay of major movies from Pixar and Universal. The pirating of "The Expendables 3" and "Annie" before their release. Warner Bros. suffering one dud after another. Hackers forcing the cancellation of a big Sony comedy.
Hollywood does not want a sequel to 2014.
For the year, ticket sales at North American theaters will total roughly $10.5 billion, a 4 percent decline from a year earlier, according to projections by the box-office data firm Rentrak. Attendance will drop by about the same percentage.
Annual fluctuations of that size are not uncommon at the domestic box office, which rises and falls based on the strength of the movie lineup. Still, that total would give the movie business its lowest tally since 2000, after accounting for inflation.
Despite some major successes -- "Guardians of the Galaxy," "The Lego Movie," "Godzilla," "Divergent," "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" and "The Maze Runner" all revived franchises or started new ones -- box-office weakness stretched into nearly every genre and audience segment. There was no big-budget catastrophe like "The Lone Ranger," but at least a dozen films underperformed in domestic theaters, suggesting structural weakness, analysts said.
Expensive films like "The Amazing Spider-Man 2" and "The Hunger Games: Mockingjay, Part 1" missed their box-office mark. So did midbudget comedies, including "Muppets Most Wanted," "A Million Ways to Die in the West," "Sex Tape" and "Horrible Bosses 2." Once-reliable animated films hit a rough patch in 2014, as releases like "Penguins of Madagascar" and "Planes: Fire and Rescue" disappointed.
No arty drama was poised to match the kind of breakout status reached in recent years by "Black Swan" or "Lincoln."
Hollywood's primary worry is that moviegoing in North America is changing along generational lines. In particular, young ticket buyers traditionally turned out weekend after weekend -- with the quality of the films mattering less than the opportunity to fraternize. But this group is staying home more often. Reasons include video games, YouTube, smartphone preoccupation and ever-increasing on-demand film alternatives.
The Nielsen Company said this month that the moviegoing of Americans age 12 to 24 dropped 15 percent in the first nine months of 2014, compared with the same period a year earlier.
Female ticket buyers added financial sizzle to movies like "Maleficent," "The Fault in Our Stars" and "Lucy." But studios as a whole remain laser-focused on testosterone-fueled action extravaganzas because those pictures are the ones being gobbled in growing overseas markets.
Paul Dergarabedian, a senior Rentrak analyst, said it was a series of unfortunate events that cumulatively resulted in an off year for the industry.
"Studios and theater owners just couldn't catch a break, with lots of little things adding up," Mr. Dergarabedian said.
And some big things: Christmas is typically one of the busiest times of the year for Hollywood, but movie executives are worried that some consumers will stay home because of a recent terror threat to theaters.
Last week, hackers threatened violence against any theater showing "The Interview," a $44 million Sony comedy about the assassination of the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un. When the vast majority of the country's theaters backed out of playing the movie, Sony canceled all release plans, at least for now.
Weekend ticket sales at North American theaters gave studios mixed messages about consumer confidence.
"The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies" from Warner and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer took in $56.2 million over the weekend, for a strong total since opening on Wednesday of $90.6 million -- slightly better than the five-day total for last year's "Hobbit" installment.
But "Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb" and "Annie" both opened to so-so results, and total weekend ticket sales dropped nearly 6 percent compared to the same three days last year.
"It's been a rather sluggish market since Thanksgiving," said Chris Aronson, president of domestic distribution for 20th Century Fox.
Fox had a better year than its competitors. Powered by hits like "X-Men: Days of Future Past," "Dawn of the Planet of the Apes" and "Gone Girl," Fox will end 2014 as Hollywood's No. 1 studio based on domestic box-office market share, according to the data company Box Office Mojo.
For the year, the No. 1 movie in the United States and Canada was Disney-Marvel's "Guardians of the Galaxy," which took in $332.6 million, for a global total of $772.2 million. The second-biggest draw was "The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1," a Lionsgate film that has so far generated $289.2 million ($639.7 million globally).
Disney-Marvel's "Captain America: The Winter Soldier" was third, taking in $259.8 million ($714.1 million globally). The biggest film on a global scale was Paramount's "Transformers: Age of Extinction," with $1.1 billion in ticket sales.
On the opposite end of the scale, Sony's year was difficult even before it was attacked by hackers, although its "22 Jump Street" and "Heaven Is for Real" were standouts. And Warner, until recently Hollywood's strongest movie operation, slumped badly, with hits like "The Lego Movie" and "Annabelle" offset by a string of clunkers.
Studio executives and theater owners primarily attributed the overall decline in ticket sales to the delay of several would-be blockbusters. The seventh installment in Universal's "Fast and Furious" series was pushed back after the death of one of its lead actors. Warner rescheduled "Jupiter Ascending." Pixar, for the first time in nine years, did not release a movie, sending "The Good Dinosaur" back to the drawing board.
"We were missing a couple of big movies, and it hurt," said Gerardo I. Lopez, the chief executive of AMC Theatres.
Whenever ticket sales take a tumble, Hollywood pulls the assertion of cyclicality out of its hip pocket: Just wait until next year -- next year will be our best ever.
In the case of 2015, it might be true. Coming are expected box-office monsters like "Star Wars: Episode VII -- The Force Awakens," "Jurassic World," "Furious 7," "Avengers: Age of Ultron," "Fifty Shades of Grey," the James Bond film "Spectre" and animated entries like "Minions" and Pixar's "Inside Out."
"North America should be able to break through the $11 billion barrier next year," Mr. Lopez said. "That's an easy green given what's coming. We should be able to hit it, even though we're a lot of yards out."

Full text:   Sometimes, decisions that shape the world's economic future are made with great pomp and gain widespread attention. Other times, they are made through a quick, unanimous vote by members of the New Zealand Parliament who were eager to get home for Christmas.
That is what happened 25 years ago this Sunday, when New Zealand became the first country to set a formal target for how much prices should rise each year -- zero to 2 percent in its initial action. The practice was so successful in making the high inflation of the 1970s and '80s a thing of the past that all of the world's most advanced nations have emulated it in one form or another. A 2 percent inflation target is now the norm across much of the world, having become virtually an economic religion.
A core piece of the Japanese government's strategy to jolt its economy to life is to do "whatever it takes" to get to that magical 2 percent inflation level. In the United States, the same rationale has driven the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates near zero for six years and to pump nearly $4 trillion into the economy by buying bonds. The European Central Bank appears on the verge of its own huge effort to bring inflation closer to 2 percent.
Yet even as the idea of a 2 percent target has become the orthodoxy, a worrying possibility is becoming clear: What if it's wrong? What if it is one of the reasons that the global economy has been locked in five years of slow growth?
Some economists are beginning to consider the possibility that 2 percent inflation at all times leaves central banks with too little flexibility to adequately fight a deep economic malaise.
To understand that thinking, it's worth understanding how New Zealand's 2 percent target became so entrenched in the world economic order to begin with. The story starts in that Southern Hemisphere nation in the summer of 1989, with a kiwi farmer and banker named Don Brash.
When Mr. Brash stepped down as managing director of the New Zealand Kiwifruit Authority to lead the country's central bank in 1988, he was taking the helm of an economy that had been through a rough two decades, with high inflation and disappointing growth.
Mr. Brash tells the story of an uncle who sold an apple orchard in 1971 and put the money into long-term government bonds to finance his retirement, only to see inflation wipe out 90 percent of his life savings by the time the bonds matured.
In the years before Mr. Brash took the helm of the central bank -- the Reserve Bank of New Zealand -- his predecessor had made progress in bringing down inflation and making the bank more independent from the whims of politicians. But that independence had not been codified in law.
That's what the Reserve Bank Act of 1989 was supposed to do. It directed the finance minister and the head of the central bank to arrive at a formal target for how high inflation should be, and granted the central bank political independence to guide interest rates to achieve that inflation level. The head of the central bank could be dismissed for failure to reach the inflation goal.
For David Caygill, New Zealand's finance minister at the time, the essential part of the law was establishing the bank's independence from the political process. "Inflation targeting wasn't from our point of view the main point of the act," he said in an interview this month.
The debate over the legislation was contentious. Labor unions feared that focusing so pointedly on inflation would lead to higher unemployment. Some business interests agreed. "This is wrong in principle, undemocratic and inflexible," the New Zealand Manufacturers' Federation said in a statement in July 1989.
Mr. Brash wrote in his memoir that one prominent real estate developer "called publicly for me to announce my body weight, so that he could work out how much rope would be needed to hang me from a lamppost in Lambton Quay," referring to the downtown area of Wellington, New Zealand's capital.
Ultimately, however, the leaders of the majority party in Parliament decided to brush off the concerns. It helped the cause that one of the bill's strongest opponents was laid up in the hospital. And Christmas was around the corner.
Once the law was enacted, though, there was the difficult question of what the inflation target should be. Zero percent? Two percent? Five percent?
Mr. Brash and Mr. Caygill got a head start on an answer from an offhand comment made during a television interview in 1988. Roger Douglas, Mr. Caygill's predecessor as finance minister, had been seeking to dissuade New Zealanders from thinking that the central bank would be content with high inflation, and so he said in an interview that he was aiming for inflation of around zero to 1 percent.
"It was almost a chance remark," Mr. Brash said in a recent interview. "The figure was plucked out of the air to influence the public's expectations."
With Mr. Douglas's figures as a starting point, Mr. Brash and Mr. Caygill agreed that it would be best to expand the range to give them more room to maneuver, but only a bit. New Zealand would aim for inflation between zero and 2 percent.
Not surprisingly, the passage of a law to reform the central bank governance of an archipelago of 3.4 million people received no coverage in the major American papers. But across the close-knit world of global central bankers, people started to notice the Kiwis' monetary policy experiment.
At the time, the idea of a central bank simply announcing how much inflation it was aiming for was an almost radical idea. After all, central bankers had long considered a certain man-behind-the-curtain mystique as one of their tools of power.
The inflation goal may have reduced that mystique, but it created a kind of magic of its own. Merely by announcing its goals for inflation, and giving the central bank the independent authority to reach that goal, New Zealand made that result a reality. In negotiations over wages or making plans for price increases, businesses and labor unions across New Zealand started assuming that inflation would indeed be around 2 percent. It thus became self-fulfilling, with wages and prices rising more slowly.
Inflation was 7.6 percent at the end of 1989 when the law was passed. By the end of 1991, it was 2 percent. Mr. Brash did a bit of a global campaigning, describing New Zealand's success to his fellow central bankers at a conference in Jackson Hole, Wyo. -- and to anyone else who would listen.
One by one, more countries adopted the approach. Canada, grappling with persistently high inflation, set an inflation target of 2 percent in 1991. Countries including Sweden and Britain soon followed.
Britain takes its 2 percent target seriously enough that the governor of the Bank of England has to write a letter to the chancellor of the Exchequer, explaining whenever inflation misses by more than a percentage point in either direction -- the economic policy equivalent of a naughty student writing an apology on the blackboard.
But the more that countries set about announcing a target, the more keen was the discussion about the actual number.
One view was that zero inflation should be the goal -- that a dollar today should have the same buying power as a dollar in a decade, or two or three. That was the view embraced by, among others, Paul A. Volcker, the former Fed chairman. Alan Greenspan, Mr. Volcker's successor at the Fed, argued that inflation needed to be low enough that it didn't have to be factored into business decisions.
Either of those approaches would imply that a proper target would be zero, or perhaps 0.5 percent or 1 percent, given the difficulty of measuring inflation precisely.
But there was an alternate view -- that keeping inflation that low might be dangerous. And the person mounting that argument most forcefully within the Federal Reserve in the 1990s was a Fed governor named Janet L. Yellen.
Behind the oversize doors of the Federal Reserve's boardroom on Constitution Avenue in Washington, the fight over whether the world's largest economy should emulate the likes of Canada and New Zealand took place in 1995 and 1996.
Ms. Yellen, who now runs the institution, worried that announcing an inflation target would make the Fed focus only on inflation and neglect its responsibilities to bolster growth and jobs. She worried that zero inflation could paralyze the economy, particularly during slumps, and felt that some inflation was necessary.
"To my mind the most important argument for some low inflation rate is the 'greasing-the-wheels argument,"' Ms. Yellen said in a closed-door meeting of Fed policy makers in July 1996.
When businesses run into rough times, they may be inclined to cut workers' pay. But in practice, that doesn't happen much. Even in a severe downturn, businesses are more likely to cut hours, conduct layoffs or keep positions vacant than cut pay. That's one reason recessions tend to lead to higher unemployment instead of lower wages.
Inflation helps deal with this problem. When there is a bit of inflation, employers can hold workers' pay steady during a downturn yet have it decline in inflation-adjusted terms. Inflation creates an adjustment mechanism: An assembly line worker may keep making exactly $20 an hour through a downturn, but in inflation-adjusted terms that pay falls by 2 percent a year, which could make the factory less likely to resort to layoffs.
In that 1996 debate, another argument that Ms. Yellen raised against a zero percent target was particularly prescient. The higher the level of inflation, the more that central banks can stimulate the economy during a downturn.
Imagine that there is a severe recession and the Fed cuts interest rates to zero, so that when you put money in the bank you get no return. If there is no inflation, your money will retain its purchasing power and be worth the same when you withdraw it. But if there is inflation, the value of your money sitting in the bank becomes steadily less valuable, meaning that you have more incentive to spend or invest it.
"A little inflation permits real interest rates to become negative on the rare occasions when required to counter a recession," Ms. Yellen said in 1996. "This could be important."
She, along with her colleagues across the world of central banking, had no idea just how important.
Ms. Yellen's argument -- that some inflation would help grease the economy's wheels and give central banks more flexibility to respond to a downturn -- prevailed, in the sense that 2 percent became the widespread target of global central banks.
But even as that target was embraced, signs started to emerge that it wasn't high enough to avoid the kinds of problems that Ms. Yellen and others had described.
Starting in the late 1990s, Japan found itself stuck in a pattern of falling prices, or deflation, even after it cut interest rates all the way to zero. The United States suffered a mild recession in 2001, and the Fed cut interest rates to 1 percent to help spur a recovery. Then came the global financial crisis of 2007 to 2009, spurring a steep downturn across the planet and causing central banks to slash interest rates.
All of this has quite a few smart economists wondering whether the central bankers got the target number wrong. If they had set it a bit higher, perhaps at 3 or 4 percent, they might have been better able to combat the Great Recession because they could cut inflation-adjusted interest rates by more.
"Should policy makers therefore aim for a higher target inflation rate in normal times, in order to increase the room for monetary policy to react to such shocks?" asked Olivier Blanchard, the chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, in a 2010 paper with two co-authors. "To be concrete, are the net costs of inflation much higher at, say, 4 percent than at 2 percent, the current target range?"
Mr. Blanchard offered no definitive answer, but others are more confident that 2 percent inflation has proved misguided.
"It's kind of a historical accident that we have a 2 percent target to begin with," said Laurence Ball, an economist at Johns Hopkins University who advocates raising the target to 4 percent. "Any adverse effects on the economy of having 4 percent rather than 2 percent inflation are trivial compared to the effects of having a horrible recession like we've been experiencing."
Such a shift would come at a cost. At 2 percent inflation, it is easy to enter into many financial transactions without really having to adjust for inflation. At 2 percent inflation, the value of a dollar falls by half over 35 years, whereas at 4 percent it falls in half every 18 years. On the other hand, inflation also hovered in the range of 3 to 4 percent through the mid-1980s, hardly remembered as an economic nightmare.
A shift in the target, furthermore, could well cause disruptions in financial markets and potentially a sharp, sudden rise in longer-term interest rates that could slow growth.
Current central bankers view the cost of raising the target as too high to pay. The Fed's vice chairman, Stanley Fischer, reasserted his support of a 2 percent target earlier this month. And Ms. Yellen has given no indication that she wishes to rethink the target.
Alan Blinder, the Princeton economist and a former vice chairman of the Fed, saw it this way: "Central bankers have invested a lot and established a great deal of credibility on their 2 percent inflation target, and I think they're right to be very hesitant to give it up. If you change from 2 percent to 3 percent, how does the market know you won't change 3 to 4?"
But that doesn't mean you wouldn't do something different, Mr. Blinder argued, if you could rerun the history of the last 25 years, from New Zealand's unusual experiment to the present, all while knowing what you know now.
"Probably in the abstract had they settled on a somewhat bigger number, that would have been a better choice," Mr. Blinder said. "To many academics that means that was a mistake so let's undo it and do it right. In the practical policy world that's not always right."

Full text:   The United States, once a world leader in its percentage of women in the work force, has fallen behind many other nations in that category. "The Flexibility Gap," in Sunday Business last week, looked at the shift -- and at how a lack of family-friendly workplace policies may be a contributing factor in many choices of American women.

I've experienced this through different lenses over the years: stay-at-home mom, part-time and full-time employment and full-time self-employment. There are pluses and minuses for each, but the only one I would refuse to do over unless I really had to (which, at the time, I did) was full-time employment with young children. I was belittled at work, singled out constantly and required to demonstrate my loyalty by working on weekends and staying late at night -- even when my single, childless co-workers were not expected to do so unless there was a real need. At home, I struggled to be the parent I wanted to be with too little time and even less energy.
STACY, MANHATTAN
It is a cruel society that encourages women to go to college and succeed at work, but insists that 12 weeks after giving birth they need to be back in the office. Women are bright, educated and valuable employees. As a society we have invested enormous resources in their education, yet we don't back our investment in them at the biggest life moment for a couple. Things need to change.
MIKE, NY
Excuse me, but speaking as an older woman who did not have children and worked at professional jobs, why is it the employer's obligation to facilitate one's personal lifestyle? If a woman chooses to have kids and raise them, that is her personal business, not the responsibility of the employer.
STEPHANIE S, L.A.
While the educated and privileged upper middle class debate whether women receive equal pay for equal work, a person lower on the socioeconomic ladder is taking care of our young children for a pittance. Something to ponder, folks.
KAREN , DENVER
To those who think women should have longer maternity leave, start your own business. Let's see if you're willing to give other women long maternity leave when you're a business owner. And don't tell me the government should pay for it because our government is broke.

Those European policies all look fine till you look at the high unemployment rates, ossified economies and stagnation that exist in many European countries.
CHARLES, NEW YORK
For all those who chose to have no children and think that the government and employers do not need to give consideration to pregnant women or parents with young children, etc.: Would you want such consideration if you were disabled in an accident? You are not in the Wild West where all people fend for themselves.
MADRE, NYC
Left out are older women who often fill in for a daughter's role as mother with young children when she has to go back to work. Older women also care for chronically ill spouses or parents. Our society is able but not willing to create better work cultures for accomplished women.
HLR, CALIFORNIA
The real dynamic is that there are not enough decent jobs left that can support a family.
CASEY, CALIFORNIA
In "Home Buyers, Optimistic but Not Wild-Eyed," the Economic View column last Sunday, Robert J. Shiller described those buyers' relatively modest 10-year expectations for the value of their homes. He also noted that, historically, buying a house has not been a great investment, with average inflation-corrected appreciation running at just a third of 1 percent a year since 1890.
These comments, from nytimes.com, have been edited and condensed.
Why we as a society feel the need to subsidize a poor investment needs to be re-examined with great urgency. Incentivizing the misappropriation of capital is a loser for the broader economy, denying potentially better investment vehicles simply because they lack subsidy. If this weren't bad enough, housing has been the epicenter of two major financial crises in the last 30 years. Enough. It's time to end the tax-distorting incentives to buy and leverage residential housing.
FRANK FERRARA, PORT CHESTER, NY
Homeownership is not for everyone; not everyone can afford it. Furthermore, this new generation seems more willing to pack up and move, is career-driven and enjoys its lifestyle, making owning more a hassle than an investment.

Full text:   MOSCOW -- A relaxed, at times jovial President Vladimir V. Putin brushed aside fears about Russian financial turmoil Thursday, holding court for reporters in a Moscow hotel and answering unscreened questions on topics ranging from his love life to the Ukraine crisis to the campaign against perceived "fifth columnists" in the state-controlled news media.
The three-hour news conference provided Mr. Putin with a platform to make his first public remarks since the ruble exchange rate began swinging wildly earlier in the week. He said that Russia's current economic tumult could last at most two years, and rather than offer a specific remedy, he suggested that revived global demand for oil would eventually solve the problems.
"We are going through a trying period, difficult times at the moment," said Mr. Putin, answering questions at his annual end-of-year news conference. "I would not call the situation a crisis. You may call it whatever you want."
In his more confrontational moments, the 62-year-old president found a new way to expound on his favorite theme this year: that he was determined to thwart plots by the West in general and the United States in particular against Russia. Using the symbol of the Russian bear, Mr. Putin said he wondered how the creature should behave.
"Maybe he should stop chasing pigs and boars around the taiga, but start picking berries and eating honey. Maybe then he will be left alone," Mr. Putin said, warming to the analogy. "But no, he won't be! Because someone will always try to chain him up. As soon as he's chained, they will tear out his teeth and claws."
The latter, he said, was a reference to Russia's nuclear deterrence.
His remarks on the economy held the most interest, given that the price of oil and the Russian ruble plummeted in tandem this week, with the ruble testing historic lows of 80 to the dollar before rallying to closer to 60, though still down about 40 percent on the year.
Analysts said the decline reflected not just the drop in oil prices but also investors' distrust of the government's ability to cope, or to promote economic growth through something other than oil exports.
"Economically, socially and politically, the country will have to go through severe economic tests in the years to come," said Dmitri Trenin, the head of the Carnegie Moscow Center. "Not having a working, realistic, credible model for economic development, not just muddling through, will become critical."
Mr. Putin acknowledged that many Russians blamed Elvira Nabiullina, the governor of the central bank, for the crisis, but he defended the record of the bank.
"I believe that the central bank and the government are taking adequate measures," he said. He did not present any new policies or a specific plan to address the problems, but rejected predictions that currency controls were in the offing.
He also said Russia should try not to waste its $419 billion in currency reserves. The central bank has spent about $75 billion this year defending the ruble.
Mr. Putin described the problems as rooted in external factors, including the drop of about 50 percent in oil prices this year and Western sanctions imposed over Russia's incursion into Ukraine. He said that global demand for oil would recover next year or in two years, and that this would solve the problem.
The president, sitting on a small stage in an amphitheater in a Moscow hotel, seemed to be relying on his high popularity to carry the day, noting that Russia had emerged from the 2008 financial crisis relatively unscathed under his leadership. But it remained an open question whether that would be enough to persuade Russians, who are facing a sharp recession next year.
"Above all, the goal was to calm people down about the crisis," Mikhail Vinogradov, head of the St. Petersburg Politics Foundation, said by telephone shortly after the speech. "The question is whether Putin's calming words will turn into any kind of action."
Ordinary Russians are worried about the ruble's collapse and rising inflation, which is expected to climb 10 percent by the end of the year and even higher early next year. They have flooded car dealerships, appliance stores and malls to spend savings before their rubles lose any more value.
The popular discount Swedish furniture chain Ikea has been mobbed for the last week. On Thursday, the company announced that it was suspending all sales of kitchen furniture and appliances for two days to catch up with the orders. It also announced that it would raise prices -- a common step by importers trying to keep up with the lower value of the ruble. Russia depends on imports for about 30 percent of its consumer goods.
Mr. Putin accused the West of trying to build a virtual wall around Russia by moving NATO forces closer to its border, and noted that the $50 billion that Russia plans to spend on its military next year is much less than the Pentagon's budget.
He also conceded that Russia had contributed to a recent rise in global tensions by resuming long-range military surveillance flights across Europe and along the edges of North America. "The only thing we have done is to protect our interests in a tougher way," he said.
That theme plays well at home, where political analysts estimate as much as 40 percent of the population wants Russia to regain its superpower status.
Mr. Putin slipped in some criticism of the C.I.A. torture report in response to a question about the legality of burning the homes of suspected terrorists in Chechnya. "After 9/11, torture was legalized. How could you explain that?" he asked, a reference to the waterboarding of terror suspects by the C.I.A. during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Mr. Putin estimated that 25 to 30 percent of the economic distress was rooted in the sanctions over Ukraine, but conceded that Russia had not done enough to diversify an economy in which energy resources constitute 60 percent of the country's exports.
Even while Mr. Putin was speaking, the European Union imposed an array of new sanctions involving investment, services and trade linked to Russia's annexation of Crimea.
Russian corporations owe approximately $650 billion to Western banks, but sanctions have eliminated any chance of refinancing that debt. The foreign reserves should cover that for the time being, Mr. Putin suggested, though some analysts say as much as half of that -- around $200 billion -- is tied up in other obligations, like pensions.
Mr. Putin stressed that Russia wanted to solve the crisis in Ukraine, and said he thought that President Petro O. Poroshenko of Ukraine did, too, but that some nationalists there did not.
In response to a question from a Ukrainian reporter about how many Russian soldiers had been dispatched into eastern Ukraine and how many had died there, Mr. Putin again called Russian fighters volunteers. He did not say how many had died. Still, Russia has toned down its rhetoric on Ukraine in the last month.
The news conference is an annual ritual, with Mr. Putin picking questions at random from 1,200 or so reporters ranging from the mainstream Russian press to the BBC.
In one awkward moment, a Russian reporter suggested in slurred speech that Mr. Putin support the sale of kvass, a mildly alcoholic beverage, in international chain stores. Mr. Putin suggested that the man might have been sipping a little. The Russian media soon reported that the reporter was not drunk, but that his speech had been slurred by two strokes.
Several journalists asked why the state media had been unleashed to attack government critics as fifth columnists, to which Mr. Putin said it was sometimes hard to tell where "the opposition ends and the fifth column starts." A fifth column is a group that tries to undermine a larger group.
One reporter asked about Mr. Putin's personal life. The president answered by saying that recently a European dignitary had asked him whether he had any love in his life.
Mr. Putin said he had assured the unidentified visitor that he did, that he saw his former wife periodically as well as his two grown daughters. "Everything is fine," he said.

Full text:   What happens when you turn over regulatory responsibilities to people who think there is really no need for regulation?
The United States, and much of the world, tried that for a large part of the last quarter-century. Along the way, a series of crises sent out warning signals that were not heeded.
After the economy recovered from the stock market crash of 1987, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman who had poured money into the market to stem the damage, was celebrated as a hero. He believed in what came to be derided as "market fundamentalism," holding that markets were far smarter than governments and would produce optimal results if only there were no interference from politicians.
That analysis certainly seemed reasonable through much of the 1990s. The economy grew without a recession for 10 years, the longest such stretch in United States history. A few people worried that bad things could happen as a result of the explosive growth in derivative securities, but they were largely marginalized by the obvious fact that only good things were happening.
One reason recessions were previously more common was that the Fed often found itself -- in the words of William McChesney Martin Jr., the chairman of the Fed from 1951 to 1970 -- "in the position of the chaperone who has ordered the punch bowl removed just when the party was really warming up."
He made that remark in 1955, after the Fed raised interest rates repeatedly, seeking to slow the economy even though the inflation rate was close to zero. Fed officials, The New York Times reported at the time, cited "the continued buoyancy of the stock market" as a reason to fear that "the surge of economic growth has enhanced expectations of growth beyond reasonable limits."
That was exactly what was happening in the late 1990s, but Mr. Greenspan saw no reason to be concerned about rapidly rising asset prices. Was it not clear that markets were efficient?
Starting in 1997, a series of crises appeared to be unrelated. Each was viewed as an extraordinary event.
It went largely unnoticed that those crises had something in common: destabilizing factors caused by financial innovation and the lack of regulation.
That was true in Asia, where countries had followed the advice of groups like the International Monetary Fund and done nothing to control huge flows of capital into their economies. When the news turned bad, that capital tried to flee. Currencies collapsed and bailouts ensued.
Then came the collapse of the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund. It had used too much leverage as it traded derivative securities with strategies that assumed some market relationships were sure things. The Fed had to step in to persuade -- some might say force -- the big banks to bail out the fund.
As share prices rose in the 1990s, many concluded that the stock market was a sure thing, at least in the long run. A book called "Dow 36,000" became a best seller. People quit good jobs to join start-ups, hoping that stock options would make them rich when their new employer went public. Silicon Valley won a bitter battle to keep company books from having to reflect the real value of the options being handed out, arguing in essence that the party might end if that happened.
Executives at more than a few companies -- Enron and WorldCom being the most notable -- cooked the books to allow themselves to share in the riches.
When share prices of high-flying technology and telecommunications companies collapsed in 2000 and 2001, the scandals led to passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley law, which for the first time created a regulator to pay attention to the auditors, whose work had been woefully inadequate. Wall Street analysts faced new rules on the theory that they had promoted stocks they knew were worthless.
But few wanted to mess with the financial engineers.
Instead, their standing only grew. Bank capital rules came to allow the banks to use their own -- presumably sophisticated -- models to calculate how much capital was needed for any asset they owned. Countries like Ireland and Iceland developed large banking systems and were hailed for finding high-paying, nonpolluting jobs.
"All the new financial products that have been created in recent years contribute economic value by unbundling risks and reallocating them in a highly calibrated manner," Mr. Greenspan said in early 2000. "The rising share of finance in the business output of the United States and other countries is a measure of the economic value added by the ability of these new instruments and techniques to enhance the process of wealth creation."
Mr. Greenspan was far from the only one to be entranced by the wisdom of Wall Street. In another speech that spring, Lawrence Summers, the Treasury secretary at the time, discussed the problems of "market overconfidence, the toxic combination of overleverage and illiquidity, nontransparency and the risks that hedging strategies and models may not live up to their design" that had been demonstrated by Long-Term Capital Management's collapse.
But did that mean Washington needed to act? Far from it.
"Let me be clear," Mr. Summers said in a speech to the Futures Industry Association. "It is the private sector, not the public sector, that is in the best position to provide effective supervision. Market discipline is the first line of defense in maintaining the integrity of our financial system."
And it was to be the only line. Later that year, with bipartisan support, Congress passed, and President Bill Clinton signed, the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000. That act barred the regulation of over-the-counter derivatives.
Had there been such regulation, it is at least possible that the financial crisis might have been less severe than it was. To a significant extent, derivatives enabled risk to be shifted from those who understood it to those who did not. Securities deemed risk-free by the rating agencies turned out to be worthless. Much of the financial innovation that so impressed Mr. Greenspan had been designed to let banks find ways to reduce their capital levels without the regulators noticing.
"I hear about these wonderful innovations in the financial markets and they sure as hell need a lot of innovation," Paul Volcker, the former Fed chairman, said in late 2009. He said two of them -- credit-default swaps and collateralized debt obligations -- had nearly destroyed the economy.
"The most important financial innovation that I have seen the past 20 years," he added, "is the automated teller machine."
There is still good reason to think that markets are better at allocating capital than are governments. But if the events leading up to the financial crisis proved anything, it is that markets freed of meaningful oversight did a horrible job.
After the crisis, financial regulation was stepped up around the world. Significantly, the countries that seem to have been the most vigilant in raising bank capital standards are the United States, Britain and Switzerland. They are the countries that have the biggest financial sectors -- and thus the most to lose if their banks again teeter on the brink of collapse.
Perhaps the standard Walter Lippman set in 1933 -- that a good crisis is one that leads to solutions of the problems that caused the crisis -- was met. But the new reforms have not been tested.
It could be that the test is beginning in Russia, where the ruble has collapsed to the point that Russian merchants are reluctant to accept it. Capital is fleeing, and Russia appears to be hesitant to use its vaunted foreign exchange reserves to defend the currency. The government says it will not impose capital controls, but such promises only serve to increase fears they will be broken.
In the 1960s, when exchange rates were fixed -- at least until a crisis forced action -- there was a saying: "He lied like a finance minister on the eve of devaluation."
The important issue for the world's financial system is the extent to which the crisis can be contained. Russian companies owe a lot of euros and dollars, and the lenders -- banks and bondholders -- could suffer substantial losses. Such losses could force them to sell other assets, spreading the crisis. Already stock markets and currencies in other emerging markets are losing value, reflecting the fear of contagion. We can hope that Western banks really do have enough capital cushion to weather any storm that may develop.
In normal times, a country in trouble can turn to the I.M.F. for a bailout, albeit one with strings. Russia probably cannot do that on terms it would be willing to accept, given Western anger over its actions in Ukraine.
Indeed, wags are already suggesting a title for a book to be written about the crisis: "Crimean Punishment."

Full text:   CARACAS, Venezuela -- IT seemed an unfortunate coincidence that just as scores of people demonstrating against police brutality were being arrested on the streets of New York and other cities, the United States Congress passed a bill to bring sanctions against members of my country's government for alleged human rights abuses during protests earlier this year.
While Congress accused Venezuela's government of cracking down on dissent, African-American communities across the United States expressed outrage over police killings of unarmed black men. Then, as legislators on Capitol Hill criticized Venezuelan officials for purported violations of democratic norms, a Senate report revealed the extent of torture by the Central Intelligence Agency.
The antigovernment protests in our country that began in February resulted in the deaths of more than 40 people, many of whom were either pro-government supporters or innocent bystanders. Of those deaths, a significant number were caused by antigovernment demonstrators, who used violence to try to oust our democratically elected government. Rather than engaging in lawful and peaceful demonstrations, those protesters used barricades and burning debris to block streets. They also caused the deaths of several motorcyclists by stringing wires across roads.
Our government responded with restraint, allowing those violent demonstrations to go on for several months. Every effort was made to ensure that only protesters who directly violated laws or placed the lives of others in danger were detained. For example, those responsible for burning public buses with Molotov cocktails, or who set fire to a public university, were rightly arrested and charged -- as were 17 state security agents accused of using excessive force against protesters, who are awaiting trial.
Eventually, our citizens grew tired of those protests and their incoherent tactics, which only created chaos and insecurity in our streets. The unrest subsided, and the opposition lost credibility. The leader of the opposition coalition Mesa de la Unidad Democrática (the Democratic Unity Roundtable) subsequently resigned after disagreements within the organization.
After the death of my good friend, and our president, Hugo Chávez, almost two years ago, our country has experienced a series of difficulties, including economic problems. As president of the National Assembly and the vice president of the United Socialist Party of Venezuela, which was founded by Mr. Chávez, I have worked with President Nicolás Maduro to find viable solutions.
To respond to the falling price of oil, which underpins our economy, we are cutting public spending by 20 percent. But we will not cut funding to our key social programs, which provide essential medical care, education and welfare to our citizens. We are also taking measures to battle the high inflation that has plagued our nation over the past two years, and we are battling to end the black-market dollar trading that sabotages our foreign exchange system.
Some months ago, Mr. Maduro extended an olive branch to the Obama administration by naming an ambassador to the United States, and inviting Washington to name an ambassador to Venezuela. Mr. Maduro also named me to lead a high-level commission to repair relations with the United States government. To date, President Obama has neither accepted our ambassador, nor offered his own in return. And there has been no sign from Washington of any intent to engage with my commission.
Imposing sanctions against a country that has caused no harm to the United States is no way to move toward a constructive relationship. Unilateral sanctions against other nations have usually failed and have been rejected by a majority of the international community.
In Cuba, a decades-long trade embargo caused great hardship but failed to realize the United States' objective of ending the Cuban revolution. The United Nations' many votes to lift the embargo exposed how isolated Washington had been in its policy. It would be regrettable if sanctions against Venezuela, first opposed by the White House, now became a way for the Obama administration to appease those in Congress who oppose the historic restoration of relations between the United States and Cuba.
A majority of Venezuelans, regardless of party affiliation, reject these sanctions and view them as baseless aggression. We will not be bullied by efforts to weaken or discredit our government.
We have tried to move toward improving relations with the Obama administration, but have been rebuffed. We can only wonder if the timing of these sanctions is an attempt to distract public opinion from the exposure of rights violations by United States law enforcement officers.

Abstract: Ms. Yellen's remarks, and a statement issued by the Fed's policy-making committee, both emphasized that the nation's central bank was not inclined to act more quickly in light of positive economic news, including stronger job growth and plummeting oil prices. Fed officials have also expressed relatively little concern about the collapse of oil prices, the crumbling of the Russian economy or turbulence in global markets.

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDEDWASHINGTON -- Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, said on Wednesday that the Fed still expected to start raising interest rates next year, but that it would wait patiently for the right time and did not expect to begin any earlier than late April.
Ms. Yellen's remarks, and a statement issued by the Fed's policy-making committee, both emphasized that the nation's central bank was not inclined to act more quickly in light of positive economic news, including stronger job growth and plummeting oil prices.
"The committee considers it unlikely to begin the normalization process for at least the next couple of meetings," Ms. Yellen said at news conference after a two-day meeting of Fed policy makers. In response to a question, she said she meant two meetings, ruling out scheduled sessions in January and March.
Stock markets, which have jittered up and down in recent days, rose sharply after the Fed released its statement at 2 p.m. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 2 percent to close at 2,012.89, its largest daily percentage gain of the year.
"The Fed is in the fortunate position of enabling the economy to gather steam without the shadow of immediately rising rates," said Paul Atkinson, head of North American equities at Aberdeen Asset Management, a British firm with $525 billion in investments. "In our opinion, that has to be positive for equity investors."
Bond markets moved in the opposite direction as traders struggled to weigh the impact of the Fed news and events in Russia. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury rose to 2.14 percent from 2.08 percent late Tuesday.
For almost a year now, Fed officials have pointed toward the summer of 2015 as the most likely time for the long-awaited lift of short-term interest rates, which the Fed has held near zero since December 2008.
Fifteen of the 17 Fed officials who participate in meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee said the first rate increase would come in 2015, according to an aggregation of their economic outlooks also published on Wednesday.
The job market has not healed completely, but Ms. Yellen and other Fed officials say the economy is now strong enough to allow them to start raising rates toward more normal levels next year. Employers added, on balance, a monthly average of 224,000 jobs over the 12 months ending in November, including 321,000 jobs in November. The unemployment rate has fallen to 5.8 percent from 7 percent.
Officials predicted the unemployment rate would fall into a range they regard as healthy for the economy in 2015, ending the year between 5.2 and 5.3 percent.
Fed officials have also expressed relatively little concern about the collapse of oil prices, the crumbling of the Russian economy or turbulence in global markets.
Ms. Yellen said on Wednesday that lower oil prices were "certainly good" for American consumers, who have more money to spend. As for Russia, she said the exposure of the American economy and financial system was "actually relatively small."
But the sluggish pace of inflation has replaced unemployment as the main reason that the Fed may keep rates near zero for at least a little longer.
Fed policy has failed to lift inflation back toward the 2 percent annual pace the central bank has fixed as its target. The Fed's preferred measure of inflation increased by just 1.4 percent during the 12 months ending in October, and the annualized pace has not touched 2 percent in more than two years.
In new forecasts published on Wednesday, Fed officials sharply downgraded their 2015 inflation expectations, predicting that prices would rise a mere 1 to 1.6 percent. In September they predicted inflation in 2015 of 1.6 to 1.9 percent.
Officials also continued to predict a quick rebound. The forecast for 2016 remained unchanged, with a predicted pace of 1.7 to 2 percent.
That forecast is based on an assumption shared by most Fed officials about the way inflation works. They believe expectations about future inflation, and labor market slack, both exert a powerful influence over the actual pace of inflation. Surveys show little change in expectations and so, as the labor market continues to tighten, Ms. Yellen and other Fed officials expect that inflation will increase.
But Ms. Yellen added that the Fed would act only once it was "reasonably confident" that this story was indeed playing out.
"Historically we have seen as the economy strengthens and slack diminishes that inflation does tend to gradually rise over time," she said. "I will be looking for evidence that I think strengthens my confidence in that view."
But Fed officials also concede that the workings of inflation remain somewhat mysterious. Inflation, for example, did not slow as much as many officials expected when unemployment was high during the recession. Charles L. Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said in a recent interview that he also did not take much comfort from the steadiness of inflation expectations.
"It's either rock solid and the public understands it or they really don't move for any reason," he said. "So the fact that the market measures have moved down makes me nervous, perhaps more nervous than some others."
The Fed removed from the latest policy statement the phrase that it would wait a "considerable time" before starting to raise rates, widely interpreted as meaning at least six months. But at the same time, it said the Fed did not intend to signal a change in intentions.
"The committee judges that it can be patient in beginning to normalize the stance of monetary policy," said the statement issued by the Federal Open Market Committee. "The committee sees this guidance as consistent with its previous statement."
Ms. Yellen began her news conference, shortly after the release of the statement, by emphasizing that the Fed's new statement "does not represent a change in our policy intentions."
She said the change in language was made because the "considerable time" language was tied to the conclusion of the Fed's bond purchase program.
The change, however, was backed by just seven of the 10 voting members of the policy committee, reflecting an unusual degree of fragmentation for an institution that prizes consensus.
There were dueling dissents in favor of more and less patience.
Narayana Kocherlakota, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, dissented because he said the Fed should do more to raise inflation, which he sees as a way to encourage more growth in jobs and output.
Richard W. Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, and Charles I. Plosser, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, both dissented because they said the Fed was not retreating from its stimulus position fast enough.
None of the men, however, will serve among the voting members of the committee next year. They will be replaced by presidents of other reserve banks. And they all have announced their intention to retire from the Fed over the next year or so.
Correction: December 19, 2014, Friday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A capsule summary on Thursday for an article about the Federal Reserve's latest policy statement misstated its expected actions next year. As the article in Business Day correctly noted, the Fed will raise interest rates, not cut them.

Full text:   The wealthy are getting wealthier. As for everyone else, no such luck.
A report released on Wednesday by the Pew Research Center found that the wealth gap between the country's top 20 percent of earners and the rest of America had stretched to its widest point in at least three decades.
Last year, the median net worth of upper-income families reached $639,400, nearly seven times as much of those in the middle, and nearly 70 times the level of those at the bottom of the income ladder.
There has been growing attention to the issue of income inequality, particularly the plight of those earning the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour or close to it.
But while income and wealth are related (the more you make, the more you can save and invest), the wealth gap zeros in on a different aspect of financial well-being: how much money and other assets you have accumulated over time, including the value of your home and car plus any investments in stocks, bonds and the like.
Think of it as "a measure of the family 'nest egg,' " as Pew calls it -- a hoard that can sustain a household during an emergency, like the loss of a job, and in the long run can see someone through retirement.
The wealth gap "exposes varying degrees of vulnerability," said Valerie Wilson, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a left-of-center research group in Washington, adding that it also was passed down through the generations.
While those at the top have managed to recoup much of the wealth lost during the economic downturn, middle-income families have not made any gains.
"The Great Recession destroyed a significant amount of middle-income and lower-income families' wealth, and the economic 'recovery' has yet to be felt for them," the report concluded.
Pew, which used data from the Federal Reserve, defined middle income as $44,000 a year for a family of four, while a yearly income of $132,000 for the same-size family pushed a household into the upper ranks. About one in five families qualifies for that higher status, while 46 percent occupy the middle range.
The median household net worth last year for those in the middle was $96,500, only slightly above the $94,300 mark it hit in 1983 (after being adjusted for inflation). A poor household actually had a higher median net worth 30 years ago ($11,400 in 1983) than it counted last year ($9,300). Compare those results with the top fifth of income earners. In 1983, when the Fed began collecting the data, that group had a median wealth of $318,000; in 2013 it owned more than twice that.
Other economists have traced the growing wealth gap to a much narrower slice of the population. In a working paper recently released by the National Bureau of Economic Research, Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman argued, "The rise in wealth inequality is almost entirely due to the rise of the top 0.1 percent wealth share, from 7 percent in 1979 to 22 percent in 2012."
The share of wealth controlled by the bottom 90 percent of Americans, they concluded, has steadily declined since the mid-1980s.
The Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz is part of a growing group of economists who argue that wealth inequality hurts economic growth. The latest increases in wealth, Mr. Stiglitz said, are the result of existing assets ballooning in value -- like a penthouse apartment with a river view -- rather than productive investment.
"If more of the savings of the economy leads to an increase in the value of land rather than the stock of capital goods, then worker productivity won't go up," Mr. Stiglitz explained on the blog for the Institute for New Economic Thinking, where he serves on the board. "Wages won't go up. So some of what is going on is that we haven't been doing the kind of investment that we should be doing."
The report on Wednesday is the second in recent days from Pew detailing how different groups of Americans are faring financially more than five years after the recession ended. The earlier study found a growing racial and ethnic wealth gap, with whites registering a median wealth of nearly $142,000, 13 times the net worth of blacks and 10 times that of Hispanics.
The evidence from the report, Pew said, "could help explain why, by other measures, the majority of Americans are not feeling the impact of the economic recovery, despite an improvement in the unemployment rate, stock market and housing prices."

To the Editor:
Re "No Relief for Air Travelers" (editorial, Dec. 16):
Air travel difficulties are utterly avoidable, but require a readjustment of expectations concerning markets. Indeed, whether free to compete or free to merge, airlines have largely underserved their customers (and employees).
Continuing public (and congressional) contention over air-travel quality may justify a re-examination of what air service really is: a competitive product, or simply a public utility. The traveling public would be overwhelmingly satisfied with simple, consistent, affordable average ticket pricing; a comfortable seating arrangement on a modern, efficient aircraft; and reliable scheduling within a comprehensive network of destinations.
None of that requires a competitive free-for-all or complex mergers, but rather an air travel industry more organized like modern European or Asian rail, or even United States commuter train services: a single, regulated operator held to standards of service and safety, with very simple consistent pricing.
Continuing frustrations with airline travel stem from a misapplication of commercial and competitive principles.
MATT ANDERSSON Hinsdale, Ill., Dec. 16, 2014
The writer is the founder and former chief executive of Indigo Airlines.
To the Editor:
While fuel prices have abated from historic highs, focusing on fuel alone ignores the many fixed costs that determine the price of a plane ticket, like aircraft, rent, landing fees and labor, to name just a few. The average round-trip domestic fare has actually fallen 10 percent over the last decade, thanks in large part to price competition among the airlines.
Airlines have returned to profitability while delivering better service for their customers, all while keeping airfares low. That's great news for air travelers.
NICHOLAS E. CALIO Washington, Dec. 16, 2014

The writer is president and chief executive of Airlines for America, the industry trade organization for the leading United States airlines.
To the Editor:
Any airline has to be a big business to compete. Many flights are a legitimate business expense and a tax deduction. Others are rewards for various types of frequent fliers. The lines and crowding are part of air traffic now. (Have we forgotten the daily mobs at Penn Station or the Port Authority Bus Terminal?)
Airlines are also competing with newer, relatively inexpensive modes of communication, like smartphones and Skype. We have many communication alternatives to our overpriced airlines. Perhaps we need to consider more use of phones or just slowing down. Few visits are so critical that they must be made at the speed of flight. Airline prices will not go down until we slow down!
THEODORE S. VOELKER Copake, N.Y., Dec. 16, 2014
To the Editor:
The falling price of fuel may be the most glaring disconnect to the cost of the average plane ticket, and you are correct to characterize this as an example of the extraordinarily consolidated airline industry exerting its control. Thankfully, there is a solution to this problem that lies with the millions of people in the United States who fly each year.
On nearly any commercial airline ticket, a traveler pays a passenger facility charge user fee, or P.F.C. The locally set and controlled P.F.C. helps make necessary improvements and upgrades to runways and terminals to ensure that flying remains safe, secure and efficient.
Most important, the P.F.C. spurs competition when it comes to providing air service. If there's anything the major airlines hate, it's competing against one another and deflating their artificially high airfares.
Not surprisingly, the airlines oppose efforts to modernize the P.F.C. to keep pace with inflation. The airlines would rather further exploit the traveling public.
Our airport system and air passengers are the big losers under an "airlines only" model. But Congress could be the hero if it moves to modernize the P.F.C., returning control back to airports, providing fare relief for passengers and fostering an even healthier airline industry.

Full text:   Russians are watching their country suffer another avoidable economic calamity. The blame for this rests largely with the disastrous policies of President Vladimir Putin, who has consistently put his ego, his territorial ambitions and the financial interests of his cronies ahead of the needs of his country.
The ruble fell as much as 19 percent on Monday after the Central Bank of Russia sharply raised its benchmark interest rate to 17 percent in the middle of the night in a desperate attempt to keep capital from fleeing the country. Since June, the Russian currency has fallen about 50 percent against the dollar. Because Russia relies heavily on imported food and other goods, the decline in its currency is fueling inflation. Consumer prices jumped 9.1 percent last month compared with a year earlier and also increased 8.3 percent in October.
Russia's immediate problems were caused by the recent collapse of global crude oil prices and the financial sanctions imposed by the United States and Europe in an effort to get Mr. Putin to stop stirring conflict in Ukraine. But the rot goes far deeper.
Long before he annexed the Crimean peninsula and began backing pro-Russian forces in eastern Ukraine, Mr. Putin created an economic system that allowed a coterie of insiders to grow wealthy on Russia's vast oil and gas reserves. He did little to diversify the economy or to make it more resilient.
Now Russian officials have to make difficult choices, none of which are good. As the ruble has collapsed, many individuals and businesses have been trying to take money out of the country or spend it; the International Monetary Fund estimated in October that about $100 billion could leave Russia by the end of the year.
The Central Bank of Russia has tried to stem that tide by raising interest rates, which in turn slams the brakes on an already fragile economy. Some analysts believe that Moscow will soon have no choice but to impose capital controls, a move that would further isolate Russia from the rest of the global economy.
Russia has large financial reserves -- about $420.5 billion at the end of November -- but some of that money is tied up in gold and sovereign wealth funds that cannot be tapped easily to defend the ruble, says Anders Aslund of the Peterson Institute. While the government does not have a large external debt, many Russian banks and corporations, including large oil and gas businesses, were on the hook for about $614 billion in foreign currency borrowing at the end of September. Some of those firms will struggle to repay their loans if Russia's economy deteriorates further and oil prices stay at current levels or decline further.
Mr. Putin has taken great relish in poking the West. Now that he is in trouble, the rest of the world is unlikely to rush to his aid. On Tuesday, a White House spokesman said that President Obama intends to sign a bill that would authorize additional sanctions on Russia's energy and defense industries. That bill would also authorize the administration to supply arms to Ukraine's government.
The sensible thing for Mr. Putin to do would be to withdraw from Ukraine. This would bring immediate relief from sanctions, and that would ease the current crisis and give officials room to start fixing the country's economic problems. The question is whether this reckless leader has been sufficiently chastened to change course.

Full text:   TEHRAN -- Risking his political standing, Iran's president stressed on Monday that he was determined to cinch a nuclear deal and prepared to take on the conservative forces who would prefer not to see an agreement with the West, even if that means continued economic sanctions on Iran.
"Some people may not like to see the sanctions lifted," the president, Hassan Rouhani, said as Iranian negotiators and their United States counterparts resumed talks in Geneva. "Their numbers are few, and they want to muddy the waters."
A deadline for those talks was extended by seven months after the parties failed to conclude a deal in November. Mr. Rouhani is continuing to maintain that a deal will be concluded. His foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said last month that an agreement could be reached in a matter of "weeks."
Both men have tied their political future to the deal, analysts say. Despite the setbacks in the talks, Mr. Rouhani stays on message on what he says is Iran's bright future.
Mr. Rouhani came to office this year promising not just to strike a nuclear deal that would lift economic sanctions but to end Iran's isolation from the world economy and to promote individual freedoms.
"The people will achieve their rights," Mr. Rouhani said. "You should also prepare for interaction with the world," he told an audience of central bank employees. "You should know that in the near future many investors will come to our country."
He acknowledged that there are groups in Iran opposed to a nuclear deal, presumably those who benefited from sanctions by tightening their grip on the economy, often officials connected to hard-line clerics and commanders.
Arrayed against these powerful figures is the entire Iranian elite, Mr. Rouhani said.
"The overwhelming majority of our nation -- intellectuals, academics, theologians, the greats and the leadership -- are in favor of getting the sanctions removed."
United States and Iranian diplomats had a preliminary meeting on Iran's nuclear program in Geneva on Monday before wider talks between Iran and six world powers get underway on Wednesday. Iran, pressured by a collapse in oil prices as well as inflation and lagging growth, wants sanctions lifted, while the world powers are demanding more control over Iran's nuclear facilities.
In a reminder of how far Iran may still have to go in guaranteeing individual rights, a spokeswoman for Mary Rezaian, the mother of the arrested American-Iranian journalist Jason Rezaian, said that Ms. Rezaian, an American, would travel to Tehran on Wednesday to try to meet him. Mr. Rezaian, a correspondent for The Washington Post, has been held in Evin prison since July 22.

Full text:   For years, even as the economy recovered and the stock market soared, most American workers saw little evidence of better times in their paychecks.
But last month's surprisingly large increase in both average hourly and weekly earnings, along with other encouraging data, has convinced many economists that falling unemployment and increased hiring are finally about to start paying off in terms of wage gains for a broader swath of workers.
"It's the beginning of an uptick, and we should see it continue over the next year or two as the unemployment rate falls and the labor market tightens," said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS, a private economics and forecasting firm. "You have to be careful, but my gut instinct is that this is the beginning of better wage performance."
Still, even the seemingly good news for wages in November wasn't clear-cut. Although overall wages increased 0.4 percent -- double what economists had been expecting -- the gain for lower-paid workers in nonsupervisory and production roles increased only 0.2 percent.
Just how much the typical employee's pay might go up in the months ahead -- and whether most workers will see significant gains or just a select few -- is a key question in the economic debate facing Wall Street, academia, officials in the Obama administration and, especially, the Federal Reserve.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, Fed policy makers will hold their final meeting of the year, followed by a news conference from Janet L. Yellen, the Fed chairwoman, where she is expected to provide further hints about when the Fed will begin raising short-term interest rates after keeping them near zero for the last six years.
The nascent uptick in wages has prompted further warnings from the more hawkish members of the Fed's policy-making council who want the central bank to start tightening monetary policy sooner, rather than later, to ward off what they see as a potential threat of inflation.
But Ms. Yellen and a majority of Fed policy makers, pointing to evidence that inflation remains well under the central bank's 2 percent target, do not appear to be unduly alarmed and probably still prefer to leave interest rates as low as possible until the trend is better established.
"Until it is unambiguous, people can spin it any way they want," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. "One month is a curiosity, two months is interesting and three months is a trend."
The split at the Fed is echoed in Washington, primarily along partisan lines. On Capitol Hill, some Republicans say it is time for the Fed to act, while Democrats in the Obama administration, like Thomas E. Perez, the labor secretary, say there is no rush.
"I welcome the point when my first concern when I get out of bed in the morning is having to address rapid wage growth," Mr. Perez said. "I'm not too worried about inflation."
As for the argument that the Fed needs to move sooner, rather than later, Mr. Perez said he "couldn't reject that in stronger terms."
"It's time for the middle class and the aspiring middle class to share in the dividends of their hard work," he added. "The folks at the top end have been doing great and our prosperity hasn't been shared."
By contrast, Representative Kevin P. Brady, a Texas Republican who is chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, has called on the Fed to move quickly, but even some conservative economists say the plunge in energy prices gives the central bank more flexibility this time around.
"Historically, inflation is something that gets out of the box because the Fed moves too slowly," said Kevin A. Hassett, director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute and a former Fed economist. "But we've had a positive energy shock, so the Fed has ample room to wait and see."
In just the last month, average gasoline prices have dropped by 25 cents, to $2.77 a gallon nationally, according to the federal Energy Information Administration, and more reductions are on the way as crude oil prices continue to fall.
And if wages keep rising, the typical American family will have a couple of thousand more dollars to spend in 2015.
Extended over the next year, November's 0.4 percent increase in average hourly earnings would equal an annual wage increase of nearly 5 percent, more than double the 2.1 percent increase recorded over the last 12 months.
"If the average is 2 percent, there are a lot of people getting next to nothing," Mr. Shepherdson said. "And 2 percent wage growth when corporate profits are skyrocketing makes people very angry."
But before anyone strikes up "Happy Days Are Here Again," Mr. Shepherdson cautioned that a previous 0.4 percent rise in wages in June 2013 was followed by no increase the next month. Similarly, the 0.4 percent gain in October 2011 also showed no signs of staying power.
What might be different this time, Mr. Shepherdson said, is that the rise in average hourly earnings coincides with other positive data, including a fall in jobless claims, a declining unemployment rate and healthy hiring by private employers, as well as an increase in job openings.
On Monday, the Federal Reserve reported that industrial production in the United States rose by 1.1 percent in November, and also revised upward the increase for October. Over all, the new data shows factory output in the United States has finally exceeded its prerecession level.
Despite the positive data recently, Fed policy makers have made clear that they won't act on rates this week, or at their next meeting in January, but rather wait at least until March and more likely June 2015, at the earliest, economists said.
One possible development on Wednesday, when policy makers wrap up their meeting, is that the Fed will tweak the language in its policy statement and drop its reference to keep rates near zero "for a considerable time."
Although optimists like Mr. Shepherdson and Mr. Behravesh say the wage gains should become broader as unemployment continues to fall, professionals on the front lines of the labor market say higher-paid, better-educated workers with specialized skills are still getting the greater share of raises right now.
"What people want to see is 1999 or 2004, when companies were saying, 'We'll hire anyone,' " said Tom Gimbel, chief executive of LaSalle Network, a Chicago staffing firm. "That's not what's happening now."
Instead, Mr. Gimbel said, salaries are rising in sectors in which experienced workers are harder to find, like technology, finance and higher-level accounting positions, and where salaries tend to be at least $80,000 or more.
For recent college graduates with liberal arts degrees, or workers in call centers and in data processing jobs, where yearly wages are less than $50,000, Mr. Gimbel said, "we're bringing people in at the same salary as 10 years ago."
Mr. Gimbel added that new college graduates were still willing to take jobs they might have rejected in the past, like working in a call center.
"They figure, "The sooner I get a job, the quicker I can start paying off a mountain of student debt,' " he said. "And for guys working as a lifeguard or in the gym, a call center is white-collar experience."

Full text:   PRINCETON, N.J. -- Len Charlap, a retired math professor, has had two outpatient echocardiograms in the past three years that scanned the valves of his heart. The first, performed by a technician at a community hospital near his home here in central New Jersey, lasted less than 30 minutes. The next, at a premier academic medical center in Boston, took three times as long and involved a cardiologist.
And yet, when he saw the charges, the numbers seemed backward: The community hospital had charged about $5,500, while the Harvard teaching hospital had billed $1,400 for the much more elaborate test. "Why would that be?" Mr. Charlap asked. "It really bothered me."
Testing has become to the United States' medical system what liquor is to the hospitality industry: a profit center with large and often arbitrary markups. From a medical perspective, blood work, tests and scans are tools to help physicians diagnose and monitor disease. But from a business perspective, they are opportunities to bring in revenue -- especially because the equipment to perform them has generally become far cheaper, smaller and more highly mechanized in the past two decades.
And echocardiograms, ultrasound pictures of the heart, are enticing because they are painless and have no side effects -- unlike CT scans, blood draws, colonoscopies or magnetic resonance imaging tests, where concerns about issues like radiation and discomfort may be limiting. Though the machines that perform them were revolutionary and expensive when they first came into practice in the 1970s, the costs have dropped considerably. Now, there are even pocket-size devices that sell for as little as $5,000 and suffice for some types of examinations.
"Old technology should be like old TVs: The price should go down," said Dr. Naoki Ikegami, a health systems expert at Keio University School of Medicine in Tokyo, who is also affiliated with the University of Pennsylvania's business school. "One of the things about the U.S. health care system is that it defies the laws of economics, and of gravity. Once the price is high, it just stays there."
With pricing uncoupled from the actual cost of business, large disparities have evolved. The five hospitals within a 15-mile radius of Mr. Charlap's home here charge an average of about $5,200 for an echocardiogram, according to an analysis of Medicare's database. The seven teaching hospitals in Boston, affiliated with Harvard, Tufts and Boston University, charge an average of about $1,300 for the same test. There are even wide variations within cities: In Philadelphia, prices range from $700 to $12,000.
Dr. David Wiener, the chairman of the advocacy committee of the American Society of Echocardiography, acknowledged the wide price rangeprice disparities but said he did not believe they were greater than those for other health care services and procedures. He attributed the variations to multiple factors, including how many hospitals and doctors perform the procedure, state regulations and the need to subsidize poorly reimbursed services.
In other countries, regulators set what are deemed fair charges, which include built-in profit. In Belgium, the allowable charge for an echocardiogram is $80, and in Germany, it is $115. In Japan, the price ranges from $50 for an older version to $88 for the newest, Dr. Ikegami said.
Because Mr. Charlap, 76, is on Medicare, which is aggressive in setting rates, he paid only about $80 toward the approximately $500 fee Medicare allows. But many private insurers continue to reimburse generously for echocardiograms billed at thousands of dollars, said Dr. Seth I. Stein, a New York physician who researches data on radiology. Hospitals pursue patients who are uninsured or underinsured for those payments, he added.
And American doctors, clinics and hospitals tend to order lots of tests. "It's one of the most lucrative revenue streams they have," said Dr. Eric J. Topol, a cardiologist at Scripps Health in San Diego who studies echocardiography. "At many hospitals, the threshold for ordering an echocardiogram is the presence of a heart."
A Miraculous Advance
Mr. Charlap's internist required his first echocardiogram because he was scheduled for elective cataract surgery at the University Medical Center of Princeton at Plainsboro. The echocardiography professional society specifically advises against ordering the test for preoperative assessment of patients with no history or symptoms of heart disease.
Using sound waves transmitted through a wandlike device applied to the chest, echocardiograms show the heart's walls in motion, the tiny valves flipping open and closed and the blood streaming through them. They can be vital before surgery in patients with weak hearts, because general anesthesia and blood loss during surgery can bring out otherwise silent problems.
Mr. Charlap had no cardiac symptoms and took long daily walks with his dog. Cataract surgery involves only local numbing, not general anesthesia.
But health considerations are not the only factor driving the use of echocardiograms in America. In Britain's National Health Service, all echocardiograms are done in hospitals without charge. There are about 250 echocardiogram centers in the country, said Dr. John Chambers, a cardiologist at St. Thomas' Hospital in London who studies echocardiography.
By contrast, in the United States, buying an echocardiogram machine is a good investment for an entrepreneurial practice. The number of echocardiograms ordered by cardiologists in the United States rose 90 percent from 1999 to 2008, according to a 2012 study. There are far more places to get one in New Jersey than in all of Britain, according to the Intersocietal Accreditation Commission, which accredits medical facilities.
While M.R.I. scanners are large and cost many millions of dollars, even high-end echocardiogram machines are generally rolled around on wheels and cost under $300,000 -- about one-third of the price three decades ago when adjusted for inflation. Laptop-size systems cost $30,000 to $100,000 -- used machines even less -- and are suitable for all but the most complicated cases.
Al Lojewski, the general manager of cardiovascular ultrasound at GE Healthcare, the world's biggest maker of ultrasound machines, said the miniaturization of electronics and the addition of processing power had led to much-higher-quality images and more precise calculations. "We provide new enhancements every year," he said.
But, like new features on an iPhone, they may be irrelevant for many people. "It's a stable technology that hasn't changed much in decades," Dr. Topol said. But new options can result in more testing anyway.
"Someone might feel, 'I bought the expensive new machine and this patient is insured, so I might as well use it,' " said Dr. Barry S. Lindenberg, a cardiologist in Schenectady, N.Y. "We have to be honest, there are abuses."
Three years ago, the echocardiography group helped develop guidelines for appropriate use of the test. "We all recognized what we needed to do," said Dr. R. Parker Ward, a cardiologist at the University of Chicago, who helped write the guidelines. He noted that noncardiologists ordered many of the unneeded exams, and that new applications, such as screening cancer patients for early warning signs of heart damage caused by chemotherapy, might expand the use of the tests.
While academic hospitals have led the call for more targeted use of echocardiograms, not all doctors comply, and "it's a black hole what's going on in offices," said Dr. Rory B. Weiner, a professor at Harvard Medical School. There is not even a good estimate of how many of the procedures are performed in the United States, although it is clearly in the tens of millions annually.
The profit margin on the test is impossible to calculate because purchase prices for the machines are secret. GE declined to provide price information for its machines in the United States or other countries. Nor would it reveal how many machines it sold in the United States, other than to say that one-third of its global sales -- $330 million out of $1.1 billion -- were in this country.
A Boom of Low-Cost Scans
The Sakakibara Heart Institute, one of Tokyo's finest private clinics, performs about 60 echocardiograms a day, or 16,000 a year.
As in the United States, doctors and hospitals in Japan are paid each time they deliver a service. (Japanese patients' co-payments vary from 10 to 30 percent.) Perhaps predictably, as in the United States, doctors there order lots of tests.
In Japan, doctors' visits tend to be brief, but patients expect to leave with a prescription -- a drug or a scan. Ultrasounds, a technology developed in Japan, are a favorite. "We test everyone; we can grasp many things with this test," said Dr. Keitaro Mahara, the director of echocardiography at the institute. "It's harmless, so the patients can receive it repeatedly."
Claims data shows that Japanese patients received 6.6 million echocardiograms last year, about five times the rate per capita in Britain.
Despite Japan's fondness for testing, its health spending is about $4,000 a year a person, or 9.6 percent of gross domestic product. By contrast, the United States spends more than $9,000 per person annually, more than 17 percent of G.D.P., although some studies indicate that health care spending is leveling off.
The difference is in part because Japan decides the value of each test and medicine, sets a price and demands that it decrease over time.
When a new technology appears, a panel of policy makers and doctors determine the value based on the degree of improvement it offers. When M.R.I. scans became available, the panel declared them twice as effective as CT scans. But because the new equipment cost eight times more than a CT scanner, few clinics were buying. Manufacturers quickly slashed the price.
The prices of medicines and tests are automatically reviewed and reduced by the panel every two years, and can drop more than 30 percent. "Hospitals need to invest in machines, but after that, they don't need to spend much to keep doing the tests," said Dr. Toshiaki Iizuka, a health economist at the University of Tokyo.
In the United States, Medicare has similarly tried to prevent overuse by reducing payments for echocardiograms performed in doctors' offices by an average of 40 percent since 2009, to only $92 today. But the result has not been fewer tests. Instead, testing has migrated to hospital outpatient departments, where higher payments for the same test prevail. And doctors can make up any shortfall by raising charges for commercially insured patients, leading to bills like the $5,500 one for Mr. Charlap's echocardiogram.
Why Such Stubborn Prices?
New Jersey had the second-highest charges for echocardiograms in the nation in 2012, 8.4 times Medicare's approved rate.
In a statement, the hospital in Princeton that performed Mr. Charlap's first, more expensive echocardiogram noted that "the vast majority of customers" paid much less than the listed prices. It added that its pricing reflected the need to offset losses because many programs, including Medicare, reimburse less than the cost of delivering services.
But that cost must cover some expenses in the United States not found in other medical systems.
The area around Princeton has had a spate of new hospital building in the past five years. The University Medical Center of Princeton at Plainsboro, which has no connection to Princeton University, cost more than $500 million to build and has a curving atrium decorated with artwork from the hospital's permanent collection. "It was like a luxurious museum," Mr. Charlap said.
Hospitals and doctors in the United States also spend far more on administrative costs than those in any other country. Even for a relatively simple test like an echocardiogram, commercial insurers often demand preapproval, and a host of middlemen and staffers are involved, driving up costs.
Although medical groups cite malpractice lawsuits for the high prices in the United States, some studies suggest that is not a major factor. California, which caps malpractice liability for noneconomic damages, has the highest average charges in the country for outpatient echocardiograms, according to a recent study in the Journal of the American College of Radiology.
What did predict price in a region, according to the analysis? The more machines, the higher the bills. "You would think increased competition would cause price to go down, but it's the opposite," said Dr. Stein, the study's author, who was then a student at Temple University School of Medicine.
A year after his first echocardiogram, Mr. Charlap had another, at Harvard's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, that showed he needed a valve replacement. Though he now feels better than ever, the valve needs monitoring. How to do it?
The newest miniature echocardiogram machines fit into a doctor's white-coat pocket and, placed on the chest during an office exam, provide a snapshot of the heart. No longer do physicians have to listen for subtle clicks and whooshes through a stethoscope. Even primary care doctors in training can use the devices, which sell for well under $10,000, to detect basic heart problems with a few hours of instruction, according to studies.
Such machines are being widely used in other countries and in pilot programs at some medical schools, but they are receiving a lukewarm welcome in the United States. Mr. Charlap's internist has not used one on him.
"It brings $350,000 imaging technology to the bedside as a screening test, at almost no cost," said Dr. Topol, who added that it would be useful on hospital rounds. "But it's not being embraced because of our model of payment."

Full text:   In July 2007, while serving as acting president as his brother underwent medical treatment, Raúl Castro delivered a startling indictment of the Cuban economy when he railed about the inefficiencies of the dairy industry. His description of the onerous and expensive mechanism to get milk from cows to dinner tables was old news to Cubans, who have been subjected for decades to a centrally planned economy that is among the world's most dysfunctional and anomalous. It soon became clear that Mr. Castro's unexpected candor that day signaled the start of a transformational era for the island's economy.
After Fidel Castro ceded power to his brother in 2008, the government initiated reforms that have allowed Cubans to start building livelihoods that are not wholly subject to state control. The pace has been halting, with plenty of backtracking from the government's old guard, which views further liberalization of the economy as an abdication of the socialist system Fidel Castro made sacrosanct.
The looming end of the Castro era -- Raúl Castro, 83, has said he will step down in 2018 -- is unfolding amid a vigorous debate on the future of the country's economy.
To date, the Obama administration has watched the reforms with skepticism. The White House has eased restrictions on remittances and travel to the island, but it has done relatively little else to pare down the web of sanctions the United States has imposed on Cuba for decades.
President Obama could help expand the role of Cuba's small but growing entrepreneurial class by relaxing sanctions through executive authority and working with the growing number of lawmakers who want to expand business with Cuba. The White House could start that process by removing Cuba from the State Department list of countries that sponsor terrorist organizations and making it easier for Americans to provide start up-capital for independent small businesses. Doing that would empower Cuban-Americans to play a more robust role in the island's economic transformation. More significantly, it would gradually erode the Cuban government's ability to blame Washington for the shortcomings of an economy that is failing its citizens largely as a result of its own policies.
Before Fidel Castro came to power in 1959, Cuba's economy was heavily reliant on the United States, which bought the bulk of its main export, sugar. American tourists flocked to the island, lured by its proximity, tropical weather and raucous night life.
After the overthrow of Fulgencio Batista, an authoritarian leader who had protected American commercial interests on the island, Fidel Castro's government asserted control over virtually every segment of the economy. It seized land and assets from American companies and vowed to guarantee all citizens housing, health care and education. Communism brought an ever more anemic and backward economy, one propped up largely by Moscow. But after the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, so did Cuba's economy.
Cubans euphemistically call the stark deprivation of the 1990s the "special period," a time when the Cuban government was forced to allow in some foreign investment and authorize limited private-sector employment. In 1999, Havana found a new benefactor in the newly elected president of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez -- which gave Cuban officials the ability to retighten state control of the economy. But in the last two years Venezuela, which provides heavily subsidized oil to Cuba in exchange for medical services, has struggled with a worsening economic and political crisis, which could force it to cut off subsidies to Havana.
The precariousness of that relationship has added urgency to the debate over how fast the Cuban government needs to implement the reforms Raúl Castro endorsed. Old-guard leaders warn that a liberalized market economy could turn Cuba into a less egalitarian society and provide an opening for the United States to destabilize the government through a flood of private investment. Reformists, including some of the country's leading economists, say the current state of the economy is untenable.
The reality is that the island's social welfare achievements cannot be sustained if current economic and demographic trends hold. Cuba is currently ranked in the top tier of the United Nations Human Development Index, a measure of a country's education level, life expectancy and other variables. That's an achievement matched by only two other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, Argentina and Chile.
Wages in Cuba are worth roughly 28 percent of what they were before the collapse of the Soviet Union, according to the Center for the Study of the Cuban Economy at the state-run University of Havana. The devaluation has turned workplace theft into a major problem. It has also led tens of thousands of Cuban professionals to emigrate to the United States and elsewhere in Latin America in recent years in search of a better life. The country's birthrate is declining, while its elderly are living longer.
The agricultural sector remains stymied by outdated technology and byzantine policies. A foreign investment law Cuba's National Assembly approved in March has yet to deliver a single deal. Adding to the challenges, the Cuban government has pledged to do away soon with its dual-currency system (which includes a dollar-pegged peso established in the 1990s when tourism opened up), a process that could drive up inflation. Yet against the picture of stagnation is the growth of a new class of private-sector employees, now nearly 500,000 strong. That's not a huge number in a nation of 11 million, but they are a marvel of ingenuity in a place where running a private restaurant requires buying virtually all ingredients on the black market. Basic staples, like potatoes, must be purchased as contraband in Cuba.
Many of those building small businesses, such as bed-and-breakfasts, are Cubans who returned with savings earned abroad and those with relatives outside the country who provided start-up capital. All struggle with the bureaucracy, since they are unable to import legally items as basic as mattresses and pillows. Bringing items from the United States is onerous and complicated by American sanctions. Cuban authorities appear conflicted about the growing private sector. While they welcome the employment and tax revenue it generates, bureaucrats are throttling businesses that are doing particularly well and forcing some to become joint ventures with the state. The underlying message seems to be: We want prosperity but not overly prosperous individuals.
Washington could empower the reformist camp by making it easier for Cuban entrepreneurs to get external financing and business training. That type of engagement is unlikely to succeed unless the United States abandons its policy of regime change. Cuba's economic transformation may be proceeding slowly, but it could well lead to a more open society. For now, continued antagonism from Washington is only helping the old guard.

Full text:   Philip K. Dick's "The Man in the High Castle" is about what the title character calls the "terribly, terribly disruptive" nature of reality, so it is awesome that the terribly, terribly disruptive Amazon has now filmed this classic science fiction tale. The pilot will appear early next year from Amazon Studios. Any member of the Amazon Prime perks club can watch it free.
Nothing in life is truly free, of course, even from Internet companies that proclaim their generosity. As Amazon loads the benefits on top of Prime -- including costly original programming like "High Castle," older movies, a streaming music service and an e-book lending library -- the conventional wisdom is that these customers will return the favor by ordering much more from Amazon. Come for the movie, stay for the vacuum cleaner, diapers and marmalade.
But there is another, more hidden group paying for "High Castle": people who buy physical books on Amazon. The retailer's expansion of Prime benefits, as well as its myriad other projects, appears to be fueled in part by fattened margins on all sorts of books beyond the top best sellers.
Say, for instance, "High Castle" is terrific and you wanted to read something else by Mr. Dick. There are quite a few novels to choose from and Amazon has them all. But the deals are often less than compelling.
"Dr. Bloodmoney," "Confessions of a Crap Artist," "In Milton Lumky Territory," "The Penultimate Truth," "Time Out of Joint," "A Scanner Darkly" and 15 other Dick novels were all discounted 10 to 17 percent late last week. A collection of short stories, "The Best of Philip K. Dick," was discounted all of 1 percent. The standard biography of Mr. Dick was discounted 15 percent. Another collection of stories was only 6 percent off.
These are not the sort of bargains that made Amazon into the biggest bookseller in the world. In 2001, the retailer announced with much fanfare that it would discount by 30 percent books selling for $20 or more.
Sales boomed. "It's Adam Smith economics that volume will go up when prices go down," Amazon's chief executive, Jeff Bezos, explained to The New York Times in January 2002.
Mr. Bezos added that Amazon, which was then offering free shipping on orders over $99, would continue to cut prices as its efficiency increased. That year, Amazon lowered the bar for a 30 percent discount to $15. Shipping soon became an even better deal. Traditional bookstores, which had to charge sales tax while Amazon did not, simply could not compete. Borders went out of business.
Then the process went into reverse. Although Amazon does not reveal its pricing strategy, that blanket 30 percent discount seems a thing of the past. Customers today also pay sales tax in much of the United States, which equates to a price increase of as much as 9 percent.
Mr. Bezos is apparently now using a different measuring stick than Adam Smith economics. Books are helping pay for the company's expansion, he suggested in an interview this month at a conference hosted by Business Insider, a website he has invested in.
"It's like we built this lemonade stand 20 years ago," he said. "It's become very profitable over time, but we also decided to use our skills to open a hamburger stand and a hot-dog stand and so on."
"Very profitable"? That does not sound good for the customers. An Amazon spokesman did not return requests for comment.
Shmuli Goldberg of Feedvisor, a start-up that helps third-party sellers on Amazon price their goods competitively, said ever-cheaper books were too much to expect.
"The promise of the Internet was never that you can get everything available for cheap," he said. "The promise of the Internet was that you could find what you were looking for. Anything that has a limited supply and a limited distribution is going to be more expensive than something that could be bought anywhere."
That would explain why the more obscure the books are, the more the discount seems to disappear. "A Publisher's Paradise: Expatriate Literary Culture in Paris, 1890-1960" is discounted 5 percent. "The Fate of Rural Hell: Asceticism and Desire in Buddhist Thailand" is discounted 7 percent.
If Amazon seems to have changed its business practices, its message is still the same. It talks the way it did a decade ago, when it was still relentlessly driving down prices. In the confrontation with the publisher Hachette over e-books last summer, the retailer made the crowd-pleasing point that it was on the side of readers against the fat-cat publishers that wanted to line their pockets.
In the Business Insider interview, Mr. Bezos repeated this argument. "Books don't just compete against books," he said. "Books compete against people reading blogs and news articles and playing video games and watching TV and going to see movies." He added, "Books, in my view, are too expensive. Thirty dollars for a book is too expensive."
Then why, for instance, is Gene Wolfe's ghost story "Peace," which the writer Neil Gaiman calls "a tricky, evil, deep, and remarkable novel by one of America's finest writers," $14.16 -- a mere 11 percent discount? Amazon usually gets a 50 percent discount from big publishers, which means it paid about $8 for each copy. Wouldn't it move more copies out the door (Amazon says it has 7 on hand) with a leaner margin?
The publishers are not blameless here. List prices of books seem to have been going up more than the rate of inflation. Perhaps one reason is that publishers knew Amazon would heavily discount them. Now that those deep discounts are less ubiquitous, books are expensive indeed.
Mr. Goldberg of Feedvisor said he believed that Amazon may have higher prices than other retailers overall. "Their goal is, and always has been, to deliver a superior shopping experience to their customers by providing both an excellent customer experience and highly competitive pricing," he said. "They are not always looking to be the cheapest, but to maximize the complete value."
A recent study from Wells Fargo found that Walmart's online prices were 10 percent lower than Amazon's in four big categories: clothing, electronics, housewares and health and cosmetics. This brought a furious denial from Amazon. Wells says it is reviewing the data.
One way for book buyers to receive higher value on Amazon is to buy what Amazon wants to sell you instead of what you thought you wanted. Among all those Philip K. Dick novels, I saw two that were heavily discounted: "The Man in the High Castle," which serves as a promotional tool for the coming film, and "Ubik," which asks the question, What happens when technology begins working against you? The hero cannot leave his apartment because he has no money to pay off the front door, so it refuses to open for him.
Amazon is clearly the best system ever devised for having physical texts delivered efficiently. But it looks as if the less mainstream your selection, the more you will have to pay. That seems unfortunate in all sorts of ways.

Full text:   Most of us don't add up the short-run investment pros and cons when we consider whether to buy a house; instead, we think about the long-term lifestyle we want.
That makes sense, because once a house is bought, the owner typically stays in it for a decade or more. And, after all, houses are homes as well as investments.
Yet at important points in our lives, we may nonetheless find ourselves focusing on the investment side of housing. Do we want the largest houses we can afford, or should we live modestly -- maybe by renting -- and invest more money elsewhere?
In making that decision, we'd benefit by knowing what would happen to a home's value in 10, 20 or 30 years. Unfortunately, short-run changes in home prices are of virtually no value in answering this question. The best we can do is assess recent trends, and look further back into history.
So here's an update on housing trends, compared with those of earlier years. Or, more precisely, here's an update on what people think the trends will be. Despite having no objective way to know the future -- and despite an apparent disregard for the reality that housing hasn't been a great investment over the long run -- people are constantly changing their opinions about long-term trends. And, lately, they've become somewhat more optimistic.
Karl Case of Wellesley College and I have conducted an annual questionnaire survey of recent home buyers in the Los Angeles, San Francisco, Milwaukee and Boston areas since 2003. Since 2012, Anne Thompson of Dodge Data & Analytics has participated. Each year, our survey has asked: "On average over the next 10 years, how much do you expect the value of your property to change each year?" In 2004, a boom year, the average answer was a gain of 12.6 percent, but in succeeding years the figure began to decline, bottoming at 4 percent in 2012. The expected gain rose to 4.2 percent in 2013 and 5.5 percent in mid-2014.
In addition, the Pulsenomics U.S. Housing Confidence Survey, covering the entire country (and involving many cities that may be less volatile than our four), showed that homeowners and renters in July had slightly lower 10-year expectations: 4 percent a year for the next 10 years.
Still another measure of expectations can be found in the United States composite home price index futures contract on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. At its close on Nov. 30, the contract predicted a 4 percent-a-year increase from November 2014 to November 2016.
These three reports are fairly consistent, and both our data and that of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange show higher expectations than they did a couple years ago. But these new expectations are hardly wild: If inflation ran at 2 percent a year, the Federal Reserve's target, the expected appreciation in housing would be an inflation-corrected 2 percent to 3.5 percent a year. So at the moment, there is no evidence of extravagant bubble thinking.
Another way of looking at this is to compare mortgage rates with expectations for housing prices. Mortgage rates are low, only 3.93 percent for the 30-year conventional mortgage in early December, according to Freddie Mac's latest report. Thus, the spread between 10-year expectations for housing prices and this mortgage rate is now very small. Contrast that with a spread of more than six percentage points in the home-price bubble just before the market peak of 2006.
Understandably, people back then were excited to think they could borrow 90 percent or more of a home's value at around 6 percent interest and receive an annualized return of more than 12 percent. That would have been quite a coup. But those expectations were about as wrong as wrong could be. People were living in a bubble, and the bubble eventually burst. Expectations are rising again, but this is nothing like the run-up to the 2006 peak.
One wild card in housing prices is the future of the mortgage interest tax deduction. While it's beloved by many taxpayers, it may not last -- and if it doesn't, short-term trends could be affected.
Dennis J. Ventry Jr., a professor at the School of Law at the University of California, Davis, calls the mortgage tax break "the accidental deduction," put in place largely to help farmers, when there were more farmers than homeowners with mortgages. Back then, there was little if any discussion of the idea that the government should subsidize homeownership. An accidental tax break like this might well be repealed someday. A proposal in February by Representative Dave Camp, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, to limit a couple's deduction to the interest on $500,000 of mortgage principal, is an indicator of what may be ahead.
But if you're thinking for the long term, this shouldn't be a major concern. With mortgage rates under 4 percent, and with the median home price under $200,000, according to RealtyTrac, the typical mortgage interest deduction is well under $8,000 a year, far below the 2015 standard income tax deduction of $12,600 for a married couple. Only about 30 percent of taxpayers itemize deductions, and unless you do so, you can't get this mortgage break.
Edward Glaeser of Harvard and Jesse Shapiro of the University of Chicago found that the homeownership deduction has accrued overwhelmingly to people in the top tenth of the income distribution. What's more, the deduction hasn't figured significantly in home-price surges. The biggest housing boom in American history, from 1996 to 2006, came after the decline in overall inflation since 1980 had already made the mortgage deduction much less valuable than it was in previous years. So far, we've been talking about objective issues. But changes in our speculative mentality -- the driver of all those long-term expectations for price changes -- are likely to be much more important, because expectations can feed a self-fulfilling prophecy until a bubble bursts.
Ten years from now, there could be another housing boom or bust. But since 1890, the average appreciation of inflation-corrected home prices in the United States has been only a third of 1 percent a year. That's why housing hasn't been a great investment. And in 10 years, it may be almost equally likely that real home prices will be higher or lower than they are today.
Cultural changes -- like those brought by the Internet -- could also have a profound effect. When our social contacts are increasingly defined by social media, for example, the appeal of living in a permanent physical neighborhood could decline. We don't really know. This is more sociology than economics.
In making the crucial choice of how much housing to buy for the long haul, we must keep in mind that owner-occupied homes aren't a surefire investment opportunity. You may want to weigh whether you want to deal with a home's maintenance, or whether you're committed to staying in one neighborhood and, maybe, at a nearby job. Those factors may be a source of pleasure -- or a burden -- over the next decade. In any case, there's a good chance they will outweigh the financial prospects of an investment in housing.

Full text:   TEHRAN -- The text message, received as the deadline for nuclear talks was expiring, gave Fatemeh Moghimi a thrill she had been waiting years to feel. "The deal," it read, "was done."
It took Ms. Moghimi, the owner of a leading trucking company, a second to absorb the news. When she did, she recalled recently in her Tehran office, she fairly screamed to herself, "We're in business!"
As it turned out, the message was a bad joke, and instead the nuclear negotiations were extended for seven more months -- bad news for Iran's battered, inflation-ridden economy. But Ms. Moghimi was unfazed. "I'm not giving up hope," she said with a smile. "It is going to be over soon. It is as if the sun is peeking through the clouds after a terrible rainstorm."
Ms. Moghimi's unyielding optimism, shared by many top businesspeople here, was dented briefly last month when nuclear negotiators agreed to a second extension of the talks without even a framework for further negotiations. But it is almost an article of faith in business circles that the latest extension is only the postponement of an inevitable thaw between Iran and the rest of the world.
"The world needs this deal; we need this deal," Ms. Moghimi said. "It will happen."
Both moderates and conservatives have expressed concerns about the unchecked rise in expectations, among the public as well as among elite business classes, that a deal will be cinched. They have been warning that the enthusiasm could turn to bitter disappointment if the negotiations, set to resume in Geneva next week, should fail, possibly touching off unrest or what some clerics call "another sedition," a reference to the revolt that followed disputed presidential elections in 2009.
"The prospect of a better future is enough to make them forget their problems for now," said Farshad Ghorbanpour, a political analyst. "Later, we will see if that state of mind will prove to be costly for us."
The confidence is beginning to take on a life of its own, with executives in the major export industries -- oil and gas, transportation and carpets -- feverishly preparing for what they envision as gloriously prosperous days ahead. Meeting with foreign businesspeople at the conferences that are springing up regularly in Tehran, they are knocking out memorandums of understanding and other nonbinding agreements and even some contracts -- all with caveats saying sanctions must be lifted first.
"I have signed contracts with Europeans and Arabs to design five refineries," said Mohammad Javad Hassannejad, the chief executive of an oil and gas consultancy, Petrosadian. He said the contracts were potentially worth many millions of dollars for his company and would inject billions of dollars into the stagnant Iranian economy.
"Spirits are high," he said. "There is growing confidence. After the deal we will witness an unbelievable boom."
In the coming months Tehran's Chamber of Commerce is organizing an international conference for foreign investors, Ms. Moghimi explained between phone calls, sitting behind her desk.
"We will inform them where and how foreigners can invest, and help them to come to Iran," she said. "All of us here are ready to start working."
When Ms. Moghimi thinks of Iran's future she sees a thriving nation at the heart of the crossroads between Asia, Europe and the Middle East. Her fleet of trucks will grow beyond imagination, she said, and she predicted that foreign companies would choose not the glitter of Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, but the future boomtown Tehran for their regional headquarters.
"We should start preparing now," she said in her Tehran office, where framed certificates and awards line the walls. "That way we will be ready once there is an end to the sanctions."
The wave of optimism began with the election of a moderate president, Hassan Rouhani, who promised to mend Iran's ties with the world. Mr. Rouhani continues to encourage that thinking, saying just last week that the "nuclear issue would be brought to its destination." His foreign minister and chief nuclear negotiator, Mohammad Javad Zarif, promised after the most recent extension that a nuclear deal could happen "within weeks."
The heightened expectations are not solely to be found among Iranians. The flow of foreign delegations to Iran continues at a steady pace, bringing eager businessmen who in conferences laud Iran's unique geographical position, its stability and its largely untapped market of middle-class consumers.
At one such conference recently, staring into a huge auditorium filled with proudly smiling Iranian car industry representatives, a French executive acknowledged that the potential for business with Iran was stunning indeed. He and the others had just viewed a 3-D movie showing workers in blue overalls manning robots in the Iran Khodro factory, which churns out hundreds of thousands of cars each year.
"The sooner we can start working together, the better," said the executive, Arnaud de David-Beauregards. He added, almost wistfully, "We hope our dear colleagues will wait for us."
Iran's national carmaker, partly state owned, feels like the cutest girl in the bar. The industry is being showcased by the Iranian government as a symbol of Iranian potential, a treasure to be sold off to the highest-bidding foreign partner.
Even though sanctions have cut the carmaker's production by 40 percent compared with its peak year of 2011, when it made 1.6 million, hopes are soaring. "We are planning our future irrespective of any deadline," said Hashem Yekehzare, the president of Iran Khodro, while making his way through a swarm of journalists.
For over a decade his company had partnered with the French automaker PSA Peugeot Citroën under a deal worth more than $2.5 billion a year, but the French were forced to pull out in 2012 because of the American-led sanctions.
They are eager to return, but Mr. Yekehzare said the company now had a bevy of suitors to choose from. "General Motors, Ford, all big American carmakers are showing interest in cooperating with us," he said. "Our future is bright."
The optimism about the future stands in stark contrast to the grim reality of Iran's deepening economic plight. A 40 percent drop in oil prices is forcing the government to start making cuts in popular subsidies and other government programs.
On Tuesday, for example, the price of bread, one of the country's most important subsidized staples, was raised by 30 percent. On Wednesday, the Fars news agency reported that the government had quietly begun phasing out monthly cash handouts of roughly $11 per person to some groups of Iranians.
Even the battered local currency, the rial, which the government props up, was allowed to fall by 8 percent recently, before recovering slightly.
For the most part, Iranians are sloughing off the bad news. What if the nuclear negotiations fail and sanctions are continued, or even toughened further? "In that case I will be very depressed," Ms. Moghimi said. "But I really have the feeling that will not happen."
The continuing support for the nuclear talks from Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is a beacon of hope for many in Iran's private sector. "The leader of the revolution would not be backing a failing project," Mr. Hassannejad, the oil and gas consultant, said in his office. He said he had already made a round of hires in recent months in anticipation of a deal -- and a subsequent wave of work. "The past years have been really difficult," he said. "The quicker the talks end, the sooner we can start."
Outside of the automotive conference hall, at the base of Tehran's 1,300-foot Milad Tower, Iranians gazed at the latest car models from Iran Khodro. An investor, Massoud Ranajee, said he too was optimistic. "But to be honest I have sold all my shares in this company," he said of Iran Khodro. "If they sign a deal with a foreign company, I might consider buying, but for now, it's all way too risky and uncertain."

Abstract: The department said that drilling activity in North Dakota, a main driver of the surging domestic oil production of recent years, has "not slowed, despite the significant decline in domestic crude oil prices since July 2014," according to the most recent data released by North Dakota regulators.

Full text:   Oil prices continued their collapse on Friday as evidence mounted that the frenzy of American oil production would continue well into 2015 even while growth in global demand was declining.
The swoon in oil prices led to a steep decline in equities, with the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closing lower by 1.6 percent, to 2,002.33, as investors feared that the declining energy demand meant that the global economy was slowing.
"People are scared that the drop in oil demand is the first leg down for the global economy that had been led by the growth in the emerging markets," said Nancy T. Schmitt, president of Taum Sauk Investments. "That growth has evaporated. The demand has gone away, and we are seeing it first with oil prices."
The global benchmark for crude approached $60 a barrel -- down more than 3 percent on the day and roughly 45 percent since the summer. And the American benchmark continued its free fall as well, to below $58 a barrel, down around 4 percent. A day earlier, it sagged below $60 a barrel in the United States for the first time since 2009.
The new rout began Friday morning after the International Energy Agency, the organization based in Paris that advises industrial countries, cut its forecast for global demand for crude oil in 2015 by 230,000 barrels a day. The agency cited less oil consumption in countries that produce it like Russia and a weaker-than-expected global economy.
A trim of 230,000 barrels a day is minimal in a global market of about 93 million barrels a day. But the lower forecast, the fourth by the agency in the last five months, reinforced the sentiment that supply will most likely exceed demand substantially next year.
The Energy Department also issued a report later in the day predicting that American oil production would average 9.3 million barrels a day in 2015, 700,000 barrels more than this year. That is a small downward revision of production previously predicted by the department, but its report emphasized that "all the decrease in forecast production growth comes in the second half of 2015."
The department said that drilling activity in North Dakota, a main driver of the surging domestic oil production of recent years, has "not slowed, despite the significant decline in domestic crude oil prices since July 2014," according to the most recent data released by North Dakota regulators.
The result was a near capitulation in the market for oil.
"In the very short term prices can go lower; the market is weighted to very bearish sentiment," said Richard Mallinson, an analyst at Energy Aspects, a research firm based in London.
But even with the recent plunge, oil prices still have not approached the lows of recent decades. For example, oil briefly broke below $10 a barrel in 1986, which equates to about $21 today after adjusting for inflation.
At least in the short term, the declines are good news for American drivers about to take vacations or visit their families and friends for the holidays.
"Gas prices will continue to be in a free fall as long as crude oil is searching for a bottom," the AAA motor club reported on Friday.
Nationally, the average price for a gallon of regular gasoline fell 2 cents on Friday to $2.60, 11 cents below its price a week ago, according to AAA. Drivers on average are paying $1.10 a gallon less than they paid on April 28, the high point for the year in gas prices.
"Many drivers are spending $15 to $30 less per trip to the gas station compared to what they paid during this year's highs," the motor club said.
New York is the only state in the continental United States with an average above $3 a gallon, the motor club said, but at $3.02, "the average should drop below that mark within a few days."
Analysts say a major cut in global production would be needed next year to avoid an inventory buildup and to stabilize falling prices. But the prospect of a supply cut was dashed last month when the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries declined to change its output ceilings at a meeting in Vienna.
A test of strength appears to be occurring among the Saudis and their equally prosperous Gulf allies, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, and other producers like Venezuela and Iran, which can much less easily afford a long bout of low prices. Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the U.A.E. have about $1.5 trillion in financial assets among them, which is "plenty to meet their spending needs for the next few years," said Rachel Ziemba, an analyst at Roubini Global Economics in London.
At the same time, Venezuela, Nigeria and other producers are "going to have to cut back on spending," Ms. Ziemba said. Already, Venezuelan officials have said it may be necessary to call an emergency OPEC meeting if the price rout continues.
The Saudis and their allies argue that to cut production now to raise prices would be to subsidize competitors like the companies extracting oil from shale in the United States, which are responsible for recent big additions to world oil supplies.

Abstract: The government has pumped credit into the economy to raise inflation, weaken the yen and help exporters, but as a result, households have less purchasing power. The Democratic Party of Japan, now in opposition, won a landslide victory in 2009 by proposing to replace lavish public works spending with a strong, Scandinavian-style social safety net that would, in turn, stimulate private consumption.

Full text:   TOKYO -- THE Japanese have a term for hopelessness -- shikata ga nai, "it can't be helped." Acceptance of things as they are is deeply embedded in the culture. It also explains why voters are so listless, and even despairing, in the run-up to the national election on Sunday.
Japan is in a recession. The popularity of the Liberal Democratic Party, which has been in power for all but four years since 1955, is plummeting. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called an early election to pre-empt the coalescing of an opposition that could threaten his party's control of Parliament.
Mr. Abe says he wants to revive the long-stagnant economy, but his policies have been anything but clear. The government has pumped credit into the economy to raise inflation, weaken the yen and help exporters, but as a result, households have less purchasing power. It has borrowed heavily to finance infrastructure and other stimulus projects, but it has also raised the national sales tax, which sent the economy into a downturn. It wants to make it easier for companies to lay off employees, but it hasn't found a new way to offer them the economic security they have long expected.
Voters are so dispirited that turnout could be at a record low. Yet the Liberal Democratic Party is expected to hold on -- an unfortunate outcome for Japan.
Mr. Abe's real objectives go beyond reviving the economy. He has moved to stack the leadership of NHK, the state broadcaster, with nationalist supporters. In flagrant violation of the pacifist Constitution, his cabinet decreed that Japan's military would participate in "collective defense measures" overseas. His government is intent on rewriting the nation's history of wartime atrocities.
These measures are unpopular, but Japanese voters have been apathetic toward them. A big reason is Japan's history with the United States. For nearly 70 years, Japanese elites have been convinced that America was an essential bulwark against, first, Soviet Communism, and now an expansionist China. American meddling has hindered the development of a progressive political vision and helped the Liberal Democratic Party stay in power.
Japan's economic problems result in part from the breakdown of the postwar social compact. To appease restive workers in the 1950s and '60s, successive governments, including one led by Mr. Abe's grandfather Nobosuke Kishi, persuaded corporations to guarantee job security.
For 25 years, this arrangement worked. With meticulous attention to quality, an undervalued currency and comparatively low costs for labor, financing, transportation and supplies, Japanese companies took market share from Western competitors.
But once Japan clawed its way to the cutting edge of industrial development, it couldn't figure out what to do next -- a particular danger in a risk-averse culture. The authorities first tried to focus on investments rather than exports; the result was a property and financial mania, followed by a crash in the early 1990s. The economy at last began to revive during the 2001-06 administration of Junichiro Koizumi, thanks largely to demand from Chinese industrialists for Japanese equipment. Then came the global financial crisis, which made clear once and for all that Japanese companies could no longer provide for people's economic security. The labor agreements of the postwar decades, when lots of young workers were willing to trade modest paychecks today for economic security tomorrow, are no longer tenable.
The Democratic Party of Japan, now in opposition, won a landslide victory in 2009 by proposing to replace lavish public works spending with a strong, Scandinavian-style social safety net that would, in turn, stimulate private consumption. Sadly, three events destroyed the D.P.J. government. The first was a plan to move a United States Marine base in Okinawa to a less populated part of the island (instead of moving it off the island altogether). The second was a proposed sales-tax increase, favored by the powerful Finance Ministry, which can bully prime ministers into submission. The third was the earthquake and tsunami of 2011, which destroyed the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant.
In 2012, the D.P.J. was voted out. Mr. Abe came in and carried out the sales-tax increase, against economists' advice.
Culture doesn't explain everything, but the Japanese reluctance to acknowledge contradictions -- to act as if everything were the way it should be, even when it isn't -- helps explain the stasis of recent decades. The sense of living in a world where things happen for inexplicable reasons -- in which the most one can do is adapt as best one can, while giving one's all -- is pervasive.
An Abe victory could mean reduced pension benefits, more regressive taxes, more public spending that benefits the corporate and bureaucratic oligarchy, and more poorly paid temporary work. The men who seek to carry out this program will not cackle with glee like Wall Street bankers; they will bow low with long faces, persuaded that they are participating in a general sacrifice over which they have no choice.
And they are likely to get away with it because millions of Japanese will shrug their shoulders at the sclerosis of their political system and the unremitting power of Japan's bureaucracies and corporations. After all, it can't be helped.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text:   FRANKFURT -- Banks showed only moderate interest on Thursday in a second round of cheap loans that the European Central Bank is offering in hopes of restoring commercial bank lending and combating low inflation.
The response is likely to reinforce expectations that the central bank will soon have no choice but to begin large-scale asset purchases to pump money into the flagging eurozone economy.
The loans are part of a broader effort by the central bank to inject as much as 1 trillion euros into the eurozone economy and to reverse a decline in inflation. The borrowing data is being closely watched as an indicator of whether the central bank would be able to meet its goal.
But banks took [EUR]130 billion, or about $161 billion, in loans from the central bank, which offered a fixed interest rate of 0.15 percent for four years. In the first round of loans in September, banks borrowed [EUR]82.6 billion. In all, European banks have tapped only about half the available money since the cheap loans were first offered in September.
Interest by banks in the cheap cash was "perhaps not as bad as some had feared, but probably much lower than the E.C.B. had hoped," Martin van Vliet, an economist at ING Bank, wrote in a note to clients. The result "further shortens the odds," he said, that the central bank will begin so-called quantitative easing -- large-scale asset purchases to inject money into the financial system.
The latest inflation data on Thursday only adds to that pressure. In France, consumer prices fell at an annual rate of 0.2 percent in November. The figure is likely to heighten fears that very low inflation is becoming entrenched, trapping the eurozone in long-term stagnation similar to the kind that has afflicted Japan since the 1990s.
Quantitative easing is an approach the United States Federal Reserve and the Bank of England have both employed. Such stimulus has helped the American and British economies fare better in recent years than the eurozone's.
So far, the E.C.B. has chosen not to take that route, in part because of opposition from some eurozone countries, including Germany. The European Central Bank's president, Mario Draghi, has said for months that the central bank wants to gauge the effect of stimulus efforts already in place -- like the cheap bank loans -- before taking more aggressive steps.
The central bank cash is intended to drive down the cost of borrowing and encourage lending, especially in countries like Italy and Portugal, where a lack of credit has impeded economic growth. Banks that take advantage of the central bank's loans must show that they are using the money to increase lending to households and businesses.
The drawback of the European Central Bank's strategy is that it is dependent on whether banks want the money. Large-scale asset purchases, on the other hand, are a way of effectively printing money regardless of bank behavior.
Given the continuing reluctance of banks to lend even when the central bank is offering them money at close to zero interest, the central bank may have no choice but to step up asset purchases by buying government bonds.
The central bank, in a separate program, has already been buying packages of bank loans known as covered bonds or asset-backed securities. The volume, about [EUR]21.5 billion, has been small because the supply of such private sector assets is limited. And it remains far short of the E.C.B's goal to buy assets of [EUR]1 trillion goal.
Some analysts predict the central bank will announce a government bond buying program at its next meeting on Jan. 22. Others expect the central bank to wait until March or later, in hopes that the eurozone economy will recover and inflation will rise.

Full text:   The Bank of England announced a sweeping set of changes on Thursday to increase transparency in how it operates and how it discloses the decisions it makes.
Starting next year, the British central bank said it would publish the minutes of its monetary policy meetings and its inflation report at the same time the decisions are announced, eliminating the current two-week delay. The changes, some of which require legislation, are expected to give more timely information to the financial markets.
And beginning in March, recordings of the meetings at which monetary policy decisions are made will no longer be deleted, and transcripts will be published with an eight-year lag. The bank will also trim its schedule of 12 meetings a year to eight, similar to the United States Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank in Frankfurt.
The changes reflect the broad authority that central banks have acquired in recent years, and the accountability that many policy makers believe should accompany that expanded power.
"Transparency is the watchword for monetary policy, and greater openness the hallmark of the modern central bank," said Kevin M. Warsh, a member of the Fed's board of governors from 2006 to 2011 who undertook a study for the Bank of England into its transparency practices.
Analysts welcomed the moves.
"By publishing the minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meetings at the same time as the policy decision is made should allow analysts and the markets to make more informed views of the Bank of England's action and where policy is likely headed," said Howard Archer, chief economist for Britain and Europe at IHS Global Insight. He said this should help to limit "the risk of potentially damaging market swings that can occur when a policy decision" is made but the reasons behind the decision are not known until weeks later.
As part of the bank's 2014 strategic review, its governors had expressed a desire to improve its transparency. In April, the bank asked Mr. Warsh to examine the Monetary Policy Committee's practices and procedures with an eye to accountability and disclosure.
Part of the reason for the study is the growing remit of the bank. The Monetary Policy Committee's job is to maintain price stability, keep inflation low and support the British government's economic objectives, including those for growth and employment, the Warsh report said.
But in recent years that authority has grown immensely. The Financial Services Act in 2012 gave the central bank responsibility for oversight of the British financial system, establishing the bank's Financial Policy Committee and setting up a new regulator, the Prudential Regulation Authority.
"The bank now has immense responsibilities for monetary stability, financial stability and for microprudential regulation," Mark J. Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, said on Thursday. "And with these responsibilities comes the need for effective transparency, genuine accountability and robust governance."
The changes come as the bank's relationship with some of those it regulates is being scrutinized.
In November, as major lenders agreed to pay $4.3 billion to British, American and Swiss regulators to settle charges that they manipulated the foreign exchange market, the Bank of England released its own investigation into what it knew about what was happening in the markets.
That report showed that a few officials at the British central bank were aware of the activity that regulators later deemed misconduct. Martin Mallett, then the Bank of England's chief currencies dealer, expressed concerns as far back as 2008 about "manipulation" but did not take those concerns to his superiors, according to documents released by the bank. Mr. Mallett was dismissed for reasons unrelated to the inquiry, according to the bank.
Mr. Warsh recommended that the Bank of England adopt overhauls with four main objectives: making sound policy decisions; communicating judgments effectively; ensuring accountability for its actions; and creating a fair and accurate historical record.
Other changes the bank added would alter the governance of the Financial Policy Committee and of the Prudential Regulation Authority.
During 2015, the bank's board will publish its minutes from meetings between 1914 and 1987, aligning its archival procedures with those of the broader British government. Next month, the bank will release a redacted form of the minutes from the board meetings and from related meetings during the crisis period of 2007 to 2009.
George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, sounded his support for the changes, saying he would consider the bank's proposals in full "early in the next Parliament as part of a postlegislative review of the Financial Services Act 2012."

Full text:   The Greek fiscal crisis erupted five years ago, and its side effects continue to inflict immense damage on Europe and the world. But I'm not talking about the side effects you may have in mind -- spillovers from Greece's Great Depression-level slump, or financial contagion to other debtors. No, the truly disastrous effect of the Greek crisis was the way it distorted economic policy, as supposedly serious people around the world rushed to learn the wrong lessons.
Now Greece appears to be in crisis again. Will we learn the right lessons this time?
What happened last time, you may recall, was the exploitation of Greece's woes to change the economic subject. Suddenly, we were supposed to obsess over budget deficits, even if borrowing costs were at historic lows, and slash government spending, even in the face of mass unemployment. Because if we didn't, you see, we could turn into Greece any day now. "Greece stands as a warning of what happens to countries that lose their credibility," intoned David Cameron, Britain's prime minister, as he announced austerity policies in 2010. "We are on the same path as Greece," declared Representative Paul Ryan, who was soon to become the chairman of the House Budget Committee, that same year.
In reality, Britain and the United States, which borrow in their own currencies, were and are nothing like Greece. If you thought otherwise in 2010, by now year after year of incredibly low interest rates and low inflation should have convinced you. And the experience of Greece and other European countries that were forced into harsh austerity measures should also have convinced you that slashing spending in a depressed economy is a really bad idea if you can avoid it. This is true even in the supposed success stories -- Ireland, for example, is finally growing again, but it still has almost 11 percent unemployment, and twice that rate among young people.
And the devastation in Greece is awesome to behold. Some press reports I've seen seem to suggest that the country has been a malingerer, balking at the harsh measures its situation demands. In reality, it has made huge adjustments -- slashing public employment and compensation, cutting back social programs, raising taxes. If you want a sense of the scale of austerity, it would be as if the United States had introduced spending cuts and tax increases amounting to more than $1 trillion a year. Meanwhile, wages in the private sector have plunged. Yet a quarter of the Greek labor force, and half its young, remain unemployed.
Meanwhile, the debt situation has if anything gotten worse, with the ratio of public debt to G.D.P. at a record high -- mainly because of falling G.D.P., not rising debt -- and with the emergence of a big private debt problem, thanks to deflation and depression. There are some positives; the economy is growing a bit, finally, largely thanks to a revival of tourism. But, over all, it has been many years of suffering for very little reward.
The remarkable thing, given all that, has been the willingness of the Greek public to take it, to accept the claims of the political establishment that the pain is necessary and will eventually lead to recovery. And the news that has roiled Europe these past few days is that the Greeks may have reached their limit. The details are complex, but basically the current government is trying a fairly desperate political maneuver to put off a general election. And, if it fails, the likely winner in that election is Syriza, a party of the left that has demanded a renegotiation of the austerity program, which could lead to a confrontation with Germany and exit from the euro.
The important point here is that it's not just the Greeks who are mad as Hellas (their own name for their country) and aren't going to take it anymore. Look at France, where Marine Le Pen, the leader of the anti-immigrant National Front, outpolls mainstream candidates of both right and left. Look at Italy, where about half of voters support radical parties like the Northern League and the Five-Star Movement. Look at Britain, where both anti-immigrant politicians and Scottish separatists are threatening the political order.
It would be a terrible thing if any of these groups -- with the exception, surprisingly, of Syriza, which seems relatively benign -- were to come to power. But there's a reason they're on the rise. This is what happens when an elite claims the right to rule based on its supposed expertise, its understanding of what must be done -- then demonstrates both that it does not, in fact, know what it is doing, and that it is too ideologically rigid to learn from its mistakes.
I have no idea how events in Greece are about to turn out. But there's a real lesson in its political turmoil that's much more important than the false lesson too many took from its special fiscal woes.

Abstract: March 7, 1933 The world has experienced one financial crisis after another over the last few decades -- runaway inflation, the stock market crash of 1987, the East Asian crisis of the late 1990s, the popping of the dot-com bubble in the face of accounting scandals and, finally, the crisis that led to the Great Recession. The shadow banking system -- largely exempt from normal banking regulation -- filled the breach when interest rates rose above the levels that banks were allowed to pay.

Full text:   "There are good crises and there are bad crises. Every crisis breaks a deadlock and sets events in motion. It is either a disaster or an opportunity. A bad crisis is one in which no one has the power to make good use of the opportunity and therefore it ends in disaster. A good crisis is one in which the power and the will to seize the opportunity are in being. Out of such a crisis come solutions."
-- Walter Lippmann,
March 7, 1933
The world has experienced one financial crisis after another over the last few decades -- runaway inflation, the stock market crash of 1987, the East Asian crisis of the late 1990s, the popping of the dot-com bubble in the face of accounting scandals and, finally, the crisis that led to the Great Recession.
And yet, at least according to the stock market, these have been the golden years. Never have United States stock prices done so well during a 36-year period as they have since 1978.
That one fact is an indication that the world has, on balance, handled the crises well enough -- or at least that investors now believe that to be true. This column, which will conclude next week as I end a 26-year career at The New York Times, is an attempt to evaluate those crises and how they were sometimes misunderstood in ways that came back to haunt the world years later.
Inflation was the big crisis of the late 1970s, when I first began to write about markets and the economy. Its persistence discredited economists and governments. It drained faith in the American economy.
In 1979, Business Week published an article that was destined to become a classic example of how wrong journalists could be: "The Death of Equities," the cover proclaimed. "How inflation is destroying the stock market." Betting on continuing inflation, through gold and silver prices, became popular. Long-term bonds became known as "certificates of confiscation" because investors were sure to be losers. The upward march of oil prices was viewed as a sure thing.
Inflation was vanquished by Paul Volcker, who was appointed Federal Reserve chairman in 1979 and showed a single-minded determination to conquer it.
He did that largely by raising interest rates to levels previously unthinkable. Not since the Civil War -- when the country's very survival was in question -- had the federal government paid as much as 10 percent to borrow money. Before Mr. Volcker was through, the government would pay more than 15 percent, and there would be back-to-back recessions in the early 1980s.
Mr. Volcker was not tremendously popular at the time -- starting recessions is not a surefire strategy to improve poll ratings -- but in the aftermath he deservedly became a legend.
The crisis was solved. The stock market took off in late 1982, and interest rates soon began to fall.
But like many solutions, the victory created other problems. It helped to destroy the savings and loan business, which was based on taking in short-term deposits and lending out the money for 30-year mortgages. The shadow banking system -- largely exempt from normal banking regulation -- filled the breach when interest rates rose above the levels that banks were allowed to pay.
More than 20 years later, the world would have good reason to regret that so much financial activity was no longer regulated. But at the time, what was clear was that the central bank had solved a problem that the politicians were said to have created. Around the world, there was a trend to independence for central bankers, whose brilliance was taken for granted. Mr. Volcker's aura carried over to his successor, Alan Greenspan, who in his first days in office was confronted with a crisis that shook the world's financial markets. The great 1980s bull market came to an abrupt end on Oct. 19, 1987 -- known instantly as Black Monday -- when the Dow Jones industrial average lost 22 percent of its value in one day. The immediate reaction was fear that the crash signaled a new recession, or worse.
Mr. Greenspan responded by opening the monetary spigots, assuring that battered brokerage firms would have access to cash. There was no recession, and by late 1989 stock prices returned to setting records.
The lessons learned from that crisis were generally the wrong ones, or at least they turned out to be counterproductive. The first was that prompt monetary easing would rescue any situation. The Fed had not done that immediately after the 1929 crash, and disaster ensued. But it had done so in 1987, and all turned out fine. The central bank had saved the day.
For many investors, the lesson learned was that rapid declines in stock prices created buying opportunities. Regulators and investors might have done better to ponder why the crash had happened at all.
There had been speculation driving share prices to perhaps unsustainable levels, but that speculation had not been nearly as widespread as in 1929.
What had become different was the markets themselves. A primary cause of the decline was the widespread popularity of "portfolio insurance," an idea developed largely by academics at the University of California. The idea was that a money manager need not trouble himself -- in those days, there were few women managing large sums of money -- with worries that the market was becoming overheated.
Instead, managers could simply use stock index futures to reduce a portfolio's exposure to the stock market. If stock prices began to decline, selling some futures would reduce the risk. If they fell further, all the managers had to do was sell more futures. In that way nearly all the profits from the bull market could be protected.
That strategy assumed that the stock index futures market would remain liquid -- that someone else would buy the futures if panic struck. Instead, the futures exchange market makers who bought the first futures sold by the managers turned around and sold stocks to protect themselves. That drove prices down more and ignited more selling of futures. Everybody could not get out at the same time.
What might have been learned? That new regulatory mechanisms were needed. Markets were very different from even a few years earlier, involving products that were complicated and used primarily, if not exclusively, by large financial firms. Computers had become fast enough to automatically issue trade orders -- and had done so by pushing out orders to sell stock index futures even when it should have been clear those orders were only making the crisis worse.
Had that been learned, some of the disasters of recent years might have been averted, including the 2010 "flash crash," in which badly programmed computers combined with badly designed markets to drive some high-quality stocks down to $1 a share.
But what was learned was that the Fed could, and would, rescue Wall Street if markets got out of hand, and that it could be relied upon to do so. Mr. Greenspan became an oracle, one who preached the wisdom of markets while standing ready to clean up any messes they made. That became known as the "Greenspan put:" You could make money when prices rose and avoid severe losses because he would step in if they fell.
It carried the seeds of its own demise, but that would not become clear until 2008.

Full text:   FRANKFURT -- Karl Otto Pöhl, a former president of Germany's central bank, whose fixation on price stability remains the guiding principle of eurozone monetary policy, died on Tuesday. He was 85.
His death was announced by the Bundesbank, the German central bank, which said it could not provide details on the cause or location.
As vice president of the Bundesbank from 1977 to 1979 and president from 1980 to 1991, Mr. Pöhl helped establish the central bank as a fierce guardian of a stable Deutsche mark. "Inflation is like toothpaste," he said in 1980. "Once it's out, you can hardly get it back in again."
The European Central Bank, which took over control of monetary policy for Germany and other eurozone countries in 1999, was modeled on the Bundesbank. (Both are in Frankfurt.) Unlike that of the Federal Reserve in the United States, which aims for low unemployment as well as price stability, the European Central Bank's mandate requires it to focus on inflation above all else.
"Karl Otto Pöhl delivered proof that price stability and growth are, in times of great monetary policy challenges, not contradictory," Jens Weidmann, the president of the Bundesbank, said in a statement on Wednesday. "To this day, we in the European Monetary Union have much to thank him for."
Mr. Weidmann is the latest in a series of Bundesbank presidents who have defended Mr. Pöhl's precepts. Mr. Weidmann has been among the most vocal opponents of proposals for the bank to effectively print money to revive eurozone growth.
Mr. Pöhl was born in Hanover on Dec. 1, 1929, and earned a degree in economics in 1955. He worked as a journalist in Bonn, then the West German capital, before becoming the equivalent of an under secretary in the German Finance Ministry.
After leaving the Bundesbank in 1991, during discord with Chancellor Helmut Kohl about the decision to exchange East German marks for West German marks at a 1-to-1 ratio, Mr. Pöhl became chief executive of Sal. Oppenheim, a private bank in Cologne. He held that job from 1992 to 1998.
In the early 2000s Mr. Pöhl was also on the board of the United States private equity company the Carlyle Group.
Not surprisingly, Mr. Pöhl was a critic of the way eurozone leaders handled the debt crisis that began in 2010. In an interview with the German magazine Der Spiegel in 2010, he said a bailout of the nearly bankrupt Greek government was little more than a giveaway to wealthy Greeks and French banks with holdings in Greece. Mr. Pöhl favored allowing Greece to abandon the euro.
"Greece never should have been admitted to the eurozone," he told Der Spiegel.
Mr. Pöhl had four children from two marriages, according to Der Spiegel.

Full text:   Political groups independent of candidates spent more than $814 million to influence congressional elections last month, a record for the midterms and nearly twice the spending in 2010, Federal Election Commission records show.
The most obvious explanation for the rapid increase is the effect of the 2010 Citizens United decision by the Supreme Court and the rise in spending by super PACs, which can accept unlimited contributions from individuals, corporations and unions.
This year the groups jumped into Democratic efforts to maintain control of the Senate, and into the ultimately successful campaign by Republicans to retake it. The total includes Democratic and Republican party committees for House and Senate candidates, which are not permitted to coordinate with their candidates when making independent expenditures, but even excluding those four committees the amount ($605 million) would be a midterm record. It does not include groups, mostly nonprofits, that spend money to influence elections without explicitly calling for the election or defeat of a candidate.
The bulk of the reported 2014 independent spending -- at least $514 million -- came in Senate races, and that amount was nearly twice the $277 million that outside groups spent on Senate contests in 2010 (adjusted for inflation). That's far less than national, state and local party committees combine to spend during an election cycle, but it is growing closer to what Senate candidates spend. Although final numbers for this year's candidates are not yet available, in 2012 Senate candidates spent $773 million in 2014 dollars.
The Senate race in North Carolina, where Thom Tillis, a Republican, unseated Kay Hagan, the Democratic incumbent, had more than $82 million in reported independent expenditures between the primary and general elections. Outside groups reported spending more than $70 million on Colorado's Senate race as Cory Gardner, a Republican congressman, defeated Mark Udall, the Democratic incumbent.
As high as independent spending was in the battle for the Senate, it will undoubtedly soar in 2016, when a presidential contest is included. In 2012, overall independent spending reached more than $1.2 billion, more than four times the 2008 total.

Abstract: A recovering economy and rapidly falling oil prices have provided some breathing room for airlines in recent months, bolstering profits and allowing carriers to buy new planes or upgrade their higher-end service. The International Air Transport Association, an industry group based in Geneva, estimated that the industry's profits would grow 26 percent next year, to reach a record $25 billion, not adjusted for inflation.

Full text:   A recovering economy and rapidly falling oil prices have provided some breathing room for airlines in recent months, bolstering profits and allowing carriers to buy new planes or upgrade their higher-end service.
But while motorists have seen gasoline prices fall at the pump, air travelers should not expect to see fares, or even fuel surcharges, drop anytime soon.
Airlines were quick to slap extra fuel charges on their international flights when oil prices spiked a few years ago. Today, those can reach about $500 for a round-trip international flight, for instance, between Newark and Frankfurt, or Los Angeles and Tokyo. But with oil prices down more than 40 percent since June, airlines have been a lot slower in cutting back those surcharges, particularly at a time when they have no trouble filling planes at current fares.
Fuel accounts for nearly half an airline's costs. But airline executives are unsure where oil prices will settle or how sustained the downturn in the oil market will be. Alexandre de Juniac, the chairman of Air France-KLM, estimated that oil might hover between $70 and $80 a barrel next year, although he added, "Obviously, no one really knows."
"It's a reason that our fares probably won't be increased," he said. He noted that for European carriers, the drop in oil prices had been offset by the relative decline in the value of the euro against the dollar.
Oil futures for the American benchmark settled at $60.94 a barrel in New York on Wednesday, down 4.5 percent, their lowest level in more than five years. The drop has taken many experts by surprise. It was set off by sustained growth in domestic oil supplies in the United States along with a weak global economy.
This has translated into a windfall for the airlines.
The International Air Transport Association, an industry group based in Geneva, estimated that the industry's profits would grow 26 percent next year, to reach a record $25 billion, not adjusted for inflation. The group expects $19.9 billion in collective profits in 2014. In 2013, the industry had nearly $11 billion in profits.
"There's no doubt that the recent fall in the oil price is a relief for airlines," Tony Tyler, the association's director general, said on Wednesday.
The trade group, which represents most of the world's airlines, said its 2015 forecast was based on an average price of $85 a barrel. That would be the lowest fuel price for the industry since 2010.
While consumers expect price drops to be reflected quickly in the price of gas at the pump, there is typically a lag with ticket prices. One reason is that airlines buy their fuel in advance, to hedge against higher costs. But if prices fall, this can effectively lock them into higher fixed prices for several months.
"If you've already bought and paid for your turkey for next Thanksgiving, and prices come down in the meantime, you won't get any benefit from any subsequent reduction in turkey prices," said John Strickland, an independent airline consultant in London. In addition, he said that airlines "also swallowed the pain of rapidly rising prices in the last year or so," which have not been fully reflected in fares.
Another reason is that airlines have little incentive to reduce their fares now. Many flights are full, and carriers are reinvesting much of their profit in the business, paying dividends to shareholders or giving bonuses to employees.
Airlines insist that air travel remains a bargain, even at today's prices, once adjusted for inflation. For instance, while consumer prices have increased 35 percent since 2000, airfares have risen 22 percent, including extra bag fees and other ancillary revenue, according to Airlines for America, a trade group. Operating expenses for the nine publicly traded American passenger carriers in the first nine months of the year rose 3.1 percent as declines in fuel costs were offset by higher costs elsewhere, the group said.
United States airlines paid $115 million less in fuel costs for the first nine months of 2014 compared with last year, a 0.3 percent reduction, the group said.
John Heimlich, the trade group's chief economist, said airlines were reinvesting at the highest rate in 13 years. This includes improvements onboard the planes, enhanced airport facilities and amenities, and rewards to employees.
"It is critical to make the investments now and capitalize on the current environment," he said.
Many of the improvements have been directed at the airlines' most lucrative passengers, who are flying in business class or paying for full-fare coach seats. The majority of travelers who are seeking regular or cheaper tickets in coach are not seeing many of these benefits.
Delta Air Lines, for instance, announced on Monday a new lineup of its cabin classes. It renamed its business section Delta One, instead of BusinessFirst, and said it would have new quilted seat covers there. In the back of the plane, it introduced a class of fares called Basic Economy, the cheapest fares.
Passengers with those tickets, though, will not be able to book their seats in advance and will not be able to refund or change those tickets.
American Airlines announced this week that it would spend $2 billion to improve customer experience at the airport and inside its planes. Part of that investment includes adding more lie-flat seats for business class passengers and rolling out Wi-Fi satellite connections for its international flights.
"I don't think they are going to pass the savings on to consumers as lower fares, but they might pass it on as better service or profit-sharing to their employees," said George Hobica, the founder of Airfarewatchdog.com, a website that provides information on fares and air travel deals. "Planes are full even at these higher fares. So I think the airlines are going to pass these savings as intangibles."
Air France-KLM is spending more than $1.2 billion to refurbish planes, add services and modernize its airport lounges and ground services. Air France is getting new business-class seats on its planes.
"The rules of the game have changed," Mr. de Juniac, the Air France-KLM chairman, said during a brief visit to New York, where Air France recently reopened its business-class lounge at Kennedy International Airport. The facility now includes a spa where passengers can receive a facial treatment, shower or a meal before boarding their trans-Atlantic flights to Paris.
"We have to do this because our competitors are very good and we have to be better," he said.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The number of available jobs in the United States rose in October to the second-highest level in 14 years, and companies kept hiring at a healthy pace, adding to evidence of an improving economy.
Job openings increased 3.2 percent, to 4.83 million, the Labor Department said Tuesday. That is just below August's total, which was the highest on record dating back to 2000. Total hiring slipped 0.4 percent, to 5.1 million after reaching a seven-year high in September.
The number of people quitting was mostly unchanged at a six-year high of 2.7 million.
The overall figures paint a picture of a more dynamic job market, with businesses filling more open jobs and more Americans quitting, typically for better-paying opportunities. More quits and more job postings provide more opportunities for the unemployed to find work.
Job openings have been rising strongly all year, but total hiring has only picked up in the last couple of months. That suggests employers are stepping up their efforts to fill open positions. The number of available jobs has increased 21 percent in the last 12 months, while hiring is up 12 percent. That gap has narrowed significantly this year.
More people quitting and growth in hiring can also help drive up wages, which have barely kept up with inflation since the recession ended.
The data comes after last Friday's surprisingly strong jobs report. Employers added a net total of 321,000 jobs in November, the most in nearly three years. Job gains have averaged 241,000 jobs a month this year, the healthiest pace in 15 years.
Still, the job market is not yet back to full health. There are still nearly 7 million people working part-time jobs who would prefer full-time work, up from 4.1 million before the Great Recession.
Tuesday's data is from the Job Openings and Labor Turnover survey, or JOLTS, which provides a more detailed look at the job market than the monthly employment report. It includes figures for overall hiring, as well as the number of quits and layoffs. The monthly jobs figures are a net total of job gains or losses.
The Federal Reserve's chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, has cited the levels of quits and hires as a major indicator of job market health. She and other Fed officials are monitoring those trends as they consider when to raise short-term interest rates from near-zero levels. Most economists forecast that will not happen until the middle of next year.
Separately, inventories held by wholesale businesses rose in October, while sales posted a smaller gain.
Wholesale inventories increased 0.4 percent, matching September's figure, the Commerce Department reported Tuesday. Sales edged up just 0.2 percent during the month after a flat reading in September and a 0.8 percent drop in August.
Economists are watching closely to see if businesses become reluctant to expand inventories in the face of weaker sales. That could drag on economic growth because the restocking of store shelves spurs orders to manufacturers, which in turn increases factory production.
But any cutback in inventory building could be a sign that businesses are worried about future sales.
The October gain pushed wholesale inventories to a seasonally adjusted $542 billion, an increase of 6.8 percent from the level a year earlier.

Abstract: (Mr. Elmendorf, as it happens, was an obscure staff member on the C.B.O. team evaluating the Clinton bill.) ABC News called the July 2009 hearing "a blow to President Obama and Democrats pressing health care reform." The Affordable Care Act would reduce the deficit in the long run, the budget office forecast, because its new taxes and its cost-cutting would exceed the new spending on health coverage for the uninsured.

Full text:   Many Senate hearings are mere theater, but one that took place on July 16, 2009, mattered. With Congress in the midst of writing the bill that became Obamacare, senators asked Douglas Elmendorf, the director of the Congressional Budget Office, to evaluate their efforts.
In the hearing's pivotal moment, Senator Kent Conrad -- the North Dakota Democrat who was then the Budget Committee chairman -- asked Mr. Elmendorf whether the legislation was likely to curb the growth in health costs, as its advocates asserted.
"From what you have seen," Mr. Conrad asked, "do you see a successful effort being mounted to bend the long-term cost curve?"
Mr. Elmendorf's answer was clear. "No, Mr. Chairman," he said. "We do not see the sort of fundamental changes that would be necessary to reduce the trajectory of federal health spending by a significant amount. And on the contrary, the legislation significantly expands the federal responsibility for health care costs."
For anyone who remembered health care history, the moment was ominous. It recalled the role that the budget office -- Congress's official scorekeeper -- played in scuttling President Bill Clinton's efforts to pass a health care bill. (Mr. Elmendorf, as it happens, was an obscure staff member on the C.B.O. team evaluating the Clinton bill.)
ABC News called the July 2009 hearing "a blow to President Obama and Democrats pressing health care reform." The Washington Examiner, a conservative publication, later wrote that Mr. Elmendorf had "helped fuel the cross-country uprising against the health plan." Liberals, meanwhile, tried to fight back by citing other experts who seemed more upbeat than Mr. Elmendorf.
But congressional Democrats knew that the budget office had the loudest voice, and their staff members got to work (which may have been Mr. Conrad's purpose in asking the question). They added provisions to nudge the health care system away from paying for the quantity of medical care rather than the quality.
Ultimately, the C.B.O. judged those provisions to be substantive. The Affordable Care Act would reduce the deficit in the long run, the budget office forecast, because its new taxes and its cost-cutting would exceed the new spending on health coverage for the uninsured.
That judgment is back in the news again because Republican leaders in Congress are trying to decide whether to reappoint Mr. Elmendorf as the budget office director. Several conservative intellectuals -- like Gregory Mankiw of Harvard and Charles Murray and Alan Viard of the American Enterprise Institute -- support another Elmendorf term. Some conservative activists oppose him, in large part, as my colleague Jonathan Weisman wrote, because of his "positive assessments of the cost and impact of the health care law."
This column isn't going to take a position on Mr. Elmendorf. I understand why Republicans might want to appoint one of their own, rather than someone who previously worked at the Brookings Institution and the Clinton Treasury Department. I also see why Republicans might see value in re-appointing someone with Mr. Elmendorf's résumé (which includes a high-level stint at the Federal Reserve) and credibility.
What's struck me about the debate is how it highlights our resistance to good economic news. A central plank of the anti-Elmendorf case is the notion that his budget office has underestimated health care costs. Senator Pat Roberts, the Kansas Republican, went so far this year as to call for a hearing on the subject.
In reality, the Congressional Budget Office -- like nearly every other group of health care analysts -- has overestimated medical costs. We're in the midst of a historic slowdown in the growth of medical costs, in which a series of loosely affiliated efforts to cut waste seem to be paying off. Total national spending on health care last year grew at the slowest rate since records began in 1960, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services reported last week.
The Affordable Care Act -- specifically, those provisions meant to reward quality, like one that tries to cut down on needless hospitalization -- plays some role in the slowdown but is not the main cause. It was instead part of a broader effort among doctors, nurses, hospital executives, policy makers and others to reduce waste. Whatever the cause, though, the result is clear: The Congressional Budget Office has modestly reduced its estimate of the law's cost since it passed.
Beyond the health law, the budget office has repeatedly cut its estimates of overall health care spending. It now expects Medicare to spend about $11,000 per beneficiary in 2016. As recently as 2006, the forecast for 2016 was about $15,000. Multiplied by millions of Medicare recipients, that's real money.
How, then, are the budget office's critics claiming otherwise? Mostly through accounting tricks. For starters, they tend to look only at portions of the health law that spend money and ignore those parts that cut spending or raise taxes. It's akin to saying a family is going bankrupt because it bought a new car -- while overlooking that it also canceled a vacation and that Mom received a raise.
Within the parts of the law that spend money -- the car in my analogy -- critics have ignored programs that are costing somewhat less than expected and emphasized those that are costing somewhat more. Or, perhaps most common, they have made much out of the fact that the law's costs rise as it covers more people, claiming that the budget office didn't expect that increase (which is false).
I realize that some of these claims aren't meant to be serious economic arguments. They're political ones, intended to influence a political choice. But Mr. Elmendorf's critics are hardly the only ones taking a gloomy view of the health care system, even as the evidence keeps offering new reasons for optimism.
Last week's report on medical costs, for example, showed that health spending made up 17.4 percent of economic output last year, a level that has not changed in four years. It's stunning. In the previous four years, the share jumped 1.9 percentage points, from 15.5 percent. Back then, analysts viewed an ever-expanding health sector -- one that drove up the deficit, crowded out spending on schools and highways and cut further into Americans' paychecks -- as inevitable.
To be clear, no one should declare victory yet. There is a serious debate about what will happen with health spending in coming years, as the population continues to age and the ranks of the uninsured presumably shrink. But it's silly to wave away the health-cost slowdown as meaningless -- or to pretend that health costs are actually surging.
Twenty-five years ago, Gregg Easterbrook wrote a cover article for The New Republic titled "The Sky Is Always Falling," in which he lampooned the rest of the news media for being able to find the dark lining in any economic trend. Wage growth is weak? Start the recession watch. Wages are surging? Time to fear inflation.
There are real consequences to such perma-pessimism. If you think every development is cause for gloom, you can't distinguish between the economy's real problems -- of which there is no shortage -- with the potential solutions to those problems.

Full text:   YOU would have thought by now -- 43 years after President Richard M. Nixon scrapped the gold standard -- that gold's role as an economic instrument was over. After all, the mighty metal that once held sway over the global monetary system was supposed to have, by this point, finally been reduced to just another asset peddled on the Internet.
But in fact in recent weeks, gold has experienced a renaissance of sorts, quietly re-emerging as the centerpiece of a handful of initiatives in Europe, Asia and the Middle East. On Dec. 1, voters in Switzerland considered -- and eventually rejected -- a populist plan to force its central bank to buy gold in a controversial bid to stabilize its currency. Russia and China both made headlines by snapping up enormous stores of gold. In late November, Marine Le Pen of France, a nationalist politician, called on her government to start amassing gold, and the Netherlands followed suit, revealing that same week that it had repatriated $5 billion of its own gold from a vault in New York City owned by the Federal Reserve.
Even the Islamic State, it appears, has become intrigued by gold. Declaring last month that it wanted to avoid "the tyrant's financial system," the group released a statement announcing that it was planning to produce a line of custom-made gold coins.
What's going on here? Like almost everything concerning gold, the experts don't agree. Some have interpreted the metal's mini-comeback as an indication that financial Armageddon, in the guise of runaway inflation, is approaching. Others have read the recent moves as a symbolic way for central banks and governments to make a show of strength in nervously uncertain economic times.
"Holding gold, for people and for governments, reflects our anxieties about the future," said Michael Bordo, a professor of economics at Rutgers University who specializes in monetary history and policy. "Even though it might seem somewhat retrograde, to many investors, having it on hand is something safe."
At a time when central banks around the globe have tried to foster growth by aggressively printing money -- which can in theory devalue sovereign currencies -- moves by countries to recall their stores of gold can help create a "culture of stability," Professor Bordo said. But then again, to simply stockpile gold doesn't guarantee the health of an economy, and some analysts have said that such notions of stability are often more psychological than actual.
The Swiss proposal, for example, called for the central bank to hold at least 20 percent of its national reserves in gold. While the referendum was designed in part to reassure Swiss citizens concerned about the solvency of their money, some historians have argued that, even had it passed, it would have had no palpable effect on the value of the franc.
"It was mostly a symbolic move," said Richard Sylla, a professor of the history of financial markets and institutions at New York University. "Which isn't to say that it was crazy or unfounded. What the Swiss were really saying by considering the plan was that some of them were going to feel a whole lot better if they had tons of gold inside the bank."'
There remains the question of why gold has traditionally served as the economy's equivalent of comfort food. According to Professor Bordo, it is, for one thing, a highly liquid asset that is easily exchanged for other currencies.
Furthermore, he added, when it was used as part of the gold standard, its controlled supply served to limit central banks from printing money and put a lid on profligate government spending.
Needless to say, in an era when the balance sheets of many central banks have expanded to unprecedented scope, there has been plenty of discussion of those last two trends, causing a pessimistic sect of economic experts to augur pending doom in the repatriation schemes and the shopping sprees by Moscow and Beijing.
"By purchasing gold, China and Russia have indicated that they understand how fragile things are and that they're getting ready for the demise of the dollar," said James G. Rickards, author of "The Death of Money: The Coming Collapse of the International Monetary System." "At the same time, other countries have been watching what they're doing and are saying to themselves, 'If things are really that bad, then we better get our gold back,' possession being nine-tenths of the law."
Of course, not all economists have interpreted gold's resurgence as heralding a geopolitical disaster.
To Joshua Aizenman, a professor of economics and international relations at the University of Southern California, dabbling in gold is mainly an attempt by bankers and officials to send a message to the world -- one that signals an appetite for power or that broadcasts a desire to challenge a rival. "I doubt that the Chinese or the Russians actually believe that gold is such a great investment in terms of pure returns," Professor Aizenman said. "But if they're trying to suggest that they're unhappy with the dollar or that they want to become a global player, then gold is very powerful.
"The investment is a symbol," he explained. "It's made for political, not financial, gain."

Abstract: The steadily improving labor market makes it more likely the Federal Reserve will start raising short-term interest rates sooner rather than later, which could lead to some turmoil in financial markets in the months ahead.

Full text:   Ever since the recovery from the Great Recession began more than five years ago, the most crucial missing pieces of the economic puzzle were the lack of consistently strong gains in hiring and better wages for most working Americans struggling to make ends meet. Now, at last, those pieces are starting to fall into place.
The Labor Department reported on Friday that employers added 321,000 jobs in November, a much stronger number than economists had predicted and the 10th consecutive month of net job gains above 200,000.
Even more significant was that the improving job market finally delivered a sharp jump in average hourly earnings for ordinary workers that was double the anticipated 0.2 percent increase.
The jobless rate itself stayed at 5.8 percent.
The pickup in wage growth comes as gasoline prices are plunging, providing a double boon for consumers and retailers with the holiday shopping season underway.
With one month still to go, the total increase in payrolls of 2.65 million is already the best annual figure since the late 1990s.
"In one line: spectacular and, more to the point, believable," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
"We've had strong hiring indicators in a number of surveys, and lower jobless claims, so sooner or later, we were going to get a blockbuster number."
In economics most things cut both ways, however, and Friday's report was no exception. The steadily improving labor market makes it more likely the Federal Reserve will start raising short-term interest rates sooner rather than later, which could lead to some turmoil in financial markets in the months ahead.
Most economists expect the central bank to increase interest rates in mid-2015, after leaving them near zero since the depths of the financial crisis in late 2008.
Some experts now argue that the Fed may move to raise its key interest rate lever as early as March next year, but most are still sticking with midyear.
In addition, some of the worrisome signs that have haunted the monthly jobs report for years have not gone away.
The proportion of people in the labor force was unchanged last month and is stuck near multidecade lows, an indication that few of the workers who gave up the search for work during the lean years are likely to be hired anytime soon.
In addition, about 6.9 million Americans are working part time because they cannot find full-time positions. The broadest measure of unemployment, which includes these workers, dropped to 11.3 percent, down 0.1 percent from October.
Mr. Shepherdson cautioned that he wanted to see the stronger hourly wage gain in November -- up 0.4 percent after an anemic 0.1 increase in October and no gain in September -- continue for several months before he would be convinced higher wages were here to stay.
"I've had my fingers burned before," he said.
The November data alone isn't enough to shift the Fed's thinking, said Guy Berger, United States economist at RBS. "In all likelihood, we will see faster wage growth over the next six months, but as far as the Fed is concerned, one month alone could be noise," he said.
"Our view now is that the first rate hike will come in June."
In particular, Mr. Berger noted that there was a risk the jump in hourly earnings represented a catch-up from the weak readings the previous two months.
"The coming months will tell us whether November was a fluke or the beginning of a sustained pickup from the 2 percent annual wage gains we've had over the past four years," he said.
Although the prospect of higher interest rates tends to make investors more cautious, both stocks and bonds rose modestly on Friday, with traders figuring a better job market and better-paid consumers outweighed whatever cooling effect higher borrowing rates could have.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 3.45 points, to 2,075.37, and the Dow Jones industrial average gained 58.69 points, to 17,958.79.
Although government number crunchers try to adjust for seasonal swings like hiring by stores ahead of the holiday, retailing still showed unusual strength, adding 50,000 workers in November. That was more than twice the average monthly gain of 22,000 retail workers over the last year.
Manufacturers, often seen as a bellwether of swings in the broader economy and a source of good blue-collar jobs, particularly for men, hired 28,000 workers in November.
One sector that will be watched for signs of weakness in the months ahead is the energy patch. It has been one of the best-performing industries in terms of job growth in recent years, but that could quickly reverse if low oil prices persist. Last month, the number of workers involved directly in drilling and extraction inched up by 200, to 215,200, but support positions in the oil and gas industry shrank by 2,400, to 327,000.
This category is still up by more than 20,000 in 2014, but November was the first time this year that the number of energy industry support workers actually fell.
Government statisticians also revised upward the number of jobs added in September and October by 44,000, another good sign.
Despite the deep economic frustration many Americans express, evident in everything from public opinion surveys to water cooler chats to last month's congressional elections, the American economy has made significant progress this year. In November 2013, for instance, the unemployment rate was 7 percent, and the jobless rate five years ago this month was 9.9 percent.
Last month, average gasoline prices in the United States fell below $3 a gallon for the first time since 2010, as crude oil prices plunged. Crude oil has continued to drop since then, to about $66 a barrel, which suggests prices at the pump have further to drop.
If the Federal Reserve raises interest rates next year, the real estate sector could be dealt a setback, especially in more affluent areas where home prices have surged.
So why the persistent gloom, not to mention anger?
Until now, wage gains for most Americans who kept their jobs throughout the downturn and recovery have been very modest. The 2.1 percent wage increase over the last 12 months is barely enough to keep up with inflation.
For wages to show meaningful gains over a sustained period of time, as was the case in the 1990s, the unemployment rate will have to drop further, perhaps below 5 percent, said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial.
Just how low unemployment can go without stoking inflation is set to become the next big economic argument in Washington as well as on Wall Street. On Capitol Hill, some Republicans say the Fed should move more aggressively to tighten its monetary stance.
"As the job market improves, the Federal Reserve must begin to normalize monetary policy," said Representative Kevin P. Brady, a Texas Republican who is chairman of the Joint Economic Committee.
But Ms. Swonk, like many other economists, says it is critical that the central bank not move too quickly now that the recovery finally seems to be settling into higher gear.
"We are still regaining ground lost by many households, and we don't want to squander that," Ms. Swonk said. "We're not back to the 1990s, nowhere near it. But the good news is that we're making progress."

Abstract: [...]even if the growth numbers hold up, problems persist in job quality, as measured by pay and working conditions.

Full text:   The employment report for November, released on Friday, was the best report in years. The economy added 321,000 jobs, the largest monthly gain since January 2012.
The unemployment rate held steady at 5.8 percent, still much higher than on the eve of the recession seven years ago but a more-or-less steady, if painfully slow, improvement from the recession-era high of 10 percent in October 2009 and 7 percent as recently as one year ago.
Yet, it is still too soon to say with any confidence that the labor market has found its footing. Some of November's unexpected strength in job creation could turn out to be the result of seasonal factors. And even if the growth numbers hold up, problems persist in job quality, as measured by pay and working conditions.
For example, the 9-cent increase in average hourly wages in November, to $24.66, while welcome, is not enough to make up for prolonged wage stagnation. Measured year to year, hourly wage growth hasn't accelerated since 2010; it remains stuck at around 2 percent, which is barely ahead of inflation. When hourly wages are flat, the only way to earn more is to work more.
In November, the average workweek for all employees rose modestly, to 34.6 hours. A longer workweek is a good sign in an economy beset with part-time jobs. But it also means that gains in average weekly pay in the past year stem from more hours at stagnant wages.
Worse, the averages mask deep wells of weakness. Supervisors and managers got most of the pay raises and extra hours in November.
For production and nonsupervisory workers who make up the vast majority of the work force, average hourly pay rose by only 4 cents, to $20.74, and the average workweek was unchanged, at 33.8 hours.
Even that overstates the day-to-day reality and prospects of many workers. Fully a quarter of the jobs created in November were in retail and in leisure and hospitality, fields that in general do not offer enough pay or hours to make a living.
For example, average hourly pay for nonsupervisors in retail jobs was $14.49; for those in leisure and hospitality, it was $14.10. Other large fields, including fast food and home care, pay far less than that.
Workers who are demonstrating for $15 an hour, in ever greater numbers and across an increasing number of fields, have a legitimate grievance. The economy has been expanding, and profits have been rising, but not pay.
The November report is the best one in a long time. But it is not nearly good enough.

Abstract: In a speech at Northwestern University before the midterm elections as well as at a White House news conference just after the vote and in remarks to corporate executives this week, Mr. Obama has laid out a more forceful case for a broad-gauge recovery, drawing parallels to the record-setting job creation of Bill Clinton's presidency.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Before introducing his nominee to fill the job of defense secretary, President Obama took a moment on Friday to celebrate the creation of 321,000 additional jobs in November. It was as close to a victory lap on the economy that Mr. Obama has taken.
"It's worth us every once in a while reflecting on the fact that the American economy is making real progress," the president said, after ticking off a series of monthly and annual statistics for job growth that the American economy has not experienced since the 1990s.
Among the criticisms leveled at the White House, by former administration officials and Democrats on Capitol Hill, is that Mr. Obama has not taken enough credit for the good things that have occurred on his watch. Nowhere has that reluctance been more evident than in his cautious reaction to a string of strong jobs reports.
Despite the fact that the economy has added jobs for 57 straight months -- the longest streak on record, Mr. Obama said on Friday -- he has until now steadfastly avoided a triumphant tone. That is because the job growth has not been matched by wage growth, which has meant that many Americans are not feeling the benefits of the recovery.
That may have changed with the November employment report. In addition to a better-than-expected growth in the number of jobs, those workers' average hourly wages rose 0.4 percent, twice what economists expected. While only a monthly number, it could suggest that wages are finally rebounding, too, which would put more cash in the pockets of working people.
Mr. Obama coupled his sanguine tone with a warning to Congress not to derail the progress by shutting down the government. And, as always, he conceded a lot of work remained. But he noted that the United States was now outperforming much of the world economically -- a theme he emphasized at the Group of 20 summit meeting last month in Australia.
"We've put more people back to work than Europe, Japan, and all other industrialized advanced countries combined," the president said, "and we're going to keep at it until every single American who is willing and able to work can find not just any job but a job that pays a decent wage and allows them to support their families."
The recovery has gained enough traction, White House officials say, that Mr. Obama can afford to shake off some of his ambivalence and make a robust case for how the accelerating job growth is likely to translate into higher wages.
In a speech at Northwestern University before the midterm elections as well as at a White House news conference just after the vote and in remarks to corporate executives this week, Mr. Obama has laid out a more forceful case for a broad-gauge recovery, drawing parallels to the record-setting job creation of Bill Clinton's presidency.
Few leaders knew how to seize credit for good news like Mr. Clinton, fellow Democrats say nostalgically. In a speech at the White House in 1998, he hailed his first balanced budget as a "landmark achievement," reaping enormous credit for fiscal responsibility.
Having taken office during a prolonged recession, Mr. Obama has only recently been able to point to a half-decent economy. But critics say the White House has not made enough of another more promising development: the nation's evolving energy independence -- a product of the boom in domestic production of oil and natural gas.
Now, though, the trends in energy are converging with macroeconomic trends in a way that may address Mr. Obama's concern that middle-income people have missed out on the recovery's benefits. The steep fall in gasoline prices, economists say, is tamping down inflation, which will make people's paychecks go further.
"There's no question that the disconnect between the macroeconomy and middle-class lives is significant, and that gap hasn't narrowed nearly as much as it should have," said Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities who was formerly chief economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.
"But the acceleration in employment growth is real, significant and important," he said, "and I have to believe people are feeling it, if not in their paychecks than in their job security."
For Mr. Obama, administration officials said, striking the right tone on the economy has been a constant balancing act. In remarks to corporate executives at the Business Roundtable on Wednesday, the president noted that corporate profits were fat. But in speeches to broader audiences, Mr. Obama notes that ordinary Americans continue to struggle.
"Does the president being optimistic lead to further confidence in the economy and a sense of opportunity? Or does the president being optimistic sound discordant and cause people to lose faith that they're going to get out of this?" Jennifer Palmieri, the White House communications director, asked. "That's the balance we have to strike."
On Friday, as his nominee for defense secretary, Ashton B. Carter, stood by him, Mr. Obama sounded as if he believed the balance had fallen clearly on the side of optimism.
"If we can continue on this trajectory, if we can continue to grow robustly," he said, "we can get a virtuous cycle that's really going to make a difference and be a critical component of strengthening our national security, because national security starts with a strong economy here at home."

Full text:   GOVERNMENT construction spending -- on such things as roads, schools and sewage plants -- is finally on the rise again.
The Census Bureau reported this week that the federal, state and local governments spent $271.1 billion on construction projects during the 12 months through October, 0.3 percent more than in the previous 12 months.
Among the largest categories of public spending on building, spending was up for roads and other transportation projects, as well as on sewers and waste disposal plants. But spending on school construction was lower than in the previous year, as was spending on water projects and public safety.
As can be seen from the accompanying charts -- which begin at the end of 2007, as the Great Recession began -- public construction spending appeared to be holding up at first, although that was in part because of the lags between decisions on spending and the actual spending. In addition, projects that are started are likely to be finished, even if in retrospect beginning the project no longer seems to have been a wise decision.
Construction spending by state and local governments peaked in 2009 and soon began to decline as budget constraints took hold, but federal spending soared as the Obama administration tried to stimulate the stumbling economy. Federal construction spending climbed to $31.1 billion in 2010, more than 50 percent higher than the 2007 figure, and stayed close to that level in 2011. But it began to decline in 2012, as pressures built to hold down spending.
The recent growth in government construction spending has come from a revival in state and local government projects. Federal construction spending shows scant signs of recovery, although it remains above prerecession levels.
On a year-over-year basis, total 12-month public construction spending fell continually from early 2010 through August of this year. October was the second month to show a year-over-year increase. The figures are not adjusted for inflation.
Among the categories of public construction spending shown in the accompanying charts, it was spending on public safety construction that rose the fastest early in the recession. Much of that increase went to spending for local police and sheriffs, including jails. Almost none of it went to spending for fire stations.
There was also a large increase in transportation spending -- an area that includes airports, marinas and railroads. The much larger area of streets and highways grew at a much lower rate, as did spending on schools.
But spending on public safety construction has since retreated, and in the most recent 12 months was lower than it was before the recession. The same is true of spending on water and sewage plants. Spending on education -- largely school construction -- remains more than 20 percent below 2007 levels. Spending on transportation projects, and on streets and highways, remains at or near record levels, at least before inflation is taken into account.
Chart After Four Years, Public Construction Spending Turns Higher: Even As the Rate of Growth Slowed, Public Construction Spending Climbed Early in the Financial Crisis, As Part of Efforts to Stimulate the Economy, but Turned Lower As Government Spending Was Squeezed. Now, Public Construction Spending Is On the Rise Again. The Figures Are Not Adjusted for Inflation. (Source: Census Bureau, Via Haver Analytics)

Full text:   FRANKFURT -- Mario Draghi wanted everyone to understand on Thursday that the European Central Bank was determined to honor its prime directive: keeping inflation, now dangerously low, in check.
"We have a mandate. We don't tolerate prolonged deviations from our mandate," Mr. Draghi, the bank's president, said at a news conference. "Not to pursue our mandate would be illegal."
But it has been almost two years since the eurozone's central bank last achieved its inflation target of about 2 percent. Inflation has fallen steadily since then, and it is now close to zero.
Mr. Draghi and the central bank did not take concrete action on Thursday. Instead, he offered assurances that more aggressive stimulus was just around the corner, perhaps the type of large-scale bond purchases used by the United States Federal Reserve.
The question is how long the European Central Bank and Mr. Draghi can merely hint at actions yet to come. There were already signs of doubt on Thursday, as European stocks were down broadly even before Mr. Draghi's news conference ended.
"At some point, they will lose credibility," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. "They still have time, but time is running out."
Mr. Draghi said that the European Central Bank would reassess its stimulus measures early next year and that its governing council "remains unanimous in its commitment to using additional unconventional instruments within its mandate."
That statement was nearly identical to ones he made in October and November.
And Mr. Draghi refused to specify what kind of assets the central bank was likely to buy, saying only that many options had been discussed. He did not commit to taking action in January, when the governing council will next meet on monetary policy.
"It doesn't mean at the next meeting," he said of the possibility of an asset-purchase program. The decision would depend on how inflation developed and other factors, including the effect of the steep decline in oil prices, he said.
Low inflation can make it difficult for companies to raise prices to cover their costs. That in turn can lead businesses to cut wages and discourage them from hiring. Deflation can create a self-perpetuating stagnation of the sort that has troubled Japan in recent decades.
The European Central Bank has not been idle during the last two years. It has cut its benchmark interest rate seven times under Mr. Draghi to its current low of 0.05 percent, or effectively zero. The central bank left the rate unchanged on Thursday.
It has taken the virtually unprecedented stop of introducing a negative interest rate on money that commercial banks store at the central bank, to induce them to lend the funds. And it has allowed banks to borrow money on extremely favorable terms for up to four years. The central bank is set to issue another round of cheap four-year loans next week.
The central bank has also begun a mild form of so-called quantitative easing focused on purchases of bank loans that have been bundled into securities. So far, the purchases have been a tiny fraction of the bank's planned expansion of its balance sheet, a measure of the volume of its monetary stimulus.
The central bank intends to expand the balance sheet by 1 trillion euros, or $1.23 trillion. From Oct. 20, when the purchases began, through Nov. 28, the central bank spent [EUR]18.2 billion buying private sector assets.
One rationale for the European Central Bank's hesitation to embark on a big bond-buying program is that it wants to give the earlier measures a chance to work before taking more controversial steps. A decision to buy government bonds, an essential component of a quantitative easing program, would be deeply unpopular in Germany and could provoke a split among the 24 members of the governing council. Such purchases would also prompt legal challenges.
Mr. Draghi said the central bank was prepared to act even if the decision was not unanimous, suggesting that quantitative easing could begin over the objections of Germany. But he also seemed to hold out hope that the Germans on the governing council and other skeptics could be brought on board.
"We don't need unanimity," he said. But he added: "I believe it can be designed to have consensus. I'm still confident."
He indicated that the planning was already underway, saying, "Technical preparations have been stepped up for further measures, which could be implemented in a timely manner, if needed."
Mr. Draghi also had an answer to economists who have questioned whether large-scale asset purchases would be an effective way to lift the inflation rate. The doubters cite the eurozone's fragmented financial markets and lack of a widely traded, low-risk asset similar to the United States Treasury securities that the Fed has bought in its quantitative easing program.
"There is enough evidence to say it could be effective," Mr. Draghi said.
But that statement raised questions about why, in that case, the European Central Bank has not already acted -- especially considering that its own economists issued more pessimistic forecasts on Thursday.
Inflation in the eurozone next year will be 0.7 percent on average, the staff economists said, compared with a forecast of 1.1 percent as recently as September. And growth in 2015 will be only 1 percent, the central bank economists said, compared with an earlier forecast of 1.6 percent.
"Mr. Draghi's ability to buoy financial markets through his words (and his words alone) is diminishing with each passing day," Nicholas Spiro, managing director of Spiro Sovereign Strategy, said by email. "The E.C.B.'s inability to take meaningful action to avert the threat of deflation could become the trigger for a much more pronounced deterioration in market sentiment towards the eurozone."
The annual rate of inflation in the eurozone last month was 0.3 percent. Inflation is expected to fall further this month, perhaps to zero, because of declines in oil prices.
The eurozone has narrowly avoided slipping back into recession. But growth remains too weak to make a significant dent in the unemployment rate, which was 11.5 percent in October.
Mr. Draghi and other members of the governing council may be hoping that the drop in oil prices will help economic growth so that purchases of government bonds may not be necessary. But the longer the bank waits, the greater the risk that low inflation or deflation could become entrenched.
"The eurozone economy is flat on its back and flirting with recession," said Mr. Zandi, the Moody's Analytics economist. "They still can avoid full-blown, outright eurozone deflation. But it's close."

Full text:   When is good economic news a reason to worry?
When you're a central banker fighting a slump toward deflation, or broadly falling prices, in a time that oil prices are plummeting. And that is the situation that Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, faced as he announced the results of the bank's latest policy meeting on Thursday. How he wrestles with that problem will help determine the outlook for Europe's flailing economy.
The official line from many of the world's most influential makers of economic policy is that this is fantastic news for global growth, at least in places that don't count oil production as their dominant local industry.
"If I was to address an audience in Saudi Arabia, Qatar or Kuwait, I wouldn't discuss it exactly the same way," said Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, at an event in Washington this week. "But on a net-net basis, it is good news for the global economy."
The fund estimates that a 30 percent decline in oil prices should improve growth by 0.8 of a percentage point in most advanced economies, Ms. Lagarde said. And prices are down more than that -- about 35 percent since June 30.
There is little doubt that falling prices for oil and other commodities are good news for global consumers, as we noted last week. Less money spent on gasoline and other fuels means more to spend on everything else, in effect raising people's real incomes.
But the challenge Mr. Draghi and his fellow central bankers face is that they are trying -- almost desperately -- to attain higher inflation, closer to the 2 percent they target. And falling oil prices will drive inflation down further, particularly as the lower price of oil ripples through global supply chains and starts to affect more retail prices.
In Central Banking 101, they teach you this about fluctuations in energy prices: It would be unwise to react to short-term moves that will have only a transitory effect on inflation. Oil prices go up and down -- there's nothing you can do about it -- but when they do, it doesn't tell you much about the longer-term path of inflation. Central bankers should keep looking over the horizon and focusing on the medium term.
Following that guidance, central bankers would do pretty much whatever they were planning to do a few months ago, before the oil sell-off began. For the Fed, that would mean raising interest rates in mid-2015.
But the Central Banking 101 lesson changes when a move in the price of oil and other commodities has some lasting effects on people's psychology. In the 1970s, for example, the oil price spikes caused by the Arab embargo combined with steadily increasing prices and wages to make people expect ever-increasing inflation, which became self-fulfilling as the decade progressed.
In the 1970s, in other words, even if the Fed and other central banks shouldn't have reacted to the initial spike in oil prices, they should (in hindsight) have done more to fight the rising expectation of high inflation that it helped foster.
We are in the exact opposite situation right now. Inflation is persistently low across the advanced world amid sluggish growth. And expectations are setting in more and more that this low-inflation world is here to stay, at least as measured by the bond market.
At the same time oil prices have fallen, investors' expectations for future inflation have also been falling in most of the world's leading economies; in Germany, bond market prices suggest annual inflation will be only 0.26 percent over the next five years, down from 0.8 percent at the end of June.
Markets are even pricing in lower American inflation in the five years after that -- 2019 through 2024 -- than they were this past summer.
So what's a central banker to do? A different tone is emanating from the three most important global central banks.
In the United States, the Fed vice chairman, Stanley Fischer, said this week that he viewed falling oil prices as "a phenomenon that's making everybody better off" and that "the lower inflation that we'll get from a lower price of oil is going to be temporary."
His counterparts in Japan and Europe don't seem so sure. The Bank of Japan recently did a surprise expansion of its program to pump yen into the Japanese economy, in part because lower energy prices are causing falling inflation at a time the bank is trying to persuade consumers and businesses that inflation will rise.
In his news conference Thursday, Mr. Draghi betrayed deep-seated worries that the falling oil prices would affect this inflationary psychology. While he concluded, like Ms. Lagarde and Mr. Fischer, that the impact of energy price declines was "unambiguously positive," he continued by mentioning that the bank was monitoring an "effect that might happen if the lower prices get embedded in a lower wage formation process."
In other words, workers might demand smaller raises and employers might be less likely to grant raises amid the falling oil prices, which would create a self-fulfilling cycle leading to still lower inflation. Mr. Draghi said that the bank's governing council would evaluate this possibility as it weighs new actions to try to increase growth and inflation in Europe early next year.
Indeed, Bill Dudley, president of the New York Fed, said in a speech this week that this might be another way lower oil prices make the United States better off: It may be the thing that pushes policy makers in Europe and Japan to act more forcefully to combat their nations' economic weakness, which may just make everybody better off.

Full text:   MOSCOW -- The defining event of Vladimir V. Putin's initial rise to power was the crushing of an Islamist insurgency in Chechnya, at the cost of human rights abuses and years of dictatorial rule there.
The defining event since his return to the presidency two years ago was his hard-line response to the Ukraine uprising in February, with the invasion and annexation of Crimea and the incursion into southeastern Ukraine -- while sneering at critics in the West.
On Thursday, Mr. Putin was forced to contend with trouble on both fronts, as insurgents mounted a deadly attack in the Chechen capital of Grozny, and he was compelled in his yearly address to reassure Russians that his assertive foreign policy would not bring economic ruin.
An overnight attack in Grozny left at least 20 people dead and shattered years of relative calm. Yet just as the attack reminded Russians that the insurgency in the Caucasus Mountains never really ended, Mr. Putin's speech did not convincingly explain how the Kremlin would contend with the economic damage from Western sanctions -- and a simultaneous plunge in oil prices and the ruble.
Mr. Putin sought to portray himself as a leader with Russia's glorious destiny firmly in hand, a viewpoint echoed by his supporters. His critics, however, called the speech way off the mark, if not delusional, with Mr. Putin acknowledging neither the scope of the problems nor his role in creating them.
"He thinks that overall the situation is under control -- the problems with the foreign currency reserves, oil, the budget, the ruble, the economy, inflation and so on -- but the situation is not under control," said Vladimir A. Ryzhkov, an opposition politician. "The country needs surgery, and he proposed therapy."
Standing in the Kremlin's glittering white marble St. George Hall before more than 1,000 members of the country's political elite, Mr. Putin acknowledged that Russia was facing hard times, but reaffirmed the combative foreign policy course he set earlier this year.
In the first part of the 70-minute speech, Mr. Putin adopted the angry, aggrieved tone toward the West that he has used since Russia annexed Crimea in March, blaming the United States for starting the trouble by fomenting a coup in Ukraine. He used a more professorial tone in the second, economic part of the speech, but it proved to be a laundry list of small adjustments, many of them recycled.
In one striking passage, Mr. Putin compared Crimea to the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, saying the peninsula held sacred importance for Russians because the Russian Orthodox Church was born there. Grand Prince Vladimir, considered the ruler who converted the tribes to Christianity, was said to have been baptized near today's modern city of Sevastopol.
Mr. Putin said the West used the annexation as a pretext to continue its historical attempts to restrain Russia.
"The policy of containment was not invented yesterday," he said. "It has been carried out against our country for many years, always, for decades, if not centuries. In short, whenever someone thinks that Russia has become too strong or independent, these tools are quickly put into use."
Evoking World War II history, a favorite device, Mr. Putin suggested attempts to dismember Russia through sanctions and other means would fail just as Adolf Hitler had failed to conquer Russia.
Mr. Putin also stressed that Russia did not want to restore the Iron Curtain, that the country was open to the world and that it would never "pursue paranoia, suspicion and looking for enemies."
That avowal will come as a surprise to some, especially government critics, employees of nongovernmental organizations and others who have been labeled "foreign agents" over the past year by the state-controlled media.
Before moving on to economic policy, Mr. Putin made a passing reference to the attack in Chechnya, but contended that local law enforcement officers could handle it. Still, even as he tried to brush off the most brazen attack there in many years, it was clear Mr. Putin's determination to restore stability was being challenged on yet another front. With his budget already strained, Mr. Putin was again confronted with dedicating resources to Grozny even as he is committed to supplying a not-so-stealth campaign in eastern Ukraine.
While Mr. Putin's resolve appeared strong, his treasury's health was not.
The government conceded for the first time this week that Russia faces a recession next year. The economy is expected to contract by at least 0.8 percent instead of growing by the previously projected 1.2 percent. Independent economists say they believe the contraction could well be 2 or 3 percent. And that is assuming oil prices rebound somewhat from their current level of around $65 a barrel.
The problems have set off an extended fight in the Kremlin, which was already divided over Ukraine. "One school says that Putin will keep the mobilization among the people, the society and the elite despite the economic crisis," Mr. Ryzhkov said. "If he prolongs the policy of greatness, of expansion, of confrontation with the West, he will be popular and supported by the people despite any economic crisis."
But Mr. Ryzhkov and others calling for greater economic and political liberalization doubt that. Mr. Putin enjoyed ever-greater support from March to August, but in the months since, as sanctions began to bite with inflation, support began to erode -- though his approval ratings remain in the 80s.
"I don't believe the Russian people will support him if they lose their medicine, their health benefits, their education and their good standard of living," Mr. Ryzhkov said.
Economists describe the enormous Russian corporate debt, with about $650 billion owed to Western banks, as the worst problem. The sanctions block access to any new Western capital, and it is not clear how the debts can be repaid.
Mr. Putin said Thursday that billions of dollars salted away in one of the government's sovereign wealth funds should be used to prop up domestic banks. Some of Russia's largest banks, including VTB and Gazprombank, have already asked for handouts from the roughly $81 billion sitting in the National Wealth Fund, out of total foreign currency reserves of $420 billion.
Mr. Putin did not say how Russia would close the huge gap between the corporate debts and the reserves. Analysts suggest that the government thinks the sanctions will be lifted in a year so they will not have to find a solution.
Mr. Putin said his country should use the confrontation with the West to try to overhaul its economy, and to depend more on itself for food, medicine and technology. He said there should be a four-year freeze in the business tax rate and proposed that honest small and medium businesses get a reprieve from constant government inspections, a font of corruption.
Over all, analysts said the speech would probably not achieve its main purpose: That is to assure the so-called budgetniki -- people like teachers, doctors and government workers who depend on the federal budget for their salaries -- that growing inflation and the dropping ruble would not undermine their standard of living.
"There are people totally oriented toward the government -- I think that he calmed them down, but they were already calm," said Aleksei V. Makarkin, an analyst at Moscow's Center for Political Technologies.
Everyone else will face a different reality, he said, "From the businessman thinking about how he can continue working under the new conditions to the simple man who goes to the store and sees that prices have risen -- I think that this speech could not have answered all these questions."

Full text:   SÃO PAULO, Brazil -- Interest rates in Brazil would make an American loan shark blush. Credit cards charge more than 240 percent a year. Bank loans top 100 percent.
For a rising number of consumers in need of cash, a pawnshop is actually the better option.
When Angela Pereira, a stay-at-home mother in São Paulo, needed extra money to buy her daughter school supplies, she pawned a gold chain to get 530 reais, or about $210. Adjusting for the country's high inflation, she is paying interest of around 19 percent a year, only modestly higher than what the average American pays on a credit card.
"It's accessible and cheap," she said.
The growing prominence of pawnshops is the latest sign that the country's consumer debt binge may be reaching its limit.
The swelling Brazilian middle class -- and its shopping habits -- helped feed the broader economy for years. But growth is slowing, and consumers are struggling to pay their bills.
The weak economy was a flash point in the recent election, with the incumbent President Dilma Rousseff narrowly winning in a recent runoff. The central bank increased interest rates again, in an effort to fight inflation. But that could weigh on growth and further complicate the consumer debt landscape.
While still a relatively small portion of lending, the pawnshop business has been booming, even as other types of loans have fallen out of favor. Some Brazilians, even those solidly in the middle class, are using pawnshops to pay off their credit cards, cover unexpected expenses or just get a cheaper line of credit.
Unlike in the United States, pawnshops in Brazil are regulated at the national level. Instead of being independent players that set their own rates and make their own rules, pawnshops are operated by a government-owned bank, Caixa Econômica Federal.
The strict oversight is the legacy of the former Brazilian President Getúlio Vargas, a strongman who took power in the 1930s in a military coup and showed sympathy for European fascism. But he also introduced progressive reforms, including the eight-hour workday. As part of his attempt to lower interest rates, he abolished private pawnshops in 1934 and gave the monopoly to Caixa.
Like those of any other bank, Caixa's branches have walls of A.T.M.s; desks for new savings accounts, mortgages and loans; and rows of tellers for deposits and withdrawals. But in 463 of Caixa's branch offices, one row of tellers has scales and jewelers' kits to weigh and test precious metals, jewels and luxury watches.
After the inspection, the teller immediately offers a loan, generally equal to 85 percent of the item's value. The teller does not ask about employment, income or credit history -- just name, address and tax ID number.
João Régis Magalhães, Caixa's national superintendent of consumer finance, said it was logical that pawn loans should charge lower interest rates than other loans: "The operation is simple, so we have very few costs, and the risk is very low because we have a guarantee that we will get our money back."
The growth in pawnshop lending in some ways follows the broader boom in household debt. From June 2004 to June 2014, consumer credit in Brazil rose 658 percent to $297 billion, according to the country's National Association of Executives in Finance, Administration and Accounting. Caixa's pawn loan portfolio has more than doubled in the last four years to $670 million, with 1.3 million loans outstanding.
The fallout from the credit binge has been more painful for other types of loans. The central bank reports that 6.7 percent of personal bank loans and 26.3 percent of credit card accounts are in default. By comparison, Caixa said that only 0.6 percent of pawn customers missed their payments.
While other types of lending have slowed, pawn loans continue to rise rapidly. Caixa is planning to double the number of branches that offer such loans by the end of 2015.
Marianne Hanson, an economist with the National Confederation of Commerce, said many low-income households, for whom credit was a novelty a few years ago, "are now learning how interest works and that they have to look for the cheapest alternative." Credit that requires some kind of collateral, like a pawn loan, fits that bill, she said. And even middle-class households are turning to pawnshops to try to break the cycle of debt.
At the start of the decade, Arianna França, an event coordinator for the São Paulo state court system, faced a medical emergency. Her father's health insurance did not cover all the procedures needed to treat his cancer.
As a civil servant, Ms. França has the option to use so-called consigned credit. On such loans, the borrower's employer automatically deducts the amount owed each month from the borrower's paycheck, and the rate is about the same as on pawn loans.
But like many other civil servants and pensioners, Ms. França was already spending more than 30 percent of her income on consigned-credit payments -- the limit permitted by law. "There's so much credit available, you can just buy and buy. It can become a problem," she said.
Her credit cards were soon maxed out, too. Brazilian credit cards' minimum monthly payments are often not large enough to keep the amount owed from growing.
So two years ago, she pawned her jewels and raised 40,000 reais to pay off her credit cards. The interest is low enough that she is now paying down her principal and expects to have her jewels back next year.
While pawn loans can provide a much needed lifeline, they also pose risks.
For years, Valéria Ferraz, a holistic therapist in São Paulo, has pawned her jewels to help pay the bills when business is slow, then redeemed them when clients return.
"It becomes addictive," she said. "It's so easy to get extra money, sometimes I do it even if I don't really need it."
Ms. Ferraz admitted that she had once lost a gold ring with diamonds because she had failed to make her interest payments.
When a consumer defaults, Caixa displays the pawned item on its website. Interested parties bid through the bank's A.T.M.s. If the amount raised in the auction is greater than what the client owes, the client receives the difference. But because Caixa values jewels based only on their raw materials, without taking craftsmanship into account, the auction price rarely reflects the full value.
Reinaldo Domingos, president of the Brazilian Association of Financial Educators, said pawn loans might be cheaper than other options but they are still not cheap. "For many people, the snowball of debt keeps growing," he said.
Yet for those who keep their borrowing under control, pawn loans can replace high-interest credit cards.
Carmelita Valente, a retired administrative assistant in São Paulo, pawned rings, necklaces, a pendant and earrings to help with household expenses just after her husband died in 1992. Since then, Ms. Valente has never defaulted. But she also has not redeemed her valuables. Instead, for the last 22 years, she has used her pawn account as a line of credit.
Based on her items' value, Caixa lets her borrow up to 4,000 reais, but it is a rare month that she owes that whole sum. "A few months ago I had some money, so I paid off 1,200 reais. Last month I took out 600 to pay for repairs in my home. It depends on what I need each month," Ms. Valente said. She currently owes 2,300 reais.
She says she knows that it would be best not to borrow at all. "My daughter always tells me that I'm just supporting the bank," she said. Her income, though, does not let her save for unexpected expenses.
"But with God's help, I'll redeem my things, someday," she said. "I couldn't bear to let them go. They're part of my family history."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Abstract: The number of investigators in the Wage and Hour Division has increased to 1,040 from 731 in 2008, the Labor Department said. Since 2009 the department has recovered $1 billion in back wages for workers who suffered minimum-wage and other violations.

Full text:   The United States Labor Department says that a new study shows that between 3.5 and 6.5 percent of all the wage and salary workers in California and New York are paid less than the minimum wage.
The study, which examined work force data for the two states, found that more than 300,000 workers in each state suffered minimum-wage violations each month. Labor Department officials said that even if one assumed a violation rate half that nationwide, that would mean more than two million workers across the nation were paid less than the federal or state minimum wage.
Violations were most common in the restaurant and hotel industries, the study found, followed by educational and health services and retail and wholesale.
"These findings are alarming in terms of the prevalence of the problem, particularly in a set of industries where we already know workers earn low wages and struggle to earn a basic family budget," said David Weil, administrator of the Labor Department's Wage and Hour Division.
The minimum-wage violations in those two states translate into $20 million to $29 million in lost income per week, the study concluded. Those amounts represent 38 percent of the income of the victimized workers in New York and 49 percent of the income of victimized workers in California.
The study was based on 2011 data, when the minimum wage in New York was $7.25 an hour and $8 an hour in California. The study found that 11 percent of low-wage workers suffered minimum-wage violations -- it defined low-wage workers as those making less than 1.5 times the minimum wage (meaning workers making nearly $11 in New York at the time of the study and $12 in California).
The current federal minimum wage is $7.25 an hour, while the minimum in New York is $8 and in California $9.
The study was done for the Labor Department by the Eastern Research Group, a consulting firm in Lexington, Mass. It relied on data from the Census Bureau's current Population Survey and the Survey of Income and Program Participation.
"Younger workers are significantly more likely to be illegally paid below the minimum wage than older workers," said the study, "The Social and Economic Effects of Wage Violations." "Violation rates tend to be slightly lower for men than women."
Mr. Weil said the nation was in a long-term period during which labor standards and wage compliance have eroded. "It's unfortunate that we're finding these violations when the minimum wage is at its lowest level in a long, long time," after factoring in inflation, he said.
The study said these pay violations ended up costing taxpayers. As a rest of the violations, school breakfast and lunch programs spent an additional $15.6 million in California and $7.8 million in New York in fiscal 2011, the report said. And annual spending on food stamps rose nearly $11 million in California and $33.6 million in New York because of the violations.
In a speech prepared for delivery on Thursday, Tom Perez, the labor secretary, pledges stepped-up enforcement against such violations. "The law is only as effective as the political will of those enforcing," says the text, which is to be given at a conference on wage enforcement at the Center for American Progress in Washington.
The number of investigators in the Wage and Hour Division has increased to 1,040 from 731 in 2008, the Labor Department said. Since 2009 the department has recovered $1 billion in back wages for workers who suffered minimum-wage and other violations.
Mr. Perez said most employers complied with wage laws, but that bad actors put pressure on others to break the law.
"When we crack down on unscrupulous employers, we send a strong message to similar employers about our vigilance," his speech text says. "We create ripple effects, as a single investigation can resonate throughout that sector, influencing employer behavior and reforming a race-to-the-bottom culture."
In recent years, workers have brought a flood of lawsuits accusing their employers of paying them less than the minimum wage and failing to pay overtime. For instance, Guadalupe Salazar, a cashier at a McDonald's in Oakland, Calif., said her paychecks repeatedly missed a few hours of work time and overtime pay, sometimes bringing her overall pay below the minimum wage. She has joined one of several lawsuits against McDonald's and several of its franchise operators, asserting that workers were cheated out of overtime, some of their hours were erased from timecards and they had to work off the clock.
McDonald's denied any liability in Ms. Salazar's case, and the Oakland franchisee insisted that Ms. Salazar had failed to establish illegal actions by the restaurant.
The study found that according to the Current Population Survey, 7,000 families in California and 8,000 in New York lived below the poverty line because of minimum-wage violations. But data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation showed a larger impact, estimating that 41,000 families in California and 26,000 in New York fell below the poverty line because of those violations.

Abstract: Financial experts say Russia's most pressing problem is not the sinking ruble, despite its potential to prompt a run on the banks, nor the falling price of oil, though the annual budget was based on a price of $96 per barrel, which is now hovering around $70.

Full text:   MOSCOW -- President Vladimir V. Putin grew wildly popular by making Russians richer every year and by vowing to restore their country's great power status. But now, with the government predicting Tuesday that the battered economy will fall into recession next year, that formula is in jeopardy.
Every day brings a barrage of woeful economic news. World oil prices just hit a five-year low. The Russian ruble is down 40 percent against the dollar so far in 2014. Inflation is due to rise 9 percent this year and to continue climbing. Capital flight is expected to reach $128 billion.
The Kremlin suffered the collapse of the Soviet state and a government default during previous extended declines in oil prices, so the changing fortunes potentially pose extreme challenges. Experts underscore, however, that the country is far more resilient now than in the 1980s or in 1998, the previous times of crisis, particularly its stout private sector.
Mr. Putin has already shelved planned megaprojects, like the South Stream pipeline to ship gas to southern Europe, which was canceled on Monday, and a high-speed railway from Moscow to Kazan, a city east of the capital.
Some analysts say the changes may be felt in the policy area, where Mr. Putin may feel compelled to tone down his aggressive, anti-Western stance. But others worry that he may do just the opposite, saying that his need to divert attention from economic problems might inspire further nationalistic adventures abroad, akin to the annexation of Crimea.
"It is a completely new reality for him," Sergei M. Guriev, a prominent economist who fled into exile last year, said of Mr. Putin. "Whenever Russia wanted the oil price to go up, it has gone up. He has always been lucky, and this time he is not lucky."
Russia is heavily dependent on oil, which constitutes some 60 percent of its exports. With the collapse in prices coinciding with severe economic turbulence caused by Western sanctions over destabilizing Ukraine, Mr. Putin risks losing the engine that was supposed to power Russia back onto the world stage.
Financial experts say Russia's most pressing problem is not the sinking ruble, despite its potential to prompt a run on the banks, nor the falling price of oil, though the annual budget was based on a price of $96 per barrel, which is now hovering around $70.
"This is all peanuts compared to the financing crisis," said Vladimir Milov, a former deputy energy minister turned opposition politician.
Nearly $700 billion is owed to Western banks, economists said, much of it by the giant state-run companies that constitute the heart of the Russian economy. But sanctions imposed by the United States and Europe over Russia's annexation of Crimea and adventurism in southeastern Ukraine have blocked access to Western financing.
Despite Moscow's plans to turn East as an alternative, China's banks just do not have the capacity. Instead, the debt threatens to drain the Kremlin of its $400 billion in foreign currency reserves.
Among the companies with their hands out are Rosneft, Novatek, VTB Bank, Rusnano and Russian Railways, asking for sums well beyond the $90 billion held by the National Welfare Fund, a sovereign wealth fund for rainy days.
Mr. Putin has yet to express publicly how he expects Russia to emerge from its financial problems. At a news conference last month, he addressed concerns about oil by saying that prices had been high enough in the first part of 2014 to finance much of the Russian budget, and that the country would just have to "wait and see" about next year.
He also tried to portray the large drop in value of the ruble as useful. "We used to sell by the dollar and get 32 or 35 rubles in return, but if you look at today's exchange rate, we get 45, 47 or 48 rubles for every dollar's worth of what we sell," he said, and the ruble has reached 54 to the dollar since Mr. Putin spoke. "In that sense, budget revenue has even increased."
Vedomosti, the main business daily, published an excoriating editorial on Tuesday comparing Mr. Putin to President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, who the editorial said did basically nothing as the exchange rate there fell to four trillion Zimbabwe dollars for one American dollar.
While noting that Russia was in far better shape, the editorial said that "the biggest problem of Russian leadership is inability to admit mistakes."
"The economy is seriously ill, and the ruble rate is one of the indicators crying about the illness," the editorial said. "Russia's leadership refuses to admit there is an illness and pushes it into the depths."
Anton Siluanov, the Russian finance minister, called the report predicting a recession a "preliminary assessment" and said it had not been approved by the entire cabinet. Mr. Siluanov also argued that the ruble was now undervalued after its long slide.
Mr. Putin is due to deliver his annual State of the Nation speech on Thursday, and there has been much speculation that he will announce more liberal or more centralized economic policies. Some economists think that the policy is essentially to wait out the sanctions, with the Kremlin anticipating that they will expire in a year and that then all the financial problems will diminish.
The crisis is still likely to force significant cuts in public spending. The Ministry of Economic Development, which publishes the government's economic outlook, on Tuesday revised its 2015 forecast to show a contraction of 0.8 percent, compared with a previous projection of 1.2 percent growth. Private assessments said there could be a drop of 2 percent.
The setbacks have slowed or eliminated goals to achieve higher wages, better health care and cheaper housing, ambitions laid out in a series of populist decrees Mr. Putin signed on his first day in office for a third term, in 2012.
The 11 decrees described a "transformation strategy for society" for his new six-year term, including creating 25 million "highly productive" jobs, raising life expectancy to 74 years and raising the birthrate.
"Russia is in an economic crisis," said Kirill Rogov, an independent economic analyst. "Of course, all those grand plans are irrelevant now."
It is impossible to predict whether the economic woes might inspire antigovernment demonstrations. There have been minor protests in Moscow by medical professionals denouncing the closure of about 28 clinics in the capital and the dismissal of 10,000 medical staff members.
But the effects of the economic crisis are just starting. Once constituents like pensioners realize the ruble is losing its purchasing power, they can be expected to demand raises so they can buy as much as before. But state companies will be first in line.
"The problem is that he cannot deliver on his economic promises, so he has to deliver on post-imperial nostalgia," Mr. Guriev said of Mr. Putin. "He will say that we are not rich anymore, but we are at least feared."
The annexation of Crimea lifted Mr. Putin's ratings into the stratosphere, raising concerns that he might try similar moves elsewhere, like Moldova, to distract people if the economic crisis deepens.
The crisis and three rounds of Western sanctions seem to have produced a distinct shift in the propaganda on state television and elsewhere, from triumphalism to a determination that Russians are ready to make any kind of sacrifice to win a showdown with the United States.
A billboard on the main Sadova ring road around Moscow recently proclaimed, "There are more important things in life than the financial market," and made references to Russian history.
"They are moving from greatness to suffering hardship, because we are fighting American domination," Mr. Milov said. "It is a totally different definition of the mission."

Abstract: Has French competitiveness been eroded by excessive growth in costs and prices? Since the euro came into existence in 1999, France's G.D.P. deflator (the average price of French-produced goods and services) has risen 1.7 percent per year, while its unit labor costs have risen 1.9 percent annually. Spain saw rising costs and prices during the housing bubble, but at this point all the excess has been eliminated through years of crushing unemployment and wage restraint.

Full text:   The U.S. economy finally seems to be climbing out of the deep hole it entered during the global financial crisis. Unfortunately, Europe, the other epicenter of crisis, can't say the same. Unemployment in the euro area is stalled at almost twice the U.S. level, while inflation is far below both the official target and outright deflation has become a looming risk.
Investors have taken notice: European interest rates have plunged, with German long-term bonds yielding just 0.7 percent. That's the kind of yield we used to associate with Japanese deflation, and markets are indeed signaling that they expect Europe to experience its own lost decade.
Why is Europe in such dire straits? The conventional wisdom among European policy makers is that we're looking at the price of irresponsibility: Some governments have failed to behave with the prudence a shared currency requires, choosing instead to pander to misguided voters and cling to failed economic doctrines. And if you ask me (and a number of other economists who have looked hard at the issue), this analysis is essentially right, except for one thing: They've got the identity of the bad actors wrong.
For the bad behavior at the core of Europe's slow-motion disaster isn't coming from Greece, or Italy, or France. It's coming from Germany.
I'm not denying that the Greek government behaved irresponsibly before the crisis, or that Italy has a big problem with stagnating productivity. But Greece is a small country whose fiscal mess is unique, while Italy's long-run problems aren't the source of Europe's deflationary downdraft. If you try to identify countries whose policies were way out of line before the crisis and have hurt Europe since the crisis, and that refuse to learn from experience, everything points to Germany as the worst actor.
Consider, in particular, the comparison between Germany and France.
France gets a lot of bad press, with much talk in particular about its supposed loss in competitiveness. Such talk greatly exaggerates the reality; you'd never know from most media reports that France runs only a small trade deficit. Still, to the extent that there is an issue here, where does it come from? Has French competitiveness been eroded by excessive growth in costs and prices?
No, not at all. Since the euro came into existence in 1999, France's G.D.P. deflator (the average price of French-produced goods and services) has risen 1.7 percent per year, while its unit labor costs have risen 1.9 percent annually. Both numbers are right in line with the European Central Bank's target of slightly under 2 percent inflation, and similar to what has happened in the United States. Germany, on the other hand, is way out of line, with price and labor-cost growth of 1 and 0.5 percent, respectively.
And it's not just France whose costs are just about where they ought to be. Spain saw rising costs and prices during the housing bubble, but at this point all the excess has been eliminated through years of crushing unemployment and wage restraint. Italian cost growth has arguably been a bit too high, but it's not nearly as far out of line as Germany is on the low side.
In other words, to the extent that there's anything like a competitiveness problem in Europe, it's overwhelmingly caused by Germany's beggar-thy-neighbor policies, which are in effect exporting deflation to its neighbors.
But what about debt? Isn't non-German Europe paying the price for past fiscal irresponsibility? Actually, that's a story about Greece and nobody else. And it's especially wrong in the case of France, which isn't facing a fiscal crisis at all; France can currently borrow long-term at a record low interest rate of less than 1 percent, only slightly above the German rate.
Yet European policy makers seem determined to blame the wrong countries and the wrong policies for their plight. True, the European Commission has floated a plan to stimulate the economy with public investment -- but the public outlay is so tiny compared with the problem that the plan is almost a joke. And meanwhile, the commission is warning France, which has the lowest borrowing costs in its history, that it may face fines for not cutting its budget deficit enough.
What about resolving the problem of too little inflation in Germany? Very aggressive monetary policy might do the trick (although I wouldn't count on it), but German monetary officials are warning against such policies because they might let debtors off the hook.
What we're seeing, then, is the immensely destructive power of bad ideas. It's not entirely Germany's fault -- Germany is a big player in Europe, but it's only able to impose deflationary policies because so much of the European elite has bought into the same false narrative. And you have to wonder what will cause reality to break in.

Full text:   HOUSTON -- Since the economically crippling oil embargo of 1973, every American president has pledged to seek and achieve energy independence.
That elusive goal may finally have arrived, at least for the foreseeable future, with the failure of Saudi Arabia and its 11 oil cartel partners in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to agree to a production cut that would put a brake on plummeting crude prices.
On Friday, the benchmark American price for crude oil continued the free fall that began on Thursday, closing at $66.15, its lowest price in more than four years.
The inability or unwillingness of OPEC to act showed that the cartel was no longer the dominating producer whose decisions determine global supplies and prices. Suddenly, the United States -- which is poised to surpass Saudi Arabia as the world's top producer, possibly in a matter of months -- is in that position, although the resiliency of that new command must still be tested.
"This is a historic turning point," said Daniel Yergin, the energy historian. "The defining force now in world oil today is the growth of U.S. production. The outcome of the OPEC meeting is a clear indication that the oil exporters now recognize that this is a new market."
For decades, the United States faced dwindling domestic production and rising demand, leading President George W. Bush to call on the country to get off its "addiction" to imported oil. But around eight years ago a few small oil companies began experimenting to produce oil from hard shale rocks in North Dakota and Texas, using hydraulic fracturing -- fracking -- and horizontal drilling techniques that proved effective in producing natural gas a few years earlier.
Domestic oil production has soared more 70 percent over the last six years, to roughly nine million barrels a day. The country is still a net importer, but with production growing by more than a million barrels a day every year, it is importing less and less almost every month.
Imports from OPEC producers have been cut by more than a half in recent years, forcing increasing competition among Saudi Arabia and other exporting countries seeking to replace the American market with Chinese and other Asian markets. That has produced more cracks in an organization in which competition between Saudi Arabia and Iran is already fierce.
That remarkable global turnaround has been a windfall for the United States, helping keep inflation in check, lower the trade deficit, strengthen the American dollar and bring relief to consumers.
On Friday, Americans paid an average of $2.79 a gallon for regular gasoline, according to the AAA motor club, nearly 50 cents less than a year ago.
For David Goldwyn, the State Department's coordinator for international energy affairs in the first Obama administration, OPEC's decision not to cut was "strategic ."
"What we have now is a yearlong game of chicken," he said. "The Saudis are waiting to see how much U.S. production adjusts because of prices and they are waiting to see how much pain the other major oil producers can take before they are willing to make meaningful cuts." Referring to the global oil benchmark, he added, "If Brent sinks below $60, I think you will see OPEC hit the panic button pretty fast." That would mean an extraordinary OPEC meeting, and emergency cuts in production.
The Brent price has fallen more than a third since June and closed on Friday at $70.15 a barrel.
For OPEC producers like Venezuela and Iran, the tumbling price in oil has produced economic hardship and potential political problems.
Venezuela and Algeria contend that OPEC needed to band to together to cut production and raise prices. But Saudi Arabia has by far the most sway in OPEC, since the kingdom produces roughly one-third of OPEC output alone. It also has the financial muscle and spare capacity to lower or raise production whenever the Saudi royal family deems necessary.
Saudi Arabia resisted calls for lower production mainly because the countries that were most vociferous in calling for cuts would be the countries least able to actually cut their production since their cash-short governments are dependent on more, not less oil revenue.
And there was no guarantee that a cut in OPEC production would raise prices. Even if it did, that would only encourage more American output. So far, United States oil production has proved resilient no matter the price.
Even as prices slid in October, production in the Bakken shale field in North Dakota and the Eagle Ford field in Texas -- the two primary promoters of the American oil production boom -- increased more than 3 percent over the month before.
That is because American producers keep improving the efficiency and output of their wells with new technology, and because in the short run, lower prices can actually encourage companies to produce more to pay debts and dividends.
Energy experts caution that there is no guarantee that the United States will permanently keep its new powerful edge on world markets. Eventually, low oil prices will drive down production in higher-cost fields, drive marginal companies that are deeply in debt out of business and encourage major companies to slow down their investment in new wells. Several companies have already shaved their 2015 exploration budgets.
And OPEC has been weakened before, only to stage a comeback. The cartel is still able to produce about a third of the global oil market.
After the oil price spikes of the 1970s, the United States and other industrialized countries raised their strategic reserves, put into effect conservation policies and incentivized oil production. New output from places like Alaska and the North Sea in the 1980s helped produce a glut, sending oil prices plummeting. Saudi Arabia lobbied its OPEC partners for production quota cuts, and the kingdom cut its own production. When other OPEC members failed to comply with the new quotas, prices collapsed in 1986, and Saudi Arabia lost valuable markets for years to come.
OPEC has never completely regained the power it once had, but in the early 2000s, oil prices spiked again primarily because of the rapid growth in demand from China and other developing countries and increasing unrest in several oil-producing countries like Nigeria and Venezuela. With the oil market growing tighter, Saudi Arabia expanded its spare capacity and kept a lid on spiraling prices.
An equilibrium price of around $100 a barrel kept producing and consuming countries reasonably happy. But now the United States production, combined with slowing economic activity in China and Europe, have broken the balance.
"OPEC still has power in that they can still cut production and raise price if they choose to do so," said Michael C. Lynch, president of Strategic Energy and Economic Research and sometimes an adviser to OPEC. But he added, "They don't have the same power they once did because so many of the members are in bad financial condition and so it's harder for them to cut production and lose revenues in the short term to raise prices."

Full text:   PARIS -- The eurozone inflation rate is slipping toward zero, even as the job market remains moribund, official data showed on Friday, highlighting the weak demand at the heart of the bloc's economy and posing a test of the European Central Bank's pledge to head off deflation.
Consumer prices in the 18-nation euro currency area rose just 0.3 percent in November from a year earlier, according to Eurostat, the European Union's statistical agency, slipping from the 0.4 percent increase reported in October.
Eurostat said in a separate release that the eurozone jobless rate was 11.5 percent in October, unchanged from September. For the 28-member European Union as a whole, the jobless rate was unchanged at 10 percent, Eurostat said, with about 24.4 million people out of work, including nearly five million young people.
"The data show that the Japanification of the eurozone continues apace," said Nicholas Spiro, managing director of Spiro Sovereign Strategy in London, referring to the low inflation and economic stagnation that have been the hallmarks of the Japanese economy for much of the last two decades.
"The claim of the European Central Bank that inflation expectations are still anchored is a pipe dream," Mr. Spiro said. "Markets are anticipating outright deflation" -- an actual contraction in the Consumer Price Index -- "in the new year."
The unemployment rate in Italy, the third-largest economy in the eurozone, rose in October to 13.2 percent, the highest since at least 1977, according to a report on Friday from the Italian statistical agency Istat.
Unemployment rates vary widely across Europe. Greece, with a jobless rate near 26 percent, and Spain, at 24 percent, are experiencing depression-level conditions, reflecting the damage to their economies from the combination of the credit crisis and budget austerity.
At the other end of the scale, Germany's jobless rate of 4.9 percent reflects a relatively strong environment in Europe's largest economy, as well as labor market innovations like work-sharing that ensure that many more people are counted as employed. France lies in between, at 10.5 percent.
The inflation and jobless figures were in line with market expectations. The euro was little changed against the dollar.
The eurozone has already proved itself ill equipped to deal with continuing stagnation, and it must now reckon with the danger that low inflation will tip into outright deflation. That would further sap demand and add stress to borrowers and lenders, because the cost of repaying loans rises in real terms when prices decline.
Europe's malaise has raised alarms in Washington, where officials fear that the United States economy, while relatively strong, cannot carry the weight of global growth alone. The eurozone accounts for about a quarter of global gross domestic product, but it has been unable to muster a policy response sufficient to restore its economic health in the years since the financial crisis began.
Europe is not alone in its struggle with what International Monetary Fund economists are calling "lowflation," or ultralow price pressures. The Bank of Japan has greatly expanded its program of bond buying, to pump money into the economy in an effort to raise the inflation rate. And in the United States, the Federal Reserve has signaled its own concern about the risk of deflation.
One contributor to low inflation is the decline in energy prices in recent months. Oil on Friday remained near four-year lows, the day after OPEC decided not to try to reverse the price plunge by curtailing production.
Most economists agree that falling energy prices are a boon for businesses and consumers because the less spent on heating or transportation costs, the more is available for spending or investing. The question, over time, is whether that stimulus effect will be enough to keep the overall inflation rate from falling to dangerously low levels.
Eurostat on Friday noted that energy costs were down 2.5 percent in November. But even considering that, the so-called core inflation rate -- which strips out the prices of energy and food -- came in at just 0.7 percent in November, the same as October.
The European Central Bank seeks to hold inflation to just under 2 percent, but prices have fallen short of that since early last year. In September, it cut its main interest rate target to 0.05 percent and its deposit rate to minus 0.2 percent, a de facto "tax" on banks seeking to keep excess reserves with the central bank.
Many economists say the most important tool left in the central bank's kit is so-called quantitative easing -- the outright buying in bulk of bonds, including sovereign debt. That policy has been used, with varying levels of success, by the Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan.
The European Central Bank has been loath to commit to it, though, because of questions about its efficacy in a currency union with 18 sovereign nations and because of institutional resistance from Germany, where it would most likely be met with legal challenges. The bank's governing council will meet on Thursday to discuss policy.
Mario Draghi, the central bank president, said last week that the bank was determined to "do what we must" to stop insufficient inflation from taking hold.
Speaking on Thursday at a conference in Helsinki, Finland, he noted that the bank had already taken a number of unorthodox measures intended to restore credit and raise prices, including by providing financial institutions with longer-term loans at rock-bottom rates and by buying asset-backed securities on the open market.
But "should it become necessary to further address risks of too prolonged a period of low inflation," he added, "the governing council is unanimous in its commitment to using additional unconventional instruments within its mandate."
In a pointed reference to quantitative easing, he added that central bank staff members had been instructed to be ready "with the timely preparation of further measures to be implemented, if needed."
For all the importance of monetary matters, Europe's fundamental problem is a lack of demand. Gross domestic product is made up of private consumption, business investment, government spending and net exports. In the current climate, none of those look capable, for reasons of confidence or ideology, of lifting the economy.
Most of the news lately has been discouraging. A survey of eurozone purchasing managers last week showed activity decelerating from already low levels. And a central bank report on credit conditions showed on Thursday that lending to the private sector shrank by 1.1 percent on an annual basis in October, continuing a more than two-year decline.
Clemente De Lucia, an economist at BNP Paribas, estimated that the eurozone had an output gap of about 3 percent, meaning the economy is operating that much below its potential. He said he expected it to remain at that level through next year, shrinking to 2 percent in 2016.
That would be bad news for the central bank, he wrote in a research note, because until that gap starts to close, price pressures are likely to remain weak.
Analysts are divided over whether the central bank will act next week, but there is plenty of evidence that investors are placing their bets now, piling into eurozone government bonds on expectations that the bank will soon follow.
As investors scoop up those bonds, prices have risen, and yields, which move in the opposite direction of price, have tumbled across Europe. As a result, France and Germany can currently borrow 10-year funds at below 1 percent; even Italy and Spain, which only a few years ago were looking at terms too onerous to repay, can now borrow at around 2 percent.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text:   At their policy meeting in October, Federal Reserve officials were blasé about economic weakness in Asia and Europe. According to the minutes of the meeting, the Fed noted that growth in the United States "might be" slower than anticipated in the next year or two if global conditions were to deteriorate further.
Since then, Japan has fallen back into recession. China has cut interest rates in an attempt to counter waning growth. And Europe, even under prodding from the pope, has backed off only slightly from brutal and counterproductive austerity policies that have long undermined its ailing economy.
The United States is not immune to the malaise. Already, global weakness has cast a pall on otherwise upbeat economic data. The government reported this week that the economy grew at an annualized rate of 3.9 percent from July through September, up from an earlier estimate of 3.5 percent. But business survey data and economic statistics from October suggest slower growth going forward -- about 2.5 percent annualized in the fourth quarter -- as American companies trim production, investment and hiring in response to weakness elsewhere.
At that pace, the United States is not strong enough to pull other countries out of their troubles. Nor is it strong enough to withstand a prolonged global slump.
It is baffling that the Fed would dismiss those dangers, especially in light of recent history, in which global interdependencies in finance, trade and politics have made it difficult for policy makers to shield their domestic economies from weakness and turmoil elsewhere.
The Fed's attitude is also puzzling given its justifiable worry that inflation is too low -- a condition that depresses wages and employment and, in general, reflects deep-seated problems. Economic slowdowns abroad and relatively better conditions in the United States will keep inflation at a low level because they will foster a stronger dollar, which holds prices down. A stronger dollar is also a headwind for American exporters, because it gives foreign rivals a competitive edge in world markets. Those negative effects, however, can take longer to be felt.
Meanwhile, the American economy will be fueled by its relative strength and by lower oil prices, which buoy consumer spending. But unless jobs, wages and growth improve fundamentally, both here and abroad, the economy looks set to slow again in mid- to late 2015.
Now is not the time to be sanguine. The Fed needs to delay further reduction in monetary stimulus until signs of sustained recovery are clear. Congress needs to spend more, mainly on infrastructure, to create jobs in the near term and lay the foundation for future growth. The economy is still far from healed.

Full text:   If there were any remaining doubts that "making money is art," as Andy Warhol famously pronounced in his 1975 book, "The Philosophy of Andy Warhol," they were surely vanquished on Nov. 12. His silk-screen print "Triple Elvis (Ferus Type)," an image taken from a Hollywood studio publicity shot showing Elvis Presley with a gun, sold for nearly $82 million at a Christie's auction packed with bankers, hedge fund managers and art dealers.
In just two weeks this month in New York, the auction houses Sotheby's and Christie's sold over $2 billion in art, a record for major New York fall auctions. The billionaire investor Steven A. Cohen paid over $100 million for a Giacometti sculpture. A Manet sold for $65 million, two by Mark Rothko for $45 million and nearly $40 million, a Georgia O'Keeffe for $44 million and a small Jasper Johns American flag for $36 million.
The lofty sums stunned even longtime art market watchers. "It's phenomenal," said Michael Moses, a founder of the Mei Moses Fine Art Index, a widely followed measure of art prices, and a retired professor at the New York University Stern School of Business. "At the Christie's postmodern and contemporary sale, the average compound return was 20 percent annualized. That's amazing."
For better or worse, fine art is now firmly planted alongside equities, bonds, commodities and real estate as an asset class. Financial terms like "compounded rates of return" have elbowed their way into the traditional vocabulary of connoisseurship even as art's old guard has trouble with the word "sell." ("Deacquisition" is preferred.)
This month's record sales left some dealers and collectors talking about irrational exuberance and a potential bubble, especially in the soaring contemporary-art market. But Evan Beard, who leads Deloitte's art and finance practice in the United States, said he didn't agree. "If you were seeing second-rate works selling for huge values, then you'd say there's dumb money out there," he said. "But the works selling for these high multiples are important works that art historians have deemed innovative and have had influence. People want to own original works of genius."
Mr. Moses said that it was hard to describe the art market as exuberant, when overall returns -- about 3.5 percent annually -- have barely outpaced inflation and have trailed equities and, in recent years, even fixed income. He noted that it was contemporary and postwar works that had shown the biggest gains. "The single most surprising change in the art market is the relative increase in the value of recent art," said David Galenson, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago who has done groundbreaking research into valuations in the art market.
While some art historians, curators and dealers bemoan the emergence of fine art as just another economic asset class, "art and money have always been joined by an umbilical cord of gold," Professor Galenson said. "The Renaissance ideal has gone the way of the dodo bird. I say, Get over it. Steven Cohen doesn't make any pretense of being an art history major. Maybe he's the Andy Warhol of collectors."
In a recent survey of art professionals by Deloitte, 76 percent said collectors viewed art, at least in part, as an investment -- up from 53 percent two years ago. And 72 percent said their clients' primary reason for buying art was related to the "social and networking scene" and the status associated with buying art, compared with 59 percent in 2012.
Given the money involved, it probably shouldn't be surprising that bankers are treating art like any other asset class, which, in turn, is helping drive up prices and create a more liquid market. More banks are lending against art as collateral. Some are even starting to create collateralized debt obligations with art as the underlying asset -- much as bankers packaged subprime mortgages before the financial crisis.
John Arena, senior credit executive for fine art at U.S. Trust, said the bank had a long track record in art lending and had billions outstanding in loans guaranteed by art. "Contemporary and postwar art is the driving force," he said. "The trajectory has gotten steeper, and the loan requests have gotten much higher. In contemporary art, you're dealing with a younger generation of collectors, who are comfortable with the economic aspects of their art. They're leveraging it and using it to take advantage of other investment opportunities, while still being able to enjoy it and keep it on their walls."
He said U.S. Trust would lend up to 50 percent of a work's appraised value but that it wasn't packaging the loans into C.D.O.s. "I've heard people are doing that," he said. "But it scares me. That's not our game."
The soaring prices are being driven by market forces rather than any aesthetic or artistic awakening, Professor Galenson said. "Aesthetics have nothing to do with it."
What does matter, Professor Galenson's research suggests, is innovation by the artist. "It's really incredibly simple," he said. "Valuable paintings are innovative. Valuable artists are innovators. Cézanne did his most influential work at the very end of his career, Picasso at the very beginning, when he invented Cubism. Nineteen sixty-two is when Warhol started using mechanical reproductions and photography and reinvented modern art. His works from the 1960s are the very most expensive. Those from the 1980s are much less."
Mr. Beard, of Deloitte, said he found Professor Galenson's research persuasive. "That you saw the 'Triple Elvis' sell for so much has nothing to do with its aesthetic value or coolness or hipness and everything to do with the fact that historians agree that Warhol with this work influenced art history," he said.
In this respect, the auction catalog may be more important to a work's value than the art itself. Monet's portrait of Alice Hoschedé may be very beautiful, but its sales price of $33.8 million represents a compounded rate of return of just 5.4 percent since its last sale, according to Mr. Moses. And for Impressionist and modern works as a whole, the average was only 3.9 percent.
By comparison, consider the work of the Japanese artist Kazuo Shiraga, who died in 2008 after becoming a Buddhist monk. Mr. Shiraga is hardly a household name, and he didn't figure in the headlines from this month's sales. But his "BB56" sold for $4.9 million, which represents the single best compounded rate of return -- 53 percent -- of any work sold this month, according to Mr. Moses' calculations. (The work last sold at auction in 2008 for a little over $300,000.)
The description of the work from Christie's catalog hits all of Professor Galenson's benchmarks.
It's innovative: "Painted directly with the artist's feet as he suspended himself above the canvas from a rope hanging from the ceiling, the painting represents a unity of the central tenets of postwar abstraction with performance art."
And it's from the most influential period of the artist's work: "Painted in 1961, 'BB56' dates from a highly significant time for the artist," the catalog description says, adding that 1962 "was the year in which Shiraga was given his first solo show outside Japan, at the Galerie Stadler in Paris, where this painting was exhibited."
That it may look, to some, like a child's finger painting is irrelevant. "A lot of contemporary art is aggressively ugly," Professor Galenson said. "That doesn't matter in terms of its value."

Abstract: The average price of an individual New York City taxi medallion fell to $872,000 in October, down 17 percent from a peak reached in the spring of 2013, according to an analysis of sales data. Previous figures published by the city's Taxi and Limousine Commission -- showing flat prices -- appear to have been incorrect, and the commission removed them from its website after an inquiry from The New York Times.

Full text:   In major cities throughout the United States, taxi medallion prices are tumbling as taxis face competition from car-service apps like Uber and Lyft.
The average price of an individual New York City taxi medallion fell to $872,000 in October, down 17 percent from a peak reached in the spring of 2013, according to an analysis of sales data. Previous figures published by the city's Taxi and Limousine Commission -- showing flat prices -- appear to have been incorrect, and the commission removed them from its website after an inquiry from The New York Times.
In other big cities, medallion prices are also falling, often in conjunction with a sharp decline in sales volume. In Chicago, prices are down 17 percent. In Boston, they're down at least 20 percent, though it's hard to establish an exact market price because there have been only five trades since July. In Philadelphia, the taxi authority recently scrapped a planned medallion auction.
Most major American cities have long used a system to limit the number of operating taxicabs, typically a medallion system: Drivers must own or rent a medallion to operate a taxi, and the city issues a fixed number of them. In New York, which established its medallion system in 1937, that number is 13,437. The number has risen only gradually since the late 1990s, even as the city's economy has boomed.
The turmoil in the medallion market has been obscured in part because publicly disclosed data about taxi medallion prices can be misleading. And the turmoil suggests that the taxi business, which has undergone little change over many decades, is now in the midst of a revolution.
"I'm already at peace with the idea that I'm going to go bankrupt," said Larry Ionescu, who owns 98 Chicago taxi medallions. That might be overly dramatic; after all, Mr. Ionescu also compared Chicago's pro-Uber mayor, Rahm Emanuel, to Nicolae Ceausescu, the reviled ex-dictator of his native Romania. It's likely Mr. Ionescu remains a very rich man. In November, Chicago medallion sale prices averaged $298,000, well below the $357,000 price that was typical this spring, but far up from the $50,000 price of a decade ago.
But it's easy to see why he's worried about the medium term: A seven-mile ride from the Loop to the University of Chicago in a medallion taxi costs about $26, including tip. The same trip cost $12.29 this April with UberX, the lowest-cost service option from Uber.
The crucial question for medallion owners like Mr. Ionescu is, if Uber is that much cheaper than a taxi, why would anyone take a taxi, and therefore why would any driver pay to lease a medallion? Mr. Ionescu says his revenues are down around 25 percent, and he's having trouble leasing out his whole fleet.
Official data on medallion prices can be misleading for two main reasons: simple inaccuracy -- as in New York, where officials excluded most sales from their calculations -- or the very small number of sales. In Chicago, for example, there have been only 11 medallion sales since July 1, compared with 147 during the same period last year. Just because somebody sold a medallion for $300,000 doesn't mean it will be consistently possible to sell at that price into a thin market.
"Those are fake prices," said Mohammad Kamran, a medallion broker in Chicago, who blames UberX. "The price has plunged big time, and there are no buyers or sellers because the lenders are not lending money."
Mr. Kamran said owners are increasingly unable to charge Chicago's maximum weekly lease rate for medallion taxis, which is around $780, including taxes and insurance, for a late-model Toyota Prius. Drivers have been bargaining that rate down to $700 or $725, he says; others are defecting to services like Uber.
In Boston, the story is similar. As recently as April, Boston taxi medallions were selling for $700,000. The last sale, in October, was for $561,000.
"Right now Uber has a strong presence here in Boston, and that's having a dramatic impact on the taxi industry and the medallion values," said Donna Blythe-Shaw, a spokeswoman for the Boston Taxi Drivers' Association. "We hear that there's a couple of medallion owners that have offered to sell at 425 and nobody's touched them."
Not long ago, with demand for taxis rising and the supply fixed, medallions soared in value: A medallion that could be bought for $250,000 in New York a decade ago (or about $315,000 in inflation-adjusted dollars) was worth over $1 million last year.
Medallion sales volume has often fluctuated in New York, but right now it is at a low point. There was only one medallion sale in September, followed by nine in October. Ominously, five of the 10 sales in those two months were foreclosure sales. New York's taxi market had generally been thought less vulnerable because of the importance of street hails, which Uber can't do, and because New York requires Uber drivers to be licensed by the T.L.C. and drive vehicles with livery plates and commercial insurance.
Yellow taxis in New York also face competition from new green "boro taxis," which may pick up fares only in the boroughs outside Manhattan and in northern Manhattan. That program has been in the works for three years, including during a period when medallion prices were still rising. The vast majority of yellow cab pickups occur in Manhattan below 110th Street or at airports, where yellow cabs face competition from Uber but not from green cabs. Still, the green cab program has faced strong opposition from yellow cab medallion owners, and the start of falling medallion prices coincides with a June 2013 court ruling upholding the green cab program.
The trouble in New York's market was also partly obscured by a flaw in the average price reports that were published monthly by the city's taxi commission until September. Those reports erroneously said average prices for individual medallions had stayed largely the same since setting a record of $1.05 million in June 2013.
In fact, individual medallions have traded below $1 million for most of the last year. But the commission excludes from its statistics any transaction at a price more than $10,000 below the previous month's reported average.
The commission does so in the name of excluding sales that do not occur at an arm's length -- say, between two relatives. When prices are flat or rising, as they generally have been for decades, the methodology can produce a reasonably accurate result. But when prices are falling, the commission's method is guaranteed to mischaracterize the market.
A spokesman for the T.L.C. pointed to disclaimer language saying its average price reports "may be misleading and may not accurately convey trends in medallion prices, among other things."

Full text:   The stock market eked out another benchmark on Wednesday ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday as investors assessed the latest reports on the economy and some corporate earnings.
Orders for long-lasting manufactured goods rose in October, but a category that tracks business investment plans declined sharply for a second month. Another report showed consumers spent modestly more in October, a slight improvement after no gain in the previous month.
The reports paint a picture of a "good, but not great" economy, said Scott Keifer, global investment specialist at J. P. Morgan Private Bank. Slow growth is keeping inflation low, and that is holding down interest rates. The result is an environment in which stocks can prosper.
"There seems to be a feeling that the markets are going to continue to drift higher as we get to the end of the year," he said.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 5.80 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,072.83. The S.&P. 500 has now closed at a nominal record high 47 times this year.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 12.81 points, or 0.1 percent, to 17,827.75, also a nominal high. The Nasdaq composite index climbed 29.07 points, or 0.6 percent, to 4,787.32.
Semiconductor stocks were among the gainers on Wednesday after Analog Devices reported income and revenue that exceeded Wall Street's forecasts. The company said it expected revenue growth of 21 percent in the first fiscal quarter of 2015. The stock jumped $2.85, or 5.5 percent, to $54.56, leading gains for semiconductor stocks in the S.&P. 500, which rose 2.3 percent.
Stocks have rebounded strongly from a slump that lasted from mid-September to mid-October. The S.&P. 500 has surged 11.3 percent from the low point on Oct. 15. The gains have slowed this week, however.
"This seems to be a classic holiday plateau," said Kristina Hooper, head of United States capital markets research and strategy for Allianz Global Investors. "Probably, we are not going to get any focus until we come back on Monday."
The stock market in the United States will be closed on Thursday for Thanksgiving. It will also close early on Friday, at 1 p.m. Eastern time.
Among individual stocks, the manufacturing company Deere & Company was one of the bigger losers. The company's fourth-quarter results were stronger than Wall Street had expected, but the company said its sales of farm equipment and its income would keep falling in the new fiscal year. Deere's stock slid 80 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $86.99.
Energy stocks dropped the most out of the 10 industry groups represented in the S.&P. 500 index, slumping 1.1 percent and taking their loss for the year to 4.3 percent. The sector is the only group in the S.&P. 500 to be down for the year, as the price of oil has kept falling.
Oil hit another four-year low as members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries prepared to meet on Thursday in Vienna. That meeting is not expected to result in a cut to global production. Crude oil for January delivery fell 40 cents to settle at $73.69 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
In the bond market, interest rates slipped. The yield on the Treasury's 10-year note fell to 2.25 percent from 2.26 percent late Tuesday, while its price rose 4/32, to 100 2/32.

Full text:   Thanksgiving weekend has traditionally been the busiest time of the year for air travel, but that distinction is quickly becoming a thing of the past. With airlines merging and consolidating operations in fewer hubs, congestion that was once characteristic of the holiday is becoming more common at major airports all year round.
The change follows a string of megamergers that left four big carriers controlling about 80 percent of airlines' seat capacity, down from 11 in 2005. It might take another year to assess the impact of these mergers -- American Airlines and US Airways have not yet integrated their operations -- but fliers can already get a glimpse of the future of air travel.
"What was once the exception slowly becomes the rule," said Erik Hansen, the senior director of policy at the United States Travel Association, a trade group. It found that 13 of the nation's top 30 airports already experienced Thanksgiving-like congestion and traffic at least one day a week. "People will see our airports bursting at the seams."
And while the number of passengers keeps growing every year, airlines are not increasing seat supplies much, which means planes are growing more crowded. Fares, as a result, have risen in the last five years after being driven down by weaker demand during the recession and fare wars in previous years.
Heidi Golledge, the founder and chief executive of CareerBliss.com, a job search website, said she had noticed the change.
"A few years ago, you could still get last-minute tickets," she said. "Definitely, across the board it's been more expensive and harder to get. I would say like 95 percent of the flights I'm on are just full to the rafters, which was never the case before."
JetBlue Airways, which had long stood out from the competition by offering passengers more legroom and free checked bags, was the latest carrier to yield to Wall Street demands and give passengers less legroom. The airline announced last week that it would add 15 more seats to its planes. It also said it would introduce checked bag fees. (Southwest still offers free checked bags.)
The fare increases have been most noticeable on the most desirable flights -- nonstop flights in the mornings, for instance -- and fewer cheaper seats are available on each flight.
Average airfares rose to $396 in the second quarter of the year, up 2.5 percent from the same period last year, according to the latest government statistics. But those prices can mask wide disparities depending on the time of the flight or the day of the week. Also, they do not include extra fees that airlines have imposed on passengers, and that can add up fast.
"You never seem to fly those good deals anymore," said Adam Zeitsiff, president of Jonas Fitness, a software company on Long Island, who travels most weeks. He said that he regularly paid $900 to $1,000 to fly to Columbus, Ohio.
"The routes where they know they can get you they sure do," he added. "I go to Houston all the time, and it's still $600 or $700. Those $300 to $400 fare days are pretty much over."
If there has been any beneficiary recently, it's the airlines, which are enjoying a rare period of financial stability.
Delta Air Lines registered a 12 percent increase in its domestic passenger revenues in the last quarter compared with the same time last year. American Airlines, which emerged from bankruptcy, is making money for the first time in a long time. Even United Airlines, which stumbled repeatedly after merging with Continental, posted its highest-ever profit in the third quarter.
"It's like the five families in the 'Godfather' movies," said Mike Boyd, an industry consultant. "You now have four network airlines, they each have their turfs, and they are not out to kill each other. They might squabble sometimes, and they might give up some of their turf. But its now a stable industry focused on making money."
Kevin Mitchell, the chairman of the Business Travel Coalition, a trade group, said the risk was that airlines would start moving in lock step.
"The No. 1 concern is passive coordination of policies, fees and practices," Mr. Mitchell said. "And that's what we are seeing."
Airlines have also made it harder for passengers to compare fares and fees as they withdraw from popular search engines. Now, they seek to draw travelers to their own websites, reducing consumers' ability to compare and shop.
Airlines, for their part, maintain that competition remains strong, and that airfares have actually fallen.
"Customers have options among airlines and even options within airlines for what they value and are willing to pay for," said Jean Medina, a spokeswoman for Airlines for America, the industry's trade group. "Airfare remains a bargain. Adjusted for inflation, airfare actually fell when comparing 2013 to 2000."
Brett Snyder, president of Cranky Concierge, an air travel assistance website, also saw benefits for consumers. "You are seeing better reliability, you are seeing more attention to the experience itself, and in general I think there is a better product out there," he said.
Those include investments made by many airlines including American, Delta and JetBlue to upgrade seats on transcontinental flights, or to improve airport amenities and business lounges.
And airlines say that they are creating bigger networks linking more cities both in the United States and abroad. For instance, American Airlines passengers can use the combined network of American and US Airways, which serves more destinations than any airline could on its own.
And there is still room for competition, the airlines say. Lower-fare carriers like Spirit, Virgin America, JetBlue and Frontier can act as a check to keep fares from rising too much. For example, when Delta sought to expand its presence in Seattle, an Alaska Airlines hub, fares there fell. The New York area, with three major airports, remains a battleground for the three international carriers Delta, American and United.
Consumer advocates point out that not every passenger is equally served by these bigger networks. Charlie Leocha, from Travelers United, a consumer rights organization, said that airlines had focused operations on fewer big hubs, like Kennedy Airport in New York, O'Hare in Chicago or the Dallas/Fort Worth Airport, providing residents there the benefit of a much bigger network. For people in midsize cities that have lost their hubs because of the mergers, though, the impact has been a big downgrade in choices. Those include cities like Cincinnati, Cleveland, Memphis, Milwaukee, Nashville, Pittsburgh, Raleigh, N.C., or St. Louis, Mr. Leocha said.
"In those cities, you've seen your options cut," he said. "Everybody is experimenting with passengers. I call it a petri dish in the sky."

Full text:   The nation's economic output grew at an even faster rate during July, August and September than the government initially estimated, giving the economy its strongest six-month performance in more than a decade.
The intense focus on the coming shopping frenzy as the holiday period begins this week almost made interest in the economy's third-quarter performance seem like an exercise in nostalgia. But the Commerce Department's release on Tuesday of its revised estimate of gross domestic product -- the broadest measure of goods and services produced across the nation -- showed that consumers had already stepped up their pace of purchasing.
The shift in the annual rate of growth to 3.9 percent from 3.5 percent was mainly because of a bigger-than-expected jump in consumer spending, bolstered by a modest increase in reported business investment.
"The upward revision was almost exclusively due to much stronger buying by consumers," said Carl R. Tannenbaum, chief economist at the Northern Trust Company. "I find that very encouraging coming into the commercial side of the holiday seasons."
While the economic recovery, now into its sixth year, has been lackluster, Mr. Tannenbaum noted that in four of the last five quarters, "growth has moved to a much stronger level." This 3.9 percent growth rate comes on the heels of a 4.6 percent jump in G.D.P. during the second quarter, after a freezing winter that helped cause the nation's output to drop at a rate of 2.1 percent in the first three months of the year.
Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, agreed that "the trend has shifted higher," although he said he doubted that G.D.P. growth could be sustained at the third quarter's nearly 4 percent pace.
Falling gasoline prices, which left Americans with more cash for other purchases, partly explain why people could spend more, economists agree.
The G.D.P. figures made the drop in the Conference Board's latest measure of consumer confidence to 88.7 in November from 94.1 in October all the more of an anomaly. Other surveys, including the Rasmussen index, have shown confidence surging.
Consumer spending is a closely watched figure because it accounts for 70 percent of economic activity and must advance at a steady rate to power the economy forward.
But it is business investment, including the rise and fall of inventory accumulation, that most influences economic turning points. Nonresidential investments grew by 7.1 percent, while investment in equipment reached 10.7 percent.
"The thing I was most encouraged by was the pickup in business investment spending," said Jerry Webman, chief economist at Oppenheimer Funds, "That says business confidence is building, and that we should expect to see hiring continue."
Government spending, which grew at a 4.2 percent pace, turned out not to be quite as substantial as the Commerce Department initially estimated.
The economy's growth has steadily reduced the unemployment rate. Last month, the official rate hit 5.8 percent, a drop of 1.4 percentage points from a year earlier. Employers have added more than 200,000 jobs for nine months in a row, according to Labor Department figures.
And signs are growing that the quality of jobs is improving. A report released on Monday by Julie Hotchkiss, a research economist and senior policy adviser at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, disputed claims that many of the newly created jobs were part-time positions.
"Of the additional 8.2 million people employed since October 2010, 7.8 million (95 percent) are employed full time," she wrote.
But the job market is still far from fully employing millions of Americans who want to work, one of the main reasons wages have stagnated, barely keeping up with the persistently low rate of inflation.
In addition, the housing sector is well below historical standards. Residential housing investment was up 2.7 percent, according to the revised G.D.P. figures.
At the same time, the Case-Shiller Home Price Index of 20 major cities, released on Tuesday by Standard & Poor's, rose at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.8 percent in September, a sharp slowdown from the double-digit pace prices were rising earlier this year.
"The overall trend in home price increases continues to slow down," David M. Blitzer, chairman of the index committee at S&P Dow Jones Indices, said in a statement. "The Northeast region reported its first negative monthly returns since December 2013."
"The only region showing any sustained strength is the Southeast led by Florida; price gains are also evident in Atlanta and Charlotte," he added.
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York, in a study on household debt and credit, also found that new and refinanced mortgage loans hit their lowest level since 2000, largely because of a bump in interest rates last year.
Still, the American economy is one of the few bright spots in the global economy. In recent weeks, Japan's central bank and Europe's have moved to nudge their sagging economies forward by lowering interest rates. In the United States, the latest G.D.P. figures have given economists one more reason to believe that the Federal Reserve will start moving in the opposite direction next year.
As Mr. Tannenbaum said, Tuesday's report -- the second of three increasingly refined measures the government issues on quarterly economic activity -- may "bring forward the day where the Fed can think about normalizing interest rates."

Abstract: High Level Hostel, one of the newest tenants in the financial district here known as Moscow City, sits on prime real estate on the 43rd floor of a multimillion-dollar glass-and-steel tower. The government also accounts for an outsize proportion of the economy, leaving scant jobs for the grunt workers of private enterprise, the bankers, lawyers and traders for whom Moscow City was built.

Full text:   MOSCOW -- In the coveted corner office, a bearded man in sweatpants scrambled eggs at a kitchenette, all the while taking in the serene beauty of the city lights twinkling far below.
In the conference room, or as the company prefers to call it, the "common area," two other men lounged about playing video games on an Xbox. In place of cubicles, there are bunk beds.
High Level Hostel, one of the newest tenants in the financial district here known as Moscow City, sits on prime real estate on the 43rd floor of a multimillion-dollar glass-and-steel tower. It is not a youth-hostel-themed work space, but an actual youth hostel -- dirty socks and all.
"We thought, 'why not open a hostel in a skyscraper?' " said Roman Drozdenko, the 25-year-old owner. "Nobody's done that before."
The tower, with its marble veneer foyer, banks of elevators and breathtaking views, was clearly built for lawyers, accountants or stock traders. But "there were no questions regarding our guests" from the building management when he opened in September, Mr. Drozdenko said. "In fact, there were no questions at all."
Moscow's skyscraper district, formally the Moscow International Business Center, reflects the broader problems in the Russian economy. The country, facing broad-ranging financial sanctions and largely dominated by state-run companies, simply has no need for vast office spaces for stock traders, auditors and bankers.
Vacancy rates in the newly built financial district have become acute. The entire site, some 148 acres that now includes the tallest building in Europe, Mercury City Tower, had a vacancy rate of 32 percent at the end of October, according to Cushman & Wakefield, the real estate consultancy. The rate is projected to rise above 50 percent next year when new buildings open.
"Russians have a great tradition of building things they don't need," Sergei Petrov, an office worker in Naberezhnaya tower, said of the emptiness behind the glass facades, a veritable Potemkin Wall Street.
Moscow City was envisioned as a hub of emerging market finance, a shiny skyscraper-dotted testament to Russia's growing international influence. For a time, the idea was not improbable: From 2000 to 2007, the Russian economy grew on average 7 percent a year.
This herculean undertaking on a bank of the Moskva River was to be Moscow's answer to Manhattan or the City of London.
One tower, called Evolution, twists in a DNA-evoking double helix. The spires of Federation Towers resemble billowing sails, evoking Russia sailing into a capitalist future. Federation Tower East, when finished, will rise 95 stories to a height of 1,224 feet, surpassing its still mostly empty neighbor Mercury City Tower as the tallest building in Europe.
Eight skyscrapers are finished, including the gold-tinted Mercury tower. Eight others are under construction, and two more are planned. The entire site is scheduled to be finished by 2018.
But Russia's tanks are now getting more international attention than its banks, leaving Moscow City as a $12 billion reminder of the nation's economic woes.
Western sanctions, for example, have taken aim at Russia's largest state financial institutions, Sberbank and VTB, which both own towers or floor space in Moscow City. The two banks now have a limited ability to issue debt on global markets, thus limiting their growth options.
Sanctions by the United States and the European Union are expected to trim about 1 percentage point of growth from Russia's gross domestic product this year, and slightly more next year if they remain in place. Even without sanctions, problems have been stacking up. Rising inflation, falling oil prices, and a tumbling ruble have left Russia near recession.
The government also accounts for an outsize proportion of the economy, leaving scant jobs for the grunt workers of private enterprise, the bankers, lawyers and traders for whom Moscow City was built. In Russia, 81 percent of the shares of the top 10 companies are owned by the same entity, the state, compared with 11 in Germany, according to a study by Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development economists.
Rather than turning to banks, Russia's largest company, the sanctioned state oil company Rosneft is now appealing directly to state funds for loans. And the Kremlin this year again delayed shifting pensions into the private sector, dealing another blow to financial sector jobs.
"Somebody had the idea that if you build a lot of skyscrapers in one spot you have an international financial center," Darrell Stanaford, a real estate analyst in Moscow with Romanov Dvor, said in an interview. "But it doesn't work. You need other things, too."
Moscow City, which has taken a direct hit from these policies, is now shifting tactics to fill the glut of premier office space.
City, the management company for the development in the neighborhood, says financial services companies are no longer the majority of its new tenants. Of the new Russian occupants signing leases this year, 58 percent were nonfinancial companies as well as local small and midsize businesses, like High Level Hostel, according to the management company.
New buildings are also being repurposed at the development stage. One low-rise will become a 6,000-seat movie theater.
In finished towers, various nonfinancial ventures are renting space. One company sells Cambodian citizenship to Russians wanting a second passport. A culinary school and restaurant are opening.
Many multinationals have rented space. IBM, General Electric, KPMG, General Motors, Hyundai, Energizer and Japan Tobacco International are all tenants, as is a major Russian investment bank, Renaissance Capital.
Prices, too, are falling. Mr. Drozdenko, the hostel owner, said a real estate agent offered him the space for about $8,000 a month for 1,600 square feet, or about $5 a square foot.
In Moscow City, office space currently averages $6.90 a square foot each month. That's below the average of $7.75 for high-grade office space elsewhere in the capital, according to Denis T. Sokolov, senior analyst and a partner at Cushman & Wakefield in Moscow.
"We have to do this," Dmitry Granov, the director of City management, said in an interview of the effort to broaden the range of tenants, because of the dearth of financial sector jobs in Russia.
"If before we were looking for international corporations, today we are looking for Russian companies, and small and medium businesses," he said. He said dropping rents would attract technology start-ups.
City management company contested the vacancy estimate by Cushman & Wakefield. Cushman & Wakefield counts vacant sublease space in its total, while the management company does not. City says current vacancies are about 20 percent.
Meshing the various constituencies is also creating challenges.
"The cafes, amenities and dress code you need is different for clients of a youth hostel and for investment bankers," said Mr. Stanaford, the real estate analyst, of settling tenants like High Level Hostel in their high-level location. "What image-conscious business is going to buy office space in the same skyscraper with a youth hostel?"
Empire Tower, the skyscraper where High Level hostel sits, is still largely empty two years after opening. In the foyer, an oval marble sculpture echoes the oval motif of the 60-story tower, designed for a more professional clientele.
Forty-three stories up, High Level Hostel opened in September with 24 beds, with prices starting at $25.50 in a six-person room, including a breakfast of toast, porridge or muesli. The hostel manager, Leonid L. Fedotov, 19, who goes by the nickname the Beard, recalled backpacking guests from Holland named Ron and Eve.
"It was really cool because Ron and I played guitar in the evening," he said, as they gazed out at the twirling facade of Evolution Tower and the sea of lights of Moscow below.

Full text:   TEHRAN -- A year ago Iranians danced in the streets after they elected President Hassan Rouhani, mainly because he promised to get devastating sanctions lifted by starting negotiations over Iran's nuclear program.
On Monday, hours after a deadline for those talks set 12 months ago had been extended by 7 months without any clear result, Iranian state television played a prerecorded interview with the president, but Mehdi Mohammadi, a philosophy student who voted for Mr. Rouhani, did not bother to watch. He "could already guess," he said, what the president would say.
"The negotiations are the only way, everything has gotten better and the country will become even more glorious in the future. But I no longer believe him," said Mr. Mohammadi, who is thinking of leaving Iran. In the background, Mr. Rouhani promised victory in the nuclear talks and a bright future for the Iranian nation.
As Mr. Mohammadi's reaction underscored, the enthusiasm for such promises is growing thinner and thinner, many of his supporters and analysts say, especially since Mr. Rouhani has in the eyes of many failed to deliver on other promises of more freedoms and improving the economy. He has instead doubled down on making a nuclear deal, which puts him in a politically dangerous position.
"The people will have to endure yet another seven months of indecision and hesitation, there will be continued economic pressure on their shoulders," said Mojgan Faraji, a journalist who in the past has supported Mr. Rouhani. "It is a failure for the government that they have not been able to finalize the deal."
While many of his supporters continue to hope for a deal, they increasingly suspect that whatever such an agreement might be, it may not lead to the huge changes they are hoping for. Many of them have grown passive, some cynical.
Those who stood by Mr. Rouhani during his campaign now say that the president has been making too many promises and that it is hurting his credibility.
"He has made too many promises in economic and social affairs, but he has failed to honor them. His insistence that the sanctions would be lifted now only prove to be another failure," said Farshad Ghorbanpour, a political analyst who had long supported the government. "I don't understand why he continuously raises expectations."
From the beginning, a positive future for Iran has been one of the main messages of the Rouhani government
And his government has scored some successes, particularly with the economy, at least compared with his predecessor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Inflation has dropped to 25 percent from 42 percent a year ago while the currency has been stable after a long period of decline.
"Critics should realize that we now manage the country with prudence and wisdom," said Saeed Laylaz, an economist close to the government. "We are ready and hopeful for the future, but everything needs time."
Mr. Rouhani's political opponents, a coterie of hard-line clerics and Revolutionary Guards commanders, accuse Mr. Rouhani of planning to "sell out" the country, part of a growing new narrative against him, analysts say.
To many, it is clear that the coming seven months, until the new nuclear deadline set for June 30, will determine Mr. Rouhani's political fate. "At best he will lose the next elections if there is no good deal," Mr. Ghorbanpour said. "But it could be much worse."

Lawmakers Look for Ways to Provide Relief for High Cost of Drugs

Abstract: Because the United States does not regulate drug pricing or negotiate prices nationally like other countries, generic medicines have long been a safety valve for American patients, allowing them to obtain needed medicines at lower costs.

Full text:   With the prices for some common generic medicines soaring over the past 18 months, state and federal lawmakers are trying to find relief for patients struggling to pay.
On Thursday, a Senate panel convened to investigate price increases for generic drugs. Separately, Senators Amy Klobuchar and John McCain will revive stalled legislation to allow some prescription imports from Canada. And Maine is testing out a hotly contested new law that allows its residents to buy drugs from overseas, flouting United States policy.
One half of generic medicines went up in price between last summer and this summer; about 10 percent more than doubled in cost in that time, with some common medicines rising by over 500 percent, new data released in connection with a Congressional hearing found. These include thyroid replacement hormone, the antibiotic doxycycline, the heart pill digoxin and the asthma pill albuterol.
"Generics have played an important role in making medicine affordable for millions of people," said Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont and chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Primary Health and Aging, who held this week's hearing with Representative Elijah E. Cummings, Democrat of Maryland. "I worry that we're seeing the end of that now," Mr. Sanders said in a telephone interview. "This should be highlighted and remedied."
Because the United States does not regulate drug pricing or negotiate prices nationally like other countries, generic medicines have long been a safety valve for American patients, allowing them to obtain needed medicines at lower costs. Brand name medicines are granted patent protection for a number of years after they enter the market. Historically, after the patent expires, generic copies have entered the fray, bringing prices down, often sharply.
But that pattern is changing, researchers and policy makers say.
The cost of many generic medications has increased so much over the past year that prices for many common generic drugs in the United States have surpassed those of their brand-name equivalents in other developed countries, a new analysis by the website Pharmacychecker, which guides patients in the mail order purchase of medications, has found.
For example, a 90-day supply of the generic heart medicine digoxin sells for $187 in New York; the branded version, Lanoxin, sells for $24.30 in Canada. A month's supply of a generic steroid to treat inflammatory bowel disease sells for $1,625 in the United States, while the branded version sells for $155.70 in Canada. A three-month supply of the generic cholesterol lowering drug pravastatin costs $230 in this country, but $31.50 for the branded drug Pravachol in Canada.
Senator Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat, said the time was right for legislation as drug costs have risen, while salaries have not. "The economy has stabilized but it's really hard for the middle class to get by, and this is a glaring example of where we are so out of line with other countries," she said in a phone interview. "One solution is to let some competition in from over the border."
There are many reasons that generic prices may fluctuate. The price of a key ingredient may increase markedly, or competition may decrease as manufacturers leave a market, leading to price rises.
Stephen W. Schondelmeyer, a pharmaceutical economist at the University of Minnesota, spoke of the current "Wild, Wild West of drug pricing," adding, "I believe in markets, but this market is broken; it's failing."
He noted that for generics, "the trend is going up rather than down, as we'd expect, and not just 2 or 5 percent but by hundreds or even thousands of percent." Brand-name medicines have increased in price as well, by an average of 12.9 percent in 2013, he said.
Ralph G. Neas, president of the Generic Pharmaceutical Association, said that the congressional committee had overstated the rise in generic drug prices in its calculations. He said that over all, generic drugs had saved Americans $1.46 trillion in the past decade, and $239 billion in 2013, compared with the price of brand drugs.
The idea of allowing Americans to import drugs from Canada or other developed countries is strongly opposed by the powerful United States pharmaceutical industry. Importation even for personal use is generally illegal under Food and Drug Administration regulations. Such medicines may be impounded at the border, although the law is rarely enforced.
With the federal government slow to come to the table on the issue, some states have been taking matters into their own hands. Last fall, a new law in Maine began allowing residents to mail order prescription medicines from licensed pharmacies in Canada, Britain, Australia and New Zealand.
Mainers had long been traveling over the border to get cheaper medicines, said Troy D. Jackson, a state senator who sponsored the bill. "They were organizing bus trips because the price difference was so extreme." The city of Portland and some state employees were able to use their insurance to order Canadian medicine.
"We'd used it for eight years without a problem," Mr. Jackson said. "It was convenient, and there wasn't one safety issue." But the practice was deemed illegal in 2012, prompting the new law, which essentially licenses select pharmacies in other English-speaking countries to operate in Maine.
A little over a year later, companies have been set up in Canada and Britain specifically to sell prescription medicines to Mainers.
While other states have considered such legislation, they are watching how legal challenges play out in court. State pharmacists have challenged the law, saying it exposes them to unfair competition. (The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America has been vocal in opposing the law on the grounds that it contradicts F.D.A. policy and exposes patients to dangerous drugs.)
At the hearing this week, Senator Sanders and Representative Cummings announced that they would immediately propose legislation mandating that generic drug makers extend rebates to Medicare and Medicaid if their prices rise faster than the rate of inflation -- a policy already in place for branded drugs. Other ideas included allowing the F.D.A. to fast-track applications to maintain more competition in the generic market.
At the hearing, the two had hoped generic drug makers would aid their investigation by explaining the reason behind the price rises. But all three executives invited to testify declined. That included Arthur P. Bedrosian, the chief executive of Lannett, which has raised the price of generic digoxin by nearly 1,000 percent, a sudden price rise examined recently by The New York Times.
Since then, the company has been subpoenaed by the Connecticut attorney general and by the Department of Justice seeking information about its interactions with competitors in setting prices. The company contends it acted legally, though Mr. Bedrosian has boasted at shareholder meeting that his company has record profits thanks to its opportunistic pricing.
He told the congressional committee that he could not come to the hearing because he would be at an investors meeting in Europe.

Full text:   Six years ago the Federal Reserve hit rock bottom. It had been cutting the federal funds rate, the interest rate it uses to steer the economy, more or less frantically in an unsuccessful attempt to get ahead of the recession and financial crisis. But it eventually reached the point where it could cut no more, because interest rates can't go below zero. On Dec. 16, 2008, the Fed set its interest target between 0 and 0.25 percent, where it remains to this day.
The fact that we've spent six years at the so-called zero lower bound is amazing and depressing. What's even more amazing and depressing, if you ask me, is how slow our economic discourse has been to catch up with the new reality. Everything changes when the economy is at rock bottom -- or, to use the term of art, in a liquidity trap (don't ask). But for the longest time, nobody with the power to shape policy would believe it.
What do I mean by saying that everything changes? As I wrote way back when, in a rock-bottom economy "the usual rules of economic policy no longer apply: virtue becomes vice, caution is risky and prudence is folly." Government spending doesn't compete with private investment -- it actually promotes business spending. Central bankers, who normally cultivate an image as stern inflation-fighters, need to do the exact opposite, convincing markets and investors that they will push inflation up. "Structural reform," which usually means making it easier to cut wages, is more likely to destroy jobs than create them.
This may all sound wild and radical, but it isn't. In fact, it's what mainstream economic analysis says will happen once interest rates hit zero. And it's also what history tells us. If you paid attention to the lessons of post-bubble Japan, or for that matter the U.S. economy in the 1930s, you were more or less ready for the looking-glass world of economic policy we've lived in since 2008.
But as I said, nobody would believe it. By and large, policy makers and Very Serious People in general went with gut feelings rather than careful economic analysis. Yes, they sometimes found credentialed economists to back their positions, but they used these economists the way a drunkard uses a lamppost: for support, not for illumination. And what the guts of these serious people have told them, year after year, is to fear -- and do -- exactly the wrong things.
Thus we were told again and again that budget deficits were our most pressing economic problem, that interest rates would soar any day now unless we imposed harsh fiscal austerity. I could have told you that this was foolish, and in fact I did, and sure enough, the predicted interest rate spike never happened -- but demands that we cut government spending now, now, now have cost millions of jobs and deeply damaged our infrastructure.
We were also told repeatedly that printing money -- not what the Fed was actually doing, but never mind -- would lead to "currency debasement and inflation." The Fed, to its credit, stood up to this pressure, but other central banks didn't. The European Central Bank, in particular, raised rates in 2011 to head off a nonexistent inflationary threat. It eventually reversed course but has never gotten things back on track. At this point European inflation is far below the official target of 2 percent, and the Continent is flirting with outright deflation.
But are these bad calls just water under the bridge? Isn't the era of rock-bottom economics just about over? Don't count on it.
It's true that with the U.S. unemployment rate dropping, most analysts expect the Fed to raise interest rates sometime next year. But inflation is low, wages are weak, and the Fed seems to realize that raising rates too soon would be disastrous. Meanwhile, Europe looks further than ever from economic liftoff, while Japan is still struggling to escape from deflation. Oh, and China, which is starting to remind some of us of Japan in the late 1980s, could join the rock-bottom club sooner than you think.
So the counterintuitive realities of economic policy at the zero lower bound are likely to remain relevant for a long time to come, which makes it crucial that influential people understand those realities. Unfortunately, too many still don't; one of the most striking aspects of economic debate in recent years has been the extent to which those whose economic doctrines have failed the reality test refuse to admit error, let alone learn from it. The intellectual leaders of the new majority in Congress still insist that we're living in an Ayn Rand novel; German officials still insist that the problem is that debtors haven't suffered enough.
This bodes ill for the future. What people in power don't know, or worse what they think they know but isn't so, can very definitely hurt us.

Full text:   PARIS -- Mario Draghi, the European Central Bank president, strongly signaled on Friday that he and his colleagues were preparing a new round of powerful monetary stimulus to jolt the flagging eurozone economy.
The remarks buoyed European stocks and bonds even before the Chinese central bank moved markets further on Friday by surprising investors with its first interest rate cut in two years.
While slowing growth was the reason for Beijing's move, in Europe the big concern is a worrisomely low inflation rate that is both a symptom and cause of the 18-nation euro currency union's inability to achieve any sustainable growth at all.
Speaking at a banking conference in Frankfurt, Mr. Draghi said the European Central Bank would "do what we must to raise inflation and inflation expectations as fast as possible."
If the bank's current policies, which include some purchases of corporate bonds, do not end the threat, Mr. Draghi said, "we would step up the pressure and broaden even more the channels through which we intervene, by altering accordingly the size, pace and composition of our purchases."
The blunt call was reminiscent of a speech Mr. Draghi gave in July 2012, when he said the central bank "is ready to do whatever it takes to preserve the euro," an assertion that has been widely credited with having helped to ease the sovereign debt crisis.
At issue is whether the European Central Bank will follow its peers around the world, including the Federal Reserve in the United States, the Bank of Japan and the Bank of England, in buying government bonds on a large scale, a policy known as quantitative easing.
With interest rates around most of the developed world having been effectively cut to as low as they can go, conventional monetary policy has reached its "zero lower bound." While there is no consensus on the effectiveness of quantitative easing, many economists point to the relatively strong British and American recoveries as evidence that it works.
While Mr. Draghi on Friday did not actually say much that was different from previous utterances, there was a significant new emphasis on the risk of deflation in the eurozone. He warned that the "inflation situation in the euro area has also become increasingly challenging." The word "inflation" appeared 45 times in the text of his speech on Friday.
The risk Mr. Draghi now runs is that unless the central bank's actions keep pace with his words, he can lose credibility. Many economists have been pushing for most of this year for the central bank to take more aggressive stimulus steps, while Mr. Draghi in his monthly news conferences has been saying the equivalent of "stay tuned."
If, after Friday's statements, Mr. Draghi is unable to announce significant new measures when he and his governing council meet in early December, the financial markets could register their disappointment. Some analysts immediately predicted, though, that Mr. Draghi was simply trying to buy more time.
Mr. Draghi will find himself even more on the spot at the December meeting if a closely watched report on eurozone inflation next week shows prices falling further.
Mr. Draghi spoke Friday as the world's central banks are increasingly concerned that very low inflation will tip into outright deflation -- a self-reinforcing condition in which consumers and businesses put off purchases and investments in the expectation that prices will fall. Deflation can also crush fragile borrowers by raising the real interest rate on their loans, which would load weak banks with a new round of defaults on loans.
Eurozone consumer prices rose just 0.4 percent in October, far below the central bank's target of close to but less than 2 percent. In fact, some member states have already begun to experience deflation. Mr. Draghi and his peers are afraid that consumers and investors will increasingly see low inflation as the new normal, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy.
The European Central Bank in September cut its main interest rate target to a rock-bottom 0.05 percent, and reduced its deposit rate to minus 0.2 percent, effectively charging banks for leaving unused funds at the central bank. The bank has been buying private-sector loan assets since early October. And it has announced longer-term low-interest loans to banks in an effort to restart lending.
So far, that has not been enough. Recently, Mr. Draghi has said the central bank intends to expand the size of its balance sheet -- that is, to inject money into the market -- by 1 trillion euros, or about $1.25 trillion. Economists say the current measures fall far short of what is needed to hit that level.
Michel Martinez, chief eurozone economist with Société Générale, noted that Mr. Draghi had not provided much detail about his inflation-fighting plans. Mr. Martinez said he expected the central bank to increase its purchases of private-sector assets, including packages of housing loans known as covered bonds, as well as of debt issued by agencies like the European Investment Bank.
"But when you do the math, you make a rough assumption that the E.C.B. takes 20 percent of all those available assets," Mr. Martinez said. "That's barely [EUR]400 billion."
If Mr. Draghi is going to hit his target, Mr. Martinez added, "obviously the answer is to purchase government bonds."
Expectations that the central bank will increase the supply of euros in the market led investors to sell the European currency in favor of dollars, particularly as the Federal Reserve has begun reining in its own bond-buying. The euro fell about 1 percent to $1.2438 in afternoon trading. The Euro Stoxx 50 index gained 2.97 percent. Yields on Spanish and Italian 10-year bonds fell roughly 1 percent.
Mr. Draghi also acknowledged that weak growth had contributed to the risk of deflation. The economy of the 18-nation euro currency bloc largely has largely stagnated since April, and a private-sector survey of purchasing managers on Thursday showed more signs of deceleration. The poor labor market has kept consumer demand suppressed.
And yet, the path to employing wholesale bond-buying is not an easy one. There is significant opposition to such a policy in Germany, for example, and even if the political hurdles are overcome, economists say they wonder whether the eurozone -- in which each country, rather than the bloc as a whole, issues bonds -- is the appropriate venue for quantitative easing.
Two of Germany's gatekeepers on the question of quantitative easing -- the government's finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, and the German central bank's president, Jens Weidmann -- addressed the same conference on Friday but declined to comment on Mr. Draghi's speech.
In any case, Mr. Martinez said he was not convinced that Mr. Draghi was ready to act in the near term, perhaps not before next summer.
"The E.C.B. is buying time in the hope that the outlook improves," he said.
Guntram B. Wolff, who follows the European economy as director of the Brussels-based research institute Bruegel, agreed.
"My take is that it will still take some time before" Mr. Draghi commits to buying government bonds, Mr. Wolff said. "My sense is that the German government is moving toward the position that this may have to happen at some point to prevent a catastrophe in terms of prolonged low inflation or even deflation. It has serious implications for Germany, too."

Abstract: With the Fed stepping back in the United States, the collective action elsewhere "supports the growth outlook for next year," said William Adams, senior international economist with the PNC financial services group. Most immediately, the rate cuts will make financing easier for the country's large state-owned companies, which tend to enjoy easier access to loans from the government-controlled banking sector.

Full text:   HONG KONG -- China finally admitted it has a growth problem -- and that is a big step to getting the global economy back on track.
For months, Beijing avoided broad stimulus measures, signaling that it was comfortable with the country's slowing growth. But China's pockets of weakness, coupled with the continuing woes in Japan and Europe, prompted anxiety in the financial markets.
Now China is changing its stimulus stance, announcing a surprise interest rate cut on Friday. The action will lift the country's flagging housing market and large state-owned companies, as well as bolster other nations that have come to rely on those core parts of China's economy.
In cutting rates, China joins the parade of global policy makers who are stepping up their stimulus efforts to support growth. They are filling a void left by the United States Federal Reserve, which just ended a six-year bond-buying campaign that has kept borrowing costs low and has encouraged spending worldwide.
As Europe's economy stagnates and inflation remains dangerously low, the region's central bank is considering a similar plan to purchase government bonds on a large scale, a policy known as quantitative easing. The European Central Bank president, Mario Draghi, said on Friday that he and his colleagues would "do what we must" to address the economic issues, a sentiment that helped spark a 3 percent jump in the region's stocks.
Japan's central bank abruptly decided to ramp up its bond-buying campaign last month as the government's revival plan faltered. The plan has taken on more urgency this week, as Japan's economy plunged into a recession in the third quarter.
With the Fed stepping back in the United States, the collective action elsewhere "supports the growth outlook for next year," said William Adams, senior international economist with the PNC financial services group. "Global liquidity remains abundant and will continue to be so in 2015."
The rate cuts by China helped soothe the global markets, which had become increasingly volatile with the drumbeat of bad economic data coming out of China and other parts of the world. American stocks rose modestly on Friday.
"The Chinese economy has been an engine of growth for the global economy for quite some time, so any measures to head off a softening of growth in China is a plus," said Paul Edelstein, director of financial economics at IHS Global Insight, a research firm. China's move "gives confidence to investors."
Even as China's economy showed signs of weakness, policy makers refrained from broad measures like rate cuts to support growth. Instead, they made more targeted efforts, including making new credit lines available to certain banks and financial institutions. They also focused on specific goals like supporting the agriculture industry and constructing subsidized housing.
But those unconventional measures appear to have had limited effect. Borrowing costs remain high, and growth in new lending remains lackluster.
Other signs of strain have also mounted. Home prices continue to slide, declining in October from a year earlier in 67 of the 70 biggest cities, data released this week showed. Foreign investment, a boon to the economy for years, is contracting. And China's huge manufacturing sector, a major employer and a driver of exports, is struggling with rampant overcapacity in many industries, leading to falling prices.
So far this year, China has come up short in its growth goals. Gross domestic product in the third quarter increased 7.3 percent. While such growth would be the envy of many countries, it looked weak by Chinese standards. It was slowest pace since the depths of the financial crisis in 2009. Many economists now expect the country to fall short of the government's official growth target of 7.5 percent for the year.
The rate cut, the first since the summer of 2012, reflects a discomfort among the country's leaders with the speed of China's economic deceleration.
The central bank, the People's Bank of China, cut its benchmark one-year deposit rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 2.75 percent, and reduced the one-year lending rate by 0.4 percentage points, to 5.6 percent. Policy makers also said they would give China's banks more leeway in determining interest on deposits, allowing them to pay as much as 120 percent of the benchmark rate, up from 110 percent previously.
Most immediately, the rate cuts will make financing easier for the country's large state-owned companies, which tend to enjoy easier access to loans from the government-controlled banking sector. That will help ease China's debt pressure, as companies find it cheaper to pay off or refinance loans that are coming due.
"The impact on G.D.P. growth will be small," Mark Williams, the chief Asia economist at Capital Economics, wrote Friday in a research note. "The main effect will be to improve the financial position of large firms."
But the move is not without risks. While cheap credit helped fuel an aggressive expansion after the global financial crisis, it also led to ballooning levels of corporate and local government debt. The rate cuts -- and any new lending they spur -- may raise further alarms that the debt levels are unsustainable. A wave of bad loans could set the stage for a severe economic downturn or another financial shock.
Despite the surprise move, Chinese policy makers tempered expectations for more aggressive stimulus. The central bank on Friday emphasized that monetary policy would not change direction in a fundamental way.
"Over all, the country retains a mid to high rate of macroeconomic growth, price inflation has slowed, the economic structure is continuously being optimized and upgraded and growth is shifting from being investment-driven to being driven by innovation," the central bank said in a statement. "Thus, there is no need to undertake strong stimulus measures, and the prudent monetary policy direction will not change."
Some economists and analysts took a different view, indicating that the rate cuts raised the likelihood of more stimulus measures. Li-Gang Liu, chief economist for greater China at the Australia and New Zealand Banking Corporation, pointed to trouble spots like consumer price inflation, which recently dropped below 2 percent, as well as high borrowing costs, especially for small and medium-size firms.
"The conditions for further policy easing are ripe," Mr. Liu wrote in a note on Friday. "Today's rate cut suggests that the overall policy orientation has shifted to be more supportive."

Full text:   Suppose you told an economist these facts and only these facts: Long-term interest rates have fallen sharply over just a few months. Prices for oil and other much-needed commodities have been in free fall in the face of weak demand. Markets are predicting that inflation will be low in the years ahead and that the central bank will keep interest rates lower for longer.
Knowing only those facts, the economist would conclude that this country was staring down the barrel of a significant economic slowdown, and maybe even a recession.
What would that economist conclude, though, if stock prices are consistently rising toward record highs, job gains are the best in years, corporate sales and profits are rising, and business surveys and other real-time indicators of the economy point to steady expansion?
That country, of course, would seem to have a perfectly strong economic outlook. And as you have surely guessed, both these situations apply to the same country at the same time, which is to say the United States in November 2014.
This is the central paradox of the economy as the year nears its end. And the giant question facing the United States going into 2015 is which set of indicators are giving a more accurate view of where things are headed. In one telling, the nation is on track for the strongest year since the recovery began over five years ago; in another, Americans should brace for yet more sluggishness and uncertainty.
Looking solid as well are those pieces of data that usually serve as advance warning that the economy is faltering. The Conference Board's index of leading economic indicators rose a healthy 0.9 percent in October and hasn't logged a monthly decline since January. The stock market rally continued Friday after moves by the People's Bank of China and European Central Bank that signaled easier money ahead.
The trouble, if it can be called that, is in the corners of the bond and commodity markets that often presage problems in the economy.
When investors become more concerned about the economic outlook, they tend to shift money into bonds, tolerating lower yields in exchange for safety and the expectation of lower interest rates in the years ahead because of the weak economy. For example, a sharp decline in yields during the second half of 2007 foretold the recession that began in December of that year.
The yield on 10-year Treasury bonds has fallen to 2.31 percent as of Friday, from 3 percent earlier in the year.
And while the price of oil and other commodities is influenced by many factors other than the overall state of the domestic economy (supply, weather and so on), the steep sell-off since this summer has been an indicator that global demand is considerably weaker than had appeared likely as recently as the spring.
There are three basic ways to resolve the contradictions among these pieces of data, each with different implications for the United States economy in 2015 and beyond.
It's All Overseas
Maybe the moves in bond and commodity markets reflect a shortfall in economic growth outside the United States, and the American economy will continue to hum despite weakness almost everywhere else.
In this telling, the drop in bond yields and oil prices actually has little to do with what is happening in the United States, but rather is driven by the persistent weakness of the European and Japanese economies, paired with disappointing growth in once-strong emerging markets, including China and Brazil.
Weakness in those economies is creating a downdraft for commodity prices and stronger expectations of deflation, or falling prices, for years to come. Against that backdrop, Treasury bonds look like a good deal, despite their falling yields, because inflation is expected to keep coming in low, even as the American economy heats up. That globally driven low inflation will lead the Fed to keep interest rates low for longer.
Even if this narrative is correct, though, it raises a worrying problem: How long can the United States remain an island of solid growth in the face of a slumping world economy?
Markets Are Distorted
Maybe the various market-based indicators of where the economy is going are sending misleading signals because of idiosyncratic circumstances.
In this telling, the stock market and bond market are both booming simultaneously primarily because global central banks either already are (Bank of Japan) or soon will be (E.C.B.) engaged in large-scale buying of securities through quantitative easing.
And the commodity sell-off, in this telling, is less a signal of future economic weakness and more a consequence of factors peculiar to those markets. Supplies of oil are rising because of the American and Canadian energy boom. Supplies of corn and other agricultural products are booming thanks to better weather during the growing season this year.
And these two trends reinforce each other. Falling commodity prices mean lower inflation, which makes bonds more attractive, driving bond yields down further.
If this interpretation is correct, the markets aren't telling us much at all about the economic future.
A Slowing U.S. Economy?
Perhaps the situation in the United States is gloomier than the conventional economic measures are telling us so far. It could be, in this version, that this is a bit like the second half of 2007, when market measures pointed to a downturn but a recession didn't begin until December.
The drop in oil prices may partly reflect that industry in the United States is demanding less energy than in the recent past as it anticipates weaker demand. Perhaps the bond market knows something that just hasn't shown up in the official economic statistics yet.
Macroeconomic Advisers, a leading forecasting firm, has cut its estimate of how fast the economy is growing in the fourth quarter (now about midway over). It pegs it at 2.2 percent, down from 3 percent, and its November forecast has overall economic growth for the year below its previous estimate by half a percentage point.
If economic data remain strong over the next couple of months, it may be safe to toss out this possibility, but until then, the darkest timeline has to be considered, given the mixed messages that the global markets are sending.

Full text:   VIENNA -- Everything about the nuclear negotiations with Iran, now approaching a crucial moment, is complex: the international politics, the implications for the Middle East, and the science of how to prevent a nuclear energy project from turning into a nuclear weapons program. Here are answers to questions about the lead up to the diplomatic effort and what a comprehensive agreement might look like.
Q. How did Iran get started on its nuclear program?
A. With American help. It was the United States that provided Iran with its first small research reactor, provided to the shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, when Iran was a strong ally. But after he was exiled to the United States at the start of the Iranian revolution, Iran's first clerical ruler, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, appeared to have little interest in things atomic.
The program withered until 1985. International Atomic Energy Agency documents later showed that Iran began a uranium-enrichment program. Years later, American intelligence assessments concluded that before 2004, Iran had developed a full-scale weapons program. Iran denies that, saying the documents raising questions about suspected weapons work were fabricated. Intelligence assessments suggest that while Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader, halted the most visible elements of the program in late 2003, there has been sporadic work since, in a secret complex of military bases and in universities.
Q. What actions have the international community taken in an effort to halt Iran's activities?
A. Just about everything, including diplomacy, sanctions and sabotage. A decade ago, the European nations negotiated a full suspension of Iran's activities, but that ultimately broke down. The Bush administration passed up an opportunity to negotiate a deal when Iran had installed only a few hundred centrifuges, the giant machines that enrich uranium. Many in the Obama administration say that was a lost opportunity. Since then, Iran has installed more than 19,000 centrifuges even as the Obama administration planned aggressive sanctions, aimed chiefly at oil revenue and financial connections to the West. In public, American and European officials credit the sanctions for driving Iran to the negotiating table.
In private, some officials acknowledge significant work to sabotage Iran's program also has played a role. Defective parts have been slipped into Iran's supply channel, for example. Scientists and engineers have been assassinated in Tehran, actions widely attributed to Israel. The United States, in partnership with Israel, also started an ambitious cybersabotage effort, code-named Olympic Games, which was the first known American use of cyber weapons against another state. Started by the Bush administration, and accelerated by President Obama, the program sent a series of worms into the computers that run the Natanz enrichment plant, forcing hundreds of centrifuges to break.
Taken together, the sanctions and the sabotage were intended to raise the cost of the nuclear program and to make it clear to Iran that the West would seek to slow any enrichment efforts. The Iranians insist these actions have had the opposite effect, redoubling their determination to have an independent -- and they insist, peaceful -- enrichment capability. The sanctions and sabotage are often cited by hard-liners in Iran who argue that the United States and Europe cannot be trusted and are seeking to overthrow the government in Iran. If those views prevail in Iran's internal debates, it could derail any deal.
Q. What is each side hoping to achieve from the negotiations?
A. The Iranians want explicit acknowledgment of their right to make nuclear fuel, and eventually to make as much of it as they desire for peaceful purposes, they say. But they are also seeking an end to the crippling sanctions that have cut their oil revenues by more than half, devalued their currency and made it virtually impossible to conduct normal banking transactions around the world.
For their part, the United States and its negotiating partners -- Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China -- have said they want a system to cut off all of Iran's possible pathways to a bomb. That means they want to make sure Iran cannot produce enough uranium to allow it to race for a bomb. And they want an inspection system for Iran that is so comprehensive that the country could not pursue a covert effort to build a weapon in a hidden facility, or to buy one, presumably from North Korea or black market dealers.
The question is whether there is an acceptable middle ground that would allow Iran to declare that the West has acknowledged its right to enrich and left it with a significant capability to do so, while still satisfying the rest of the world that Iran is not on the threshold of a capability to build an atomic weapon.
Q. Many countries have nuclear programs. Why are we worried most about Iran?
A. There are the five declared nuclear weapon states: The United States, Britain, France, Russia and China. Pakistan, India and North Korea have all tested nuclear devices. Though it will not say, Israel is widely known to have an arsenal of more than 100 nuclear weapons. And there are dozens of nonweapon states with advanced nuclear know-how like Japan, with large nuclear stockpiles and lots of scientific expertise, which could make a weapon if it ever decided to.
So what's the worry about Iran? Israel cites the frequent statements by Iranian leaders declaring that the Jewish state should not exist. The Saudis fear a powerful Shia state, and say that if Iran gets the bomb, they will get one, too. Many other Gulf Arab states would do the same. Those declarations create a concern about a nuclear race that could devolve into an arms race in the Middle East. This is a matter of trust. There are countries the United States does not worry about with nuclear ability and there are countries like Pakistan that everyone worries about. Iran would be in that category.
Q. What are the possible outcomes from negotiations?
A. One possibility is no deal at all, a complete collapse of negotiations that have been going on now for more than a year. But that would not be in anyone's interest. Congress would most likely impose new sanctions and if the current temporary agreement, reached last year to give some time and space for these negotiations, is allowed to expire, Iran could resume producing a type of fuel that could be rapidly converted for weapons use.
So the most likely outcome is either a final agreement, some kind of muddled agreement in principle with the details to be worked out later or another extension in the talks.
Q. What has to happen in order to reach an agreement?
A. For any agreement to work, there needs to be three deals: One between the West and Iran, one between Mr. Obama and a skeptical Congress and one between the Iranian negotiators and Ayatollah Khamenei. The dynamics of the last two are murky. Mr. Obama wants to suspend sanctions bit by bit, as the Iranians deliver on their part of the deal, meaning Congress might not vote on this for years. That angers many Republicans, and even some Democrats, who say they want a vote. An even bigger mystery: Who makes the final decision in Iran? Presumably, it's Ayatollah Khamenei's call, but the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, the elite of Iran's military, will most likely have a big voice, too.
Q. What is the calculation for Iran?
A. The Iranians have a fundamental choice to make: Is the nuclear program worth it? Most ordinary Iranians tell pollsters that they support a civilian nuclear program in Iran, and very much want the West to show the kind of respect to the country that it shows to other nations with nuclear technology. And they say Iran has no interest in nuclear weapons, just what Ayatollah Khamenei has said, including a fatwa or legal opinion declaring that the country should never possess them. Iran has a young population, and it yearns for Western travel, Western education and Western respect. An end to sanctions would be a sign of a new era.
But inside the Iranian military, and among the clerics, Iran's nuclear program is both an insurance policy and a symbol of the nation's identity as a revolutionary state in a long struggle with the United States and its allies. Iranian leaders have periodically observed that since North Korea tested its nuclear devices, no one has dared push it to the brink. And it did not escape their notice that a decade after Libya gave up its entire nuclear program, its leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, was ousted an then killed by a combination of a national uprising and a European, Arab and American bombing campaign.
In the end, these negotiations are not only about nuclear capability, but also national pride and mutual reassurance. Iran does not want to be treated as an outlier, but rather as a great regional power. The international community needs the confidence that if the Iranians raced for a bomb, it would have plenty of notice and time to react.

Shares Extend Gains on Overseas Economic News

Full text:   Stocks capped a week that already had several record highs by delivering a couple more.
The Dow Jones industrial average and Standard & Poor's 500-stock index carved out new highs, not adjusted for inflation, on Friday, extending the market's gains for the week. It was the third closing high for the Dow in the week and the fourth for the S.&P. 500.
The latest gains extended a comeback in the S.&P. 500, which has increased 11 percent since plunging in mid-October and is up 11.6 percent for the year.
Investors on Friday cheered news of an interest-rate cut in China and the possibility that Europe's central bank would step up stimulus efforts.
"What it suggests is that these central banks are prepared to do even more to stimulate growth, to stimulate demand, and that always equates to better stock markets," said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist at Prudential Financial.
All 10 sectors in the S.&P. 500 index rose, with materials stocks climbing the most. The sector is up 9 percent this year. Energy stocks were among the big gainers, helped by a rebound in oil prices. Some traders expected OPEC to decide to cut production at a conference next week.
All told, the S.&P. 500 index rose 10.75 points, or 0.52 percent, to 2,063.50, just above the index's previous nominal high close a day before at 2,052.75.
The Dow gained 91.06 points, or 0.51 percent, to 17,810.06. Its previous high close was 17,719 on Thursday. The Dow has gained 7.4 percent this year. The Nasdaq composite index added 11.10 points, or 0.24 percent, to 4,712.97. The index is up 12.8 percent for the year.
A strong third-quarter earnings season, on top of a recent string of positive United States economic data on housing, jobs and manufacturing, has helped put investors in a buying mood. The prospect of central banks outside the United States increasing their own stimulus efforts is viewed as another positive for stock investors, particularly with the Federal Reserve winding down its huge bond-buying program this year.
"Central bank intervention is the No. 1 thing investors worldwide are looking at right now," said Mike Serio, regional chief investment officer at Wells Fargo Private Bank. "In the short run, that looks pretty good for stocks."
On Friday, China's central bank lowered the interest rate on its one-year loans to financial institutions by 0.4 percentage points, to 5.6 percent. The surprise cut came after recent figures showing that the country's annual growth rate slowed last quarter to a five-year low of 7.3 percent.
The president of the European Central Bank president, Mario Draghi, also caused a stir in the markets when he told a conference in Frankfurt that the bank was willing to "step up the pressure" and increase its efforts to stimulate Europe's struggling economy.
If current efforts do not achieve the desired effect, Mr. Draghi said, the central bank could "broaden even more the channels through which we intervene." For many in the markets, that was a clear hint that the bank could soon starting buying government bonds.
Beyond the talk of central bank stimulus, investors had their eye on the latest batch of corporate earnings on Friday.
Traders bid up shares in several companies that reported better-than-expected earnings, including the software maker Splunk and the sporting goods retailer Hibbett Sports. Splunk rose $1.99, or 3.1 percent, to $66.93. Hibbett gained $1.82, or 4 percent, to $47.75.
Ross Stores led the gains in the S.&P. 500, adding $6.09, or 7.3 percent, to $89.30.
The video game retailer Game-Stop and the clothing chain operator Gap slumped after delivering disappointing results. Game-Stop slid $5.68, or 13 percent, to $37.86. Gap fell $1.68, or 4.2 percent, to $38.46.
China's interest rate cut raised hopes for increased economic activity and oil demand. That helped lift oil prices. Benchmark crude gained 66 cents, to settle at $76.51 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, a benchmark for international oils used by many refineries in the United States, rose $1.03, to $80.36 on the ICE Futures exchange in London.
In other energy futures on the Nymex, wholesale gasoline rose 2.9 cents to close at $2.057 a gallon, heating oil rose 2.5 cents to close at $2.405 a gallon and natural gas fell 22.3 cents to close at $4.266 per 1,000 cubic feet.
In metals trading, gold rose $6.80, to $1,197.50 an ounce, and silver rose 26 cents, to $16.40 an ounce.
In the bond markets, interest rates declined. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.31 percent from 2.34 percent late Thursday.

Abstract: According to a 2013 survey by Blackbaud, a software provider for nonprofits, baby boomers -- those between the ages of 49 and 67 -- make up roughly one-third of adults who gave, and contributed 43 percent of all the dollars donated in the United States, an average of $1,212 a year across 4.5 charities.

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDEDTHREE dollars can go a long way.
Moviegoers 65 and older who bought tickets at the Bainbridge Cinemas or the Bainbridge Performing Arts center in Bainbridge Island, Wash., could pay full price for their ticket and have the $3 senior discount redirected to a local charity that provides child care to low-income families.
The program, called the Boomerang Giving project, raised $630 in a two-month trial this year.
"It was a good start," said David S. Harrison, who co-founded the group with his wife, Cindy, and five friends. Last week, the concept went national with the nonprofit's official start, and a number of organizations are already working on Boomerang Giving projects.
"We think the idea of providing baby boomers and older Americans the chance to 'give back' through donating discounts will become commonplace," said Mr. Harrison, 66, former director of the Nancy Bell Evans Center on Nonprofits and Philanthropy at the University of Washington's Evans School of Public Affairs.
The intent of the charity is to encourage older people in a financial position to forgo discounts they receive on public transportation, movies, restaurants and other outlets to invest in their community by donating, or redirecting, some or all of the savings to charities of their choice. "Many seniors do need their discounts, but not all do," said Mr. Harrison. "Why not let someone else benefit from that 'found' money?"
For now, the Boomerang Giving website allows consumers to track how much they save from their discounts over the course of a month or so. Then, they can select a nonprofit organization from the GuideStar database on the site and make a donation via the charity's partner, Network for Good.
Boomerang Giving is one of myriad ways charitable giving is getting up a head of steam. Charitable giving has rebounded in recent years, according to the 2014 Giving USA annual report from the Giving USA Foundation and its research partner, the Indiana University Lilly Family School of Philanthropy.
The $335.17 billion Americans gave to charity in 2013 was up 4.4 percent from 2012, coming close to 2007's prerecession peak of $349.50 billion (adjusted for inflation).
According to a 2013 survey by Blackbaud, a software provider for nonprofits, baby boomers -- those between the ages of 49 and 67 -- make up roughly one-third of adults who gave, and contributed 43 percent of all the dollars donated in the United States, an average of $1,212 a year across 4.5 charities. But it is people 68 and older who give away more in cold cash: $1,367 was the average donated annually across 6.2 charities, making up roughly one-fourth of givers. By comparison, Generation X -- people 33 to 48 -- report giving an average of $732 across 3.9 charities.
Regardless of the amount of the donation, though, giving to charity can be a victory not just for the recipient but also for the donor. A crucial conclusion from a study published last year in the International Journal of Happiness and Development by Lara B. Aknin of Simon Fraser University, in British Columbia and colleagues at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, and Harvard Business School, concluded that people feel good when they make a charitable donation -- especially through a friend, relative or social connection.
And Harvard researchers found in an experiment that donating to charity can increase physical strength. After giving $1 to Unicef, participants were able to squeeze a handgrip more than 20 seconds longer than nondonors, according to the lead researcher, Kurt Gray, now of the University of Maryland, College Park.
An increasingly popular way for retirees to stay active mentally and socially is to join a local giving circle.
For Claudie Williams, 64, of Washington Crossing, Pa., it was retiring seven years ago from a three-decade career in marketing and business development with health care companies that spurred her to join Impact100 Philadelphia, a giving circle whose members pool their money to make grants to local organizations.
"I got involved because a friend of mine was joining and I was at a point when I was thinking about what am I going to do beyond my career," Mrs. Williams said.
The circle consists of women whose ages range mostly from 45 to 80. Each donates $1,000 and their contributions are pooled to make one or more $100,000 grants annually to nonprofit groups.
To date, the circle has awarded grants totaling more than $1.2 million to 24 groups. Membership is expected to top 300 this year.
"If you're living on a fixed income in retirement, the urge to give may be strong, but it's critical to approach it as you would any investment," said Judith Ward, a certified financial planner at T. Rowe Price.
Contributions to a majority of public charities are deductible as long as the donation doesn't exceed 50 percent of adjusted gross income.
Retirees might even be able to bump up their contributions with some help from their former employers. For example, Johnson & Johnson donates $1 for every $1 retirees donate to qualified nonprofit organizations, up to a maximum $10,000 company contribution per year. IBM retirees can make donations directly from their IBM pensions. "Retirees like the ease and automation of having their donations directly transferred from their pension," said Ari Fishkind, an IBM spokesman.
Before deciding how much to give to charity, make sure your retirement accounts are solid and you have enough money to avoid outliving your savings, Ms. Ward said. Several web-based retirement calculators including T. Rowe Price's Retirement Income Calculator, Fidelity's Retirement Income Planner, and Vanguard's Retirement Expenses Worksheet, can give you a feel for how much room there is in your budget for giving.
Since there is very little regulation of the 1.1 million charities in this country, says Ken Stern, author of "With Charity for All: Why Charities Are Failing and a Better Way to Give," it is important no matter what your age to choose carefully.
Mr. Stern's advice: First, consider charities that are working for your values. Then make time to seek out the ones that can prove they're having the impact they say they are. By scribbling checks to the charity that has sent the most requests or bombarded you with phone calls, you're only rewarding the best marketers.
For help reviewing a charity, check out organizations like GiveWell or The Life You Can Save Foundation, which have spent thousands of hours researching the best charities, he said. Go to a charity's website and review its reports. "The best charities will publish specific goals, research and evidence-based assessments on their websites and elsewhere," Mr. Stern said.
The free watchdog websites Charity Navigator and the Better Business Bureau's National Charity Report Index also evaluate charities on what percentage of their revenue goes to concrete programs and what is earmarked for administrative and fund-raising costs. If you want to learn more about large American charities than these sites provide, you can donate $50 to CharityWatch, and you'll receive its Charity Rating Guide of roughly 600 groups.
Another way to fund charitable contributions that have been vetted to some degree is through a donor-advised fund. This is a charitable account -- the minimum contribution typically starts at $5,000 -- set up through a charity, some of which are affiliated with financial services firms, like a mutual fund or brokerage. Account holders can recommend grants to charities of their choice.
At Fidelity Charitable, for example, over 50 percent of accounts are under $25,000, and you can grant as little as $50 to a charity, said Amy N. Danforth, president of Fidelity Charitable.
Some people who want to give, but not right now, opt to name a charity as the beneficiary of their I.R.A., according to Ms. Ward. "This is often good strategy for single retirees," she said. "For married couples, you only do this if you're certain your surviving spouse or other dependents won't need the funds." The charity receives the funds tax-free, and your estate will also be eligible for a charitable deduction.
You can also split your I.R.A. into separate accounts and earmark a portion for charity and the rest to your spouse or children.
A parting note: "Whether you're an individual donor, or a small-business owner, you can do more than just write a check. Ask, 'What more can I do?,' " said Jenny Lawson, vice president for corporate strategies at Points of Light, a national volunteering group.
"The question opens doors for volunteering on all levels -- from office support to strategic planning to serving on a board," Ms. Lawson said. "You and the charity will get more out of your donation when you give your time and talent, too."

Correction: February 2, 2015, Monday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article in the Personal Business pages on Nov. 22, about donating senior discounts to charities, erroneously included an organization among watchdog websites that evaluate charities on their program, administrative and fund-raising costs. While Charity Navigator and the Better Business Bureau's National Charity Report Index provide such services, GuideStar does not. A GuideStar representative's message pointing out this error was misdirected at The Times.

Full text:   MOSCOW -- Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. in Kiev on Friday condemned Russia for its "unacceptable" military intervention in Ukraine, while exhorting Ukraine's newly elected government to complete its democratic and anticorruption reforms.
During a joint news conference, Mr. Biden urged Ukraine's president, Petro O. Poroshenko, to form a new government "in days, not weeks," and to champion economic reforms, promote further economic integration with the West and root out what Mr. Biden called "the cancer of corruption."
"Even if the guns in the east fell silent tomorrow, Ukraine would still face a struggle for its democratic and economic future here in Kiev," Mr. Biden said on the first anniversary of the beginning of public protests that led to the former government's ouster in February. "There is a lot of work to do in Kiev."
One year after the Maidan, as the popular revolution is called in the country, Ukraine is mired in economic and military crises. Amid soaring inflation and capital flight, the $17 billion in loans promised to Ukraine by the International Monetary Fund "appears insufficient to close the external financing gap," Timothy Ash, head of emerging-market research at Standard Bank, said in an investor's note on Thursday.
Passions are running high among the citizenry as well. Mr. Biden was forced to cut short a visit to a memorial for those killed during the revolution in the face of an angry protest over the failure of the Poroshenko government to bring to justice the people responsible for the killings.
Meanwhile, international diplomatic efforts to halt the conflict in Ukraine's southeast have faltered, with the West accusing Russia of continuing to supply men, money and weapons to the pro-Russian separatists.
Mr. Biden called Moscow's annexation of the Crimean Peninsula a "flagrant violation of the bedrock principles of the international system" and condemned the rebel-held elections on Nov. 2 as a "Kremlin-orchestrated farce."
He also demanded that President Vladimir V. Putin cease backing the separatists.
"Do what you agreed to do, Mr. Putin," Mr. Biden said.
More than 1,000 people have died since a cease-fire accord was signed on Sept. 5, according to new data released by the United Nations on Thursday. The conflict has left 4,317 dead and 9,921 wounded since mid-April, the report said.
With NATO reporting that Russia is moving tanks, artillery and air-defense systems into the country, Ukrainian officials say they are prepared to repulse a new offensive.
A Ukrainian military spokesman on Friday accused Russia of resuming shelling over the border for the first time since the cease-fire was signed.
The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, a German newspaper, reported Friday that a separatist leader in Donetsk, Igor Martinov, had confirmed that, since the summer, the separatists had received "a lot" of Russian money to help finance public services and pay wages and pensions that the Ukrainian government had cut off. He did not give a figure.
Asked about the report, a German government spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said that the remarks confirmed the Western view of the Kremlin's role in the crisis, despite Moscow's denials of involvement.
"Without Russia's military and financial support we simply wouldn't have the violent separatism that we are currently experiencing in these regions," Mr. Seibert said.
Russia strongly denies providing material support to the rebels. It has also issued stern warnings to the West about delivering weapons to the Ukrainian government.
"I believe that the United States is one of the initiators of this conflict," Nikolai Patrushev, the secretary of Russia's Security Council, said on Thursday. "If it sells weapons to them, the conflict will grow."
President Obama declined to supply lethal aid when Mr. Poroshenko requested it during his visit to Washington in September. But on Wednesday, the deputy national security adviser, Tony Blinken, said that lethal aid "remains on the table. It is something we are looking at."
Mr. Biden did not address lethal aid during his remarks on Friday, announcing only a further $20 million in aid for law enforcement and judicial reform.
Also on Friday, the Dutch government announced that it had found new human remains and secured more wreckage from the Malaysia Airlines flight shot down in July. The crash killed all 298 people aboard. The situation at the wreckage site remained unstable, a statement on a government website said, and a team at the site would need several more days to complete its work.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The sluggish pace of inflation is replacing unemployment as the main reason the Federal Reserve is not ready to start raising interest rates.
The members of the Fed's policy-making committee saw little reason to shift course at their most recent meeting in late October, according to an official account published Wednesday. Economic growth and job growth remain unusually steady, and Fed officials continued to predict both trends would continue.
But the stability of the Fed's plans obscures a shift in the focus of its concerns. Even as officials are increasingly heartened by evidence that the labor market is improving, they are worried about signs that inflation is rising too slowly. Low inflation impedes economic adjustments, and raises the specter of deflation.
"Inflation hazard light trumps labor market dashboard," was the summary offered by Michael Feroli, chief United States economist for JPMorgan Chase.
The Fed's account also made clear that policy makers were not particularly worried about signs of economic weakness in Europe and Asia, nor about recent market volatility.
"It was observed that if foreign economic or financial conditions deteriorated further, U.S. economic growth over the medium term might be slower than currently expected," the account said. "However, many participants saw the effects of recent developments on the domestic economy as likely to be quite limited."
Officials also viewed concerns about other economies as the main reason for jitters last month in financial markets. The account played down their significance, noting financial conditions "remained highly accommodative," meaning borrowing costs had not increased in response. If the problems are restricted to Wall Street, the account suggested, the Fed is not likely to adjust its course.
The Fed ended the expansion of its bond holdings at its October meeting, completing a plan announced well in advance because officials concluded the economy does not need as much stimulus.
The Fed's post-meeting statement, however, said it still planned to hold short-term interest rates near zero for a "considerable time." A number of Fed officials have endorsed the interpretation that the central bank is most likely to start raising short-term rates in mid-2015.
The account, released after a standard three-week delay, said that a couple of officials wanted the Fed to signal that it may raise rates sooner, and a couple wanted the Fed to signal that it may wait longer. But a majority remained constant.
Fed officials generally agree that labor market conditions are improving more quickly than they expected. Nonetheless, most officials still see evidence of considerable slack, including the unusually large number of part-time workers who say they cannot find full-time work.
But the trend is clear: More people are finding jobs, and more people are quitting jobs to seek better opportunities.
"The U.S. labor market has shown substantial improvement," William C. Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said last week in Abu Dhabi, even as he cautioned, "There still is a meaningful gap between where we are and full employment."
The unemployment rate, which fell to 5.8 percent in October, is getting closer to the level Fed officials regard as normal, 5.2 percent to 5.5 percent. If inflation were rising at a normal pace, it is unlikely the Fed would wait much longer to start raising rates.
"Over the next year, it will become more and more difficult to point to labor market performance as a rationale for a near-zero policy rate," James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, said last week.
But inflation is not rising at what the Fed calls a healthy pace. The annualized pace has been less than 2 percent for 29 months, according to the Fed's preferred measure, the Commerce Department's index of personal consumption expenditures.
More worrisome for the Fed, investors and consumers appear to expect less inflation in coming years. The Fed focuses on measures of expectations because monetary policy acts gradually, so decisions reflect the Fed's best guess about future conditions.
Measures of inflation expectations derived from asset prices have fallen sharply in recent months, but Fed officials note that such measures are prone to distortion by other factors, such as swings in market demand for government bonds.
The minutes said that a couple of officials "noted that it was likely too early to draw conclusions," while others urged continued scrutiny. The account added that a downturn in expectations would be more worrisome if accompanied by slower growth.
Since the meeting, two influential survey measures of inflation expectations also declined.
Recent declines in energy prices are suppressing inflation in the near term. The account said most Fed officials continue to predict that inflation will gradually return to the preferred 2 percent annual pace. The Fed focuses on measures of inflation that exclude energy prices precisely because of such volatility.
But the account said that a few officials "expressed concern that inflation might persist below the committee's objective for quite some time." One of those officials, Narayana Kocherlakota, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, cited slow inflation in dissenting from the decision to end bond buying.
Referring to the weakness in inflation expectations, Krishna Guha, an analyst at Evercore ISI, said, "We believe some firming is likely required before the Fed would contemplate raising rates."
But Eric Green of TD Securities said economic growth would still dictate the Fed's timing.

Full text:   MOSCOW -- Boris Akimov's cellphone, which quacks like a duck, started to sound like a whole flock soon after President Vladimir V. Putin imposed sweeping food sanctions barring many Western imports last August.
Major Russian grocery chains, desperate to find new suppliers, tracked down Mr. Akimov, the founder of Russia's fledgling farm-to-table movement, to ask urgent supply questions. How many chickens and eggs could he provide, they wanted to know, and could he deliver 100 tons of cheese, say, immediately.
Mr. Akimov, 36, who has a heavy beard and an infectious grin, had to turn them away -- his 100 farmers produce nowhere near the amounts requested. LavkaLavka, the organic farm cooperative he and a friend set up about five years ago, sells between six and 12 tons of artisanal cheese annually, for example.
"The main thing which the sanctions have already changed is in people's minds -- in government, in business and on the streets, they have started to think more about where their food comes from," Mr. Akimov said in an interview in his new, homey restaurant in central Moscow, where the light fixtures are sawed-off milk cans painted red. "If the sanctions give a chance to develop local farmers, to develop sustainable agriculture, it is very good. But I am not sure it will happen."
In August, Russia banned all beef, pork, fish, fruit, vegetables and dairy products from the European Union, the United States, Canada, Australia and Norway for one year, retaliating for Western economic sanctions imposed after the Kremlin destabilized Ukraine.
Senior leaders, starting with Mr. Putin, heralded food sanctions as a chance for Russians to finally stock their larders with homegrown products. Dmitri A. Medvedev, the prime minister, released a "road map" for agriculture last month. "The aim of our efforts is to increase our own agricultural produce and to reduce Russia's dependence on food imports," he said.
But the content of the road map was basically "watch this space," with new agricultural policies promised by the end of 2015.
Critics said the government typically announced the sanctions first and thought about the fallout afterward. A range of experts and organizations noted that beyond the populist, patriotic speeches about growing food locally, there is minimal government support when it comes to supplying the new land, long-term credit and transportation logistics that Russian farmers desperately need to expand.
Flying over France's Cognac region two years ago, Mr. Akimov noticed that every field, every lake, every copse was neatly groomed and exploited -- there was no space for new projects. "If you looked at Russia there is nothing, nothing, nothing -- you can do everything," he said.
Russian agriculture basically collapsed twice in the 20th century. Immediately after the revolution, the new Bolshevik government organized what amounted to gangs licensed to strip the countryside of anything edible to feed the agitated urban poor. Output dropped to half what it had been in 1913.
Production had just recovered when forced collectivization started in 1928. Stalin decided that Russian grain exports would underwrite large-scale industrialization, and by 1937, 90 percent of Russian farmers had been pushed onto collective farms. Those who resisted were killed or sent to the gulag.
After the Soviet Union disintegrated, the government advanced large-scale corporate farming and basically favored imports.
"Peasants have always been second-class citizens -- during the czarist era, during Soviet times and still today," said Vladimir V. Miloserdov, an agriculture expert raised on a collective farm in southern Russia, who vividly recalls the maximum two sacks of grain his family received as its annual salary.
In the last 20 years, more than 106 million acres of arable land have fallen out of production, Mr. Miloserdov said, and Russia has fewer cattle now than it did in the 1940s.
Experts agree that is a sorry state of affairs for the largest country on earth.
Far from spurring production, sanctions so far have served mostly to raise food prices. Inflation has risen to 8.3 percent this year, well above the anticipated 6 percent, with the rise attributed to escalating food prices as local producers exploit shortages or importers pass on the costs of shipping in salmon from places like Chile instead of nearby Norway.
Prices for meat and poultry rose more than 18 percent through October, while dairy products were up by over 15 percent, according to the federal statistics agency, Rosstat.
"Russia cannot provide itself with dairy products, fish, vegetables and other types of food," said Mikhail Anshakov, the head of the Society for the Protection of Consumer Rights, which calls for food sanctions to be rescinded. "Self-imposed sanctions under these circumstances were madness."
The public has generally supported the sanctions, however, because the Kremlin wrapped the idea in nationalist colors, and state-run television regularly broadcasts programs showing supermarkets bursting with goods from Africa, Asia and Latin America. While the foreign news media tend to focus on the dismay of the urban elite over the sudden dearth of oysters and foie gras, Mr. Anshakov said, the real story is the potential gap in providing staples like milk.
Dairy farms have plenty of forage at the end of summer, he said, but with winter comes the main challenge to farming in Russia -- virtually the entire country freezes. At that point dairy companies usually import vast amounts of powdered milk to mix with real milk, Mr. Anshakov said. "Now with the sanctions that is impossible," he said, with powdered milk from traditional suppliers barred.
Some farmers, however, have been slightly gleeful about their prospects under sanctions.
Justus Walker, an American immigrant farmer in Siberia, became a YouTube sensation for a short news clip showing him laughing at the thought that he could finally sell the mozzarella he produces because the cheaper Italian variety would no longer be available.
Chicken is another example. Only about 10 percent of chickens sold in Russia come from abroad, mostly from the United States. Sanctions were a gold mine for local producers as imports no longer kept prices down.
But experts said that over the long run higher prices would not overcome more basic problems faced by small local farmers like those who sell through LavkaLavka. (Lavka means "little shop" in Russian.)
Andrey Ovchinnikov, 53, worked as an interior designer when a friend's endeavor persuaded him to become a chicken farmer. Sales went well, but he could get neither the credit nor the land to expand. He raises thousands of birds on less than an acre. Since his farm sits about 50 miles from Moscow, prime country for dachas, the local government has been reluctant to give him land it can sell at a premium.
After almost a year of cajoling, he finally persuaded local officials to at least visit his farm this month. "I cannot say the government is really paying attention to agriculture yet, but at least they are looking in our general direction," he said.
LavkaLavka has made getting that attention its mission.
The cooperative started after Mr. Akimov, then the creative director for an online magazine, and his friend Sasha Mikhailov, an information technology specialist, started paging through the most famous cookbook from czarist times, "A Gift to Young Housewives." The two men kept stumbling across unfamiliar root vegetables like rutabagas, parsnips and scorzonera.
"When you read this book you wonder how many interesting things there were, how many delicious things we had here in Russia that disappeared during the Soviet period," Mr. Akimov said.
The two began rooting around in farmers markets near Moscow for ingredients, and eventually their hobby "changed from a hedonistic project to a social project" to support local, organic farmers, Mr. Akimov said. They now run five shops, two small cafes and a restaurant.
Members of the collective hope sanctions stick around long enough for Russians to start exploring their own food, not just substitute imports from China or Turkey for what once came from the United States and Europe.
To try to speed that process, LavkaLavka has started monthly food festivals celebrating something local. This month it is the parsnip, which is called pasternak in Russian, just like the surname of the "Doctor Zhivago" author.
"If you ask a Russian what is a pasternak, he will say a famous writer," Mr. Akimov said, "It is a vegetable, but nobody knows it."

Full text:   FRANKFURT -- The president of the European Central Bank on Monday gave a slightly more optimistic assessment of the eurozone's economy, saying that a decline in bank lending appears to have reversed and pointing out that the economies in most countries in the region are growing.
"We have a certain amount of confidence that the credit cycle is now turning for the better," Mario Draghi, the E.C.B. president, told members of the European Parliament in Brussels.
A lack of bank credit for businesses has been one of the fundamental problems in the eurozone, so a turnaround would be good news for the region's economy. That is particularly true in countries like Italy, where companies are especially dependent on banks, as opposed to capital markets, to finance expansion and hiring.
Mr. Draghi acknowledged that economic performance was still "dismal" and that unemployment was unacceptably high. He repeated that the bank would be prepared to buy government bonds in order to stimulate the economy if the measures it had taken so far did not prove to be effective enough.
Mr. Draghi's appearance before the Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs came three days after official figures showed that the eurozone grew at an annualized rate of 0.6 percent in the third quarter. While that pace of growth was hardly torrid, Mr. Draghi noted that only two of the 18 countries in the eurozone -- Italy and Cyprus -- were in recession.
"Our expectation for a moderate recovery in 2015 and 2016 remains in place," Mr. Draghi said.
His statement, though incrementally more upbeat, was consistent with others he has made in recent months, in which he has left the door open to the same "quantitative easing" used by the Federal Reserve in the United States and other central banks to stimulate their economies.
The European Central Bank has been edging closer to large-scale purchases of government bonds, which are seen as an essential component of quantitative easing. But the bank also seems to hope that this controversial step will not be necessary.
Mr. Draghi said he thought that previous measures by the bank were beginning to show results, including low interest rates and a program that grants loans to banks on very favorable terms, if they in turn lend the money to businesses and individuals.
If those measures do not do the job, he said, repeating an assurance from two weeks ago, "the governing council is willing and stands ready to act."
The central bank is already buying private-sector assets, but the amounts are seen as too small to have a major impact on the economy, at least so far. On Monday, the bank said that it had bought about 3.1 billion euros, or $3.9 billion, in covered bonds last week. Covered bonds typically are real estate loans packaged as debt and guaranteed by the issuing banks.
In a separate speech, a European Central Bank official said that the bank could also buy gold, stocks or other securities traded on exchanges.
But the official, Yves Mersch, a member of the bank's six-member executive board, listed numerous reasons why quantitative easing, and in particular large-scale purchases of government bonds, might not work as well in Europe as it did in the United States.
The Federal Reserve "operates in a completely different environment than the E.C.B.," Mr. Mersch said at a banking conference in Frankfurt.
Bond purchases aimed at pushing down long-term interest rates would have less effect in Europe, Mr. Mersch said, because most credit flows through banks rather than capital markets.
He also expressed concern that if some governments defaulted on debt purchased by the bank, it would face a conflict between printing money to cover the losses and keeping inflation under control.
Mr. Mersch acknowledged that quantitative easing could have a positive psychological effect on markets. But he said he was concerned that government bond purchases by the bank would effectively make eurozone taxpayers liable for each country's debt, without the approval of elected officials. National governments in the eurozone are ultimately liable for any losses suffered by the bank.
"It is questionable to what extent it would be justifiable to communalize credit risks," Mr. Mersch said.
He noted that many of the calls for the E.C.B. to begin quantitative easing come from the United States and Britain.
Mr. Mersch said he wished "that these well-meaning suggestions were based on thorough understanding of the institutional and legal limits of the E.C.B. as well as the economical particularities of the euro area."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Abstract: Mr. Abe's program, called Abenomics, at first relied on a one-two punch of government spending and financial support from the Bank of Japan, the country's central bank. "What Japan shows is that if you have longstanding economic stagnation, having an aggressive monetary policy and even sizable fiscal reform is not going to work without deep-rooted structural reform," Mr. Kirkegaard said.

Full text:   PARIS -- Japan looked like the model for economic revival. Growth was back on track. The stock market was surging. Inflation, which had eluded Japan for decades, was even returning.
But Japan's grand economic experiment, a combination of fiscal discipline and monetary stimulus, is collapsing. On Monday, the country unexpectedly fell into recession, a downturn that has painful implications for the rest of the world.
Japan's unorthodox strategy was supposed to offer a road map for other troubled economies, notably Europe. Fiscal belt-tightening and tax increases, while leaning on the central bank to pump money into the economy, was expected to help overcome a malaise.
The formula, though, has failed to ignite a meaningful recovery in Japan -- and has even added to its woes. Europe must now decide whether to follow Japan's lead by injecting more money into the economy, as the region's central bank considers a similarly aggressive bond-buying campaign known as quantitative easing. And the United States, which just ended its own six-year stimulus effort, doesn't offer much of a cushion should other economies stumble further.
"The United States is about the only growth beacon in the global economy right now, and that is not a very nice place to be," said Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, an economist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. "An American growth pickup is positive, but it looks like the rest of the world is again going to be relying on the U.S. as a consumer of last resort."
Japan's prime minister, Shinzo Abe, won power two years ago on a promise to pull the economy out of nearly two decades of corrosive wage and price declines. The initial response of both Japanese consumers and global investors was ebullient: The economy surged during the first few months of his administration in early 2013, and Japanese stock prices soared.
Mr. Abe's program, called Abenomics, at first relied on a one-two punch of government spending and financial support from the Bank of Japan, the country's central bank. The bank sharply increased its program of buying government bonds and other assets, similar to the stimulus effort recently ended by the United States Federal Reserve.
In some ways, Japan has been more aggressive than the United States. Its bond-buying program, which was expanded last month, is now bigger relative to the size of its economy than the Fed's was at its peak.
Much of the enthusiasm for Abenomics has evaporated, however. Some economists blame a lack of action by Mr. Abe's government in areas beyond pump-priming stimulus, such as deregulation and trade.
A turn toward tighter fiscal policy has taken the majority of the blame. Government data released on Monday showed that the country unexpectedly fell into recession in the third quarter, hampered by rising sales taxes that have discouraged consumers from spending. Mr. Abe is expected to shelve a second tax increase, lest the Japanese economy and consumer confidence erode further.
"What Japan shows is that if you have longstanding economic stagnation, having an aggressive monetary policy and even sizable fiscal reform is not going to work without deep-rooted structural reform," Mr. Kirkegaard said. "The experience of Japan must be at the top of the minds of European leaders."
High on the agenda is whether Europe should pursue large-scale purchases of government bonds, so-called quantitative easing.
The European Central Bank recently said it was prepared to take additional steps to revive the struggling economy, by lending more to banks and buying bonds backed by mortgages and other assets. Critics say the bank has not acted nearly aggressively enough to help revive growth, which has essentially stagnated.
The similarities between the two places is strong, which has prompted some economists to wonder whether Europe will turn into another Japan.
Europe and Japan have stuck with various versions of austerity, neither pushing ahead with deep-seated changes to their economy that analysts say are needed to revive long-term growth. Europe is also increasingly facing down the Japan-like specter of deflation as a recovery lags.
The political debate is also developing along the same lines.
A number of countries, led by France and Italy, recently balked at European Union requirements to doggedly adhere to fiscal targets and eschew stimulus spending that some economists say is critical. Some economists say that Japan's situation only adds to the argument that fiscal belt-tightening, while sometimes needed to mend a country's finances, hurts growth when an economy is in decline.
European politicians now widely blame austerity policies for delaying a return to growth, but Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany is wary of loosening requirements for fiscal discipline after runaway debt levels and high deficits helped generate the eurozone debt crisis. The region's leaders are scheduled to meet in early December to discuss further strategies for growth.
"The main implication is we are beginning to see what it might look like in Europe if we go down that road," said Bart van Ark, chief economist for the Conference Board, referring to Japan's recession.
"Europe has the potential to become a second Japan in terms of significantly slowing demographics, and weak per capita income growth," he said. The Japanese experience shows that efforts to keep the economy afloat with more inflation and growth don't help sustain higher growth in the long term. What's needed, he said, is a "reform agenda, and that is a very difficult strategy" for politicians to pursue in any country.
The problems in Europe and Japan put additional pressure on the United States and China, which face their own headwinds.
The United States increased at a healthy 3.5 percent annualized pace in the third quarter, and unemployment has fallen below 6 percent. But troubling signs remain, including less-than-robust consumer spending and a lift from military spending that may be temporary.
China, too, is under pressure. Growth in China has cooled to 7.3 percent. While that is the envy of many countries, a slow clip by Chinese standards has raised questions about the nation's economic health.
The disparate issues -- a weak recovery in Europe, slowing growth in China and other emerging markets, as well as Japan's failure to sustain any sort of a turnaround -- have rung alarm bells in Washington.
Last week, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said in a speech in Seattle that the United States was increasingly being relied upon to perform as locomotive for a global recovery.
"But the global economy cannot prosper broadly relying on the United States to be the importer of first and last resort, nor can it rely on the United States to grow fast enough to make up for weak growth in major world economies," he said.

Abstract: The price of a barrel has dropped 30 percent since June, and the ripples have only begun, with analysts warning of everything from bankruptcies of Texas oil fields to economic troubles in big oil-producing nations like Venezuela and Nigeria. People want to buy different cars; airlines fly different routes at different prices; investment in alternative energy sources becomes more or less viable; oil-producing countries can be flush or starving.

Full text:   The market for crude oil is in veritable free fall. The price of a barrel has dropped 30 percent since June, and the ripples have only begun, with analysts warning of everything from bankruptcies of Texas oil fields to economic troubles in big oil-producing nations like Venezuela and Nigeria.
If oil prices stay low or keep falling, it will be one of the most important trends shaping the world economy in 2015, which raises the question: Why is this happening? To answer that, it is useful to look at the market for another fluid that is stored in barrels, one that is less economically consequential but quite a bit more tasty: bourbon.
As it turns out, oil producers from Dallas to Abu Dhabi could learn a few things from the Kentucky distilleries that turn out nectarlike whiskeys.
What oil and bourbon have in common are the long time lags between investment in a new supply and availability of the finished product. With bourbon, that's because a distiller must keep the good stuff in barrels for seven, 10, or even 20 years before it's ready to drink. With oil, it's because investment in new drilling projects is a slow-moving affair, frequently involving years of complex engineering and construction before the crude starts to flow.
The result for both is that supply is basically fixed in the short run. The amount of oil available in the near future is determined by investment decisions that oil producers made years ago. This creates big swings in prices over long time horizons that have broad effects on everything from the cars we drive to the politicians who win office.
The current sell-off in oil, for example, has its roots in actions taken in the middle of the last decade. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, oil was cheap -- under $20 a barrel at the end of 2001. Those low prices left oil producers with little incentive to invest in drilling. Global investment in new production was only about $200 billion in 2004, according to estimates by an energy research firm, I.H.S. Herold.
But early this century, economic growth in emerging nations was stronger than oil producers had predicted, and the demand for energy soared. Years of underinvestment because of low prices started to become a problem. By 2008, the price of oil topped $140 a barrel, and investment approached $500 billion.
Now, the world finds itself living under the opposite circumstances. The increase in exploration that began in the last decade is starting to pay off in a big way, including a boom in the United States. After reaching five million barrels of oil a day in 2008, domestic crude output was up to 7.5 million in 2013 and is still rising.
Meanwhile, the gaudy growth rates in China and other emerging markets of the middle of the last decade have given way to slower expansion, and the giant economies of Europe, Japan and the United States have underperformed after years of crisis.
"We're not going to see a synchronized global economic boom anytime soon," said Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of I.H.S. and author of "The Quest," a book about the global oil market. "These cycles of investment and lumpiness of new supplies coming on, and of market reactions and economic cycles, are all at work. What's the adjustment mechanism? It's price."
But the volatility of the last decade in the price of oil comes at a cost. Entirely different economic arrangements make sense when oil is $70 a barrel and when it is $140. People want to buy different cars; airlines fly different routes at different prices; investment in alternative energy sources becomes more or less viable; oil-producing countries can be flush or starving.
In other words, these cycles in oil prices are drastic, and can have real consequences in making it harder for businesses and societies to make long-term decisions. It can work against the interests of the oil producers themselves; the higher prices get, the more consumers and businesses have incentive to invest in efficiency and alternative energy sources.
Which brings us back to the bourbon market.
What is happening now in the market for high-quality bourbon is basically the opposite of what is happening with oil (or is parallel to what was happening with oil in 2007 and 2008). Over the last decade, bourbon has become the buzzy distilled spirit, as people who once favored vodka have discovered the appeal of bourbon brands like Pappy Van Winkle, Basil Hayden's and Elijah Craig.
But just as oil producers can't turn the spigot on new oil supplies overnight, the years that bourbon must spend in barrels have left producers behind the curve in keeping up with demand.
"In 2002 we would have been making Buffalo Trace to be sold in 2011," said Mark Brown, the chief executive of Buffalo Trace Distillery. "There was absolutely no indication that demand would have reached the levels it reached."
In the oil market, a global commodity with countless buyers and sellers, price is the only adjustment mechanism. But bourbon makers are, in many cases, trying to avoid raising their prices much.
"We've been adamant about not raising our prices to our distributors much beyond the cost of goods and inflation," Mr. Brown said. "The reason for that is very simple. We're in this business for the long term. Just because bourbon is hot right now doesn't change our way of thinking to say let's take advantage of the situation."
Buffalo Trace and other bourbon makers try to carefully allocate their product to distributors around the country at what is, effectively, slightly below the market-clearing price. A result is headlines like "The Great Whiskey Shortage of 2013." On the gray market, bottles of 23-year-old Pappy Van Winkle reach four-figure prices.
But the bet the bourbon industry is making is that there is more money to be made in the long run by cultivating a new generation of bourbon drinkers among young adults, and by building loyalty among customers in all corners of the United States, and eventually the world.
It's not quite what Economics 101 would tell you to do, but it may be the right recipe for eliminating the boom-and-bust cycle that has made the oil business so volatile.

Abstract: On Tuesday, however, Eike Batista, once one of the country's richest and most flamboyant men, is scheduled to defend himself in court against accusations of insider trading and stock market manipulation. Amid the turmoil, Mr. Batista transferred ownership of multimillion-dollar homes in Rio de Janeiro and in a nearby beach resort to his wife and sons in what he has since said was routine estate planning.

Full text:   SÃO PAULO, Brazil -- When it comes to insider trading in the United States, government officials have built careers on successful prosecutions. Hedge funds have been shut down, and regulators have ensnared even low-level employees who traded on confidential tips.
But in Brazil, no one has ever gone to jail for insider trading.
On Tuesday, however, Eike Batista, once one of the country's richest and most flamboyant men, is scheduled to defend himself in court against accusations of insider trading and stock market manipulation.
Many Brazilians will be closely following the case, not only to watch Mr. Batista's fate, but also to see if the justice system can shake off its reputation for endless delays and for leniency toward those accused of white-collar crime.
Prosecutors accuse Mr. Batista of trading on the stock of his petroleum company, OGX, after having advance knowledge about key petroleum fields' lack of economic viability.
In seeking to convict him, prosecutors may also be seeking to restore confidence in the country's institutions. The economy is stagnant, inflation is high, and continuing investigations into corruption in the petroleum giant Petrobras are reaching further into the ranks of government and leading corporations.
Anger over the judicial system is widespread, with nationwide street protests last year sometimes citing the "impunity" of the rich and powerful.
Mr. Batista's case could be a litmus test of how tough the courts can be. The prosecution is claiming that Mr. Batista's actions caused 1.5 billion reais (about $580 million) in damages, which he could have to repay.
For years, Mr. Batista was a symbol of Brazil's growing economic might. He founded and listed six companies on the São Paulo stock exchange, and for a time he was the country's richest man, worth over $30 billion.
Institutional investors, including the fund giants Pimco and BlackRock, invested in his companies. The governments of former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and current President Dilma Rousseff also supported Mr. Batista's companies with over 6 billion reais ($2.3 billion) in subsidized loans from a state-owned bank, Bndes.
Mr. Batista's lavish lifestyle included mansions and yachts, and sports cars that he parked in his living room. He published an autobiography subtitled "The Path of Brazil's Greatest Entrepreneur."
But that image quickly unraveled as one by one, his companies went bankrupt, transferred ownership or sold key assets.
Mr. Batista's current legal problems began in October 2012, when he promised to inject $1 billion into the petroleum company he founded, OGX, if management requested it.
His pledge propped up the company's stock for a few months, but the next May, he began to sell millions of shares.
In July the company acknowledged that key petroleum fields were economically unviable. Then in September 2013, just after he had sold millions more shares, management requested the $1 billion but Mr. Batista said that a change in the company's business plan had released him from his commitment.
The following month OGX defaulted on $5.8 billion in debt and filed for what became Latin America's largest-ever corporate bankruptcy. The company has since been reorganized, and creditors may get some of their money back eventually, but shareholders were wiped out.
Mr. Batista's lead lawyer, Sérgio Bermudes, did not respond to emails and phone calls requesting comment. But in documents filed with the court, the defense has argued that Mr. Batista had no inside information about the petroleum fields' unviability, and that he only sold shares that he was legally obliged to, since they had been pledged as collateral on a loan that came due.
His lawyers also note that he held on to more than 50 percent of the company's shares until the end and lost more than anyone else in the company's bankruptcy.
Amid the turmoil, Mr. Batista transferred ownership of multimillion-dollar homes in Rio de Janeiro and in a nearby beach resort to his wife and sons in what he has since said was routine estate planning.
If convicted, Mr. Batista could face up to 13 years in jail. But the country's record of prosecutions makes that outcome seem unlikely.
"In Brazil, if you can afford good lawyers, you can keep appealing forever, often on technicalities that serve no purpose other than to delay decisions," said Claudio Weber Abramo, executive director of Transparência Brasil, an anti-corruption group.
Mr. Batista's defense team on Thursday filed a motion arguing that the Rio de Janeiro federal court should not have jurisdiction and requesting that the hearing be postponed. The appeals court has not yet responded, so for now Mr. Batista's trial is still set to start Tuesday.
Even after a court issues a judgment, Brazilian law suspends the sentence while it is under appeal, and most cases can be appealed up to the Supreme Court, which has a lengthy backlog. As a result, even defendants who are convicted can often avoid serving their sentences until the statute of limitations releases them from judgment.
But Mr. Batista's case is coming in a harsher environment. The involvement of multiple prosecutors' offices, as well as advocacy groups representing creditors and small investors, are novelties in financial crimes investigations in Brazil.
Even if Mr. Batista is convicted, the case may not indicate a broader shift in the justice system.
"If this were not a person with Mr. Batista's exposure in the media, it's possible that there wouldn't have been a criminal case at all, just a civil one," said Gilberto Braga, a finance professor at the Ibmec-Rio business school. "In white collar crime," he added, "the prison sentence is hardly ever for more than a few years, and that can be converted into community service."

Full text:   THE Democrats' drubbing in the midterm elections was unfortunate on many levels, but particularly because the prospect of addressing income inequality grows dimmer, even as the problem worsens.
To only modest notice, during the campaign the Federal Reserve put forth more sobering news about income inequality: Inflation-adjusted earnings of the bottom 90 percent of Americans fell between 2010 and 2013, with those near the bottom dropping the most. Meanwhile, incomes in the top decile rose.
Perhaps income disparity resonated so little with politicians because we are inured to a new Gilded Age.
But we shouldn't be. Nor should we be inattentive to the often ignored role that government plays in determining income distribution in each country.
Here's what's rarely reported:
Before the impact of tax and spending policies is taken into account, income inequality in the United States is no worse than in most developed countries and is even a bit below levels in Britain and, by some measures, Germany.
However, once the effect of government programs is included in the calculations, the United States emerges on top of the inequality heap.
That's because our taxes, while progressive, are low by international standards and our social welfare programs -- ranging from unemployment benefits to disability insurance to retirement payments -- are consequently less generous.
Conservatives may bemoan the size of our government; in reality, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, total tax revenues in the United States this year will be smaller on a relative basis than those of any other member country.
And income taxes for the highest-earning Americans have fallen sharply, contributing meaningfully to the income inequality problem. In 1995, the 400 taxpayers with the biggest incomes paid an average of 30 percent in taxes; by 2009, the tax rate of those Americans had dropped to 20 percent.
Lower taxes means less for government to spend on programs to help those near the bottom. Social Security typically provides a retiree with about half of his working income; European countries often replace two-thirds of earnings.
Similarly, we spend less on early childhood education and care. And another big difference, of course, is the presence of national health insurance in most European countries.
All told, social spending in the United States is below the average of that of the wealthiest countries. And other governments help their less fortunate citizens to a greater extent than we do in ways that are not captured in the income statistics. The United States, which is the only developed country without a national paid parental leave policy, also has no mandated paid holidays or annual vacation; in Europe, workers are guaranteed at least 20 days and as many as 35 days of paid leave.
To his credit, President Obama has succeeded in keeping income disparities from growing even wider, by such measures as by forcing tax rates on the wealthiest Americans up toward fair levels.
Meanwhile, on the programmatic side, among the many meritorious aspects of the much-maligned Affordable Care Act are its redistributionist elements: higher taxes on investment income and some health care businesses are being used to provide low-cost or free health care to a projected 26 million Americans near the bottom of the income scale.
But much more can and should be done -- like raising the minimum wage nationwide and expanding the earned-income tax credit (a step supported by Republicans).
Helping those in the middle, whose incomes have been battered by globalization, will be harder and take longer. Expanded training programs and better education should be the centerpiece of any strategy to improve the lives of the middle class. A more robust economic recovery will also help the middle class, as will pro-growth policy initiatives like investment in infrastructure.
Critics from the right argue that doing more to level the income pyramid would hurt growth. In a recent paper, the International Monetary Fund dismissed that concern and suggested that a more equal distribution of income could instead raise the growth rate because of the added access to education, health care and other opportunities.
While some believe that the recent elections will stimulate both parties to make progress on the mound of challenges, in my view, that's a bit of a fantasy. But we can't stop talking about the problem of inequality, because then there really would be no hope.

Defying Expectations, Japan's Economy Falls Into Recession

Full text:   TOKYO -- Japan's economy unexpectedly fell into recession in the third quarter, a painful slump that called into question efforts by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to pull the country out of nearly two decades of deflation.
The second consecutive quarterly decline in gross domestic product could upend Japan's political landscape. Mr. Abe is considering dissolving Parliament and calling fresh elections, people close to him say, and Monday's economic report is seen as critical to his decision, which is widely expected to come this week.
Rising sales taxes have been blamed for triggering the downturn by deterring consumer spending, and with Japan having now slipped into a technical recession, the chances that Mr. Abe will seek a new mandate from voters to alter the government's tax program appear to have increased significantly.
The preliminary economic report, issued by the Cabinet Office, showed that gross domestic product fell at an annualized pace of 1.6 percent in the quarter through September. That added to the previous quarter's much larger decline, which the government now puts at 7.3 percent, a slightly worse figure than in its last estimate of 7.1 percent.
The surprise recession underscores the difficulties faced by Mr. Abe, who won power two years ago on a pledge to reinvigorate the economy and end his country's long streak of wage and consumer-price declines. His agenda, dubbed Abenomics, has focused largely on stimulus measures, in particular an expanded program of government bond purchases by the central bank. Yet its impact, economists say, has been dulled by the tax increase, which was approved under a previous government.
The tax plan was intended to curb Japan's immense government debt, which at about two and a half years' national economic output is the largest in the developed world. But there are concerns that after years of sluggish wage growth, consumer confidence is still too weak handle the increase. Instead of solving the debt problem, heavier taxes could simply push the economy back into a downward slide.
"Raising the consumption tax is supposed to increase government revenues, but if we fall back into deflation it will all be for nothing," Mr. Abe said at a meeting of Group of 20 leaders in Brisbane, Australia, on Sunday.
Akira Amari, Mr. Abe's economy minister, said after the economic report on Monday that rising taxes were having "a larger impact than expected, given that Japan's deflationary mind-set has not yet been cleared away."
The still half-completed sales-tax increase, a heated political issue in Japan, has also become a target of concern for leaders in the United States. Last week Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew urged Japanese and European policy makers to do more to stimulate their economies.
"If things are really bad in Europe and Japan, if there's a real slowdown in China, that's a headwind in the United States that we don't need," Mr. Lew said.
Japan's economy was already clearly struggling to shake off the effects of the first stage in the planned two-step tax increase, which was implemented in April. After the sharp slowdown in the second quarter, institutions, including the International Monetary Fund and the Bank of Japan, cut their estimates for economic growth this year and next. The central bank, its goal of reaching 2 percent stable inflation looking increasingly out of reach, was prompted late last month to expand its bond-buying program further.
Even so, the data reported on Monday confounded analysts' forecasts, which were mostly more optimistic. Economists surveyed by news agencies and research groups had been forecasting annual growth of slightly more than 2 percent on average. The report showed weakness in many important areas of the economy. Consumer spending barely picked up from its depressed level after the first tax increase in April, while indicators of housing and business investment declined.
Companies also reduced inventories of finished goods more aggressively than anticipated. That hurt growth but could help the economy rebound later on, since businesses would have to produce more to meet any increase in demand.
The Nikkei 225 stock average fell about 3 percent and the yen weakened against the dollar.
Although the second part of the tax increase would not be carried out until October, Mr. Abe needs to decide what to do about it soon, to give Parliament time to change legislation if he opts to cancel or postpone it. If fully enacted, the plan would increase the tax on all goods and services sold in the country to 10 percent over 18 months. It now stands at 8 percent after the first increase in April.
Mr. Abe has not said how much the economy would have needed to grow to give him the confidence to raise taxes again, but one of his economic advisers, Etsuro Honda, has argued that the minimum number needed to be close to 4 percent -- higher even than the forecasts and far better than the surprising negative result.
Abenomics is now in a particularly delicate phase. Consumer prices are rising, if not yet as strongly as hoped, as are corporate profits and the value of assets like stocks and property. But so far not much of the new wealth has reached average workers. Incomes have fallen behind the rising cost of living, in effect making people poorer. Another of Mr. Abe's advisers, Kozo Yamamoto, a lawmaker in his ruling Liberal Democratic Party, says the second tax increase needs to be put off "until wages catch up" to prices.
Mr. Abe and his inner circle appear to have interpreted the economy's struggles as signaling the need for an even bolder, purer stimulus program. Instead of encouraging economic activity through central bank money printing, on the one hand, while constraining it with higher consumer taxes on the other, he seems poised to twist the policy dial fully toward stimulus.
Many of his critics, however, would like to see him act more assertively in other areas, like loosening business regulations, that they think will have more lasting benefits for the economy.
"The numbers are much worse than expected," Yukio Edano, secretary general of the opposition Democratic Party of Japan, said. "The boom and bust in demand around the consumption tax hike show the limits of Abenomics."
Mr. Abe does not technically need to call an election to modify the tax plan, because his party is in firm control of both houses of the national legislature, the Diet. Even the existing tax legislation gives him some scope for review if he judges that the economy is struggling, and with a parliamentary majority the L.D.P. and its smaller coalition partner, New Komeito, could rewrite the law as they wanted.
Experts said Mr. Abe might wish to seek a broader mandate for such a controversial issue, however.
"The cabinet will rationally dissolve the Lower House with an aim to seek the public support for the postponement," analysts at Credit Suisse wrote in a note to clients. "PM Abe may decide on dissolving the Lower House by the end of this week." The Yomiuri newspaper said an announcement could come on Tuesday.
Parliament's current term lasts until mid-2016, making any election a year and a half sooner than legally necessary. Some political commentators have suggested the tax issue is a convenient pretext for Mr. Abe to seek a fresh term while he has political advantage on his side. Opposition parties are weak and disorganized, and although his once-sky-high poll ratings have slipped, he remains relatively popular, with public support of around 50 percent.

Abstract: Lower oil prices in particular will provide a much needed stimulus to consumers, particularly lower-income Americans who spend a larger percentage of their incomes on fuel; analysts say cheaper fuel has helped raise retail sales in the United States.

Full text:   For many consumers and businesses the recent drop in commodity prices has provided a tidy windfall -- one analyst estimated that the typical American household would save $400 a year thanks to lower gasoline prices. But the tumbling price of fuels, metals and other commodities is also sending a warning about the global economy.
Over all, commodity prices have fallen nearly 15 percent since late June, according to a Bloomberg index. Last week, the price of crude oil dropped to a four-year low, about $74 a barrel, down from about $107 a barrel in June. The prices of metals like copper, platinum and silver have also fallen sharply since the summer.
The decline can partly be explained by economic changes taking place in China. In the last two decades, the country has been gobbling up the world's coal, iron ore, copper, oil and other commodities to build new cities and fuel its booming economy, which grew at an average pace of nearly 10 percent a year for three decades. But that growth rate has now slowed, and with it China's demand for raw materials. This year, the country will grow at 7.4 percent, according to the International Monetary Fund.
The world had anticipated China's economic transition, but it was much less prepared for stagnation in Japan and in much of Europe.
In Japan, a sharp increase in a sales tax earlier this year has hurt consumer spending. And Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has largely failed to boost business investment and draw more women into the labor force, two changes he had promised as part of a plan to revive his country's weakened economy. The Bank of Japan recently expanded its bond-buying program, but bigger government policy changes will be needed to revive Japan's economy in 2015.
In Europe, government officials and central bankers in the 18-country eurozone have been slow and timid in boosting their economies, even though inflation is less than 0.5 percent and the unemployment rate is more than 11 percent. The European Central Bank should be buying government bonds to pump more money into the economy, a policy known as quantitative easing. But it has been reluctant to do so because German officials are opposed to the policy, which they think would serve to transfer wealth from strong euro nations to weaker ones. It should come as no surprise that the eurozone grew at just 0.2 percent in the third quarter of this year, according to data released on Friday.
The big losers in all this are nations that depend on commodity exports, like Russia, Brazil and Iran. Some of these countries, particularly Russia and Iran, already have substantial economic problems because of Western sanctions and government mismanagement. Brazil's economy was slowing before the decline in commodity prices, and it faces a difficult 2015. President Dilma Rousseff, who recently was re-elected by a narrow margin, needs to diversify Brazil's economy by investing in infrastructure and making it easier for entrepreneurs to start businesses.
The drop in prices, however, has been good for the United States, which is growing faster than other industrialized economies. Lower oil prices in particular will provide a much needed stimulus to consumers, particularly lower-income Americans who spend a larger percentage of their incomes on fuel; analysts say cheaper fuel has helped raise retail sales in the United States.
But America's economy could struggle in the coming year if Europe and Japan slip into another recession. About 25 percent of all American exports went to those two markets in the first nine months of the year.
The economic recovery from the financial crisis was uneven and disappointing. Now, in many countries, it is stalling.

Full text:   PARIS -- The European economy is barely managing to pull out of a rut, raising concern among global policy makers that continued sluggishness in the eurozone's richest countries may begin to ripple beyond the Continent's borders and pose risks to the recovery in the United States.
The 18-nation euro economy grew 0.6 percent in the third quarter on an annualized basis, Europe's statistics agency said Friday, well below its precrisis growth rate of around 2 percent. The big drags were the eurozone's largest economies, as a slowdown in Germany, a weak recovery in France and a triple-dip recession in Italy weighed on the region.
In a surprising role reversal, countries that were hardest hit by Europe's debt crisis have started to rebound faster than the biggest economies, especially Greece, which grew the fastest of any eurozone country and officially exited a wrenching six-year recession. Ireland and Spain, which had struggled to recover from major housing busts, also performed well.
Still, it was hardly a relief. Nor was it enough to offset the slowing of Europe's core economies, or to reverse the stark reality of high unemployment, sluggish job creation and ultralow inflation that have become embedded across large parts of the region.
"What's of concern to people when they look at Europe is that the weakness is now coming from the big three countries," said Mohamed A. El-Erian, chief economic adviser at the German insurer Allianz, referring to France, Germany and Italy. "It's no longer a story about the periphery; the core is now weakening."
The failure to generate a European revival six years after the global financial crisis broke out has stoked alarm elsewhere, including Washington, where there are concerns about collateral damage to the American recovery.
In a speech this week before a Group of 20 economic summit meeting -- which is to start Saturday in Brisbane, Australia, and where leaders including President Obama and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany will gather -- Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew bluntly criticized Europe's handling of the crisis.
"Status quo policies in Europe have not achieved our common G-20 objective of strong, sustainable and balanced growth," Mr. Lew told the World Affairs Council in Seattle. "Resolute action by national authorities and other European bodies is needed to reduce the risk that the region could fall into a deeper slump."
"The world cannot afford a European lost decade," he added.
Concerns about the Continent have also been building in Britain, which this week lowered its growth and inflation forecasts. Mark Carney, the Bank of England governor, warned on Wednesday that moribund growth in Europe could menace Britain's fledgling economic recovery. "A specter is now haunting Europe -- the specter of economic stagnation," he said.
The comments reflected growing frustration that leaders in Europe, the world's second-largest economic bloc, were not moving urgently to stoke a recovery after a crippling downturn that critics say has been made worse by austerity policies.
With a lack of ideas in eurozone capitals for jump-starting growth, the European Central Bank has been taking what Mr. Lew called "forceful steps" to support the European economy through low interest rates and private-sector bond purchases, similar to some of the weapons the Federal Reserve has deployed in the United States. But "this alone has not proven sufficient to restore healthy growth," Mr. Lew said.
Fears of stagnation may ratchet up pressure on Mario Draghi, the European Central Bank president, to do more. But this week, Mr. Draghi essentially said the bank did not have the power to propel a recovery on its own. In a speech in Rome, he warned that European growth would not pick up unless banks started lending more and governments encouraged investment, improved national competitiveness and took steps to lower unemployment.
Support by the central bank has become more urgent amid signs that ultralow inflation is settling in across the eurozone. Lowflation, as some economists call it, makes it harder for households and governments to pay off debts, and it could further crimp Europe's recovery prospects.
On Thursday, a European Central Bank survey showed that inflation would remain at worrisomely low levels before picking up slightly next year. The annual inflation rate in the eurozone was near a five-year low of 0.4 percent in October, and the central bank now expects a rate of 0.5 percent for 2014 -- well below the target of close to 2 percent.
The gloomy outlook has been mitigated by signs of better performance in the countries on the periphery of the eurozone.
Greece, which became the epicenter of the euro crisis in 2010, grew 0.7 percent on a quarter-over-quarter basis, the fastest pace in more than six years. "Greece is back," Prime Minister Antonis Samaras declared Friday. He has overseen a steady recovery and a marked improvement in the nation's fiscal performance after two multibillion-euro international bailouts. This year, he led Greece's return to borrowing in financial markets.
Still, Greeks are grappling with more than 25 percent unemployment, and a wrenching austerity program has compromised Mr. Samaras's popularity before a crucial election in February that could destabilize his government.
The Spanish economy, which was in recession a year ago, grew 0.5 percent on a quarterly basis from 0.6 percent between April and June. Ireland, which has not yet calculated third-quarter economic figures, grew by 1.5 percent in the second quarter, down from a 2.8 percent pace in the first quarter but still much better than the contraction it experienced at the end of last year.
In France, where a languishing economy has pushed President François Hollande's political popularity to new lows and propelled gains for the far-right National Front party, growth expanded in the third quarter for the first time this year, by 0.3 percent, after contracting in the second quarter and failing to grow at all in the first. But the French finance minister, Michel Sapin, acknowledged that the increase was "too small for the job creation necessary for our country."
Italy, for its part, slid into yet another recession despite pledges from Prime Minister Matteo Renzi to eschew austerity and turn the economy around. Growth shrank 0.1 percent in the third quarter from the second, when the economy contracted 0.2 percent.
Germany has been the biggest concern. The German economy, typically an engine of growth, only narrowly escaped recession, expanding 0.1 percent from the previous quarter, when output contracted by a revised 0.1 percent.
"Germany's virtuous circle is coming to an end," Carsten Brzeski, an analyst at ING Bank, said in a note to clients. He said it was "the first time the German economy underperformed the rest of the eurozone in two consecutive quarters since the doomy days of the crisis." These days, he added, Germany is more of "a one-eyed king in the land of the blind than an economic superman."
Economists say the region is flirting with entering a triple-dip recession, especially if national governments do not move quickly to create growth and jobs, like making hiring conditions easier for businesses and investing in major public works projects.
Unemployment in the euro area is stuck near a record high of 11.3 percent -- in contrast to the jobless rate in the United States, which has fallen to 5.8 percent from 10 percent at the height of the crisis.
As if that were not enough, Europe's recovery could be further menaced by renewed tensions between Russia and Ukraine, should a conflict lead to a new round of sanctions by Western countries and retaliatory sanctions by Moscow toward Europe.
"We are at most one or two rounds of sanctions and countersanctions away from pushing Russia into a deep recession, and Europe into a recession," Mr. El-Erian of Allianz said.

Abstract: The market was still panicking months after the government and the Federal Reserve had lowered interest rates to zero, engaged in extraordinary lending facilities, infused billions in equity in all the top banks, taken over the American International Group and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and allowed the two top investment banks, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, to tap the Federal Reserve lending window. Investors started to bid up the prices of things. Because of this, the big banks really did get healthier.\n

Full text:   The anger of the investing class has curdled into paranoia.
Paul Singer, the head of the $25 billion hedge fund Elliott Management, had an Edvard Munch moment in his most recent letter to his investors. "Nobody can predict how long governments can get away with fake growth, fake money, fake jobs, fake financial stability, fake inflation numbers and fake income growth," he wrote. Some commenters think the economy is improving, but he wrote, "We do not think this optimism is warranted, and we think a lot of the data is cooked or misleading."
This is only the latest howl about incipient inflation from the hedge fund manager crowd over the last several years. These inflation truthers have come in for consistent mockery, and deservedly so. They have aligned with conservative economists to attack the Federal Reserve and warn that its loose monetary policies are debasing the dollar and spurring sure-to-come, any-day-now runaway inflation. As The Washington Post's Matt O'Brien noted, Mr. Singer made a classic, and in this case pretty hilarious, mistake of generalizing from his own experience. "Check out London, Manhattan, Aspen and East Hampton real estate prices, as well as high-end art prices, to see what the leading edge of hyperinflation could look like," Mr. Singer wrote.
When zillionaires spend their millions on balloon dogs, they may be suckers, but it's not a harbinger of Zimbabwe.
If anything, we have dangerously too little inflation. And the government isn't "cooking" the data. As Floyd Norris pointed out last week in The New York Times, the incentives simply don't work that way.
Still, I come not to bury the wealthy investors, but to try to clarify what I think might be informing their perspective.
There really is a lot that seems "fake" about the economy and the markets. The paranoia is rooted in troubling episodes.
The other explanations come up short. Sure, they are angry that President Obama said mean things about fat cats. But it's not simply political. Mr. Singer is a well-known giver to Republicans (he also supports the marriage equality movement), but not all of these investors are conservatives. Perhaps it is a class fealty. Inflation is bad for holders of capital, after all. But Fed policies have been good for the wealthy.
These hedge fund managers came of professional age during two gigantic bubbles, mass delusions that went on for years. Take the stock market bubble. Recall that it was in 1996, when Alan Greenspan, then the Federal Reserve chairman, gave his famous irrational exuberance speech. The market didn't begin to crater until 2000. Then, within the living memory of every market participant, investors inflated yet another bubble -- a credit bubble that touched almost every asset and corner of the world. That, too, was identifiable years before it blew up.
So these hedge fund managers -- and the rest of the world of sentient markets observers -- have spent the formative periods of their professional lives watching the madness of crowds, enabled by central banks.
In response to perceived and real threats to the markets and the economy, the Fed spent its time either ignoring it or overreacting to minor blips. During the Greenspan era, the Federal Reserve repeatedly displayed unseemly concern for the health of the stock market. It was so strong that after 1987, the Fed flooded the market with cash. In 1998, the Fed engineered the rescue of Long-Term Capital Management. The Fed also loosened the monetary gates ahead of the Year 2000 bug, the Kim Kardashian of economic problems.
Then came the 2008 crash and a series of government-orchestrated moves that relied on collective suspension of disbelief. Take the 2009 stress test of the country's largest financial companies. It was a policy miracle, the crowning achievement of the rescue from the crisis. The market was still panicking months after the government and the Federal Reserve had lowered interest rates to zero, engaged in extraordinary lending facilities, infused billions in equity in all the top banks, taken over the American International Group and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and allowed the two top investment banks, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, to tap the Federal Reserve lending window.
Anyone who understood the banks -- and all top hedge fund managers did -- realized that if the banks were really forced to assess their solvency based on where assets were trading at that moment, they would have been insolvent.
But after the stress tests, the government pronounced the banks O.K. (with a promise to backstop them if they couldn't raise private capital). It was simply a collective exercise in looking the other way. Then, weirdly, it worked. The markets stabilized. Investors started to bid up the prices of things. Because of this, the big banks really did get healthier. Delusions and confidence games can have real-world effects.
Since then, the markets have been on a tear. But companies haven't been investing and wages are stagnant. Instead, corporations have spent the postcrisis years engaged largely in financial engineering. The largest United States corporations took 91 percent of their earnings from 2003 to 2013 and plowed them into buying back their own stock or paying out dividends, according to William Lazonick, an economist at the University of Massachusetts Lowell.
There has been a corporate shift from making investments for the long-term health of the company and the economy toward cutting jobs and elevating share prices, with the end result of increasing top executives' compensation, Professor Lazonick says. Nobody can say how long this can go on. But it's not sustainable.
At the risk of sounding like a Singerite, doesn't it sound just a bit -- what's the word? -- fake? Just because you are paranoid, doesn't mean the capital markets aren't out to get you.

Abstract: [...]public colleges' average published prices rose just 1 percent, after inflation, in each of the last two years, according to a report from the College Board based on surveys of colleges.

Full text:   After years of steep increases in college prices and student debt, turning both into major economic and public policy concerns, the real costs of college and student borrowing have leveled off, according to three studies being released on Thursday.
The authors said they could not tell whether the changes marked the start of a shift toward better news on the economics of higher education or just a temporary pause in more worrisome trends. And they cautioned that costs and debt remained near their all-time peaks, dauntingly high for many students, and would for the foreseeable future.
At four-year state colleges, declining state aid contributed to tuition doubling between 2001 and 2013, to an average approaching $9,000 for in-state students. But those schools have come under tremendous political pressure to limit price increases, leading to tuition freezes in places like the University of California and the University of Texas, and states have restored some of the support they cut during the severe recession that began at the end of 2008.
As a result, public colleges' average published prices rose just 1 percent, after inflation, in each of the last two years, according to a report from the College Board based on surveys of colleges. Those "sticker prices" tend to dominate perceptions and the debate over college costs, but they do not reflect factors like the discounts colleges give, in the form of financial aid.
Average net prices -- what people really pay, after accounting for grants from colleges and the government -- at four-year public colleges actually dropped in 2013-14, the College Board found, and are expected to rise slightly this year. The report projects net tuition and fees of about $3,000 this year, down about 4 percent, after inflation, from two years ago; with room and board, the average net price is expected to top $12,800, up just 1 percent from two years ago.
Community college net prices have been dropping for several years. At private nonprofit colleges, despite fast-rising sticker prices, average net prices, adjusted for inflation, have held relatively steady for a dozen years. This year, they are projected at more than $12,000 for tuition and fees, and more than $23,000 with room and board.
"It's significant that for a couple of years now, we're more or less flat, but we should not breathe too big a sigh of relief," said Sandy Baum, a co-author of the report, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute and a research professor at the George Washington University Graduate School of Human Development. "The next time the economy crashes, we may see another decline in state support for public institutions, and rising net prices."
The picture on student debt is less clear because of gaps in the available information, but after climbing sharply over a decade, both the percentage of students borrowing to pay for college, and the amount they borrowed, seem to have reached a plateau, according to two new studies, from the Institute for College Access and Success, a nonprofit advocacy group, and the College Board. Both groups analyzed a survey of colleges, and the institute, known as Ticas, combined that with the results of a separate survey of graduates; they reached similar conclusions about students who earned bachelor's degrees in 2013.
The institute reported that 69 percent of those graduates had student debt, compared with 68 percent the year before, while the College Board reported that the figure was static, at 60 percent. The institute put the average debt for those borrowers at $28,400, all but unchanged after inflation, and the College Board estimated it at $27,300, up about 1 percent, inflation-adjusted.
The estimates give an incomplete picture, because for-profit colleges, where students borrow more, often do not participate in the surveys, and the figures exclude dropouts. "There's a lot we don't know about what's driving it, and we really need better data," said Lauren Asher, president of Ticas. "It may be that families have more resources than they did a couple of years ago, so some of them are borrowing less," adding, "Affordability is no less a concern now than it was last year or the year before."
Analyzing data from lenders, primarily the federal government, the College Board reported that the amount borrowed each year by the average student had dropped slightly since 2011. Total undergraduate borrowing, the board concluded, was $71.4 billion last year, down 14 percent, after inflation, over three years. The decline was driven partly by falling enrollment, especially at for-profit colleges.

Full text:   Here's a story of utter irresponsibility: About one-third of American girls become pregnant as teenagers.
But it's not just a story of heedless girls and boys who don't take precautions. This is also a tale of national irresponsibility and political irresponsibility -- of us as a country failing our kids by refusing to invest in comprehensive sex education and birth control because we, too, don't plan ahead.
I kind of understand how a teenage couple stuffed with hormones and enveloped in each other's arms could get carried away. But I'm just bewildered that American politicians, stuffed with sanctimony and enveloped in self-righteousness, don't adequately invest at home or abroad in birth-control programs that would save the government money, chip away at poverty, reduce abortions and empower young people.
Neither Democrats nor Republicans seem particularly interested in these investments. The inflation-adjusted sum spent on Title X family planning in the United States has fallen by two-thirds since 1980.
A few depressing facts:
American teenagers become pregnant at a rate of about one a minute.
Some 82 percent of births to teenagers in the U.S. are unplanned.
American and European teenagers seem to be sexually active at roughly similar rates, although Americans may start a bit earlier. But the American teenage birthrate is three times Spain's rate, five times France's, and 15 times Switzerland's.
Young Americans show a lack of understanding of where babies come from. Among teenagers who unintentionally became pregnant, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the most cited reason for not using contraception was "I didn't think I could become pregnant." And 18 percent of young men somehow believed that having sex standing up helps prevent pregnancy, according to the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy.
Hello?
A teenager who has a baby often derails her own education and puts the child on a troubled trajectory as well. In Oklahoma last year, I met one family where the matriarch had a baby at 13, her daughter had a baby at 15, and that child, in turn, gave birth at 13. That's how poverty replicates.
Medicaid spends an average of $12,770 for a birth. Yet we spend only $8 per teenage girl on programs to avoid pregnancy. In financial terms, that's nuts. In human terms, it's a tragedy.
Internationally, we and other donor countries also underinvest in family planning in poor countries. Globally, 220 million women don't want to become pregnant but lack access to contraception.
Isabel Sawhill of the Brookings Institution has written an important new book, "Generation Unbound: Drifting Into Sex and Parenthood Without Marriage." She notes that most young single moms in America don't intend to become pregnant but drift into it fatalistically, partly because they rely solely on condoms or other less reliable forms of birth control.
Condoms are 82 percent effective in preventing pregnancy in any one year, according to the C.D.C. But that means that after four years of relying only on condoms, most women will have become pregnant at least once.
So Sawhill advocates a move to what she calls "childbearing by design, not by default." That means providing long-acting reversible contraceptives, or LARCs, to at-risk girls and young women who want them. LARCs are IUDs, or implants that can remain in place for years, and the failure rate is negligible.
Teenage birthrates in America have already dropped by more than half since 1991. But Sawhill calculates that if LARCs became much more widespread, the proportion of children born outside marriage could drop by a quarter, and the proportion of children who are poor would drop sharply as well.
"By turning drifters into planners, we would not only help those women achieve their own goals but also create much stronger starts for their children," Sawhill writes.
The American Academy of Pediatrics recently urged doctors to recommend LARCs for sexually active teenagers. One obstacle is the initial cost -- $500 to $1,000 -- so that many young people can't afford them.
A study in St. Louis offered free birth control, including LARCs, to sexually active teenagers and found that pregnancy rates for them plunged by more than three-quarters. Abortions fell by a similar rate. That's what we need nationwide.
The Affordable Care Act provides free access to all forms of contraception, which helps. But many pediatricians aren't trained in inserting LARCs.
So we need more women's health clinics, yet, instead, some are being closed as casualties of abortion wars. Moreover, states and schools should embrace comprehensive sex education, teaching contraception, the benefits of delaying sex and, also, the responsibility of boys.
A starting point for the United States should be to rebuild Title X spending on family planning. Surely we can afford to spend as much in this area as we did back in 1980.
So, of course, let's ask teenagers to show responsibility toward sex. But let's demand the same of our politicians.

Full text:   A quiz: How does the Democratic Party plan to lift stagnant middle-class incomes?
I realize that liberal-leaning economists can give a long, substantive answer to this question, touching on health care costs, education and infrastructure. But most Americans would not be able to give a clear answer -- which helps explain why the party took such a drubbing last week.
The Democratic Party's short-term plan to help the middle class just isn't very clear. Some of the policies that Democrats favor, such as broader access to good education, take years to pay off. Others, like reducing medical costs or building new roads, have an indirect, unnoticed effect on middle-class incomes.
The fact remains that incomes for most Americans aren't growing very fast and haven't been for years. Median inflation-adjusted income last year was still $2,100 lower than when President Obama took office in 2009 -- and $3,600 lower than when President George W. Bush took office in 2001. That's not just because of the financial crisis, either: Last month was another solid one for job growth and another weak one for average wage growth, the latest jobs report showed.
We're living through the great wage slowdown of the 21st century, and nothing presents a larger threat to the Democrats' electoral fortunes than that slowdown.
The Democratic Party fashions itself as the defender of working families, and low- and middle-income voters are indeed more favorably disposed to Democrats than to Republicans. Those voters have helped the party win the popular vote in five of the last six presidential elections. But if Democrats can't deliver rising living standards, many voters aren't going to remain loyal. They'll skip voting or give a chance to Republicans who offer an alternative, even a vague alternative.
As the 2016 presidential campaign begins to stir, the central question will be how both parties respond to the great wage slowdown. Neither has offered a persuasive answer so far -- let alone a solution -- which is why the public mood is so sour and American politics has been so tumultuous lately. The partisan makeup of the Senate has seesawed more over the past decade than in any time since just after World War II. The Republicans won big victories in 2004, 2010 and 2014, the Democrats in 2006, 2008 and 2012.
All the while, incomes keep stagnating, and nothing influences the national zeitgeist quite so much as income trends, for understandable reasons.
What can Washington do? The answers are very different for the short term and the long. Over years and decades, nothing matters more than economic growth. The last period of strong income gains -- the late 1990s -- was also the last period of strong economic growth.
Washington could definitely do more to help growth: better infrastructure, a less burdensome tax code, a less wasteful health care system, more bargaining power for workers and, above all, stronger schools and colleges, to lift the skills of the nation's work force. Countries that have made more educational progress over the last generation have experienced bigger income gains than the United States, and even here the pay gap between college graduates and everyone else has reached a record high.
Yet no mix of these policies is likely to end the great wage slowdown anytime soon. "This is not a silver-bullet issue," says Gene Sperling, a longtime adviser to Bill and Hillary Clinton and Mr. Obama, "and that's part of what's frustrating to people." In fact, the country is making good progress on several of these issues, starting with health costs, but incomes are still stuck.
Politicians often like to boast that they've come up with bold ideas to solve economic problems and then package those ideas as new -- a new deal, a new frontier, a new covenant. But most aren't really new. That's O.K., too. Truly new ideas don't come along very often in any field, including economics.
So it goes with lifting middle-class incomes. The best hope for doing so, in the immediate future, is probably the oldest and most obvious play in the book: a tax cut.
A few years ago, a middle-class tax cut would have seemed a silly idea. Both Mr. Bush and Mr. Obama had already cut taxes, and the federal budget deficit was enormous. But the deficit has since fallen sharply, thanks in part to lower health costs. Meanwhile, middle- and lower-income families are reaping a disproportionately small share of economic growth. Having the government try to rectify the situation doesn't sound so silly now -- and probably won't in the 2016 presidential campaign.
Obviously, a tax cut doesn't need to be a Democratic idea. If anything, it's traditionally been more of a Republican one. But Republicans' first priority tends to be cutting the top marginal tax rate or the corporate tax rate, changes that mostly benefit the affluent households already doing pretty well. (And history is clear that such tax cuts rarely bring the economic benefits their advocates claim.)
Any presidential candidate -- from either party -- who can claim the mantle of middle-class tax cutter is likely to benefit from it. For that matter, you could imagine Mr. Obama or reform-minded Republicans in Congress proposing such a tax cut sooner.
The details could be straightforward. The cut could be temporary or permanent. It could involve a decline in marginal tax rates for the middle class or an expansion of tax credits. Mr. Sperling, for example, has suggested giving middle-class and poor families some of the same tax incentives to save for retirement that wealthy people have. Any one of these plans would raise people's effective income in a tangible way.
Because the long-term budget deficit remains a problem, any such tax cut could be paired with a tax increase for top earners, who -- even after the expiration of some Bush-era tax cuts -- still face lower rates than they have for most of recent history. "Taxes for high-earning Americans are too low," argues Roger Altman, the Wall Street executive and Democratic adviser. Most Americans favor tax increases on the well-off, polls show.
The model for such a combination, and for winning the political debate over it, is Mr. Obama's 2008 presidential campaign. He proposed higher taxes on top earners along with a larger middle-class tax cut than Senator John McCain, his opponent, did. By the campaign's end, polls showed that many voters understood this fact -- and viewed the Democrats as the party of tax cuts.
A middle-class tax cut would not solve all of the country's economic problems. To be honest, it would worsen some of them -- particularly the widespread notion that my taxes are too high and your government benefits are too high. In truth, federal taxes are still low from a historical perspective.
But after 15 years of disappointing income growth, many voters are skeptical of sophisticated economic plans with uncertain, long-term payoffs. They're looking for simple ideas that can help people immediately. The popularity of minimum-wage increases makes the point: Even as Democrats were going down to defeat nationwide, voters in five states handily approved such increases.
The challenge for the next election will be coming up with a version of the minimum-wage increase that applies to the middle class as well.

Full text:   Nissan announced on Saturday that it was recalling more than 52,000 vehicles for airbags that could rupture during inflation, sending shards of metal into the passenger compartment.
The vehicles have airbag systems made by the Takata Corporation, a Japanese supplier. The Nissan vehicles are among nearly 14 million others made by 11 automakers recalled worldwide over the Takata airbags.
The recall affects the Infiniti FX35 and FX45 from the 2003 to 2005 model years, the Infiniti I35 from the 2003 and 2004 model years, and the Infiniti M35 and M45 from the 2006 model year. Also affected are Nissan Pathfinders from the 2003 and 2004 model years and Nissan Sentras from the 2004 to 2006 model years.
In all, 52,738 vehicles are involved.
The newly recalled vehicles were sold or registered in high-humidity regions of the United States. The humidity can cause the airbag propellant to burn too fast and blow apart the inflater's metal canister. The problem has been linked to four deaths.
Affected states include Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas. The recall also affects American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is investigating whether Takata and automakers that use its airbags acted quickly enough once the defects were suspected.
Nissan announced a small recall of two Infiniti models late last month, also tied to Takata-made airbags. That recall affected about 1,800 Infiniti QX56 sport utility vehicles from the 2013 model year and the Infiniti QX80 from the 2014 model year.
The Tokyo-based Nissan said it would notify owners and replace the airbag inflater free of charge.

Full text:   PARIS -- Janet L. Yellen, chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, on Friday praised a recent review of eurozone banks, saying it would help remove doubts about the integrity of the financial system.
Some analysts have questioned whether a health check of banks completed last month by the European Central Bank was rigorous enough, but speaking at a conference in Paris, Ms. Yellen appeared to disagree.
"The recent comprehensive assessment is an important step toward building confidence," Ms. Yellen said.
Ms. Yellen did not comment directly on the European Central Bank's signals on Thursday that it was edging closer to deploying the same stimulus strategy already used by the Fed in the United States, large-scale purchases of government bonds. She said only that central banks "need to use all available tools."
Ms. Yellen spoke at a symposium sponsored by the Bank of France, where prominent central bankers, economists and asset managers tried to come to grips with a financial world that functions in a much different way than before the crisis that began in 2008.
Other speakers included Haruhiko Kuroda, governor of the Bank of Japan; Laurence D. Fink, chief executive of the asset manager BlackRock; and Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England.
Ms. Yellen appeared on a panel that included Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund; and Raghuram Rajan, governor of the Reserve Bank of India.
While highly academic, the sessions highlighted how little consensus there is among the experts about issues like the optimal level of inflation, the risks that may lurk in a world where interest rates are close to zero, and what central banks should be doing to help growth and prevent future crises.
"Nothing works and we don't know why," said Jacob A. Frenkel, chairman of JPMorgan Chase International, attributing the sentiment to Albert Einstein.
The session came a day after the European Central Bank made its strongest commitment yet to pump money into the eurozone to prevent deflation, a destructive decline in prices. The central bank indicated it would aim to increase the total value of its balance sheet -- the sum of its gold, loans outstanding and other assets -- by 1 trillion euros.
Analysts say that commitment will eventually force the European Central Bank to buy government bonds on a large scale, as other central banks have done to stimulate their economies when official interest rates were as low as they could go.
While Ms. Yellen was restrained in her comments on European Central Bank policy, Ms. Lagarde repeated calls for it to do more. "All levers should be used and all available policies should be implemented," Ms. Lagarde said, in a clear reference to the bank.
Mohamed A. El-Erian, chief economic adviser at the German insurer Allianz, argued during a separate talk that the risk that stimulus measures would create inflation was not as great as the risk of doing nothing.
"The trade-off is not between doing something now and inflation down the road," Mr. El-Erian said. "The trade-off is between doing something now and taking a high risk of financial instability later."
William C. Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, spoke about whether central bankers from different countries should try to coordinate their policies. While formal coordination probably would not work, he said, the Fed considers the effect on the rest of the world when it sets policy.
"Our mandate has a domestic focus," he said. But added: "We are mindful of the global effects of Fed policy."

Full text:   THE government is growing. Finally.
Preliminary figures on the size of the United States economy indicate that in the first three quarters of 2014, the government grew at an annual rate of 1.8 percent, after adjusting for inflation.
That is hardly rapid growth, but it is nonetheless a milestone. Assuming that the government sector does not shrink significantly in the current quarter, this will be the first year since 2009 that real government gross domestic product has risen at all. The figures include spending by federal, state and local governments.
Government employment is also rising, albeit at a slow pace, but that is mainly because local governments are rehiring some workers laid off during the recession. Federal government employment has been basically static in recent months, and the October jobs figure was just 21,000, or 0.8 percent, lower than the year-earlier total.
A major reason for the government sector's shrinking after since 2009 was a retreat in investment spending by governments since the end of the stimulus program, which pumped money into road and school construction early in the Obama administration.
In each of the first three quarters of this year, government spending classified as investments amounted to 3.4 percent of G.D.P., as can be seen in the accompanying charts. Not since 1948 had there been a single quarter that low.
Federal government investment in nonmilitary programs -- on things like highways -- fell to a 54-year low in the third quarter, at 0.63 percent of G.D.P. Military investment -- on building weapon systems and military bases -- fell to a 13-year low of 0.81 percent. State and local government investment, on such things as schools and sewers, edged up in the third quarter, but at 1.94 percent, it is lower than in any quarter from 1984 to 2013.
Government consumption -- that is, operating expenses -- has fallen below 15 percent of the economy in three of the four most recent quarters. It had not been that low since 2002.
Given the economic slack in the construction sector, and the decaying infrastructure in much of America, many economists have called for an increase in spending on roads and sewers. But it has not happened. In a time of austerity, delaying or canceling investment projects may be much easier politically than laying off workers or otherwise reducing current operations.
The government G.D.P. figures include all the costs of operating government agencies, ranging from building schools and paying teachers to building bombs and rockets and regulating banks. They do not include government transfer payments in programs like Social Security, unemployment insurance and welfare benefits. Those payments are expected to rise during recessions, and they did.
Until the Great Recession, the only times that government investment spending declined in consecutive years, after adjustment for inflation, were in the early 1950s as the country demobilized after the Korean War, and in the late 1960s, as the Vietnam War spending on weapons began to decline. In the 1950s, however, the decline in military spending was largely offset by investment in civilian projects like highways and schools. In the late 1960s, there were also declines in investment in civilian programs, as the government struggled to avoid tax increases even as war spending remained high.

Full text:   Only days after many voters complained of worsening economic prospects, the new employment report from the government on Friday provided fresh evidence that the economy was actually getting better, with a sizable jump in the number of people saying they found a job last month.
The Labor Department estimated that employers added 214,000 jobs in October, and the official unemployment rate dropped to 5.8 percent, down sharply from 7.2 percent a year ago.
The increase in payrolls -- combined with a revision that added 31,000 jobs to previous reports from August and September -- put the average monthly job gain for the last six months at about 235,000. That pace, several analysts said, indicated that the economy was gathering momentum.
But the report also found that wages were rising only slightly faster than the rate of inflation, fueling the debate over just how strong the labor market really is. Over the last 12 months, wages are up just 2 percent, which helps explain much of the disconnect between increasingly cheery assessments from many economists and the public's continuing discontent.
"We are adding jobs, but it is still a wageless recovery," Elise Gould, an economist with the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, said, adding that average hourly earnings rose only 0.1 percent in October after no gain in September. "The economy may be growing, but not enough for workers to feel the effects in their paychecks."
Many economists nonetheless found plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the future.
The number of people walking away from the labor market has halted, while the average number of hours worked ticked up. And a survey of households, though generally considered less reliable than figures gathered from employers, found that more than 683,000 people had been hired into a new job last month. "Labor force participation actually rose" to 62.8 percent, said Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist at the Northern Trust Company, who noted that the drop in unemployment was not simply a result of people dropping out of the work force.
A broader measure of unemployment that includes discouraged job seekers or those stuck with only part-time work dropped to 11.5 percent, down more than 2 percentage points from the seasonally adjusted figure from a year ago.
The headway on jobs can be seen as validation of the Federal Reserve's decision to end its bond-buying campaign last month, while the lack of wage growth is likely to add caution to the Fed's considerations over when to raise interest rates next year.
"I'm not thinking we're behind the curve," Loretta J. Mester, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, told CNBC on Friday, meaning that the latest jobs numbers had not convinced her that the Fed should move more quickly.
Some analysts counseled patience on the wage front, predicting that the strengthening job market would soon translate into tangible increases.
"We think this is a very strong report," said Michael Gapen, an economist at Barclays. "We will see wage gains going forward. They just didn't show up in this report."
Paul Ashworth, an economist at Capital Economics, said the Labor Department's figures might not reveal all the progress that has been made. "The employment cost index is a much more comprehensive measure of wage growth, on which the Fed has traditionally put more weight," he noted, concluding that "it shows a very clear acceleration in wage growth" over the last six months. Perhaps, but as Labor Secretary Thomas E. Perez pointed out, what people care about is their weekly paycheck. "Wages are what matter to living standards," he said.
Mr. Perez noted that workers had benefited from few of the gains in productivity in recent decades. "Sweat equity isn't translating into financial equity, even while the C.E.O.s of those companies are reaping dramatic rewards," he said. "That's the angst and frustration that I see across this country."
While the recovery from the recession is in its sixth year, stagnant wages and the wide gap between the rewards for those at the top of the income ladder and for ordinary workers have left many people disenchanted with their economic prospects.
Election Day exit polls found that 78 percent of those surveyed were very or somewhat worried about the future of the economy, while two-thirds said they believed the economy was getting worse.
The lack of wage growth, particularly at the bottom, helps explain why ballot measures aimed at increasing the minimum wage in Alaska, Arkansas, Nebraska, Illinois and South Dakota all passed despite widespread losses in those states among Democrats who supported such measures.
"It may seem counterintuitive that wages and salaries are growing the slowest in industries where jobs are growing the fastest," LaVaughn M. Henry noted in an analysis from the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland's Cincinnati Branch, "but it actually is not." Because many of the new jobs in the leisure, hospitality and retail industries require little training or credentials, he explained, there is little pressure to raise wages.
Low-paying leisure and hospitality jobs accounted for nearly one in eight new jobs created in the past year, economists at IHS Global Insight noted, while many of the newly reported hires were teenagers. There were also racial disparities in the job gains, with whites experiencing an unemployment rate of 4.8 percent compared with 10.9 percent for blacks and 6.8 percent for Hispanics.
The persistent problem of long-term unemployment showed no signs of improvement this month, with 2.9 million people out of work for 27 weeks or more. This group accounts for about a third of those without jobs.
Even the gloomiest assessments, however, acknowledged that no matter how tepid one might think the recovery is, the United States is still far outpacing Europe. Six years after a debt crisis hit the continent, unemployment in the European Union has edged down only slightly to 11.5 percent from a peak of 12 percent last year. It is nowhere near returning to precrisis levels of around 7 percent.
There are other signs of the American economy's strength. Over the last 12 months, according to a report released on Wednesday, the number of bankruptcy cases filed in federal courts dropped 13 percent to 963,739, the lowest since the 2007 fiscal year. And consumers, encouraged by falling gasoline prices, are more upbeat about job prospects than at any time in the last six years.
Many of the strongest jobs gains were in service industries, created by small-business employers like Matthew Saravay, who runs Wizard Studios, a special-event production company in Brooklyn. "We've never been busier," Mr. Saravay said. "I have interviews lined up, trying to keep up with the clamor of opportunity. We're seeing holiday parties return in a way I haven't seen in seven or eight years."
Steve Roesner, president and chief operating officer of Quatro Composites in Iowa, which produces structures for manufacturers in the aerospace industry, said he hired 100 new workers this year, bringing the company's total staff to 220. He expects to further increase his work force by 20 percent next year. "In our industry, there's a lot of optimism," Mr. Roesner said.
Looking ahead, Tara M. Sinclair, an economist at Indeed.com, one of the nation's largest sites for job postings, said she had noticed particularly strong growth in the retail and transportation sectors. "It definitely looks like things are slowly moving in the right direction," she said.

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDEDWhen the Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg gave the federal Centers for Disease Control foundation $25 million to help combat the Ebola crisis last month, it served as a public service announcement of sorts.
Five years after the recession reshaped the global economy, charitable giving is back in a big way in the United States. What is more, a new generation of donors is meeting significant challenges with transformative gifts.
Mr. Zuckerberg has emerged as one of the most generous entrepreneurs of his generation, doling out eight- and nine-figure gifts to education, health and community development causes. And to a surprising degree, much of the country has followed in Mr. Zuckerberg's footsteps, even after the financial crisis.
Overall charitable giving in 2013 was up 3 percent from the previous year, the largest year-over-year increase since the recession, according to Giving USA and the Indiana University Lilly Family School of Philanthropy, which track contributions. Donations from individuals, companies, foundations and bequests topped $335 billion in 2013, approaching the peak from before the financial crisis. It was the fourth consecutive year of gains.
And while few are as wealthy as Facebook or its founder, the American people and the business community have largely shrugged off the financial crisis and resumed their charitable ways.
"It's really recovered," said Melissa Berman, chief executive of Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors. "America has a long, long tradition of generosity."
It wasn't always clear this would be the case. In the throes of the recession, giving plunged 15 percent, to $298 billion in 2009 from $350 billion in 2007, according to the Giving USA data, which is figured in constant, inflation-adjusted dollars.
Even then there was a silver lining. The country was poorer, meaning there was less to give, yet as a proportion of wealth generated, Americans appeared to maintain their generosity.
"Although total giving has predictably declined, we are still giving at high levels and at nearly the same proportion of total dollars as before," wrote Rob Reich and Christopher Wimer of Stanford University, in a 2012 paper examining the recession's impact on philanthropy.
But where those dollars were going "changed pretty significantly," said Eileen R. Heisman, chief executive of the National Philanthropic Trust. Donations to organizations that fight homelessness and food banks spiked in 2008 and 2009, while giving to arts and education causes slumped.
"When there's a recession and high unemployment, people respond to those immediate needs," said Ms. Berman.
But as the direst days of the recession have passed, giving to different causes has returned to precrisis levels. "As the recovery has persisted, people are moving back to the areas where they have traditionally given," said Dr. Patrick M. Rooney, associate dean of Indiana University Lilly Family School of Philanthropy.
Giving to the arts and education has outpaced charity to hunger and homelessness causes in recent years. And when disasters strike, be it an earthquake in Haiti or a tsunami in Japan, Americans can generally be relied on to open their wallets.
Perhaps most surprising about giving since the recession is who has proved most generous. It turns out that poorer individuals give a greater percentage of their income, even during tough times. Though low-income Americans cut back on charitable giving the most during the recession, they tend to give a higher proportion of their wealth away than those in the middle and upper classes.
"It's remarkable how generous low-income Americans are," said Ms. Berman. "Their giving dropped the most in the recession because they don't have as much expendable income, but they tend to give a higher proportion of their money away to charity.
"Folks that see so clearly how their lives can be upended by one thing -- a child that gets sick or a family member having a hard time -- have a sense of, 'There but for the grace of God go I.' "
The richest individuals have also resumed their charitable ways. "More high-net-worth households are giving, and they're giving more," said Mr. Rooney.
In recent months, a number of large gifts from billionaires have made headlines. In addition to Mr. Zuckerberg's donation to fight Ebola, last month Charles T. Munger, the vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, gave $65 million to the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics at the University of California, Santa Barbara. And last year, the billionaire real estate developer Stephen Ross gave $200 million to the University of Michigan.
Today's youth, enabled by online giving and best exemplified by Mr. Zuckerberg, are also participating. "The millennials are really committed to giving," said Ms. Heisman. "This isn't just a baby boomer phenomenon."
And companies, too, are gradually resuming their philanthropic initiatives, though progress is slow. Just 64 percent of companies increased total contributions from 2010 to 2013, according to a report by the CECP, in association with the Conference Board. And corporate giving, while up 10.8 percent since 2011, dropped 3.2 percent from 2012 to 2013, Giving USA says.
Yet despite this broad-based recovery in giving, the recession did set back philanthropy in America. The $335 billion in gifts last year remains below the precrisis high of $350 billion. "It's been a pretty slow build-back," said Ms. Heisman.
The biggest drag is individual giving, which is down $21 billion from before the recession began, according to Mr. Rooney. Efforts like Giving Tuesday, a charitable take on the likes of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, and new online sites like Donors Choose and Kickstarter, have failed to meaningfully bolster giving levels.
As a result, Americans still give away roughly 2 percent of the country's gross domestic product per year. That is higher than other countries and has largely recovered since the recession. But the proportion is not growing substantially.
"The 'glass half empty' view is that we're back to where we were about a decade ago," said Mr. Rooney. "The 'glass half full' is that giving dropped during the Great Recession, but it didn't fall off the charts. There's a reason they call it the Great Recession."
Correction: November 12, 2014, Wednesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Friday about an increase in charitable giving omitted a source for a report that found that just 64 percent of companies had increased their total philanthropic contributions from 2010 to 2013. The report was done by CECP, in association with the Conference Board -- not by the Conference Board alone.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Fewer people applied for unemployment benefits last week, adding to signs that the job market should continue to improve.
The Labor Department said on Thursday that weekly applications fell 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 278,000. The four-week average, a less volatile measure, declined 2,250, to 279,000, the lowest level in more than 14 years.
Applications are a proxy for layoffs, and they have retreated 18.5 percent in the last year, suggesting rising economic confidence among businesses.
Employers have added an average of 227,000 jobs a month in 2014 and added an average of 194,000 last year. Over the last 12 months, they have added 2.64 million jobs, the best showing since April 2006. The unemployment rate has fallen to 5.9 percent, a six-year low.
Economists predict that the Friday jobs report will show 230,000 new jobs in October. The unemployment rate is projected to hold steady.
In a separate report, the Labor Department said workers' productivity increased in the third quarter at a slower pace than in the previous quarter. Productivity, the amount of output per hour of work, rose at a 2 percent annual rate in the third quarter after a 2.9 percent gain in the second quarter.
Labor costs rose 0.3 percent in the third quarter after falling 0.5 percent in the second quarter.
The payroll processor ADP reported on Wednesday that companies in the United States added 230,000 jobs in October. The result was the highest in four months and a sign that businesses are still willing to hire despite signs of slowing growth overseas. Job gains above 200,000 are usually enough to lower the unemployment rate.
In addition to the relatively few applications for benefits, the ADP report and gains in manufacturing sentiment tracked by the Institute for Supply Management also indicate strong hiring last month.
"All of these point to a solid nonfarm payroll report for October," said Jennifer Lee, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets.
Still, the improvement in hiring has yet to translate into higher wages. Average wages have grown slightly faster than inflation. Median annual household income, at $54,045, remains 4.6 percent lower than incomes when the recession began in late 2007, according to Sentier Research.
The Federal Reserve keeps a close watch on productivity and labor costs for any signs that inflation may be accelerating. Greater productivity is an important factor in determining rising standards of living. It enables companies to pay their workers more without having to increase prices. Even with the small acceleration, labor costs remain far below levels that would raise concerns about inflation.
Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the main message from the report was that productivity is accelerating while labor costs remain under control.
He said the economy was seeing "a notable pickup in productivity growth."

Abstract: The parts of the nationalist agenda that Mr. Putin seeks to avoid include immigrant-bashing and calls for a more equitable distribution of wealth -- as during Communist times. The strategy of choosing part of the nationalist agenda seems to be working, with Mr. Putin still enjoying the robust poll numbers he gained after the annexation of Crimea in March.

Full text:   MOSCOW -- It is often difficult to untangle the welter of competing agendas among Russian nationalists, a cacophony of ideas that was on display on Tuesday in the central event of their year: the Russian March, held on Unity Day, which marks the battle in 1612 when Russians united to expel the Polish Army from Moscow.
Fervent supporters of the Kremlin's policy toward Ukraine marched in the lead of the column, while the rear was composed of activists horrified by what they described as a Russian assault against fellow Slavs in that country. Between them came monarchists, groups bellowing anti-immigrant chants, socialists, Russian Orthodox believers and even some hooded pagans.
Perhaps most noteworthy, however, was the number of those who chose not to be there at all. At most a few thousand attended the rally. Organizers had anticipated that it would draw 10,000.
There were several reasons for the relatively low turnout. The government marginalized the event by relegating it to a remote southeastern suburb. The Kremlin also honored the holiday by organizing its own rally, We Are One, in front of the Bolshoi Theater in central Moscow. It was led by the usual list of government stalwarts: fading crooners, Olympic athletes and a cosmonaut, among others.
But perhaps the main reason is that President Vladimir V. Putin has adopted some central tenets of the nationalist agenda, even as he presents himself as a bulwark against its more unsavory, even "dangerous," ideas.
Or as Andrei Sinitsyn, a columnist for the business daily Vedomosti, wrote on Wednesday, the nationalist agenda has been "nationalized." For years -- or at least the years when they were allowed to march through downtown Moscow -- nationalists of all stripes were considered by the government to be a useful way to head off the revolution that senior officials were convinced Western powers were constantly trying to hatch.
But there has always been a certain level of unease between Mr. Putin and the nationalists, not least because some are prone to participate in rare but explosive public protests against him.
"President Putin, as 'the main nationalist,' doesn't agree with such voices of the holiday," Mr. Sinitsyn wrote. "Nationalism should be returned to the government, and it will decide how to implement and celebrate national unity."
Mr. Sinitsyn was referring to remarks Mr. Putin made late last month at the annual gathering of international Russia experts known as the Valdai Discussion Club. "I am the biggest nationalist in Russia," Mr. Putin said. "However, the greatest and most appropriate kind of nationalism is when you act and conduct policies that will benefit the people."
Other strains of nationalism were unacceptable, he said. "If nationalism means intolerance of other people, chauvinism, this would destroy this country, which was initially formed as a multiethnic and multiconfessional state."
To put it more succinctly, Mr. Putin likes the kind of nationalism that allows him to annex Crimea from Ukraine ostensibly to protect ethnic Russians. He likes the kind of nationalism that spills over into foreign policy, as it has all year, in which he can tell the Western world that it has dismissed Russia for too long and that Moscow plans to reassert itself as a nuclear superpower.
Mr. Putin also endorses the kind of nationalism that reinforces traditional values. That was on display this week, too, when a statue honoring the former Apple chief executive Steven P. Jobs in the form of a six-foot iPhone was dismantled because Mr. Jobs's successor, Timothy D. Cook, came out as gay.
The parts of the nationalist agenda that Mr. Putin seeks to avoid include immigrant-bashing and calls for a more equitable distribution of wealth -- as during Communist times.
"There are different kinds of patriots," noted Tatiana Stanovaya, an expert on Russian domestic and foreign policy. Imperialists, for example, support the resurrection of the empire in all its multicultural glory, while hard-core nationalists push for the supremacy of only ethnic Russians.
The strategy of choosing part of the nationalist agenda seems to be working, with Mr. Putin still enjoying the robust poll numbers he gained after the annexation of Crimea in March.
Surveys indicate that fear of immigrants has waned slightly, while support for the Russian March dropped to 31 percent this year from 40 percent last year, according to a poll by the Levada Center, a nongovernmental Russian research organization.
Part of Mr. Putin's nationalist agenda includes burnishing Russian history under the czars.
Toward that end, state-run television ran a new movie called "Sunstroke" by the director Nikita Mikhalkov during prime time on Tuesday. (A close ally of Mr. Putin, the main state-run news channel publicized the movie broadcast all day.)
The prerevolutionary scenes in the movie -- a love story set along the Volga River -- were filmed in vibrant colors, while the postrevolutionary scenes appeared uniformly gray.
"It was to manifest how Russia was once brilliant in the past and became bad in Soviet times," said Vladimir A. Ryzhkov, an opposition politician.
"It was the time of the czar, the church, the bureaucracy and high culture, a time when an autocratic, czarist regime brought stability," he said. "The ideology of this movie is promoting old Russia as an ideal for current Russia."
The problem for Mr. Putin at the moment, Mr. Ryzhkov and others noted, is fitting the Ukraine policy into that nationalistic ideal without provoking more Western economic sanctions.
The September agreement that brought a cease-fire and the outline of a potential peace deal to eastern Ukraine appears to be unraveling, not least because Russia supported elections last Sunday in the breakaway city-states of Donetsk and Luhansk that the Kiev government had declared illegal. Minor skirmishes also occur daily despite the cease-fire.
Many Russians, including much but not all of the nationalist camp, support the idea of extending diplomatic recognition to the two areas, which Mr. Putin called Novorossiya, or New Russia, after a czarist-era name for a larger region that included them.
Mr. Putin is under some public pressure to make the move. Gennady A. Zyuganov, head of the Communist Party and a deputy in Parliament, called for recognition during the official rally in front of the Bolshoi Theater.
Yet Mr. Putin knows that nationalism as foreign policy can go only so far. Russia is already suffering because of low oil prices and from sanctions that have restricted its access to financial markets, fueling inflation and leading to a more than 20 percent devaluation of the ruble since August.
Recognition of the separatist region would surely bring even harsher Western measures.
But the nationalist fervor he has stoked seems to urge him toward making that step. As one sign in the official march read, "The bear is the master of the taiga."
Said Ms. Stanovaya, "He is between two fires now."

Abstract: The gloomier outlook will most likely raise expectations for the European Central Bank to take additional steps to stimulate the economy, though economists said they did not expect policy makers to take action at a meeting on Thursday.

Full text:   BRUSSELS -- European Union officials on Tuesday sharply lowered growth forecasts as member states like France, Germany and Italy showed weak economic performance, and as business confidence suffered from heightened geopolitical risks.
Growth is expected to be a meager 1.3 percent in the 28-member bloc this year, instead of the 1.6 percent predicted in the spring, said the European Commission, the union's executive arm. And the economy is not expected to get much better in 2015, when growth in Germany, the region's economic engine, is expected to grind down to about 1 percent.
"The economic and employment situation is not improving fast enough," Jyrki Katainen, the European Commission vice president for jobs and growth, said in a statement accompanying the closely watched economic forecast.
Unless there are additional signs of growth and job creation in the next five years, "people could despair of the European project," Pierre Moscovici, the European commissioner for economic and monetary affairs, said at a news conference on Tuesday.
The recovery on the Continent continues to lag those in the United States and Britain. Over the next two years, annual growth in Britain is expected to be close to 3 percent, and the unemployment rate is projected to be 5.5 percent in 2016, according to the data released Tuesday. The unemployment rate in the European Union is not expected to fall below double digits, where it has been since 2012, until 2016.
The gloomier outlook will most likely raise expectations for the European Central Bank to take additional steps to stimulate the economy, though economists said they did not expect policy makers to take action at a meeting on Thursday.
The report on Tuesday did not take into account how the European economy might get a boost from a 300 billion euro, or $375 billion, plan to invest public and private money into infrastructure projects. Jean-Claude Juncker, who took office this month as president of the European Commission, has pledged to present that package before the end of the year.
But how much of an effect that would have on lackluster growth remains to be seen. The spending program is unlikely to "change the whole world," Mr. Katainen said, but "its contribution can be significant."
The lower forecasts, especially in the 18-nation euro area, where the commission cut its projection for growth this year to 0.8 percent from an earlier 1.2 percent, are a measure of how quickly optimism about a recovery has dissipated. France has failed to grow as hoped, and Italy struggles to make overhauls. There are also signs that the German economy is stalling.
In one of the more drastic downgrades for 2015, the commission lowered Germany's forecast for growth by nearly a full percentage point to 1.1 percent.
Among the problems facing European economies like Germany is the prospect of a "new cycle of sanctions and countersanctions" related to the restrictions that the United States and the European Union imposed on Russia in retaliation for its role in the Ukraine crisis, and reciprocal moves by Moscow, European Union officials said.
Those tensions "could pose a larger roadblock to European growth prospects than currently envisaged in the forecast," the officials said in a report accompanying the forecasts.
The tensions might also "have triggered a wait-and-see attitude among firms," the officials wrote in a section of the report that focused on Germany.
Germany is expected to post growth of 1.3 percent this year, down from an earlier forecast of 1.8 percent. The French economy is expected to grow 0.3 percent this year, down from an earlier estimate of 1 percent.
Italy appeared to stand out as a poor performer: Its economy was predicted to shrink 0.4 percent this year compared with a forecast in May for growth of 0.6 percent.
The commission also expressed concerns about inflation, which it said would remain very low this year and would not come close to the target of just under 2 percent anytime soon. It projected an annual inflation rate of 1.6 percent in the European Union in 2016.
"With confidence indicators declining since midyear and now back to where they were at the end of 2013, and hard data pointing to very weak activity for the rest of the year, it is becoming harder to see the dent in the recovery as the result of temporary factors only," officials wrote in their report.
The commission said it expected growth rates to improve somewhat in 2015, rising to 1.5 percent in the European Union and to 1.1 percent in the eurozone.
Even so, weaker-than-expected growth this year is likely to make it much harder for countries like France and Italy to achieve the bloc's mandated targets to keep budget deficits and government debt in check.
France and Italy could face disciplinary action and steep fines if they fail to show that they are making sufficient effort to bring their economies in line with European budgetary rules. Mr. Katainen said those recommendations would be published by the end of this month.
Over all, the commission said, the most recent figures indicate a slow fading of the legacy of the sovereign debt crisis, with many member states still weighed down by high unemployment, high debt and low output.
That prompted Mr. Katainen, the commission vice president, to call on member states to agree on the [euro]300 billion spending plan to bolster demand.
"Accelerating investment is the linchpin of economic recovery," he said.
Germany also "can play a significant role stimulating the euro area and E.U. economy" by saving less and spending more, Mr. Katainen said.

Full text:   TOKYO -- The Bank of Japan, this country's equivalent of the Federal Reserve, has lately been making a big effort to end deflation, which has afflicted Japan's economy for almost two decades. At first its efforts -- which involve printing a lot of money and, even more important, trying to assure investors that it will keep printing money until inflation reaches 2 percent -- seemed to be going well. But more recently the economy has lost momentum, and last week the bank announced new, even more aggressive monetary measures.
I am, as you might guess, very much in favor of this move, although I worry that the policy might nonetheless fail thanks to fiscal mistakes. (More about that later.) While the bank did the right thing, however, it did so amid substantial internal dissent. In fact, the new stimulus was approved by only five of the bank board's nine members, with those closest to business voting against. Which brings me to the subject of this column: the economic wisdom, or lack thereof, of business leaders.
Some of the people I've spoken to here argue that the opposition of many Japanese business leaders to the Bank of Japan's actions shows that it's on the wrong track. In saying this, they're echoing a common sentiment in many countries, including America -- the belief that if you want to fix an ailing economy, you should turn to people who have been successful in business, like leaders of major corporations, entrepreneurs and wealthy investors. After all, doesn't their success with money mean that they know how the economy really works?
Actually, no. In fact, business leaders often give remarkably bad economic advice, especially in troubled times. And I think it's important to understand why.
About that bad advice: Think of the hugely wealthy money managers who warned Ben Bernanke that the Fed's efforts to boost the economy risked "currency debasement"; think of the many corporate chieftains who solemnly declared that budget deficits were the biggest threat facing America, and that fixing the debt would cause growth to soar. In Japan, business leaders played an important role in the fiscal mistakes that have undermined recent policy success, calling for a tax hike that caused growth to stall earlier this year, and a second tax hike next year that would be an even worse error.
And on the other side, the past few years have seen repeated vindication for policy makers who have never met a payroll, but do know a lot about economic theory and history. The Federal Reserve and the Bank of England have navigated their way through a once-in-three-generations economic crisis under the leadership of former college professors -- Ben Bernanke, Janet Yellen and Mervyn King -- who, among other things, had the courage to defy all those tycoons demanding that they stop printing money. The European Central Bank brought the euro back from the brink of collapse under the leadership of Mario Draghi, who spent the bulk of his career in academia and public service.
Obviously there are business leaders who have gotten the economic analysis right, and plenty of academics who have gotten it wrong. (Don't get me started.) But success in business does not seem to convey any special insight into economic policy. Why?
The answer, to quote the title of a paper I published many years ago, is that a country is not a company. National economic policy, even in small countries, needs to take into account kinds of feedback that rarely matter in business life. For example, even the biggest corporations sell only a small fraction of what they make to their own workers, whereas even very small countries mostly sell goods and services to themselves.
So think of what happens when a successful businessperson looks at a troubled economy and tries to apply the lessons of business experience. He or (rarely) she sees the troubled economy as something like a troubled company, which needs to cut costs and become competitive. To create jobs, the businessperson thinks, wages must come down, expenses must be reduced; in general, belts must be tightened. And surely gimmicks like deficit spending or printing more money can't solve what must be a fundamental problem.
In reality, however, cutting wages and spending in a depressed economy just aggravates the real problem, which is inadequate demand. Deficit spending and aggressive money-printing, on the other hand, can help a lot.
But how can this kind of logic be sold to business leaders, especially when it comes from pointy-headed academic types? The fate of the world economy may hinge on the answer.
Here in Japan, the fight against deflation is all too likely to fail if conventional notions of prudence prevail. But can unconventionality triumph over the instincts of business leaders? Stay tuned.

Abstract: Analysts and investors will be looking to see whether Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, and his colleagues will take a more aggressive approach when they meet next week, perhaps moving toward putting into effect a policy of broad-based quantitative easing, in which the central bank engages in large-scale buying of government bonds.

Full text:   PARIS -- Price pressures in the eurozone remain dangerously weak, official data showed on Friday, while a separate report showed continuing stagnation in the labor market.
Consumer prices rose at an annual rate of 0.4 percent in the 18 nations that share the euro currency, Eurostat, the statistical agency of the European Union, reported in a first estimate of October inflation from Luxembourg.
That was marginally up from the 0.3 percent recorded in September, but far below the level of just under 2 percent aimed at by the European Central Bank.
The latest data add to the pressure on the central bank to take additional steps to stimulate the economy, particularly now that the distractions of reviewing the eurozone's biggest banks are behind it.
The central bank this week disclosed its first purchases in a planned campaign to buy private sector assets. But the amount bought -- 1.7 billion euros', or $2.15 billion, worth -- was considered minimal by analysts and propelled speculation that the central bank would soon be forced to take larger steps to bolster its balance sheet.
Analysts and investors will be looking to see whether Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, and his colleagues will take a more aggressive approach when they meet next week, perhaps moving toward putting into effect a policy of broad-based quantitative easing, in which the central bank engages in large-scale buying of government bonds.
In Russia, the central bank sought to defend the faltering ruble on Friday by raising its key interest rate 1.5 points, to 9.5 percent. Sanctions on Russian businesses imposed by the European Union and the United States in reaction to the Ukraine crisis have caused inflation in Russia to rise and sent the ruble to its lowest levels ever.
In Europe, energy prices, down 1.8 percent from September, dragged the overall inflation rate lower. The so-called core inflation rate, which excludes energy, food, alcohol and tobacco, came in at 0.7 percent, down from 0.8 percent in September.
The eurozone's September jobless rate was unchanged from August at 11.5 percent, Eurostat said in a separate announcement.
For the overall European Union of 28 countries, the jobless rate was 10.1 percent, also unchanged from August. Across Europe, about 24.5 million people were unemployed in August, including nearly five million youths, out of a working-age population of about 243 million people.
Both the inflation and the labor market numbers were in line with market expectations. A struggling labor market and weak price pressures are symptoms of the same problem: insufficient demand.
Businesses are not investing and hiring fast enough to restore growth because prospects remain uncertain, at best, and households are keeping a tight handle on spending for the same reason.
Most economists believe that the eurozone economy contracted or stagnated in the three months from July through September, and the latest data will not change many opinions.
On Nov. 14, Eurostat will announce figures for third-quarter economic growth, which was flat in the eurozone in the second quarter. The United States economy expanded at a 3.5 percent annual rate in the third quarter, the Commerce Department reported on Thursday.
Fear of falling prices is not limited to Europe. Officials in Japan, China and the United States are all closely watching the trend.
This week, concerns about deflation led the Swedish central bank, the Riksbank, to cut its main interest rate target to zero from 0.25 percent. The Federal Reserve in Washington, which on Wednesday announced an end to its large-scale bond-buying program, said its main rate target would also remain near zero "for a considerable time."
And on Friday, the Bank of Japan surprised the markets with the announcement of another round of bond-buying to bolster the money supply and put an end to persistent declines in consumer prices.
Still, "it is clearly not impossible," the Goldman Sachs economists wrote, adding: "There is (and always has been) a point at which the macro data are bad enough to trigger sovereign Q.E.," especially if the long-term outlook for inflation moves lower.
"Should the outlook deteriorate enough to trigger sovereign Q.E.," they said, "the E.C.B. is likely to implement it aggressively. By contrast with some E.C.B. initiatives in the past, we would not expect a halfhearted or limited introduction of government debt purchases."
