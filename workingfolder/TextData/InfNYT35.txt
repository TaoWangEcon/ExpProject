Full text: WASHINGTON -- Though it reached no agreement, the special Congressional committee on deficit reduction built a case for major structural changes in Medicare that would limit the government's open-ended financial commitment to the program, lawmakers and health policy experts say.
Members of both parties told the panel that Medicare should offer a fixed amount of money to each beneficiary to buy coverage from competing private plans, whose costs and benefits would be tightly regulated by the government.
Republicans have long been enamored of that idea. In the last few weeks, two of the Republican candidates for president, Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich, have endorsed variations of it.
The idea faces opposition from many Democrats, who say it would shift costs to beneficiaries and eliminate the guarantee of affordable health insurance for older Americans. But some Democrats say that -- if carefully designed, with enough protections for beneficiaries -- it might work.
The idea is sometimes known as premium support, because Medicare would subsidize premiums charged by private insurers that care for beneficiaries under contract with the government.
"This is an idea that could easily resurface in the future as Congress seeks additional Medicare savings for deficit reduction," said Patricia H. Neuman, senior vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation.
Even though the deficit committee failed, its work may frame the debate over Medicare, taxes and other issues in the 2012 election year and beyond.
John C. Rother, president of the National Coalition on Health Care, which represents consumers, employers and providers, said, "The supercommittee may have laid the groundwork for future reductions in the growth of Medicare."
Representative Jeb Hensarling of Texas, the ranking Republican on the committee, frequently quoted a statement by President Obama: "The major driver of our long-term liabilities, everybody here knows, is Medicare and Medicaid and our health care spending. Nothing comes close."
Medicare is likely to remain at the center of the nation's long-term debt crisis through 2030, when more than 80 million people will be on Medicare, according to federal estimates.
Alice M. Rivlin, who was budget director for President Bill Clinton, had urged the deficit panel to establish an insurance exchange for Medicare beneficiaries. Private plans would compete with the traditional Medicare program and would have to provide at least the same benefits. The federal contribution in each region would be based on the cost of the second-cheapest option, whether that was a private plan or traditional Medicare.
Mr. Obama's health care law provides "premium support" for people below age 65. The government will offer subsidies, in the form of tax credits, to help people buy coverage marketed by private carriers on an insurance exchange.
If this approach works for commercial insurance under the new law, it could allay concerns about similar changes to Medicare.
Competition among private insurers has already driven down costs for prescription drug coverage under Medicare. Medicare's drug benefit is delivered entirely by private insurers. In addition, one-fourth of the 48 million Medicare beneficiaries are in private Medicare Advantage plans, offered by companies like UnitedHealth and Humana, which cover a wide range of doctors' services and hospital care.
The new health care law is cutting payments to Medicare Advantage plans. Republican lawmakers predicted that the cuts would lead insurers to increase premiums, reduce benefits or pull out of the program. But so far the dire predictions have not been borne out.
On average, the Obama administration said recently, Medicare Advantage premiums will be 4 percent lower in 2012 than in 2011, and insurers expect their Medicare enrollment to increase by 10 percent.
Throughout the deficit reduction talks, Democrats insisted that any package be balanced. They entertained the idea of restructuring Medicare as part of a large deficit reduction package that also included tax increases. They repeatedly described the budget as a moral document and said they would not balance the budget on the backs of older Americans, children and poor people.
Democrats gave no indication that they would accept major Medicare changes in the absence of tax increases.
But other ways of reining in Medicare costs carry their own political risks. Mr. Obama discussed one such proposal -- gradually increasing the age of eligibility for Medicare -- as part of a budget deal that he tried to negotiate over the summer with Speaker John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio.
Mr. Obama is counting on a new agency, the Independent Payment Advisory Board, to ensure a sharp reduction in the growth of Medicare spending per beneficiary. But he has not nominated anyone to run the agency, which Republicans denounce as a tool for rationing care.
Democrats sharply criticized the budget blueprint approved in April by the House, under which new beneficiaries would receive a fixed amount of money from Medicare to help pay premiums for private insurance policies.
A report on that proposal by the Congressional Budget Office provided ammunition to its critics. "Under the proposal," the report says, "most elderly people would pay more for their health care than they would pay under the current Medicare system," and some would choose not to buy coverage, so "the number of older Americans without health insurance would be higher."
Health policy experts said these problems resulted from specific features of the House Republican plan and were not necessarily inherent in the idea of "premium support." Medicare, they said, could move toward "premium support" without destroying the individual entitlement at the heart of the program.
The House Republicans' budget plan would eventually eliminate traditional Medicare as an option for new beneficiaries. Ms. Rivlin would keep it as an option, competing directly with private insurers.
Under the House Republican plan, the federal contribution would be increased each year to reflect the age of a beneficiary and general inflation, measured by the Consumer Price Index. But health costs and insurance premiums have been rising faster than consumer prices in general, so the federal contribution was almost guaranteed to fall behind the cost of insurance.
As an alternative, the federal contribution could be set at a percentage of the premium charged by a private plan, or the lowest-cost plans, or it could reflect the average premium for all plans in an area. Beneficiaries could keep some or all of the difference if they chose a plan costing less than the federal payment, and they would have to pay more if they chose a more expensive plan.
Because the deficit reduction panel failed to reach agreement, the government is supposed to make across-the-board cuts in spending, starting in 2013. The new budget law says that Medicare payments to doctors, hospitals and health plans cannot be reduced more than 2 percent in any year.
The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the automatic cuts will trim $123 billion from Medicare over 10 years. But since the cost of the program is still expected to total more than $7 trillion in those years, lawmakers are likely to continue the frantic search for savings.

Full text: "We are the 99 percent" is a great slogan. It correctly defines the issue as being the middle class versus the elite (as opposed to the middle class versus the poor). And it also gets past the common but wrong establishment notion that rising inequality is mainly about the well educated doing better than the less educated; the big winners in this new Gilded Age have been a handful of very wealthy people, not college graduates in general.
If anything, however, the 99 percent slogan aims too low. A large fraction of the top 1 percent's gains have actually gone to an even smaller group, the top 0.1 percent -- the richest one-thousandth of the population.
And while Democrats, by and large, want that super-elite to make at least some contribution to long-term deficit reduction, Republicans want to cut the super-elite's taxes even as they slash Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid in the name of fiscal discipline.
Before I get to those policy disputes, here are a few numbers.
The recent Congressional Budget Office report on inequality didn't look inside the top 1 percent, but an earlier report, which only went up to 2005, did. According to that report, between 1979 and 2005 the inflation-adjusted, after-tax income of Americans in the middle of the income distribution rose 21 percent. The equivalent number for the richest 0.1 percent rose 400 percent.
For the most part, these huge gains reflected a dramatic rise in the super-elite's share of pretax income. But there were also large tax cuts favoring the wealthy. In particular, taxes on capital gains are much lower than they were in 1979 -- and the richest one-thousandth of Americans account for half of all income from capital gains.
Given this history, why do Republicans advocate further tax cuts for the very rich even as they warn about deficits and demand drastic cuts in social insurance programs?
Well, aside from shouts of "class warfare!" whenever such questions are raised, the usual answer is that the super-elite are "job creators" -- that is, that they make a special contribution to the economy. So what you need to know is that this is bad economics. In fact, it would be bad economics even if America had the idealized, perfect market economy of conservative fantasies.
After all, in an idealized market economy each worker would be paid exactly what he or she contributes to the economy by choosing to work, no more and no less. And this would be equally true for workers making $30,000 a year and executives making $30 million a year. There would be no reason to consider the contributions of the $30 million folks as deserving of special treatment.
But, you say, the rich pay taxes! Indeed, they do. And they could -- and should, from the point of view of the 99.9 percent -- be paying substantially more in taxes, not offered even more tax breaks, despite the alleged budget crisis, because of the wonderful things they supposedly do.
Still, don't some of the very rich get that way by producing innovations that are worth far more to the world than the income they receive? Sure, but if you look at who really makes up the 0.1 percent, it's hard to avoid the conclusion that, by and large, the members of the super-elite are overpaid, not underpaid, for what they do.
For who are the 0.1 percent? Very few of them are Steve Jobs-type innovators; most of them are corporate bigwigs and financial wheeler-dealers. One recent analysis found that 43 percent of the super-elite are executives at nonfinancial companies, 18 percent are in finance and another 12 percent are lawyers or in real estate. And these are not, to put it mildly, professions in which there is a clear relationship between someone's income and his economic contribution.
Executive pay, which has skyrocketed over the past generation, is famously set by boards of directors appointed by the very people whose pay they determine; poorly performing C.E.O.'s still get lavish paychecks, and even failed and fired executives often receive millions as they go out the door.
Meanwhile, the economic crisis showed that much of the apparent value created by modern finance was a mirage. As the Bank of England's director for financial stability recently put it, seemingly high returns before the crisis simply reflected increased risk-taking -- risk that was mostly borne not by the wheeler-dealers themselves but either by naive investors or by taxpayers, who ended up holding the bag when it all went wrong. And as he waspishly noted, "If risk-making were a value-adding activity, Russian roulette players would contribute disproportionately to global welfare."
So should the 99.9 percent hate the 0.1 percent? No, not at all. But they should ignore all the propaganda about "job creators" and demand that the super-elite pay substantially more in taxes.

In a Nervous Market, Gold Finds New Fans

Abstract: "The money supply will be expanded in the major currencies in the developed world, and investors will seek the protection of hard assets: something real, and gold is perceived as real," Mr. Wien said by telephone. What makes the situation particularly complicated today is that the easiest vehicle for average investors who want to hold gold are gold exchange-traded funds.

Full text: Byron Wien, the investment strategist, has been forecasting the future for decades. But this is the first year that he has officially recommended gold in his model portfolio.
And at the beginning of this month, Mr. Wien, vice chairman of Blackstone Advisory Partners, said he was maintaining his 5 percent allocation to gold for next year.
The metal has become the insurance policy of choice for many sophisticated investors. Even among those who were never gold bugs, there is now a belief that it has its place in a portfolio.
Mr. Wien's view comes despite the fact that gold, which was up 29.5 percent in 2010, was up an additional 20.7 percent at the end of October of this year, according to Mr. Wien's most recent report -- nearly double the increase for real estate, the second-highest increase among Mr. Wien's recommended asset classes.
His decision to continue recommending gold comes even while some investors feel that after such a steep run, prices may fall. The returns reflect the hard reality that as governments print money, thereby debasing the value of their currencies, gold still looks like a sensible option.
"The money supply will be expanded in the major currencies in the developed world, and investors will seek the protection of hard assets: something real, and gold is perceived as real," Mr. Wien said by telephone.
Is he expecting gold to continue its astonishing ascent? There are reasons to doubt that it will. For example, the dollar has rallied as fears of problems in the euro zone have grown. Often that increase forecasts a drop in gold value, since deterioration in currency values suggests higher gold prices.
That does not change Mr. Wien's view. "You don't buy insurance because you think you will have a fire or a flood," he said. "You buy it and you hope you don't collect on it."
Even the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, has been watching the price of gold as an index of investor confidence in the future. "I think the reason people hold gold is as a protection against what we call 'tail risk' -- really, really bad outcomes," Mr. Bernanke said at a hearing in July before the U.S. Congress. "To the extent that the last few years have made people more worried abut the potential of a major crisis, then they have gold as a protection."
Sounds logical, right? And yet gold is a controversial investment.
"Gold is even more speculative than real estate," said Fran Kinniry, a principal in Vanguard's Investment Strategy Group. "At least with housing, you have the income from rents. With gold there is no income at all. Gold does not pay dividends or interest, so the only thing you get is the price differential. It has benefited from many months of flight-to-safety flows that can crash at any moment.
"The fundamental underpinnings are so shaky that I have no confidence whatsoever that any so-called relationship between the price of gold and anything else is a stable relationship," Mr. Kinniry said.
Even so, as the Italian and Greek governments fail to resolve their problems, gold looks particularly attractive because, with the dollar, it is considered a safe harbor in times of such uncertainty.
"Gold is a money that governments don't print," said Charles Stevenson, a private investor who first bought gold during the inflation of the 1970s and continues to own gold today, although he has traded in and out along the way.
"It's a way to hold value when there is nothing to invest in because it stores value the way money is supposed to, " he said. "If you hold your assets in money, inflation now exceeds interest rates, and the government is draining purchasing power."
The situation is sufficiently volatile that Gary Brinson, a veteran strategist and scholar who runs the Brinson Foundation, agrees that gold, even at its currently high price, may have a small place as insurance.
"You can get into windows of time where gold will act as a counterweight in an otherwise asset-based portfolio," he said. "The problem is that if you pay too much for it, its ability to offset the inflationary effect is diminished."
As recently as a month ago, gold fell drastically, surprising and worrying investors. "There are caveats," Mr. Stevenson said. "In a bad world, gold won't necessarily maintain its value. If real estate drops in half and gold drops a quarter, for example, you can sell gold and buy twice as much real estate."
What makes the situation particularly complicated today is that the easiest vehicle for average investors who want to hold gold are gold exchange-traded funds. They are volatile because you can buy them on margin, and that attracts speculative buyers.
There are wild cards, too. People who need money sell the assets that can be sold. "If you invested in John Corzine's MF Global and you needed to sell those assets, you couldn't do it," Mr. Stevenson said. "There is always a bidder for gold, just like there are always bidders for top-quality real estate, but there might not be bidders for B-quality real estate."
Certainly there were historical periods when gold was a bad bet. It was a disappointing holding between 1980 and 2000, when other assets were growing in value. As interest rates declined, any company in which one invested could refinance, making it a benign environment to use cash for other investments.
But James Grant, who has a newsletter, remains bullish despite the hiccups because he believes that the "central banks -- north, south east and west -- have gotten out of the central banking business and into the central planning business, meaning that they are devoted to raising up: if they can; economic growth and employment through the dubious means of suppressing interest rates and printing money. The nice thing about gold is that you can't print it."
Having said that, Mr. Grant acknowledges that when gold fell 50 percent in 2008, 'it certainly tested confidence," he said. But he simply does not believe that, for now, bankers can see into the future and improve things.

Abstract: Within the last few weeks, however, cracks have emerged in the region's mighty economies, and analysts and policy makers have become more concerned about the painful disruption that could spill into Asia as the situation in Europe continues to deteriorate and the United States' growth remains subdued. With interest rates already at rock bottom, the government has resorted to direct intervention in the currency markets -- selling yen for dollars -- four times in little more than a year in its effort to weaken the yen.

Full text: HONG KONG -- Asia's ability to stay resilient amid the West's economic troubles is slowly waning.
For much of this year, the economies of the Asia-Pacific region appeared to be blissfully isolated from the turmoil in other parts of the world. Asian stock markets fell along with those in the rest of the world, but the region's economies continued to power ahead.
Within the last few weeks, however, cracks have emerged in the region's mighty economies, and analysts and policy makers have become more concerned about the painful disruption that could spill into Asia as the situation in Europe continues to deteriorate and the United States' growth remains subdued.
Exports from Asia have been softening for months as demand in Europe, in particular, has slowed. Although many countries depend less on exports than they once did, the sector remains crucial for economies like those of Taiwan and South Korea and for the small, open economies of Hong Kong and Singapore, economists say.
"The potential risks for Asia have increased" as the European crisis has moved beyond small peripheral economies like Greece, enveloping larger countries like Italy, Spain and even France, said Frederic Neumann, co-head of Asian economic research at HSBC in Hong Kong.
The spreading economic troubles were underscored Wednesday when a closely watched gauge showed Chinese manufacturing contracting. The reading, published by HSBC, dropped from 51 in October to 48 in November, the lowest level in nearly three years and much lower than economists had expected. A reading of 50 is the line between expansion and contraction.
The decline fanned worries about the spillover of the West's problems into Asia. But it also reinforced nervousness about the effect in the opposite direction: the West increasingly needs a strong Asia to buy its goods as consumers elsewhere stay on the sidelines.
"Europe is now where the United States was three years ago: The economic contraction is only just beginning," said Pranay Gupta, chief investment officer for the Asia-Pacific region at ING Investment Management in Hong Kong.
So far, the economic pain in Asia has been relatively muted, and much of the region remains on course for strong growth.
The Chinese economy is set to expand 9.5 percent this year, according to projections from the International Monetary Fund in September. India is expected to grow 7.8 percent, Indonesia 6.4 percent, and many other Southeast Asian nations more than 5 percent, the I.M.F. estimates.
Those figures, however, are generally below the growth rates seen in 2010, and are likely to ease off further next year, the I.M.F. and most economists say.
Reacting to the worsening global environment, Indonesia and Australia have lowered interest rates in recent weeks. Most other central banks in the region have put off rate increases that seemed likely only months ago fears about growth replace inflation concerns.
In Japan, the pain has been compounded by the results of the devastating earthquake and tsunami in March and by the persistent strength of the yen. Fanned by the economic difficulties in other parts of the world, the currency's rise has made Japanese goods more expensive for shoppers abroad and has helped dent exporters' profits.
With interest rates already at rock bottom, the government has resorted to direct intervention in the currency markets -- selling yen for dollars -- four times in little more than a year in its effort to weaken the yen.
In the financial sector, meanwhile, banks like HSBC, UBS and Nomura are cutting jobs around the globe. And although many banks would like to grow in the Asia-Pacific region, financial centers like Hong Kong and Singapore have not escaped the hiring freezes and job cuts.
"There are still pockets of hiring in the Asian financial sector, but it has got a lot tougher in recent months," said Matthew Bennett, managing director at the recruitment firm Robert Walters in Hong Kong.
With the crisis in the euro zone spilling into ever-bigger economies, the worry now is that the ripples into Asia could grow. Analysts have begun to fret that beleaguered European banks could sharply scale back their lending to Asia and other emerging markets as they adjust to tighter capital rules that are to be introduced next year.
Overall bank lending remained stable through the first half of 2011, the World Bank wrote in a report on the economies of East Asia, released Tuesday. Any sudden shutdown in credit markets, of the sort that happened after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, would have painful repercussions for Asia.
In the six months after that crisis, the World Bank said in its report, international banks reduced their exposure to companies in developing East Asian countries by $36 billion.
"Asia's financial systems overall have sufficient liquidity to finance more growth and could step into the breach. But if European banks were to withdraw lending from the region, that would be highly disruptive, as it would take some adjustment time before lending shortfalls are bridged," said Mr. Neumann of HSBC, adding that growth in Asia had also become more dependent on credit in recent years.
The ability of companies to raise cash via the capital markets has already been crimped.
Asian stock markets have largely shrugged off the region's favorable economic fundamentals this year and have fallen sharply. The key indexes in Hong Kong, India and Taiwan are all down about 20 percent since the start of this year; that is more or less in line with the Euro Stoxx 50's performance.
Proceeds from stock market debuts in the Asia-Pacific region have likewise tumbled, to about $74 billion so far this year, compared with nearly $159 billion during the same period last year, according to data from Reuters.
Despite all that, however, many economists and investment strategists say they believe that the region as a whole remains relatively well positioned.
Hiring outside the financial sector -- especially in retail, consumer goods and hospitality -- remains dynamic, headhunters like Mr. Bennett report.
Unemployment rates across the region are far below those in the West (3.3 percent in Hong Kong, for example; 3.1 percent in South Korea; 5.2 percent in Australia -- compared with 9 percent in the United States and 10.2 percent in the euro zone), so consumers remain willing to spend.
Rising affluence also has turned populous nations like China, India and Indonesia into major markets for goods, helping to make up for some of the demand drop-off from Europe and the United States.
Moreover, most Asian economies, with the exception of Japan, do not have sovereign debt like that weighing on Europe and the United States. For example, the yield on 10-year bonds issued by Indonesia is now below those of Spain and Italy, a previously almost inconceivable situation that shows how confidence levels have shifted.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- A day after the United States imposed fresh sanctions on Iran over its nuclear program, President Obama's national security adviser argued Tuesday that the administration's pressure campaign had left Iran's leaders economically strained, diplomatically isolated and rent by internal divisions.
The official, Thomas E. Donilon, predicted that the next blow to Iran would come with the fall of its major regional ally, President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, who is himself increasingly isolated as he battles a popular uprising.
"Having actively funded the regime's brutality and the killing of its own people, Iran will be discredited in the eyes of the Syrian people and any future government," Mr. Donilon said in a closely monitored speech at the Brookings Institution. "Iran's isolation from the Arab world will have deepened."
Noting that President Assad had been scorned by the Arab League and abandoned by Turkey's leader, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Mr. Donilon said the Syrian leader's time was running out. He even referred to Mr. Assad's administration as the "Assad group," which made it sound less like a government than a gang.
Since taking over as national security adviser 13 months ago, Mr. Donilon has emerged as one of the most influential foreign-policy voices in the administration. And with the departure next month of another senior adviser, Dennis B. Ross, Mr. Donilon is taking direct control of the delicate Iran portfolio.
Answering critics of the administration, he dismissed fears that the withdrawal of the last American troops from Iraq next month would open the door to rising Iranian influence. The Iraqi people, he said, hold deeply unfavorable impressions of Iran, even those who support political groups backed by Tehran.
"Iran has failed in its effort to shape Iraq into a client state in its own image," said Mr. Donilon, adding that the United States would maintain a "long-term strategic partnership" with Iraq after the troops leave.
Kenneth M. Pollack, director of the Saban Center for Middle East Policy at Brookings, said he did not dispute that characterization. But he added that if cornered, Iraq's Shiite population "will inevitably fall back on the Iranians, not because they like them, but because they have no one else to turn to."
On Monday, the United States and its allies announced coordinated sanctions that aimed to sever Iran's access to the international banking system, but that still fell short of a total cutoff. The United States imposed separate sanctions against Iran's petrochemical industry, and further measures against its oil industry.
The steps showed both the progress of the administration's efforts to rally global support and the hurdles still ahead. Russia and China have refused to impose additional measures, leaving the effort less a worldwide campaign than a Western one.
"They've been very good partners, frankly," Mr. Donilon said, when asked about the lack of unity, but he did not elaborate.
He also did not say whether he believed that Iran could be prevented from making a nuclear weapon, a goal the International Atomic Energy Agency said in a recent report the Iranians could be actively pursuing.
Still, in making the case for Mr. Obama's strategy, Mr. Donilon said that sanctions had slowed down Iran's progress. Citing the atomic energy agency's report, he said Iran currently had about 6,000 working centrifuges, which are used to enrich uranium to weapons grade, far fewer than the 50,000 centrifuges that the head of Iran's atomic energy organization predicted in 2007 that Tehran would have by 2011.
He cited the high cost and difficulty Iran had in obtaining equipment to run its uranium enrichment program, though he made no mention of covert efforts to sabotage the program, like the computer worm Stuxnet, a cyberattack that may have had the involvement of both the United States and Israel.
As for Iran's broader economy, Mr. Donilon said the sanctions had brought it to a virtual standstill, with an inflation rate of 20 percent, high unemployment and "negligible growth," despite high oil prices. The growing economic sway of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps is a further cause of frustration, he said.
Mr. Donilon pointed to growing fissures within the Iranian leadership, noting that the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad "seem increasingly headed toward a confrontation over the direction of the country." On Monday, a top adviser to Mr. Ahmadinejad was briefly arrested, in what appeared to be a sign of the mounting tensions.
Mr. Donilon made no mention of recent reports that Israel was considering a military strike on Iran's nuclear facilities -- something that has privately concerned officials. But he repeated the administration's position that the United States would take no options off the table in dealing with Tehran.
"Pressure is a means not an end, and our policy is firm," he said. "We are determined to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons."

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve is moving toward providing more information on its goals and expectations as a way of helping investors predict the direction of its policies, according to the minutes of the November meeting of its policy-making committee.
The central bank intends to focus on improving communication, which it believes could amplify the effect of its existing policies, before considering new steps to foster growth, according to the account of the meeting, which the Fed published Tuesday after a standard delay.
While the economy remains weak and more than 25 million Americans cannot find full-time work, the Fed has taken only small steps to stimulate the economy since June. And the minutes -- actually an extended description of its Nov. 1-2 meeting rather than a transcript -- make clear that a broad majority of the 10 voting members of the committee does not support more drastic action at the present time.
The minutes make little reference to proposals for new rounds of asset purchases, like buying larger amounts of government securities, the controversial strategy to lower long-term interest rates known as quantitative easing.
"There was little support for more quantitative easing, at least not before the communications review is concluded," Paul Ashworth, chief North American economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note Tuesday.
The November meeting was the first time since the summer that the Fed announced no new actions to support the economy. The committee said in a statement after the meeting that the economy was showing signs of modest improvement, though it also reduced its forecast for growth for the next two years.
The minutes of the meeting underscore the central bank's diminished expectations for economic activity.
"Participants generally agreed that, even with the positive news received over the intermeeting period, the most probable outcome was a moderate pace of economic growth over the medium run with only a gradual decline in the unemployment rate," the minutes say.
The document also notes that events in Europe could undermine the health of the domestic economy.
Against that bleak backdrop, a growing number of economists have called for the Fed to embrace more aggressive policies to stimulate the economy and reduce unemployment. In addition to new asset purchases, the central bank could seek to spur investment and job creation by expanding the money supply and accepting a higher rate of inflation.
But the Fed, already fretful that prices are increasing more quickly than it had expected, has shown little urgency in considering additional actions. The minutes note that members generally agreed that the central bank instead should focus first on improving its communications.
"A few members indicated that they believed the economic outlook might warrant additional policy accommodations," the minutes say. "However, it was noted that any such accommodation would likely be more effective if it were provided in the context of a future communications initiative."
Only one of the committee's 10 voting members dissented from this logic. Charles L. Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, reiterated his public position that the high rate of unemployment required more immediate and forceful action by the central bank. He said the Fed should commit to maintaining low interest rates until unemployment drops below 7 percent.
The Fed already has said that it intends to hold short-term rates near zero through at least the middle of 2013, and most likely even longer. And there is broad support, according to the minutes, for formalizing this type of prediction by regularly publishing a forecast of short-term rates. That idea has been placed in the hands of a subcommittee headed by the Fed's vice chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen.
Because the Fed can move the level of short-term interest rates, it can extend its influence by shaping the expectations of investors. For example, convincing investors that it intends to keep interest rates near zero for a longer period will tend to drive down rates on long-term loans, because those rates are set in large part based on expectations about short-term rates over the course of the loans.
There is less agreement about proposals to formalize rules for the management of monetary policy. Some Fed members, including its chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, have long favored the idea of formalizing a long-term inflation target of 2 percent. Others, including Mr. Evans, are pushing for temporary targets for unemployment and inflation to clarify the Fed's near-term objectives.
The committee dismissed the idea of adopting a new benchmark, like a commitment to pursue stimulus until the nation's economic output recovers from the recession. Such an approach is favored by a vocal chorus of outside economists, but has little support inside the institution, because of concern about the consequences of accepting more rapid inflation.
The verdict was reported in the Fed's typically understated style: "Participants agreed that it would not be advisable to make such a change under the present circumstances."

Full text: FRANKFURT -- Banks clamored for emergency funds from the European Central Bank on Tuesday, borrowing the most since early 2009 in a clear sign that the euro region's financial institutions are having trouble obtaining credit at reasonable rates on the open market.
Indebted governments among the 17 members of the European Union that use the euro are also finding it harder to borrow at affordable rates as investors lose confidence in their creditworthiness.
In a Tuesday auction, the Spanish treasury, for example, was forced to sell three-month bills at a price to yield 5.11 percent, more than double the 2.29 percent interest rate investors demanded at a sale of similar Spanish securities on Oct. 25. Spain also sold six-month debt at 5.23 percent Tuesday, up from 3.30 percent in October.
Italy's 10-year bond yield, meanwhile, edged up once again -- to nearly 6.8 percent Tuesday -- as foreign investors withdrew their money from that debt-staggered country.
Together, the commercial banks' heavy reliance on the central bank to finance their everyday business needs, along with the growing borrowing burden for Spain and Italy, raise the risk of failure for some banks within the countries that use the euro and the danger that nations much larger than Greece could eventually seek a bailout or be forced to leave the euro currency union.
European stocks were down broadly on Tuesday's gloomy news. In the United States, stocks closed lower, too, but were not down as much as they had been before the International Monetary Fund announced at midday that it would extend a six-month lending lifeline to nations that might seek it in response to the euro zone crisis.
At the same time, though, the central bank continued to resist calls that it stretch its mandate and expand the money supply, as the United States Federal Reserve and the Bank of England have done.
The European debt crisis has crimped the flow of funds to banks by raising doubts about the solvency of institutions with a large exposure to European government debt. In particular, American money market funds have severely cut back their lending to European banks in recent months, leading many institutions to turn to Europe's central bank.
Compounding the problem, many banks using the euro have also had trouble selling bonds to raise money that they can lend to customers. That raises the specter of a credit squeeze that could amplify an impending economic slowdown. In addition, some banks may fail if they are unable to raise short-term cash.
The central bank said Tuesday that commercial banks had taken out 247 billion euros, ($333 billion), in one-week loans, the largest amount since April 2009. And the 178 banks borrowing from the central bank on Tuesday compared with the 161 banks that borrowed 230 billion euros ($310 billion) last week.
Since 2008, the central bank has been allowing lenders to borrow as much as they want at the benchmark interest rate, which is now 1.25 percent. Banks must provide collateral. But the central bank is not supposed to prop up banks that are insolvent, only those that have a temporary liquidity problem.
And while the central bank has been buying bonds from countries like Spain and Italy to try to hold down their borrowing costs, the amount --195 billion euros ($263 billion) so far -- is modest compared with the quantitative easing employed by other central banks like the Fed.
A growing number of commentators say the European Central Bank should be authorized to buy government bonds at levels sufficient to stimulate the economy.
"It is essential to have a central bank free to use all the levers, including variants of quantitative easing," Adair Turner, chairman of Britain's bank regulator, the Financial Services Authority, told an audience in Frankfurt late Monday. The audience included Vitor Constancio, vice president of the central bank.
Richard Koo, chief economist at the Nomura Research Institute, wrote in a note Tuesday that "the E.C.B. should embark on a quantitative easing program similar in scale to those undertaken by Japan, the U.S. and the U.K."
"Doubling the current supply of liquidity," Mr. Koo said, "would not trigger inflation and would enable the E.C.B. to buy that much more euro zone government debt."
But there has been no sign the central bank will budge from its position that it is barred from financing governments, and that purchases of government bonds are justified only as a way of keeping control over interest rates and fulfilling the bank's main task to keep prices stable.
"By assuming the role of lender of last resort for highly indebted member states, the bank would overextend its mandate and shed doubt on the legitimacy of its independence," Jens Weidmann, president of the German Bundesbank and a member of the central bank's governing council, said Tuesday in Berlin.
"To follow this path would be like drinking seawater to quench a thirst," he said.
Lucas D. Papademos, the new prime minister of Greece and a former vice president of the central bank, met with Mario Draghi, the central bank's president, when he visited the bank on Monday. The bank did not disclose details of their discussions, but Greece's fate is to a large extent in the central bank's hands. Because of its bond purchases, the central bank is the Greek government's largest creditor, and the bank is one of the institutions that determines whether Greece will continue to receive aid from the 17 European Union members that use the euro.

3rd-Quarter U.S. Growth Revised Down to 2 Percent

Full text: The United States economy grew at a slightly slower rate than previously estimated in the third quarter, but weak inventory accumulation amid sturdy consumer spending strengthened analysts' views that output would pick up in the current quarter.
Gross domestic product grew at a 2 percent annual rate in the third quarter, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday, down from the previously estimated 2.5 percent.
The revision was below economists' expectations for a rate of 2.5 percent. But data showing consumer spending still firm and business inventories dropping for the first time since the fourth quarter of 2009 appeared to set the stage for a stronger economic performance this quarter.
Data so far suggests the fourth-quarter growth rate could exceed 3 percent, which would be the fastest in 18 months.
Despite the downward revision, the growth last quarter was still a step up from the 1.3 percent rate recorded in the April-June period. Part of the pickup in output during the last quarter reflected a reversal of factors that held back the economy earlier in the year.
A jump in gasoline prices weighed on consumer spending earlier in the year, and supply disruptions from the devastating earthquake and tsunami in March in Japan curbed auto production.
The government revised third-quarter output to account for an $8.5 billion drop in business inventories, which lopped 1.55 percentage points from G.D.P. growth. Inventories were previously estimated to have increased $5.4 billion.
The drag from inventories was offset by strong export growth. Excluding inventories, the economy grew at an unrevised rate of 3.6 percent after expanding 1.6 percent in the second quarter.
Consumer spending was revised down slightly to 2.3 percent from 2.4 percent because of adjustments to motor vehicle fuels and lubricants. It was still the fastest rate since the fourth quarter of 2010.
However, weak income growth could curtail spending. The report showed real disposable income fell 2.1 percent in the third quarter after declining 0.5 percent in the previous three months. There were also small revisions to business investment, which rose at a 14.8 percent rate instead of 16.3 percent as estimates for investment in nonresidential structures and outlays on equipment and software were lowered.
The Commerce Department also said after-tax corporate profits increased at a 3 percent rate after rising 4.3 percent in the second quarter.
Export growth was stronger than previously estimated, rising at a 4.3 percent rate instead of 4 percent. Imports increased at a much slower 0.5 percent rate rather than 1.9 percent.
Trade contributed almost half a percentage point to overall growth. Elsewhere, residential construction grew at a 1.6 percent rate instead of 2.4 percent.
The report showed inflation pressures subsiding. A price index for personal spending rose at a 2.3 percent rate in the third quarter, instead of 2.4 percent.

Abstract: In a touch of irony, Mr. Zweig, born in Vienna's golden age to affluent Jewish parents, alluded in the book's epigraph to a line in French, "une terre d'avenir," from correspondence received by Arthur de Gobineau, a 19th-century French aristocrat, diplomat and theorist of European racial superiority who detested Brazil.

Full text: PETROPOLIS, Brazil -- When the Viennese-born writer Stefan Zweig moved in 1941 to this city of imperial palaces nestled in the mountains near Rio de Janeiro, he was one of world's most translated authors, renowned for his taut novellas exploring passion, obsession and despair.
But after Mr. Zweig, despondent over the advances of the Nazis, took his own life here a few months later at age 60 in a suicide pact with his young wife, Lotte, he became known in his adopted country for creating one of most hackneyed phrases ever associated with Brazil: "Country of the Future."
Derived from the title of his 1941 book praising Latin America's largest country, the phrase got expanded and recycled ad nauseam as a refrain, "Brazil is the country of the future -- and always will be," used to casually dismiss a nation long plagued by high inflation and entrenched corruption.
With Brazil's prospects now notably improved, Brazilians are reassessing Mr. Zweig and his legacy as the book's title gains new currency yet again, with everyone from advertising executives to visiting European diplomats and even President Obama, who visited Brazil in March, using it in a speech to suggest that perhaps Brazil's "future" has finally arrived.
"Brazil isn't the country of the future anymore," said Romero Rodrigues, a Brazilian Internet entrepreneur, in one typical new repackaging of the term. "It's the country of the present."
The house where Mr. Zweig took his own life here by swallowing poison is set to reopen soon as a museum. Meanwhile, Brazilian writers and historians have been reflecting on the significance of "Land of the Future," and some of the political intrigue surrounding its publication 70 years ago.
In a recent televised discussion of Mr. Zweig, Alcino Leite Neto, editor of the publishing house Publifolha, compared his importance in Brazil to that in the United States of Alexis de Tocqueville, the French political thinker who wrote about American concepts of liberty and equality in "Democracy in America."
"We had Stefan Zweig," said Mr. Leite Neto, "who left us this book advocating tolerance, comprehension between people, an indictment in favor of peace, written right during World War II."
A broader appreciation of his work is also under way, with two Brazilian feature films in production adapted from his writing, one from "The Invisible Collection," about Germany's experience with inflation, and another from "Leporella," about a housemaid who becomes infatuated with her employer.
But it is "Land of the Future" itself (published here since the 1940s in various editions as "Country of the Future"), and Mr. Zweig's wanderings in Brazil before his death, which have recently ignited the most interest.
Cultural officials in Petropolis this year organized a multimedia exhibit called "Stefan Zweig Lives!", and some Brazilians have begun joining the Europeans and Americans who occasionally appear in the city to see his house on Goncalves Dias Street, or even the cemetery where he and Lotte are buried side by side.
"It's a little strange taking someone to the places of such tragedy, but we're happy to receive every kind of visitor," said Walter Raposo, 80, a horse-carriage driver in Petropolis who has guided several Zweig aficionados to these spots; they find Mr. Raposo and his carriage in front of the Brazilian emperor's former summer palace, now a museum.
Alberto Dines, a television host and eminence among Brazil's journalists who met Mr. Zweig as a child when the writer visited his school in Rio de Janeiro, has been a driving force behind the renewed attention in Petropolis and beyond.
His research and his own book on Mr. Zweig, "Death in Paradise," explore in detail the complicated origins of the book's title, which Mr. Dines explains was not Mr. Zweig's creation but a suggestion from James Stern, who translated his book into English from the German.
In a touch of irony, Mr. Zweig, born in Vienna's golden age to affluent Jewish parents, alluded in the book's epigraph to a line in French, "une terre d'avenir," from correspondence received by Arthur de Gobineau, a 19th-century French aristocrat, diplomat and theorist of European racial superiority who detested Brazil.
"It's a curious thing, because Gobineau was the father of modern racism," said Mr. Dines, who at age 79 is overseeing the completion of Casa Stefan Zweig, the museum created at the house where Mr. Zweig lived. "Coming from racist Europe, Zweig was amazed seeing the different races mixing so freely in Brazil."
Of course, some contend Mr. Zweig's largely optimistic observations on race relations at the time belied circumstances that were considerably more complex -- and continue to be as affirmative action programs spreading across Brazil seek to reverse centuries of exclusion.
Still, Mr. Zweig's optimism was not dimmed by the obvious challenges in Brazil in the early 1940s, like an average life expectancy of 43 years and a population that was 56 percent illiterate. Some of his sanguine assessments continue to impress today.
He claimed, for instance, that Portugal had been farsighted by colonizing Brazil partly by emptying Portuguese prisons of undesired elements and sending them across the Atlantic. "As usual, it is not altogether clean manure which is the earth's best preparation for future harvests," Mr. Zweig wrote.
Mr. Zweig's reappraisal here coincides with renewed crisis in Europe -- and with a new wave of Portuguese emigration to Brazil, but this time of unemployed professionals, not convicts. Some of those seeking opportunity in Brazil may even know that Mr. Zweig remains highly esteemed in parts of Europe, especially France, where his books are still widely available.
Strangely, Mr. Zweig's book on Brazil was fiercely criticized in Brazil shortly after its publication. Critics laid waste to the Austrian writer with vehemence, opening him to insinuation that he was paid by the authoritarian regime of Getulio Vargas to write the book.
Mr. Dines said the scathing reviews had been a way for reviewers to indirectly get back at Mr. Vargas's censors, since the critics equated praising Brazil with praising its dictatorship. Either way, the author of numerous best sellers had little need for Brazil's financial support.
But Mr. Zweig did need something else at the time: a haven from the Nazis. Mr. Dines, based on his own research of Mr. Zweig's path to Brazil, argues that the writer had an implicit deal with Brazilian authorities to produce his book in exchange for the residence permits hastily granted in Buenos Aires to him and his wife.
After all that, some mystery persists as to why he would kill himself soon after arriving in Brazil. He had acknowledged that a lifetime might be insufficient to properly understand Brazil. But in the suicide note he left describing himself as "one without a country," he still had only praise for the "marvelous" Brazil that received him.
"After I saw the country of my own language fall, and my spiritual land -- Europe -- destroying itself," he concluded, "it would require immense strength to reconstruct my life."

Full text: There's a word I keep hearing lately: "technocrat." Sometimes it's used as a term of scorn -- the creators of the euro, we're told, were technocrats who failed to take human and cultural factors into account. Sometimes it's a term of praise: the newly installed prime ministers of Greece and Italy are described as technocrats who will rise above politics and do what needs to be done.
I call foul. I know from technocrats; sometimes I even play one myself. And these people -- the people who bullied Europe into adopting a common currency, the people who are bullying both Europe and the United States into austerity -- aren't technocrats. They are, instead, deeply impractical romantics.
They are, to be sure, a peculiarly boring breed of romantic, speaking in turgid prose rather than poetry. And the things they demand on behalf of their romantic visions are often cruel, involving huge sacrifices from ordinary workers and families. But the fact remains that those visions are driven by dreams about the way things should be rather than by a cool assessment of the way things really are.
And to save the world economy we must topple these dangerous romantics from their pedestals.
Let's start with the creation of the euro. If you think that this was a project driven by careful calculation of costs and benefits, you have been misinformed.
The truth is that Europe's march toward a common currency was, from the beginning, a dubious project on any objective economic analysis. The continent's economies were too disparate to function smoothly with one-size-fits-all monetary policy, too likely to experience "asymmetric shocks" in which some countries slumped while others boomed. And unlike U.S. states, European countries weren't part of a single nation with a unified budget and a labor market tied together by a common language.
So why did those "technocrats" push so hard for the euro, disregarding many warnings from economists? Partly it was the dream of European unification, which the Continent's elite found so alluring that its members waved away practical objections. And partly it was a leap of economic faith, the hope -- driven by the will to believe, despite vast evidence to the contrary -- that everything would work out as long as nations practiced the Victorian virtues of price stability and fiscal prudence.
Sad to say, things did not work out as promised. But rather than adjusting to reality, those supposed technocrats just doubled down -- insisting, for example, that Greece could avoid default through savage austerity, when anyone who actually did the math knew better.
Let me single out in particular the European Central Bank (E.C.B.), which is supposed to be the ultimate technocratic institution, and which has been especially notable for taking refuge in fantasy as things go wrong. Last year, for example, the bank affirmed its belief in the confidence fairy -- that is, the claim that budget cuts in a depressed economy will actually promote expansion, by raising business and consumer confidence. Strange to say, that hasn't happened anywhere.
And now, with Europe in crisis -- a crisis that can't be contained unless the E.C.B. steps in to stop the vicious circle of financial collapse -- its leaders still cling to the notion that price stability cures all ills. Last week Mario Draghi, the E.C.B.'s new president, declared that "anchoring inflation expectations" is "the major contribution we can make in support of sustainable growth, employment creation and financial stability."
This is an utterly fantastic claim to make at a time when expected European inflation is, if anything, too low, and what's roiling the markets is fear of more or less immediate financial collapse. And it's more like a religious proclamation than a technocratic assessment.
Just to be clear, this is not an anti-European rant, since we have our own pseudo-technocrats warping the policy debate. In particular, allegedly nonpartisan groups of "experts" -- the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, the Concord Coalition, and so on -- have been all too successful at hijacking the economic policy debate, shifting its focus from jobs to deficits.
Real technocrats would have asked why this makes sense at a time when the unemployment rate is 9 percent and the interest rate on U.S. debt is only 2 percent. But like the E.C.B., our fiscal scolds have their story about what's important, and they're sticking to it no matter what the data say.
So am I against technocrats? Not at all. I like technocrats -- technocrats are friends of mine. And we need technical expertise to deal with our economic woes.
But our discourse is being badly distorted by ideologues and wishful thinkers -- boring, cruel romantics -- pretending to be technocrats. And it's time to puncture their pretensions.

Full text: London
BOTH the American economy and the global economy are facing a familiar foe: policy defeatism. Throughout modern economic history, whether in Western Europe in the 1920s, in the United States in the 1930s, or in Japan in the 1990s, every major financial crisis has been followed by premature abandonment -- if not reversal -- of the stimulus policies that are necessary for sustained recovery. Sadly, the world appears to be repeating this mistake.
The right thing to do right now is for the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank to engage in further monetary stimulus. Having lowered short-term interest rates, they should buy (or in the case of the Fed, resume buying) significant quantities of government securities to help push down long-term interest rates and encourage investment.
If anything, it is past time for the Fed and its European counterpart to act. The economic outlook has turned out to be as grim as forecasts based on historical evidence predicted it would be, given the nature of the recession, the cutbacks in government spending and the simultaneity of economic problems across the Western world. Sustained high inflation is not a threat in this environment.
As many have observed, we need to rebalance the economy from imports to exports, from private consumption to savings, from tax breaks to infrastructure rebuilding and from the financial sector to everything else. The process of rebalancing will require movement of capital from older industries and activities to newer ones -- that is, investment. Moreover, a lot of what was termed "investment" during the boom years was misallocated -- wasted -- capital, so many productive projects were ignored.
But investment has been held back because of uncertainty over the economy's future prospects. And the ability to attract investors is being limited by the giant burden of private-sector debt. In other words, a financing problem is inhibiting the restructuring of our economy. Alleviating generalized financing problems and low investor confidence is precisely what monetary stimulus does.
Some claim that monetary easing will impede restructuring. But this makes no sense. For all the talk that monetary austerity promotes the "creative destruction" necessary for the economy to recover, it does not work that way.
In Japan in the 1990s, a period of insufficiently aggressive monetary stimulus fed lending to "zombie companies" -- unproductive borrowers on whose loans the banks could not afford to take losses. It was only when macroeconomic policy led a recovery in Japan in the first decade of this century that capital flowed out of the places it had been trapped and into new and growing businesses. Similarly, after the American savings-and-loan crisis, real reallocation of credit from bad banks and borrowers to worthwhile investment began in earnest only when monetary policy eased in the late 1980s.
Another source of policy defeatism is the widespread but false belief that our previous "unconventional" efforts to stimulate the economy either were not terribly effective or are unlikely to be effective if extended today. The fact that the American economy has not fully recovered after previous rounds of stimulus is not evidence that those failed to work at all.
We know that infusions of central bank money to the economy have been closely associated with falling long-term interest rates. We know that the relative price of riskier assets has gone up, indicating greater demand for them, when stimulus has been undertaken. And we know that banks have received increased deposits, and that investors and households have expressed increased confidence, after prior rounds of quantitative easing. That combination has had a stimulative impact, just as a cut in the interest rate would have in ordinary times.
Scientific research tells us that high blood pressure and cholesterol are associated with a higher risk of heart disease and stroke, and that certain prescription medications reduce cholesterol and blood pressure. Yes, it is difficult to prove directly that taking these medicines prevents heart disease and stroke, and taking them is no guarantee of health. But still we should take them, and our doctors should prescribe them if they are indicated. This is the same situation we are in now, with our economy's financial circulation at risk, and quantitative easing the indicated medicine.
In my opinion, we can go further. Central banks and governments can engage in forms of coordinated action that will target the burden of past debts that is hanging over the global economy. In the United States, that means resolving the distressed mortgage debt that is weakening our financial system and reducing labor mobility, thereby constraining not only our growth but also our ability to grow. It is time for the Federal Reserve and elected officials to explore ways to jointly tackle that housing debt.
Independent central bankers tend to become very squeamish about expressing support for any particular government proposal, especially when it involves agreeing to buy government bonds. Tragedies have occurred, however, when independent central banks let worries about the perception that they were too close to the government prevent them from doing something constructive in times of crisis.
Such passivity led to the prolonged recession in Japan in the 1990s. It was only when the Bank of Japan and the Ministry of Finance abandoned their mutual distrust and worked together publicly in 2002-3 that Japan had a sustained recovery. The same kind of distrust between monetary and fiscal officials, and concerns about being perceived as too close to each other, is bringing the euro area to the brink of disaster today.
Central bank independence is not primarily a matter of reputation, but of reality. What matters is what central banks do, not whether they maintain an appearance of disdain toward the messy realities of economic and political life. The inflation-fighting credibility of central banks is not vulnerable to voluntary purchases of bonds, public or private, made with reference to clear and long-held economic goals. Therefore, if the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank respond to the crisis with available tools, including large-scale bond purchases (as the Bank of England has already begun to do), they will enhance their credibility and independence for the future.
Almost certainly, even if we were to do everything right on monetary policy (and we certainly will not get everything right, despite the best of intentions), some economic suffering will continue. But it is the responsibility and duty of central bankers to make things better if we can.
Central bank officials have wasted too much time over the last year worrying about how their institutions would appear to markets, to politicians and to the public, were they to undertake more stimulus. Sometimes you have to do the right thing even if the benefits take time to become evident. If we do not undertake the monetary stimulus that the grim outlook calls for, then our economies and our people will suffer avoidable and potentially lasting damage.

Full text: Meet Ukraine's harsh mistress of high fashion.
In 1994, three years after the fall of the Soviet Union, Ukraine was an unmitigated economic disaster. The inflation rate had reached nearly 100 percent per month. Fat-cat politicos feasted on assets that once belonged to the state, and more than half of all economic activity was estimated to be illegal. The national currency, known then as "coupons," became so worthless that one Ukrainian factory used it to produce toilet paper.
It was at this moment of total insecurity that Oksana Sergeevna Moroz, a wealthy woman from Kiev, knocked on the showroom door of Azzedine Alaia in Paris. She had come with a simple message: Let's do business. But before she could sell Alaia at home, she had to sell herself to the West.
"I was dressed all in Chanel because I loved Chanel at that moment. In our country, maybe 10 people understood what it was," said Moroz-Hunt. (She now goes by the name of her deceased ex-husband.) "And when I came to Alaia, very elegant, wearing a gold Rolex watch, they started to touch me, and they looked at my watch and asked, 'Is this a real Rolex?' "
Before long, clothes designed by Alaia, Gianfranco Ferre and Thierry Mugler arrived at Moroz-Hunt's small store, called Vogue, in central Kiev. "I would hire a special security company with guns and armor because at the moment everything would get stolen and broken on the roads."
Moroz-Hunt decorated the shop herself and dressed all the mannequins. She served imported chocolates and Champagne. Astronomically expensive by local standards, the clothes she sold dressed the wives and girlfriends of the country's emerging elite. Before she entered politics, the famously braided former prime minister Yulia V. Tymoshenko (who is now in jail) also came there. Seventeen years later, Moroz-Hunt's boutique has become Sanahunt, a gleaming multilevel department store for New Ukrainians who crave everything from Celine bags to stuffed animals made of chinchilla.
In the passion play that is post-Soviet Ukraine, Moroz-Hunt sees herself as fashion messiah. "I understood that people were dressed awfully. They were very low-cultured. But they wanted to change," she said. "I saw how they looked at me, how they tried to mirror me." But as with any messianic figure, Moroz-Hunt's path to fashion salvation was beset by persecution, both real and imagined.
On a screaming hot day in Kiev, back in June, Philip Vlasov met me on the ground floor of Sanahunt, next to the Balenciaga boots and the Y.S.L. sling-backs. He had recently moved to Kiev from Moscow (where he worked for Russian Vogue) to become Sanahunt's marketing director. Vlasov is soft-spoken. He was wearing expensive sweatpants and had an unruly mop of hair dyed almost white. A few months after we met, he would quit, citing exhaustion and frustration with Moroz-Hunt; she said that she chose not to renew his contract.
At our first encounter he was still upbeat. "Kiev is like Moscow in the '90s," Vlasov said. "Now, in Moscow, people spend less. Even rich people - they've started wearing High Street brands. But here it's still about showing off."
We were seated on the leafy fourth-floor terrace of the Sanahunt Lounge, eating that mayonnaised Soviet staple salat olivier (this one topped with black caviar). One block away is Budynok Uryadu, a massive Stalinist edifice where the prime minster and other officials have their offices. Politicians eat lunch at the Lounge all the time.
The wealthiest Ukrainians, Vlasov said, tend to buy brands that have been traditionally popular in Eastern Europe, like Dolce & Gabbana and Versace.
But Sanahunt also stocks designers that don't translate as easily into the local market, like Joseph Altuzarra and Alexander Wang. They sell poorly and at the end of the season are sharply discounted.
"Sometimes I get clothes, knowing they might not sell," Moroz-Hunt said. "But I still buy them because my clients must see that they exist."
Cecilia Dean, the editor of Visionaire, met Moroz-Hunt this year when she was in Kiev for a Sanahunt event. "It's a really impressive store," Dean said. "It was curated very well." She can't recall what Moroz-Hunt was wearing "but I'm sure it was something with a lot of cleavage. She's got a body and she flaunts it. More power to her."
In August, Moroz-Hunt met me in the lobby lounge of the Mandarin Oriental hotel in New York, which, along with the
George V in Paris, she thinks of as "like home." (Her actual homes are in Kiev and Cannes, France, where she owns a villa.) She was dressed in a black Alexander McQueen blazer, a white tuxedo shirt by Stella McCartney, black Balenciaga pants and dangerously sharp Jimmy Choo heels.
"Caviar?" she asked a waiter, not impolitely, in thickly accented English. "American sturgeon - what is this? If you have something good, give us." Rose Champagne arrived along with caviar-topped tuna tartare.
It is unclear how much money Moroz-Hunt has. NetJets features a customer profile of her on its Web site. In Kiev, where she has bodyguards, she drives around in a chauffeured Rolls-Royce Phantom. In Cannes, she has a Ferrari. She said that Sanahunt was built on an initial investment of $340,000 and has grown purely through profits.
When Moroz-Hunt first began to make money, her landlord decided arbitrarily to raise her rent. This was her first brush with post-Soviet business ethics. "My personality is I hate when people blackmail me," she said. "I just don't let them mess with me."
Moroz-Hunt is trim, busty, thick-lipped and long-nailed. Christophe Robin, the celebrated Paris colorist, tends to her platinum hair. Her visage seems to morph from pallid to uncomfortably flushed, depending on the topic of conversation.
"I've had a few husbands," she said. "But I'm not married right now. Maybe, I don't know, maybe it wasn't the right people. Or maybe the business and husbands just don't work out."
Moroz-Hunt said she was born in Kiev in 1964, the child of scientist parents. Before the Wall came down, she lived in Moscow and, she told me, was married to a judo star whose status enabled her to travel widely and be exposed to fashion. She eventually divorced him and in the late 1990s, after she moved back to Kiev, met Alexander Hunt, a Russian who had at one time immigrated to the United States. They married ("Sanahunt" is a hybrid of their two names) and, in 2000, had a son, Nicholas, who attends a private school in the south of France.
At some point their relationship soured, dramatically. According to court papers, Hunt left Ukraine in January 2003, and the couple divorced, on April Fool's Day, in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. Then, in June, Moroz-Hunt sent a letter to the Interior Ministry, claiming that Hunt had a criminal history and that he came to Cannes and threatened to kidnap Nicholas while he was under the care of a nanny there.
Hunt was subsequently banned from the country and stripped of his parental rights by Ukrainian courts. In response, in 2004, he sued Ukraine in the European Court of Human Rights, arguing that the government took illegal steps at Moroz-Hunt's behest. In 2006, the court awarded Hunt about $13,000 in damages.
"He wanted to take everything," Moroz-Hunt said. She said she became gravely ill during the custody battle and speaks of that period cryptically, as if she were the victim of an intricate plot at some imperial court. "My entourage was waiting for me to die," she said.
She became emotional when discussing her ex-husband. "He did many things. He sued me. He threatened me," she said. "A lot of story! And, end of story is, he is dead. I was very close to death, and unfortunately, I don't know how it's possible, he had a heart attack and he died. That was three years ago."
The Ukrainian press, not surprisingly, had a field day with the story, writing thinly sourced exposes filled with lurid details. And the Hunt affair is not the only incident that fuels Moroz-Hunt's murky mystique.
She is connected to Leonid Kuchma, Ukraine's controversial former president, through his daughter, Elena Pinchuk, who is the godmother of Moroz-Hunt's son.
In 2008, Moroz-Hunt and Viktor A. Yushchenko, the former president, became godparents of a mutual friend's daughter.
People in Kiev seem to know Moroz-Hunt's reputation better than what clothes she puts in her store. Security at Sanahunt is tight. When I came in unannounced, a day before my meeting with Vlasov, a shopkeeper trailed me suspiciously from room to room. The store was mostly deserted, save for an Orthodox Jew and a stout businessman exchanging Russian anecdotes on the lounge terrace. This makes one wonder who exactly shops at Sanahunt.
"My friends and I, we never go in there," said Natasha Lysova, a former journalist who is now Tymoshenko's spokeswoman. "We couldn't afford anything." The average gross monthly salary in Ukraine is about $320, which buys a few orders of lobster pasta at the Sanahunt Lounge.
Still, Sanahunt is a symbol of what can now be achieved in Ukraine - through grit and vision, or shady dealings and high-placed connections, or all of the above. I asked Moroz-Hunt if many of her customers came from the oligarchy, which swelled during last decade's commodities boom. "Of course. They love beautiful things," she said. "We treat them like royalty."
Moroz-Hunt is at work on a second Sanahunt store, to open in 2013 in Odessa, on the Black Sea coast. She also plans to unveil a capsule collection, provided she can find an appropriate designer. During his time at the store, Vlasov had struggled with this task.
"Finally," he said, "I insisted on Miguel Adrover, whom she hadn't known but found interesting." Vlasov found Adrover in Majorca, Spain, and convinced him to come to Paris to negotiate terms, but then Moroz-Hunt canceled the meeting at the last minute.
"She called me and said, 'You know, I realized that I really like Adrover's styling, but I don't like the shoulder line on his garments. It's rounded. It's weak. I want the Chanel shoulder line: straight, or even pointing upwards.' "
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text: FRANKFURT -- The financial stability of Europe has come down to one institution, the European Central Bank, which is now under heavy new pressure to rescue the euro -- or possibly see it collapse.
Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, Spain's prime minister, on Thursday became the latest leader to demand that the bank find a solution to the euro crisis, saying that "this is what we transferred power for" and that it had to be a bank "that defends the common policy and its countries."
Mr. Zapatero made his unusually blunt statements on a day when markets sagged further and contagion continued its seemingly inexorable spread from the small economies on Europe's periphery to Italy, Spain and even France at the core. Spain was forced Thursday to pay nearly 7 percent on an issue of 10-year debt, the highest since 1997, while investors demanded the largest premium for buying French as opposed to German debt in the decade-long history of the euro.
Only the fiercely conservative stewards of the European Central Bank have the firepower to intervene aggressively in the markets with essentially unlimited resources. But the bank itself, and its most important member state, Germany, have steadfastly resisted letting it take up the mantle of lender of last resort.
European politicians and analysts say that unbending stance now threatens the survival of the euro and the broader integration of Europe itself.
"There is no solution to the crisis without the E.C.B.," said Charles Wyplosz, a professor at the Graduate Institute in Geneva and co-author of a standard textbook on European integration. "The amounts we are talking about are too big for anybody but the E.C.B."
At issue is whether the bank has the will -- or the legal foundation -- to become a European version of the Federal Reserve in the United States, with a license to print money in whatever quantity it considers necessary to ensure the smooth functioning of markets and, if needed, to essentially bail out countries that are members of the euro zone.
Traditionally, and according to its charter, the European bank has viewed its role in much narrower terms, as a guardian of the value of the euro with a mission to prevent inflation. But as market unease has spread over the past two years, critics say the bank's obsession with what they say is a phantom threat of inflation has stifled growth and helped bring the euro zone to the edge of a financial precipice.
With events threatening to spin out of control, the burden now rests on Mario Draghi, an inflation fighter in the president's job at the bank barely two weeks who surprised many economists by immediately cutting interest rates a quarter point.
"Everything until now is just a prelude. This is where it gets serious," said Peter Zeihan, vice president of analysis at Stratfor, a geopolitical research center. "This is not purely economics. This is about Germany's position in Europe and whether they control the institutions or not."
Angela Merkel, Germany's chancellor, and President Nicolas Sarkozy of France held a conference call on Thursday with Italy's newly sworn-in prime minister, Mario Monti, to discuss how Italy could win back the confidence of markets, Mrs. Merkel's office said in a statement. German policy makers believe the crisis is serving a purpose, keeping pressure on free-spending governments and forcing them to reform. Any rescue by the European Central Bank, they say, would only delay the inevitable reckoning.
Unlike the Federal Reserve, which has a mandate to promote employment as well as to fight inflation, the European Central Bank is charged first and foremost with maintaining price stability. In addition, the bank is specifically prohibited from financing the governments of euro area members.
So far, the bank's bond interventions have been modest by central bank standards -- $252 billion so far, compared with more than $2 trillion purchased by the Federal Reserve in recent years. The European bank does not disclose details of its purchases, but it has been active lately, and traders said it bought Spanish and Italian bonds on Thursday in small amounts, Reuters reported.
In theory, the bank's ability to buy bonds is unlimited because it can print money. There would certainly be legal complaints about its violating its charter, but legal experts say those are questionable, and in any event the euro crisis will be decided long before the cases are adjudicated.
The political constraints, however, remain formidable, and as always Germany plays the pivotal role. While wielding only 2 of the 23 votes on the bank's governing council, Germany is the biggest contributor to its capital, and Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank, is the biggest institution in the network of central banks that conduct most of the European bank's business, including market intervention.
The bank's focus on price stability was transplanted from the Bundesbank, where the aversion to inflation is virtually genetic. In German eyes, there is a de facto promise that the bank will never turn loose the printing presses to bail out overindebted nations.
That path "belongs to the deadly sins of a central bank," Wolfgang Franz, chairman of the German Council of Economic Experts, an official panel that advises the government, said in an interview with the Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper.
Many economists say there is little risk of inflation in the sagging European economy, but any large-scale intervention would create a political uproar. The bank could move quickly, said Richard Portes, professor of economics at the London Business School, but "it needs political cover to do what it needs to do."
It is not clear where that will come from. In a speech in Berlin on Thursday, Mrs. Merkel cautioned, "If politicians believe the E.C.B. can solve the problem of the euro's weakness, then they're trying to convince themselves of something that won't happen."
Germany has reason to be cautious. In the event that Italian, Spanish and other bonds had to be written down the way that Greek bonds were, Berlin would have to pay the most to recapitalize the bank. That would be tantamount to a backdoor bailout, a transfer of money from German taxpayers to cover the debts of other states without parliamentary approval.
"New Yorkers don't mind transferring money year after year to Appalachia, but in Europe, people do mind," said Dennis J. Snower, president of the Kiel Institute for the World Economy. "Populism would rise, the European project would truly be in danger because the democratic deficit would explode."
Much discussion has centered on whether Greece might leave or be forced to leave the euro zone, but the Germans might question whether they should stay if all their most cherished principles are violated.
"The Germans are pushing to amend the treaties right now so a country could leave the euro zone," said Mr. Zeihan of Stratfor. "In the end, Germany might leave."

Full text: PARIS -- Throughout Europe's long debt crisis, Germany has prescribed the same strong remedy to its troubled neighbors: a stiff dose of fiscal discipline.
As long as the patients were southern European countries like Greece and Italy, seen as victims of an unhealthy lifestyle, northern-tier nations like France, Austria and the Netherlands have been willing to go along with Germany's prescriptions for reducing debt in the name of economic health. And they were willing to support Germany's insistence that the European Central Bank not be a lender of last resort to indebted governments by actively buying their bonds.
But suddenly, as investors' fears mount that many euro area nations are about to tip into recession, even countries like creditworthy France are finding it much more expensive to borrow money in the open market. And with that development comes a dawning realization: that austerity, rather than making it easier for them to pay down their higher debts, could make it harder -- and more expensive.
The exposure of the United States, and in particular its banks, to Europe's debt problems caused a sharp sell-off in stocks Wednesday in the final two hours of trading. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, flat on the day by about 2 p.m., lost 20.9 points, or 1.66 percent, to close at 1,236.91, after the rating agency Fitch warned that United States banks were vulnerable if Europe did not solve its crisis quickly.
As investors worried about the European sovereign debt held by banks and their vulnerability to stress in the European financial system, bank shares led the declines. Goldman Sachs lost 4 percent to $95.50. Morgan Stanley closed down 8 percent at $14.66. Citigroup lost about 4 percent to $26.90.
"All this underscores the ongoing nervousness about Europe generally and the banking sector specifically," said Barry Knapp, head of American equity strategy at Barclays Capital.
In Europe, as France's borrowing costs become increasingly divergent from Germany's, so might its attitude toward having the European Central Bank step in. Already, French officials are openly disagreeing with Germany on the policy.
On Wednesday, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany continued to speak out against the idea of the central bank buying bonds, while the French finance minister, Francois Baroin, was arguing just the opposite.
Mr. Baroin called for the support of all European institutions, including the central bank, to respond to the crisis. "But Germany, for historic reasons, has closed the door to the direct involvement of the E.C.B.," Mr. Baroin said in an interview with the French business newspaper Les Echos.
Mr. Baroin's remark was a reference to Germany's deep-seated fears over the inflation that could result if the central bank pumped more money into the region's economies.
The so-called yield gap -- the premium that investors demand for holding French 10-year government bonds, rather than German ones -- rose Wednesday to a new high since the euro began of nearly two percentage points. It later eased back somewhat, to 1.9 percentage points.
That is still not close to the yield gap of nearly 5.2 percentage points that beleaguered Italy has with Germany, but it is a disturbing new trend for France. Austria and Netherlands are also experiencing widening yield gaps with Germany, and Spain has become a new source for concern.
The central bank was more aggressively in the market buying the bonds of Italy and Spain on Wednesday to stabilize the situation, traders said. It bought about 146 million euros, more than the 28 million euros it had bought over the previous two days, according to TD Securities. That helped lower yields earlier, but the effect didn't last and interest rates rose again later.
In Spain, which holds elections this weekend, the 10-year yield rose to 6.4 percent -- up from 5 percent just five weeks ago, and back to the levels that first prompted the central bank to begin its current relatively low-level bond buying program in the summer.
In its warning, Fitch said United States banks "could be greatly affected if contagion continues to spread beyond the stressed European markets." The banks' exposure to European countries' debt and to European banks was "sizable" then "unless the euro zone debt crisis is resolved in a timely and orderly manner, the broad outlook for U.S. banks will darken."
Another agency, Moody's, downgraded several German lenders, adding to investors' jitters.
Italy continues to be a major source of bond market worries, despite the announcement Wednesday by its new prime minister, Mario Monti, of a new cabinet stocked with academics and people from the banking industry and the upper reaches of the civil service.
Italian 10-year yields were back to nearly 7 percent, the level at which analysts say financing the country's 1.8 trillion euro ($2.4 trillion ) debt mountain becomes unsustainable.
But the market anxiety has moved well beyond Italy, as the specter of a regionwide recession is making investors realize that if every country is tightening its belt at the same time, few will be able to grow their way out of the problems any time soon.
So far, France, the Netherlands and Austria have been among Germany's allies in the crisis. France, eager to show that the French-German axis is thriving, has even backed Germany's stance on central bank lending. The question now, though, is whether other countries will start to resist Germany's policy prescriptions.
"The Germans have been able to rely on the French, the Dutch and the Austrians," said Simon Tilford, the chief economist at the Center for European Reform in London. "But if they get dragged into this and their borrowing costs continue to rise, that could influence whether they continue to back Germany and the line taken on the euro zone crisis."
On Wednesday, the French government showed a clear sign of divergence. It called on the central bank to help calm the crisis by buying the bonds of Italy, Greece and other governments whose borrowing costs are surging.
"The E.C.B.'s role is to ensure the stability of the euro, but also the financial stability of Europe," said Valerie Pecresse, the French budget minister.
Mr. Baroin, the French finance minister, went further, alluding to the German fear of inflation, which many historians say helped Hitler's rise to power. Indeed, much of Germany's response to the current economic crisis is rooted in a desire not to let history repeat itself.
Mr. Baroin said that the United States Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan had intervened in their bond markets with little fear that they were being influenced politically. "But Germany has a history, a memory about inflation and overindebtedness," he said.
The central bank is also being sought out by banks that are desperate for cheap financing to offset losses. The chief executive of UniCredit, one of Italy's largest lenders, urged the European Central Bank to increase access to central bank borrowing for Italian banks, the Italian press reported.
Berlin fears that allowing countries to rely on the central bank as a white knight would make them lazy about fixing their own finances. On Monday, Jens Weidmann, president of the German Bundesbank and an influential member of the European Central Bank's governing council, said it would be illegal to use the bank to solve government budget problems.
"The increasing demand being placed on monetary policy is dangerous," Mr. Weidmann said. "Monetary policy cannot and may not solve the solvency problems of governments and banks."
Analysts, though, say the time for insisting on ideology is quickly running out. Because European policy makers still have not started up the main bailout fund for Europe -- the European Financial Stability Facility -- there are virtually no other tools besides austerity to whittle down debts and deficits.
But, said Mr. Tilford, the euro zone "is going to crack unless E.C.B. enters the picture soon." If the central bank really starts carrying out the lender of last resort function, then the crisis can still be reined in, he and others said.
The question is whether the central bank is engaging in a strategy of brinkmanship to extract as many reforms from governments before it intervenes, or whether it genuinely intends to resist pressure to be a lender of last resort.
"If it's a game of chicken, then it's a very risky one," said Mr. Tilford. "If they are resisting becoming a lender of last resort, then the future of the euro zone is very much in doubt."

Retail Sales Rose 0.5% in October, Suggesting a Solid Start to the Quarter

Full text: Americans spent more on autos, electronics and building supplies in October, pushing up retail sales for a fifth consecutive month, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. The report suggests the economy maintained solid growth at the start of the fourth quarter.
Retail sales increased 0.5 percent from the previous month, the agency said. Strong auto sales helped, but even without them, sales rose 0.6 percent, and when excluding autos and sales at gasoline stations, sales rose 0.7 percent.
Overall sales increased even though sales at department stores and specialty clothing stores fell in October.
The retail sales report is the government's first look each month at consumer spending, which accounts for 70 percent of economic activity in the United States.
A rebound in consumer spending was a primary reason that the economy expanded at an annual rate of 2.5 percent in the third quarter, which ended in September, the best quarterly growth in a year.
Stronger economic growth helped calm fears that the economy could slide back into a recession. Still, growth would most likely need to be nearly double the third-quarter rate -- consistently -- to make a significant dent in unemployment.
Another concern is that the growth came from consumers spending more while earning less, a trend that economists fear cannot be sustained.
Without more jobs and higher pay, consumers may be forced to cut back on spending.
The outlook for hiring is mixed. The economy added just 80,000 jobs last month, the fewest in four months. But the government also said employers added more jobs in August and September than it had initially reported, and that the unemployment rate dipped to 9 percent. Employers advertised more jobs in September than at any other point in the last three years, a hopeful sign that hiring will pick up.
Americans are buying more cars. The auto industry had its best October in four years, as sales of S.U.V.'s and trucks offset a loss in momentum for car buying.
Retailers hope consumers will keep spending during the all-important holiday shopping period.
The National Retail Federation, the nation's largest retail group, predicts revenue in November and December will rise 2.8 percent this year compared with last year. That would be smaller than last year's 5.2 percent increase. But it would be higher than the average increase over the last 10 years.
The uptick in retail sales occurred as the Labor Department reported that wholesale prices declined in October for the first time since June, as companies paid less for gas, new cars and other goods. The report indicated that inflation pressures eased as the cost of oil and other commodities declined.
The Labor Department said the Producer Price Index, which measures price changes before they reach the consumer, dropped 0.3 percent in October, after a rise of 0.8 percent in September. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, the core index was unchanged for the first time in 11 months.
Falling energy prices drove the overall decline.
Food prices rose 0.1 percent, after four months of much larger increases.
The Commerce Department, meanwhile, said on Tuesday that business inventories were unchanged in September after 20 consecutive monthly gains, suggesting concern that future sales could slow. Business sales rose 0.6 percent in September, the fourth consecutive gain.

Abstract: Republicans and some Democrats saw a possible breakthrough last week when Republicans on the committee, long hostile to new taxes, offered the proposal to raise $300 billion in new tax revenue, mainly by scaling back tax deductions for higher-income households. Democrats balked Tuesday at a possible bipartisan agreement that would save tens of billions of dollars by reducing the annual cost-of-living adjustment in Social Security benefits.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Congressional leaders began to insert themselves more deeply Tuesday into the work of a joint committee charged with taming the deficit, as Republicans in both chambers embraced a plan devised by Senator Patrick J. Toomey, one of their party's representatives on the panel. Democrats appeared to be less united and struggling to come up with a counteroffer.
House Republicans, back from a week of recess, met to discuss the Republican offer, which includes $300 billion in new tax revenue over 10 years and a rewriting of the tax code. The package was warmly received by many House Republicans at a meeting of their caucus on Tuesday, according to people who attended.
"All of us have a lot of respect for Pat Toomey," said Representative Jeff Flake of Arizona, one of the most conservative House members. "He's a good free-market conservative."
Democrats said they were dismayed to see Republicans rallying around the proposal without offering further concessions to address Democrats' concerns.
"Republicans took a step backward today by coalescing around the Toomey plan, which Democrats have roundly rejected," a Democrat close to the negotiations said Tuesday night. "That's a troubling, worrisome sign. The door is still open; discussions will continue. But if this becomes the Republicans' last, best, final offer, they could be dooming these negotiations."
Representative Jeb Hensarling of Texas, the ranking Republican on the committee, said Republicans were not going to accept Democrats' demands for much more revenue. "We have gone as far as we feel we can go," Mr. Hensarling said on the CNBC program "The Kudlow Report."
Democrats dismissed the Republican offer last week as inadequate, saying it did not raise enough revenue and would provide a windfall to millionaires by permanently reducing the top tax rate. But Republicans said Democrats had yet to counter the Republican proposal.
One Democrat on the panel, Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, said Sunday on Fox News that his party had not "coalesced around a plan," even though the Democratic members made their first offer nearly three weeks ago, one that Republicans rejected out of hand.
But it is far from clear that unanimity exists in the Republicans' legislative world, either. Representative Eric Cantor, the majority leader, has repeatedly refused this week to endorse the Republican plan, saying that he is not acquainted with its details, even though his staff has been in several meetings and the plan was carefully presented by Mr. Hensarling, the co-chairman of the joint panel, on Tuesday at the meeting of House Republicans.
While the Capitol was abuzz with reports of new offers and serious negotiations, the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, threw cold water on hints of progress toward a deal.
"So far," Mr. Reid said, "I have not seen an indication that the Republicans are willing to agree to a balanced approach" that includes substantial new revenue and savings in entitlement programs.
Mr. Reid met Tuesday with Speaker John A. Boehner, who met later with panel Republicans and the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.
The 12-member panel, the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, has until Nov. 23 to vote on legislation to reduce future deficits by a total of $1.2 trillion over 10 years. If it falls short or if Congress does not approve its recommendations before the end of this year, automatic cuts would take effect, starting in 2013.
Republicans and some Democrats saw a possible breakthrough last week when Republicans on the committee, long hostile to new taxes, offered the proposal to raise $300 billion in new tax revenue, mainly by scaling back tax deductions for higher-income households. Mr. Reid on Tuesday appeared to minimize the significance of the offer, saying, "I don't know what the Republican proposal is."
Mr. McConnell said that "failure is not an option" for the committee, but he sounded almost as frustrated as Mr. Reid.
"The proposal laid on the table by Republicans on the joint select committee has not been countered for over a week," he said. "We're still waiting for what the Democrats might be willing to do. It's been a long week, waiting for a counterproposal."
Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, a Democratic member of the panel, said, "That's interesting," in response to Republican complaints.
"We are having continuing discussions with them," Mr. Van Hollen said.
Democrats balked Tuesday at a possible bipartisan agreement that would save tens of billions of dollars by reducing the annual cost-of-living adjustment in Social Security benefits. Senator Barbara A. Mikulski, Democrat of Maryland, denounced the idea, which has found support among some panel members of both parties. Under the proposal, the government would use a different measure of inflation to calculate the cost-of-living adjustment.
"This is not just a technical correction," Ms. Mikulski said. "It could very well have a chain reaction, pushing old people into poverty."
The proposal is based on the assumption that when the price of goods increases, consumers buy cheaper alternatives. But for older Americans, she said, health care is one of their main expenses, and they cannot easily find cheaper alternatives.
"This is not like giving up opera tickets for movie tickets," Ms. Mikulski said. "It's not like giving up a latte for Dunkin' Donuts."
But even as Democrats sounded glum, Republicans began showing a bit more optimism, based on their own party's plan.
"It seems we had a breakthrough where the Republican negotiators did put new revenue on the table," Senator Susan Collins of Maine said. "I think they deserve great credit for that, and it's my understanding that some but not all of the Democrats have put forth entitlement reforms, so that is certainly progress."

Full text: BERLIN -- Throughout the crisis in the euro zone, as governments have fallen, debt burdens have mounted and economies have stagnated or shrunk, Germany has floated above the fray. While its economy has hummed along nicely, its leaders have steadfastly insisted that the path to redemption for the debtors lies in austerity and suffering.
When Chancellor Angela Merkel on Monday described the debt crisis as Europe's "most difficult hours since World War II," she was describing something most Germans had only read about in newspapers or watched on television. The German economy once again surprised experts on Tuesday, growing an unexpectedly healthy 0.5 percent in the third quarter and 2.5 percent higher than the year before.
While there were ominous signs that Europe's slowdown would also strike Germany, its biggest economy -- particularly worrisome was a sharp drop in industrial production in September -- the pain that euro zone partners have been feeling has yet to arrive here.
With German consumers spending freely, unemployment has reached the lowest level since German reunification more than two decades ago, and it continued falling in October. Tax receipts consistently beat government projections, to the point that Mrs. Merkel's coalition even has plans to cut taxes by more than $8 billion.
And in a widely noted twist on the accounting surprises that helped cover up Greek debts, Germany recently found its own mistake in the spreadsheets: its obligations were $76 billion lower than previously thought.
Germany's continued prosperity has helped fuel growing anger in countries like Greece and Spain against what is increasingly viewed as harsh German domination. More and more, Germany is cast in the role of the villain, whether by protesters in the streets of Athens or by exasperated politicians in the halls at the recent Group of 20 meeting in Cannes, France.
"The Germans often don't sufficiently appreciate how wrenching the economic changes are that they're prescribing," said Philip Whyte, a senior research fellow at the Center for European Reform in London.
Germany, Mr. Whyte said, was trying to remake all of Europe after its competitive, export-driven economic model, without understanding the connection between its success and foreign indebtedness in countries like Greece, which for years used borrowed funds to purchase German goods.
"Not everyone can be like Germany," Mr. Whyte said. "The world as a whole doesn't trade with the moon."
European partners have taken notice of the yawning divide between their struggles and Germany's strength, and of the way German leaders have resisted aggressive measures by the European Central Bank that may have provided some relief, but may also invite what for Germans is the deep dread of inflation.
Greeks in particular have been outraged at demands for change dictated by Berlin that impinge on their sovereignty. Some Greek protesters have even carried blue European Union flags with yellow swastikas in the middle and compare the debt deals to the occupation of Greece during World War II.
The European crisis has often been likened to a morality play -- sinful southerners, virtuous northerners -- but at times in Germany it has taken the shape of Wagnerian opera, with Germany cast as the dragon guarding its hoard of gold.
Last week, Germany was awash with reports of a proposal floated at the Group of 20 meeting that might have allowed the International Monetary Fund to draw on German gold reserves to bolster Europe's rescue fund.
The condemnation was swift and disproportionately harsh for a suggestion that was basically doomed from the start. "The German gold reserves must remain untouchable," said Philipp Rosler, the economy minister and vice chancellor.
A cartoon in the newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung showed three men trying to crack a bank safe marked "Bundesbank gold and foreign currency reserves," a reference to the German central bank.
The masked man attacking the safe with a drill had the German abbreviation for the European Central Bank on his back, while the one placing the dynamite bore the letters for the International Monetary Fund. Holding a flashlight was the president of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy.
Leading politicians here defended the independence of the Bundesbank but also took the opportunity to call for Italy to sell off its own gold reserves, the fourth largest in the world after the United States, Germany and the International Monetary Fund.
"I am of the opinion that a country should do everything in its power to help itself," said Gunther Krichbaum, chairman of the committee on European affairs in the German Parliament, who spoke in favor of Italy's selling gold to help with its $2.6 trillion debt, "and in this regard Italy is far from exhausting its options."
As the overall health of Germany's economy and its fiscal position widen the rift with Europe's poorer periphery, Germans have a ready response. They say that they already made the structural changes in work-force rules and pension reforms that they are now recommending for the slow-growth countries, and that, by the way, they actually pay their taxes. So if the laggards want Germany's money, they have to play by German rules.
"We believe this success is because we have certain criteria around which we organize our economic policies, and these are the criteria we want other countries to comply with if they ask for our money," said Tanja A. Borzel, a professor of European Union politics at the Free University in Berlin. "When you put national taxpayer money on the line, the people have a say, and that is if we have to eventually pay for the economic sins of others that they at least change their policies if we bail them out."
Guntram B. Wolff, deputy director at Bruegel, a research group based in Brussels, said that as the focus in the debt crisis had shifted from the relatively small Greece to the much larger Italy, the need for domestic action versus international bailouts had risen. Mr. Wolff, who formerly worked at both the European Commission and the German Bundesbank, said that Berlin had played a more assertive role in the European crisis in part because the European Commission had not played as active a role as it could have, particularly over Italian indebtedness.
"The shift of power is clear," Mr. Wolff said, "and you see that it is Berlin that has been gaining power."

Full text: CORRECTION APPENDED
FRANKFURT -- Is it time for the European Central Bank to be as generous to countries as it is to banks?
Since the beginning of the financial crisis, the central bank has been lending euro area banks as much money as they want, trying to maintain the liquidity -- or continual flow of money -- that is the lifeblood of the global financial system.
But because the central bank has refused to offer the same easy lending service to countries like Italy and Spain, it is not confronting the euro area's most fundamental problem -- a sell-off of debt from the troubled countries that is pushing their borrowing costs to dangerous levels.
Investors pushed up interest rates on Italy's debt to record-high levels last week during the political crisis there. And even Monday, after the supposedly calming effect of a new, technocratic prime minister in Rome, lenders were demanding that Italy pay interest rates at levels high enough to eventually bankrupt the country.
In an auction of five-year bonds, Italy had to pay a rate of 6.29 percent, compared with 5.32 percent at a similar auction a month ago.
And Italy's 10-year bonds, which crested well above 7 percent last week in the secondary market, were still dangerously high on Monday, at 6.77 percent -- more than three times what Germany must pay on comparable bonds. In a further sign of investor anxiety about the weaker links in the euro chain, Spanish 10-year bond yields rose above 6 percent for the first time since August.
It is an atmosphere of mistrust reminiscent of the aftermath of the Lehman Brothers collapse in 2008. European banks are demanding higher interest rates for the overnight lending to one another that is essential to keep money circulating.
Still, banks are feeling the pressure to reduce costs and raise capital in the face of Europe's sovereign debt crisis. UniCredit, the largest Italian bank, said on Monday that it would raise $10.3 billion and eliminate 5,200 jobs in Italy over the next few years as part of a strategic overhaul.
Some banks have even gone so far as to refuse to make overnight loans to other banks at all, fearing others' vulnerability to the debt of Italy, Spain and other beleaguered countries. For that reason, the central bank has been willing to lend to the banks as needed.
But the biggest fear -- the one implicit in all the talk of "contagion" and a potential "Lehman moment" -- is not that any one bank will succumb to a liquidity crisis. It is that an entire country might do so, if it can no longer obtain the credit it requires to stay in business.
And at least so far, the central bank has not done the one thing that could help calm that fear: declare that it stands ready to be the de facto lender of last resort to national governments.
If the fear that sent Italy's borrowing costs to record highs last week becomes a chronic condition, the country could lose the liquidity it needs to keep paying the holders of its 1.9 trillion euro ($2.6 trillion) debt. That would be the Italy Moment -- the point at which Rome's liquidity problem would quickly become everyone else's.
"We are approaching the point where the E.C.B. has to show its hand and accept its role as a lender of last resort," analysts at Credit Suisse said in a note to clients Friday. "The question is how much further turmoil is required for it to do so."
Mario Draghi, the new president of the European Central Bank, which is based here in Frankfurt, has insisted that countries must help themselves by cutting spending and taking steps to make their economies more competitive.
Jens Weidmann, president of the German Bundesbank and an influential member of the central bank's governing council, went further Monday, saying it would be illegal to use the central bank to solve government budget problems.
"The increasing demand being placed on monetary policy is dangerous," Mr. Weidmann told an audience of bankers in Frankfurt. "Monetary policy cannot and may not solve the solvency problems of governments and banks."
What the markets want to hear, though, is not only prescriptions for long-term overhauls but also assurances that the central bank will do whatever it takes to prevent a near-term panic.
Italy, unlike Greece, is solvent, in that it has the economic resources to manage its debts. That is why many economists say it makes sense to protect Italy from a temporary inability to meet its cash-flow obligations. And with marketplace trust being a top component of getting access to money, the reassurance that the central bank stood ready to step in as a lender to governments might be enough to keep the central bank from having to actually take that action.
But as long as worry continues that Italy may not be able to service its debt, Italian bonds are losing value as interbank currency -- a big disadvantage for banks in Italy or France that own tens of billions in Italian debt. Last Tuesday, LCH Clearnet, a company that acts as an intermediary in bond and other trading, said it would impose a steeper discount on Italian bonds used as collateral.
As a central bank, the E.C.B. could theoretically use its ability to print money to buy huge amounts of debt from Italy and other countries. That would drive down their borrowing costs and ensure that they could continue to service their debts -- that they would remain liquid, in other words.
The central bank's charter does not allow it to buy bonds directly from national treasuries. And yet, the central bank can and does do essentially the same thing, by buying government bonds on the open market.
Since last year, the bank has spent 187 billion euros intervening in bond markets. But the relatively modest sums, less than 10 percent of the central bank's total balance sheet, have not been enough to prevent yields on Italian bonds from rising.
If the interest rates that Italy must pay to borrow remain at their current levels, the government could eventually go bankrupt.
The only limit to the central bank's ability to create money is a psychological one -- the fear of setting off too much inflation. Mainstream economists, though, do not see any risk of significant inflation under current circumstances. The euro area is headed for recession, unemployment is rising and factories are not producing as much as they could. That is why economists tend to encourage the bank to put more money into circulation.
Mr. Draghi seems to be in agreement on at least the point that inflation is not a big threat right now, which is why his first act as the bank's president was to announce a cut in short-term interest rates.
But if the central bank were to step up its bond buying, it would continue to encounter the shrill opposition of Germany, which has a fear of inflation steeped in history. And Berlin's voice on such matters is hard for Mr. Draghi to ignore, as German financial support is essential to the survival of the euro area.
Correction: November 16, 2011, Wednesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A news analysis article on Tuesday about bond-buying by the European Central Bank misstated the practices of the United States Federal Reserve, the American central bank. The Fed buys bonds on the open market; it does not buy directly from the United States Treasury.

Full text: New claims for jobless benefits in the United States fell last week to their lowest level since early April and the country's trade deficit unexpectedly shrank in September, pointing to a slight improvement in the sluggish economy.
The Labor Department said on Thursday that initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell for the second consecutive week, dropping 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 390,000.
That is still well above levels from before the 2007-9 recession, but economists say a level below 400,000 could prompt some acceleration in hiring.
"Clearly, the labor market is improving, but at a very slow pace," said Omer Esiner, chief market strategist at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington.
In a separate report, the Commerce Department said that the country's trade deficit shrank 4 percent, to $43.1 billion, in September.
The gap was the narrowest since December because of record-high exports, and it suggested that the United States economy closed the third quarter a little stronger than previously thought.
The government could raise its estimate for third-quarter growth to a 2.8 percent annual rate from 2.5 percent, said Paul Dales, an economist at Capital Economics in Toronto.
Still, economists say the economy must grow much faster to put a big dent in the jobless rate, which has been stuck at or above 9 percent for most of the last two years.
The data "are not strong enough to make it clear that we are in a solid recovery but they are not weak enough to show that we are falling into a recession," said Rick Meckler, president of the investment firm LibertyView Capital Management in New York.
While companies are cutting back on layoffs, they are not increasing hiring much. Nonfarm payrolls rose a tepid 80,000 last month, the government said last week.
The trade report also showed a narrowing of the politically sensitive deficit with China. China has allowed its currency to appreciate 4.3 percent over the last year as it tries to rebalance its economy so that it depends more on domestic consumption and less on exports.
The United States data showed Chinese imports fell 2.5 percent in September. A report in Beijing showed the country's imports surged in October as exports grew at their slowest rate in months.
Still, the United States and other countries are pressing China to let the renminbi strengthen more, and many of the Republican candidates campaigning for the White House have vowed to put more pressure on China.
A separate report showing a 0.6 percent fall in import prices during October also painted a bright spot for the economy.
Americans' wages have not kept up with high inflation in recent months, making it harder for consumers to step up spending and power the economy. Many analysts, however, think inflation may have peaked.

Abstract: The Senate overwhelmingly approved two elements of President Obama's jobs bill on Thursday as members of a Congressional committee on deficit reduction struggled to overcome bitter partisan disputes over how much to raise taxes. "What we still haven't seen from the Democrats is a plan that deals with our structural debt crisis that actually solves the problem, and unfortunately we've never seen any reforms that would save and secure our health care programs that weren't attached to a trillion dollars worth of tax increase," Mr. Hensarling said.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Senate overwhelmingly approved two elements of President Obama's jobs bill on Thursday as members of a Congressional committee on deficit reduction struggled to overcome bitter partisan disputes over how much to raise taxes.
The impasse on deficit reduction -- less than two weeks before the deadline for the committee to complete its work -- caused alarm and anxiety among senators from both parties.
Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts and a member of the committee, said the debt crisis in Europe added urgency to Congressional efforts to reduce the deficit here.
"Given the opportunity," Mr. Kerry said, "the committee has to send a message about the U.S. financial situation. I personally think it is a very important component, or should be a very important component, of our thinking."
In the last month, the Senate has rejected three versions of Mr. Obama's jobs bill. But on Thursday it approved a measure with two elements of the White House plan. One would offer tax credits to companies that hire unemployed veterans. The other would repeal a law that requires federal, state and local government agencies to deduct and withhold 3 percent of payments they make to many contractors. The bill goes back to the House, which passed a similar measure last month.
Senator Jon Tester, Democrat of Montana, called it "the most significant piece of veterans' jobs legislation" in several years.
Senator Scott P. Brown, Republican of Massachusetts, said the 95-to-0 vote on passage of the bill showed that the two parties could sometimes work together.
But lawmakers saw little evidence of such cooperation in the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, which is supposed to vote on its final recommendations by Nov. 23.
A co-chairman of the committee, Representative Jeb Hensarling, Republican of Texas, broke his silence on the panel's internal deliberations on Thursday and assailed Democrats as intransigent.
Mr. Hensarling said that Republicans had made "a major concession" by proposing tax increases, and he asserted that Democrats had not reciprocated by proposing major cuts in the growth of benefits programs like Medicare and Medicaid.
"What we still haven't seen from the Democrats is a plan that deals with our structural debt crisis that actually solves the problem, and unfortunately we've never seen any reforms that would save and secure our health care programs that weren't attached to a trillion dollars worth of tax increase," Mr. Hensarling said. Such a tax increase "is ultimately going to harm job growth," he added.
Democrats rejected the criticism and called on Republicans to accept more tax revenue as part of any agreement.
Senator Kent Conrad, Democrat of North Dakota, praised Republicans for moving off their long-held position opposing any tax increases.
"It is significant," Mr. Conrad said. "It is moving in the right direction." But, he asserted, Republicans need to accept more tax revenue as part of any deal.
Democrats objected to part of the latest Republican proposal that they said would provide huge tax breaks to the most affluent Americans.
"The Republican plan would provide the largest percentage tax cut for multimillionaires since Calvin Coolidge was in the White House," said a Democratic aide close to the negotiations.
Senators from both parties expressed dismay at the possibility that the joint committee would fail, forcing automatic across-the-board cuts in spending.
That would be "the worst outcome," said Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri. "It really means you couldn't make any choices."
Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut, said: "If the supercommittee fails, there will be an immediate effect on the markets, including the stock market. I would not be surprised if some time shortly thereafter there would be a downgrading of our financial rating. And there could be a kind of grass-roots uprising in the Senate to bring some bipartisan deficit reduction program to the floor right away in December."
Several Republicans suggested that their position on revenues was more flexible than Republican members of the committee had assumed.
"If the select committee were able to come up with a proposal that did bring in new revenue that was going to be good for the country," and if the proposal also included changes in entitlement programs, "I would support it, I would absolutely support it," said Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska.
"We have gotten ourselves into such a fear that if there is one new dollar of tax revenue, somehow or other we are not Republican enough," Ms. Murkowski said. "This is not about Republicans or Democrats or anyone in between. This is about the economic well-being of our country."
Several Democrats said they were offended by Mr. Hensarling's characterization of the party's position on benefit programs.
"I am for entitlement reform," said Senator Mary L. Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana. "Go ask Republicans where they are on revenues."
Senator Michael Bennet, Democrat of Colorado, said, "There are plenty of Democrats who have said that entitlement reforms need to be part of this equation."
AARP, the lobby for older Americans, sent letters to all committee members opposing a change that would reduce the annual cost-of-living adjustment for Social Security, by using an alternative measure of inflation.
Democrats and Republicans on the panel have proposed such a change. But AARP said the change would "take billions of dollars out of the pockets of beneficiaries." Benefit reductions would be compounded over time, so that older and poorer retirees would see larger cuts in benefits, the group said.

Abstract: [...] investors and analysts say, the very depth and sophistication of Italy's 1.9 trillion euro ($2.6 trillion) bond market, the third-largest in the world after the United States and Japan, has made it a proxy of sorts for the euro zone's deeper problems. According to officials at Eurex, Europe's main derivatives exchange, the market for Italian bond futures has increased substantially of late, to as much as one billion euros a day.

Full text: LONDON -- A day after panicky investors drove Italian bond rates well above 7 percent, reviving fears that the euro zone was heading toward a break-up, the market calmed somewhat on Thursday after Italy managed to attract strong buying interest for a shorter-term bond offering. Also helping buoy the market were rumors that the European Central Bank had stepped up its purchase of Italian bonds.
But a calmer market should not be confused with an optimistic one. Investors are still deeply worried about Italy's mounting political and debt financing woes.
Even the seeming rallying point on Thursday -- Italy's ability to sell out an offering of 5 billion euros in one-year bonds -- had a dark side. The interest rate was 6 percent, up from 3.5 percent only a month ago.
In fact, investors and analysts say, the very depth and sophistication of Italy's 1.9 trillion euro ($2.6 trillion) bond market, the third-largest in the world after the United States and Japan, has made it a proxy of sorts for the euro zone's deeper problems. Those include the possible exit of Greece from the euro and Germany's resistance to assuming a larger financial burden in rescuing weaker economies.
Investors have been dumping Italian bonds that they own, and ramping up their negative bets by selling Italian bond futures as well.
The Italian bond market is the only large market in the euro zone outside of Germany to offer investors the ability to buy or sell futures contracts. That has allowed many investors to use Italian futures to place bearish bets on Italy, and as a proxy for the broader euro zone itself.
"The futures market for Italian bonds has become the main conduit now for all investor angst with regard to the euro zone," said Yra Harris, a trader at Praxis Trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
In what has become a highly volatile trading environment, investor fears can shift sharply, turning sellers into buyers, especially if it becomes clear that the European Central Bank has started buying bonds. That is why, after Italian 10-year yields touched a dangerously high level of 7.4 percent on Wednesday, word that the bank had started buying the bonds sent yields as low as 6.7 percent on Thursday.
Market jitters were also calmed by indications that Italy was moving closer to appointing a new government with a revamped legislative initiative, making it more likely that the European Central Bank will follow through with additional Italian bond purchases. And further soothing came from the resolution of the Greek political drama, with the appointment of Lucas Papademos, the former vice president of the European Central Bank, as the country's new prime minister.
Still, European officials are keeping the pressure on Italy. At a news conference Thursday, Olli Rehn, the European Union commissioner for economic and monetary affairs, insisted that Italy's meeting its fiscal targets and adopting structural reforms was a "sine qua non for restoring confidence in the Italian economy."
At the root of this confidence drain is the substantial size of debt that Italy must raise from local and foreign investors next year alone: about 350 billion euros. That is about the size of Greece's total debt.
Over the years, Italy has become a very efficient debt-raising machine, with more than 50 percent of its financing needs met by local banks and investors.
But a substantial amount still must come from foreign investors, which in the past have largely been major European banks. Now these banks are selling their positions to avoid the prospect of having to book losses from their reduced value. And if they are continuing to participate in new bond auctions, as with Thursday's one-year offering, they are demanding much higher interest rates.
Meanwhile, the negative betting continues. According to officials at Eurex, Europe's main derivatives exchange, the market for Italian bond futures has increased substantially of late, to as much as one billion euros a day. That is more or less the same size as the market for buying and selling Italian bonds directly.
Many people entering into these futures trades are doing it for hedging purposes or to protect their portfolios if Italy defaults.
But as broader worries about Greece are added to the concern that Italy may no longer be able to finance its debt burden, traders have started to sell Italian bond futures directly -- a bet that the euro zone itself might collapse and that Italian bonds will continue to lose value.
Despite all the bad news, those negative bets remain a very risky undertaking. Analysts point to the fact that the European Central Bank still has considerable firepower and can move markets sharply by buying Italian bonds, as it did Thursday. But the purchases have been small compared with the total debt outstanding, and some say they believe the bank should publicly commit to buying far more, or even to back Italy's entire debt.
There is disagreement, however, over whether the bank will be allowed to drastically step up its bond purchases. The central bank's charter requires it to focus on price stability in Europe, not an individual sovereign market's stability.
Some argue that the central bank should not be diverting its view from its main purpose, but others say the purchases are clearly allowed. There is a provision of the governing treaty that allows the central bank to buy or sell market instruments if it furthers the bank's primary mission of maintaining price stability.
James Savage, a fellow at the United States Institute of Peace and author of a book about the creation of the euro zone, said there is no cap on how far the central bank can go under that provision, and he said he could see it allowing the bank to back Italy's bond market, if needed.
"There's no prohibition; there's no level; there's no constraint," Mr. Savage said. "If price stability is your goal, it's really a matter of how you can argue that your policies are leading to that outcome."
As it purchases government bonds, the central bank has been taking steps to try to remove any possibility of causing inflation through that action. The bank has taken in greater deposits from banks alongside its bond purchases, though it is not clear the bank needs to do that to justify further purchases.
If European officials concluded that the central bank could not substantially increase its role in Italy without a change in its mission, that would require approval from each member of the European Union, undoubtedly a slow and possibly politically unfeasible process.
Economists also emphasize that, if the amount of interest Italy pays on its debt is excluded, the country is running not a deficit but a surplus, one that is expected to be 2.5 percent of gross domestic product in 2012, the highest of any major developed economy.
But the positive spin goes only so far.
In the view of Peter Bofinger, a German economist who advises the finance ministry in Berlin, the longer Germany insists on segregating the debts and deficits of individual euro area countries as opposed to adding them all together across the euro zone, the sooner such distinctions will become meaningless. "When Italian interest rates go above 7 percent, that turns a liquidity crisis into a solvency crisis," he said. In other words, if rates continue to increase, Italy might have to exit the debt markets as Greece and Ireland did, and resort to a bailout.
"Europe either stands united and survives," he said, "or stays divided and falls."

Full text: Regulation and Housing Crisis
There is a basic problem with the argument, made by several candidates, that the government forced mortgage lenders to make bad loans: most subprime loans were made by companies that were not subject to any kind of federal regulation.
Furthermore, there was no need for force. Financial companies jumped into the market. The major investment banks lined up to purchase subprime lenders, the major retail banks created subprime-lending divisions and a generation of upstart subprime lenders like Ameriquest and Countrywide were briefly celebrated as rising stars of American business.
No executive of a major mortgage company said at the time that the government was forcing him to make subprime loans. The executives said they did it because they thought they'd make money. And even now, after the crash, with all the temptation to point figures, it is awfully hard to find a mortgage executive who echoes the argument of the Republican candidates.
Studies of the financial crisis do assign a significant measure of responsibility to the government, but mostly for its failure to regulate these lenders.
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-backed mortgage finance companies, did provide financing for large numbers of subprime loans, mostly by purchasing mortgage securities for their investment portfolios. But the historical record shows that they came late, diving into subprime lending because private companies were stealing their business and profits. As such, most experts have concluded that Fannie and Freddie helped expand the bubble but did not create it.
- Binyamin Appelbaum
Regulation and Business
Herman Cain suggested that the chief problem holding back companies was regulatory uncertainty. Other candidates, including Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, have made similar claims about regulatory burdens.
But if you look at surveys of small businesses conducted by the National Federation of Independent Business, a plurality of companies consistently say that the "single biggest problem" they face is low sales, not red tape or taxes.
The Labor Department's data on mass layoffs echo this finding. For the last three quarters, "governmental regulations/intervention" have accounted for fewer than 1 percent of layoffs.
As for hiring, one reason to believe that lack of consumer demand, rather than regulations, is discouraging employers is that businesses are not even fully using their existing staff and equipment. If regulatory requirements were so burdensome but the demand was there, you'd think that companies would at least step up their use of what they already had on hand.
But the average length of the workweek is still shorter than it was before the recession began, and has been basically flat since the start of this year.
Additionally, as pointed out by Jan Eberly, assistant Treasury secretary, companies are letting their industrial resources lie fallow rather than running everything at full capacity.
"The share of total potential industrial output in use remains 3 percent below its long-run average," she writes. "Low-capacity utilization is inconsistent with concerns about future regulatory risk, but aligns with weak demand holding back current production."
- Catherine Rampell
Who Pays Federal Taxes
Representative Michele Bachmann points out that 47 percent of Americans pay no federal income taxes. She is unusual among the candidates in using such specific numbers, and once again, the number itself is correct.
But many of those same people are subject to federal payroll taxes, meaning that Uncle Sam still gets a portion of their paycheck -- not to mention the fact that many pay state and local taxes.
The Times's David Leonhardt, analyzing data from the Congressional Budget Office, estimated that "at most, 10 percent of all households pay no net federal taxes."
It's also important to mention the primary reason people don't pay taxes: poverty.
- Binyamin Appelbaum
Paul on Inflation
In one of his standard attacks on the Federal Reserve, Representative Ron Paul said the recent increase in the money supply "spells inflation" in the near future.
So far, at least, markets do not agree.
Analyzing survey responses and market data on Treasuries and other securities, the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland estimates that the public expects the inflation rate to be less than 2 percent on average over the next decade.
- Catherine Rampell
Corporate Tax Rate
Mrs. Bachmann described the United States' corporate tax rate as the second-highest in the world. That's true, at least among the major economies. Only Japan has a higher top tax rate for corporations.
But it's also true that a bevy of loopholes significantly reduces the actual burden. As a result, the share of income that American corporations pay in taxes sits right about on the average for large economies. And a 2008 study by the Congressional Budget Office found that 55 percent of corporations had paid no taxes in at least one year of a seven-year study period.
It should be noted that many tax experts believe that it would make more sense -- and help the economy -- to lower the stated tax rates for corporations and at the same time reduce the number of exemptions, collecting the same amount of revenue in a more equitable manner.

Abstract: While many businesses in the United States struggle to stay afloat and workers collect unemployment checks, China has the opposite problem: an economy, pumped up by expansive lending by state-controlled banks, which is growing too fast to keep inflation and speculation in check. The central government has set stringent though undisclosed limits on how much money each bank can lend, clamped down on real estate speculation by limiting the number of mortgages allowed for each citizen and begun cracking down on many forms of semilegal and illegal lending.

Full text: GUANGZHOU, China -- David Huan had big dreams for his business, a factory in central China that makes picture frames ranging from glossy wood to the gilded and baroque. He wanted to expand production, and add new equipment and 400 to 600 workers atop the 400 he already employed.
The demand was there last spring, he said on a recent afternoon. But his bankers weren't. They balked at lending him money to buy equipment -- and today his export-oriented business is about where it was six months ago.
"I feel like I'm walking in place," he said.
He has lots of company. While many businesses in the United States struggle to stay afloat and workers collect unemployment checks, China has the opposite problem: an economy, pumped up by expansive lending by state-controlled banks, which is growing too fast to keep inflation and speculation in check.
Beijing's solution: Create an artificial shortage of credit. The central government has set stringent though undisclosed limits on how much money each bank can lend, clamped down on real estate speculation by limiting the number of mortgages allowed for each citizen and begun cracking down on many forms of semilegal and illegal lending. After months of steady tightening, the controls have finally begun to bite into inflation, business growth, real estate prices and lending.
Lending by Chinese banks jumped 32.5 percent in 2009 in inflation-adjusted terms. That growth slowed to 13.3 percent in 2010 and 7.3 percent in the first nine months of this year. Lending to small businesses has grown slightly faster. But there are so many small businesses and they are expanding so quickly that competition for these loans is especially fierce and difficult, said Nicholas R. Lardy, an economist at the Peter G. Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.
The policy makers' principal goal is to tamp down inflation, which has played a repeated role in causing social unrest, including during the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. Despite a goal of limiting inflation to no more than 4 percent a year, prices have stubbornly remained about 6 percent higher this autumn than a year ago for consumers based on official gauges -- and up to twice that by the estimate of many private economists.
The worst of the credit squeeze this year has compelled at least a few business people to flee the country or even commit suicide. They did so after borrowing money at usurious rates of up to 5 percent a month -- an 80 percent annual rate -- from loan sharks or neighborhood lending pools and then finding that their speculative investments with the money did not pay off.
But the credit squeeze is far broader. In more than a dozen recent interviews at the Canton Fair here, the country's largest export trade fair, every business owner or sales manager described increasing difficulties in borrowing money -- as well as strategies that banks and borrowers alike are using to cushion the effect of the new lending restrictions.
Some banks are requiring lenders to personally guarantee corporate loans and put up considerably more land and factory equipment as collateral. Others lend money only if borrowers agree to redeposit up to half of the loan in the same bank at a much lower interest rate. The practical effect is that the borrower pays a much higher interest rate than the official, heavily regulated interest rate for loans, usually 7 or 8 percent.
"If the bank lends you one million, they ask for 500,000 back as a deposit," said Elaine Yan, the import and export manager at the Wuxi Zontai International Corporation, a trading company specializing in brightly colored shower curtains and bath mats. The company has decided not to borrow money at all, meeting its modest financing needs through retained profits.
Daunted by such terms, Helen Huang, the owner of a company producing chrome-plated paperweights, turned to a neighborhood lending pool last year. The $3.1 million she borrowed helped finance a $7.9 million land purchase so her company, the Shijiazhuang Harmony Import and Export Company, could build a factory.
The lending pool, run by friends, charged only 7 percent a year, she said -- similar to what a bank loan would have been, but without onerous paperwork or redeposit requirements. The friends were seeking to earn more than the meager, regulated interest paid on bank deposits, currently 3.5 percent for a one-year certificate of deposit -- a rate so low that, with 6 percent inflation, bank deposits actually lose buying power.
China has a long tradition of such family-and-friend lending pools, which finance many entrepreneurial businesses whose creditworthiness may be hard for banks to assess. The legality of these pools is murky and depends partly on the extent to which they rely on new deposits to help pay interest to earlier investors.
With banks restricted from lending, businesses are taking different tacks to raise money. Some ask customers to make larger deposits when they place orders, for example, so that the factories can use the cash to pay for raw materials.
"I do try to ask for more deposits upfront, but customers are resistant," said Ms. Huang, the paperweight maker.
The government's tight grip on lending is producing results: Consumer inflation is slowly subsiding by official measures, to 6.1 percent in September from a peak of 6.5 percent in July. But in its place, one new concern is whether state planners have tightened too much.
Beyond slowing factory expansions, the lending curbs have hit real estate developers particularly hard, said Stephen Green, the chief China analyst for Standard Chartered Bank. Many speculators, betting on ever-rising land prices, have parked their money in newly built offices or apartments that are largely vacant.
With credit scarce, some are unable to roll over the loans used to build the developments. While well-financed developers are barely cutting prices, weaker developers have begun quietly discounting new apartments by up to 30 percent in the last month; the latest official figures for changes in real estate prices were not yet available. Others may be forced to sell or rent property at a deep discount, winding up underwater, like some American homeowners.
Cooling off land speculation was a major goal of the government's tightening, Mr. Green said. But if the credit tightening isn't carefully calibrated, he added, it could hit both developers and the economy too hard.
"I think generally the economy is showing signs of sand in the wheels -- it's beginning to slow things down," he said of the tightening measures. "If it turns out to be a macro problem, that's one of the things that will cause the government to loosen policy sooner."
And in fact, there are hints of just that. The State Council, China's cabinet, said in late October that it would experiment with lowering the value-added tax, which is typically 17 percent, at least for service businesses, potentially putting more money into circulation. Premier Wen Jiabao also signaled some relaxation, saying late last month that planners would eventually "fine-tune" policies to ensure adequate growth in credit and the money supply.
While many business people are dismayed by the scant availability of credit, they are also painfully aware of inflation. Rapid economic growth has exposed shortages, particularly labor shortages, and sent prices soaring.
Ms. Huang, the paperweight maker, said that pay for skilled workers who can operate chrome-plating equipment had doubled just in the last year, to $630 a month. Even with that increase, she has so much trouble finding workers that orders received last month will not be filled until March, she said.
Demand is surging even for unskilled workers in interior provinces far from the prosperous coast. Mr. Huan said that competition for labor from other businesses had forced his company, Tennon Frame in Luoyang, a city in inland Henan Province, to raise wages this year to $150 a month before overtime and benefits, compared with $95 a month early last year.
"It's crazy -- China is going crazy," he said.

Abstract: [...] progress in solar panels has been so dramatic and sustained that, as a blog post at Scientific American put it, "there's now frequent talk of a 'Moore's law' in solar energy," with prices adjusted for inflation falling around 7 percent a year.\n

Full text: For decades the story of technology has been dominated, in the popular mind and to a large extent in reality, by computing and the things you can do with it. Moore's Law -- in which the price of computing power falls roughly 50 percent every 18 months -- has powered an ever-expanding range of applications, from faxes to Facebook.
Our mastery of the material world, on the other hand, has advanced much more slowly. The sources of energy, the way we move stuff around, are much the same as they were a generation ago.
But that may be about to change. We are, or at least we should be, on the cusp of an energy transformation, driven by the rapidly falling cost of solar power. That's right, solar power.
If that surprises you, if you still think of solar power as some kind of hippie fantasy, blame our fossilized political system, in which fossil fuel producers have both powerful political allies and a powerful propaganda machine that denigrates alternatives.
Speaking of propaganda: Before I get to solar, let's talk briefly about hydraulic fracturing, a k a fracking.
Fracking -- injecting high-pressure fluid into rocks deep underground, inducing the release of fossil fuels -- is an impressive technology. But it's also a technology that imposes large costs on the public. We know that it produces toxic (and radioactive) wastewater that contaminates drinking water; there is reason to suspect, despite industry denials, that it also contaminates groundwater; and the heavy trucking required for fracking inflicts major damage on roads.
Economics 101 tells us that an industry imposing large costs on third parties should be required to "internalize" those costs -- that is, to pay for the damage it inflicts, treating that damage as a cost of production. Fracking might still be worth doing given those costs. But no industry should be held harmless from its impacts on the environment and the nation's infrastructure.
Yet what the industry and its defenders demand is, of course, precisely that it be let off the hook for the damage it causes. Why? Because we need that energy! For example, the industry-backed organization energyfromshale.org declares that "there are only two sides in the debate: those who want our oil and natural resources developed in a safe and responsible way; and those who don't want our oil and natural gas resources developed at all."
So it's worth pointing out that special treatment for fracking makes a mockery of free-market principles. Pro-fracking politicians claim to be against subsidies, yet letting an industry impose costs without paying compensation is in effect a huge subsidy. They say they oppose having the government "pick winners," yet they demand special treatment for this industry precisely because they claim it will be a winner.
And now for something completely different: the success story you haven't heard about.
These days, mention solar power and you'll probably hear cries of "Solyndra!" Republicans have tried to make the failed solar panel company both a symbol of government waste -- although claims of a major scandal are nonsense -- and a stick with which to beat renewable energy.
But Solyndra's failure was actually caused by technological success: the price of solar panels is dropping fast, and Solyndra couldn't keep up with the competition. In fact, progress in solar panels has been so dramatic and sustained that, as a blog post at Scientific American put it, "there's now frequent talk of a 'Moore's law' in solar energy," with prices adjusted for inflation falling around 7 percent a year.
This has already led to rapid growth in solar installations, but even more change may be just around the corner. If the downward trend continues -- and if anything it seems to be accelerating -- we're just a few years from the point at which electricity from solar panels becomes cheaper than electricity generated by burning coal.
And if we priced coal-fired power right, taking into account the huge health and other costs it imposes, it's likely that we would already have passed that tipping point.
But will our political system delay the energy transformation now within reach?
Let's face it: a large part of our political class, including essentially the entire G.O.P., is deeply invested in an energy sector dominated by fossil fuels, and actively hostile to alternatives. This political class will do everything it can to ensure subsidies for the extraction and use of fossil fuels, directly with taxpayers' money and indirectly by letting the industry off the hook for environmental costs, while ridiculing technologies like solar.
So what you need to know is that nothing you hear from these people is true. Fracking is not a dream come true; solar is now cost-effective. Here comes the sun, if we're willing to let it in.

Full text: SURELY they could spare a little milk, right?
But when John and Mary Rose Lin of Jersey City ran out of milk for their 18-month-old twins on a recent Continental flight from Newark to Maui, the flight attendant onboard refused to give them more. That particular beverage, the Lins recall being told, was for coffee, not children. "I was not asking for a full bottle, just a cup," said Mrs. Lin, noting that she even offered to pay for the milk.
It was the low point of an otherwise arduous trip. Her children are active, and efforts to allow them to move around the cabin were not welcomed by the plane's staff. They were told to head back to their seats when they lingered near the rear galley; letting the children stretch their legs in the aisle was also not an option. "Not a lot of people sympathize with your situation," said Mrs. Lin of the 12-hour ordeal. "If you feel like someone is going to help you, chances are no one will."
The misery of air travel is no surprise to anyone who has boarded a domestic flight in the last five years. As airlines have maximized capacity and slashed services, passengers have learned to brace themselves for packed planes, stuffed overhead bins, harried flight attendants and fees for everything from pretzels to pillows. On top of that, delays and cancellations are up.
For families, however, the costs and the inconveniences are compounded. At a time when resorts, cruise lines and tour operators are courting junior guests as if they were celebrity V.I.P.'s, flying with children has become an increasingly costly, "Survivor"-like ordeal. Baggage fees? Start multiplying. Early boarding? Probably not. Hoping to sit together? Don't count on it (unless you've paid extra). A few empty seats where a child can spread out and nap? Good luck with that!
It wasn't always like this, of course. In the golden age of flying in the 1960s and '70s -- the one now being so lovingly burnished by ABC's "Pan Am" -- families could expect to be the first ones on the plane. They would then be greeted by smiling flight attendants bearing miniature pilot wings for children who would be treated to a tour of the cockpit before settling into their seats. And even as recently as a few years ago families could count on a handful of common courtesies like boarding before other passengers, landing a roomier seat in the first row of coach, bringing certain strollers on board, and even being able to get milk on board.
"We used to carry five to six cartons of milk on each flight for coach," said Elaine Sweeney, 58, a flight attendant with American for more than 30 years. But that was five or so years ago. Now, she said, after 9 a.m. there is no milk in coach on her flights -- just two pint-size cartons in first class, where cookies are served. "So do we give it to a child in coach or a first-class passenger that has paid full fare?" she asked. "Quite the conundrum." (American, by the way, says it stocks food and beverages based on individual markets.)
To traveling families, the erosion of such niceties is just an indirect way of suggesting they take the bus.
Not so, counter the airlines, it's a matter of resources. American carriers have lost about $55 billion over the course of the past decade, according to the Air Transport Association, as operational costs, like fuel and employee benefits, have outpaced revenues. Making up for those losses has meant cutting benefits and adding fees for everyone. (This year, most domestic airlines are on track to eke out their fourth year of modest profits since 2000.)
And while we may miss the golden days of air travel, flights cost less now than they did then. Adjusting for inflation, the average round-trip domestic fare in 1979 was $559.31; last year it was $316.31. For families, in particular, that is a meaningful difference. More than anything else, said Michael Boyd, president of the Boyd Group International, an aviation consultancy, "families generally travel based on price."
Given the current economic climate and families' desire for cheap flights, Mr. Boyd doesn't expect things to improve soon. At best, he said, airlines "treat families like everybody else."
"If you get a good flight attendant they might help you warm the bottle," he continued. "Other than that you're on your own."
So for anyone planning to brave the indifferent skies with children this season, here are a few of the major sticking points and tips on how to navigate them.
Why Is Everyone Else
Boarding First?
As little as four years ago, some airlines were still routinely calling families to board first. The idea was that getting children on early was not just a courtesy for families -- who got extra time to settle in -- but a benefit that improved boarding for everyone. The policy has been declining over several years, and now, with early boarding a privilege people can pay for, it is rare to find someone who has been invited to board first as part of a family. (Airline representatives all say that they allow families to board, if not first, then at least before coach passengers paying regular fare, but anecdotal reporting suggests otherwise.)
WHAT FAMILIES CAN DO The only way to guarantee early boarding for your family is to buy it. Check with the airline to see what they offer. Short of that, explain to the gate agents why you would like to preboard and see if they can help. If necessary, refer to their preboarding policies (see accompanying article) for backup. Or give up any hope of using your overhead bin and board last with the idea of keeping restlessness to a minimum.
My Kids Are Seated
Five Rows Behind Me!
Planes are flying mostly full most of the time thanks to major capacity cuts over the past decade; during peak travel times empty seats are even harder to come by. For families this means that it is increasingly difficult to get seats together, a particular gripe for those who, like Sierra Black, have found themselves jockeying for seats onboard.
Last February, US Airways placed Ms. Black and her two children, ages 5 and 2, in the center seats of three different rows in different parts of the plane for a five-hour flight to Tucson -- an experience Ms. Black chronicled in a series on her blog, ChildWild. After a flight attendant insisted that the family take their assigned seats -- which caused the children to cry since they were separated from their mother and sitting between strangers -- Ms. Black ultimately managed to commandeer seats for the three of them together, but only after the entire plane had boarded.
"Even if I wanted to leave my 2-yr-old in row 26 while I kicked back with a paperback up in row 5, I kind of think I shouldn't be allowed to," Ms. Black wrote on her blog. "Doesn't the airline have a responsibility, for the safety of all its passengers, to keep young kids with their caregivers?"
Responding, Todd Lehmacher, a US Airways spokesman, wrote in an e-mail, "We are sympathetic to families traveling together and make every effort to accommodate their request." But, he added, "We also have to weigh the needs of our other customers."
When flights were less full, flight attendants say, reseating passengers so that a family could sit together wasn't a problem. Now, if any open seats are left at all, they are usually the middle ones, making it difficult to persuade other passengers to swap seats -- a task flight attendants are not required to do.
WHAT FAMILIES CAN DO First, book as early as possible so more seats are available. If you cannot find seats together, call the airline and ask an agent to make a note on your reservation indicating which family members are minors, recommends Henry H. Harteveldt, a travel industry analyst and co-founder of Atmosphere Research Group, based in San Francisco. "If for some reason the airline changes planes or the seating configuration changes," he said, "families usually get priority."
If nothing comes of that, check back with the airline one to three days before departure, when seats for customers with disabilities are often released. If those seats are not taken, they are released to other passengers.
And, of course, you can throw money at the problem. Most airlines now put a price tag on the most desirable seats, which may remain available when the rest of coach is sold.
"It's almost like you're forced into it," said Carla Caccavale Reynolds, a public relations executive from New York and mother of four, who paid $70 extra a head for herself, her husband and three of her children to sit together on a packed JetBlue flight from New York to Aruba for at total of $350 on top of the tickets. (The 8-month-old traveled on her lap.) "The only seats available were the ones that cost extra," she said. But faced with the prospect of sitting apart, "I said, 'fine, just do it,' " she said.
'If You Don't Bring It,
We Don't Have It'
No one should be surprised at having to take food on board (or pay for it), in addition to basic supplies, but some families, like the Lins, who were refused milk for their twins, are startled to discover just what isn't available.
Mary Clark, a spokeswoman for Continental, the airline the Lins were flying, said the family's experience wasn't typical, and that the airline offers a "variety of complimentary beverages on all of our flights, but occasionally a specific selection may not be available due to customer demand."
Families aren't the only ones affected by the new austerity. Flight attendants, too, miss the days when they could give people pretty much what they needed. "I remember the days when we had lemonade in the summer, hot chocolate in the winter," said Beth Donnelly, a veteran flight attendant with American Airlines who began her career in 1977 on Braniff International Airways. "We had the wings and coloring books, baby food and diapers. Families would come on first and get settled in."
Now, she said, "it's hurry, hurry, hurry. Poor people, now if you don't bring it, we don't have it."
WHAT SHOULD FAMILIES EXPECT AND DO? Even when airlines offer food onboard, often the thing you want is sold out. To ensure that your family has what it needs, take it yourself.
Keep in mind that baby formula and food, breast milk and juice are allowed "in reasonable quantities" exceeding the usual 3.4 ounces required by security according to the Transportation Security Administration.
Consider buying perishables like milk post-security and asking a flight attendant to put those items on ice. Or bring something like Parmalat or Horizon Organic's eight-ounce low-fat milk boxes which can be stored at room temperature until opened. For more tips on foods that travel well, see the June 22 Practical Traveler column, "Pack a Picnic for Your Next Flight."
Does It Have to Be This Way ?
For Americans used to domestic flights, the first taste of a foreign airline can be a head-turner. Eric Lorge, a media studies professor who regularly visits Los Angeles from Europe, was flying American before he tried Air Tahiti Nui from Los Angeles to Paris with his wife and three children, all under the age of 5. He liked that they would often get priority boarding as a family, but what won him over was the way the flight attendants handled his daughter when she was sick. "They kept bringing warm washcloths and water and asking if we needed anything." His experience with United States carriers? "I try to avoid them if at all possible."
Not all foreign airlines roll out the red carpet for families. In 2004 Malaysia Airlines banned children under the age of 2 from traveling in first-class sections on its Boeing 747 jets. Next year, when it is expected to get the first of its Airbus A380 superjumbo jets, the airline will extend the ban to them as well. But the services offered to families by most foreign carriers, which can range from baby sitters in waiting areas to automatic 25 percent discounts (see accompanying article), far exceed those offered by American counterparts.
To be sure, a handful of family courtesies remain on domestic flights, including checking a stroller and car seat at no charge. Children under the age of 2 can fly free on a parent's lap within the United States. And most airlines will allow children to sit in an approved car seat if there is the space for it onboard. On overseas flights American carriers tend to offer families more amenities -- bassinets for infants, pillows, blankets and the occasional child's meal -- because they are competing with foreign airlines.
But why can't all flights within the United States strive for those foreign flourishes?
"It comes down to one thing, and one thing only: cost," said Mr. Harteveldt, of the Atmosphere Research Group. "With travelers so focused on saving money, airlines simply can't afford to offer the amenities foreign flag airlines offer. In addition, U.S. airlines have higher labor costs than many foreign-flag airlines, leaving them with less margin to offer kid-friendly amenities."
Some travel experts believe that airlines are missing an opportunity by not catering to families. Joanne Gardner, owner of the Travel Specialist travel agency in Wheaton, Ill., where nearly half of her business is planning family vacations, estimates that 25 to 35 percent of her clients actively avoid flying. "People really dislike the whole experience," she said, from the baggage fees to having to bring on their own food. "Clients are preferring to take trains, rent a car or drive on their own."
So far, this doesn't seem to have the airlines worried. Only a few airlinestrack the number of families flying with children. Those that do say they haven't noticed any change. "There's plenty more passengers where you came from," said Mr. Boyd, the Colorado aviation consultant, summarizing the airlines' stance: "We don't have to fight over it right now."
But at least one person would like a reason to get on a plane again. Two-and-a-half years ago Kari Dilloo, communications manager for Bing Travel, the Microsoft search site, took her then 3-month-old twins on a 90-minute flight from Seattle to Salt Lake City. Nothing terribly bad happened, but there was so little support from the airline and other passengers that they've opted for road trips ever since.
"I already had low expectations," said Mrs. Dilloo, who had spent months planning the trip and asking friends for tips. "But they dropped even more." If there was an airline that catered specifically to families, she added, "we'd fly them."
Is Your Airline Child-Friendly?
Like all coach passengers, families are increasingly forced to pay up if they want any onboard perks. Here's a look at what families can expect from a range of American carriers on domestic flights.
American
PREBOARDING No. Families who want to board earlier can ask the gate agent or pay $10 a person to guarantee a spot in the first boarding group in coach.
SEATING Bulkhead seats toward the front of coach are reserved for elite passengers or sold as "preferred seats" 24 hours before departure for a fee starting at $4.
KIDS' MEALS Sells a number of "kid-friendly choices" like $10 turkey sandwiches with chips.
ENTERTAINMENT Free child-friendly movies on overhead televisions on most flights longer than four hours. Streaming video via Wi-Fi will be added to 85 MD-80 aircraft before the end of 2011.
STROLLER GATE CHECK Yes, except noncollapsible strollers or those weighing 20 pounds or more, which must be checked at the ticket counter.
Delta
PREBOARDING Yes (no age limit), ahead of first and business class.
SEATING Bulkhead seats may be available for families 24 hours before departure.
KIDS' MEALS $4.50 "Kids PB&J plate" served with fruit and vegetables.
ENTERTAINMENT Last year, Delta brought back the kiddie pilot wings it used to hand out. On flights with seatback televisions, Delta offers 16 On Demand children's television programs that cost $1 per episode or $6 for a television bundle. (Flights without seatback screens may not offer children's movies at all.) Some flights have Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network via satellite television (at no charge).
STROLLER GATE CHECK Yes.
JetBlue
PREBOARDING Yes, for families with children under the age of 2, along with passengers who paid extra for seats with more legroom.
SEATING Bulkhead seats are reserved for customers with disabilities up to 24 hours before departure with remaining seats sold as "Even More Space" seats for $10 to $65 extra.
KIDS' MEALS JetBlue doesn't offer meals on any of its flights, but snacks, including Animal Crackers, are free.
ENTERTAINMENT Seatback televisions offer 36 channels of DirecTV including children's programming and 100 XM Satellite Radio channels free. If time permits, pilots are encouraged to show children the flight deck and offer them JetBlue trading cards.
STROLLER GATE CHECK Yes.
Southwest
PREBOARDING Yes, for families with children up to 4 years old, after passengers in boarding group A, which includes elite fliers, full-fare passengers and those who pay $10 (each way) for early-bird check-in.
SEATING There are no seat assignments. Like other passengers, families must find an open seat once onboard.
KIDS' MEALS No meals onboard. Peanuts and pretzels are free.
ENTERTAINMENT Flight attendants are encouraged to offer children coloring books and airline wings. STROLLER GATE CHECK Yes.
United-Continental
PREBOARDING Yes, for families with children 4 years and younger, after passengers who paid extra for priority boarding on United, which merged with Continental last fall. Continental currently does not sell priority boarding; families board after first class and elite passengers.
SEATING Bulkhead seats are typically reserved for elite passengers or sold for a fee starting at $9.
KIDS' MEALS Snacks and meals, including $7.49 cheese and fruit plates, are offered, depending on length of flight and time of day.
ENTERTAINMENT Most of United's fleet has overhead screens that show in-flight movies. Continental offers satellite TV on more than 75 percent of its 737 Next Generation aircraft and plans to install the service on more planes in 2012.
STROLLER GATE CHECK Yes, except large, noncollapsible strollers, which must be checked at the ticket counter.
US Airways
PREBOARDING Yes, for families with children 4 and younger, along with elite passengers and those who paid extra for bulkhead seats.
SEATING Bulkhead seats are reserved for passengers with disabilities until an hour before departure and are assigned at the gate agent's discretion.

ENTERTAINMENT Nothing on domestic flights.
STROLLER GATE CHECK Yes, except for noncollapsible strollers, which must be checked at the ticket counter.
Virgin America
PREBOARDING Yes, for "small children," after first class and passengers who paid extra for roomier coach seats.
SEATING Bulkhead seats are reserved for "main cabin select" passengers who pay more when booking or $39 to $129 extra to upgrade 24 hours in advance.
KIDS' MEALS Half-sandwiches like peanut butter and jelly served with organic fruit gummy bears ($4).
ENTERTAINMENT Individual seatback screens offer parental controls, free satellite TV including the Disney Channel and Nickelodeon, movies ($5 to $8) and premium programs like Go Diego Go ($2 to $7), free video games and seat-to-seat chat.
STROLLER GATE CHECK Yes.
Discounts, Diapers and Birthday Cakes: Life on Foreign Carriers
International routes generally tend to have more child-friendly perks, like children's meals and bassinets, but some airlines go above and beyond the basics, providing everything from child-size headsets to children's meals that are served before adults'. Here's a look at what lengths some foreign carriers go to for families on international flights.
Air New Zealand
Activity packs that feature "Jet Cadet" cartoon characters are available for children ages 3 to 11 on long-haul flights, as are limited quantities of disposable diapers, drinking cups and formula. Children's meals include scrambled eggs, fruit salad and cereal for breakfast and spaghetti and meatballs for dinner. And its SkyCouch, a trio of economy-class seats that can be turned into one large, sofalike bench by tucking the armrests back and lifting the leg rests, offers families more flexibility. Costs: $100 to $150 on top of ticket prices for a family of three from Los Angeles to London or Auckland.
Air France
Kids' meals, including pre-sliced meat and fish for easy eating, cookies and jars of baby food are available on flights of two and a half hours or more if ordered in advance. For children between 2 and 11, discounts of 33 percent are offered on some long-haul flights. Finger puppets, colored pencils and activity books are also offered onboard.
Air Transat
This Canadian charter company was the winner of the Family Friendly Airline Award, presented by the Kids First Fund earlier this year. It offers dedicated family airport counters at Canadian gateways, courtesy strollers in Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver, and Air Transat Kids Club for 2- to 11-year-olds who live in Canada. Kids Club members receive priority bag handling, free seat selections (normally between 15 to 70 Canadian dollars, about the same in U.S. dollars, depending on seat and route), a surprise from the crew when flying on their birthday, and entry into two yearly drawings for family vacations to Walt Disney World or Paris.

Abstract: [...] it's worse. According to an analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, Mr. Cain's proposal would increase the annual tax bill of a typical family of four earning $50,000 a year by more than $4,000, but would reduce the taxes owed by a similar family earning between $500,000 and $1 million by almost $60,000.

CLOSE watchers of presidential politics weren't surprised to see many of this year's Republican hopefuls proposing to replace the nation's progressive income tax with a flat tax. Such plans reliably surface every four years, and, just as reliably, sink without a trace.
That's not because the current tax system is far from the abominable tangle of complexity that candidates say it is. Actually, it's worse. Flat-tax proponents promise to sweep away that mess by imposing a single levy on every dollar earned. That change, many contend, would allow taxpayers to file their returns on postcards. And surveys suggest positive voter responses to several of the most recent proposals.
Yet none will be adopted, for at least two reasons. One is that a flat tax would do nothing to make filing tax returns any simpler. But, more important, it would greatly exacerbate longstanding growth in income inequality.
One Republican candidate, Herman Cain, enjoyed widespread attention when he unveiled his "9-9-9" plan last month. The plan, as he described it, calls for three simple taxes, each with a 9 percent rate. The first is a tax on income, and the second, on goods bought, is essentially a sales tax. The third taxes business revenue. But because it deducts paid dividends and other nonlabor expenses, it amounts to a tax on wages.
Mr. Cain touted his plan's simplicity, and many voters were apparently impressed. In some surveys of potential Republican primary voters, he quickly captured the top spot held until then by Mitt Romney. Rick Perry, the Texas governor, responded with a flat-tax proposal of his own. At this point, Mr. Romney is the only top-tier Republican candidate without some variant of a flat-tax proposal. But give him time.
The contention that a flat tax would be simpler because it involves only a single rate is flatly wrong. The complexity of the current system has nothing to do with its multiple income brackets.
The hard step in figuring your tax bill is to compute your taxable income -- roughly, the amount you earn, less the myriad exemptions, deductions and various other offsets described in the 3.4-million-word code of the Internal Revenue Service. You'd also have to calculate your adjusted gross income under a flat tax. But once you've completed that step under either system, you consult the tax tables to see how much you owe. In the current system, the entries have multiple brackets and rates already built into them, so this step is no harder than it would be under the tables for a flat tax.
The much more serious concern is that a flat tax would reinforce the trends toward greater income inequality that have been seen over the last several decades. As documented by a recent Congressional Budget Office study, the top 1 percent of income recipients in the United States earned 275 percent more in 2007 than they did in 1979, adjusted for inflation, a period when the earnings of middle-income households grew by less than 40 percent. A flat tax would increase inequality by substantially reducing rates on the most prosperous households, while increasing them on low- and middle-income households.
According to an analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, Mr. Cain's proposal would increase the annual tax bill of a typical family of four earning $50,000 a year by more than $4,000, but would reduce the taxes owed by a similar family earning between $500,000 and $1 million by almost $60,000. The center also estimated that families in the top one-tenth of 1 percent of households would enjoy an average annual tax reduction of nearly $1.4 million under the Cain plan. Similar distributional effects are common under all flat-tax plans, not just Mr. Cain's.
Rising inequality exacts a toll not just on those with lower incomes, but also on those much higher up the income scale. In their 2009 book, "The Spirit Level: Why Greater Equality Makes Societies Stronger," the British public health researchers Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett document a range of social ills that are reliably associated with increased income inequality, both over time within nations and at any particular moment across a broad range of countries. Countries and times with lower inequality fare better on virtually every published index of health, well-being and quality of life.
Those with the highest levels of inequality, like the United States, invariably score poorly on these indexes. And those same countries consistently experience higher rates of violent crime.
TO say that flat-tax proposals are problematic isn't to deny that our current tax system is profoundly dysfunctional. Every year, corporate lobbyists and other supplicants use campaign contributions and other inducements to persuade legislators to enact additional exemptions, deductions and other loopholes. Voters are justifiably angered by having to wade through this complexity, or by having to hire one of the nation's 1.2 million professional tax preparers to do so.
Although a flat tax won't be adopted, taxing consumption is actually a good idea. We should replace the progressive income tax with a simplified and much more steeply progressive tax on each household's annual consumption expenditure -- calculated as the difference between its income and its annual savings. But because half of the members of the Congressional "supercommittee" entrusted with cutting the deficit have pledged never to approve any new tax under any circumstances, that won't happen any time soon.
For the time being, then, our best bet is to do all we can to reduce the gratuitous complexity of our progressive income tax.

Correction: November 13, 2011, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The Economic View column last Sunday, about Republican proposals for a flat tax, defined incorrectly adjusted gross income under the federal tax code. It is the amount earned, minus some expenses and deductions. It does not include other deductions, or exemptions. (Those items are accounted for in what is called taxable income.)

LAST FALL, President Obama threw what was billed as the first White House Science Fair, a photo op in the gilt-mirrored State Dining Room. He tested a steering wheel designed by middle schoolers to detect distracted driving and peeked inside a robot that plays soccer. It was meant as an inspirational moment: children, science is fun; work harder.
Politicians and educators have been wringing their hands for years over test scores showing American students falling behind their counterparts in Slovenia and Singapore. How will the United States stack up against global rivals in innovation? The president and industry groups have called on colleges to graduate 10,000 more engineers a year and 100,000 new teachers with majors in STEM -- science, technology, engineering and math. All the Sputnik-like urgency has put classrooms from kindergarten through 12th grade -- the pipeline, as they call it -- under a microscope. And there are encouraging signs, with surveys showing the number of college freshmen interested in majoring in a STEM field on the rise.
But, it turns out, middle and high school students are having most of the fun, building their erector sets and dropping eggs into water to test the first law of motion. The excitement quickly fades as students brush up against the reality of what David E. Goldberg, an emeritus engineering professor, calls "the math-science death march." Freshmen in college wade through a blizzard of calculus, physics and chemistry in lecture halls with hundreds of other students. And then many wash out.
Studies have found that roughly 40 percent of students planning engineering and science majors end up switching to other subjects or failing to get any degree. That increases to as much as 60 percent when pre-medical students, who typically have the strongest SAT scores and high school science preparation, are included, according to new data from the University of California at Los Angeles. That is twice the combined attrition rate of all other majors.
For educators, the big question is how to keep the momentum being built in the lower grades from dissipating once the students get to college.
"We're losing an alarming proportion of our nation's science talent once the students get to college," says Mitchell J. Chang, an education professor at U.C.L.A. who has studied the matter. "It's not just a K-12 preparation issue."
Professor Chang says that rather than losing mainly students from disadvantaged backgrounds or with lackluster records, the attrition rate can be higher at the most selective schools, where he believes the competition overwhelms even well-qualified students.
"You'd like to think that since these institutions are getting the best students, the students who go there would have the best chances to succeed," he says. "But if you take two students who have the same high school grade-point average and SAT scores, and you put one in a highly selective school like Berkeley and the other in a school with lower average scores like Cal State, that Berkeley student is at least 13 percent less likely than the one at Cal State to finish a STEM degree."
The bulk of attrition comes in engineering and among pre-med majors, who typically leave STEM fields if their hopes for medical school fade. There is no doubt that the main majors are difficult and growing more complex. Some students still lack math preparation or aren't willing to work hard enough.
Other deterrents are the tough freshman classes, typically followed by two years of fairly abstract courses leading to a senior research or design project. "It's dry and hard to get through, so if you can create an oasis in there, it would be a good thing," says Dr. Goldberg, who retired last year as an engineering professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and is now an education consultant. He thinks the president's chances of getting his 10,000 engineers is "essentially nil."
In September, the Association of American Universities, which represents 61 of the largest research institutions, announced a five-year initiative to encourage faculty members in the STEM fields to use more interactive teaching techniques.
"There is a long way to go," says Hunter R. Rawlings, the association's president, "and there is an urgent need to accelerate the process of reform."
The latest research also suggests that there could be more subtle problems at work, like the proliferation of grade inflation in the humanities and social sciences, which provides another incentive for students to leave STEM majors. It is no surprise that grades are lower in math and science, where the answers are clear-cut and there are no bonus points for flair. Professors also say they are strict because science and engineering courses build on one another, and a student who fails to absorb the key lessons in one class will flounder in the next.
After studying nearly a decade of transcripts at one college, Kevin Rask, then a professor at Wake Forest University, concluded last year that the grades in the introductory math and science classes were among the lowest on campus. The chemistry department gave the lowest grades over all, averaging 2.78 out of 4, followed by mathematics at 2.90. Education, language and English courses had the highest averages, ranging from 3.33 to 3.36.
Ben Ost, a doctoral student at Cornell, found in a similar study that STEM students are both "pulled away" by high grades in their courses in other fields and "pushed out" by lower grades in their majors.
MATTHEW MONIZ bailed out of engineering at Notre Dame in the fall of his sophomore year. He had been the kind of recruit most engineering departments dream about. He had scored an 800 in math on the SAT and in the 700s in both reading and writing. He also had taken Calculus BC and five other Advanced Placement courses at a prep school in Washington, D.C., and had long planned to major in engineering.
But as Mr. Moniz sat in his mechanics class in 2009, he realized he had already had enough. "I was trying to memorize equations, and engineering's all about the application, which they really didn't teach too well," he says. "It was just like, 'Do these practice problems, then you're on your own.' " And as he looked ahead at the curriculum, he did not see much relief on the horizon.
So Mr. Moniz, a 21-year-old who likes poetry and had enjoyed introductory psychology, switched to a double major in psychology and English, where the classes are "a lot more discussion based." He will graduate in May and plans to be a clinical psychologist. Of his four freshman buddies at Notre Dame, one switched to business, another to music. One of the two who is still in engineering plans to work in finance after graduation.
Mr. Moniz's experience illustrates how some of the best-prepared students find engineering education too narrow and lacking the passion of other fields. They also see easier ways to make money.
Notre Dame's engineering dean, Peter Kilpatrick, will be the first to concede that sophomore and junior years, which focus mainly on theory, remain a "weak link" in technical education. He says his engineering school has gradually improved its retention rate over the past decade by creating design projects for freshmen and breaking "a deadly lecture" for 400 students into groups of 80. Only 50 to 55 percent of the school's students stayed through graduation 10 years ago. But that figure now tops 75 percent, he says, and efforts to create more labs in the middle years could help raise it further.
"We're two years into that experiment and, quite honestly, it's probably going to take 5 to 10 years before we're really able to inflesh the whole curriculum with this project-based learning," Dean Kilpatrick says.
No one doubts that students need a strong theoretical foundation. But what frustrates education experts is how long it has taken for most schools to make changes.
The National Science Board, a public advisory body, warned in the mid-1980s that students were losing sight of why they wanted to be scientists and engineers in the first place. Research confirmed in the 1990s that students learn more by grappling with open-ended problems, like creating a computer game or designing an alternative energy system, than listening to lectures. While the National Science Foundation went on to finance pilot courses that employed interactive projects, when the money dried up, so did most of the courses. Lecture classes are far cheaper to produce, and top professors are focused on bringing in research grants, not teaching undergraduates.
In 2005, the National Academy of Engineering concluded that "scattered interventions" had not resulted in widespread change. "Treating the freshman year as a 'sink or swim' experience and accepting attrition as inevitable," it said, "is both unfair to students and wasteful of resources and faculty time."
Since becoming Notre Dame's dean in 2008, Dr. Kilpatrick has revamped and expanded a freshman design course that had gotten "a little bit stale." The students now do four projects. They build Lego robots and design bridges capable of carrying heavy loads at minimal cost. They also create electronic circuit boards and dream up a project of their own.
"They learn how to work with their hands, how to program the robot and how to work with design constraints," he says. But he also says it's inevitable that students will be lost. Some new students do not have a good feel for how deeply technical engineering is. Other bright students may have breezed through high school without developing disciplined habits. By contrast, students in China and India focus relentlessly on math and science from an early age.
"We're in a worldwide competition, and we've got to retain as many of our students as we can," Dean Kilpatrick says. "But we're not doing kids a favor if we're not teaching them good life and study skills."
WORCESTER POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE, in Massachusetts, one of the nation's oldest technological schools, has taken the idea of projects to heart. While it still expects students to push their way through standard engineering and science classes, it ripped up its traditional curriculum in the 1970s to make room for extensive research, design and social-service projects by juniors and seniors, including many conducted on trips with professors overseas. In 2007, it added optional first-year projects -- which a quarter of its freshmen do -- focused on world problems like hunger or disease.
"That kind of early engagement, and letting them see they can work on something that is interesting and important, is a big deal," says Arthur C. Heinricher, the dean of undergraduate studies. "That hooks students."
And so late this past summer, about 90 freshmen received e-mails asking if they typically received flu vaccines. The e-mails were not from the health services office, but from students measuring how widely flu spreads at different rates of vaccination. Two of the students had spent part of their freshmen year researching diseases and devising a survey. Now, as juniors, they were recruiting the newcomers to take part in simulations, using neon wristbands and stickers, to track how many of them became "infected" as they mingled during orientation.
Brenna Pugliese, one of the juniors and a biology major, says the two-day exercise raised awareness on campus of the need for more students to get the vaccine. "I can honestly say that I learned more about various biology topics than I ever learned in any other class," she says.
Teachers say they have been surprised by the sophistication of some of the freshmen projects, like a device to harvest kinetic energy that is now being patented. But the main goals are to enable students to work closely with faculty members, build confidence and promote teamwork. Studies have shown that women, in particular, want to see their schoolwork is connected to helping people, and the projects help them feel more comfortable in STEM fields, where men far outnumber women everywhere except in biology.
Seventy-four percent of W.P.I. undergraduates earn bachelor's degrees within four years and 80 percent by six years.
Most of the top state research universities have added at least a splash of design work in the freshman year. The University of Illinois began this fall to require freshmen engineering students to take a course on aspirations for the profession and encourages them to do a design project or take a leadership seminar. Most technical schools push students to seek summer internships and take semesters off to gain practical work experiences. The hope is that the lure of high-paying jobs during an economic downturn will convince more students to stick with it.
Some private schools have also adjusted their grading policies to ease some of the pressure on STEM students. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology has long given freshmen only "pass" or "no record" grades in the first half of the year while they get used to the workload. W.P.I. lets undergraduates take up to three classes for which no grade is recorded if they would have received less than a C. Any required courses would have to be repeated.
Ilea Graedel, a 20-year-old junior in aerospace engineering, says that policy provides "a nice buffer if you want to try something new, like a class outside your comfort zone."
But what really helps Ms. Graedel get through the rigors of STEM, she says, is hanging onto her aspirations. She grew up in a farming area in Washington State, the only student from her high school class of 26 pursuing a technology degree. She has wanted to be an astronaut since she was 3, when her mother took her to Boeing's Museum of Flight in Seattle and bought her a book called "I Want to Be an Astronaut."
The space program has been sharply cut back. Still, she says, "I'm going to hold onto that dream very dearly."

And there are encouraging signs, with surveys showing the number of college freshmen interested in majoring in a STEM field on the rise.
But, it turns out, middle and high school students are having most of the fun, building their erector sets and dropping eggs into water to test the first law of motion. The excitement quickly fades as students brush up against the reality of what David E. Goldberg, an emeritus engineering professor, calls "the math-science death march." Freshmen in college wade through a blizzard of calculus, physics and chemistry in lecture halls with hundreds of other students. And then many wash out.
Studies have found that roughly 40 percent of students planning engineering and science majors end up switching to other subjects or failing to get any degree. That increases to as much as 60 percent when pre-medical students, who typically have the strongest SAT scores and high school science preparation, are included, according to new data from the University of California at Los Angeles. That is twice the combined attrition rate of all other majors.
For educators, the big question is how to keep the momentum being built in the lower grades from dissipating once the students get to college.
"We're losing an alarming proportion of our nation's science talent once the students get to college," says Mitchell J. Chang, an education professor at U.C.L.A. who has studied the matter. "It's not just a K-12 preparation issue."
Professor Chang says that rather than losing mainly students from disadvantaged backgrounds or with lackluster records, the attrition rate can be higher at the most selective schools, where he believes the competition overwhelms even well-qualified students.
"You'd like to think that since these institutions are getting the best students, the students who go there would have the best chances to succeed," he says. "But if you take two students who have the same high school grade-point average and SAT scores, and you put one in a highly selective school like Berkeley and the other in a school with lower average scores like Cal State, that Berkeley student is at least 13 percent less likely than the one at Cal State to finish a STEM degree."
The bulk of attrition comes in engineering and among pre-med majors, who typically leave STEM fields if their hopes for medical school fade. There is no doubt that the main majors are difficult and growing more complex. Some students still lack math preparation or aren't willing to work hard enough.
Other deterrents are the tough freshman classes, typically followed by two years of fairly abstract courses leading to a senior research or design project. "It's dry and hard to get through, so if you can create an oasis in there, it would be a good thing," says Dr. Goldberg, who retired last year as an engineering professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and is now an education consultant. He thinks the president's chances of getting his 10,000 engineers is "essentially nil."
In September, the Association of American Universities, which represents 61 of the largest research institutions, announced a five-year initiative to encourage faculty members in the STEM fields to use more interactive teaching techniques.
"There is a long way to go," says Hunter R. Rawlings, the association's president, "and there is an urgent need to accelerate the process of reform."
The latest research also suggests that there could be more subtle problems at work, like the proliferation of grade inflation in the humanities and social sciences, which provides another incentive for students to leave STEM majors. It is no surprise that grades are lower in math and science, where the answers are clear-cut and there are no bonus points for flair. Professors also say they are strict because science and engineering courses build on one another, and a student who fails to absorb the key lessons in one class will flounder in the next.
After studying nearly a decade of transcripts at one college, Kevin Rask, then a professor at Wake Forest University, concluded last year that the grades in the introductory math and science classes were among the lowest on campus. The chemistry department gave the lowest grades over all, averaging 2.78 out of 4, followed by mathematics at 2.90. Education, language and English courses had the highest averages, ranging from 3.33 to 3.36.
Ben Ost, a doctoral student at Cornell, found in a similar study that STEM students are both "pulled away" by high grades in their courses in other fields and "pushed out" by lower grades in their majors.
MATTHEW MONIZ bailed out of engineering at Notre Dame in the fall of his sophomore year. He had been the kind of recruit most engineering departments dream about. He had scored an 800 in math on the SAT and in the 700s in both reading and writing. He also had taken Calculus BC and five other Advanced Placement courses at a prep school in Washington, D.C., and had long planned to major in engineering.
But as Mr. Moniz sat in his mechanics class in 2009, he realized he had already had enough. "I was trying to memorize equations, and engineering's all about the application, which they really didn't teach too well," he says. "It was just like, 'Do these practice problems, then you're on your own.' " And as he looked ahead at the curriculum, he did not see much relief on the horizon.
So Mr. Moniz, a 21-year-old who likes poetry and had enjoyed introductory psychology, switched to a double major in psychology and English, where the classes are "a lot more discussion based." He will graduate in May and plans to be a clinical psychologist. Of his four freshman buddies at Notre Dame, one switched to business, another to music. One of the two who is still in engineering plans to work in finance after graduation.
Mr. Moniz's experience illustrates how some of the best-prepared students find engineering education too narrow and lacking the passion of other fields. They also see easier ways to make money.
Notre Dame's engineering dean, Peter Kilpatrick, will be the first to concede that sophomore and junior years, which focus mainly on theory, remain a "weak link" in technical education. He says his engineering school has gradually improved its retention rate over the past decade by creating design projects for freshmen and breaking "a deadly lecture" for 400 students into groups of 80. Only 50 to 55 percent of the school's students stayed through graduation 10 years ago. But that figure now tops 75 percent, he says, and efforts to create more labs in the middle years could help raise it further.
"We're two years into that experiment and, quite honestly, it's probably going to take 5 to 10 years before we're really able to inflesh the whole curriculum with this project-based learning," Dean Kilpatrick says.
No one doubts that students need a strong theoretical foundation. But what frustrates education experts is how long it has taken for most schools to make changes.
The National Science Board, a public advisory body, warned in the mid-1980s that students were losing sight of why they wanted to be scientists and engineers in the first place. Research confirmed in the 1990s that students learn more by grappling with open-ended problems, like creating a computer game or designing an alternative energy system, than listening to lectures. While the National Science Foundation went on to finance pilot courses that employed interactive projects, when the money dried up, so did most of the courses. Lecture classes are far cheaper to produce, and top professors are focused on bringing in research grants, not teaching undergraduates.
In 2005, the National Academy of Engineering concluded that "scattered interventions" had not resulted in widespread change. "Treating the freshman year as a 'sink or swim' experience and accepting attrition as inevitable," it said, "is both unfair to students and wasteful of resources and faculty time."
Since becoming Notre Dame's dean in 2008, Dr. Kilpatrick has revamped and expanded a freshman design course that had gotten "a little bit stale." The students now do four projects. They build Lego robots and design bridges capable of carrying heavy loads at minimal cost. They also create electronic circuit boards and dream up a project of their own.
"They learn how to work with their hands, how to program the robot and how to work with design constraints," he says. But he also says it's inevitable that students will be lost. Some new students do not have a good feel for how deeply technical engineering is. Other bright students may have breezed through high school without developing disciplined habits. By contrast, students in China and India focus relentlessly on math and science from an early age.
"We're in a worldwide competition, and we've got to retain as many of our students as we can," Dean Kilpatrick says. "But we're not doing kids a favor if we're not teaching them good life and study skills."
WORCESTER POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE, in Massachusetts, one of the nation's oldest technological schools, has taken the idea of projects to heart. While it still expects students to push their way through standard engineering and science classes, it ripped up its traditional curriculum in the 1970s to make room for extensive research, design and social-service projects by juniors and seniors, including many conducted on trips with professors overseas. In 2007, it added optional first-year projects -- which a quarter of its freshmen do -- focused on world problems like hunger or disease.
"That kind of early engagement, and letting them see they can work on something that is interesting and important, is a big deal," says Arthur C. Heinricher, the dean of undergraduate studies. "That hooks students."
And so late this past summer, about 90 freshmen received e-mails asking if they typically received flu vaccines. The e-mails were not from the health services office, but from students measuring how widely flu spreads at different rates of vaccination. Two of the students had spent part of their freshmen year researching diseases and devising a survey. Now, as juniors, they were recruiting the newcomers to take part in simulations, using neon wristbands and stickers, to track how many of them became "infected" as they mingled during orientation.
Brenna Pugliese, one of the juniors and a biology major, says the two-day exercise raised awareness on campus of the need for more students to get the vaccine. "I can honestly say that I learned more about various biology topics than I ever learned in any other class," she says.
Teachers say they have been surprised by the sophistication of some of the freshmen projects, like a device to harvest kinetic energy that is now being patented. But the main goals are to enable students to work closely with faculty members, build confidence and promote teamwork. Studies have shown that women, in particular, want to see their schoolwork is connected to helping people, and the projects help them feel more comfortable in STEM fields, where men far outnumber women everywhere except in biology.
Seventy-four percent of W.P.I. undergraduates earn bachelor's degrees within four years and 80 percent by six years.
Most of the top state research universities have added at least a splash of design work in the freshman year. The University of Illinois began this fall to require freshmen engineering students to take a course on aspirations for the profession and encourages them to do a design project or take a leadership seminar. Most technical schools push students to seek summer internships and take semesters off to gain practical work experiences. The hope is that the lure of high-paying jobs during an economic downturn will convince more students to stick with it.
Some private schools have also adjusted their grading policies to ease some of the pressure on STEM students. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology has long given freshmen only "pass" or "no record" grades in the first half of the year while they get used to the workload. W.P.I. lets undergraduates take up to three classes for which no grade is recorded if they would have received less than a C. Any required courses would have to be repeated.
Ilea Graedel, a 20-year-old junior in aerospace engineering, says that policy provides "a nice buffer if you want to try something new, like a class outside your comfort zone."
But what really helps Ms. Graedel get through the rigors of STEM, she says, is hanging onto her aspirations. She grew up in a farming area in Washington State, the only student from her high school class of 26 pursuing a technology degree. She has wanted to be an astronaut since she was 3, when her mother took her to Boeing's Museum of Flight in Seattle and bought her a book called "I Want to Be an Astronaut."
The space program has been sharply cut back. Still, she says, "I'm going to hold onto that dream very dearly."

LAST FALL, President Obama threw what was billed as the first White House Science Fair, a photo op in the gilt-mirrored State Dining Room. He tested a steering wheel designed by middle schoolers to detect distracted driving and peeked inside a robot that plays soccer. It was meant as an inspirational moment: children, science is fun; work harder.
Politicians and educators have been wringing their hands for years over test scores showing American students falling behind their counterparts in Slovenia and Singapore. How will the United States stack up against global rivals in innovation? The president and industry groups have called on colleges to graduate 10,000 more engineers a year and 100,000 new teachers with majors in STEM -- science, technology, engineering and math. All the Sputnik-like urgency has put classrooms from kindergarten through 12th grade -- the pipeline, as they call it -- under a microscope. And there are encouraging signs, with surveys showing the number of college freshmen interested in majoring in a STEM field on the rise.
But, it turns out, middle and high school students are having most of the fun, building their erector sets and dropping eggs into water to test the first law of motion. The excitement quickly fades as students brush up against the reality of what David E. Goldberg, an emeritus engineering professor, calls "the math-science death march." Freshmen in college wade through a blizzard of calculus, physics and chemistry in lecture halls with hundreds of other students. And then many wash out.

Risks Seen In Perry Plan For Switch To Pensions

Abstract: The potential risk that underfunded pensions pose to both workers and local taxpayers was one of the reasons that President Obama's bipartisan debt reduction commission -- led by Alan K. Simpson, a Republican former senator from Wyoming, and Erskine B. Bowles, a Democrat and former chief of staff to President Bill Clinton -- recommended enrolling all newly hired state and local government workers in Social Security after 2020.

Full text: Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, who has long been a vocal critic of Social Security, outlined a plan last month that he said would preserve the program "for all generations of Americans." But one part of his plan -- to let state and local government workers opt out of Social Security -- could add risk to their retirements while sapping money from the system.
The proposal runs counter to the recommendations made recently by a couple of high-profile, bipartisan debt reduction commissions -- which called for shoring up Social Security, in part, by enrolling the nearly seven million state and local government workers who are not in the program.
Mr. Perry, whose characterization of Social Security as a "Ponzi scheme" drew criticism from some of his rivals when he entered the Republican presidential race this summer, gave a speech last month in which he called for fixing the Social Security system by, among other things, once again allowing "state and local governments to newly opt out of Social Security and instead allow their employees to pay solely into state or locally run retirement programs."
"This has been done around the country, with better results," Mr. Perry said. "We ought to allow it again."
More than a quarter of state and local government workers do not currently participate in Social Security, though some now wish that they did. Some city workers in Central Falls, R.I., were never enrolled in Social Security, which saved both them and the city from the payroll tax that funds the program. The city filed for bankruptcy this summer and reduced their pensions by as much as half, to as little as $10,000 a year. Now they have no Social Security benefits to fall back on.
Public schoolteachers in Illinois do not participate in Social Security, and their pension fund is in precarious shape. Last year the fund reported having just 48 cents for every dollar of benefits it had promised, largely because the state had failed to pay the required amount of money into it for many years.
Lawmakers in Maine recently considered a proposal to enroll more of its government workers in Social Security, but discovered that the transition costs would be crushing.
Mr. Perry is taking a very different approach, saying the law should be changed back to the way it was before 1983, when state and local employers were allowed to join or leave the Social Security program as they wished. Legislation passed that year prohibited public employers from withdrawing from the program once they enrolled in it.
Letting public employees out of the program is only a small part of Mr. Perry's plan for Social Security. Many of his proposals, which include allowing younger workers to open individual savings accounts within Social Security and gradually raising the program's retirement age, are more common and have been debated at great length in recent years. His proposal for state and local government workers, though, comes in the midst of a national debate about the retirement benefits of public sector workers.
The potential risk that underfunded pensions pose to both workers and local taxpayers was one of the reasons that President Obama's bipartisan debt reduction commission -- led by Alan K. Simpson, a Republican former senator from Wyoming, and Erskine B. Bowles, a Democrat and former chief of staff to President Bill Clinton -- recommended enrolling all newly hired state and local government workers in Social Security after 2020.
Mr. Simpson said in an interview that the panel concluded that this would shore up the trust fund with payroll taxes and give workers in the most distressed pension plans something to fall back on. "State and local plans are shot to hell," said Mr. Simpson, who added that he had not read Mr. Perry's plan and had not endorsed a Republican candidate for president.
Enrolling those workers in Social Security would have another benefit, the panel found: the payroll taxes that would be collected would close 8 percent of Social Security's projected 75-year shortfall. Social Security's last crisis was resolved in part by bringing the federal work force into the program in 1984.
Adding better-paid state and local workers like teachers and police officers, who make up most nonparticipants today, would give the federal system's solvency a bigger boost than might be expected. This is because Social Security is set up to shift money toward lower-income people. The better-paid newcomers to the program would tend to add more taxes during their working years, but would not draw out a commensurate amount when they retired.
Many public sector workers who are not in Social Security prefer to remain out of it because they see their pensions as a better deal.
Mr. Perry often points to the example of Galveston County in Texas as a place that opted out of Social Security in favor of a locally run savings plan. Herman Cain, the former pizza executive, has also spoken approvingly of the Galveston plan in several Republican presidential debates.
But they have not mentioned that the Galveston program is actually more expensive than Social Security. Social Security's contribution rate is 12.4 percent of payroll, with 6.2 percent coming from each worker and 6.2 percent coming from the employer. The Galveston plan's total contribution rate is 13.9 percent of the payroll, with 6.1 percent coming from each worker, and 7.8 percent from the county -- or, more specifically, its taxpayers.
And whether it provides a better benefit is open to debate. Studies of the Galveston plan have determined that it provides a better deal for some high-income workers, but a worse one for low- and middle-income workers. And its benefits are not protected from inflation, as Social Security's are.
Still, retirees there do not depend solely on that plan for their retirements; they are also enrolled in the Texas County and District Retirement System, which combines features of a 401(k)-type savings plan and a traditional defined-benefit pension plan.
The plan promises workers a 7 percent return on their contributions, as well as an employer "match" when they retire, usually at age 60. The board, made up of people appointed by the governor, has invested aggressively to meet that goal, including in its portfolio junk bonds, distressed-debt partnerships, private equities, commodities and a big assortment of hedge funds.
If a county comes up short, the state gives it the right to reduce its workers' benefits, said Amy Bishop, a spokeswoman. "That's really the key," she said. "They can lower those benefits."

Full text: CORRECTION APPENDED
CLOSE watchers of presidential politics weren't surprised to see many of this year's Republican hopefuls proposing to replace the nation's progressive income tax with a flat tax. Such plans reliably surface every four years, and, just as reliably, sink without a trace.
That's not because the current tax system is far from the abominable tangle of complexity that candidates say it is. Actually, it's worse. Flat-tax proponents promise to sweep away that mess by imposing a single levy on every dollar earned. That change, many contend, would allow taxpayers to file their returns on postcards. And surveys suggest positive voter responses to several of the most recent proposals.
Yet none will be adopted, for at least two reasons. One is that a flat tax would do nothing to make filing tax returns any simpler. But, more important, it would greatly exacerbate longstanding growth in income inequality.
One Republican candidate, Herman Cain, enjoyed widespread attention when he unveiled his "9-9-9" plan last month. The plan, as he described it, calls for three simple taxes, each with a 9 percent rate. The first is a tax on income, and the second, on goods bought, is essentially a sales tax. The third taxes business revenue. But because it deducts paid dividends and other nonlabor expenses, it amounts to a tax on wages.
Mr. Cain touted his plan's simplicity, and many voters were apparently impressed. In some surveys of potential Republican primary voters, he quickly captured the top spot held until then by Mitt Romney. Rick Perry, the Texas governor, responded with a flat-tax proposal of his own. At this point, Mr. Romney is the only top-tier Republican candidate without some variant of a flat-tax proposal. But give him time.
The contention that a flat tax would be simpler because it involves only a single rate is flatly wrong. The complexity of the current system has nothing to do with its multiple income brackets.
The hard step in figuring your tax bill is to compute your taxable income -- roughly, the amount you earn, less the myriad exemptions, deductions and various other offsets described in the 3.4-million-word code of the Internal Revenue Service. You'd also have to calculate your adjusted gross income under a flat tax. But once you've completed that step under either system, you consult the tax tables to see how much you owe. In the current system, the entries have multiple brackets and rates already built into them, so this step is no harder than it would be under the tables for a flat tax.
The much more serious concern is that a flat tax would reinforce the trends toward greater income inequality that have been seen over the last several decades. As documented by a recent Congressional Budget Office study, the top 1 percent of income recipients in the United States earned 275 percent more in 2007 than they did in 1979, adjusted for inflation, a period when the earnings of middle-income households grew by less than 40 percent. A flat tax would increase inequality by substantially reducing rates on the most prosperous households, while increasing them on low- and middle-income households.
According to an analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, Mr. Cain's proposal would increase the annual tax bill of a typical family of four earning $50,000 a year by more than $4,000, but would reduce the taxes owed by a similar family earning between $500,000 and $1 million by almost $60,000. The center also estimated that families in the top one-tenth of 1 percent of households would enjoy an average annual tax reduction of nearly $1.4 million under the Cain plan. Similar distributional effects are common under all flat-tax plans, not just Mr. Cain's.
Rising inequality exacts a toll not just on those with lower incomes, but also on those much higher up the income scale. In their 2009 book, "The Spirit Level: Why Greater Equality Makes Societies Stronger," the British public health researchers Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett document a range of social ills that are reliably associated with increased income inequality, both over time within nations and at any particular moment across a broad range of countries. Countries and times with lower inequality fare better on virtually every published index of health, well-being and quality of life.
Those with the highest levels of inequality, like the United States, invariably score poorly on these indexes. And those same countries consistently experience higher rates of violent crime.
TO say that flat-tax proposals are problematic isn't to deny that our current tax system is profoundly dysfunctional. Every year, corporate lobbyists and other supplicants use campaign contributions and other inducements to persuade legislators to enact additional exemptions, deductions and other loopholes. Voters are justifiably angered by having to wade through this complexity, or by having to hire one of the nation's 1.2 million professional tax preparers to do so.
Although a flat tax won't be adopted, taxing consumption is actually a good idea. We should replace the progressive income tax with a simplified and much more steeply progressive tax on each household's annual consumption expenditure -- calculated as the difference between its income and its annual savings. But because half of the members of the Congressional "supercommittee" entrusted with cutting the deficit have pledged never to approve any new tax under any circumstances, that won't happen any time soon.
For the time being, then, our best bet is to do all we can to reduce the gratuitous complexity of our progressive income tax.
Correction: November 13, 2011, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The Economic View column last Sunday, about Republican proposals for a flat tax, defined incorrectly adjusted gross income under the federal tax code. It is the amount earned, minus some expenses and deductions. It does not include other deductions, or exemptions. (Those items are accounted for in what is called taxable income.)

Re "How Much Does Health Cost?" (Sunday Review, Oct. 30):
Citing the latest figures from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development showing that the United States spends far more than all other countries on health care, Ezekiel J. Emanuel notes that the United States "is actually doing worse than a number of countries, like France or Germany, that spend considerably less."
I believe that a significant factor in high health care spending and poor health care results is the high rate of obesity in the United States. The O.E.C.D. report states that the adult obesity rate in the United States is 33.8 percent, considerably higher than rates in Western Europe and Japan.
A government initiative to reduce the national obesity rate would go a long way toward improving Americans' health. One approach would be a federal tax credit for fitness-related expenditures like gym memberships.

To the Editor:
One of the major problems in controlling health care costs in the United States is the expectation that we will use maximum resources to prolong life, regardless of its quality. We maintain individuals on mechanical ventilation, dialysis and other life support even when they have a terminal malignancy or end-stage organ failure and these treatments are futile.
Typically this level of care is demanded by family members of an unconscious patient, often overriding the expressed wishes of the patient, even in the presence of an advance directive.
Europeans are less likely to subscribe to the belief that extraordinary inpatient care is warranted for the terminally ill. Rather, they believe that care in familiar surroundings with family and friends at home or in a hospice facility with comfort measures is more appropriate to allow the patient to die in peace and with dignity.

To the Editor:
Regarding Ezekiel J. Emanuel's article pointing out that the United States spends almost 50 percent more per patient than second-ranked Norway and twice as much as France:
Your Oct. 29 front-page article "Sports Medicine Said to Overuse a Popular Scan" noted that M.R.I.'s "are easily misinterpreted and can result in misdiagnoses leading to unnecessary or even harmful treatments." As a rheumatologist, I am aware that M.R.I.'s for patients with knee pain, especially in those over 50, will almost always reveal an abnormality of questionable significance in a cartilage or ligament. Except for an acute injury, surgical arthroscopic treatment is unlikely to result in improvement.
The costs for unnecessary and useless procedures for diagnosis and treatment must be controlled with strict guidelines for their use. There will be anguished cries of "rationing" from specialty societies and patient groups, but I see no other tenable way to start to control medical costs.

To the Editor:
Re "U.S. Economy Picks Up Pace, Averting a Stall" (front page, Oct. 28):
While the nation saw a 2.5 percent growth in the economy last quarter, a major part of the increase in consumer spending is for health care. As robust as health care industries are, they must serve consumers better by delivering value for the dollar, not just cost.
Consumers are going deeper into debt on health care, whose costs continue to rise well beyond the rate of inflation. At the same time, a recent Commonwealth Fund report shows no significant progress in quality of care, access to care and patient-centered outcomes.
Health care spending should not be the driver for our recovery. In fact, reducing health care spending is essential to our country's economic well-being. Payment reform, more efficient and reliable delivery systems, and better information for doctors and patients about effectiveness of medical interventions are what we need to improve care and hold down costs -- which would be good for both consumers and for businesses.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- When the Census Bureau said in September that the number of poor Americans had soared by 10 million to rates rarely seen in four decades, commentators called the report "shocking" and "bleak." Most poverty experts would add another description: "flawed."
Concocted on the fly a half-century ago, the official poverty measure ignores ever more of what is happening to the poor person's wallet -- good and bad. It overlooks hundreds of billions of dollars the needy receive in food stamps and other benefits and the similarly formidable amounts they lose to taxes and medical care. It even fails to note that rents are higher in places like Manhattan than they are in Mississippi.
On Monday, that may start to change when the Census Bureau releases a long-promised alternate measure meant to do a better job of counting the resources the needy have and the bills they have to pay. Similar measures, quietly published in the past, suggest among other things that safety-net programs have played a large and mostly overlooked role in restraining hardship: as much as half of the reported rise in poverty since 2006 disappears.
The fuller measures have also shown less poverty among children but more among older Americans, who are plagued by high medical costs. They have shown less poverty among blacks but more among Asians; less poverty in rural areas and more in cities and suburbs, where the cost of living is high. And they have found fewer people in abject destitution, but a great many more crowding the hard-luck ranks of the near poor, who do not qualify for many benefit programs and lose income to taxes, child care and medical costs.
"The official measure no longer corresponds to reality," said Jane Waldfogel, a professor of social work at Columbia University. "It doesn't get either side of the equation right -- how much the poor have or how much they need. No one really trusts the data."
Coming amid soaring need and bitter debt debates, the findings in Monday's release are likely to offer fodder both to defenders of safety-net programs and fiscal conservatives who say the government already does much to temper hardship and needs to do no more.
Experts expect the new report to be consistent with a decade of research about the ways in which the official poverty rate distorts the realities of American poverty.
The numbers in this article are based on that research -- by the census, the National Academy of Sciences and others -- and include not just cash income but also government benefits, work expenses, taxes and cost of living. Many experts expect Monday's census report, based on similar methods, to add a bit to the official poverty count of 46.2 million, while most experts also expect the recent growth will ap-pear less steep.
One alternate census data set quietly published last week said the number of poor people has grown by 4.6 million since 2006, not by 9.7 million as the bureau reported in September. At least 39 states showed no statistically significant poverty growth despite surging unemployment, according to an analysis by The New York Times, including Michigan, New York, New Jersey, Ohio, Tennessee and Texas.
In North Carolina, poverty has risen by more than 250,000 people by official count, but stayed flat under the alternate measure despite soaring unemployment.
One explanation can be found in programs the official count ignores: food stamps and tax credits. Combined the two programs delivered $221 billion across the country last year, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, more than doubling since 2006.
In Charlotte, Angelique Melton was among the beneficiaries. A divorced mother of two, Ms. Melton, 42, had worked her way up to a $39,000 a year position at a construction management firm. But as building halted in 2009, Ms. Melton lost her job.
Struggling to pay the rent and keep the family adequately fed, she took the only job she could find: a part-time position at Wal-Mart that paid less than half her former salary. With an annual income of about $7,500 -- well below the poverty line of $17,400 for a family of three -- Ms. Melton was officially poor.
Unofficially she was not.
After trying to stretch her shrunken income, Ms. Melton signed up for $3,600 a year in food stamps and received $1,800 in nutritional supplements from the Women, Infants and Children program. And her small salary qualified her for large tax credits, which arrive in the form of an annual check -- in her case for about $4,000.
Along with housing aid, those subsidies gave her an annual income of nearly $18,800 -- no one's idea of rich, but by the new count not poor.
"They help you, my God," Ms. Melton said. "I would not have made it otherwise."
The official way of counting poverty -- beloved not even by many of the people who run the count -- is a historical artifact. A federal official named Mollie Orshansky created it as a placeholder in 1963 until something more sophisticated came along.
It takes a limited view of income by counting cash alone. It ignores expenses, like taxes and medical costs. And it set the poverty threshold in an outmoded way -- as a multiple of food costs, which have dwindled as a share of most budgets, as is typical as a country becomes richer over time.
All three elements need updating, experts say. Yet other than to adjust the poverty line for inflation, the government has not changed it since Ms. Orshansky's day. Efforts to do so have been slowed by both technical and political concerns. Conservatives worry liberals will inflate the number to justify more spending; liberals worry conservatives will define poverty away.
Virtually every effort to take a fuller view -- counting more income and more expenses -- shows poverty rising more slowly in the recession than the official data suggests. That is true of localized studies in New York City and Wisconsin and at least four different national data sets that the Census Bureau publishes. While the official national measure shows a rise of 9.8 million people, the fuller census measures show a range from 4.5 million to 4.8 million.
"That's a big difference," said Timothy Smeeding, an economist at the University of Wisconsin who oversaw the study in that state. "It's about time we started counting the programs we use to fight poverty."
Arloc Sherman, a senior researcher at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said the new measure "is showing that government help is keeping millions of families above the poverty line right now."
While most scholars have called the fuller measure a step forward, Robert Rector, an analyst at the Heritage Foundation, argues that both census counts -- old and new -- sharply overstate the amount of deprivation in the United States. In a recent study, he cited government data showing many poor families had game systems like Xbox.
"When the American public hears the word poverty, they are thinking about material hardship -- bad housing, homelessness and hunger," he said. "Most of the people that are defined as poor by the government are not poor in that sense."
One consistent finding in the alternate measures is that poverty falls among children, the target of many government programs. And it rises among Americans 65 or older, who often have high out-of-pocket medical costs, despite being covered by Medicare.
Such is the case for John William Springs, 69, a retired city worker in Charlotte who gets nearly $12,000 a year in Social Security and disability checks. That leaves him about $1,300 above the poverty threshold for a single adult his age -- officially not poor. Then again, Mr. Springs had a heart attack last summer and struggles with lung disease. Factor in the $2,500 a year that he estimates he spends on medicine, and Mr. Springs crosses the statistical line into poverty.
An upbeat survivor of a lifetime of need, Mr. Springs fills his prescriptions in partial amounts and argues the poverty counters got him right the first time.
"I ain't poor," he said. "I eat. I got a roof over my head."
Some experts say cases like that of Mr. Springs may point to a hidden need among the elderly, whose official poverty rates have sharply declined over the past generation. Others have cautioned that the new measure still has flaws -- failing to capture, for instance, that many elderly can draw from savings and are less reliant on annual income and benefits than younger people.
One concern in recent years is the sharp rise in "deep" poverty, defined as living on less than half the money it would take to no longer be poor. That is partly because of changes that make cash welfare harder to get. Yet many of the very poor do receive food stamps, a program whose rapid expansion has made it a safety net of last resort.
In part by counting food stamps, the fuller Census measure analyzed by The Times shows deep poverty falling by nearly 25 percent.
At the same time, all the new measures show many more people in "near poverty" -- living on incomes between 100 percent and 150 percent of the poverty line. The alternate census data show a 50 percent rise in their numbers, with 44 million Americans in that economic band, where benefits dwindle in sums lost to taxes and child care, and medical expenses mount. "That's where your safety net benefits phase out," said Sheila Zedlewski, a researcher at the Urban Institute.
Even with assistance, life is a series of hard choices. Ashley Bolton was lifted above the poverty line under the new measure by about $10,000 in federal programs that cushioned her earnings as a hostess at the Original Pancake House in Charlotte. Still, sometimes she lets her car insurance lapse. She juggles two part-time jobs with classes to become a pharmacy technician, and relies on her mother, who works nights, to put her children to bed.
"I live the recession," Ms. Bolton said. "All that stuff that happened to people -- that's my life every day."

Full text: MANAGUA, Nicaragua -- Ivan Romero, 37, has many colorful ways of describing President Daniel Ortega: mosquito, crook, tyrant, propagandist.
Yet on Sunday, when Nicaragua holds national elections, Mr. Romero will mark his ballot not for the opposition, but for five more years of Mr. Ortega.
"I'm voting for his ideas, not for him," said Mr. Romero, a waiter. "I will cover my nose and do it."
In this country of 5.7 million people, Mr. Ortega, 65, has flourished as a paradox, a heavy-handed commander who is widely criticized for skirting the democratic process but is known on the streets as the people's president. He has found support from powerful players on all sides, lionized by the left for his focus on the poor and revered by some on the right -- including those who once condemned him -- for his hands-off approach to business.
He has had less success wooing foreigners. The election is expected to be a major test of Mr. Ortega's relations with Western powers, namely the United States, which is still fuming about his efforts to reinterpret the Constitution to permit his re-election. Tens of millions of dollars in aid to Nicaragua from the United States and the European Union could be in jeopardy if the elections are not free from fraud, analysts contend.
Mr. Ortega, a hero of Nicaragua's revolutionary war more than three decades ago, has sought to dispel the many depictions of him as power-hungry.
In Managua, the capital, his smile beams from billboards that declare "love, peace and life!" Christmas tree displays stay lighted in public plazas throughout the year, a reminder that while the world reels from recession, Mr. Ortega has kept Nicaragua's economy humming.
"This democratic process is going in a good direction," Mr. Ortega's wife and chief spokeswoman, Rosario Murillo, told local reporters recently. "That is a reality you feel everywhere. There is a mood of celebration."
"Without a doubt," Ms. Murillo added, "he will continue being president."
It is a sign of his sturdy grip that so many seem poised to stand by the president and his party, the Sandinista National Liberation Front. Mr. Ortega was supported by 48 percent of those surveyed in a recent CID Gallup poll, 18 points ahead of his closest rival, Fabio Gadea, a 79-year-old radio personality.
Mr. Ortega has broadened his base of supporters through his success in rejuvenating Nicaragua's economy, most visibly through a partnership with Hugo Chavez, the president of Venezuela. The alliance has brought about $400 million each year in long-term loans to the $6 billion Nicaraguan economy.
While it is unclear exactly how the money is spent, Mr. Ortega regularly announces new policies aimed at the working class, including fuel subsidies for taxi drivers and land titles for lower-income families.
"He's like a pinata," said Carlos Reyes, 53, a farmer in northern Nicaragua who said he had received two cows and a truckload of fertilizer from the government. "The money keeps coming."
Mr. Ortega has also won allies in the private sector, a constituency that has long been suspicious of Sandinista candidates and of Mr. Ortega in particular. During his previous stint as president, from 1985 to 1990, Mr. Ortega's policies helped usher in a period of rampant inflation and economic anxiety.
Two decades later, to the surprise of even some in his own party, he has abandoned socialist economic doctrine for a moderate, free-market approach. Under his leadership, tourism and exports have boomed, and labor relations are tranquil.
In a sign of Mr. Ortega's close relationship with business, the Superior Council of Private Enterprise, a national coalition of business chambers, did not endorse a presidential contender this year. In previous elections, it often sided with non-Sandinista candidates.
Though the economy will be front and center on Sunday, Mr. Ortega's history of ignoring complaints about the electoral process, particularly after national and international watchdogs alleged widespread fraud by the Sandinistas in the 2008 municipal elections, has left his critics on a hair trigger.
Already, the Independent Liberal Party has accused Mr. Ortega's party of scheming to pick up votes by denying identification cards to critics of the government, while granting them to Honduran citizens working along the border. (The government disputes the allegations.)
And many still resent Mr. Ortega's political maneuvering to permit his re-election. The Nicaraguan Constitution bars leaders from serving consecutive terms and limits their total service to two terms. But Nicaragua's Supreme Court, which Mr. Ortega controls, ruled in 2009 that the limits violated human rights.
"If the candidate is in the people's interest, they will elect him, and if the candidate does not represent their wishes, they will not elect him," Mr. Ortega said in a rare television interview that year. "Obstacles should not be set up to deny them that right."
The United States cut about $62 million in aid over concerns about the 2008 elections but has otherwise largely let Mr. Ortega be, wary of provoking anti-American sentiment.
"He goes to the precipice, but he doesn't jump off," explained Robert J. Callahan, who stepped down as the American ambassador to Nicaragua in July. "He does just enough to allow the community of democracies to justify staying and attempting to work with him."
Mr. Callahan said that if there was evidence of widespread fraud in the elections, the United States should cut off future economic aid to the country, refuse to name a new ambassador and forcefully condemn Mr. Ortega. In a statement, the State Department said it remained concerned about the potential for voting irregularities.
Some Nicaraguans, even those who support Mr. Ortega, said his barbed language had isolated the country. "He has worsened the relationship unnecessarily," said Alvaro Maradiaga, 20, an architecture student from Managua who hopes to spend time in the United States. Nevertheless, Mr. Maradiaga said he would vote along party lines for Mr. Ortega.
Mr. Ortega's rivals in the presidential race have seized on his unilateralist approach, warning that he may move to an extreme if he is re-elected and gains a majority in the National Assembly.
But in a crowded field, his opponents have struggled to win a significant block of voters, and many lack steady financing. They have focused their energy on recruiting young people, given that more than half of Nicaragua's population is under 30.
Mr. Gadea, the radio personality, who used his platform to back the contra rebellion against the Sandinistas in the 1980s, has built the most fervent following. During a recent campaign stop in Matagalpa, a hilly agricultural community in the north, thousands of his supporters marched through the streets downtown, some stopping to tear down Sandinista flags. On a sidewalk, schoolchildren of opposing parties spit at each other and flashed party signs -- two fingers for Mr. Ortega, three for those supporting Mr. Gadea.
"We are going to elect an honorable president, an honorable government, so that this country gets rid of the scar of corruption," Mr. Gadea told the crowd. "We aren't going to ask you if you are liberal or conservative. We will build a government for all."
For many Nicaraguans, the problems remain the same. Poverty is rampant -- much of the population lives on just a few dollars each day, according to recent estimates -- and unemployment remains high. Education levels are anemic, and violence from the regionwide drug war is beginning to tear at the country's edges.
But many say that in Mr. Ortega, they have found some stability, even if he is not perfect.
"My family can sleep peacefully at night," said Mr. Romero, the waiter. "What else is there to worry about?"

Full text: FRANKFURT -- The new president of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, quickly responded to the latest developments in the sovereign debt crisis on Thursday, overseeing a cut in the euro zone's benchmark interest rate while warning of a mild recession.
Two days after assuming office in one of the most turbulent phases in the history of the euro zone, Mr. Draghi signaled that he might be more willing than his predecessor, Jean-Claude Trichet, to tolerate inflation in the name of economic growth. The bank cut the benchmark rate to 1.25 percent from 1.5 percent, a move aimed at putting more money into the European economy by making borrowing easier.
Investors cheered the decision by pushing stocks higher in Europe and the United States.
The cut, which surprised some analysts, may signal a shift in strategy -- or at least in tone -- at the bank, which oversees monetary policy for the 17 European Union nations that share the euro. Known for his caution, Mr. Draghi, formerly the governor of the Bank of Italy, was not expected to make bold moves so soon.
But speaking to reporters after he presided as chairman of the bank's governing council for the first time, Mr. Draghi indicated that he felt he had little choice but to reduce interest rates. He warned that economic growth was likely to be significantly worse than the bank expected. That assessment came a day after the Federal Reserve also reduced its growth forecasts through 2013.
While campaigning this year to succeed Mr. Trichet, Mr. Draghi emphasized his credentials as an inflation fighter and as a voice of fiscal prudence in his native Italy. But on Thursday, he played down the risks posed by inflation, which at a current annual rate of 3 percent is above the bank's target of about 2 percent. Slower growth, he indicated, would act as its own curb on inflation.
"In such an environment, price, cost and wage pressures in the euro area should also be moderate," he said. "Today's decision takes this into account."
At the same time, though, Mr. Draghi disappointed those who want the bank to help calm skittish global investors by aggressively buying European government bonds, using its ability to print money to reduce the risk that the Greek crisis might create a contagion infecting Italy, Spain and others. He stuck to the position that the bond purchases the bank has been making since the spring of 2010 were temporary and limited, and justified solely as a way for the bank to maintain its control over interest rates.
Rather, Mr. Draghi said, it was up to national leaders to regain investor confidence by reining in spending and removing excessive regulations and other obstacles to growth. "The first and foremost responsibility for maintaining financial stability lies with national economic policies," he said.
Mr. Draghi's statements on bond market intervention led some analysts to conclude that, despite the rate cut, he would not veer significantly from the path set by Mr. Trichet. Mr. Draghi described his predecessor on Thursday as a "role model."
The bank has spent 173.5 billion euros, or $240 billion, intervening in bond markets since May 2010, a modest sum compared with the securities purchases made by the Fed or the Bank of England to help prop up their own financial markets and stimulate their economies.
"The E.C.B. seems to be continuing to play its dangerous game of doing the minimum amount possible, counting on the European politicians to extinguish the fire," Jens Sondergaard, an analyst at Nomura, wrote Thursday in a note to clients.
Still, some analysts said that Mr. Draghi's statements on bond buying should not be taken at face value and that the bank would intervene if necessary to save the euro.
"If worse came to worst, the E.C.B. would buy government bonds on a massive scale," Jorg Kramer, chief economist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt, wrote in a note.
But Mr. Draghi cannot say that out loud, the thinking goes, for fear that leaders like Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy would renege on promises to remove barriers to competition and improve economic performance.
"It is understandable that they don't want to give governments a free lunch," said Marie Diron, a former European Central Bank economist who advises the consulting firm Ernst & Young.
European stocks rose sharply after the bank rate announcement. The Euro Stoxx 50, a barometer of euro zone blue chips, climbed 2.45 percent, helped by signs that Greece would move ahead with the bailout plan. The euro rose to $1.3812. The main United States stock gauges also rose.
After just one meeting of the governing council, it was too early to say whether Mr. Draghi would set the bank on a new course. But he seemed to confirm predictions by some analysts that he would take a more nuanced view of inflation than Mr. Trichet, who was not an economist. Mr. Draghi has a doctorate in the field.
Mr. Draghi on Thursday seemed at ease as the top official at the central bank, rather than just one vote on the governing council. He sparred confidently with reporters and seemed to answer questions more directly than Mr. Trichet, who had been prone to digressions.
Mr. Draghi seemed to be "a bit more open," Ms. Diron said. She noted his frank use of the word "recession."
"It is unusual that the E.C.B. would use these words before the data is published," she said.
Mr. Draghi, however, also added an extra degree of formality to the monthly news conference, delegating an aide to choose questioners. Mr. Trichet made such selections himself.
The rate cut is the first by the bank since May 2009. It came after interest rate increases in April and July under Mr. Trichet, which many analysts say have made Europe's economic woes worse than they would be otherwise.
Mr. Draghi said the decision to cut rates was unanimous -- a surprise considering the reverence with which German members of the bank's governing council regard price stability.
Mr. Draghi has assumed office with Greece's future in the euro zone in doubt. But he rejected suggestions that Greece could exit, saying there was no legal provision for the country to do so. "It's not in the treaty," he said. "I have nothing to add to that."
Mr. Draghi also said that Greece should be the only country to receive debt relief. There have been rumblings in countries like Portugal and Ireland that they, too, should get breaks on their debt. "The Greek situation is exceptional and unique," Mr. Draghi said.
The Portuguese prime minister, Pedro Passos Coelho, has ruled out renegotiating the main targets set by the International Monetary Fund, the European Union and the European Central Bank, or asking for more money, Reuters reported. But he said the country wanted to discuss "more flexible conditions in applying the program."
The central bank meeting coincided with a meeting of the Group of 20 leaders in Cannes. Mr. Draghi planned to meet with G-20 leaders on Thursday night but said he would attend only in his capacity as chairman of a panel that makes recommendations on bank regulation.

Growth in Service Sector Is Slow but Steady, Suggesting Modest Economic Gains

Full text: WASHINGTON (AP) -- Growth at service companies was slow but steady in October and hiring increased. The gains at these businesses, which employ 90 percent of the work force, suggest that the economy is growing at a modest pace.
The Institute for Supply Management said Thursday that its service sector index dipped slightly to 52.9, from 53 in September. Any reading higher than 50 indicates expansion.
The index covers retailers, financial services companies, hotels and all other nonmanufacturing businesses. The overall index is just higher than a 17-month low of 52.7 reached in July. It reached a five-year high of 59.7 in February.
"This is yet more evidence that recession risks have faded, but that the outlook for growth remains weak," Paul Dales, senior United States economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note to clients.
Separately, weekly applications for unemployment benefits dropped to a seasonally adjusted 397,000, the Labor Department said on Thursday. It was only the third time since April that applications had fallen below 400,000. Still, applications would have to fall below 375,000 to signal sustained job gains.
A Commerce Department report showed that companies ordered more factory goods in September for a third straight month. The gain was largely because businesses spent more on industrial machinery, computers and software. It indicated that in the sluggish economy, many companies were investing in equipment but not in new hires.
Businesses are getting more out of their workers while paying less to employ them. Worker productivity rose in the July-September quarter by the most in 18 months, the Labor Department said. And labor costs fell.
The jump in productivity resulted largely from the economy's best quarterly growth in a year without much change in hiring or hours worked.
Higher productivity can raise standards of living by enabling companies to pay workers more without raising prices and increasing inflation. But without strong, sustained customer demand, hiring is unlikely.
Consumers helped drive the summer growth by raising spending at triple the spring rate.
When demand rises and productivity is low, it is usually a sign that businesses have reached the limit on the work they can squeeze from their employees. That often leads some to hire, if they want to grow.
But economists worry that consumers will not be able to sustain the summer spending binge. In the July-September quarter, they spent more while earning less. They used their savings to make up the difference. Without more jobs and higher wages, consumers are likely to pare spending in the months ahead.
That may be happening now. Shoppers slowed spending in October, monthly revenue results posted by retailers on Thursday showed. Costco, Macy's, Saks and Target and other companies reported results that fell slightly below analysts' expectations. Weaker sales at big chain stores open for more than a year are a bad sign on the eve of the holiday shopping season.
The government will release its October jobs report on Friday. Analysts expect employers added 100,000 net jobs after adding 103,000 in September. The jobless rate is expected to stay at 9.1 percent for a fourth month in a row.

Full text: CORRECTION APPENDED
FRANKFURT -- The Group of 20 summit meeting in Cannes was supposed to be a chance for Europe and the event's host, President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, to shine. Instead, the two-day meeting is coming at an extraordinarily dark time for the Continent, with Europe in political disarray, its economy tipping into recession and the future of the euro zone in doubt.
If anyone can afford to strut on the beaches of the Cote d'Azur during the meeting on Thursday and Friday, it should be the fast-growing developing countries, especially China, but also India, Russia and Brazil. The balance of power has shifted so rapidly that Europe is now asking them for money, and they are in a stronger position to push their views on trade rules and other issues.
But the leaders of the big emerging economic powers of the world are not likely to be crowing. Not only do they face vulnerabilities of their own, like worrisome levels of inflation in China, but they also do not want to see their best customers struggle economically, especially when another crucial outlet for their exports -- the United States -- is also suffering.
"China is going to be in a pretty good position," said Uri Dadush, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington. "But don't interpret that to mean that China is happy with all this. China is part of the world economy."
That was the sentiment that President Hu Jintao of China expressed in an interview with the French newspaper Le Figaro this week. "China sincerely wishes to see stability in the euro zone and the euro," he said.
Typically, Group of 20 summit meetings are an occasion for the host leader to appear statesmanlike and push pet issues. Mr. Sarkozy had originally intended the Cannes meeting to focus on his call for changes to the international monetary system, in a bid to reduce exchange rate fluctuations and give the euro and other currencies more status compared with the dollar.
In character for the frenetic French president, the agenda also contains an ambitious list of other goals, including changing bank regulation, as well as dealing with unemployment, corruption, tax evasion, food security and global warming. Mr. Sarkozy's schedule even includes a meeting on Thursday morning with Bill Gates of Microsoft to discuss development financing.
There will undoubtedly be pronouncements on many of these issues. Most of the work on such questions is done in advance by lower-level officials. The summit meeting, which begins with a working lunch Thursday, is to a large extent a photo opportunity at which leaders issue communiques that were agreed upon well ahead of time.
But events this week have forced Mr. Sarkozy and Angela Merkel, the chancellor of Germany, to become mired in Greek politics when they would rather that their constituencies see them appearing on the global stage with President Obama or Mr. Hu.
Mr. Sarkozy and Mrs. Merkel met in an emergency session Wednesday afternoon with the heads of European Union institutions and the International Monetary Fund to discuss the Greek situation. In the evening, they met with President George A. Papandreou of Greece, who had declared Tuesday that he would let his people decide in a referendum whether they supported his tough-minded, often painful efforts to keep Greece afloat. The proposal, which could lead to Greece's withdrawal from the euro zone, upset financial markets and undermined the latest European rescue plan.
With the Greek government struggling to stay in power, it is not clear what answers Mr. Papandreou can offer before the referendum, even if he survives a confidence vote in Parliament scheduled for Friday night. He pledged to hold the referendum by Dec. 4 or 5.
Officials said that until Greece's commitment to the plan to fix its budget overruns is clear again, the country is unlikely to receive an 8 billion euro ($11 billion) aid installment, due this month, which is needed before the end of the year to pay bills and salaries.
A spokesman for the German finance ministry said Greece apparently has enough money to keep running until mid-December, when it has to redeem more than 6 billion euros in debt.
Meanwhile, the relentless flow of negative economic news continued. A survey of managers in manufacturing, published Wednesday, pointed to a decline in European output during the last three months of 2011. The biggest drop in sentiment came in Italy, further heightening fears that a combination of slow growth and political paralysis could make it impossible for that country to continue to service its debt.
While markets recovered some of the ground they lost earlier in the week, investors' unease was apparent when the European Financial Stability Facility pulled back from a planned 3 billion euro deal to issue 10-year bonds to help finance Ireland's bailout because of a lack of buyers.
As part of the overall European effort to maintain stability in the euro zone, the facility is to be enlarged from 440 billion euros to 1 trillion euros and provide "risk insurance" to new bonds issued by struggling euro zone countries.
The last-minute cancellation of the small and normally routine operation is "indicative that there is a huge amount of uncertainty out there which hasn't been helped by the Greek decision," said Nick Matthews, senior European economist at Royal Bank of Scotland. "A week ago we thought we had a grand plan."
Contributing to the spirit of turmoil, the Occupy Wall Street movement is expected to inspire a robust turnout for protests against the Group of 20 in nearby Nice.
"The timing is not good for the French president," said Gregory Chin, a senior fellow at the Center for International Governance Innovation in Waterloo, Ontario. The agenda "raised too many expectations instead of delivering on the core issue of global growth," Mr. Chin said by telephone from Cannes.
With the advanced industrial countries weakened, they will be in less of a position to pressure China on perennial issues like its undervalued currency or the need to increase domestic consumption and reduce its trade surplus. China will be in a better position to promote the issues it cares about, like a greater voice in the I.M.F.
But China will face restraints in deploying its power. For one thing, to do so would mean accepting more global responsibility. "They'll keep trying to free-ride as much as possible to focus on their internal challenges," said David Shorr, a policy analyst at the Stanley Foundation, an organization in Muscatine, Iowa, that promotes international cooperation. "The U.S. will keep nudging them to shoulder more responsibilities as a rising power."
Despite its growth, China has serious internal problems, including credit and housing bubbles in some regions, overindebted local governments and rising wages that make it harder to compete with nations like Indonesia or Vietnam.
"They come across as cocky sometimes," said Mr. Dadush of the Carnegie Institute. "But they are very aware they don't want to push their weight around. They have their own issues to deal with."
There are few expectations for any serious breakthroughs. But investors in markets will be watching the sessions in Cannes closely anyway, putting leaders under pressure to offer a stronger response to the European debt crisis even though that issue is not formally on the agenda. German officials, who could not be quoted because of the delicacy of the matter, insisted they would not use the summit meeting to beg China or other countries like Russia and China to contribute to the European rescue fund.
Klaus Regling, the chief executive of the stability fund, was in China and Japan this week trying to attract investors for the fund.
Many analysts are skeptical that the G-20 leaders, who will be together hardly more than 24 hours, will be able to deliver anything but a bland assurance that Europe will do whatever it takes to contain the crisis.
"I think we will get a disappointing comment from them on this," said Carl B. Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y. "They have said over and over that the governments of Europe will do whatever has to be done."

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve significantly reduced its forecast of economic growth through 2013, acknowledging that it had once again overestimated the nation's recovery from the 2008 financial crisis.
Despite the bleak forecast, however, the Fed said that its policy-making committee had decided against taking new measures to stimulate growth at a two-day meeting that concluded Wednesday. The Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said that the central bank already was pushing hard to spur growth and create jobs.
"We have taken a lot of actions," Mr. Bernanke said at a news conference after the announcement. He added that Congress, by contrast, was not doing enough to pull the levers of fiscal policy. Lawmakers are gridlocked over a new jobs proposal from the White House, and a special bipartisan committee charged with reducing the deficit is struggling to reach agreement by Thanksgiving.
"I think it would be helpful if we could get assistance from other parts of the government to help create more jobs," Mr. Bernanke said.
The central bank predicted that the economy would expand 2.5 percent to 2.9 percent in 2012, well below its June projection of 3.3 percent to 3.7 percent. For the following year, 2013, the Fed predicted growth of 3 percent to 3.5 percent, down from a range of 3.5 percent to 4.2 percent.
The unemployment rate, it predicted, would still be at least 8.5 percent at the end of 2012, at least 7.8 percent at the end of 2013 and at least 6.8 percent at the end of 2014. Such reductions probably would come in part from people abandoning the search for work, rather than those finding new jobs.
The unemployment rate was 9.1 percent in September. The government will release October figures on Friday.
This is a difficult time for the Fed and its chairman. Republicans charge that the central bank's existing efforts have gone too far, sowing future inflation. Democrats say that in hesitating to do more, the Fed is ignoring the plight of more than 25 million Americans who cannot find full-time work. And the sluggish pace of growth, which continues to fall short of the Fed's predictions, is a bright marker of its failure to stimulate a recovery.
Mr. Bernanke on Wednesday sought to argue that the Fed was trying to get things just right in maintaining a delicate but necessary balance between competing concerns about inflation and unemployment. He said that Republican critics were ignoring the Fed's record. Five years into the crisis, there is no sign of inflation.
"The area where we have fallen short obviously is on the unemployment side," he said. "So I think that criticisms based on the concern about inflation have so far at least not proved to be very valid."
But Mr. Bernanke also gave little satisfaction to liberal critics. This meeting tested what the Fed was willing to do when the economy was merely muddling along, and the answer that came back: Nothing new. Asked several times why the Fed had paused if jobs are a problem and inflation is not, Mr. Bernanke offered a description but not an explanation: The Fed is willing and able to do more, he said, just not right now.
The Fed's economic forecasts do not have a particularly good track record, but since they are based on individual forecasts submitted by the 17 members of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's policy-making board, the numbers do offer a window into the state of their minds. In a word: glum.
The Fed's assessment of the economy was slightly brighter than after the last meeting in September. The committee's statement noted that growth has "strengthened somewhat" since summer thanks in part to increased consumer spending. But there is still a hole in the economy where housing used to be, and the unfolding financial crisis in Europe continues to shadow the domestic economy. The statement again noted "significant downside risks to the economic outlook, including strains in global financial markets."
Still, the decision to pause won the support of nine of the 10 voting members of the committee. The one dissent came from Charles Evans, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, whose vote echoed his recent speeches in which he has criticized the Fed for caring more about inflation than unemployment. It was the first time since 2007 that a board member had dissented in favor of doing more.
The limiting factor appears to be inflation. The Fed projects -- as do financial markets -- that prices and wages will rise about 2 percent a year, the level that the Fed considers healthy. Mr. Evans and outside critics want the Fed to trade a higher rate of inflation for reductions in unemployment. But Mr. Bernanke and a majority of his colleagues believe that this would unsettle the dearly bought belief that the Fed will keep inflation slow and steady.
The pressure to reconsider that stance has been eased by recent data, including the estimate that growth rose to an annual pace of 2.5 percent in the third quarter. There is also the question of what Congress will do: Further cuts in spending, or a decision to end the payroll tax holiday, would strengthen the case for the Fed to start new aid programs. A plan to pay down the debt would have the opposite effect.
These considerations have suspended for now any movement toward a new round of stimulus, like the proposal by the Fed Governor Daniel K. Tarullo that the Fed should resume buying large quantities of mortgage-backed securities to reduce the cost of mortgage loans, increasing demand for housing.
"While I do not shirk the responsibility of the Fed having to do what it can to meet its mandate, obviously a broad range of policies can affect growth and employment," Mr. Bernanke said. "I hope that there will be a range of actions that will complement and supplement the Federal Reserve's efforts."
Mr. Bernanke indicated that the Fed does plan to expand in the near future the information that it provides about its outlook and policies. Such information can increase the power of those policies. For example, convincing investors that the Fed intends to maintain interest rates near zero for a longer period will tend to drive down rates on long-term loans -- which are set in large part based on expectations about future short-term rates -- thereby reducing the cost of borrowing for businesses and consumers.
A simple change would involve publishing the Fed's predictions for the future level of the short-term interest rates, which it controls directly and has already said that it plans to hold near zero through mid-2013.
Diane Swonk, an economist at Mesirow Financial in Chicago, said the Fed could show greater concern for job creation by tying such a forecast to the unemployment rate, announcing that it would keep short-term rates near zero until unemployment dropped below 7 percent, provided that inflation remained under control.
"This is how you would move toward it," Ms. Swonk said, referring to Mr. Bernanke's mention of the issue during his news conference. "And I think that that is exactly where they are heading."

Full text: WASHINGTON (AP) -- Manufacturing grew more slowly in October, hampered by weaker demand for exports and slower production at factories.
But companies ordered more goods, factories slashed their stockpiles and auto sales rose. Those trends suggest manufacturing activity could rebound in the coming months.
The data, which also showed a slight uptick in construction spending in September, points to an economy that is growing but remains too sluggish to lower the unemployment rate, which has been stuck at 9.1 percent for three consecutive months.
The Institute for Supply Management said Tuesday that its manufacturing index dropped to 50.8, down from 51.6 in September. Any reading above 50 indicates expansion.
Measures of production and new export orders fell. A gauge of employment dipped but remained strong enough to signal that factories were adding workers.
"Over all, economic conditions seem just about strong enough to avoid a recession, but not strong enough to generate any meaningful growth," said Paul Dales, senior United States economist at Capital Economics.
Separately, the Commerce Department said builders spent slightly more in September on projects, the second consecutive monthly increase. A gain in spending on home construction offset declines in government projects. Still, the annual rate of spending is approximately half the $1.5 trillion that economists consider healthy.
A report in China showed that manufacturing grew at the slowest pace in nearly three years in October, partly because of weak export orders.
"Manufacturing is feeling a chill wind from a generally weaker global economic environment, and this is unlikely to change anytime soon," said Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist at MFR Inc.
Factories were among the first businesses to start growing after the recession officially ended in June 2009. The manufacturing sector has grown for 27 straight months, according to the index.
Despite slower growth in American manufacturing, economists were encouraged by details in the I.S.M. report, released by a trade group of purchasing managers.
An index measuring new orders rose to 52.4, the first time it has topped 50 in four months and the highest reading in six months.
Manufacturers also said their stockpiles fell sharply. That means that factories will have to increase output to meet any increase in demand.
And the prices that manufacturers paid for raw materials fell sharply, indicating that inflation pressures are dissipating. The prices index plummeted from 56 to 41, the lowest point since April 2009.

Aftershocks for Athens and Wall Street: European Debt Crisis Tightens Its Chokehold on Global Markets

Abstract: In signs of a reappearance of stress in the European credit markets, the rates that banks charge to lend euros to one another rose, and the costs to banks of swapping euros for dollars in the open foreign exchange market -- the three-month euro-dollar cross-currency basis swap -- also increased sharply.

Full text: The European debt crisis demonstrated again on Tuesday the chokehold it maintains on investors worldwide, as a surprise move by Greece to put the terms of its planned bailout to a public referendum battered global financial markets.
Meanwhile, the bankruptcy of the brokerage firm MF Global sent some ripples through the markets, reducing trading volumes as its traders were barred from commodity exchange floors in Chicago and New York, but analysts and traders said its effects were minor compared with the actions in Greece.
Declines that started in Asia accelerated in Europe -- where the major indexes slumped 5 percent. Bank stocks led the sell-offs, and the broad United States stock market slid nearly 3 percent. In the credit markets, crucial stress gauges moved toward recent highs, while rising interest rates on Italian debt underscored investors' growing doubts about that highly indebted country, which has become the new focus of concern in the euro zone.
"It is all Europe right now," said Eric Green, an economist at TD Securities in New York.
The Greek referendum threatened to undo the work of the summit meeting last week in Brussels, where leaders outlined a rescue plan that cheered markets and contributed to the biggest monthly United States stock market rally in October since 1982.
"The markets don't know which way to look," said Andrew Wilkinson, an economist at Miller Tabak & Company.
"This has absolutely blindsided markets."
The declines in Europe wiped out the exuberant gains of last week after the Brussels deal, which initially led some investors to believe Europe was addressing the Greek problem. The reversal in Greek markets included insurance contracts on bonds pricing in a higher likelihood of default.
Even last week doubts grew that the grand European plan would be enough to stop the crisis from spreading to Italy, a much bigger economy that has to refinance billions of euros of debt in the coming year.
Italy has a small budget deficit of about 3 percent of its gross domestic product, which means it has a relatively small amount of net new borrowing to do, although this percentage may be revised upward if growth slows next year as expected.
The much bigger problem is its mountain of existing debt that must be rolled over as it matures -- about 52 billion euros this year and 307 billion more next year, according to Tobias Blattner, an economist at Daiwa Securities in London.
As Italy's borrowing costs shoot up -- the 10-year government bond yield jumped to a record 6.33 percent on Tuesday -- investors are concerned that too much of its strained budget will be consumed by the costs of its enormous debt.
In signs of a reappearance of stress in the European credit markets, the rates that banks charge to lend euros to one another rose, and the costs to banks of swapping euros for dollars in the open foreign exchange market -- the three-month euro-dollar cross-currency basis swap -- also increased sharply.
The cost of insuring the debt of a basket of European banks against default rose to the highest level since Oct. 5. It now costs $261,000 to insure $10 million of bank debt annually for five years, compared with $207,000 at the end of last week, according to the data provider Markit.
Analysts said European leaders had so far failed to come up with a clear solution to cope with a problem on the scale of Italy's debt.
Officials had proposed maximizing the European bailout fund, though they did not offer details, and in particular had not defined a role for the European Central Bank, analysts said.
The central bank was buying bonds to support the Italian bond market on a large scale on Tuesday, traders said. But many analysts say it is inevitable that the central bank will have to act much more aggressively, in effect printing money by buying hundreds of billions of euros of bonds from peripheral countries like Italy.
Such an action, however, is politically poisonous in countries like Germany where the public fears inflation. It would be a big test for Mario Draghi, the new president of the European Central Bank, whose first day in office was Tuesday.
"We are going to have an escalation of the crisis until the E.C.B. steps in," said Holger Schmieding, an economist at Berenberg Bank. "It will have to signal very clearly that it will not let a solvent sovereign go."
Following the bankruptcy of MF Global, the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday delisted its stock from trading.
Mike Zarembski of OptionsXpress said the bankruptcy of the firm, a large player in the commodities markets, had temporarily reduced volumes in those markets in Chicago and New York. Floor brokers and traders who cleared their trades through MF Global on Monday were barred from the trading floors.
In New York, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 2.79 percent, or 35.02 points, to 1,218.28, and the Dow Jones industrial average fell 2.48 percent, or nearly 300 points, to 11,657.96. The Nasdaq composite index was down about 2.9 percent at 2,606.96.
In Europe, the sentiment had been even more negative.
The Euro Stoxx 50 index closed down 5.3 percent, the German DAX down 5 percent and the French CAC 40 down 5.4 percent. In Britain, which is not a member of the euro zone but trades heavily with its Continental neighbors, the FTSE 100 index was down 2.2 percent.
As they have repeatedly in recent months, bank stocks led the broader markets sharply lower. Financial stocks fell 4.7 percent in the United States, and nearly twice that in Europe.
The benchmark 10-year United States note yield dipped to 1.97 percent, from 2.12 percent, on Monday.
The euro fluctuated during the day amid uncertainty over how the developments in Greece would affect the latest debt deal. The euro, which started the day at nearly $1.39, declined to $1.36 before rising again to nearly $1.37 in the late afternoon.
"When they called for the referendum, that weighed on the euro," Eric Viloria, senior market strategist for Forex.com.
"We have already bounced back up because it has been rumored that the referendum is already dead," he said, referring to news reports that the government might fall.

Global Shares Fall As New Anxiety Arises Over Europe

Full text: Stocks in the United States and in Europe were sharply lower on Monday as uncertainty emerged about the agreement reached in Europe last week to address the debt crisis there.
Major equity indexes fell 2 percent or more, sending the broader market in the United States back into negative territory for the year. Major indexes in Europe fell about 3 percent.
Stocks were lower throughout the session, under pressure from disappointing economic data in Europe, and tumbled sharply late in the session after the prime minister of Greece, George Papandreou, said that his Socialist government would hold a national referendum on the rescue package, raising questions about Greece's ability to follow through on its part of the hard-won deal to stabilize the euro.
That announcement came after the release of economic data earlier in the day by the European statistics agency that inflation remained well above the European Central Bank's target level and that unemployment in Europe remained stubbornly high.
Bank stocks were hit particularly hard after the European debt crisis claimed its first American financial institution, MF Global, the brokerage firm run by Jon S. Corzine. MF Global, holding more than $6 billion in sovereign debt of European countries, filed for bankruptcy protection. Citigroup and Bank of America each fell about 7 percent.
The economic data in Europe came at a bad time for Mario Draghi, who will take over as head of Europe's central bank on Tuesday and will preside over his first policy meeting on Thursday. The bank's policy committee will face a choice of whether to keep a tight rein on inflation or address rising unemployment and further signs of a looming recession.
As signals of a downturn accumulate, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development called on Monday for the central bank to essentially ignore inflation by cutting interest rates to encourage growth.
"The status quo is not acceptable," Angel Gurria, the secretary general of the agency, said in Paris as the organization updated its economic forecasts ahead of the meeting of the Group of 20 government leaders in Cannes, France beginning Thursday.
In comments aimed at G-20 leaders, Mr. Gurria called for a bolder response to what the organization said would be "a marked slowdown" in the euro area next year, including periods of declining economic output. Growth in the United States will also remain weak next year, the organization predicted, below the level needed to substantially reduce unemployment.
"Much of the current weakness is due to a generalized loss of confidence in the ability of policy makers to put in place appropriate responses," the organization said in a statement.
In the United States, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 31.79 points, or 2.47 percent, to 1,253.30. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 276.10, or 2.26 percent, to 11,955.01 and the Nasdaq composite index was down 52.74 points, or 1.93 percent, at 2,684.41.
"Risk aversion is once again taking hold in markets," strategists at Brown Brothers Harriman & Company said in a market commentary.
The S.& P. was down 0.35 percent for the year after Monday's declines, while the Dow was up more than 3 percent and the Nasdaq 1 percent. Still, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 1,041.6 points in October for its biggest monthly point gain ever.
Treasury instruments surged in a flight to safety.
The Treasury's benchmark 10-year bond rose 1 26/32, to 100 3/32, and the yield fell to 2.12 percent from 2.32 percent late Friday.
"Although encouraged by what we consider to be a good start, we suspect Europe will require other measures going forward to effectively deal with its sovereign debt problems," said the U.S.A.A. Investment Management Company in another note.
In Italy, the prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi is under pressure to improve the economy. But Italy appears to be a source of worry for investors about whether the country will be able to service its debt. On Monday, 10-year Italian government bond yields pushed above 6 percent, the highest rate since August. The Euro Stoxx 50 index of euro zone blue chips closed down 3.1 percent, while the DAX in Germany and the CAC 40 in Paris lost about 3.2 percent. The F.T.S.E. 100 in London was down 2.8 percent.
Official data from Europe reinforced the pessimistic economic outlook. Inflation in the 17 European Union countries that use the euro was steady in October at a 3 percent annual rate, according to figures from Eurostat, the European Union's statistics agency. That was contrary to analysts' predictions of a slight decline because of slowing economic growth.
Meanwhile, unemployment edged higher, to 10.2 percent in September from 10.1 percent in August, Eurostat said.
The data, along with a muted official forecast for Spanish growth, offer no easy choices for Mr. Draghi, who succeeds Jean-Claude Trichet as president of the central bank.
The Bank of Spain said Monday that the Spanish economy stopped growing in the three months through September, as government austerity measures cut into domestic consumption.
At the same time, inflation remained well above the central bank's target of about 2 percent. As a result Mr. Draghi, eager to establish his credentials as an inflation fighter, may be hesitant to preside over a rate cut just days after assuming the leadership.
"Our forecast is for the first cut to be delivered this week, but this uncomfortably high headline-inflation reading may make the E.C.B. want to wait until December," analysts at HSBC wrote in a note to clients.
Unemployment was highest in Spain, at 22.6 percent, and in Greece, at 17.6 percent. Italy recorded one of the biggest jumps in joblessness, to 8.3 percent from 8 percent, as well as one of the biggest increases in inflation, to 3.8 percent from 3.6 percent.
"I think it is a big sell-off -- profit-taking after an enormous, ferocious, violent run upward," James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist for Wells Capital Management, said in discussing the decline in stocks.
But he also forecast that some of the data to be released this week could restore market attention to the economy in the United States.
"I think Europe is certainly part of the reason" for the down day, he said. "Where we end this week is going to have more to do with the data coming from Main Street, U.S.A."
In particular, Federal Reserve policy makers hold a two-day meeting that ends on Wednesday, and on Friday the government's monthly report on the job market is to be released.
On Monday, the Chicago Purchasing Managers Index had a reading of 58.4 in October, meaning business activity in the United States continued to expand, but at a slower pace than in September, when it registered 60.4.

Full text: LOS ANGELES -- Hollywood's troubled home entertainment business is moving in an unaccustomed direction: Up.
On Monday, the Digital Entertainment Group, which monitors consumer spending for home entertainment in the United States, is expected to report a 5 percent increase in industrywide revenue for the third quarter, to roughly $3.9 billion from about $3.7 billion a year earlier. It is the first quarterly uptick since the beginning of 2008.
In part, the increase reflects a surge in Blu-ray sales, which are expected to reach $1.23 billion for the first three quarters, up from about $1 billion for the same period a year earlier. That puts them on a par with video store rentals, which have been falling, and on-demand revenue, which has grown more slowly.
The overall gain is modest, but welcome in a business in which piracy, economic weakness and digital competition have steadily eroded what was once Hollywood's core source of income -- the rental and sale of DVDs.
"It's extremely encouraging," said Ronald J. Sanders, the president of Warner Home Video. "I would say things have stabilized."
The numbers reflect an effort to nudge the consumer away from cheap rentals toward high-yield transactions like Blu-ray sales --and may also signal a boost from a slowly improving economy. "I get a guarded sense of optimism from just about every retailer I speak to," said David Bishop, the Sony Pictures Home Entertainment president.
By last year, spending on movies and television programs via discs, video-on-demand and other forms of delivery had fallen to $18.8 billion, down 13.8 percent from its 2004 peak of $21.8 billion. Adjusted for inflation, the drop was almost 26 percent.
Box-office ticket sales in America rose about 12 percent in the same period, to $10.6 billion from $9.45 billion. But half of that is kept by theater owners, and it was not enough to lift the gloom on the home viewing side.
But the third quarter this year was helped by the home release of strong titles like "Transformers: Dark of the Moon," "Thor," and "X-Men: First Class." And comparisons were easier than in the first half, when new pictures were measured against the colossal video sales for "Avatar," which was released to home markets in April 2010.
Though "Avatar" skewed the basis for comparisons, it also laid the groundwork for the current spurt, because it drew consumers toward the Blu-ray format, with Blu-ray sales of the movie reaching 11 million units globally. "It took Blu-ray to another level," said Mike Dunn, Fox's home entertainment president.
The number of homes with Blu-ray players rose 52 percent from a year ago, to 33.5 million in the United States. That rise helped sales for "Star Wars: The Complete Saga," another strong entry in the last quarter.
Blu-ray is important to Hollywood, because each sale yields far more revenue than does a low-cost rental from a kiosk or from Netflix. In a sign that consumers are migrating upstream, the sale of Blu-ray discs is expected to top $423 million for the third quarter, surpassing the total revenue from kiosk rentals, at about $414 million. A year ago, that situation was reversed, with kiosks hauling in substantially more than Blu-ray.
Subscription rentals of physical discs -- the Netflix mailer model -- rose about 5 percent in the quarter, according to preliminary numbers, to about $607 million from $579 million a year earlier. Meanwhile, an increase in subscription streaming -- again, the Netflix model -- as well as electronic sales via iTunes and other sources, and video-on-demand, pushed overall digital delivery up more than 50 percent, to roughly $812 million.
That more than offset a 15 percent decline in regular DVD sales, to about $1.3 billion from $1.55 billion.
A pocket of strength, noted Mr. Sanders of Warner, was video-on-demand, which took in $420 million for the quarter, jumping ahead of video stores.
Studios have been timing the availability of films to nudge viewers toward favored formats. Warner, for instance, has been withholding pictures from kiosk rentals and Netflix until 28 days after they are available in video stores, and recently tried to keep films like "Horrible Bosses" and "The Green Lantern" from being available as rentals even in video stores until they had been on sale for a month. (Blockbuster bypassed Warner and buying rental stock on the open market).
In another attempt to nudge consumers toward sales instead of rentals, some studios offer "UltraViolet," a technology that lets purchasers keep a film in a digital locker, for use on many devices. The hope is that consumers will build collections.
For the year so far, overall spending on home entertainment is still down about 2 percent, from $12.5 billion to about $12.3 billion for the first three quarters.
Mr. Sanders said he doubted the recent upturn would be enough to deliver what the industry hasn't had since 2004 -- a year of growth. "I think we're going to be pretty close to where we are right now," he said.
But Mr. Dunn is not so sure. With Warner's "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2" and Fox's "Rise of the Planet of the Apes" on the way, he is optimistic.
"A week in December is worth a month," he said.

Abstract: The central bank also could expand its extensive portfolio of Treasury securities and mortgage bonds, putting direct downward pressure on long-term rates, but Fed officials are reluctant to do so in the face of considerable political opposition and technical concerns that the purchases would absorb too much of the available stock of securities, crowding out private investors.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- When the Federal Reserve's policy-making committee meets on Tuesday and Wednesday, 5 of the 10 voting members will arrive in open disagreement with the chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, about the direction of monetary policy. Three conservative members say the Fed has already done too much. Two liberals say the Fed needs to do much more.
But it is still the chairman who determines whether the central bank should expand its campaign to stimulate growth for the third time since August, and lately Mr. Bernanke has been focused on an old theme: communicating the benefits of existing policies in order to increase their impact.
The Fed "continues to explore ways to further increase transparency about its forecasts and policy plans," Mr. Bernanke said in a mid-October speech in Boston. Later he described improved communication as perhaps the main lesson that makers of monetary policy should take from the financial crisis.
The Fed is focused on communication because it wants to reduce long-term interest rates, which determine the cost of borrowing for businesses and consumers, but it exerts direct influence primarily on short-term interest rates. Long-term rates reflect expectations about the future path of short-term rates, so the Fed wants to convince investors that it will continue to hold short-term rates near zero.
The central bank also could expand its extensive portfolio of Treasury securities and mortgage bonds, putting direct downward pressure on long-term rates, but Fed officials are reluctant to do so in the face of considerable political opposition and technical concerns that the purchases would absorb too much of the available stock of securities, crowding out private investors.
Charles L. Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, has proposed that the Fed should announce temporary boundaries for inflation and unemployment, pledging to keep short-term interest rates near zero until the unemployment rate drops below 7 percent from its current level above 9 percent, or the medium-term outlook for the rate of inflation rises above 3 percent. It is now somewhat below 2 percent, the maximum rate the Fed views as healthy.
"Given how badly we are doing on our employment mandate, we need to be willing to take a risk on inflation going modestly higher in the short run if that is a consequence of policies aimed at lowering unemployment," Mr. Evans said in a recent speech.
"The Fed has done a good deal of thinking out of the box over the past four years," he said. "I think it is time to do some more."
A growing number of economists outside the Fed have advocated the more aggressive approach of permanently changing the central bank's focus, from the level of inflation to a broader measure of growth -- the present value of economic output -- that would similarly make clear that the Fed was willing to tolerate a higher level of inflation in the short term. That approach, however, has gained little traction within the central bank.
Janet L. Yellen, the vice chairwoman of the Fed's board of governors, described Mr. Evans's idea as "potentially promising" in a speech in Denver two weeks ago. "Such an approach could be helpful in facilitating public understanding of how various possible shifts in the economic outlook would be likely to affect the anticipated timing of policy firming," she said.
But she added that the approach was "not without potential pitfalls." In particular, Fed officials are concerned that targets would be seen as destinations, conveying that the Fed was comfortable with 7 percent unemployment or 3 percent inflation.
The Fed could formally fix the 2 percent rate as a long-term target for inflation, to underscore that the current measures are temporary. Mr. Bernanke has advocated that idea in the past, but as chairman he has hesitated to pull the trigger, in part because of concerns about the political consequences if formalizing an inflation target is seen as a disregard for unemployment.
Citing these concerns, several analysts said the Fed was likely to make a more modest shift in its approach, such as publishing a prediction of the level at which it expects to maintain short-term interest rates over the next several years, alongside existing predictions of the future path of economic growth, unemployment and the rate of inflation. That could give investors greater confidence that short-term rates will remain low.
"Communication is what monetary policy is fundamentally about," said Laurence H. Meyer, a former Fed governor who heads the forecasting company Macroeconomic Advisers, arguing that such policies can have a greater impact than asset purchases.
Pushing back against such proposals are three presidents of regional Federal Reserve banks, concerned that the central bank already has damaged public perceptions of its commitment to maintain inflation at a low level.
"If this drift in inflation risk tolerance were to persist, or were expected to persist, it could give rise to a damaging increase in inflationary expectations," one of the dissidents, Narayana Kocherlakota, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, said earlier this month.
This position is embraced by many Republican members of Congress, and the candidates for the Republican presidential nomination, but the dissident Fed officials have not returned that embrace. Mr. Kocherlakota, in the same speech, described the Fed's work as "a largely technocratic exercise that is fundamentally apolitical."
In addition to Mr. Bernanke's tolerance for public dissent -- reflecting his belief, developed during his prior life as an academic, that central banks should operate more transparently -- the fractious debate reflects the unusual challenges still confronting the Fed long after it expected to be on the road back to normalcy.
The Fed did not predict or prepare for the enduring economic malaise the country is now experiencing. Moreover, while Mr. Bernanke has led what is, taken all together, an unprecedented effort to spur renewed growth, at several points he has chosen to hesitate, avoiding the dangers of doing too much, only to find he had not done enough.
The Fed has twice paused its stimulus campaign, most recently in June, only to be forced back into action by evidence that growth once again was falling short of its predictions.
In August, the Fed announced its intention to maintain short-term interest rates near zero for at least two more years, provided that inflation remained low.
In September, at the committee's most recent meeting, the members decided to further reduce long-term interest rates by shifting $400 billion from investments in short-term Treasury securities to longer-term Treasuries.

Full text: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan -- An antigovernment rally in Lahore, led by the former cricket star Imran Khan, attracted a huge crowd estimated at more than 100,000 people on Sunday evening. The rally represented what supporters and some political analysts said was Mr. Khan's emergence as a serious challenger to the governing Pakistan Peoples Party and its longtime rival, the Pakistan Muslim League-N.
Mr. Khan assailed the leaders of both parties -- President Asif Ali Zardari and Nawaz Sharif -- as creatures of the status quo, and he has been a loud and frequent critic of Pakistan's alliance with the United States, saying it was motivated by money.
The size of the crowd that Mr. Khan drew in Lahore, the provincial capital of Punjab and a traditional stronghold of the Muslim League-N, surprised his opponents and made an impression on political analysts.
Mr. Khan, 58, has languished on the political sidelines for years, and his political party, Tehreek-e-Insaf, or Justice Party, has no seats in the current Parliament. But his popularity has soared recently as voters, especially younger ones, have grown disillusioned with the establishment parties. A survey conducted by an American polling organization, the Pew Research Center, found in June that Mr. Khan had become the most popular political figure in the country.
After the crowd gave him a rousing welcome at the rally on Sunday evening, Mr. Khan threw out challenges to both Mr. Zardari and Mr. Sharif on the question of personal integrity, urging them both to disclose their assets or face civil disobedience.
"This is not a flood, this is a tsunami," Mr. Khan said of the crowd thronging the Minaar-e-Pakistan ground in Lahore to hear him. "Anyone up against it will be swept away."
The government is not required to call a general election until February 2013, but with a sinking economy, rising inflation, power struggles and terrorism taking a toll on the nation, opposition parties have begun pushing for an earlier date.
The Muslim League-N staged its own rally in Lahore last week and called on President Zardari to step down.
Critics and political opponents dismiss Mr. Khan as a political nobody and question his judgment and his party's capacity to mount a serious campaign, let alone to govern. They say it relies entirely on Mr. Khan's personal charisma and lacks any other substantial figures in its ranks.
In an interview at his Islamabad residence on Friday, Mr. Khan shrugged off the criticism.
"People confuse two types of politics," Mr. Khan said as he sprawled on a sofa in the house, situated on a hill that overlooks the city. "One is the politics of movement. The other is traditional power-based politics. Tehreek-e-Insaf is never going to win the traditional way."
Mr. Khan opposes cooperating with the United States against militants based in the restive northwestern regions of the country near the Afghan border. He says that Pakistan should not send its own forces to conduct operations there and should not allow American drone strikes there, either, because of the civilian casualties they cause. He favors a negotiated peace instead.
Mr. Khan led 2,000 people in a protest outside the Parliament in Islamabad on Friday, opposing American drone strikes, and he reiterated his stance at the rally on Sunday.
"My message to America is that we will have friendship with you, but we will not accept any slavery," he said. "We will help you in a respectable withdrawal of your troops from Afghanistan, but we will not launch a military operation in Pakistan for you."
The atmosphere at the Sunday rally was electric. Several famous pop singers warmed up the crowd with music before Mr. Khan's speech, giving the rally the feel of a concert. Women and girls in colorful clothes and sunglasses and young men in Western and national dress filled the audience.
Mr. Khan's speech itself was bit of a letdown to some, wayward and unfocused, but his fans did not mind.
"I felt great," said Said Chaudhry, 26. "It felt like you are part of something that has all the potential of turning into something revolutionary."
In the interview on Friday, Mr. Khan said he expected the Lahore rally to be seen as a test of his political future.
"Lahore decides what happens in Punjab," he said. "Punjab decides what happens in Pakistan."
Analysts said that drawing a big crowd in Lahore would not necessarily translate into electoral success, but it could propel Mr. Khan to the forefront of the political conversation.
"I think it's a historic turning point in the country's politics," said Rasul Baksh Rais, who teaches at the Lahore University of Management Sciences. "It showed that people are deeply touched with the message of hope and change, and also with the frustration that is written all over Pakistan with the existing political parties."
He said that after 15 years on the political fringes, Mr. Khan may have his moment now. "Today, he has been able to get his message across," Mr. Rais said. "This is the beginning. And it will result in a big change in a year or two."

Full text: BEING surprised by something nutty from Herman Cain's presidential campaign is like balking at an autopsy in a "CSI" episode: certain things go with the territory. Still, you had to pause and peel your jaw off the ground after watching an Internet ad for Cain that prompted considerable conversation last week.
In it Cain's chief of staff, who comes across mostly as an untidy salt-and-pepper mustache with a rumpled politico attached, delivers the needless reminder that Cain has "run a campaign like nobody's ever seen." To prove the point he glowers meaningfully at the camera while sucking manfully on a cigarette. Alligators as border-patrol agents and nicotine for all: that's the Cain agenda. The candidate appears in close-up at the end of the commercial, flashing a grin that's two parts demented to one part demonic. Were there a thought bubble attached, it would say, "In my wildest dreams I never thought you people would actually buy this pizza."
Meanwhile Rick Perry, who would trade his five best pairs of custom-made cowboy boots for just one of Cain's percentage points in the polls, tried to steal the dubious thunder of the Herminator's 9-9-9 tax hallucination by announcing an either-or, multiple-choice tax phantasm of his own. It would compel you to hire an accountant to figure out whether you're best served by the existing code or by a 20 percent flat tax designed to spare you the accountant. If you go the 20 percent route, Perry said, you can file your returns on a postcard. I think he should add a deduction for taxpayers whose postcards promote national pride. I'll pick one with the Statue of Liberty. You can do Mount Rushmore or the Washington Monument.
In the midst of all this, two attention-commanding sets of numbers were released. One, from the Congressional Budget Office, confirmed an increasingly uneven distribution of wealth in this country, noting that the inflation-adjusted incomes of the most affluent Americans had grown much, much faster over the last three decades than the incomes of the middle class. The other, from a New York Times/CBS News poll, showed that 74 percent of Americans think the country is on the wrong track and 89 percent do not trust that government will do the right thing.
That's a chilling and extraordinary pessimism, grafted onto a 9.1 percent unemployment rate and projections of a grim economy for some time to come. And it makes the kookiness of the Republican primaries all the more disquieting. As the (later disputed) story goes, Nero fiddled while Rome burned. Cain's chief of staff smokes while the citizenry smolders.
The disconnect between the seriousness of our angst and the silliness of our politics -- between how big our problems are and how hopeless or just plain stuck the people who are supposed to address them seem -- defies belief. Right now the system isn't working, and a recognition of that is one of the ties that bind Occupy Wall Street and the Tea Party. They don't identify the same villains or promote the same solutions. But they're flowers of a shared frustration.
And neither movement is a marginal, renegade phenomenon. A recent Time magazine poll found that 54 percent of Americans have a favorable view of Occupy Wall Street, while 27 percent have a favorable view of the Tea Party. Even assuming some overlap, that translates into a great many people supportive of movements railing against the status quo. These Americans have lost faith in business as usual and government as usual. Small wonder, then, that the Times/CBS poll showed an approval rating for Congress now at 9 percent. Nine percent. I bet a higher percentage of Americans believe that Elvis and Michael Jackson are still alive and honeymooning on Lake Como after a wedding -- to each other -- in upstate New York.
REGARD for Congress isn't likely to rise over the 12 months until the election, given that Republicans and Democrats have largely slipped into campaign mode. For a while, over the summer, President Obama seemed to resist that, and came across as cool-headed and big-minded, his desire to legislate keener than his itch to agitate. But his newly frequent trips outside Washington and newly fiery rhetoric suggest that he has partly given up. In terms of real progress on jobs creation, infrastructure and other matters central to our economic predicament, we could be looking at a solid year of nothingness, and therein lies another of the moment's disconnects. Our need is urgent, but the possibility that it will be meaningfully addressed is remote.
The Congressional supercommittee charged with whittling down the national debt will hold a public hearing Tuesday. The heart beats faster. Already there are reports of a Democratic insistence on significant new taxes and a Republican opposition to same, which basically brings us back to where Obama and John Boehner left off. We're looking at an interminable November.
At least we'll have the Republican presidential candidates to marvel at. And Perry had a marvelous week, in the strict sense of the word. He revived questions about Obama's birth certificate. He also blamed his wretched debate performances on formats that denied candidates adequate time to "lay out your ideas and concepts."
Was it your impression that all he needed was a few more acres of oratorical stamping grounds and eloquence would be his? It was my impression that short-form or long-, Perry is to oratory what Weird Al Yankovic is to balladry. Only the humor isn't intentional.
Elsewhere in the Republican field, Jon Huntsman, the former ambassador to China, told a Chinese-food joke of questionable taste; Michele Bachmann started peddling Bachmann-campaign fleeces in exchange for $75 donations; and the Cain campaign announced that even without promises of commemorative clothing, it had raised $3 million this month. Cain was in a statistical dead heat with Mitt Romney, according to the Times/CBS News poll.
Some observers say that the absurdity of that is indeed a mirror of our distress -- that Americans are grasping at simplistic straws. But Cain's support won't last or turn out to have been all that meaningful. The poll's more consequential findings were that 6 in 10 Republican primary voters weren't paying close attention yet and 8 in 10 said it was too early to decide on a candidate.
What worries me isn't the Cain surge or the Bachmann boomlet before it, but the likelihood that when Americans do focus, more and more will see nothing hopeful happening and a motley crew of politicians who are merely blowing smoke.
What happens then?

Abstract: The Fed would start from some normal year -- like 2007 -- and say that nominal G.D.P. should have grown at 4 1/2 percent annually since then, and should keep growing at that pace. Because of the recession and the unusually low inflation in 2009 and 2010, nominal G.D.P. today is about 10 percent below that path.

Full text: IN October 1979, inflation was running at more than 10 percent a year, and the Federal Reserve's gradual interest rate increases weren't solving the problem. So Paul Volcker, the Fed chairman, dramatically changed how monetary policy was conducted. Today, an equally intractable unemployment crisis demands that Ben S. Bernanke, the current Fed chairman, stage a quiet revolution of his own.
What did Mr. Volcker do? He reasoned that because inflation depends on growth in the money supply, inflation would fall if he brought that growth down. And he believed that by backing up his commitment to lower inflation with a new policy framework, he would break people's inflationary expectations. So the Fed began to explicitly target the rate of money growth.
Hitting that target required pushing interest rates to unprecedented levels. Unemployment rose past 10 percent, and Mr. Volcker was pilloried. At one point, farmers on tractors blockaded Fed headquarters to protest the high rates.
But the policy worked. Inflation fell from 11 percent in 1979 to 3 percent in 1983, and unemployment returned to normal levels. Even my father, who lost his job as a chemical plant manager in the 1981 recession, views Mr. Volcker as a hero. His bold moves ushered in an era of low inflation and steady output growth.
Today, inflation is still low, but unemployment is stuck at a painfully high level. And, as in 1979, the methods the Fed has used so far aren't solving the problem.
Mr. Bernanke needs to steal a page from the Volcker playbook. To forcefully tackle the unemployment problem, he needs to set a new policy framework -- in this case, to begin targeting the path of nominal gross domestic product.
Nominal G.D.P. is just a technical term for the dollar value of everything we produce. It is total output (real G.D.P.) times the current prices we pay. Adopting this target would mean that the Fed is making a commitment to keep nominal G.D.P. on a sensible path.
More specifically, normal output growth for our economy is about 2 1/2 percent a year, and the Fed believes that 2 percent inflation is appropriate. So a reasonable target for nominal G.D.P. growth is around 4 1/2 percent.
Economic research showed years ago that targeting nominal G.D.P. has important advantages. But in the 1990s, many central banks adopted inflation targeting, a simpler alternative. As distress over the dismal state of the economy has grown, however, many economists have returned to the logic of targeting nominal G.D.P.
It would work like this: The Fed would start from some normal year -- like 2007 -- and say that nominal G.D.P. should have grown at 4 1/2 percent annually since then, and should keep growing at that pace. Because of the recession and the unusually low inflation in 2009 and 2010, nominal G.D.P. today is about 10 percent below that path. Adopting nominal G.D.P. targeting commits the Fed to eliminating this gap.
HOW would this help to heal the economy? Like the Volcker money target, it would be a powerful communication tool. By pledging to do whatever it takes to return nominal G.D.P. to its pre-crisis trajectory, the Fed could improve confidence and expectations of future growth.
Such expectations could increase spending and growth today: Consumers who are more certain that they'll have a job next year would be less hesitant to spend, and companies that believe sales will be rising would be more likely to invest.
Another possible effect is a temporary climb in inflation expectations. Ordinarily, this would be undesirable. But in the current situation, where nominal interest rates are constrained because they can't go below zero, a small increase in expected inflation could be helpful. It would lower real borrowing costs, and encourage spending on big-ticket items like cars, homes and business equipment.
Even if we went through a time of slightly elevated inflation, the Fed shouldn't lose credibility as a guardian of price stability. That's because once the economy returned to the target path, Fed policy -- a commitment to ensuring nominal G.D.P. growth of 4 1/2 percent -- would restrain inflation. Assuming normal real growth, the implied inflation target would be 2 percent -- just what it is today.
Though announcing the new framework would help, it probably wouldn't be enough to close the nominal G.D.P. gap anytime soon. The Fed would need to take additional steps. These might include further quantitative easing, more forceful promises about short-term interest rates, and perhaps moves to lower the exchange rate. Such actions wouldn't just affect expectations; they would also be directly helpful. For example, a weaker dollar would stimulate exports.
Nominal G.D.P. targeting would make it more likely that the Fed would take these aggressive actions. Today, each Fed move generates controversy and substantial internal dissension. As a result, even though the central bank has taken some expansionary steps, they've often been smaller than needed and deliberately limited in duration.
Mr. Volcker faced a similar problem in October 1979. Each small rise in interest rates was a major battle. Committing to an overarching goal yielded more forceful action and less dissension within the Fed. Agreeing to a nominal G.D.P. target would do much the same today.
For evidence that adopting the new target could help fix the economy, look at the 1930s. Though President Franklin D. Roosevelt didn't talk in terms of targeting nominal G.D.P., he spoke of getting prices and incomes back to their pre-Depression levels. Academic studies suggest that this commitment played an important role in bringing about recovery.
President Roosevelt backed up his statements. He suspended the gold standard and let the dollar depreciate. He got Congress to pass New Deal spending legislation and had the Treasury monetize a large gold inflow. The result was an end to deflationary expectations , leading to the most impressive swing the country has ever seen from horrible contraction to rapid growth.
Would nominal G.D.P. targeting work as well today? There would likely be unexpected developments, just as there were in the Volcker period. But the new target would have a better chance of meaningfully reducing unemployment than any other monetary policy under discussion.
Because it directly reflects the Fed's two central concerns -- price stability and real economic performance -- nominal G.D.P. is a simple and sensible target for long after the economy recovers. This is very different from Mr. Volcker's money target, which was abandoned after only a few years because of instability in the relationship between money growth and the Fed's ultimate objectives.
Desperate times call for bold measures. Paul Volcker understood this in 1979. Franklin D. Roosevelt understood it in 1933. This is Ben Bernanke's moment. He needs to seize it.

China Is Asked For Investment In Euro Rescue

Full text: PARIS -- A day after European leaders unveiled their latest plan to save the euro, top officials opened talks with China in an effort to lure tens of billions of dollars in additional cash, giving China perhaps its biggest opportunity yet to exercise financial clout in the Western world.
China is expected to demand significant concessions, including financial guarantees and limits on what Beijing sees as discriminatory trade policies, in exchange for any investment in Europe's emergency stability fund. The head of the rescue fund, Klaus Regling, got a cautious reply from Chinese officials Friday during a visit to Beijing, where he said he did not expect to reach an investment deal with China anytime soon.
A senior Chinese official, Vice Finance Minister Zhu Guangyao, said China -- like the rest of the world -- was still waiting for the Europeans to deliver crucial details on how the rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Facility, would operate and be profitable before deciding on whether to participate.
That Europe would turn so openly to China to help stabilize the debt crisis shows how quickly the Chinese economic juggernaut has risen on the world stage. Indeed, if China comes to Europe's aid, it will signal a new international order, with China beginning to rival the role long played by the United States as the world's pivotal financial power.
"This would be a tectonic shift," said Pieter P. Bottelier, an expert on China who teaches at the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University. "It would be so important economically and politically."
Arvind Subramanian, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, said Europe's appeal was another sign that China was already a dominant global power.
"China's power is more imminent, broader in scope and greater in magnitude than anyone imagines," he said. "For instance, China's currency is already having a negative effect not just on the U.S. and Europe, but on everyone else, too. And the rest of the world can't do anything about it. If that's not dominance, what is?"
Europe has turned to Beijing and a handful of other emerging market economies to consider investing in the fund to supplement contributions by the 17 countries that use the euro. Outside investment was presented as critical for the Europeans to create a financial firewall of up to $1.4 trillion to prevent the debt crisis that started in Greece from ravaging larger countries, including Italy and Spain.
In a sign that the crisis was far from over and that investors were still wary of Italy's political paralysis and its huge debt, it was obliged on Friday to pay the highest rate in more than a decade to sell a new bond issue.
The fear is that a failure to contain the crisis would lead to contagion in global financial markets on par with the Lehman Brothers debacle, and deliver a blow not only to the economies of Europe, but also to the United States and other major trading partners.
Such a deterioration would certainly be bad news for China, which could hardly afford to see two of its biggest markets hobbled at the same time.
China has a $3.2 trillion nest egg in foreign reserves, by far the largest hoard of foreign currency in the world, and it needs to find places to park those reserves rather than convert them all to Chinese renminbi, a step that could set off domestic inflation and lead to sharp appreciation in the currency's value. Europeans know that China is eager to move some of the money out of its vast pile of United States Treasury securities, and they are pushing the Continent's crisis as a good opportunity to invest on the cheap.
Hours after European leaders unveiled their grand plan, President Nicolas Sarkozy of France called President Hu Jintao to say that Europe was still looking for some cash, and lobbied Beijing to play a "major role" in helping Europe get its house in order.
Since the Europe crisis worsened two years ago, regional leaders once wary of China's influence have rolled out the red carpet in hopes that China might be a savior for their ailing economies. China has already made deals to expand its footprint into choice Western European countries like Italy and Spain. Now, Chinese-owned companies run the biggest shipping port in Greece. They own highways and other crucial infrastructure, and are working to snap up other strategic businesses to anchor their presence on European soil.
But with Europe's economy verging on its second recession in three years, Chinese officials are wary of taking too big of a risk abroad. China's own economy is slowing, and there is growing unease about inflation and a property bubble. The income gap between the rich and the poor is widening, posing challenges to the leadership in Beijing.
Chinese citizens have also been venting anger on the Internet about government investments in Europe that have turned out to be anything but profitable, including billions of euros worth of volatile bond holdings from stricken countries like Spain and Greece. And on a per capita basis China is still much poorer than Spain, Greece or Italy, meaning officials in Beijing could face a popular outcry if they poured resources into rescuing European countries or banks.
"There is a lot of skepticism within the Communist Party, but also in Chinese public opinion, about China sinking money into European reserve assets," said Jonathan Holslag, the head of research at the Brussels Institute of Contemporary China Studies.
Still, lending a hand to Europe could prove a golden opportunity for China to increase its financial and political clout, and make it more of an equal among giants on the Continent, analysts say.
Although leaders have pledged not to tie political demands to financial investments, Beijing has sought to get the European Union to recognize it as a market economy under global trade rules. Without that status, it is easier for other nations to initiate trade proceedings against China.
China is also eager to persuade Europe to drop its criticism of its currency valuation policies, especially at a time when the United States Congress is weighing legislation that would allow American companies to file trade cases against China on the basis of an undervalued renminbi.
Another longstanding sore point is the arms embargo that Europe and the United States imposed on China after its bloody 1989 crackdown on protesters in Tiananmen Square. The European Union recently considered easing the ban, but the United States has steadfastly objected. More than anything, lifting the ban would signal Europe's acceptance of China as an equal on the world stage.
It is not clear whether China would push that hard, though. As much as Europe wants the cash, Beijing knows that taking things too far could backfire.
"When you look at the diplomatic agenda, most officials understand that trying to impose political conditions on financial support is not going to work, and might even be counterproductive," said Mr. Holslag, the Brussels Institute researcher. "If they become too blunt and assertive in attaching a lot of demands, that might lead to a defensive, if not protectionist, stance in Europe."
Moreover, Europe is China's largest export market, so it may be in Beijing's interest to help boost European stability, said an official close to the Chinese government's deliberations although not directly involved in them.
If a contribution is made to the European stabilization fund, he said, it is likely to be sizable, although smaller than those by the biggest European countries or the International Monetary Fund. What would be crucial, he said, is that Germany, France and the European Central Bank are behind the plan to expand the fund.
"We are looking at China's pile of reserves with envy, and hope the Chinese are willing to spend something on us," said Paul de Grauwe, an economics professor at the University of Leuven in Belgium and an adviser to the European Commission. "But they surely don't want to throw money at this except if they get an ironclad guarantee. If that doesn't happen, I don't think we should count on China to help us out."

Full text: CORRECTION APPENDED
Economic growth in the United States picked up in the last quarter in the latest encouraging sign that the recovery, while painfully slow, had not stalled.
Consumers spent more, especially on health care and utilities, and businesses invested more, in software and vehicles among other items, spurring the fastest growth in a year. The nation's total output of goods and services grew at an annual rate of 2.5 percent from July to September, almost double the 1.3 percent rate in the previous quarter, the Commerce Department estimated on Thursday.
That pace is not brisk enough, however, to recover the ground lost in the economic bust, relieve unemployment or even entirely dispel fears of a second recession.
"It ain't brilliant, but at least it's heading in the right direction," said Ian Shepherdson, the chief United States economist for High Frequency Economics, a data analysis firm. "I want to see 4 percent, but given that people were talking about a new recession, I'll take 2.5 or 3."
Investors embraced the domestic report and a broad agreement struck by European leaders to resolve their debt crisis, causing some major stock indexes to soar by 5 and 6 percent in Europe and by around 3 percent in the United States, where the Dow Jones industrial average closed above 12,200.
Still, one did not have to look far to find cautionary signs in the American economic report. Economists do not expect growth to accelerate in the next few quarters to the point that it drives the unemployment rate well below 9 percent. The improvement is simply not enough to be perceptible to anxious American families.
"For most people, they're unable to really make a distinction between a recession and just 2 percent growth, which means the economy is growing so weakly it can't hire enough people to make a dent in unemployment," said Bernard Baumohl, the chief economist at the Economic Outlook Group.
A 2.5 percent growth rate may be hard to sustain, noted Kathy Bostjancic, director for macroeconomic analysis at the Conference Board, which tracks consumer and executive sentiment. Real income is declining, housing prices are stalled and, as the National Association of Realtors reported on Thursday, home sales in September were down for the third consecutive month. Personal disposable income, adjusted for inflation, fell 1.7 percent in the third quarter, its biggest drop since the third quarter of 2009.
While income was falling, consumer spending rose at an annual rate of 2.4 percent, more than triple the rate in the second quarter.
So where did the money come from? Consumers put away less in savings, and credit card debt inched upward.
"That is unlikely to continue if the economy grows weakly because Americans are much more conscious about adding on a lot of debt to their balance sheet," said Ms. Bostjancic, who added that the negative outlook had begun to spread to businesses.
"C.E.O. confidence is starting to melt away, along with consumer confidence levels, which have always been low," she said.
Car sales were strong in July, August and September, and many analysts pointed to those numbers as evidence that consumers were confident enough to take out loans. But the seasonally adjusted number in Thursday's report showed a slight decline in consumer spending on cars, leading economists to speculate that businesses were responsible for the increase in sales.
Most of the increase in consumer spending was instead driven by nondiscretionary expenses like health care, according to an analysis by David A. Rosenberg, chief economist for Gluskin Sheff, a wealth management firm. "We can understand why consumer confidence has sunk," he wrote, "when spending on essentials such as utilities and medical bills have to be funded by drawing down the personal savings rate."
Declines in the savings rate as large as the one reflected in the report -- one percentage point, to 4.1 percent of income -- are rare, and more than half the time, they herald recession, Mr. Rosenberg said.
Businesses increased their capital investments at a 17.4 percent annual rate. Business spending has been strong throughout the recession, a hopeful sign because investment in factories, offices, equipment and software often precedes hiring.
Some economists also saw a bright spot in inventories, which grew less than expected in the third quarter. That most likely means there are few excess goods piled up, and businesses may need to replenish their inventories in the fourth quarter, producing stronger growth.
The most skeptical economists simply dismissed the Commerce Department's report. The first estimate of gross domestic product is subject to revisions that can be substantial -- growth in the first quarter of this year, for example, was initially reported to be at a 1.8 percent annual rate. That was later adjusted down to 0.4 percent.
Nouriel Roubini, the chairman and co-founder of Roubini Global Economics, said he expected the third quarter estimate would undergo a similar downward revision. By his calculations, Dr. Roubini said, the growth rate in the quarter was closer to 1 percent.
According to Thursday's preliminary report, the economy showed momentum despite the debt ceiling debate and the downgrade of the country's credit rating in August. The economy began to shake off the shocks that held back growth in the first half of the year, like a jump in gasoline prices and the earthquake in Japan.
But other risks loom, from a slowdown in Europe to the possible expiration of the payroll tax cut. President Obama would like to extend those cuts as part of his $447 billion jobs package, which also includes renewing extended unemployment benefits, paying for infrastructure projects and giving aid to states to prevent layoffs of teachers, police officers and firefighters. (Government spending was flat in the latest quarter, with contraction in local, state and federal nonmilitary spending made up for by an increase in military spending.)
"The better growth performance in the third quarter doesn't mean that the economy can't 'double-dip' back into recession," Nigel Gault, an economist with IHS Global Insight, wrote ahead of the report. "But it suggests that it has more momentum than there seemed to be just a month or two ago, and underscores that the primary recession risks are from external shocks, with Europe the biggest wild card."
On the domestic front, analysts seemed to be betting that the payroll tax cut would continue, but were divided on whether extended unemployment benefits would be renewed. Those two programs together represent about 1 percent of gross domestic product, though some of that money may go into savings or be spent on imported goods.

Abstract: Medicare premiums for most beneficiaries have been held in check by a law that, in effect, prevents any reduction in Social Security payments that might be caused by an increase in premiums. Because of low inflation, Social Security beneficiaries did not receive cost-of-living adjustments in 2010 or 2011.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Monthly Medicare premiums for most beneficiaries will rise next year by $3.50, to $99.90, a much smaller increase than had been expected, the Obama administration said Thursday.
Administration officials rejoiced at the modest increase, which could pay political dividends to President Obama as he tries to win the votes of older Americans in his bid for re-election.
In May, the administration predicted that most beneficiaries would be paying premiums of $106.60 a month in 2012.
Administration officials said the smaller increase showed their prudent management of the program, using tools provided by the new health care law to control costs.
Jonathan D. Blum, deputy administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said officials were seeing "much lower utilization and spending growth" in Medicare than they had expected.
Most Medicare beneficiaries have premiums withheld from their monthly Social Security benefits. In most cases, the cost-of-living adjustment in Social Security, averaging $43 a month for retired workers in 2012, will more than offset the increase in premiums, officials said.
Premiums for most Medicare beneficiaries have been frozen at $96.40 a month since 2008. Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services, said the small increase in premiums, amounting to less than 4 percent in four years, was "pretty remarkable." Average premiums paid by workers for employer-sponsored health insurance have increased far more -- well over 20 percent since 2008, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.
Medicare premiums for most beneficiaries have been held in check by a law that, in effect, prevents any reduction in Social Security payments that might be caused by an increase in premiums. Because of low inflation, Social Security beneficiaries did not receive cost-of-living adjustments in 2010 or 2011. About three-fourths of Medicare beneficiaries were therefore shielded against any increase in premiums.
David M. Certner, legislative policy director of AARP, the lobby for older Americans, said he was pleased that the increase in premiums would be lower than expected. But, he said, "seniors still face the very real threat of cuts to Medicare or Social Security" under recommendations being developed by a joint Congressional committee on deficit reduction.
Mr. Certner said the committee was considering proposals that would establish new co-payments for home health care and clinical laboratory services and reduce future cost-of-living adjustments in Social Security.
"These changes would far outweigh today's good news," Mr. Certner said.
Premiums are set to cover about 25 percent of projected spending under Part B of Medicare, a voluntary program that covers doctors' services, diagnostic tests and outpatient hospital care for 48 million people who are 65 and older or disabled.
High-income people pay higher premiums, based on a sliding scale. For the most affluent beneficiaries -- individuals with annual incomes of more than $214,000 and couples over $428,000 -- the monthly premium next year will be $319.70, the administration said.
About 5 percent of Medicare beneficiaries now pay higher premiums based on income. The proportion would eventually rise to 25 percent under a deficit-reduction plan proposed last month by Mr. Obama.
The annual deductible for Part B of Medicare, the amount that beneficiaries pay for services before Medicare starts to pay, will be $140 next year, down $22 from this year. The deductible for Part A of Medicare, which covers inpatient hospital care, will rise by $24, to $1,156 next year.
Medicare officials said the modest increase in premiums for coverage of doctors' services was part of a welcome trend. Earlier this year they announced that average premiums for private Medicare Advantage plans would decrease by 4 percent and that premiums for Medicare's prescription drug plans would be virtually unchanged in 2012. Both types of plans are operated by insurance companies under contract with the government.
In calculating premiums for Part B, Medicare officials assumed that the program would continue paying doctors next year at current rates or slightly more. The payment formula in existing law would reduce Medicare doctors' fees about 29 percent next year, but Congress has regularly intervened to block such cuts.
The upbeat view of Medicare officials on Thursday stands in stark contrast to the grim financial outlook that prevails on Capitol Hill. Republican lawmakers, in particular, are urgently seeking ways to rein in the growth of the program, which they describe as unsustainable.
The smaller-than-expected increase in premiums in 2012 results indirectly from renewed inflation in the last year. The administration announced last week that, because of the uptick in consumer prices, Social Security recipients would get a 3.6 percent increase in benefits in 2012. As a result, more people will also be subject to higher Medicare premiums.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The top 1 percent of earners more than doubled their share of the nation's income over the last three decades, the Congressional Budget Office said Tuesday, in a new report likely to figure prominently in the escalating political fight over how to revive the economy, create jobs and lower the federal debt.
In addition, the report said, government policy has become less redistributive since the late 1970s, doing less to reduce the concentration of income.
"The equalizing effect of federal taxes was smaller" in 2007 than in 1979, as "the composition of federal revenues shifted away from progressive income taxes to less-progressive payroll taxes," the budget office said.
Also, it said, federal benefit payments are doing less to even out the distribution of income, as a growing share of benefits, like Social Security, goes to older Americans, regardless of their income.
The report, requested several years ago, was issued as lawmakers tussle over how to reduce unemployment, a joint committee of Congress weighs changes in the tax code and protesters around the country rail against disparities in income between rich and poor.
In its report, the budget office found that from 1979 to 2007, average inflation-adjusted after-tax income grew by 275 percent for the 1 percent of the population with the highest income. For others in the top 20 percent of the population, average real after-tax household income grew by 65 percent.
By contrast, the budget office said, for the poorest fifth of the population, average real after-tax household income rose 18 percent.
And for the three-fifths of people in the middle of the income scale, the growth in such household income was just under 40 percent.
The findings, based on a rigorous analysis of data from the Internal Revenue Service and the Census Bureau, are generally consistent with studies by some private researchers and academic economists. But because they carry the imprimatur of the nonpartisan budget office, they are likely to have a major impact on the debate in Congress over the fairness of federal tax and spending policies.
Also cited as factors contributing to the rapid growth of income at the top were the structure of executive compensation; high salaries for some "superstars" in sports and the arts; the increasing size of the financial services industry; and the growing role of capital gains, which go disproportionately to higher-income households.
The report found that higher-income households got a larger share of the pie, while other households got smaller shares.
Specifically the report made these points:

The share of after-tax household income for the top 1 percent of the population more than doubled, climbing to 17 percent in 2007 from nearly 8 percent in 1979.

The most affluent fifth of the population received 53 percent of after-tax household income in 2007, up from 43 percent in 1979. In other words, the after-tax income of the most affluent fifth exceeded the income of the other four-fifths of the population.

People in the lowest fifth of the population received about 5 percent of after-tax household income in 2007, down from 7 percent in 1979.

People in the middle three-fifths of the population saw their shares of after-tax income decline by 2 to 3 percentage points from 1979 to 2007.
The study was requested by Senators Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana and chairman of the Finance Committee, and Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, when he was the senior Republican on the panel.
Representative Sander M. Levin of Michigan, the senior Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee, said the report was "the latest evidence of the alarming rise in income inequality."
House Republicans pushed back Tuesday against President Obama's complaint that they were blocking bills to create jobs. Speaker John A. Boehner said he agreed with Mr. Obama's new slogan, "we can't wait," and he said that 15 House-passed bills were "sitting over in the Senate, waiting for action."
On Tuesday, the White House endorsed another bill, which is likely to be passed by the House this week with bipartisan support. The bill would repeal a requirement for federal, state and local government agencies to withhold 3 percent of certain payments to suppliers of goods and services and to deposit the money with the Internal Revenue Service.
This requirement was originally adopted as a tax-compliance measure, and the Congressional Budget Office said its repeal would reduce federal revenues by $11 billion over 10 years.
House Republicans would offset the cost with a bill that reduces federal spending on Medicaid under the 2010 health care law. The White House said it supported the bill, intended to fix an apparent error in the law, under which hundreds of thousands of middle-income early retirees can get Medicaid coverage meant for the poor.
The joint Congressional committee on deficit reduction is considering changes in a wide range of benefit programs.
Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the No. 2 House Democrat, said Tuesday that he was hopeful but not entirely confident that the panel would succeed in reaching a bipartisan agreement to reduce federal deficits by $1.2 trillion over 10 years.
"Hopeful is not confident," Mr. Hoyer said.

Abstract: According to the College Board's new "Trends in Student Aid 2011," report, higher education tax credits and deductions grew to $14.7 billion in 2009, from $6.6 billion in 2008.

Full text: President Obama will announce new programs Wednesday to lower monthly loan payments for some students graduating next year and thereafter and to let borrowers who have a mix of direct federal loans and loans under the old Federal Family Education Loan Program consolidate them at a slightly lower interest rate.
At a press briefing Tuesday afternoon, Melody Barnes, director of the Domestic Policy Council, said the president would use his executive authority to expand the existing income-based repayment program with a "Pay as You Earn" option that would allow graduates to pay 10 percent of their discretionary income for 20 years and have the rest of their federal student loan debt forgiven. That plan would start next year.
Most of the 450,000 low-income student-loan borrowers currently enrolled in income-based payment must pay 15 percent of their discretionary income for 25 years before having their debt forgiven, although terms are easier for those in public service.
The lower caps of the new program were scheduled to go into effect for new borrowers in 2014, but, Ms. Barnes said, "because we know the frustration of crushing loan burdens, we have to act now."
Ms. Barnes noted that over the last month, more than 30,000 people had signed a petition on the We the People platform at whitehouse.gov, asking for relief on student debt.
"It's a message heard loud and clear," she said.
The high cost of college and the growing debt burden of student loans have become increasingly potent political issues in recent years, high on the agenda of Occupy Wall Street and related protests across the country.
And the annual College Board reports on college prices and student aid, to be released Wednesday, make it clear that with the weak economy, the college affordability problem is getting worse.
At public universities and community colleges, costs for the current academic year increased more than 8 percent, lifted in part by steep tuition increases in California, according to the "Trends in College Pricing 2011" report.
While California's whopping increases -- 21 percent at the four-year universities and 37 percent at the community colleges -- were extreme, declining state support for higher education has brought hefty tuition increases at many public universities nationwide. Arizona and Washington, for example, increased their in-state tuition and fees by 17 percent and 16 percent.
This is the fifth consecutive year in which the public universities that serve most students raised their tuition at a faster rate than the far more expensive private universities. And over the last three decades, the report found, the average tuition at four-year state universities almost quadrupled.
"It is not surprising, but we do have issues we have to face," said Sandy Baum, the economist who is co-author of the report. "Families are struggling because their incomes are not increasing, but states are struggling too."
Adjusted for inflation, state appropriations per full-time student are about 23 percent lower than they were a decade ago.
"Families and students are paying more but they're getting less," said Jane Wellman, executive director of the Delta Cost Project, "because what we're willing to invest in this generation is less than what we were willing to invest in my generation."
At Tuesday's press briefing, Secretary of Education Arne Duncan estimated that the debt-consolidation program could help 6 million borrowers who carry both direct federal loans and loans made under the Federal Family Education Loan program, which ended last year. Under that program, private lenders received federal subsidies to make federally guaranteed loans to students; despite lobbying by the banking industry, the Obama Administration killed the program, redirecting billions of dollars of subsidies into expanded Pell grants for low-income students.
Between January and June, Mr. Duncan said, borrowers making payments on both kinds of loans can consolidate them and get a half-percent interest-rate cut. The savings to pay for the lower loan rate, he said, would come from the lower cost of administering the combined loan.
Further information on the new programs will be available at 1-800-4fedaid (1-800-433-3243) or studentaid.ed.gov.
The Obama administration has taken other steps toward college affordability. The American Opportunity Tax Credit, introduced in 2009, expanded the tax benefits for college costs. According to the College Board's new "Trends in Student Aid 2011," report, higher education tax credits and deductions grew to $14.7 billion in 2009, from $6.6 billion in 2008. People with adjusted gross incomes of $100,000 to $180,000 got 26 percent of those tax savings, compared with 18 percent a year earlier. At the other end of the spectrum, the credits are available even to those who owe no taxes.
According to the College Board, average in-state tuition at public universities this year is $8,244, up from $7,613 last year; with room and board, the average total charge is $17,131, up from $16,162 last year. But the averages mask enormous variation from state to state: the University of New Hampshire's tuition is more than $13,500, compared with $2,600 in Puerto Rico and $4,100 in Wyoming.
At private nonprofit four-year colleges, the average tuition is $28,500 this year, a 4.5 percent increase on last year's $27,265. With room and board, the average total charges are $38,589, up from $36,971 last year. And at community colleges, the average tuition and fees are $2,963, up 8.7 percent from last year's $2,727.
Only about a third of full-time students pay for college without some grant aid, whether in the form of a federal Pell grant, a state scholarship or aid from the college itself.
Net tuition --the amount a student actually pays, after grants and tax savings-- is often sharply lower than the published price. In fact, the College Board report said, net tuition at community colleges was low enough that, when grants and tax savings are taken into account, the average student can pay nothing out of pocket and have $810 left over for books and living expenses.
This year, the report said, full-time students at state universities receive an average of about $5,750 in grants and tax benefits, while students at private nonprofit colleges get about $15,530 and those at community colleges about $3,770.

Abstract: [...] let's talk about the pratfalls, which have lately had me humming the old children's song "There's a Hole in My Bucket." Yet Italy is one of those major governments; it can't achieve a rescue by lending money to itself. [...] France, the euro area's second-biggest economy, has been looking shaky lately, raising fears that creation of a large rescue fund, by in effect adding to French debt, could simply have the effect of adding France to the list of crisis countries.

Full text: If it weren't so tragic, the current European crisis would be funny, in a gallows-humor sort of way. For as one rescue plan after another falls flat, Europe's Very Serious People -- who are, if such a thing is possible, even more pompous and self-regarding than their American counterparts -- just keep looking more and more ridiculous.
I'll get to the tragedy in a minute. First, let's talk about the pratfalls, which have lately had me humming the old children's song "There's a Hole in My Bucket."
For those not familiar with the song, it concerns a lazy farmer who complains about said hole and is told by his wife to fix it. Each action she suggests, however, turns out to require a prior action, and, eventually, she tells him to draw some water from the well. "But there's a hole in my bucket, dear Liza, dear Liza."
What does this have to do with Europe? Well, at this point, Greece, where the crisis began, is no more than a grim sideshow. The clear and present danger comes instead from a sort of bank run on Italy, the euro area's third-largest economy. Investors, fearing a possible default, are demanding high interest rates on Italian debt. And these high interest rates, by raising the burden of debt service, make default more likely.
It's a vicious circle, with fears of default threatening to become a self-fulfilling prophecy. To save the euro, this threat must be contained. But how? The answer has to involve creating a fund that can, if necessary, lend Italy (and Spain, which is also under threat) enough money that it doesn't need to borrow at those high rates. Such a fund probably wouldn't have to be used, since its mere existence should put an end to the cycle of fear. But the potential for really large-scale lending, certainly more than a trillion euros' worth, has to be there.
And here's the problem: All the various proposals for creating such a fund ultimately require backing from major European governments, whose promises to investors must be credible for the plan to work. Yet Italy is one of those major governments; it can't achieve a rescue by lending money to itself. And France, the euro area's second-biggest economy, has been looking shaky lately, raising fears that creation of a large rescue fund, by in effect adding to French debt, could simply have the effect of adding France to the list of crisis countries. There's a hole in the bucket, dear Liza, dear Liza.
You see what I mean about the situation being funny in a gallows-humor fashion? What makes the story really painful is the fact that none of this had to happen.
Think about countries like Britain, Japan and the United States, which have large debts and deficits yet remain able to borrow at low interest rates. What's their secret? The answer, in large part, is that they retain their own currencies, and investors know that in a pinch they could finance their deficits by printing more of those currencies. If the European Central Bank were to similarly stand behind European debts, the crisis would ease dramatically.
Wouldn't that cause inflation? Probably not: whatever the likes of Ron Paul may believe, money creation isn't inflationary in a depressed economy. Furthermore, Europe actually needs modestly higher overall inflation: too low an overall inflation rate would condemn southern Europe to years of grinding deflation, virtually guaranteeing both continued high unemployment and a string of defaults.
But such action, we keep being told, is off the table. The statutes under which the central bank was established supposedly prohibit this kind of thing, although one suspects that clever lawyers could find a way to make it happen. The broader problem, however, is that the whole euro system was designed to fight the last economic war. It's a Maginot Line built to prevent a replay of the 1970s, which is worse than useless when the real danger is a replay of the 1930s.
And this turn of events is, as I said, tragic.
The story of postwar Europe is deeply inspiring. Out of the ruins of war, Europeans built a system of peace and democracy, constructing along the way societies that, while imperfect -- what society isn't? -- are arguably the most decent in human history.
Yet that achievement is under threat because the European elite, in its arrogance, locked the Continent into a monetary system that recreated the rigidities of the gold standard, and -- like the gold standard in the 1930s -- has turned into a deadly trap.
Now maybe European leaders will come up with a truly credible rescue plan. I hope so, but I don't expect it.
The bitter truth is that it's looking more and more as if the euro system is doomed. And the even more bitter truth is that given the way that system has been performing, Europe might be better off if it collapses sooner rather than later.

Full text: CORRECTION APPENDED
CRANSTON, R.I.
ON the night of Sept. 8, Gina M. Raimondo, a financier by trade, rolled up here with news no one wanted to hear: Rhode Island, she declared, was going broke.
Maybe not today, and maybe not tomorrow. But if current trends held, Ms. Raimondo warned, the Ocean State would soon look like Athens on the Narragansett: undersized and overextended. Its economy would wither. Jobs would vanish. The state would be hollowed out.
It is not the sort of message you might expect from Ms. Raimondo, a proud daughter of Providence, a successful venture capitalist and, not least, the current general treasurer of Rhode Island. But it is a message worth hearing. The smallest state in the union, it turns out, has a very big debt problem.
After decades of drift, denial and inaction, Rhode Island's $14.8 billion pension system is in crisis. Ten cents of every state tax dollar now goes to retired public workers. Before long, Ms. Raimondo has been cautioning in whistle-stops here and across the state, that figure will climb perilously toward 20 cents. But the scary thing is that no one really knows. The Providence Journal recently tried to count all the municipal pension plans outside the state system and stopped at 155, conceding that it might have missed some. Even the Securities and Exchange Commission is asking questions, including the big one: Are these numbers for real?
"We're in the fight of our lives for the future of this state," Ms. Raimondo said in a recent interview. And if the fight is lost? "Either the pension fund runs out of money or cities go bankrupt."
All of this might seem small in the scheme of national affairs. After all, this is Little Rhody (population: 1,052,567). But the nightmare scenario is that Ms. Raimondo has seen the future of America, and it is Rhode Island. As Wall Street fixates on the financial disaster in Greece, a fiscal wreck is playing out right here. And the odds are that it won't be the last. Before this is over, many Americans may be forced to rethink what government means at the state and local level.
Economists have talked endlessly about a financial reckoning for the United States, of a moment in the not-so-far-away when the nation's profligate ways catch up with it. But for Rhode Island, that moment is now. The state has moved to safeguard its bond investors, to avoid being locked out of the credit markets. Last week, the General Assembly went into special session and proposed rolling back benefits for public employees, including those who have already retired. Whether the plan will succeed is anyone's guess.
Central Falls, a small city north of Providence, didn't wait for news from the Statehouse. In August, the city filed for bankruptcy rather than keep its pension promises to its retired firefighters and police officers.
Illinois, California, Connecticut, Oklahoma, Michigan -- the list of stretched states runs on. In Pennsylvania, the capital city, Harrisburg, filed for bankruptcy earlier this month to avoid having to use prized assets to pay off Wall Street creditors. In New Jersey, Gov. Chris Christie wants to roll back benefits, too.
In most places, as in Rhode Island, the big issue is pensions. By conventional measures, state and local pensions nationwide now face a combined shortfall of about $3 trillion. Officials argue that, by their accounting, the total is far less. But with pensions, hope often triumphs over experience. Until this year, Rhode Island calculated its pension numbers by assuming that its various funds would post an average annual return on their investments of 8.25 percent; the real number for the last decade is about 2.4 percent. A phrase that gets thrown around here, a la Rick Perry describing Social Security, is "Ponzi scheme."
That evening in September, Ms. Raimondo walked into the Cranston Portuguese Club to face yet another angry audience. People like Paul L. Valletta Jr., the head of Local 1363 of the firefighters union.
"I want to get the biggest travesty out of the way here," Mr. Valletta boomed from the back of the hall. "You're going after the retirees! In this economic time, how could you possibly take a pension away?"
Someone else in the audience said Rhode Island was reneging on a moral obligation.
Ms. Raimondo, 40, stood her ground. Rhode Island, she said, had a choice: it could pay for schoolbooks, roadwork, care for the elderly and so on, or it could keep every promise to its retirees.
"I would ask you, is it morally right to do nothing, and not provide services to the state's most vulnerable citizens?" she asked the crowd. "Yes, sir, I think this is moral."
FOR many Americans, the Ocean State conjures images of Newport mansions and Narragansett chic. The overall reality is more prosaic. Rhode Island today is a place where the roads and bridges rank among the worst in the nation and where jobs are particularly hard to find. Unemployment rose faster during the 2008-9 recession than in any other state. The official jobless rate is now 10.6 percent, versus the national average of 9.1 percent.
The textile mills and jewelry manufacturers that once employed thousands here have dwindled away. The big employers today are in health care and education, both of which rely heavily on government spending that has been drying up.
Many states and cities can credibly say their pension plans are viable, even when those plans are not fully funded. That is because state retirement funds, like Social Security, pay out benefits bit by bit, over many years.
But unlike, say, California, with its large, diverse economy, Rhode Island is so small that there is little margin for error. Leaving the state, to escape its taxes, is almost as easy as moving to the other side of town. Efforts to balance the state budget by shrinking the public work force have left Rhode Island with a problem like the one that plagues General Motors: the state has more public-sector retirees than public-sector workers.
More ominous still, in each of the last 10 years, the state pension fund paid more money to retirees than the fund collected from state employees and taxpayers combined. The fund is shrinking, even though the benefits coming due are growing.
For all the pain here, one important constituency -- Wall Street -- seems satisfied enough. To reassure its bond investors, Rhode Island passed a special law this year giving them first dibs on tax revenue. In other words, bondholders will be paid, whatever happens. Ms. Raimondo has at times been accused of selling out ordinary Rhode Islanders to Wall Street interests, but she says hard choices must be made.
Ms. Raimondo remembers better times in Rhode Island. She grew up in a suburb of Providence, rode public buses to public schools and played in public parks. Her grandfather, who arrived from Italy, studied English in the evenings at the Providence Public Library. (In 2009, city funding for all but the central library went to a nonprofit, the Providence Community Library, which shortened the libraries' hours. These days, libraries are seldom open after 6 p.m.)
But Ms. Raimondo also learned early on about economic forces at work in her state. When she was in sixth grade, the Bulova watch factory, where her father worked, shut its doors. He was forced to retire early, on a sharply reduced pension; he then juggled part-time jobs.
"You can't let people think that something's going to be there if it's not," Ms. Raimondo said in an interview in her office in the pillared Statehouse, atop a hill in Providence. No one should be blindsided, she said. If pensions are in trouble, it's better to deliver the news and give people time to make other plans.
BY any standard, Ms. Raimondo is a high achiever. She graduated from Harvard, collected a law degree from Yale and attended Oxford as a Rhodes scholar. After a stint in New York in the venture capital business, she helped found Rhode Island's first venture capital firm, Point Judith Capital.
Then, in 2009, with zero political experience, she ran for the state office of treasurer. Although she is a Democrat in a heavily Democratic state, she stood out because she refused to promise that state jobs and pension benefits would be protected no matter what. She won by a landslide, receiving more votes than any other candidate for any state office. Her long-term ambitions, in politics, business or both, are the subject of speculation in Providence.
No sooner had she been sworn in than the S.E.C. called. She learned that the commission was investigating the finances of various cities and states, including Rhode Island, to determine whether bond investors were receiving truthful information. At the heart of the S.E.C. inquiry were pension funds.
Ms. Raimondo said she wasn't entirely surprised. When she disclosed the investigation, she said: "For months, Rhode Island has been listed among several states with precarious finances. This challenging position is, in part, due to our significant and growing unfunded pension liability." Her first priority, she vowed, would be to ensure that the numbers were right.
Others made similar pledges before. Rhode Island has been trying to fix its pension system for years; it has announced four "reform" plans since 2005, each of which has claimed to reduce costs for the state and cities. It has raised minimum retirement ages, slowed accrual rates, capped cost-of-living adjustments -- but always for the youngest or least senior public workers. Retirees, and workers poised to retire, were spared, even though the numbers clearly showed that reducing payments to retirees was the only sure way to fix things quickly.
In recent months Ms. Raimondo has crisscrossed the state in an attempt to sell a different remedy, one in which everyone takes a hit. Yes, it would hurt. But at least the state would avoid having to come up with yet another plan in a year or two. The defined-benefit structure, very popular with public employees, could survive. Still, the battle lines are clear. Eight public workers' unions have already sued, saying the pension changes of 2009 and 2010 were illegal.
On a September evening out in North Scituate, at the historic Old Congregational Church, Ms. Raimondo told a crowd about what had happened in Vallejo, Calif. That city filed for bankruptcy in 2009 and, after grueling negotiations, left pensions intact but drastically cut bus service, police patrols and other government functions, along with the pay of the city workers who provide all those services.
"That's not what we want for Rhode Island," Ms. Raimondo said. "That's not the future we want for our children."
Others in the crowd had their own stories. Several retired teachers said they had played by the rules and sent a part of every paycheck to the pension fund, as required by law. One man demanded pension cuts for state troopers and judges. A woman said her aged father would be unable to buy medicine if the state stopped adjusting his pension for inflation.
"I feel your anger," Ms. Raimondo told the crowd. "In many ways, I'm angry myself. Many of the shenanigans that went on in past years were just wrong."
In some ways, the central question is not only what the government owes to pensioners but what citizens owe to one another. From the pews of the church, Cindy Gould, a fourth-grade teacher, said that under the current system, she had 11 years to go until retirement. Under Ms. Raimondo's plan, she might have to work longer. But, Ms. Gould, 54, said she was willing to do so if that meant the elderly would get the medical care they need.
Since the last recession hit, states and cities around the country have embarked on pension changes, often following the Rhode Island pattern. Benefits for state employees who have not yet been hired are usually the first to be cut. Then come changes for those now on the payroll, often in the form of higher mandatory contributions.
Retirees have mostly been off-limits, until now. In many instances, laws or legal precedent shield them. In the corporate sphere, they are supposed to bear losses only in bankruptcy. But those rules do not apply to states, which may not declare bankruptcy in any case. If a government homes in on retirees, a lawsuit is sure to follow, and the resolution will take years. But Ms. Raimondo says Rhode Island doesn't have years. This isn't a question of politics or law, she says, but of simple math. To get the numbers right, Ms. Raimondo quickly assembled a panel of experts that included academics, mayors and union officials. The goal was to figure out what a public pension should be and what Rhode Island could afford. Inflation protection every year, for people who in some cases retired in their 40s, started coming into focus.
Analysts also took a close look at the projected long-term investment return for the pension system: 8.25 percent. Everything rested on hitting that target, but the state's actuary said there was less than a 30 percent chance that would happen over the next 20 years. The board voted to lower the assumption to 7.5 percent. (Given the recent run in the financial markets, even that figure may seem optimistic.)
As a result of that change, the state's pension shortfall instantly rose to $9 billion from $7 billion. The unions said Ms. Raimondo had manufactured a crisis.
She denied it. "This is about the truth," she said, "and about doing the right thing."
Then, as if on cue, Central Falls declared bankruptcy. The city's pension fund wasn't just underfunded. It was completely out of money. A receiver for the city sought court permission to reduce by as much as half the base pensions of retired police officers and firefighters.
Suddenly the pension crisis wasn't an abstraction any more. The unthinkable had happened, and the odds were that it would happen again unless the state acted quickly.
Other mayors began stepping forward and warning that their communities were on the brink, too. Here in Cranston, Mayor Allan W. Fung said that unless things changed, he would have to eliminate trash collection, services to the elderly and recreation programs for children, as well as reduce the size of the police force and fire department.
Over in Woonsocket, John F. Ward, the president of the City Council, said that all summer parks programs had been eliminated and that teachers were working with larger classes than their contracts allowed. Half of Woonsocket's streetlights were out because the city couldn't afford to replace them. His son, daughter-in-law and granddaughter had moved to another state.
"To allow the pension system to remain largely unchanged will make it impossible for Woonsocket, and every other urban community, to survive," Mr. Ward said.
AT the Portuguese Club in Cranston, Jose M. Berto raised his hand. At 62, he told Ms. Raimondo, he was on the cusp of retirement.
"We're looking at a Ponzi scheme that would make Bernie Madoff look like a Boy Scout," said Mr. Berto, a supply officer for the state.
He asked if Rhode Island's pension problem was the worst in the nation.
Ms. Raimondo said it was.
"I don't like her message," Mr. Berto said after the session. "But she has been honest, forthcoming. We're in trouble. We're just in so much trouble."
Correction: October 30, 2011, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Sunday about Rhode Island pension funds referred incorrectly to the recent history of the Providence Public Library system. It did not close branches in 2009; city funding for all but the central library went instead to a nonprofit, the Providence Community Library, which has kept them open. (The central library did shorten its hours.) And because of an editing error, the article misstated the middle initial of the City Council president in Woonsocket. He is John F. Ward, not John W.

Full text: AS the economy languishes, politicians and pundits are debating what to do next. When we look around the world, it's hard to find positive role models. But as we search for answers, it is useful to keep in mind those fates that we would like to avoid.
The recent economic histories of four nations are noteworthy: France, Greece, Japan and Zimbabwe. Each illustrates a kind of policy mistake that could, if we are not careful, presage the future of the United States economy. Think of them as the four horsemen of the economic apocalypse.
Let's start with Zimbabwe. If there were an award for the world's worst economic policy, it might well have won it several times over the past decade. In particular, in 2008 and 2009, it experienced truly spectacular hyperinflation. Prices rose so fast that the central bank eventually printed 100 trillion-dollar notes for people to carry. The nation has since abandoned using its own currency, but you can still buy one of those notes as a novelty item for about $5 (American, that is).
Some may find it hard to imagine that the United States would ever go down this route. But reckless money creation is apparently a concern of Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, who is seeking the Republican nomination for president. He suggested in August that it would be "almost treasonous" if Ben S. Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, were to print too much money before the election. Mr. Perry is not alone in his concerns. Many on the right fear that the Fed's recent policies aimed at fighting high unemployment will mainly serve to ignite excessive inflation.
Mr. Bernanke, however, is less worried about the United States turning into Zimbabwe than he is about it turning into Japan.
Those old enough to remember the 1980s will recall that Japan used to be an up-and-coming economic superpower. Many people then worried (too much, in my view) that Japan's rapid growth was a threat to prosperity in the United States, in much the same way that many people worry today (too much, in my view) about rapid growth in China.
The concerns about Japanese hegemony came to a quick end after bubbles in the real estate and stock markets burst in the early 1990s. Since then, Japan has struggled to regain its footing. Critics of the Bank of Japan say it has been too focused on quelling phantom inflationary threats and insufficiently concerned about restoring robust economic growth.
One of those critics was Mr. Bernanke, before he became Fed chairman. Watching Japanese timidity and failures has surely made him more willing to experiment with unconventional forms of monetary policy in the aftermath of our own financial crisis.
The economists in the Obama administration are also well aware of the Japanese experience. That is one reason they are pushing for more stimulus spending to prop up the aggregate demand for goods and services.
Yet this fiscal policy comes with its own risks. The more we rely on deficit spending to keep the economy afloat, the more we risk the kind of sovereign debt crisis we have witnessed in Greece over the past year. The Standard & Poor's downgrade of United States debt over the summer is a portent of what could lie ahead. In the long run, we have to pay our debts -- or face dire consequences.
To be sure, the bond market doesn't seem particularly worried about the solvency of the federal government. It is still willing to lend to the United States at low rates of interest. But the same thing was true of Greece four years ago. Once the bond market starts changing its mind, the verdict can be swift, and can lead to a vicious circle of rising interest rates, increasing debt service and budget deficits, and falling confidence.
Bond markets are now giving the United States the benefit of the doubt, partly because other nations look even riskier, and partly in the belief that we will, in time, get our fiscal house in order. The big political question is how.
The nation faces a fundamental decision about priorities. To maintain current levels of taxation, we will need to substantially reduce spending on the social safety net, including Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and the new health care program sometimes called Obamacare. Alternatively, we can preserve the current social safety net and raise taxes substantially to pay for it. Or we may choose a combination of spending cuts and tax increases. This brings us to the last of our cautionary tales: France.
Here are two facts about the French economy. First, gross domestic product per capita in France is 29 percent less than it is in the United States, in large part because the French work many fewer hours over their lifetimes than Americans do. Second, the French are taxed more than Americans. In 2009, taxes were 24 percent of G.D.P. in the United States but 42 percent in France.
Economists debate whether higher taxation in France and other European nations is the cause of the reduced work effort and incomes there. Perhaps it is something else entirely -- a certain joie de vivre that escapes the nose-to-the-grindstone American culture.
We may soon be running a natural experiment to find out. If American policy makers don't rein in entitlement spending over the next several decades, they will have little choice but to raise taxes close to European levels. We can then see whether the next generation of Americans spends less time at work earning a living and more time sipping espresso in outdoor cafes.

Full text: You must unlearn what you have learned.
When mutual fund companies start quoting Yoda while trying to persuade you to hand over your money, it's a sure sign that something new is going on.
But Pimco, a bond specialist now selling the popular target-date retirement funds that blend stocks and bonds and become more conservative as you near retirement, would have you believe that it has a revolutionary approach to these funds, which populate most employers' 401(k) and other plans.
Pimco believes we are experiencing a "new normal," where markets in the future are much less likely to deliver the returns people remember from retirement investing in the 1980s and 1990s.
Plenty of people have ended up looking like idiots after declaring that this time is different, so it's tempting to dismiss their proclamations as a lot of hot air. But Pimco has created its RealRetirement target-date funds with a strategy that appears to be custom-built for these skittish times. There's less money in stocks, more inflation protection, hedging to protect against large losses and freedom for the Pimco fund managers to make bets on the fly.
For the period that began March 31, 2008, and ended in the middle of this month, Pimco's funds for people retiring in 2020 and 2040 outperformed each of the big three in the target-date arena, Fidelity, T. Rowe Price and Vanguard, according to Morningstar data.
Still, the margin of victory over the next best-performing fund was less than one-quarter of a percentage point annually in both cases. And as Yoda himself might put it, three years of returns matter not when worried you are about many decades of future.
That outperformance is something, though. So it's worth a peek under the hood to see what Pimco is up to.
But first, how did we get here? Target-date funds grew out of the utter lack of preparedness that many people felt when employers left pensions and made workers pick investments in a 401(k).
"People were given investment discretion when they didn't want it," said Joe Nagengast, a principal at Target Date Analytics, a research and consulting firm that does not work with Pimco but would like to someday. "The way to address that was to put everyone in these broad age buckets and say, 'For investment management purposes, we're not insulting your individuality but if you're 25, you are the same as every other 25-year-old.' "
So a 25-year-old today can invest in a 2050 fund with a high allocation of riskier assets like stocks. Over time, the fund would gradually switch to bonds and other more conservative investments that can reduce risk as retirement looms.
Pimco introduced some of its target-date funds right before the stock market fell to pieces in 2008, which dragged down many other companies' 2010 and 2015 target-date funds that had a lot of money in stocks. What Pimco had surmised was that one big loss near retirement would set many retirees back so far they'd have difficulty recovering. So it wanted to try to protect people from that.
"You only get one shot to do this properly," said Vineer Bhansali, the Pimco managing director who oversees the investment strategy behind the target-date funds. "Most participants don't worry so much about marginal underperformance as they do about underperforming significantly on the downside."
Mr. Bhansali has a Ph.D. in particle physics from Harvard, did time in the trenches on Wall Street and is qualified to fly all sorts of airplanes even when he can't see 100 feet in front of him. But he has no instruments for predicting returns, and he worries about once-in-a-while calamities like hyperinflation. "We believe that just like losing your money to someone who doesn't pay you back is a very immediate threat to your capital, so is a loss of buying power," he said. "It's the same thing. You can't buy stuff that you need."
One way Pimco tries to avoid that possibility is by gradually moving as much as 35 percent of the target-date portfolio to TIPS, which are United States Treasury bonds with built-in inflation protection. To avoid outsize stock market risk, Pimco's targets for its stock allocation are never higher than 55 percent.
Another big difference here are the hedges that Pimco has in place to protect against a collapse in the stock market. By using various complex tools, Pimco sets a maximum loss it is willing to tolerate. For a fund with a retirement date that is relatively soon, it wants no more than a 5 percent loss; for a retirement date that is much further away, it may be willing to suffer a 15 or 20 percent decline, though the targets can move some.
Opening the funds in early 2008 was the ultimate test for the strategy, given the enormous losses in stocks over the next year. "We were very nervous about whether it was going to work, but we never busted the boundaries," Mr. Bhansali said.
Hedging is not free, and its costs, which can range from roughly half of a percentage point to 1.25 percent annually, act as a drag on returns. Mr. Bhansali, however, argues that if the hedges work, he can sell options, say, that are more valuable when markets are in free fall and then use the proceeds to buy newly cheap investments. This, he believes, could enhance returns by a couple of percentage points annually over the long haul.
It had better, because as John Ameriks, who heads investment counseling and research for Vanguard notes, those hedging costs add up over time. "People fail to appreciate that the numbers come out of the returns every year," he said. "The math is not perfect, but you basically multiply the annual extra costs by the number of years, so at 1 percent annually you're losing 30 percent of your gains over 30 years."
All we know so far about returns are those three-year figures I cited above, which have Pimco's funds just barely beating its three biggest rivals, thanks in no small part to those hedges. But Pimco's reduced stock exposure really hurt it in the period starting March 1, 2009, when the stock market was near its nadir, and ending two years later after the markets had bounced back a fair bit. During that period, the Pimco 2020 fund trailed its rivals by about 6.5 to 12.5 percentage points annually while the 2040 fund trailed by roughly 3 to 7 percentage points, according to the Morningstar data.
Again, three years (or 30, even) are not enough to go on, though Mr. Ameriks of Vanguard takes his best shot at using the historical return of stocks to cast doubt on Pimco's approach. "Theirs is a very skeptical view of what equities will generate," he said. "I suppose one is entitled to take that view. But it's not consistent with longer-term history."
Pimco, for its part, doesn't want to be a slave to that history -- that is, to be in a situation where it is forced, because of strict fund rules, to do something that has resulted in good historical returns but may not lead to good prospective returns. So it gives itself plenty of leeway to shift the allocations, often by many percentage points. If you're an investor, this means you need to have a ton of faith in Mr. Bhansali and his team.
Or, you could take a fallback position -- that you're willing to earn a bit less with people who have their eyes on the downside. "We for sure don't have forecasting ability over 30 years," he said. "But you want to focus on things you can control, and one of those is risk. Do you really have the luxury of taking a risk from which you can't survive?"
So let's say you bet your retirement on this unproven model, which anyone can do, given that the Pimco funds are available through brokerage firms. And let's say you ignore the fact that few big employers have chosen so far to adopt the funds for their retirement plans, due to their lack of a long track record. And assume that these Pimco funds underperform competing funds by a percentage point or two each year over 30 years. What then?
Well, Pimco has its own downside covered here. Its research offers a sober piece of advice that just may solve all investors' problems, no matter whose fund family they adopt. Pimco, perhaps self-servingly, declares that people may need to save 20 percent of their pay to reach a goal of replacing just 40 to 60 percent of their income in retirement.
So there's your new normal ladies and gentlemen: 20 percent. Forget the inner workings of your target-date fund for a minute. How many of you can say that you even come close to meeting that standard?

Full text: Workers will be able to contribute more money to their 401(k) retirement plans next year, under new limits set by the Internal Revenue Service.
The I.R.S. is increasing the maximum annual contribution that employees can make, without paying upfront taxes, to $17,000. The increase, required by law to adjust for inflation, is $500 higher than this year's level. The ceiling hadn't been raised since 2009 because inflation had been too low to trigger an increase.
Five percent of the roughly 60 million 401(k) plan participants contribute the maximum amount, said David Wray, the president of the Plan Sponsor Council of America (formerly known as the Profit Sharing/401k Council of America). And roughly another 5 percent would contribute the maximum amount, if their companies let them, he said.
Companies that set up 401(k) plans for their employees can limit maximum contributions at levels below the legal ceiling. But only about 5 percent of companies do so, Mr. Wray said -- mostly because they have left in place limits that were once required by much older 401(k) rules, which capped contributions at 15 percent of an employee's salary. So, for instance, if your salary is $60,000, you can only contribute $9,000 a year to your 401(k).
About 30 percent of companies limit the 401(k) contributions of their highly paid executives, he said, because they must do so to comply with I.R.S. rules.
Thirty-three percent of workers age 21 to 64 used 401(k) plans in 2009, according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute. ANN CARRNS

Full text: Stocks rallied Friday after several large United States companies reported solid third-quarter earnings and as hope mounted that a weekend meeting would bring European leaders closer to easing the region's debt troubles.
Shares of McDonald's rose 3 percent after the company reported a 9 percent increase in income. The results beat analysts' expectations and represented the ninth straight quarter of gains for McDonald's.
Shares in Harman International Industries, the maker of audio equipment, jumped 18 percent, the most in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, after the company's income far exceeded analysts' expectations.
The encouraging corporate news was in line with recent signs that the United States economy strengthened in September after a very weak summer. On Friday the government said unemployment fell last month in half of the states and was unchanged in 11. That's much better than August, when unemployment rose in 26 states.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 267 points, or 2.3 percent, to 11,808.79. The Dow is now up 2 percent from the start of 2011. Before the surge on Friday, it was down again for the year.
The S.& P. 500 added nearly 23 points, or 1.9 percent, to 1,238.25. The Nasdaq composite index gained 39 points, or 1.5 percent, to 2,637.46.
The stronger earnings, better economic news and a sense that European officials were taking the debt crisis more seriously have helped lift stocks, said Philip J. Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors. "It seems like there's a greater sense of urgency to deal with Greece and the sovereign debt trouble in Europe," he said.
Traders are monitoring Europe's efforts to solve the Greek debt crisis. Worries about a default by Greece have been behind much of the market's volatility in recent months.
European markets closed sharply higher as investors hoped that European leaders would agree on a package of measures to address the region's debt crisis in time for a summit meeting scheduled tentatively for Wednesday.
Traders had hoped for a plan to be forged at a meeting on Sunday. But talks between France and Germany this week have broken down repeatedly. European officials said on Thursday that there would be no deal before a second summit meeting next week. The two countries disagree about the size of losses that private banks should take on Greek debt that they own, among other issues.
Traders sold ultra-safe United States Treasury debt as riskier assets rose. The Treasury's 10-year note fell 8/32, to 99 7/32, and the yield rose to 2.22 percent, from 2.19 percent late Thursday. Bond yields rise as demand for them falls and their prices decline.
Stocks were lifted early in the week by modestly better news about the United States economy. The number of people claiming unemployment benefits declined this week. Housing construction picked up last month, at least for apartment buildings, and inflation remains low.

Full text: The great Chinese-led deflation in goods prices may have come to an end.
Beginning in the 1990s, the emergence of China as a major exporter first depressed and then held down the prices of many goods, helping to improve living standards in the United States. But recently, prices have begun to rise.
The change can be seen clearly in the accompanying charts showing the Consumer Price Index for apparel. Because prices can be volatile, they use three-month moving averages to smooth the trends.
The chart above shows how prices have moved over the last two decades, from the end of 1991 through the September figures released this week. Prices are still well below where they were in 1991, a performance that no one would have expected at the time. Over the previous two decades, beginning in 1971, that index doubled.
But in the last few months, the index has begun to rise at the fastest rate in many years. This spring, prices were still about 9 percent lower than in late 1991. Now the prices are just 5 percent below the level of two decades ago.
A second chart shows the 12-month change in the index. It is now up to 3.6 percent, the highest since 1992. Over the last six months, the three-month average has risen at an annual rate of 7.6 percent.
Prices for apparel were broadly steady for most of the 1990s, before beginning a sharp descent in 1998 that continued until 2003. Much of the decline was because of imports from China, which forced down prices and allowed Chinese suppliers to supplant companies from many other countries. The declines continued at a slower pace for several more years, but prices now appear to have hit bottom in 2007.
When Chinese trade was helping to push down prices for many things, the reported low figures for inflation gave optimistic central bankers a reason to think that there was no need to slow rapid growth in the United States.
The continued monetary stimulus helped push unemployment rates down to the levels of the late 1950s. The underlying assumption was that technological innovations had produced a new economy that could boom without inflation.
The alternative explanation was that a substantial part of the reported low inflation came from imports of Asian, primarily Chinese, products, and that that effect was bound to be temporary. At some point, trade imbalances would become unsustainable and the inflation picture would reverse, as either the dollar lost value or costs began to rise in Asia.
That is what appears to have happened. Labor costs are rising in China. Some business is going to other countries, where wage rates are lower than in China. And some product prices are rising.
The excessively easy monetary policy helped lead to bubbles in the American economy, first in technology stocks and then, much more damaging, in housing. There was substantial inflation, even when import prices were falling, but it was in other parts of the economy.
The third chart shows the United States balance of payments -- largely determined by the trade surplus or deficit -- as a percentage of the country's gross domestic product. From a rough balance two decades ago, it deteriorated to a deficit of more than 6 percent of G.D.P. in 2006, before the economy began to stumble.
If the era of Chinese-led deflation has ended, the implications may be unfortunate for consumers, as the price of necessities rises even as the American economy continues to struggle along in a slow recovery from the recession of 2007 to 2009.

Full text: SHANGHAI -- Amid worries that local governments in China may be running short of cash, Beijing gave approval Thursday to a trial program that will allow the authorities in four regions to issue bonds.
The cities of Shanghai and Shenzhen, in southern China, as well as Zhejiang and Guangdong Provinces -- all fast-growing coastal areas -- were selected to take part in the program, according to a statement issued by the Ministry of Finance.
The decision comes at a time when the Chinese government is tightening credit in the hopes of taming inflation and a property bubble, and easing growth in the world's second largest economy after the United States.
That policy has begun to sting property developers, local governments that depend on land auctions for income and small and medium sized businesses, which often rely on high interest loans from underground banks.
There are also growing concerns that the Chinese banking system may be at risk because many local governments have amassed huge debts over the past three years by using undeveloped land as collateral.
And all of this is happening at a time when analysts expect slowdowns in Europe and the United States to also be felt in China, which has a huge export industry.
But the move Thursday was largely related to China's domestic issues, and the way in which it finances much of its growth.
China restricts local governments from issuing bonds, but does allow them to set up companies that raise money using land and other government assets as collateral. The governments have been aggressive in using local government financing vehicles -- whose debts do not show up on government budgets -- to build roads, bridges and other infrastructure projects.
The use of local government financing vehicles intensified in China after economic growth slowed in 2008, and Beijing began encouraging government stimulus packages to ramp up growth. The plan seemed to work, driving growth up to 10 percent in many parts of the country, but also fueling inflation and soaring property prices.
Now, there are concerns that the nation's state-run lenders are sitting on top of enormous debts, and that eventually Beijing will be forced to bailout the banks and local governments.
Officially, local government debt was about $1.7 trillion, or about 27 percent of the size the national economy, at the end of 2010. But that figure does not include central government debts for huge endeavors, like the nation's high-speed rail program.
A decade ago, Beijing was forced to bail out the big state-owned banks because many state-run companies were insolvent.
Shares of the biggest Chinese lenders have been slumping in recent months, partly because of concerns that the debts may be larger than the amounts the government has acknowledged.
Chinese banks have reported a relatively minor amount of nonperforming loans on their books, but analysts and investors either do not believe the figure or expect it to grow quickly in the coming two years.
Stephen Green, an economist at Standard Chartered, wrote in a report this week that Chinese banks "may need a pre-emptive bailout."
"China is not suffering a banking crisis now," Mr. Green wrote. "But there's growing cause for concern. The only way to avert more serious problems is a new wave of reform."
Liu Mingkang, the head of China's banking regulatory commission, acknowledged some of these problems in a speech that was posted on the regulator's Web site this week.
"Undeniably, the problems of irregular and imprudent management and lack of supervising mechanisms that exist in local government financing vehicles have created some hidden risks," he said.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Social Security recipients will get a 3.6 percent increase in benefits next year to help keep up with inflation, the first such cost-of-living adjustment in three years, the government announced Wednesday.
The automatic increase will begin with payments that go to nearly 55 million Social Security beneficiaries in January.
For retired workers, the average monthly benefit will increase by $43, to $1,229. That translates into annual income of $14,748, up $516 from this year.
Social Security is the major source of income for most Americans 65 and older, according to the agency that runs the program. It expects to pay $727 billion in benefits this year to retirees, people with disabilities, and surviving spouses and children.
As baby boomers retire, the number of beneficiaries will grow. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the annual cost of the program will climb by 75 percent in the next decade, reaching nearly $1.3 trillion in 2021.
The announcement of the benefit increase came as members of Congress look for ways to slow the growth of the program. Such proposals could be considered by a special joint committee of Congress seeking ways to reduce the federal budget deficit.
One option, discussed by the White House and Congressional Republicans over the summer, would calculate the annual update in benefits using an alternative measure of inflation, known as the "chain-weighted version" of the Consumer Price Index. The budget office says such a change could save more than $100 billion over 10 years.
Advocates for older Americans say the change would be tantamount to a backdoor cut in benefits. House Democrats, including two members of the committee on deficit reduction -- Representatives Xavier Becerra of California and Chris Van Hollen of Maryland -- opposed the idea when it came up earlier this year.
The House Democratic leader, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, said that any savings in Social Security should be used to strengthen the program, not to reduce the deficit.
Nancy LeaMond, an executive vice president of AARP, the lobby for middle-aged and older Americans, said the increase in benefits would provide some relief for people whose finances had been battered by a "decline in housing values, deep losses to retirement and savings accounts and skyrocketing health and prescription drug costs" in the last few years.
The Social Security Administration pointed out on Wednesday that for some beneficiaries, the increase in Social Security benefits next year "may be partially or completely offset by increases in Medicare premiums."
Social Security could be a political issue in campaigns for the White House and Congress. In September, at a debate among Republicans seeking the party's presidential nomination, Gov. Rick Perry of Texas talked about the need to shore up Social Security and referred to the program as a "Ponzi scheme." Mr. Perry was assailed by some of his Republican rivals and by Democrats, who promise to defend the program.
"Democrats created Social Security, and we will protect it," Ms. Pelosi said Wednesday. "We must reaffirm our fundamental commitment: to preserve and strengthen Social Security, not privatize it; to maintain this pillar of economic security, not undermine it."
Under federal law, the cost-of-living adjustment, intended to preserve the purchasing power of Social Security benefits, is based on the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for urban wage earners.
Social Security beneficiaries received an increase of 5.8 percent in 2009. No cost-of-living adjustments were provided in 2010 or 2011.
The recent increase in consumer prices has eroded the purchasing power of the wages paid to many workers under 65 who do not automatically receive cost-of-living adjustments in their paychecks.
Based on the increase in average wages, the maximum amount of earnings subject to the Social Security payroll tax will increase next year to $110,100, from $106,800.
More than eight million low-income people receiving Supplemental Security Income will also get a 3.6 percent increase in benefits next year. The standard federal payment will rise to $698 a month for an individual, from $674, and to $1,048 for a couple, from $1,011, the government said.

Full text: Hong Kong
After spending last week talking with Hong Kong entrepreneurs about a bill, just passed by the U.S. Senate, to clear the way for tariffs on Chinese exports to America if China doesn't revalue its currency, there are three things I have to say. One, I really hope the people pushing this bill do not give up. Two, I really hope the people pushing this bill do not succeed. And, three, I really hope no one thinks this legislation will make any sustainable dent in our unemployment problem, which requires much more radical rethinking.
I support this legislation in theory because China needs a wake-up call. I know, China never responds to in-your-face pressure -- not immediately. But it began revaluing its currency upward in 2005, the last time the Senate brandished a big stick. The fact is, China's strategy of using low wages and a cheap currency to build up an enormous export-led growth engine -- while using its huge market to lure and compel companies to transfer their next-generation technology to China as well -- is now hurting both sides.
China is spending tons of money manipulating its currency downward and, in the process, creating domestic inflation and a real estate bubble, which is weakening its competiveness. Meanwhile, it is hair-raising to hear stories in Hong Kong about the number of American companies feeling the need to transfer advanced technology to China under pressure from Beijing officials -- and being afraid to complain to Washington about unfair trade practices. Yes, China's leaders, fearing unemployment, will revalue their currency at their own pace. But if pushing this bill even marginally slows the pace of American firms shifting operations here, and gives others more time to adapt, it will be worth it.
But, Lord in heaven, do not let the House pass this bill. That would trigger a trade war in the middle of our Great Recession. We tried that in 1930. It didn't end well. Worse, today it would distract us from thinking about the real issue: How do we adjust our labor market to the simultaneous intensification of globalization and the I.T. revolution, the biggest thing happening in the world today? The intensification of globalization means more parts of any product or service can be produced anywhere, and the intensification of the I.T. revolution means more parts of any product or service can be created by machines and software.
I am typing this column on a Dell laptop that says "Made in China" on the bottom. In fact, it was assembled in China -- but the design, memory board, screen, casing and dozens of other parts were all made in other countries. And while the machine says "Made in China," the lion's share of its value and profit goes to the firm that conceived the idea and orchestrated that supply chain -- Dell Inc. in Texas.
We are never going to get those labor-intensive assembly jobs back from China -- the wage differentials are far too great, no matter how much China revalues its currency. We need to focus on multiplying more people at the high-value ideation and orchestration end of the supply chain, and in the manufacturing processes where one person can be highly productive, and well paid, by operating multiple machines. We need to focus on "Imagined in America" and "Orchestrated From America" and "Made in America by a smart worker using a phalanx of smarter robots." In total value terms, America still manufactures almost as much as China. We just do it with far fewer people, which is why we need more start-ups.
But we also need to stop thinking that a middle class can be sustained only by factory jobs. Thirty years ago, Hong Kong was a manufacturing center. Now its economy is 97 percent services. It has adjusted so well that this year the Hong Kong government is giving a bonus of $775 to each of its residents. One reason is that Hong Kong has transformed itself into a huge tourist center that last year received 36 million visitors -- 23 million from China. Their hotel stays, dining and jewelry purchases are driving prosperity here. The U.S. Commerce Department says 801,000 Mainland Chinese visited the U.S. last year, adding $5 billion to the U.S. economy. More Chinese want to come, but, for security reasons, visas are hard to obtain. If we let in as many Chinese tourists as Hong Kong, it would inject more than $115 billion into what is a highly unionized U.S. hotel, restaurant, gaming and tourism industry.
Another idea officials here offer is that the United States invites Chinese firms to invest in toll bridges, toll roads, and rail systems across the United States, in partnership with American companies. They could build them, and operate them for a set number of years, until their investment pays out, and then transfer them to full U.S. ownership. It may be the only way we can rebuild our infrastructure.
Yes, China manipulates its currency and market access. But the reason we are so vulnerable is that we have no leverage. We don't save; we overconsume; we don't plan; and we have not invested enough in infrastructure and education. Dealing with a superpower like China without leverage? Let me know how that works out for you.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Already facing the prospect of losing billions of dollars in revenue from cuts in government spending, federal contractors could also see limits on how much they can be paid in salary with federal funds.
Several lawmakers are asking the special debt-reduction committee to consider curbing the federal wages paid to top employees of government contractors to make them comparable with the salaries of federal employees. Currently, the top five employees of a company can be paid up to nearly $700,000 a year each in salary, bonuses and deferred compensation.
In a letter to the members of the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, Senators Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California, and Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, proposed lowering the cap to $200,000, and said that reining in the amount of money contractors can charge the government for salaries would help reduce the deficit by billions of dollars. In the House, the measure is being pushed by Representative Paul Tonko, Democrat of New York.
The recommendation made last week is similar to a salary cap proposed by President Obama last month in his own deficit reduction plan. The White House estimates that limiting the wages paid to contractors would save about $3 billion over a decade. Lawmakers say the proposal would not limit employee compensation from nongovernment revenue sources.
The proposed recommendation from Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Grassley and Mr. Tonko -- one of many being made to the panel by lawmakers -- would also expand the cap to cover all of a contractor's employees, not just the top employees. The lawmakers said that inflated contractor salaries were passed on to government through higher bids for goods and services. In their letter, the lawmakers said that from 1998 to 2010, the rate for contractor salaries grew 53 percent faster than the rate of inflation.
"It's excessive," Mr. Tonko said. "Taxpayer dollars should not be used as a reward for contractor executives, especially when other segments of society are hurting."
Federal contactors say they are opposed to any changes in the compensation rules.
"It's a good sound bite, but it doesn't work," said Stan Soloway, president of the Professional Services Council, a trade group in Arlington, Va., that represents government contractors. "This is not about contractors gouging the government. It's about the government getting top talent for the work it needs."
Mr. Soloway, who was a deputy under secretary for defense in the Clinton administration, said the government already had control over what was paid to contractors.
"The current rates represent the maximum that can be charged to the government, but the actual amount an individual company can charge to the government is tied directly to what the government determines is fair and reasonable," he said. "Not everyone is getting $700,000 in salary."
Mr. Soloway said lowering the amount that contractors could be paid would exacerbate a problem already experienced by government agencies -- keeping good people with government salaries.
Contractors' compensation is set by the Office of Federal Procurement Policy. The office decides how much in salaries and bonuses the government will reimburse a contractor, based on available surveys on executive pay at publicly traded United States companies with more than $50 million in annual sales, according to the agency.

Wholesale Prices Shot Up 0.8% In September, Fed by Gasoline

Full text: Producer prices in the United States rose in September at their fastest pace in five months and the cost of gasoline surged, but a small gain in core prices suggested that the increased price pressure was unlikely to be sustained.
The Labor Department said Tuesday that its seasonally adjusted index for prices received by farms, factories and refineries increased 0.8 percent after being flat in August.
Economists had expected prices to rise 0.2 percent.
Stripping out volatile food and energy prices, wholesale prices rose 0.2 percent after inching up 0.1 percent in August.
"Slower growth abroad suggests further moderation in demand for raw materials heading into the fourth quarter, which will likely translate into inflation moderation," said Lindsey Piegza, an economist at FTN Financial in New York.
Gasoline prices climbed 4.2 percent, the largest gain since March, after dropping 1 percent in August. Economists, however, dismissed the rise in the cost of gasoline, attributing it to how the data was adjusted to try to smooth seasonal volatility.
"It probably did not point to a new trend to higher inflation," said Gary Thayer, chief macro strategist at Wells Fargo Advisors in St. Louis.
But some said there was a risk that data on Wednesday could show a surprise in September consumer prices. The consumer price index most likely rose 0.3 percent last month, according to a Reuters survey, after increasing 0.4 percent in August.
The strong rise in wholesale prices last month is unlikely to prompt a broad increase in inflation pressures given the weak economy.
It will probably have little impact on the Federal Reserve, which focuses on core consumer inflation, as it weighs further options to help the anemic recovery and pull down an unemployment rate stuck above 9 percent.
Pressure on the central bank for further monetary stimulus has eased in recent weeks as retail sales and the trade balance data suggested that economic growth accelerated in the third quarter after the tepid 1.3 percent annual rate in the second quarter.
Economists estimate that gross domestic product grew at an annual pace of 2.3 percent to 2.7 percent in the third quarter.

Full text: The same things making many air travelers grumble these days -- rising fares with more and more fees, fewer flights, planes filled to the brim -- are the things giving airline executives a reason to smile.
After a decade of losing money because of cutthroat competition, slumping traveler demand and volatile fuel prices, the industry has found a way to regain control of its fortunes -- and make money -- by shelving its 1990s strategy of aggressive growth. Despite the weak economy, most domestic airlines will have their second consecutive profitable year in 2011, after losing $55 billion since 2001.
The one exception is American Airlines, which is set to report another quarterly loss on Wednesday. Once the largest airline in the United States, American has lost its top perch and is struggling with high costs and debt, and acrimonious labor relations.
American trails its top rivals after being left out of the major mergers that have consolidated the industry. These began with the purchase of Northwest by Delta Air Lines in 2008, which created the nation's biggest airline, and followed last year by the merger of United Airlines and Continental and the purchase of AirTran Airlines by Southwest Airlines. The mergers allowed the biggest airlines to cut service to many smaller markets, ground unprofitable flights and focus on their most profitable hubs. With fewer airlines competing to make their seats the cheapest, they could increase fares. The nation's top five airlines, including joint figures for United-Continental and Southwest-AirTran, accounted for 85 percent of all domestic seats in 2010; that compared with a 64 percent share for the top five in 2000, said Hunter Keay, an aviation analyst at Wolfe Trahan & Company.
"This has been an incredible picture over the past three years," Mr. Keay said. "It's not rocket science. Airlines finally understand basic economics. It's supply and demand. It's fear-based discipline."
Just looking at the number of seats available, domestic airlines' capacity peaked in 2005 and has generally fallen since. But the cuts have been even steeper when the number of seats is compared with the size of the economy, said John Heimlich, the chief economist for the Air Transport Association, the industry's main trade group. That ratio is at its lowest since 1979.
"The industry's survival over the past decade has necessitated a substantial degree of shrinkage," Mr. Heimlich said. "It's a combination of how oversupplied and under-demanded we've been and how tough the decade has been. That's an unfortunate result. Most businesses would rather see an entity grow profitably rather than shrink profitability."
With fewer scheduled flights, planes are now fuller than they have ever been. The percentage of filled seats on international and domestic flights rose to a record high of 81.9 percent in 2010, compared with 72.9 percent in 2000, according to figures compiled by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. And that number does not entirely capture how full most flights are to the most popular destinations at the most desirable times.
Meanwhile, the flight experience has worsened, as the big airlines have reduced service and stopped providing free meals or even blankets and pillows on flights. Legroom shrank on many of the low-cost airlines. Spirit Airlines, for instance, is now flying Airbus A320s with a seat pitch -- or the distance between seats -- of 28 inches. (A typical pitch at the other airlines is 31 inches.) That allows it to pack 178 passengers on these planes, 28 more than JetBlue, which flies similar planes, according to Matthew Daimler, the founder of SeatGuru.com.
Domestic fares, which have risen in recent years, averaged $337 last year. Adjusted for inflation, they are still nearly 30 percent lower today than they were in the mid-1990s, but the fare is only part of the price passengers pay today.
The airlines now generate extra revenue from passengers by charging for a variety of services and goods, including checked bags, priority seating and onboard items like food, television and blankets.
The fees can be confusing, with little consistency across airlines. American, Delta and Continental, for instance, charge $25 for the first checked bag, while AirTran charges $20 and Southwest and JetBlue charge nothing. Some airlines charge extra for exit row seats or to sit in the first few rows of coach. Some apply cancellation charges. Some provide satellite television free; others charge for it.
"The airlines are only catching up to other consumer businesses," said Richard H. Anderson, Delta's chairman and chief executive. "Look at rental car companies, which offer you GPS for a fee, or to fill up your car or have one-way drop charges. Look at hotels, where you pay for Wi-Fi, where you pay for the drinks in your room. You tailor your product to what the consumer wants. One thing we understand now is what our costs are when we price our products."
The new revenue has provided a critical shot in the arm and helped airlines cushion the impact of fuel costs, which now account for about 40 percent of the industry's fixed costs, up from 30 percent before 2005.
In 1990, tickets accounted for 88 percent of the airlines' passenger revenue. In 2010, that share dropped to 71 percent. The new revenue accounted for most of the difference. Bag fees alone brought in revenue of more than $784 million in the first quarter -- out of total revenue for the industry of $43 billion.
"The industry's ability to adapt to the harsh economic climate of 2009 is a great example of its willingness and ability to adapt," Barclays Capital analysts wrote in a recent industry report.
The airlines had little choice. In the decade after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, 41 airlines filed for bankruptcy. And the industry is still under significant stress. A slower economy could force passengers, especially business travelers, to travel less. Global business travel, which had been rebounding, fell in August compared with the same month last year, according to the International Air Transport Association.
Airline shares have suffered this year as a result of economic uncertainty. Shares of Delta and Southwest have lost a third of their value this year, while United is down 14 percent in that period.
American Airlines has been particularly hard hit because of growing investor concerns that it cannot weather yet another slump in travel and may have to file for bankruptcy protection, something it has persistently refused to do.
Shares in its parent company, the AMR Corporation, have lost 64 percent of their value this year. American recently said it had ordered 460 new single-aisle planes from Boeing and Airbus to rejuvenate its fleet with more fuel-efficient planes that are cheaper to operate. "Their turnaround plan is very ambitious, very expensive, and will take a decade to fully flesh out," Mr. Keay said. "The question is whether the macroeconomic environment will grant American that much time."
While many aviation executives and analysts say most airlines have a more solid financial foundation, they remain cautious, given how fragile the recovery has been.
"It's like the TV show 'The Biggest Loser,' where you just lost 25 pounds but you still weigh 220," said Steve Lott, a spokesman for the Air Transport Association, the trade group. "You might still be declared a winner, but are you really fit? I think we have a long way before we regain our financial health."

Full text: It seems a rare act of civic sacrifice: in the name of deficit reduction, lawmakers from both parties are calling for the end of a longstanding agricultural subsidy that puts about $5 billion a year in the pockets of their farmer constituents. Even major farm groups are accepting the move, saying that with farmers poised to reap bumper profits, they must do their part.
But in the same breath, the lawmakers and their farm lobby allies are seeking to send most of that money -- under a new name -- straight back to the same farmers, with most of the benefits going to large farms that grow commodity crops like corn, soybeans, wheat and cotton. In essence, lawmakers would replace one subsidy with a new one.
"We are very much aware of the budgetary constraints of the federal government," said Garry Niemeyer, an Illinois farmer who is president of the National Corn Growers Association. "We want to do our part as corn growers to help resolve those issues, but we only want to do our proportional part. We don't want to have everything taken out on us."
But Vincent H. Smith, a professor of farm economics at Montana State University, called the maneuver a bait and switch.
"There's a persistent story that farming is on the edge of catastrophe in America and that's why they need safety nets that other people don't get," he said. "And the reality is that it's really a very healthy industry."
The subsidy swap is gaining momentum as lawmakers seek to influence the cuts in farm programs that are expected to be made by a special Congressional panel charged with slashing $1.2 trillion from future budgets.
On Monday, leaders of the House and Senate agriculture committees said they were preparing recommendations for $23 billion in unspecified cuts over 10 years, far less than some other proposals.
Lawmakers' reluctance to simply eliminate a subsidy without adding another in its place demonstrates how difficult it is for Washington to trim the federal largess that flows to any powerful interest group. Indeed, the $5 billion program that lawmakers are willing to throw under the tractor, known as the direct payment program, was created in 1996 as a way to wean farmers off all such supports -- and instead was made permanent a few years later.
The new subsidy is being championed by Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, and Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota.
Mr. Thune, a leading voice in favor of deficit reduction, received at least $80,000 in campaign contributions since 2007 from political action committees associated with commodity agriculture, according to data compiled by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks campaign spending. Mr. Brown has received $5,500 in PAC contributions from such groups in that period.
It is unclear how much support a new subsidy would garner, since many lawmakers view farm programs as a likely source of budget savings.
Critics say that farm subsidies today have little to do with helping struggling family farmers. Instead, they go predominantly to well-financed operations with large landholdings. All told, the subsidies amount to about $18 billion a year -- about half of 1 percent of the federal budget.
An analysis of federal data by the Environmental Working Group, an advocacy group that tracks farm subsidies, showed that the top 10 percent of direct-payment recipients in 2010 received 59 percent of the money under the program. Those 88,000 people, including farmers, their spouses and absentee landowners, got an average of $29,598.
In lean times, such support might seem vital, but in recent years commodity farmers have done well.
The Agriculture Department forecasts that farm profits this year, measured on a cash basis, will total $115 billion, 24 percent higher than last year, thanks to soaring crop prices. Adjusted for inflation, profits are expected to be at their highest level since 1974.
The average income for farm households has been higher than general household incomes every year since 1996. The average household income was $87,780 for all farms in 2010, and $201,465 for families living on large farms.
"How do you justify this kind of money going to a sector of the economy that's booming while other folks in the country are suffering?" Craig Cox, a senior vice president of the Environmental Working Group, said of the subsidies.
Lobbyists and farm-state lawmakers have long argued that farmers face risks, like bad weather, pests and volatile markets, that merit special treatment.
Direct payments have come under fire, however, because farmers get them whether markets are high or low. The new subsidy, called shallow-loss protection, would act as a free insurance policy to cover commodity farmers against small drops in revenue.
Most commodity farmers already buy crop insurance to protect themselves against major losses caused by large drops in prices or damage to crops. Those policies typically guarantee 75 to 85 percent of a farmer's revenue, with the federal government spending $6 billion a year to pay more than half the cost of farmers' premiums.
The proposed new subsidy would add another layer of protection to guarantee 10 to 15 percent of a farmer's revenue, paying out not only in years of heavy losses, but also when revenue dipped less severely.
The shallow-loss plan getting the most attention is in a bill introduced last month by Senators Brown and Thune that would simplify and expand an existing program.
Gary D. Schnitkey, a professor of farm management at the University of Illinois, said the Brown-Thune plan would help protect farmers during longer periods of depressed prices. Without such a program, he said, "we would see financial stress and we would see farmers go out of business."
It is unclear how much the proposal would cost taxpayers. Dr. Schnitkey said the plan could pay farmers $40 billion over 10 years. That would be $20 billion less than the programs it replaced, including direct payments and some smaller subsidies.
But Dr. Smith, the Montana State economist, said the cost could be much greater because the plan used recent high crop prices as its benchmark.
"If farm prices move back towards what are widely viewed as more normal levels than their current levels, farmers will be compensated for going back to business as usual," he said.
In a statement Senator Thune said the proposal in the bill "corrects inefficiencies in several farm programs with a streamlined and cheaper approach."
Representative Marlin A. Stutzman, an Indiana Republican, said that a shallow-loss plan would give farmers more flexibility in managing risk. "Farmers shouldn't have to pay the brunt of the deficit problem," he said.
Mr. Stutzman and Senator Richard Lugar, also an Indiana Republican, included the Brown-Thune plan in matching farm bills they introduced this month.
Congress is due to write a new five-year farm bill next year, but some lawmakers want to use the deficit-cutting process to revamp farm spending. President Obama has proposed cutting $33 billion from farm programs over 10 years, including ending direct payments without adding a shallow-loss program. Mr. Stutzman's bill would slice $40 billion, with more than half coming from programs like food stamps and soil and water conservation.

Full text: As the Occupy Wall Street movement continues to grow, the response from the movement's targets has gradually changed: contemptuous dismissal has been replaced by whining. (A reader of my blog suggests that we start calling our ruling class the "kvetchocracy.") The modern lords of finance look at the protesters and ask, Don't they understand what we've done for the U.S. economy?
The answer is: yes, many of the protesters do understand what Wall Street and more generally the nation's economic elite have done for us. And that's why they're protesting.
On Saturday The Times reported what people in the financial industry are saying privately about the protests. My favorite quote came from an unnamed money manager who declared, "Financial services are one of the last things we do in this country and do it well. Let's embrace it."
This is deeply unfair to American workers, who are good at lots of things, and could be even better if we made adequate investments in education and infrastructure. But to the extent that America has lagged in everything except financial services, shouldn't the question be why, and whether it's a trend we want to continue?
For the financialization of America wasn't dictated by the invisible hand of the market. What caused the financial industry to grow much faster than the rest of the economy starting around 1980 was a series of deliberate policy choices, in particular a process of deregulation that continued right up to the eve of the 2008 crisis.
Not coincidentally, the era of an ever-growing financial industry was also an era of ever-growing inequality of income and wealth. Wall Street made a large direct contribution to economic polarization, because soaring incomes in finance accounted for a significant fraction of the rising share of the top 1 percent (and the top 0.1 percent, which accounts for most of the top 1 percent's gains) in the nation's income. More broadly, the same political forces that promoted financial deregulation fostered overall inequality in a variety of ways, undermining organized labor, doing away with the "outrage constraint" that used to limit executive paychecks, and more.
Oh, and taxes on the wealthy were, of course, sharply reduced.
All of this was supposed to be justified by results: the paychecks of the wizards of Wall Street were appropriate, we were told, because of the wonderful things they did. Somehow, however, that wonderfulness failed to trickle down to the rest of the nation -- and that was true even before the crisis. Median family income, adjusted for inflation, grew only about a fifth as much between 1980 and 2007 as it did in the generation following World War II, even though the postwar economy was marked both by strict financial regulation and by much higher tax rates on the wealthy than anything currently under political discussion.
Then came the crisis, which proved that all those claims about how modern finance had reduced risk and made the system more stable were utter nonsense. Government bailouts were all that saved us from a financial meltdown as bad as or worse than the one that caused the Great Depression.
And what about the current situation? Wall Street pay has rebounded even as ordinary workers continue to suffer from high unemployment and falling real wages. Yet it's harder than ever to see what, if anything, financiers are doing to earn that money.
Why, then, does Wall Street expect anyone to take its whining seriously? That money manager claiming that finance is the only thing America does well also complained that New York's two Democratic senators aren't on his side, declaring that "They need to understand who their constituency is." Actually, they surely know very well who their constituency is -- and even in New York, 16 out of 17 workers are employed by nonfinancial industries.
But he wasn't really talking about voters, of course. He was talking about the one thing Wall Street still has plenty of thanks to those bailouts, despite its total loss of credibility: money.
Money talks in American politics, and what the financial industry's money has been saying lately is that it will punish any politician who dares to criticize that industry's behavior, no matter how gently -- as evidenced by the way Wall Street money has now abandoned President Obama in favor of Mitt Romney. And this explains the industry's shock over recent events.
You see, until a few weeks ago it seemed as if Wall Street had effectively bribed and bullied our political system into forgetting about that whole drawing lavish paychecks while destroying the world economy thing. Then, all of a sudden, some people insisted on bringing the subject up again.
And their outrage has found resonance with millions of Americans. No wonder Wall Street is whining.

Abstract: [...] rebalancing" the economy is a prominent goal in China's new five-year economic plan.

Full text: The Senate's vote on Tuesday to punish China for cheapening its currency is not likely to persuade Beijing to change its ways. On Thursday, the renminbi actually fell more against the dollar. If the currency bill were to become law -- a long shot given opposition by Republican leaders in the House -- the more likely response from China would be some form of trade policy retaliation.
That is not an argument for doing nothing. But the United States and its allies need to find better ways to persuade China to change policies that are both battering the global economy and damaging its own development.
An artificially cheap currency is hurting China in many ways. The Peterson Institute for International Economics estimates that it costs China's central bank $240 billion a year -- more than its entire trade surplus -- because it requires amassing huge reserves in dollars that are gradually losing value against the renminbi. And to buy United States Treasury bonds for its reserves, the central bank must issue domestic bonds that pay a higher rate of interest, losing money in the process.
This leads to other costs. To keep domestic interest rates as low as possible in order to reduce its losses, the central bank has forced bank deposit rates below the inflation rate, eating into the savings of ordinary Chinese and inhibiting spending. The cheap currency also drives inflation by making imports more expensive. And low interest rates are creating a bubble in housing and corporate investment.
For all these costs, China gets remarkably few jobs from its export-led strategy, which increasingly relies on mechanization to produce more sophisticated goods. Employment has grown by only 1 percent per year since 2004 despite G.D.P. growth of 10 percent.
And an export-dependent strategy is not sustainable with faltering global demand. China's exports fell in the third quarter, suggesting foreign consumers are too spent to keep buying even China's artificially cheap goods and keep sustaining China's growth.
For China to develop further, it must rely more on its own consumers to buy its products and services. To get its citizens to spend more, the government must go beyond undoing the financial distortions -- like artificially depressed interest rates that encourage huge savings. It should invest more in social goods, like its pension and health insurance programs, to encourage families to reduce their just-in-case savings and spend more.
Many Chinese officials realize this. In fact, "rebalancing" the economy is a prominent goal in China's new five-year economic plan. The currency has been allowed to rise 7 percent against the dollar since June of 2010. Yet in late August the rise slowed to a virtual halt. Analysts fear that China is returning to its old playbook to support its exports amid a faltering global economy.
We have no sympathy for the desire of China's autocrats to stifle political freedoms, but their fear that a swift change in course could lead to social and political upheaval is legitimate. Even if China's leaders were persuaded of the need to change, it could not happen overnight. If the currency rose too fast, it would slash exports, bankrupt many firms and increase joblessness. Other needed components of reform -- like raising interest rates and freeing credit from state control -- could bankrupt firms and banks if done too abruptly.
In June, a report by the International Monetary Fund argued that, alone, a 20 percent revaluation of the Chinese currency would do little to improve the trade balances of its largest trading partners, including the United States. It recommended a reform package for China that included letting the renminbi rise at a brisker pace, allowing interest rates to rise, expanding social spending and allowing workers to move freely in search of better jobs.
A more expensive renminbi is part of the answer for China and its trading partners. But the trade problem won't really be addressed until China's consumers start saving less and spending more -- including on American products.

Full text: Steven Rattner is a contributing writer to Op-Ed and a former counselor to the secretary of the Treasury and lead auto adviser. He has spent nearly 30 years on Wall Street.
FOR the typical American, the past decade has been economically brutal: the first time since the 1930s, according to some calculations, that inflation-adjusted incomes declined. By 2010, real median household income had fallen to $49,445, compared with $53,164 in 2000. While there are many culprits, from declining unionization to the changing mix of needed skills, globalization has had the greatest impact.
Yes, globalization. The phenomenon that free traders like me adore has created a nation of winners (think of those low-priced imported goods) but also many losers. Nowhere have these pressures been more intense than in the manufacturing sector, which I saw firsthand as head of President Obama's Auto Task Force.
A typical General Motors worker costs the company about $56 per hour, which includes benefits. In Mexico, a worker costs the company $7 per hour; in China, $4.50 an hour, and in India, $1 per hour. While G.M. doesn't (yet) achieve United States-level productivity in China and India, its Mexican plants are today at least as efficient as those in the United States.
G.M. has responded with inarguable logic. While reducing its United States hourly work force to 50,000 from 89,000 over the past five years, its Mexican hourly head count has risen, to 9,235 from 9,073.
Pressed by high unemployment and eager to keep jobs in this country, the United Auto Workers agreed that companies could cut their costs by hiring some workers at $14 an hour, with lower benefits. Most recently, Volkswagen arrived in Chattanooga, Tenn., with 2,000 much-welcomed jobs -- but all with starting pay of $14.50 per hour. At this pay rate, although some workers will quickly exceed it at that plant, yearly income would be $30,000 per year, hardly the American dream of great middle-class jobs.
In these troubled times, any jobs are surely welcome. But we need to reverse the decline in incomes, and this requires a more thoughtful approach than the pervasive, politically attractive happy talk nostalgically centered on restoring lost manufacturing jobs.
So let's start by acknowledging that just as occurred decades ago with agriculture, the declining role in our economy of manufacturing, which over the last half-century is down from 32 percent of the work force to 9 percent, will continue. Let's also recognize that retreating into protectionism would turn a win-lose into a lose-lose.
And even if organized labor could force wage rates back up, that would hardly help domestic manufacturing compete against lower-cost imports.
Instead, we should follow the example of successful high-wage exporters in concentrating on products where we have an advantage, as Germany has done with products like sophisticated machine tools.
While America still leads in sectors like defense and aviation, our greatest strength, and a source of high-paying jobs, lies in service industries with high intellectual content, like education, entertainment, digital media, and yes, even financial services. Facebook, Google and Microsoft are all American creations, as are the global credit card companies American Express, Visa and MasterCard.
Achieving higher wages also requires a greater commitment to education; wages for those with college degrees rose 1.4 percent between 2000 and 2010, after inflation. Following the German model of greater emphasis on engineering and technical training would also be advantageous.
Finally comes the tricky question of what role government should play. The prospect of Washington lurching into the private sector is terrifying, as illustrated by the debacle of Solyndra, the solar energy company that failed with $535 million of taxpayer loans. While countries like China have put large resources behind industries they want to nurture, we should resist the temptation to plunge deeply into industrial policy. Particularly in its current dysfunctional condition, Washington is ill-equipped to pick winners and should concentrate its capital on infrastructure and other public investments that the private sector won't make.
To assist the private sector, particularly young companies, which are the biggest source of new hiring, tax incentives could be used to foster the creation of well-paying jobs.
In addition, the Kauffman Foundation, which focuses on entrepreneurship, has identified other possible solutions, including providing visas to entrepreneurs, easing access to public financing markets and reform of the patent and regulatory apparatus. Sadly, Congress shows little sign of addressing all of this.
With global competition and its pressure on American wages intensifying, American workers deserve a more focused approach from Washington.

Full text: Not long ago, someone suggested that I read "Since Yesterday," a book by Frederick Lewis Allen, a popular historian of the 1930s and 1940s. Published in 1940, it turned out to be a shrewd, concise, wonderfully written account of America in the '30s.
It also turned out to be something else: a reminder of why history matters. It is impossible to read "Since Yesterday" without reflecting, again and again, on the parallels between then and now. The Great Depression, of course, dominates the book -- and is far worse than anything we've been through. Still, when Allen writes about Ivar Kreuger, the industrialist who built an empire that some considered a Ponzi scheme, you instantly think of Bernie Madoff. The country's fixation with the Lindbergh kidnapping seems strikingly similar to the country's fixation with Casey Anthony.
And when Allen describes "Hooverville" -- a large encampment of war veterans demanding promised bonus payments -- Occupy Wall Street springs to mind. The veterans, who had gathered in a park near the Capitol, were treated well at first, but were eventually routed by the Army in a brutal show of force.
In "Since Yesterday," bankers are vilified; homes are foreclosed on; people desperately search for work -- just like today. Businessmen speak of the need for "confidence," a word that "enters the vocabulary only when confidence is lacking." Elsewhere Allen writes, "No longer were vital economic decisions made at international conferences of bankers; now they were made only by the political leaders of states."
Allen makes the surprising point that, while small business suffered terribly during the Great Depression, big corporations did well. When large companies needed to lay off workers to maintain profitability, they did so ruthlessly. Bursts of economic growth, however, were rarely accompanied by an increase in employment. Why? Because new technology allowed companies to increase productivity at the expense of workers. Just like today.
What dominates "Since Yesterday" -- as it must dominate any history of the Great Depression -- is the government's responses to the crisis. Herbert Hoover was "leery of any direct governmental offensive against the Depression," writes Allen. "So he stood aside and waited for the healing process to assert itself, as according to the hallowed principles of laissez-faire economics it should." Sticking to his convictions, Hoover allowed the country to sink deeper and deeper into Depression, becoming in the process one of its victims -- "along with the traditional economic theories of which he was the obstinate and tragic spokesman."
Then came Roosevelt, untethered to any economic theory and willing to try anything to get people back to work. Allen describes the alphabet soup of agencies he created, the deficits he generated, the regulations he enacted. The economy, which bottomed out in 1932, steadied and then began to grow until, by 1937, it appeared that the Great Depression had ended.
Allen then takes us through the terrible days of late 1937, when the economy collapsed again. "Roosevelt's Depression," businessmen called it, blaming it on a business tax they particularly loathed. In fact, Allen makes the convincing case that the real problem was that Roosevelt had tried to do something business wanted: balance the budget. Shrinking government spending dried up demand. And not until the following spring, when he reversed course and decided to "go in for heavy spending again," did conditions begin to improve.
The tragedy of Washington today, as the supercommittee begins its task of finding $1.2 trillion in cuts, is that nobody seems to remember the lessons of "Since Yesterday" -- and most other books about the Great Depression.
Cutting deficits always sounds good. Certainly, nobody wants the inflation that runaway deficits can produce. But in a depressed economy, cutting spending can lead to deflation, which is every bit as ruinous. To read "Since Yesterday" at this particular moment -- with the economy hanging in the balance, with President Obama's jobs program already voted down in the Senate, with fiscal policy so stubbornly focused on the wrong things -- is to fear that we are headed for worse times ahead, not better times.
Toward the end of his book, Allen sums up the mood of the country. By 1939, people were weary of hard economic times, but they were also weary of Roosevelt's endless experiments. Many modern historians believe that Roosevelt's biggest problem was not that he'd done too much, but that he'd done too little -- that the Depression required a response bigger than even Roosevelt's New Deal. Implicitly, Allen agrees with that.
Still, he writes, "Despite all the miseries of the Depression and the recurrent fears of new economic decline and of war, the bulk of the American people had not yet quite lost their basic asset of hopefulness."
He concludes: "A nation tried in a long ordeal had not yet lost heart." When our current long ordeal finally ends, will we be able to say the same?

Abstract: China has allowed its currency, the renminbi, to appreciate slightly more quickly this autumn as a way to make imports cheaper and control inflation, although most economists still say the currency is undervalued and the Senate approved legislation this week to make it easier for companies to obtain tariffs on Chinese imports that may benefit from China's daily intervention in currency markets to hold down the value of the renminbi.

Full text: HONG KONG -- Inflation slowed slightly for consumers last month in China and slowed a little more at factories, as stringent controls on bank lending and a gradually strengthening currency began to tame strongly rising prices, data released by the Chinese government on Friday showed.
But consumer prices still rose rapidly for the most politically significant category, food, with prices up 13.4 percent last month from a year earlier, the same as in August, although down from a peak of 14.8 percent in July.
Over all, consumer prices were up 6.1 percent in September from a year earlier, compared with increases of 6.2 percent for August and a peak of 6.5 percent in July. Prime Minister Wen Jiabao conceded in early summer that China would not meet its goal of keeping consumer inflation below 4 percent this year.
But producer prices, measured at the factory gate, showed a more pronounced pull back last month, which could be a sign of moderating inflation in the months to come. Producer prices were up 6.5 percent in September from a year earlier, compared with 7.3 percent in August and a peak of 7.5 percent in July.
China has allowed its currency, the renminbi, to appreciate slightly more quickly this autumn as a way to make imports cheaper and control inflation, although most economists still say the currency is undervalued and the Senate approved legislation this week to make it easier for companies to obtain tariffs on Chinese imports that may benefit from China's daily intervention in currency markets to hold down the value of the renminbi. Slowing inflation together with weakening overseas demand has prompted some economists to warn that China may now put the brakes on renminbi appreciation, which could aggravate tensions with the United States.

Full text: Reading the transcript of Tuesday's Republican debate on the economy is, for anyone who has actually been following economic events these past few years, like falling down a rabbit hole. Suddenly, you find yourself in a fantasy world where nothing looks or behaves the way it does in real life.
And since economic policy has to deal with the world we live in, not the fantasy world of the G.O.P.'s imagination, the prospect that one of these people may well be our next president is, frankly, terrifying.
In the real world, recent events were a devastating refutation of the free-market orthodoxy that has ruled American politics these past three decades. Above all, the long crusade against financial regulation, the successful effort to unravel the prudential rules established after the Great Depression on the grounds that they were unnecessary, ended up demonstrating -- at immense cost to the nation -- that those rules were necessary, after all.
But down the rabbit hole, none of that happened. We didn't find ourselves in a crisis because of runaway private lenders like Countrywide Financial. We didn't find ourselves in a crisis because Wall Street pretended that slicing, dicing and rearranging bad loans could somehow create AAA assets -- and private rating agencies played along. We didn't find ourselves in a crisis because "shadow banks" like Lehman Brothers exploited gaps in financial regulation to create bank-type threats to the financial system without being subject to bank-type limits on risk-taking.
No, in the universe of the Republican Party we found ourselves in a crisis because Representative Barney Frank forced helpless bankers to lend money to the undeserving poor.
O.K., I'm exaggerating a bit -- but not much. Mr. Frank's name did come up repeatedly as a villain in the crisis, and not just in the context of the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill, which Republicans want to repeal. You have to marvel at his alleged influence given the fact that he's a Democrat and the vast bulk of the bad loans now afflicting our economy were made while George W. Bush was president and Republicans controlled the House with an iron grip. But he's their preferred villain all the same.
The demonization of Mr. Frank aside, it's now obviously orthodoxy on the Republican side that government caused the whole problem. So what you need to know is that this orthodoxy has hardened even as the supposed evidence for government as a major villain in the crisis has been discredited. The fact is that government rules didn't force banks to make bad loans, and that government-sponsored lenders, while they behaved badly in many ways, accounted for few of the truly high-risk loans that fueled the housing bubble.
But that's history. What do the Republicans want to do now? In particular, what do they want to do about unemployment?
Well, they want to fire Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve -- not for doing too little, which is a case one can make, but for doing too much. So they're obviously not proposing any job-creation action via monetary policy.
Incidentally, during Tuesday's debate, Mitt Romney named Harvard's N. Gregory Mankiw as one of his advisers. How many Republicans know that Mr. Mankiw at least used to advocate -- correctly, in my view -- deliberate inflation by the Fed to solve our economic woes?
So, no monetary relief. What else? Well, the Cheshire Cat-like Rick Perry -- he seems to be fading out, bit by bit, until only the hair remains -- claimed, implausibly, that he could create 1.2 million jobs in the energy sector. Mr. Romney, meanwhile, called for permanent tax cuts -- basically, let's replay the Bush years! And Herman Cain? Oh, never mind.
By the way, has anyone else noticed the disappearance of budget deficits as a major concern for Republicans once they start talking about tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy?
It's all pretty funny. But it's also, as I said, terrifying.
The Great Recession should have been a huge wake-up call. Nothing like this was supposed to be possible in the modern world. Everyone, and I mean everyone, should be engaged in serious soul-searching, asking how much of what he or she thought was true actually isn't.
But the G.O.P. has responded to the crisis not by rethinking its dogma but by adopting an even cruder version of that dogma, becoming a caricature of itself. During the debate, the hosts played a clip of Ronald Reagan calling for increased revenue; today, no politician hoping to get anywhere in Reagan's party would dare say such a thing.
It's a terrible thing when an individual loses his or her grip on reality. But it's much worse when the same thing happens to a whole political party, one that already has the power to block anything the president proposes -- and which may soon control the whole government.

Abstract: In the preceding boom years, disruptive technologies like the transcontinental railroad and refrigeration brought prolonged downward pressure on prices. Since America was on a gold standard, this resulted in about 20 percent deflation in consumer prices.

Full text: Equities jumped 10 percent on the day three years ago when China said it would buy up bank shares in the market. They barely budged after a similar announcement on Monday. The difference is credibility. A sustained financial crisis has shown that governments around the world have a limited ability to make things better.
Beijing has a lot of credibility to lose. The country's economy has grown at near double-digit rates for decades. China also managed the first wave of the global financial crisis more successfully than most developed countries. In 2008, its stock purchases were followed by a $585 billion fiscal stimulus. Gross domestic product growth hardly slowed, despite a sharp drop in exports to developed countries.
But the Chinese stimulus, like most extreme fiscal and monetary measures, had its downside. The flood of money encouraged capital misallocation, stimulated property speculation, nurtured shady nonbank lending and worsened inflation. Now, investors, no longer sure the government is in control, fear more stimulus will aggravate the financial tensions.
China is a latecomer to the global trend of lost official credibility. After four years of rolling financial crises and disappointing growth in developed countries, it is hard for investors, or voters, to trust any official claim that a healthy order will soon be restored. Developing nations have had fewer economic problems, but China is following Brazil, which has discouraged foreign capitalists with repeated efforts to control the value of its currency.
The authorities are struggling for two reasons. First, they try to please too many constituencies. Various promises are made to soothe the rich, the poor, businessmen, bankers and foreign investors. They cannot all be kept happy, so everyone feels let down much of the time. Second, the experts are at a loss. No one knows how to deleverage and rebalance economies without tremendous dislocations in trade, investment and employment. The authorities are driving in the dark without headlights.
The lost credibility is a great shame. And one thing experts do know is that prosperity is harder to maintain when governments are perceived as untrustworthy.
History on Repeat?
The Occupy Wall Street protesters may not know much about Coxey's Army. But like the current demonstrations, Jacob Coxey's 1894 march on Washington occurred after a period of economic turmoil that increased inequality and followed a crash of the financial system. Mr. Coxey failed, but his demands of stimulus spending and printing money became the standard response to recessions. Occupy Wall Street should be so lucky.
Economically, the lead-up to 1894 bore considerable resemblance to the present. In the preceding boom years, disruptive technologies like the transcontinental railroad and refrigeration brought prolonged downward pressure on prices. Since America was on a gold standard, this resulted in about 20 percent deflation in consumer prices. As in the past decade, when American manufacturing workers saw their living standards eroded and employment opportunities diminish, farmers of the late 19th century were especially adversely affected, and income differentials widened.
The financial crash of 1893 resembled that of 2008, with similar distress in the financial sector, but caused more corporate bankruptcies and higher unemployment. It also brought a severe credit problem. To avoid running out of gold in early 1895, America sought a bailout from J. P. Morgan.
Mr. Coxey, a successful businessman with Populist Party connections, began his march with about 100 participants from his hometown of Massillon, Ohio. They demanded federal deficit spending on roads and other public works, with laborers paid in paper money, thus expanding the currency in circulation.
A generation before John Maynard Keynes espoused his theories, the protesters found little response to their ideas in the conservative administration of Grover Cleveland. The march was eventually dispersed with little short-term effect. Mr. Coxey's prescriptions, however, have since become conventional wisdom, notably in the fiscal and monetary responses to the most recent downturn.
Occupy Wall Street arises from a similar situation, when technology-driven deflation has widened income gaps and produced a stratum of economic losers. In that respect, it does not resemble, say, 1932, when distress was general, or even 1968, a period of great prosperity. But like Mr. Coxey's followers, Occupy Wall Street could influence the debate for decades ahead. It just needs some ideas.

Full text: CORRECTION APPENDED
Wall Street closed higher on Wednesday, after a new plan was unveiled to recapitalize European banks and a deal was struck in Slovakia that is expected to permit the creation of a larger, more powerful euro zone bailout fund.
Some traders say that the market is gaining momentum from its recent gains and have begun pointing to signs that the market's extreme volatility may be giving way to a calmer period. But with all eyes on Europe, even optimists acknowledge the fragility of the recent confidence.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 102.55 points, or 0.9 percent, at 11,518.85. It spent much of the day in positive territory for the year before giving up some of its gains in the last hour.
The index was positive for most of the year before plunging in early August. Since then, stock prices have experienced a series of wrenching ups and downs, closing in positive territory for the year only once.
The index closed on Wednesday 0.5 percent below its level at the beginning of 2011.
The Standard and Poor's 500-stock index, seen as a more complete barometer of the overall market, was up 11.71 points, or 1 percent, at 1,207.25. It remains down more than 3 percent for the year. The Nasdaq composite index rose 21.70 points, or 0.8 percent, to 2,604.73.
Banks continued to make particularly strong gains. Citigroup gained 4.9 percent, while Wells Fargo's shares were up 3.5 percent.
The European Commission president, Jose Manuel Barroso, proposed that Europe's biggest banks be required to temporarily bolster their protection against losses, as part of a broader plan to restore confidence in the European financial system. He also called on the 17 European Union members that use the euro to maximize the capacity of their bailout fund, a clear hint that he favors leveraging the fund to increase its power.
Slovakia is expected to approve changes to the rescue fund, known as the European Financial Stability Facility, on Thursday or Friday.
Lawmakers there initially rejected the bill shortly after markets in the United States closed on Tuesday. The vote led to the collapse of the country's coalition government, but the parties in the departing government reached an accord with the main opposition party to permit the bill to pass in exchange for early elections.
The other 16 E.U. members that use the euro have approved the measure, which requires unanimous support.
Analysts said recent turmoil in the markets had effectively forced European leaders to show real progress in addressing problems related to sovereign debt.
"The market has screamed loud enough to make the European authorities stand up and listen," said Andrew Wilkinson, chief economic strategist for Miller Tabak & Company.
Some traders also pointed to the falling level of the VIX, which measures volatility, as a sign that markets could be stabilizing. The VIX, popularly known as the fear index, ended at 31.26, its lowest level since mid-September. In addition to positive signs in Europe, the markets were adjusting to a slightly brighter picture of the domestic economy, said Michael Church, president of Addison Capital. A recent spate of economic data has eased fears among economists that a recession is imminent.
"At some point you had to question that thesis, especially when it had become exceptionally popular," Mr. Church said.
The minutes from the most recent Federal Open Market Committee meeting were released on Wednesday. They showed that two members had favored more aggressive action to stimulate the economy, essentially putting fears of a further slowdown ahead of inflation concerns.
European markets closed higher Wednesday. The benchmark Euro Stoxx 50 index was up 2.43 percent; the FTSE 100 in London rose 0.85 percent; and the DAX in Frankfurt gained 2.2 percent.
The euro, which has been gaining against the dollar for over a week, rose 1.1 percent to $1.3677.
Yields on United States Treasuries also continue to rise. The yield on the benchmark 10-year note was 2.21 percent, up from 2.16 late Tuesday.

Online Correction: October 12, 2011, Wednesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this article erroneously reported the yield on the 30-year bond -- rather than the 10-year note -- as 2.214 percent.

Full text: JILIN CITY, China -- Wang Jianping and his wife, Shue, are a relatively affluent Chinese couple, with an annual household income of $16,000 -- more than double the national average for urban families.
They own a modest, three-bedroom apartment here in this northeastern industrial city. They paid for their son to study electrical engineering at prestigious Tsinghua University, in Beijing. And even by frugal Asian standards, they are prodigious savers, with $50,000 in a state-run bank.
But like many other Chinese families, the Wangs feel pressed. They do not own a car, and they rarely go shopping or out to eat. That is because the value of their nest egg is shrinking, through no fault of their own.
Under an economic system that favors state-run banks and companies over wage earners, the government keeps the interest rate on savings accounts so artificially low that it cannot keep pace with China's rising inflation. At the same time, other factors in which the government plays a role -- a weak social safety net, depressed wages and soaring home prices -- create a hoarding impulse that compels many people to keep saving anyway, against an uncertain future.
Indeed, economists say this nation's decade of remarkable economic growth, led by exports and government investment in big projects like China's high-speed rail network, has to a great extent been underwritten by the household savings -- not the spending -- of the country's 1.3 billion people.
This system, which some experts refer to as state capitalism, depends on the transfer of wealth from Chinese households to state-run banks, government-backed corporations and the affluent few who are well enough connected to benefit from the arrangement.
Meanwhile, striving middle-class families like the Wangs are unable to enjoy the full fruits of China's economic miracle.
"This is the foundation of the whole system," said Carl E. Walter, a former J. P. Morgan executive who is co-author of "Red Capitalism: The Fragile Financial Foundation of China's Extraordinary Rise."
"The banks make loans to who the Communist Party tells them to," Mr. Walter said. "So they punish the household savers in favor of the state-owned companies."
It is not just China's problem. Economists say that for China to continue serving as one of the world's few engines of economic growth, it will need to cultivate a consumer class that buys more of the world's products and services, and shares more fully in the nation's wealth.
But rather than rising, China's consumer spending has actually plummeted in the last decade as a portion of the overall economy, to about 35 percent of gross domestic product, from about 45 percent. That figure is by far the lowest percentage for any big economy anywhere in the world. (Even in the sleepwalking American economy, the level is about 70 percent of G.D.P.)
Unless China starts giving its own people more spending power, some experts warn, the nation could gradually slip into the slow-growth malaise that now afflicts the United States, Europe and Japan. Already this year, China's economic growth rate has begun to cool off.
"This growth model is past its sell-by date," says Michael Pettis, a professor of finance at Peking University and senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. "If China is going to continue to grow, this system will have to change. They're going to have to stop penalizing households."
The Communist Party, in its latest five-year plan, has promised to bolster personal consumption. But doing so would risk undermining a pillar of the country's current financial system: the household savings that support the government-run banks.
Here in Jilin City, where chemical manufacturing is the dominant industry, the state banks are flush with money from savings accounts. The banks use that money to make low-interest loans to corporate beneficiaries -- including real estate developers, helping fuel a speculative property bubble that has raised housing prices beyond the reach of many consumers. It is a dynamic that has played out in dozens of cities throughout China.
Meanwhile, China's central bank in Beijing also depends on the nation's vast pool of consumer savings to help finance its big investments in the foreign exchange markets, as a way to keep the currency artificially weak. The weak currency helps sustain China's mighty export economy by lowering the global price of Chinese goods. But it also makes imports unaffordable for many Chinese people.
News reports of the nouveaux riches in Beijing and Shanghai snapping up Apple iPhones, Gucci bags and Rolex watches may conjure Western business dreams of China's becoming the world's biggest consumer market. But consumer choice here in Jilin and many other heartland cities is confined largely to the limited offerings of dingy state-run department stores and mom-and-pop shops. Any sales of global "brands" come mainly in the form of the counterfeits and knockoffs often sold at outdoor markets.
On a recent weekday at the Henan Street flea market, crowds sifted through stacks of clothes that included $3 T-shirts with images of Minnie Mouse and $5 imitation Nike sports jerseys. Just a few yards away, an authentic Nike store selling the real thing for $35 had nary a shopper. Because consumers have so little spending power, many global-brand companies do not even bother to open stores in cities like Jilin.
With the faltering economies of the United States, Europe and Japan limiting China's ability to continue relying on growth through exports, the Chinese government knows the importance of giving its own consumers more buying power. Already, the central government has pushed to raise rural incomes and has even offered subsidies to buy cars and household appliances.
The question is whether the government can change its entrenched economic system enough to truly make a difference. "The central government is committed to increasing the share of consumption in G.D.P.," says Li Daokui, a professor of economics at Tsinghua University and a longtime government adviser. "The issue is what is going to be the means."
THE SAVERS
Frugality Born
Of Necessity
If China is to make consumer spending a much larger share of the economy, it will need to encourage big changes in the habits of people like Mr. Wang, 52, a highway design specialist, and Ms. Wang, also 52, who retired as an accountant seven years ago because of health problems.
"We're quite traditional," says Ms. Wang, who draws a pension. "We don't like to spend tomorrow's money today."
But tomorrow's money may not be worth as much as today's -- not as long as their savings account earns only a 3 percent interest rate while inflation lopes along at 6 percent or more.
Yet the Wangs see no good alternatives to stashing nearly two-thirds of their monthly income in the bank. They are afraid to invest in China's notoriously volatile stock market. And Chinese law sharply limits their ability to invest overseas or otherwise send money outside the country.
Nor do the Wangs feel flush or daring enough to join the real estate speculation that some Chinese now see as one of the few ways to get a return on their money -- risky as that might prove if the bubble bursts.
Mainly, like many in China, the Wangs save because they worry about soaring food prices and the high cost of health care, which the People's Republic no longer fully provides. They also worry about whether they can afford to buy a home for their son, a cost that Chinese parents are expected to bear when their male children marry.
"If you have a daughter, it's not so expensive," Wang Shue said. "But with a son you have to save money."
Housing prices have become crucial in pushing up savings rates. Here, too, analysts say government policies are shifting wealth away from households.
In the case of the Wangs, they are being forced to move to make way for a new real estate development authorized by municipal authorities -- the sort of project that local governments throughout China have come to regard as an easy source of riches.
Although the Wangs and other current residents have received some cash compensation for the apartments they are leaving, the Jilin City government has sold the land to a developer that plans to demolish the current dwellings and erect a new complex with more, and more expensive, apartments.
The Wangs are not sure they will be able to find a home comparable to their current apartment from the money they are being paid. But the developer and the local government are expected jointly to earn a profit of more than $50 million.
A POLICY'S HISTORY
Averting a Crisis,
But Forming a Habit
Why would China, which hopes eventually to surpass the United States as the world's biggest economy, deliberately suppress the consumer market that might help it reach that goal?
Some analysts trace the current policies to habits formed in the late 1990s. That's when the bloat of China's giant, uncompetitive state-run corporations nearly brought China's economic expansion to a standstill. Suddenly, with state-owned companies facing bankruptcy, the state banks were saddled with hundreds of billions of dollars in nonperforming loans; many banks faced insolvency.
To avert a crisis, Beijing allowed state-owned companies to lay off tens of millions of workers. In 1999 just one of those companies, the parent of PetroChina, a big oil conglomerate, announced the layoff of a million employees. And to shore up the banks, Beijing assumed tighter control over interest rates, which included sharply lowering the effective rates paid to depositors. A passbook account that might have earned 3 percent in 2002, after inflation, would today be effectively losing 3 to 5 percent, once inflation is factored in.
That is how Chinese banks can provide extremely cheap financing to state-owned companies while still recording huge profits. It has also helped the banks provide easy financing for big public works projects, which besides the high-speed train system have included the 2008 Beijing Olympics and the monumental Three Gorges Dam.
It was during this same period that the Communist government discarded the longstanding "iron rice bowl" promise of lifelong employment and state care. Beijing shifted more of the high costs of social services -- including housing, education and medical care -- onto households and the private sector.
Together, these measures added up to the managed-market system now known as state capitalism. They worked so well that they not only helped resuscitate China's failing banks and state companies, but also fueled the nation's economic boom for more than a decade. But the system also took an enormous economic toll on personal pocketbooks.
"We'd like to spend, but we really have nothing left over after paying the bills," said Yang Yang, 34, a school administrator who lives in Jilin City with her husband, a police officer, and their son, 10. "Even though our son goes to a public school, we need to pay fees for after-school courses, which everyone is expected to take. Almost every family will do this. So there's a lot of pressure on us to do it, too." To save money, Ms. Yang, her husband and son recently moved in with her parents.
Nicholas R. Lardy, an economist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, calculates that the government policies exacted a hidden tax on Chinese households that amounted to about $36 billion in 2008 alone -- or about 4 percent of China's gross domestic product. Over the last decade, Mr. Lardy says, that figure probably amounted to hundreds of billions of dollars -- money that banks essentially took from consumers' hands.
The distortions may have actually cost households far more, because his figures do not include hidden costs like artificially high prices for imports.
For many Chinese economists, the state capitalism that helped jump-start growth has become counterproductive.
"China is already beyond the point where the law of diminishing returns starts biting," said Xu Xiaonian, an economist who teaches at the China Europe International Business School in Shanghai.
Mr. Xu argues that China risks repeating the mistakes Japan made in the 1980s and early 1990s, when it relied too long on a predominantly export economy, neglected domestic markets and allowed real estate prices to soar. Since Japan's bubble burst in the mid-1990s, its economy has never really recovered.
"If we don't change, we will follow those same footsteps," Mr. Xu said. "We have already seen the early signs of what we might call the Japanese disease. China invests more and more, but those investments generate less and less growth."
PREDICTIONS FOR CHANGE
A Radical Overhaul,
But Within Reach
Some economists predict major changes, noting that the Chinese government has the cash and the power to alter course as drastically as it did in the late '90s, this time in the people's favor.
"China has faced more daunting challenges in the past," said Wei Shangjin, a professor at the Columbia Business School. "I don't doubt that they want to do it. The question is, Can they successfully engineer such a major restructuring of the economy?"
Certainly, multinationals like McDonald's, Nike and Procter & Gamble are still betting billions of dollars that China will grow into the world's biggest consumer market within a few decades.
But raising consumption will require a radical overhaul of the Chinese economy -- not just weaning state banks off household subsidies but forcing state-run firms to pay much higher borrowing rates. It would also mean letting the currency rise closer to whatever value it might naturally reach. It would mean, in other words, a significant dismantling of the state capitalism that has enabled China to come so far so fast. "To get consumption to surge," said Mr. Pettis, the Peking University lecturer, "you need to stop taking money from the household sector."

Abstract: In the recession, the average length of time a person who lost a job was unemployed increased to 24.1 weeks in June 2009, from 16.6 weeks in December 2007, according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. Since the end of the recession, that figure has continued to increase, reaching 40.5 weeks in September, the longest in more than 60 years.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- In a grim sign of the enduring nature of the economic slump, household income declined more in the two years after the recession ended than it did during the recession itself, new research has found.
Between June 2009, when the recession officially ended, and June 2011, inflation-adjusted median household income fell 6.7 percent, to $49,909, according to a study by two former Census Bureau officials. During the recession -- from December 2007 to June 2009 -- household income fell 3.2 percent.
The finding helps explain why Americans' attitudes toward the economy, the country's direction and its political leaders have continued to sour even as the economy has been growing. Unhappiness and anger have come to dominate the political scene, including the early stages of the 2012 presidential campaign.
President Obama recently called the economic situation "an emergency," and over the weekend he assailed Congressional Republicans for opposing his jobs bill, which includes tax cuts that would raise take-home pay. Republicans blame Mr. Obama for the slump, saying he has issued a blizzard of regulations and promised future tax increases that have hurt business and consumer confidence.
Those arguments may be heard repeatedly this week, as the Senate begins debating the jobs bill. The full bill -- a mix of tax cuts, public works, unemployment benefits and other items, costing $447 billion -- is unlikely to pass, but individual parts seem to have a significant chance.
The full 9.8 percent drop in income from the start of the recession to this June -- the most recent month in the study -- appears to be the largest in several decades, according to other Census Bureau data. Gordon W. Green Jr., who wrote the report with John F. Coder, called the decline "a significant reduction in the American standard of living."
That reduction occurred even though the unemployment rate fell slightly, to 9.2 percent in June compared with 9.5 percent two years earlier. Two main forces appear to have held down pay: the number of people outside the labor force -- neither working nor looking for work -- has risen; and the hourly pay of employed people has failed to keep pace with inflation, as the prices of oil products and many foods have jumped.
During the recession itself, by contrast, wage gains outpaced inflation.
One reason pay has stagnated is that many people who lost their jobs in the recession -- and remained out of work for months -- have taken pay cuts in order to be hired again. In a separate study, Henry S. Farber, an economics professor at Princeton, found that people who lost jobs in the recession and later found work again made an average of 17.5 percent less than they had in their old jobs.
"As a labor economist, I do not think the recession has ended," Mr. Farber said. "Job losers are having more trouble than ever before finding full-time jobs."
Mr. Farber added that this downturn was "fundamentally different" from most previous ones. Historically, other economists say, financial crises and debt-caused bubbles have led to deeper, more protracted downturns.
Mr. Green and Mr. Coder said the persistently high rate of unemployment and the long duration of unemployment helped explain the decline in income during the recovery.
In the recession, the average length of time a person who lost a job was unemployed increased to 24.1 weeks in June 2009, from 16.6 weeks in December 2007, according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. Since the end of the recession, that figure has continued to increase, reaching 40.5 weeks in September, the longest in more than 60 years.
The new study by Mr. Green and Mr. Coder is based on monthly census surveys, rather than the annual data that appeared in last month's census report on income. The monthly figures allow researchers to measure income changes more precisely during a recession or a recovery and provide more current information. The annual report is based on surveys conducted early in the following year, and people sometimes confuse how much money they are making at the time of the survey with how much they made the previous year. Additionally, recessions usually do not line up with a calendar year.
A committee of academic economists at the National Bureau of Economic Research, a private group widely considered the arbiter of the business cycle, judged that the most recent recession began in December 2007. The bureau defines a recession as a significant, broad-based decline in economic activity.
The economists said the recession ended in June 2009. In every quarter since then, the economy has grown.
Some economists see signs that the United States may be in or about to enter another recession, though the evidence is mixed.
In their new study, Mr. Green and Mr. Coder found that income dropped more, in percentage terms, for some groups already making less, a factor that they say may have contributed to rising income inequality.
From June 2007 to June of this year, they said, median annual household income declined by 7.8 percent for non-Hispanic whites, to $56,320, and by 6.8 percent for Hispanics, to $39,901. For blacks, household income declined 9.2 percent, to $31,784.
Mr. Green and Mr. Coder, who both worked at the Census Bureau for more than 25 years, found other income changes over the four-year period examined.
For example, income, after adjustment for inflation, declined fairly substantially for households headed by people under age 62, but it rose 4.7 percent for those headed by people 65 to 74, many of whom are not in the labor force. The change was negligible for those 62 to 64.
The type of employment also made a difference. Real median annual income declined to a similar degree for households headed by private-sector wage workers (4.3 percent) and government-sector workers (3.9 percent), but fell much more for the self-employed (12.3 percent).
Family households generally had larger declines in real income than other households. Men living alone showed a bigger decline than women living alone.
Education levels were also a factor. Median annual income declined most for households headed by someone with an associate's degree, dropping 14 percent, to $53,195, in the four-year period that ended in June 2011, the report said.
For households headed by people who had not completed high school, median income declined by 7.9 percent, to $25,157. For those with a bachelor's degree or more, income declined by 6.8 percent, to $82,846.

Abstract: Economists often distinguish between cyclical trends and secular trends -- which is to say, between short-term fluctuations and long-term changes in the basic structure of the economy. The bursting of a generation-long, debt-enabled consumer bubble has left households rebuilding their balance sheets and businesses wary of hiring until they are confident that consumer spending will pick up.

Full text: David Leonhardt is The New York Times Washington bureau chief.
UNDERNEATH the misery of the Great Depression, the United States economy was quietly making enormous strides during the 1930s. Television and nylon stockings were invented. Refrigerators and washing machines turned into mass-market products. Railroads became faster and roads smoother and wider. As the economic historian Alexander J. Field has said, the 1930s constituted "the most technologically progressive decade of the century."
Economists often distinguish between cyclical trends and secular trends -- which is to say, between short-term fluctuations and long-term changes in the basic structure of the economy. No decade points to the difference quite like the 1930s: cyclically, the worst decade of the 20th century, and yet, secularly, one of the best.
It would clearly be nice if we could take some comfort from this bit of history. If anything, though, the lesson of the 1930s may be the opposite one. The most worrisome aspect about our current slump is that it combines obvious short-term problems -- from the financial crisis -- with less obvious long-term problems. Those long-term problems include a decade-long slowdown in new-business formation, the stagnation of educational gains and the rapid growth of industries with mixed blessings, including finance and health care.
Together, these problems raise the possibility that the United States is not merely suffering through a normal, if severe, downturn. Instead, it may have entered a phase in which high unemployment is the norm.
On Friday, the Labor Department reported that job growth was mediocre in September and that unemployment remained at 9.1 percent. In a recent survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, forecasters said the rate was not likely to fall below 7 percent until at least 2015. After that, they predicted, it would rarely fall below 6 percent, even in good times.
Not so long ago, 6 percent was considered a disappointingly high unemployment rate. From 1995 to 2007, the jobless rate exceeded 6 percent for only a single five-month period in 2003 -- and it never topped 7 percent.
"We've got a double-whammy effect," says John C. Haltiwanger, an economics professor at the University of Maryland. The cyclical crisis has come on top of the secular one, and the two are now feeding off each other.
In the most likely case, the United States has fallen into a period somewhat similar to the one that Europe has endured for parts of the last generation; it is rich but struggling. A high unemployment rate will feed fears of national decline. The political scene may be tumultuous, as it already is. Many people will find themselves shut out of the work force.
Almost 6.5 million people have been officially unemployed for at least six months, and another few million have dropped out of the labor force -- that is, they are no longer looking for work -- since 2008. These hard-core unemployed highlight the nexus between long-term and short-term economic problems. Most lost their jobs because of the recession. But many will remain without work long after the economy begins growing again.
Indeed, they will themselves become a force weighing on the economy. Fairly or not, employers will be reluctant to hire them. Many with borderline health problems will end up in the federal disability program, which has become a shadow welfare program that most beneficiaries never leave.
For now, the main cause of the economic funk remains the financial crisis. The bursting of a generation-long, debt-enabled consumer bubble has left households rebuilding their balance sheets and businesses wary of hiring until they are confident that consumer spending will pick up. Even now, sales of many big-ticket items -- houses, cars, appliances, many services -- remain far below their pre-crisis peaks.
Although the details of every financial crisis differ, the broad patterns are similar. The typical crisis leads to almost a decade of elevated unemployment, according to oft-cited academic research by Carmen M. Reinhart and Kenneth S. Rogoff. Ms. Reinhart and Mr. Rogoff date the recent crisis from the summer of 2007, which would mean our economy was not even halfway through its decade of high unemployment.
Of course, making dark forecasts about the American economy, especially after a recession, can be dangerous. In just the last 50 years, doomsayers claimed that the United States was falling behind the Soviet Union, Japan and Germany, only to be proved wrong each time.
This country continues to have advantages that no other country, including China, does: the world's best venture-capital network, a well-established rule of law, a culture that celebrates risk taking, an unmatched appeal to immigrants. These strengths often give rise to the next great industry, even when the strengths are less salient than the country's problems.
THAT'S part of what happened in the 1930s. It's also happened in the 1990s, when many people were worrying about a jobless recovery and economic decline. At a 1992 conference Bill Clinton convened shortly after his election to talk about the economy, participants recall, no one mentioned the Internet.
Still, the reasons for concern today are serious. Even before the financial crisis began, the American economy was not healthy. Job growth was so weak during the economic expansion from 2001 to 2007 that employment failed to keep pace with the growing population, and the share of working adults declined. For the average person with a job, income growth barely exceeded inflation.
The closest thing to a unified explanation for these problems is a mirror image of what made the 1930s so important. Then, the United States was vastly increasing its productive capacity, as Mr. Field argued in his recent book, "A Great Leap Forward." Partly because the Depression was eliminating inefficiencies but mostly because of the emergence of new technologies, the economy was adding muscle and shedding fat. Those changes, combined with the vast industrialization for World War II, made possible the postwar boom.
In recent years, on the other hand, the economy has not done an especially good job of building its productive capacity. Yes, innovations like the iPad and Twitter have altered daily life. And, yes, companies have figured out how to produce just as many goods and services with fewer workers. But the country has not developed any major new industries that employ large and growing numbers of workers.
There is no contemporary version of the 1870s railroads, the 1920s auto industry or even the 1990s Internet sector. Total economic output over the last decade, as measured by the gross domestic product, has grown more slowly than in any 10-year period during the 1950s, '60s, '70s, '80s or '90s.
Perhaps the most important reason, beyond the financial crisis, is the overall skill level of the work force. The United States is the only rich country in the world that has not substantially increased the share of young adults with the equivalent of a bachelor's degree over the past three decades. Some less technical measures of human capital, like the percentage of children living with two parents, have deteriorated. The country has also chosen not to welcome many scientists and entrepreneurs who would like to move here.
The relationship between skills and economic success is not an exact one, yet it is certainly strong enough to notice, and not just in the reams of peer-reviewed studies on the subject. Australia, New Zealand, Canada and much of Northern Europe have made considerable educational progress since the 1980s, for instance. Their unemployment rates, which were once higher than ours, are now lower. Within this country, the 50 most educated metropolitan areas have an average jobless rate of 7.3 percent, according to Moody's Analytics; in the 50 least educated, the average rate is 11.4 percent.
Despite the media's focus on those college graduates who are struggling, it's not much of an exaggeration to say that people with a four-year degree -- who have an unemployment rate of just 4.3 percent -- are barely experiencing an economic downturn.
Economic downturns do often send people streaming back to school, and this one is no exception. So there is a chance that it will lead to a surge in skill formation. Yet it seems unlikely to do nearly as much on that score as the Great Depression, which helped make high school universal. High school, of course, is free. Today's educational frontier, college, is not. In fact, it has become more expensive lately, as state cutbacks have led to tuition increases.
Beyond education, the American economy seems to be suffering from a misallocation of resources. Some of this is beyond our control. China's artificially low currency has nudged us toward consuming too much and producing too little. But much of the misallocation is homegrown.
In particular, three giant industries -- finance, health care and housing -- now include large amounts of unproductive capacity. Housing may have shrunk, but it is still a bigger, more subsidized sector in this country than in many others.
Health care is far larger, with the United States spending at least 50 percent more per person on medical care than any other country, without getting vastly better results. (Some aspects of our care, like certain cancer treatments, are better, while others, like medical error rates, are worse.) The contrast suggests that a significant portion of medical spending is wasted, be it on approaches that do not make people healthier or on insurance-company bureaucracy.
In finance, trading volumes have boomed in recent decades, yet it is unclear how much all the activity has lifted living standards. Paul A. Volcker, the former Fed chairman, has mischievously said that the only useful recent financial innovation was the automated teller machine. Critics like Mr. Volcker argue that much of modern finance amounts to arbitrage, in which technology and globalization have allowed traders to profit from being the first to notice small price differences.
IN the process, Wall Street has captured a growing share of the world's economic pie -- thereby increasing inequality -- without doing much to expand the pie. It may even have shrunk the pie, given that a new International Monetary Fund analysis found that higher inequality leads to slower economic growth.
The common question with these industries is whether they are using resources that could do more economic good elsewhere. "The health care problem is very similar to the finance problem," says Lawrence F. Katz, a Harvard economist, "in that incredibly talented people are wasting their talent on something that is essentially a zero-sum game."
In the short term, finance, health care and housing provide jobs, as their lobbyists are quick to point out. But it is hard to see how the jobs of the future will spring from unnecessary back surgery and garden-variety arbitrage. They differ from the growth engines of the past, which delivered fundamental value -- faster transportation or new knowledge -- and let other industries then build off those advances.
The United States has long overcome its less dynamic industries by replacing them with more dynamic ones. The decline of the horse and buggy, difficult as it may have been for people in the business, created no macroeconomic problems. The trouble today is that those new industries don't seem to be arriving very quickly.
The rate at which new companies are created has been falling for most of the last decade. So has the pace at which existing companies add positions. "The current problem is not that we have tons of layoffs," Mr. Katz says. "It's that we don't have much hiring."
If history repeats itself, this situation will eventually turn around. Maybe some American scientist in a laboratory somewhere is about to make a breakthrough. Maybe an entrepreneur is on the verge of creating a great new product. Maybe the recent health care and financial-regulation laws will squeeze the bloat.
For now, the evidence for such optimism remains scant. And the economy remains millions of jobs away from being even moderately healthy.

Abstract: A 14.7 percent increase in the minimum wage is scheduled to take effect in 2012 at a cost of $13 billion, new low-income housing subsidies will cost $6 billion, and investments for the sporting events are expected to cost at least $4.5 billion, said Luiz Schymura, director of the Brazilian Economic Institute at the Getulio Vargas Foundation in Rio de Janeiro. Since her inauguration in January, Ms. Rousseff has shown a willingness to take a red pen to fiscal spending.

Full text: SAO PAULO, Brazil -- In the first major test of her stewardship of Latin America's largest economy, President Dilma Rousseff is struggling to break free of an economic trap.
Coming off a year in which it recorded its highest growth in a quarter century, Brazil is faced with rising inflation, an overvalued currency and an industrial sector losing competitiveness to cheap Chinese imports.
But Ms. Rousseff's promising efforts to fix those problems could be undermined in the coming months as the government embarks on one of its biggest spending sprees in decades.
The leaders of the United States and Europe, struggling to right their listing economies, would count themselves lucky to have problems like Brazil's. Its economy -- driven by soaring prices for commodities, robust Chinese demand for raw materials and a domestic consumption boom spurred on by expanding credit -- grew 7.5 percent last year, its highest rate since 1986.
"Like other emerging countries, Brazil has thus far been less affected by the global crisis," Ms. Rousseff, an economist, said at the United Nations last month. "But we know that our capacity to resist is not unlimited."
Her strategy so far has been bold. Predicting that the global economy will not improve this year, Brazil's Central Bank has slashed interest rates, making a risky bet that already high inflation would not soar further. That move, aimed at encouraging growth and reducing the value of the currency, was paired with measures to protect Brazil's industries from a flood of Asian imports.
That approach has shown early signs of success. The stubbornly high Brazilian real began losing value to the dollar last month, reaching its lowest point since 2008 two weeks ago before recovering somewhat last week.
The shift has been front-page news in Brazil, dampening a buoyancy among Brazilians who felt richer than ever. Even as the overvalued currency slowed industrial production, it fueled consumer spending at home and abroad at a blistering pace.
The average per capita purchases by Brazilians in the United States grew 250 percent between 2003 and 2010. Only the Japanese and the British spend more in the United States than Brazilians, figures from the United States Commerce Department show. The foreign spending, which diverts money that could support Brazilian industry, has alarmed government officials here, who have tried to slow the pace of consumption by imposing restrictions on credit card purchases.
But government spending represents the bigger threat.
Next year, the government will be obligated to meet tens of billions of dollars in promised payments for social welfare programs, minimum wage increases and infrastructure projects for its twin billing on the global stage, the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
A 14.7 percent increase in the minimum wage is scheduled to take effect in 2012 at a cost of $13 billion, new low-income housing subsidies will cost $6 billion, and investments for the sporting events are expected to cost at least $4.5 billion, said Luiz Schymura, director of the Brazilian Economic Institute at the Getulio Vargas Foundation in Rio de Janeiro.
Since her inauguration in January, Ms. Rousseff has shown a willingness to take a red pen to fiscal spending. Her government approved $28 billion in budget cuts, privatized airports -- a move considered long overdue by economists and many policy makers -- and stood up to unions demanding even higher wage increases.
But standing up to the minimum wage or the World Cup may be politically impossible.
"For all her good intentions, the political pressures on her will be enormous," Dr. Schymura said.
The surge in spending, accompanied by lower interest rates, could produce a cycle of higher inflation, economists fear. Whether the new policies will be enough to revitalize Brazil's industrial sector remains to be seen. The economy's growth has slowed this year to about 3.5 percent, economists say, about half that of last year. And the consumption boom is slowing. Housing, grocery and retail stores are all reporting reduced sales, said Alfredo Coutino, director for Latin America at Moody's Analytics.
"Now everybody is questioning if the consumption boom was sustainable or not, because everybody is losing now," he said. "The future in Brazil is not certain, or at least not as certain as believed at the beginning of the year."
There are also concerns that structural shifts are under way that will continue to stymie growth. Industry's share of total economic production has been slipping, to 15.4 percent last year from 19.2 percent in 2004, government figures show.
"Some people say that Brazil is immersed in a de-industrialization process," Dr. Coutino said.
The government has moved aggressively to protect industry, saying last month that it would raise import taxes on foreign cars and trucks by 30 percentage points to protect jobs in Brazil's flagging auto industry.
Brazilian industry pins its decline on the overvalued real, which reduced demand for Brazilian products, and for that Finance Minister Guido Mantega blames the United States and China for exacerbating a "currency war."
But the real has also strengthened because of high interest rates, which have attracted a heavy influx of dollars from overseas investors. Brazil's benchmark interest rate of 12 percent -- which was slashed in August from 12.5 percent -- remains among the highest in the world.
The government is determined not to repeat past mistakes. After the September 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers, Brazil waited four months to begin cutting interest rates. The surprise cut in August came as inflation climbed to a six-year high, and more cuts could be coming.
"As the financial crisis worsens, this time we will take advantage of it," Ms. Rousseff said to business leaders here last month.
Despite the moves, analysts fear that Ms. Rousseff will pay a political price for Brazil's economic dip.
When former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva was re-elected to a second term in 2006, Brazil's economy was taking off. His government's approval ratings steadily soared, topping 80 percent in some polls as he left office on Jan. 1.
Ms. Rousseff, his chosen successor, was elected last October just as Brazil's economy was starting to overheat, with another global slowdown months away. But so far she has not mustered the same political support that Mr. da Silva enjoyed, and she has struggled to contain unrest in her governing coalition. Five ministers have resigned in the past four months, the latest being Pedro Novais, the tourism minister, who stepped down last month amid allegations of ethics violations.
Ms. Rousseff "is embarking upon a politically more difficult path precisely when her base of support in Congress could start to wane and her approval ratings are more likely to drop over the next four to six months," said Christopher Garman, an analyst at Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy in New York.
"She is embarking upon a bold strategy," he said, "but she won't be able to fully deliver on that strategy."

QUESTIONS ON THE REACH
OF IRAN'S INFLUENCE IN IRAQ
As the United States draws down its forces in Iraq, fears abound that Iran will simply move into the vacuum and extend its already substantial political influence more deeply through the soft powers of culture and commerce. Iran has emerged empowered in Iraq over the last eight years, and it has a sympathetic Shiite-dominated government to show for it, but for what so far are rather obscure reasons, it has been unable to extend its reach.

BRAZIL PRESIDENT'S CHALLENGE
In the first major test of her stewardship of Latin America's largest economy, President Dilma Rousseff is struggling to break free of an economic trap. Coming off a year in which it recorded its highest growth in a quarter century, Brazil is faced with rising inflation, an overvalued currency and an industrial sector losing competitiveness to cheap Chinese imports.

MEN ACCUSED OF TERROR PLOT
Indonesian police arrested three men and accused them of plotting two suicide attacks in the last six months that injured scores of people. A National Police spokesman, Maj. Gen. Anton Bachrul Alam, announced the arrest of one man, Heru Komarudin, at a market in central Jakarta. Mr. Komarudin, 31, is wanted for plotting a suicide bombing in April at a mosque in a police compound in the West Java town of Cirebon. Page 6
LAWMAKERS END BOYCOTT
More than a month had passed since dozens of lawmakers walked off their jobs to protest the disputed results of last year's parliamentary elections in Kabul, effectively paralyzing the fractured National Assembly by denying it a quorum. Still seething at President Hamid Karzai and with no resolution to the deeper grievances crippling Afghanistan's government, the dissident members nevertheless ended their boycott and marched back into the assembly.

POSSIBLE TAMPERING PROMPTS
A RECALL VOTE IN ARIZONA
At first glance, it had the makings of a spirited election: the leader of Arizona's crackdown on illegal immigration facing off at the polls with an immigrant from Mexico who believed that the state had gone too far. But the immigrant, Olivia Cortes, a retiree who filed papers to challenge the State Senate president, Russell Pearce, vanished from the political scene just as quickly as she had appeared. Page 12
MOVING ATLANTA CYCLORAMA
The Atlanta Cyclorama has been thrilling audiences in its present location since 1921. The heart of the exhibit is a circular, 125-year-old oil painting on five panels of Belgian linen that depicts one of the great battles of the Civil War. There is talk of moving it elsewhere in the city. A new location might give the cyclorama more pop, but messing with it is not a popular idea. Page 12
G.O.P.'S EDUCATION GOALS
For a generation, there has been loose bipartisan agreement in Washington that the federal government has a necessary role to play in the nation's 15,000 school districts, primarily by using money to compel states to raise standards. But the field of Republican presidential candidates argue that education responsibilities should devolve to states and local districts. Page 20

LOST PRARIE COMPANION
After an absence of 15 years, the Jets and the N.H.L. have returned to Winnipeg, Manitoba. Which is a good thing because the emotions sweeping the citizens of that prairie city at their beloved club's rebirth have grown to a pitch so fevered that they are practically uncontainable. The residents of Winnipeg are as ecstatic now as they were heartbroken in 1996, when, despite a two-year Save the Jets campaign, their N.H.L. team moved to Phoenix. Page 1
THE POINT OF THE EXTRA POINT
The first four weeks of the N.F.L. season have been filled with surprises, but there has been one constant: the extra point. For the better part of a decade, the accuracy rate for extra points has hovered around 99 percent, making the kick itself seem equal parts automatic and superfluous, Dave Seminara writes. All that precision raises the question: what is the point of the extra point? Page 2
POSSIBLE CURE FOR THE JETS
Any hope the Jets have of toppling New England rests with their ability to disrupt and harass quarterback Tom Brady as they did during their playoff victory in January, writes Ben Shpigel. But the Jets cannot win unless they score more points, a reality that this week in particular seems at once a monumental undertaking and a not-totally-unreasonable possibility. Page 2

Full text: IF you bought a precious-metals fund at the start of this year because you expected stock market turbulence and thought gold would be a refuge, your foresight was impressive. Your returns? Not as much.
Gold rose 14.3 percent, to $1,624 an ounce, in the first nine months of the year, including 8.2 percent in the third quarter. The price has been underpinned by persistent doubts about the economic and financial health of the United States and Europe and the measures that governments and central banks might have to take to put things right.
Those concerns also sent stocks cascading around the world. These included stock in gold companies, despite the soaring price of their main product. The XAU, a widely followed index of gold and silver mining stocks, ended September with a loss of 18.4 percent for 2011, a far worse performance than metallic gold and even worse than the 10 percent loss for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.
Some of the performance discrepancy between gold and mining stocks is justified by developments affecting the metal and the companies that produce it, analysts and fund managers say. Nevertheless, they expect the gap to narrow, although they disagree on whether gold will fall or mining stocks will rise -- or whether there will be some of both.
"When you buy any commodity equity, it's not the same as buying the commodity," Rebecca Patterson, chief market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, said to explain the divergence. "You're going to have some correlation with the broader stock market. During the last couple of months, rather than hope for growth and a need for an inflation hedge, we have fear of a double dip. The stock portion of gold stocks is getting pulled down sharply. That doesn't mean it's a bad investment, just a different investment."
Investors may buy mining stocks to get gold, but they also get businesses whose bottom lines are influenced by more than the price of what they sell.
"When you buy a company, you're getting access to other risks," said Nathan J. Rowader, manager of the Forward Commodity Long/Short Strategy fund. "Investors are not valuing miners as highly as physical gold because of some of those risks."
One risk he mentioned is geopolitical: much gold happens to be located in dangerous, unstable places.
There have also been unwelcome developments on the other side of corporate earnings statements. Ms. Patterson pointed out that mine operators have been facing rising expenses of all sorts.
"Power costs are rising. Labor costs are rising," she said. "They're trying to increase production, but that means deeper mines and more costly mines to operate."
Another reason for the comparatively weak showing of mining stocks, in her view, is the emergence of other vehicles for betting on gold, including exchange-traded funds that hold the physical metal. In the old days, investors who wanted to possess gold might buy coins or bars and lock them in a safe-deposit box.
Joung Park, a gold stock analyst at Morningstar, highlighted another shortcoming of mining companies that may have held back their stocks: gold in the ground is not the same as cash on the books.
"Obviously, a lot of the value for these miners is not created now, at current valuations," but later on, when gold prices may be lower, he said. "Some investors don't think gold prices will stay at current levels forever." Mr. Park said he expected the metal to average $1,200 an ounce over the long haul.
He noted that many factors beyond widespread fear were supporting gold and could begin working to the advantage of mining companies. Interest rates are very low worldwide, which makes bonds and similar assets relatively less appealing alternatives. Consumers in emerging economies, often a source of robust demand for gold, are thriving. And energy costs have begun to moderate.
If these trends continued, "we would see some of the underperformance reverse" for mining stocks, Mr. Park predicted, and they would "play catch-up."
Not that he is expecting much of a boom. His favorite mining company is Yamana Gold, a Canadian company that he expects to show significant growth as new mines start to produce. Otherwise, he said, "we think most of the miners that we cover are fairly valued."
JOHN HATHAWAY, manager of the Tocqueville Gold fund, has much higher hopes for the sector. He sees the failure of mining stocks to keep pace with the metal as another opportunity to hop on the bandwagon -- one that he expects to keep rolling along.
"I don't agree with the cost argument because margins are the largest they've been in history," he said. Another factor in the lagging returns of mining stocks, he said, "is fear that the gold price will come back substantially, but gold is different from all other commodities." He added: "There's no substitute for gold when you have a monetary crisis. When oil goes up, it's because of a shortage or other macro factors, but when gold goes up, it's because people don't trust paper currency. What's going to make people start trusting paper currency?"
Mr. Hathaway says that gold stocks are appealing based on the same criteria that investors use to judge stocks in most industries, and that he thinks others will come around to his view. "The generalist investor who has been burned in bank or retailing stocks, whatever, is going to look at this and think that these stocks trade at low multiples of earnings and cash flow and have high dividends compared with other stuff," he predicted.
He prefers companies with mines in politically stable countries or at least whose mines are well diversified geographically, including two Canadian producers, Goldcorp and Osisko, as well as Newmont Mining, based in Colorado.
The weakness in mining stocks may be offering investors "a do-over," Mr. Hathaway said. "If you missed the 50 percent rise in gold, you've got a second chance."
Ms. Patterson, at J.P. Morgan, doesn't disagree, but she sees too many uncertainties for investors to bet too much on one gold play over the other.
"We want diversification, and I don't see that changing in the near future," she said. "You want to own some commodities and some equities. If I were putting my own money to work right now, I would own both."

Abstract: There has also been the continuing failure of European politicians to come up with a workable solution to Greece's debt problem and, in August, Standard & Poor's downgrade of the United States credit rating. Bill Stone, the chief investment strategist at PNC Wealth Management, has championed dividend-paying stocks all year and continues to do so.

Full text: IN January, I set out to write quarterly columns that would check in with the same group of market prognosticators. I wanted to see how accurate their forecasts would be and what they would say when they were wrong.
But I'll give them this: in terms of macroeconomic events, this has not been an easy year to predict, starting with the earthquake in Japan and the revolutions in the Middle East. There has also been the continuing failure of European politicians to come up with a workable solution to Greece's debt problem and, in August, Standard & Poor's downgrade of the United States credit rating.
Perhaps not surprisingly, the group this time around was unwilling to venture a guess on that staple of all market predictions: where the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index will end the year. The best I could muster from anyone was "higher" than it is now.
The group has been consistently off the mark on economic growth, lowering their expectations each quarter. Predictions of 3 to 4 percent growth in January have given way to predictions this time of half that, or less.
So given the year so far, it is remarkable that many of this group's predictions have held true, for good and bad. Here is an assessment of the group's calls to date and some tepid predictions on what the last quarter will bring.
GOOD CALLS The good calls have been the conservative ones.
Bill Stone, the chief investment strategist at PNC Wealth Management, has championed dividend-paying stocks all year and continues to do so. What has changed is his reason for recommending them.
At the beginning of the year, Mr. Stone said he backed these stocks because he believed that money would move from bonds into stocks and that dividend-paying ones would benefit first. As other people turned against stocks over the summer, he said that companies paying a dividend had the cash reserves to continue to pay or increase them -- evidence that they were well run.
Now, like other strategists, Mr. Stone sees dividend-paying stocks as unique survivors and one of the few securities that offer income. The average dividend yield on the S.&.P 500, 2.22 percent, is now higher than the 2.08 percent yield on 10-year Treasuries for the first time since the 1950s.
"We're sticking with the call, but when it won't work is when we get a strong snapback," Mr. Stone said. "When the market decides it's not so concerned about the double-dip recession, it will drive the other stocks higher more quickly."
The other stock picker who has stuck to his recommendations with good results is Niall J. Gannon, director of wealth management at the Gannon Group at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney. His big call at the beginning of the year was on stocks of companies that derived a substantial proportion of their revenue from outside the United States. One of his favorites is Nike, which is up 3.78 percent this year.
He said these were the only companies that were insulated from country-specific economic shocks. People may be buying fewer bottles of Coca-Cola in Greece, but they may be buying more in Brazil.
Of course, being right is not always something to gloat about. Richard Madigan, chief investment officer for J. P. Morgan's Global Access Portfolios, has been right about something he wishes he had gotten wrong: unemployment in the United States. He predicted it would stay between 9 and 10 percent all year. While he was briefly wrong when the unemployment rate dipped to 8.9 percent in March, he is right again, and he does not like the implications of being correct.
"For markets, it's going to be a much more aggressive campaign cycle into next year," he said. "The political rhetoric will distract markets. It'll be noise with a lot of policy uncertainty."
With this bleak outlook, he is encouraging clients to stop thinking in calendar years. Trying to make up for the losses of the last two months could land people in worse straits.
CHANGED CALLS If there was one area that did not turn out as this group imagined, it was debt.
Richard Cookson, chief investment officer at Citi Private Bank, was the most brutally honest member of the group. A week before our call, he issued a report to the firm's clients conceding that he had gotten one of his calls on long-duration bonds wrong. He titled it "Gross Miscalculation."
Now, instead of those government bonds, he is recommending investors shift to long-dated corporate bonds.
"Corporate balance sheets are very strong right now," Mr. Cookson said. "The reason long-dated investment grade has done so well is because of a fall in government bond yields. They've risen to the sort of level where they're more attractive than long-dated government bonds."
He said he still believed that inflation was not a threat, which meant that yields on government bonds would stay low for the foreseeable future.
Mr. Madigan and Marc D. Stern, chief investment officer at Bessemer Trust, both predicted in January that yields on Treasury bonds would rise this year, as people invested in other assets. But the opposite has happened.
"We've gotten the bond market wrong," Mr. Stern said. "The five-year Treasury was at 2 percent at the beginning of the year. We thought it would go to 4 percent and you'd lock in your losses. It went to 1 percent, and it could go to 0.5 percent."
Yet he warned that when the economy improves, bond yields will rise quickly. "You're playing with fire," he said.
This is another call where it would have been better if Mr. Stern had been right. The persistently low yields on Treasuries are not a reflection of investors' love of American assets but of their fear of everything else.
Municipal bonds have been a bright spot if only because there have not been the big defaults that the market analyst Meredith Whitney predicted at the beginning of the year. Mr. Gannon was particularly pleased by this. He recommended a 40 percent allocation to municipal bonds in the portfolios of his wealthiest clients. That allocation has returned 9 percent so far this year. While he attributes this to a bond bubble, he said he was happy that his clients could benefit from it.
FINAL QUARTER The most troubling development may be that markets will remain volatile. While the group was hesitant to say how the year would end, they shared a common frustration -- that policy makers in the United States and Europe were hurting their economies.
Politicians in the United States, they all said, are stuck in ideological positions over spending, debt and taxes and not focused on finding a way to stimulate the economy and create jobs. "The very difficult debate surrounding the debt ceiling was destructive of confidence," Mr. Stern said. "When you already have weak confidence, that's bound to worsen it. And it did."
Their European counterparts are just as bad, delaying a decision on what to do with Greece -- and by extension, other shaky countries in the European Union. "Greece will default in the next few weeks," Mr. Cookson said. "It's going to mean something of a banking crisis. How do you ring-fence Greece and not Ireland and Portugal?"
Mr. Madigan said this summer that European politicians would continue to "kick the can down the road." That is what they have done. The result has been what he termed "staggering volatility."
"If you were to look at long-term U.S. Treasury price volatility, it's running along with equity volatility along with gold and Swiss franc volatility," he said. "It's difficult to focus on fundamentals when volatility and correlation are dictating the range."
Or as Mr. Gannon put it: "You have to recognize that volatility is here to stay. Prices are being set by minute-by-minute trading, so we cannot look to daily market moves to validate our opinions or thesis as an investor."
The only certainty, then, is that the fourth quarter will be interesting.

Abstract: Greece would be in much better shape now if it had never joined the euro zone, or if it had been kicked out in 2004 when it admitted that it had lied about its finances to join the club. If Greece were to follow the example set by Argentina nearly a decade ago, it would simply convert its debts from euros into its old currency, the drachma, at the old exchange rate of 340.75 drachmas to one euro.

Full text: Greece would be in much better shape now if it had never joined the euro zone, or if it had been kicked out in 2004 when it admitted that it had lied about its finances to join the club. So would the rest of Europe.
So why not get out now?
One answer is the same one that was given when Greece's cheating was revealed: Legally, there is no way out. The euro was designed to be the Roach Motel of currencies. Once you enter, you can never leave. There is no provision for departure.
But, of course, there is a way out. It would be messy, and perhaps disastrous. But no one is going to send an army to Athens to force it to keep the euro.
If Greece were to follow the example set by Argentina nearly a decade ago, it would simply convert its debts from euros into its old currency, the drachma, at the old exchange rate of 340.75 drachmas to one euro. It could also convert euro currency in the country at the same rate. So if you owned one million euros in Greek bonds, they would be converted to bonds with a face value of 340.75 million drachmas.
With a printing press available, Greece could meet those obligations. Of course the drachma would soon be worth a lot less -- perhaps 1,000 to the euro. So bondholders would have lost two-thirds of face value. Greece might do O.K., but for reasons we will see, the move could be devastating to the rest of Europe.
In 2002, Argentina's currency, the peso, was officially tied to the dollar at a one-to-one parity. There was a "currency board" that was supposed to assure the tie could never be broken, and it had worked for a decade. But Argentine inflation had outpaced that of the United States, and the peso was seriously overvalued.
In early 2002, a new Argentine government ended the peg and did much more. It defaulted, and it required its citizens to do the same. If you had a dollar deposit in an Argentine bank, it became a peso deposit, soon to be worth about 30 United States cents to the peso. That was true regardless of who owned the bank. If you wanted to get dollars back from your Citibank deposit in Buenos Aires, you were out of luck.
Argentina was cut off from international credit. Imports plunged and the country entered a deep -- but relatively brief -- recession. The peso lost two-thirds of its value within a few months. Argentina was sued by everyone in sight.
But devaluation worked, as it often does. Argentine exports became competitive thanks to lower costs, and the economy rebounded. There are international judgments still outstanding against the country, but when it comes to sovereign states it can be easier to get judgments than to collect on them. Diplomatic assets are off limits -- no one can grab the Argentine Embassy in Washington -- and monetary assets can be kept with the Bank for International Settlements in Switzerland, which will not allow them to be seized.
Argentina's decision to abrogate private contracts was a crucial part of the package, said John Hempton, an Australian hedge fund manager who has studied what happened. "The Argentine banks all had lots of U.S. dollar funding," he said. If they had to repay those dollars, while their assets were devalued, "then they would all have uncontrolled defaults, a true disaster, and the country would lose its institutions."
The Argentine experience was not pretty, but it may well be more attractive than the seemingly endless rounds of austerity, strikes and missed fiscal targets that seem to be leaving the Greek economy in a permanent recession. From the Greek perspective, the course could seem attractive.
There are some important differences, of course. Argentina had a currency that still existed, and there were peso notes. There are no drachma notes floating around Athens or anywhere else. If the drachma suddenly became the legal currency again, currency would be needed. Printing new notes in secret would be a challenge.
Would the bond switch be legal? For some bonds, clearly it would not be. British courts "would enter judgments saying Greece owes x billion euros," said Whitney Debevoise, a lawyer with Arnold & Porter, "but would then have to find assets."
But British courts would have jurisdiction only over the minority of bonds issued under British law. Most Greek bonds were issued under Greek law, and presumably Greece can change that law to legalize what it does. Greek bonds already trade for less than 40 percent of face value, so it is possible that their actual value might not decline all that much, assuming investors believed the drachmas would be repaid.
Greece would suddenly be forced to run a balanced budget, or to borrow from its own citizens, whose savings would have lost much, if not most, of their value.
For Greece to pull that off, it would probably have to do it over a weekend, without leaks of what it was planning. If people got wind of what might be coming, there would be an immediate run on Greek banks.
When Argentina did it, there was no immediate ripple effect. But in Europe the result would very likely be explosive. There would be a run on banks in peripheral countries. If Greece can do it, what about Portugal, or Spain, or Italy?
Mr. Hempton has a vision of what rational people in the peripheral countries would do as soon as they heard about the Greek move. "Max all your credit cards for cash, draw all your bank deposits" and drive to somewhere safe. Money would pour into banks in Germany.
Or maybe not. German banks would have a lot of assets that were suddenly worth less, particularly if other countries did follow Greece. Owing euros to depositors, and getting devalued drachmas, or lire, or escudos, or pesetas from borrowers is one way to make capital vanish.
None of this is made any easier by the fact that in the old days to have a run on a bank you needed to show up at an office during banking hours. When the Austro-Hungarian empire collapsed after World War I, countries stamped the old currency to convert it into their currencies and stopped people at borders to search for cash. Now we live in a world of wired money. Most money is not in bills or coins but in bank deposits that can be moved halfway around the world nearly instantly. Border guards might not be much help.
In other words, Greece would fare poorly if it tried the Argentine strategy, but would have hope for recovery. But it might be impossible to halt the crisis for the rest of Europe.
Which brings us back to what is going on now.
European leaders hold meetings -- this week in Luxembourg, next month in Cannes -- at which they say they are determined to deal with the problem but seem to be unable to do much. The July 21 agreement for a new bailout of Greece is nearing ratification by all the euro area governments but seems woefully out of date. Greece's fiscal situation is growing worse, so it cannot meet its deficit targets. Some politicians want banks to take bigger losses than the July deal envisaged, but bank regulators are afraid of what would happen as a result. Greece remains woefully uncompetitive in export markets, and there is no credible plan to get its economy growing. The rest of Europe uses the threat of cutting off funds to force more and more austerity on the Greek government.
Many Greek citizens are acting as if there really is no need for all that austerity. There was a one-day general strike on Wednesday, with 20,000 marchers reported on the streets of Athens. The tax collectors, of all people, have staged job actions because they fear being laid off. To say the least, there is no sign of a national spirit of sacrifice to save the country.
The message from Greece now may be summarized as, "I'm small. I've suffered. You can afford to rescue me. If you don't, I can create chaos for all of you."
They may be right.

Abstract: The Syrian government on Tuesday revoked a recent decision to ban imports of most consumer goods, a move that had sent prices soaring and provoked outrage among a business elite that has until now backed the leadership of President Bashar al-Assad in his nearly seven-month contest with anti-government activists. Analysts said that the ban imposed last week on imported merchandise, which included cars, household appliances and even food items, underscored a deep sense of anxiety among the authorities as Syria faces some of its most dangerous political unrest in four decades of dictatorship.

Full text: BEIRUT, Lebanon -- The Syrian government on Tuesday revoked a recent decision to ban imports of most consumer goods, a move that had sent prices soaring and provoked outrage among a business elite that has until now backed the leadership of President Bashar al-Assad in his nearly seven-month contest with anti-government activists.
The revocation was just one in a string of developments on a tumultuous day for Syria. The United Nations Security Council voted Tuesday on a resolution calling for an end to violence there and suggesting the possibility of sanctions; the resolution failed after Russia and China vetoed it.
Meanwhile, Turkey said it would begin military maneuvers along its border with Syria this week. Though previously announced, the location of the exercise near the border seemed a move by an increasingly assertive Turkey to bring more pressure on Damascus.
"Now they're really banging the gavel," an Obama administration official said of the Turkish announcement. "They're suddenly moving very fast."
Analysts said that the ban imposed last week on imported merchandise, which included cars, household appliances and even food items, underscored a deep sense of anxiety among the authorities as Syria faces some of its most dangerous political unrest in four decades of dictatorship. Officials said it was needed to protect foreign currency reserves.
Analysts said the ban had been ordered without any study of the potential effects on the Syrian market or on Syria's trade agreements with neighboring countries. Some economists in Syria said the import ban and its reversal were indicators that the Syrian leadership remained uncertain in the face of the uprising and its ramifications for the Syrian economy.
"The ruling caused a domestic uproar that was very important," said Nabil Sukkar, a former senior economist at the World Bank who now leads the Syrian Consulting Bureau for Development and Investment, based in Damascus. "They realized that they can't do that because it will lead to soaring prices, smuggling, unemployment and harm the credibility of the reforms."
The United States and the European Union have imposed strict economic sanctions on Syria, including an embargo on its crude oil, over its brutal crackdown on pro-democracy protests, in which 2,700 people have been killed, according to the United Nations.
The uprising, which started in mid-March, has devastated Syria's economy. The International Monetary Fund predicted that growth might shrink by 2 percent this year, given a decline in investment and losses in tourism which, with oil, provide Syria with much of its foreign currency.
"There is no work, no customers," said a salesman at an art gallery in Bab Touma, a Christian neighborhood in Damascus. "It has been a really bad season."
Analysts said the Syrian government would now take other steps to protect its foreign reserves, which Finance Minister Mohammad al-Jleilati recently estimated at $18 billion -- enough to cover the country's imports for two years. Some economists dismissed that figure as inflated.
It was not immediately clear why Syria would impose such a ban if it had two years' worth of reserves on hand. The measure was announced by the economy minister, Mohammad Nidal al-Shaar, on Sept. 26. He said that it was temporary and precautionary, but that it was necessary to protect foreign currency reserves, a main indicator of the government's stability.
The Obama administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity following diplomatic protocol, contended that despite the reversal, "the damage has already been done." The official said inflation had tripled and smuggling had surged since the decision was made, unsettling the business elite in Syria, which has largely sided with the government.
The "well-to-do are completely dismayed with Assad," the American official said. "They don't think he knows what he's doing. Inflation has gone up. He can't fix it."
Turkey remains a wild card in the developments in Syria. Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, once one of Mr. Assad's closest allies, has said he will no longer communicate with the Syrian president, after Mr. Assad repeatedly misled Mr. Erdogan and other Turkish officials about his intentions. Turkish officials have said they will impose sanctions soon, possibly by this week, potentially deepening Syria's economic woes. Particularly in Aleppo, near the Turkish border, Turkey has fostered economic ties.
At the Security Council, nine nations, including the United States and its Western allies, voted for the measure condemning Syria, while Brazil, India, South Africa and Lebanon abstained. Russia, whose main ally in the Middle East is Syria, had said that it would not accept a resolution that included even a hint of sanctions.
The American ambassador, Susan E. Rice, accused opponents of the resolution of seeking to continue arms sales to Syria. "During this season of change, the people of the Middle East can now see clearly which nations have chosen to ignore their calls for democracy and instead prop up desperate, cruel dictators," Ms. Rice said.

Full text: China is undeniably manipulating its currency. Countries around the world, including the United States, are losing jobs because their manufacturing industries cannot compete with artificially cheap Chinese goods. For the good of the world economy, and its own long-term economic development, China should stop.
Still, a Senate bill, with strong bipartisan support, to punish countries that manipulate their currencies is a bad idea. It could do even more damage to the American economy if -- as is all too likely -- China decides to retaliate.
Senator Charles Schumer, a Democrat of New York, declared that the legislation "is a clear, unwavering message from both parties to China's leaders -- the jig is up; it's time to stop gaming the system or face severe consequences." Talk of payback is playing well with his colleagues. On Monday, 79 senators -- 47 Democrats, 31 Republicans and 1 independent -- voted to initiate debate.
Growing trade with China over the past two decades has been one of the leading causes of the decline of manufacturing employment. The United States would likely add jobs over time if the renminbi was allowed to rise more significantly. Some high-technology industries, like the nascent American solar-panel business, would be a lot more competitive against their Chinese rivals. But many of the low-wage businesses lost to Chinese competition -- like toys and textiles -- will never come back.
Stiff retaliatory tariffs or other punishments are also very unlikely to persuade Beijing to swiftly abandon a policy that has been at the core of its economic strategy for two decades. Instead, it could add an explosive new conflict to an already heavy list of bilateral frictions.
The Senate bill is intended to limit the executive branch's discretion. It would require the Treasury Department to identify countries whose currencies were grossly misaligned -- with China everyone's favorite culprit. If Beijing persisted, Washington would be required -- with a delimited presidential waiver -- to stop spending federal dollars on Chinese goods, and consider the renminbi's undervaluation in antidumping cases against Chinese imports. The Treasury Department would also be required to ask the Federal Reserve to consider acting in currency markets to counteract the undervaluation of China's currency. And the bill would increase the pressure on the Commerce Department to impose tariffs on undervalued Chinese products.
Given Beijing's history of meeting fire with fire, many experts fear that China would retaliate on other fronts, like dragging its feet on customs inspections of American imports, opening new antidumping investigations against American goods or slowing its promised efforts to halt the stealing of American intellectual property. Beijing might even slow the renminbi's current rise against the dollar, which translates into an appreciation rate of some 10 percent per year, after taking Chinese inflation into account.
The Obama administration has been pressing Beijing on the broad range of economic relations. It has won some important cases at the World Trade Organization. But it could do more to challenge other illegal policies, like China's ban on the export of rare earth materials used in high-tech industries.
It could more explicitly link China's bid for a bilateral investment agreement with the United States and a designation as a "market economy" at the W.T.O. to improvements in Chinese policies. It should press the European Union, Brazil and others to increase the rhetorical heat. China's undervalued currency hurts them, too.
Beijing is not immune to pressure. But the Senate bill is too blunt an instrument.

Full text: Good ends do not justify bad means. That philosophical observation applies to proposals for a big American debt jubilee that are now doing the rounds. The basic idea is to slash consumer debt, which is an admirable aim for an overleveraged nation. Household debt is still 90 percent of gross domestic product, down only modestly from the 2008 peak of 100 percent. But even bank-haters should recognize that this cure might be worse than the disease.
To start, writing off debts would not necessarily increase economic growth. Every liability is also an asset, so while a dollar that is no longer required for debt repayment might add some cents to consumer spending, it is also a dollar cut out of a bank's capital or of an investor's net worth -- subtracting from resources and confidence.
And write-offs big enough to change consumer behavior would probably be big enough to destabilize banks. The Federal Reserve or the government would need to help, presumably by injecting newly printed money as capital. Such government control is usually inefficient, and abundant printing of money increases the risk of uncontrolled inflation, which has its own way of making people feel poorer.
The issue of moral hazard also cannot be ignored. Much of the excess debt was incurred through irresponsible mortgage refinancing, which peaked in 2006 at $322 billion, representing 2.4 percent of G.D.P. The reckless use of houses as A.T.M.'s was a major factor in decapitalizing and destabilizing the American economy. Forgiving such debts will teach the wrong lesson: borrow in haste, repent never.
Finally, investors would rightly see a jubilee as an attack on property rights. That runs the risk of throwing markets into disarray and discouraging foreign investors from buying assets in the United States. Risk premiums on both debt and equity capital would increase.
There are better ways to deleverage. Higher inflation does the job more naturally, without invidious choices about whose debt got reduced. But inflation also discourages savers, weakening capital formation. The best way to get debts under control is the hard slog of paying some back and writing the rest off.
Sound money, including interest rates above inflation, would help by preserving existing capital and promoting savings. After all, capital creation, not its destruction through debt forgiveness, is what makes capitalism work.
Apple's New Victims
Apple has an astonishing ability to casually unleash creative destruction. Its latest iPhone, the 4S, offers faster data processing and downloads as well as voice-powered software. The phone, released Tuesday, may not have lived up to the most feverish expectations of investors. Apple shares fell while the market rallied. But it will do more than enough to create headaches for companies ranging from Research in Motion to American Greetings.
Smartphones started by devouring the personal digital assistant, as any former Palm Pilot aficionado can testify. Wristwatch sales declined. They terrorized the market for fixed-line phones, which are now in sharp decline. Apple's newest gadget shows just how hungry smartphone makers, and Apple in particular, are to eat the lunches of all sorts of rivals.
For instance, the new iPhone offers an improved video camera. That will further hurt sales of digital still and video cameras. Its software allows easy and free texting to other Apple devices. That's bad news for telephone operators, who make fat margins on such services. Instant messaging has also been the killer app for BlackBerry users.
Apple also unveiled a function that lets users digitally create their own greeting cards and send them in physical form. That may not excite Apple's most ardent fans, but it was enough to send shares of the card makers American Greetings and the British company International Greetings reeling. Oh, and the new iPod Nano allows runners to track their performance, which will take a chunk out of the market for personal fitness monitors and shoes with sensors.
In a sense, though, these are the easily quantifiable effects of the new iPhone. The device also comes with software allowing users to search the Internet, answer queries, take dictation or set up phone commands using their voice. It's hard to judge how effective this software is until the 4S hits the shelves. But investors on the lookout for Apple's creative/destructive impact should be drawing up a new list of victims.

Full text: PARIS -- The European debt problems that have roiled global financial markets for the last 18 months are showing signs of turning into a far deeper challenge: Europe's second recession in three years.
Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain are already in downturns or fighting to avoid them, as high unemployment and austerity belt-tightening take their toll. But in the last few weeks, even prosperous Germany and France, the Continent's powerhouses, have started to be dragged down, hurt by the ebbing of business orders from indebted countries in the rest of Europe.
European stocks continued their latest plunge on Tuesday, as the German financial giant Deutsche Bank, buffeted by the debt crisis, reduced its profit forecast for the year. Investors were also jolted by news that the French-Belgian investment bank Dexia might be the region's first large bank to need a government rescue as a result of the current debt crisis.
It is not just the Continent's problem.
The United States, a major banking and trading partner with Europe, is stuck in its own rut -- prompting the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, to warn Tuesday that "the recovery is close to faltering." He told a Congressional panel that the economy could fall into a new recession unless the government took further action.
United States stocks ended up for the day, but had bounced wildly on jitters about Europe and rising fears that Greece would have to default on its sovereign -- or government -- debt. The Greek finance minister said Tuesday that the country could continue to pay its bills at least through mid-November, after other European finance ministers said Greece would not receive its next installment of bailout money before next month, if then.
A downturn in Europe, if it happens, could help tip America back into recession and would undoubtedly ricochet around the world. Europe's banks are among the most interconnected in the world, and the euro is the world's second-largest reserve currency after the dollar.
The 17 European Union nations that share the euro together account for about one-fifth of global output. And emerging markets that are important customers for European exports, like China and Brazil, are beginning to retrench.
"We are the epicenter of this global crisis," Jean-Claude Trichet, the president of the European Central Bank, said on Tuesday at the European Parliament.
A growing chorus of analysts now predict that Europe is heading for an outright recession. "The sovereign debt crisis is like a fungus on the economy," said Jorg Kramer, the chief economist at Commerzbank. "I thought it would be just a slowdown," he said. "But I have changed my mind."
Goldman Sachs predicted Tuesday that both Germany and France would slip into recession, although other forecasts are less grim.
Already, the euro zone economy has slowed to essentially zero growth. It could stay in a slump, many economists say, at least through next spring. If that happens, tax revenue is likely to fall and unemployment, already high, is expected to rise, making it even more difficult for Europe to address the sovereign debt crisis and protect its shaky banks.
In a sign of how quickly the ground is shifting, the European Central Bank might lower interest rates on Thursday -- just a few months after it started raising them in what is now seen as a misguided effort to stem incipient inflation.
Distress is increasingly evident across Europe.
Philippe Leydier, a French businessman, had been feeling more upbeat until this summer, when orders for his company's corrugated boxes suddenly began to slide. Orders fell further last month, as auto parts makers, electrical engineering firms, farmers and other industries reduced production.
"The euro crisis and the financial crisis linked to the debt of European countries is serious," said Mr. Leydier, whose box and paper manufacturing firm, Emin Leydier, in Lyon, often provides an early signal of seismic shifts in economic activity. "European governments need to find a solution -- and fast."
In Italy, which has the euro zone's third-largest economy, after those of Germany and France, a 45 billion euro austerity program aimed at reducing debt has many worried about a recession. On Tuesday, the ratings agency Moody's downgraded Italian government bonds by three notches, to A2 from Aa2, and kept a negative outlook on the rating.
Paolo Bastianello, the managing director of Marly's, an Italian clothing retailer, is increasingly discouraged.
At the start of the year, Mr. Bastianello was more optimistic that Europe would escape its troubles and that the government might seriously tackle Italy's problems. "But the turbulence of the markets and the uncertainty about this abnormal mass of public debt just scare people away from buying," he said.
Not everyone is so pessimistic. Some German executives say sales remain healthy, at least so far. "We don't see any impact on our business," said Roland Busch, a member of the management board of Siemens, the electronics and engineering giant based in Munich.
"The economy is cooling down but not more than that," said Mr. Busch, who oversees a unit that supplies traffic control systems, streetcars and other products for public works.
Expecting demand for urban infrastructure improvements to grow, Siemens plans to add about 150 people over the next two years to its 850 employees at its complex in Sacramento that makes light-rail cars.
Bucking the trend almost everywhere else in the developed world, unemployment in Germany continues to fall, and there are shortages of skilled workers in several important sectors.
Jens Weidmann, who runs Germany's central bank and serves on the executive board of the European Central Bank, predicted last week that the nation would hit "a soft patch" but escape recession.
Commerzbank predicts German growth will slow almost to zero in the fourth quarter of 2011, but not decline. At best, though, it expects Germany to grow by no more than 1 percent in 2012.
The International Monetary Fund is a little more optimistic, predicting growth of 1.3 percent next year in Germany after a healthy 2.7 percent this year.
But the I.M.F. recently acknowledged that it, too, had overestimated the rate of Europe's recovery. It now forecasts that growth in the euro zone will slide to 1.1 percent in 2012, after a 1.6 percent gain this year. In Spain, where tens of thousands of protestors have called for the government to ease its austerity plan, the I.M.F. expects growth to pick up to 1.1 percent next year from 0.8 percent this year.
Still, unemployment in Spain remains at 20 percent, and youth joblessness is nearly twice that rate. Pfizer, the American pharmaceutical giant, said last week it would cut 220 Spanish jobs.
The economy is worse in Portugal, which is operating under a bailout agreement with the European Union and the I.M.F. The I.M.F. warned the new prime minister, Pedro Passos Coelho, that Lisbon still needed to find an additional 1 billion euros in budget savings. But further austerity may only deepen the downturn, with Portugal's economy expected to fall by 1.8 percent this year and 2.3 percent in 2012.
Joao Figueiredo, the owner of a small ship repair yard in Lisbon, expects his first annual loss since 2002. "There are now many clients who are late in their payments and whose money I will probably never see," he said.
The worldwide dimension of the financial crisis, Mr. Figueiredo added, made the outcome even more uncertain. "We're now in the middle of a crisis that started in American real estate and then crossed over to Europe, and it seems really nobody has any idea where this will go next and for how long."
Portugal's slump convinced Francois Libner, the president of Libner S.A., a French manufacturer of delivery truck bodies, that it was hopeless to keep trying to sell there.
After growth in Portugal, Greece, Spain, and Italy started to trail off last year, he shifted his focus to Germany. Mr. Libner figures it will take at least a decade for any real growth to return to Southern Europe, particularly in Spain and Greece, which he classifies as "a catastrophe."
Mr. Libner said he hoped Paris's efforts to bring the country's deficit and overall debt into line with European rules would allow France to keep its AAA bond rating -- provided that European leaders figure out how to contain the debt crisis to Greece. If that happens, he said, Europe could rebound quickly, as investors regain faith in the viability of the euro union.
But if it does not happen, and Europe's banks become further ensnared in the crisis -- he shuddered at the thought. "We can pay for Greece, but not for all of Europe," he said. If the crisis swells, he added, "we won't have the means to pay for all of this."

Full text: Annual premiums for employer-sponsored health coverage soared by 9 percent for families and 8 percent for individuals this year from 2010, far faster than wages or inflation. Republicans, predictably, blamed health care reform for contributing to the rise. In fact, the reforms accounted for only 1.5 percentage points of the increase this year. The value to millions of Americans who are already getting expanded coverage and benefits is undeniable.
So what is driving up insurance premiums? The main factors, analysts say, were increased medical care costs and higher profits for insurance companies, which charged a lot more in premiums than they paid out for medical services. Both problems are being addressed by the health care reforms. But, clearly, they will require even more vigorous attention.
This latest survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Health Research and Educational Trust found that the average total family premium climbed above $15,000 in 2011, with the worker paying roughly $4,100 and the employer about $10,900. Since the survey started in 1999, worker contributions to premiums have increased 168 percent, while wages have gone up 50 percent.
The two reforms that affected premiums -- together making up about one-sixth of the 9 percent premium increase for a family plan -- required that parents be allowed to keep children up to age 26 on their policies and that many insurance plans cover preventive services like cancer screening and immunizations at no cost to patients. Some 2.3 million young adults were enrolled on parental policies and 28 million workers (plus their dependents) benefited from preventive care provisions.
The reform law has two provisions that kicked in this year and could help hold down premiums in 2012. Insurers will have to spend at least 80 percent to 85 percent of their premiums on medical care, which will force them to keep the premiums closer to their claim payments. And insurers seeking rate increases of 10 percent or more in the individual and small-group markets must disclose and justify their proposed rates, allowing state regulators an opportunity to reject them or force them down.
The reform law also provides $250 million for grants to help states strengthen their ability to challenge insurers' rate requests. Only about half the states give insurance commissioners power to veto rates deemed excessive; all should allow regulators to reject unfair increases before they happen.
For the longer term, the reform law will create a slew of pilot projects in Medicare to find ways to reduce the cost of delivering care. Any effective strategy should be pushed quickly into the private sector. Until the underlying health care costs are reduced, it will be hard to hold premiums down.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- After his Senate confirmation as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Martin E. Dempsey knew he had some catching up to do before being sworn in last Friday as the nation's highest-ranking officer and the principal military adviser to the president and secretary of defense.
The gap in his training was not the geopolitics of the Middle East, a perpetual source of American security concerns. Even before the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, General Dempsey was among the few senior officers who had spent significant time immersed in Muslim culture, having served for several years as an adviser to Saudi Arabia's security forces. And since 9/11, he has had two tours in Iraq and has been the acting commander of American forces across the Middle East and Central Asia.
He also did not need to study how to hold together a military distressed by the longest period of nonstop war ever sustained by an all-volunteer force. General Dempsey was a chief architect of the blueprints on maintaining and rebuilding the Army when he ran its Training and Doctrine Command before his elevation to Army chief of staff.
Instead, General Dempsey said in an interview, he realized he needed a better understanding of the economy, which seemed likely to define his tenure in the way that counterterrorism, counterinsurgency and combat preoccupied his predecessors over the past decade. During General Dempsey's term, a significant challenge will be how best to care for the military and protect the United States' national security interests with drastically fewer Defense Department dollars.
So he traveled to his alma mater, West Point, entered the social sciences department and asked the professors to educate him about economics.
"I have to confess, I paid no attention to this as a cadet and have done nothing to increase my awareness of economic issues between age 22 and 59," he said. "And here I am, back as the prodigal son, saying, 'I should have paid attention.' The economic factors exist. They will inform my tenure as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. To use the old cliche: that is what it is."
General Dempsey acknowledged an emerging truth about the size of the American military during the coming years: "I do think that we will be smaller," he said. "But there are things we've learned over the last 10 years, capabilities that didn't exist 10 years ago that exist today that can, for example, offset and mitigate the risk of a somewhat smaller conventional or traditional force."
It is up to his two bosses, President Obama and Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta, to decide with Congress how much money can be committed to national security and on the current missions that are no longer affordable.
General Dempsey said his task was "to articulate the risk that we face at certain levels of resourcing," and he pledged to do that without "threat inflation or fear tactics."
General Dempsey has filtered those challenges through his 37 years in uniform. But he articulates them in terms that are not surprising coming from one of the few four-star officers with an advanced degree in humanities, in this case a master's in English from Duke University.
He said he believes that in the second decade after the terrorist attacks of 9/11, the military is confronting "a strategic inflection point, where the institution fundamentally re-examines itself."
It is the third such inflection point in his career.
The first was after the war in Vietnam, when the draft ended, challenging the military to build an all-volunteer force and keep a edge in quality even as it shrank significantly. The second was after the Persian Gulf war of 1991, when the military had to reassess and defend its role in a post-Soviet world, and again shrank significantly.
"And then along comes the threat of Al Qaeda and its associated movements, global networks that threaten us," he said. "And we go through this period in the first decade of the 21st century and become extraordinarily good at counterterrorism, counterinsurgency, stability operations and building partner capacity.
"Now, I think we are at another inflection point, frankly, and what that inflection point will involve is a re-examination of the roles, missions, core competencies of the joint force," he said. "With each inflection point, there is a complication. The complication this time is our economic stature as a nation."
Asked to reflect on the military axiom that "when the money is gone, you have to think smarter," General Dempsey paused and replied, "Inshalla," the Arabic word for "God willing."
He has already made one change to the operations of the military's joint staff, resurrecting the position of senior enlisted adviser to the chairman, which has been vacant since 2008. He gave the post to Sgt. Maj. Bryan Battaglia of the Marine Corps, a veteran of the Iraq war with a Purple Heart, who will focus on the development of enlisted personnel and noncommissioned officers across the military.
General Dempsey grew up in Bayonne, N.J. His father was an oil refinery worker who held a second job as a mail carrier, and his mother stocked shelves at a local department store. He married his high school sweetheart, Deanie, and they have three children, Christopher, Megan and Caitlin. All three have served in the Army.
In lighter moments, General Dempsey has been known to reveal a fine Irish tenor, channeling his inner American songbook on such standards as "New York, New York."
On that topic, he shares an interest with the new secretary of defense, Mr. Panetta, who has kept secret that he is a devoted pianist. Mr. Panetta says he is as proud of his Italian-American roots as General Dempsey is of his Irish-American upbringing.
"He is a soldier's soldier," Mr. Panetta said of the new chairman. "It's nice to have somebody who is a straight shooter because, frankly, the challenges are too damn tough to begin with if you're dealing with somebody who doesn't tell it like it is."
Over dinner with General Dempsey and in other conversations, Mr. Panetta said he gained an important insight.
"He's a big Sinatra fan," Mr. Panetta said. "He likes to belt out favorite Sinatra tunes. I basically told him, though, that, 'I'm sorry, but a guy from an Irish background is not going to be a member of Rat Pack.' "

Holding China To Account

Abstract: In the last few days a new objection to action on the China issue has surfaced: right-wing pressure groups, notably the influential Club for Growth, oppose tariffs on Chinese goods because, you guessed it, they're a form of taxation -- and we must never, ever raise taxes under any circumstances.

Full text: The dire state of the world economy reflects destructive actions on the part of many players. Still, the fact that so many have behaved badly shouldn't stop us from holding individual bad actors to account.
And that's what Senate leaders will be doing this week, as they take up legislation that would threaten sanctions against China and other currency manipulators.
Respectable opinion is aghast. But respectable opinion has been consistently wrong lately, and the currency issue is no exception.
Ask yourself: Why is it so hard to restore full employment? It's true that the housing bubble has popped, and consumers are saving more than they did a few years ago. But once upon a time America was able to achieve full employment without a housing bubble and with savings rates even higher than we have now. What changed?
The answer is that we used to run much smaller trade deficits. A return to economic health would look much more achievable if we weren't spending $500 billion more each year on imported goods and services than foreigners spent on our exports.
To get our trade deficit down, however, we need to make American products more competitive, which in practice means that we need the dollar's value to fall in terms of other currencies. Yes, some people will shriek about "debasing" the dollar. But sensible policy makers have long known that sometimes a weaker currency means a stronger economy, and have acted on that knowledge. Switzerland, for example, has intervened massively to keep the franc from getting too strong against the euro. Israel has intervened even more forcefully to weaken the shekel.
The United States, given its special global role, can't and shouldn't be equally aggressive. But given our economy's desperate need for more jobs, a weaker dollar is very much in our national interest -- and we can and should take action against countries that are keeping their currencies undervalued, and thereby standing in the way of a much-needed decline in our trade deficit.
That, above all, means China. And none of the arguments against holding China accountable can stand serious scrutiny.
Some observers question whether we really know that China's currency is undervalued. But they're kidding, right? The flip side of the manipulation that keeps China's currency undervalued is the accumulation of dollar reserves -- and those reserves now amount to a cool $3.2 trillion.
Others warn of bad consequences if the Chinese stop buying United States bonds. But our problem right now is precisely that too many people want to park their money in American debt instead of buying goods and services -- which is why the interest rate on long-term U.S. bonds is only 2 percent.
Yet another objection is the claim that Chinese products don't really compete with U.S.-produced goods. The rebuttal is fairly technical; let me just say that those making this argument both overstate the case and fail to take the indirect effects of Chinese currency policy into account.
In the last few days a new objection to action on the China issue has surfaced: right-wing pressure groups, notably the influential Club for Growth, oppose tariffs on Chinese goods because, you guessed it, they're a form of taxation -- and we must never, ever raise taxes under any circumstances. All I can say is that Democrats should welcome this demonstration that antitax fanaticism has reached the point where it trumps standing up for our national interests.
To be fair, there are some arguments against action on China that would carry some weight if the times were different. One is the undoubted fact that inflation in China, which is raising labor costs in particular, is gradually eliminating that nation's currency undervaluation. The operative word, however, is "gradually": something that brings the United States trade deficit down over four or five years isn't good enough when unemployment is at disastrous levels right now.
And the reality of the unemployment disaster is also my answer to those who warn that getting tough with China might unleash a trade war or damage world commercial diplomacy. Those are real risks, although I think they're exaggerated. But they need to be set against the fact -- not the mere possibility -- that high unemployment is inflicting tremendous cumulative damage as we speak.
Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, said it clearly last week: unemployment is a "national crisis," with so many workers now among the long-term unemployed that the economy is at risk of suffering long-run as well as short-run damage.
And we can't afford to neglect any important means of alleviating that national crisis. Holding China accountable won't solve our economic problems on its own, but it can contribute to a solution -- and it's an action that's long overdue.

Full text: ON WEDNESDAY, the eyes of the financial world turned to Finland.
Finland?
For all its virtues, that small Nordic country hasn't grabbed much global attention lately. But thanks to the quirky political and economic structure of Europe, last week Finland had the power to send financial markets into a tailspin.
As it turned out, the Finns didn't throw a wrench into the financial gears. But that they were in a position to do so provided yet another reason for shaken investors to hide in the nearest bunker.
How did it come to this?
The euro zone has been a source of global instability for months. In the latest episode, Finland, which has an impeccable credit rating, was asked to approve a measure that would aid its improvident southern neighbor, Greece. The Finnish Parliament had grave reservations -- it is already contemplating writing off some of its direct loans to Greece. But mindful of the possible consequences, the Finns voted to strengthen a European bailout fund, the inelegantly named European Financial Stability Facility.
That got world markets through Wednesday, but it hardly ended the European financial crisis -- even this phase of it. The next day, it was Germany's turn. After weeks of fierce debate, Parliament passed the measure in a 523-to-85 vote. On Friday, Austria gave its approval. And between now and Oct. 11, Cyprus, Estonia, Malta, the Netherlands and Slovakia will all have their say.
After that, if all 17 euro zone countries have granted approval, the newly empowered 440 billion euro fund (about $600 billion) will be available to give Greece some succor.
"There are a lot of moving parts and a lot could go wrong," said David J. Kostin, the chief United States investment strategist for Goldman Sachs. "And these macro issues are dominating micro ones like whether a particular company in the S.& P. is having a strong quarter -- and many of them are."
For months now, investors have been putting money in a traditional haven -- the United States Treasury market, whose appeal has been burnished by the accommodative monetary policies of the Federal Reserve.
For stocks, though, a vicious circle has developed. The global economy is weak, and stocks worldwide have trended downward.
"The direction of the markets is being determined by geopolitical uncertainty on three continents," Mr. Kostin said. China's possible slowdown, the disappointing economy in the United States and the European financial crisis are all weighing on the markets, he said, with the European predicament likely to be front and center over the next several weeks.
In the case of the European Financial Stability Facility, political leaders and central bankers involved in the rescue effort already appeared to know it wouldn't be enough to resolve the crisis. A vastly greater financial commitment is needed to prevent the crisis from spreading, many analysts say.
The European Central Bank may use some of the fund's money as collateral for making larger loans, effectively "leveraging" the fund and giving it more firepower, but the bank's powers are circumscribed. Any further fundamental changes must also be approved, one by one, by each country in the monetary union.
That is because the euro zone is not a fiscal union or a sovereign state, and its founders didn't prepare for the eventuality that one of its members might be unable to pay its bills -- threatening the stability of banks, countries and markets worldwide. Furthermore, as things stand, it's not clear that the European Union is capable of achieving even the level of governance -- some would call it dysfunction -- that has lately characterized the United States. This helps explain why the European crisis has, if anything, been even harder to resolve than the still-simmering one on this side of the Atlantic, and why these linked crises are not about to disappear anytime soon.
On the American side, with unemployment at 9.1 percent and the economy growing at an anemic rate, Congress and the White House have been unable to agree on another fiscal stimulus plan -- or even on whether further fiscal stimulus is wise. And a Congressional special panel must find $1.2 trillion in budget cuts in time for a Nov. 23 deadline, or else the government will make across-the-board cuts to achieve those savings.
For its part, the Fed has been engaging in monetary stimulus. Its latest foray into unorthodox policy making, known as Operation Twist, is explicitly aimed at lowering bond yields. Because prices and yields move in opposite directions, the Fed's avowed policy is contributing to a long-running bond market rally.
That implies further problems for the stock market, Bank of America Merrill Lynch suggested in a research note last week. "There can be no bull market in equities in the medium term without a bear market in bonds," the note said.
With the threat of another recession high, the stock market has been volatile and range-bound and is likely to stay that way until the bond market rally ends, said Michael Hartnett, chief global equity strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. For that to happen, he said, it "would mean that Bernanke & Company will win the war against deflation, which is obviously what they've been up to the last couple of years." Such a victory "would go hand in hand with much better economic conditions," he said, and demand for riskier assets like stocks would rise.
For now, though, uncertainty reigns, not only in Europe and the United States but also in the Chinese economy, where efforts to curb inflation may also be throttling growth. Still, Mr. Kostin said, the profit outlook remains strong among the global corporations that dominate the Standard & Poor's 500. He expects that the index will rise in the fourth quarter -- closing modestly higher, at 1,250.
But in today's global economy, many little things can easily go wrong. If they do, he said, investing in stocks, particularly in individual stocks, is likely to be very difficult.
"The macro story is dominant," he said. And it hasn't been a very upbeat story.

Full text: HONG KONG -- Standard & Poor's lowered New Zealand's credit rating one notch Friday, adding the country to a lengthening line of developed economies whose credit profiles have been undermined by high debt and the uncertain global economic outlook.
The downgrade followed a similar move by Fitch Ratings, which cut its rating for New Zealand on Thursday and also singled out the country's high foreign debt levels as a cause for concern.
Despite the downgrades, New Zealand's local- and foreign-currency ratings remain near the top end of both agencies' scales. The country's financial system is sound, the agencies said, and New Zealand continues to enjoy plenty of monetary and fiscal flexibility. Its public debt, unlike that of many other developed economies, remains modest.
Debt levels in the household and agriculture sectors, by contrast, are high, while the country's aging population and dependence on commodity income pose challenges for the future.
New Zealand's high level of net external debt is "an outlier" among comparable developed nations, said Andrew Colquhoun, head of Asia-Pacific sovereign ratings at Fitch.
Still, the downgrade highlighted the way that the turmoil sweeping the globe -- prompted by worries over the slow pace of growth in the United States and doubts about the ability of several European countries to meet their debt obligations -- is affecting economies as far afield as New Zealand.
Stock markets in the Asia-Pacific region have been dragged down, along with those in the rest of the world, as investors have pulled funds out of stocks.
The Hang Seng index in Hong Kong, for example, fell 2.3 percent Friday, bringing the decline for the quarter that ended Friday to nearly 22 percent.
Economic data from across the region have shown that economies are growing at a more subdued pace. The latest evidence came Friday in the shape of an index measuring manufacturing activity in China, which showed a reading of 49.9 for September -- the third successive month that the reading was below 50, which signals contraction.
In a report Sept. 21, Standard & Poor's noted that the weaker global backdrop, combined with generally high inflation, could slow the pace of upgrades for some Asia-Pacific sovereigns and could bring rating reductions for countries with weak balance sheets.
Asia-Pacific sovereign ratings have bucked the global trend so far this year with two upgrades (Indonesia and Fiji) and one downgrade (Japan). But several countries in the region now have higher debt burdens and weaker budget positions than they had in 2008, S.&P. said. It named the Cook Islands, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand and Vietnam as countries whose net general government debt levels had risen "significantly" in the past few years.
In Japan and New Zealand, reconstruction efforts after devastating earthquakes this year have added to government spending needs.
That was a factor in S.&P.'s decision Friday to downgrade New Zealand's long-term local-currency rating to AA+ from AAA, and its foreign-currency rating to AA from AA+. The revised ratings are below those that S.&P. has for Australia, but better than those for Japan. Similarly, Fitch now has New Zealand's local-currency rating at AA+ and its foreign-currency rating at AA.
Analysts broadly agree, however, that most emerging economies in Asia are relatively well positioned to weather the turmoil in the United States and Europe. Banks across the region have little direct exposure to the debt of Greece and other beleaguered European economies, while firm domestic demand is likely to help insulate the region's economies from any downturn in overseas demand for Asian-made goods.
Exports to the West are less important now than they were before the collapse of Lehman Brothers, Frederic Neumann, a regional economist for HSBC in Hong Kong, said in a research note Friday. "Overall economic growth should hold up better even if shipments to the U.S. and the E.U. decline more sharply," he said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text: The recession was bad for everyone, but women experienced at least one silver lining: Their median earnings edged a bit closer to men's.
The progress was bittersweet, however. It happened not because women earned more, but because men earned less, according to an analysis of new Census Bureau data.
Median earnings for men, adjusted for inflation, fell by $2,433 -- or 6 percent -- from 2007 to 2010, according to the analysis, by the American Human Development Project, a social research organization. Women's earnings, meanwhile, fell by just $253 in the same period, a drop of 0.9 percent.
For men, it was another sad chapter in the painful tale of the recession, which officially ended in June 2009 and battered them more ferociously than it did women. For women, whose economic fortunes have been on a slow but steady rise relative to men's since the 1970s, it was a small, if unsatisfying, victory.
"The recession was devastating for men," said Kristen Lewis, co-director of the project, which is part of the New York-based Social Science Research Council. Women, on the other hand, "have come through it with no significant change in their buying power," she said.
Some of the recession's steepest declines were in industries that tend to be dominated by men. Earnings in construction, for example, fell by 5 percent, the analysis found. Meanwhile, median earnings in health care and technical occupations, popular among women, increased by 3 percent.
Median earnings for men were also dragged down by workers who lost jobs or had their hours cut back. (The statistic included any worker ages 25 to 64 who had been working full or part time at any point in the years measured.)
"When you have unemployment go from 5 percent to 10 percent, people are going to have lower annual earnings because they are working less," said Betsey Stevenson, assistant professor of business and public policy at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.
The construction industry shed a whopping 1.4 million male workers during the recession, the analysis found. On the other hand, the service sector, which includes some of the lowest-paying jobs, like waitress and housekeeper, added jobs for both men and women. Earnings in the sector declined by 6 percent for men, as they took lower-paying jobs, but stayed flat for women.
Women did not have as far to fall, said Sarah Burd-Sharps, who is co-director of the American Human Development Project with Ms. Lewis. Women are heavily represented at the bottom of the earnings ladder and have lower salaries than men across all occupations. A typical woman in the service sector earned $14,792 last year, compared with $21,104 for a typical man.
But the gap is shrinking. The high-paying fields of management, business and finance gained 376,000 women during the recession, while shedding 119,000 men, according to the study. Women's earnings in those occupations stayed flat, while men's salaries dropped 3 percent.
This year of budget cuts does not bode well for women, who are heavily represented in local government jobs, like teaching, Professor Stevenson said.
Even so, in recent months, there has been an uptick in women's earnings, she said. In early 2010, women's median weekly earnings were 79 cents for every dollar earned by men. By the second quarter of this year they were at 83 cents. That was all the more surprising because female unemployment, lower than men's through much of the recession, has now started to rise.
"What you see in these earnings is another step towards financial equality," Professor Stevenson said.

Full text: SINCE mid-August, world markets have repeatedly moved with stomach-churning ups and downs. And in response, many investors feel they must take some action for fear that doing nothing will cost more than doing something.
The sheer magnitude of the world's problems -- high unemployment and legislative gridlock in the United States, debt problems in Europe, signs of a slowdown in China -- makes this a scary time for investors.
But what about the urge to take some sort of action? As I have written before, the better strategy is almost always to focus on a long-term plan and not abandon it the moment it gets tested. After the last three years, this is tougher to do than ever.
"It's very hard to do nothing when everybody is trying to talk you into doing something, even when it's wrong," said Susan Fulton, founder and president of FBB Capital Partners.
Michael Martin, a trader and the author of the new book "The Inner Voice of Trading" (FT Press), put it a different way. The big risk for average investors now is confusing volatility with opportunity.
He said professional traders become more wary when prices are changing rapidly for no fundamental reason. And he equated the market, with its wild swings, to a drunken uncle at a holiday dinner. "When someone's behavior becomes more volatile, you don't want to warm up to that person," he said. "You want to get away."
But ignoring those swings can be difficult. Below are some bad ideas as well as some slightly contrarian thoughts that may offer comfort.
BAD IDEAS Fear causes investors to do all sorts of things that could hurt them in the long run.
The recent drop in gold prices to about $1,600 an ounce from just under $1,900 in August has damped down some of the enthusiasm for gold. But the gyrations in stocks have led some investors to think that they can find something there that will soar as gold did.
"People want to swing for the fences," Ms. Fulton said. "We're not going to have stocks that multiply by 10 in the near future."
She said she advised clients to look instead at companies that had a lot of cash and were paying steady dividends. There is a predictability to those stocks that will help battered portfolios.
A variation on the stock-picking strategy involves using tax losses accumulated over the years to bet heavily on a risky company. The hope is that any gains will get an investor back to even and also be tax-free.
The problem is that unless the investor picks the next Google, his losses could be substantial. And even if he's lucky enough to pick a stock that appreciates greatly, it could be years before he sells the stocks and is able to use the tax losses to offset the gains.
"You should use your tax losses on things that can benefit you today," said Lewis Altfest, chief investment officer of Altfest Personal Wealth Management.
Mr. Altfest said a client recently wanted him to put money into some risky stocks because he was down so much. Instead of agreeing, Mr. Altfest suggested the client reallocate his portfolio back to 65 percent stocks and 35 percent bonds and then go back to that allocation whenever the stock position dropped below 63 percent.
"He's got a human problem now -- he's behind," Mr. Altfest said. "I could explain to him that this is the worst recession we've had in 80 years. It might help him intellectually, but he hurts, and he wants an answer."
CONSOLING THOUGHTS One of the great comforts to average investors in a volatile market is dollar-cost averaging. This is a fancy way of saying you should invest your money over a period of time as opposed to investing it all at once, which is known as lump-sum investing.
Proponents of dollar-cost averaging offer two arguments. By putting money into, say, a stock over time, you will be buying shares at varying prices, which will benefit you in the end. This seems particularly appealing when stock prices are rising and falling so much.
The second advantage is psychological: If you put all your money into an investment and it is worth 10 percent less the next day, you're going to feel horrible about it. Worse, you may also be less inclined to make further investments or pull your money out.
But new research from Gerstein Fisher, a money manager in New York, raises questions about that investing philosophy. It found that from January 1926 to December 2010, investing your money on one day yielded better results over a 20-year period than investing the same amount of money in equal chunks over 12 months.
In the 70 percent of the time that investing everything all at once did better, it did better by 94 percentage points. When dollar-cost averaging did better, it did so only by 77 percentage points. Over a 20-year period, lump-sum investing added about 2 percent to annual returns, the study found. This ratio continued to hold true over the past decade.
"The conclusion is the faster you invest the money, the better you do," said Gregg Fisher, president and chief investment officer of Gerstein Fisher. "Dollar-cost averaging's greatest value is to get people comfortable investing. The rational investor would not do it because it doesn't make any sense, but we're not rational."
Normally, most investors don't have large sums of money to invest at once. But right now, many are sitting on large cash positions. Mr. Fisher did note that the person who put money in slowly was still better off than the person who tried to guess the direction of the market.
Another bit of consolation is that government bonds may be better bets than many advisers have been saying. In August, I wrote that advisers were telling clients that yields on Treasury bonds could not go any lower. The fear then was that investors were locking in low yields and that any bit of good news would cause yields to rise and create losses for the investors. But that has not happened.
But Bob Andres, chief investment officer and strategist at Merion Wealth Partners, said investors had been too optimistic. There are few signs that the global economy is getting any better.
"If you're at 2.5 percent on a 10-year Treasury or lower, people have a tendency to say they can't go any lower," Mr. Andres said. "That's a mistake. That's underestimating the problems the global economy has. Do I think we can go back down to 1.5? Yes, I do."
However depressing his analysis, it has some merit. At the beginning of the year, the yield on the 10-year Treasury was 3.36 percent, which did not seem like such a great return then. But last week, when the yield on the same bond hit a low of 1.72 percent, it looked a lot better.
So while inflation would still be bad for bond returns, there is enough bleak news coming from the United States and Europe to make a rush out of Treasury bonds premature.
"Not losing money is much more important than making money in this environment," Mr. Andres said. "Intuitive feel is a dangerous thing in a market like this."
Under pressure, the best advice may be to stay the course.

Full text: Stocks were mostly higher in a volatile session on Thursday as stronger-than-expected economic data and German approval of a strengthened euro zone crisis fund relieved two of the worst fears hanging over the market.
But the Nasdaq composite index slipped as the stocks of Chinese companies listed in the United States fell on the news of an investigation of accounting practices.
The Labor Department said initial applications for unemployment benefits fell to a five-month low last week.
Europe again averted disaster in its debt crisis when members of the German Parliament rallied behind Chancellor Angela Merkel to approve a stronger euro zone bailout fund on Thursday.
"The vote in Germany is obviously positive news and is exactly what is needed to give the region the go-ahead to recapitalize their banks," said Deirdre Dennehy, portfolio manager at the Rockland Trust in Rockland, Mass.
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 143.08 points, or 1.3 percent, to close at 11,153.98. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 9.34 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,160.40. But the Nasdaq composite index dropped 10.82 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,480.76.
The Chinese Internet search engine Baidu, whose American depository shares were down 9.2 percent at $110.29 on the Nasdaq, and other Chinese companies listed in the United States were among the biggest losers after a securities regulator told Reuters that the Justice Department was investigating accounting irregularities at Chinese companies listed on exchanges in the United States.
Kevin Kruszenski, head of listed trading at KeyBanc Capital Markets in Cleveland, said the news was especially bad because markets were already experiencing high levels of uncertainty and volatility.
High-tech shares pressured the Nasdaq, with Amazon.com off 3.2 percent at $222.44 after a sharp rally on Wednesday. Advanced Micro Devices sank 13.7 percent to $5.31 after it cut its third-quarter revenue outlook, prompting many analysts to downgrade their views on the stock.
Apple shares fell 1.6 percent to $390.57 on profit taking after gaining more than 16 percent during the quarter.
Other large-cap Internet names were also down. Netflix sank 11 percent to $113.19, while Yahoo lost 5.4 percent to $13.42.
A Merrill Lynch index of Internet stocks, which includes Amazon and Yahoo, fell 3.01 percent.
Market volatility is likely to remain high as traders react to European headlines and try to gauge the commitment of governments and institutions as they work to prevent a Greek default.
End-of-quarter repositioning will also influence market movement. Friday will be the last day of the third quarter.
Interest rates were steady. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 5/32, to 101 3/32, and the yield rose to 2.00 percent from 1.99 percent late Wednesday.
Volume was lower than usual as some bullion traders were off for the Jewish New Year holiday, Rosh Hashana.

Signs of a Crash, Not a Recession

Author: MARTIN HUTCHINSON and ROB COX

Full text: The stock market may be ahead of the economy. That suggests a crash is more likely than a second recession.
There are many ways to value equity markets. A simple one is to compare an index to nominal gross domestic product. What ratio counts as high is a matter of debate, but 1995 is a good starting point. The Dow Jones industrial average first climbed above 4,000 in February 1995, which was then almost 50 percent above its 1987 peak. It was 38 percent below the level of December 1996, when Alan Greenspan warned of irrational exuberance.
If the market's value had increased in line with nominal G.D.P. since 1995, the Dow would be 105 percent higher, at 8,200 today. If that sounds low, consider that inflating the Dow's bear market low of 777 points in August 1982 gives it a current level of 3,600.
Even after its recent decline, the market remains far above these levels. The performance certainly owes nothing to superior economic prospects. Rather, ultralow interest rates together with increased leverage inflated corporate profits over the years.
In addition, modern communications technology has enabled multinationals to profit from low-cost global sourcing of labor. Finally, money-supply expansion, with the St. Louis Fed's broad money-supply measure up 262 percent since 1995 compared with the G.D.P.'s 105 percent increase, has inflated all asset prices.
Interest rates must eventually rise, to prevent inflation and the decapitalization of the United States through low savings and capital outflow. This will raise the cost of capital compared with labor, which would put millions back to work. Normalization need not cause a recession, although it may slow growth in some emerging economies.
But the return to conventional monetary policy would deflate the asset bubble and reduce corporate profits. That's almost bound to cause a major bear market in stocks, with the Dow heading toward 3,600. Investors, both individual and institutional, will squawk, but those newly restored to employment may rejoice to see, in Churchill's words, "finance less proud and industry more content."
Education Battle
Spring is in the air in Santiago, but the Chilean winter is still in season. Huge street protests over education are expected to resume on Thursday. As easy as it may seem to lump these with unrest elsewhere, Chile's unrest is different. Fundamentally, it is a test of the economic model that has made the nation Latin America's shining star.
Chile's educational system reflects the country's philosophical preference for private, market-based -- rather than public -- solutions to social and economic problems. After the brutal dictatorship of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, Chile embarked on a free-market path unlike any of its neighbors'.
This has mostly served Chile well. In 1990, per capita G.D.P. stood at $5,000 a year, on a purchasing power parity basis, in line with the rest of Latin America. Today it's close to $20,000, some 50 percent ahead of the region, calculates Banchile, a brokerage firm. In that sense, the education debate is a developed world problem. The question isn't whether Chileans go to school, but rather the quality of instruction they receive.
Yet here the Chilean model hasn't delivered, in ways that could hamper future growth. The country ranks well below the average of members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in reading, math and science scores, despite households shouldering more of the cost of education than in any other nation. Growth in productivity has been declining for years. Anecdotally, employers complain of a work force unsuited to their needs.
It's hard not to see Chile's application of free-market principles to learning as part of the problem. It has created a stratified system where fewer than half of high school students attend public schools because of their low quality. And despite Chile's financial gains in the post-Pinochet era, the government has been slow to add new public universities.
As a result, protesters want to abolish the profit motive entirely from education. For the center-right government of Sebastian Pinera, the country's billionaire president, that would be a repudiation of the laissez faire principles on which Chile's success is based.
But polls show most Chileans favor educational overhaul -- and that Mr. Pinera is the least popular Chilean leader since Pinochet. Put it all together, and the price of thawing the Chilean winter looks evident: sacrificing a wee bit of free-market ideology.

Full text: MUMBAI, India -- WHEN the Ssangyong Motor company, a South Korean sport utility vehicle maker, came up for sale twice in the last seven years, the Indian auto company Mahindra & Mahindra passed both times.
Last year, Mahindra was finally ready to pull the trigger, acquiring a 70 percent stake in Ssangyong for $460 million. The deal, which closed in March, was another indication that Indian companies were growing more confident in making cross-border acquisitions.
Long kept away from the rest of the world by protectionist government policies, Indian companies are increasingly going global. In the last 18 months, Indian companies spent $28.4 billion on outbound mergers and acquisitions, a little more than the $26.4 billion that foreign companies spent on Indian deals, according to Grant Thornton, the accounting firm.
"A lot of Indian companies are thinking about the world very differently," said Vedika Bhandarkar, who heads the investment bank and global markets group at Credit Suisse in Mumbai. "They are saying, 'It's not enough for me to be a leader with a 20 percent or an 'X' percent market share in India. What I do needs to be globally competitive.' "
That need had helped sway Mahindra executives when it came to the South Korean company.
"For us, the last two times Ssangyong was sold - four and seven years ago - the time was not right," said Pawan Goenka, who runs Mahindra's automotive and farm equipment business. But now, he said, "going global is a consideration. Ssangyong has a fairly strong network of overseas distributors, 1,200 outside Korea; we have 400 to 500."
While merger activity by Indian companies has slackened in recent months as global financial markets have become more volatile, analysts and bankers say acquisitions have been surprisingly strong, especially in light of the poor performance of the Indian stock market. The benchmark Nifty stock index is down more than 21 percent since early November, and initial public offerings fell to 12 in the first six months of this year, from 27 in the first six months of 2010.
In going abroad, Indian companies are often looking to acquire new technology, enter new markets and secure resources like coal.
"As Indian companies move into more frontline products, they need specialized technology," said Rajiv Kumar, secretary general of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce in New Delhi. "They are also seeking market access. And third, they are buying natural resources."
Mahindra, for instance, was drawn to Ssangyong because of the South Korean company's line of premium and higher-priced sport utility vehicles, which complements the Indian company's more modestly priced, rugged S.U.V.'s built for India's more cost-conscious consumers.
The largest recent outbound deal from India was Bharti Airtel's $10.7 billion acquisition last year of Zain, a wireless phone company that operated in 15 African countries including Kenya and Nigeria - markets that it had long hoped to expand into but which it would have been difficult to enter without an acquisition. Other big deals have included the Adani Group's $2 billion acquisition of the Abbott Point port in Australia that Adani intends to use to ship coal to its power plants in India.
In August, Essar, an Indian energy and steel conglomerate, bought a British oil refinery from Shell for $350 million. Executives said they jumped at the opportunity because it would have cost $5 billion to build a new refinery. The company's other divisions have also bought call centers in Europe and coal mines in Indonesia and the United States.
"An asset at a good price is always worth looking at as long as it fits into the overall strategy of our growth plan," Prashant Ruia, chief executive of the Essar Group, said in an e-mail.
While strong, Indian companies' recent outward thrust is still more muted than their last major buying spree in 2006 and 2007, before the financial crisis, when India's largest conglomerate, the Tata Group, bought Corus Steel and Jaguar Land Rover, becoming the largest manufacturing company in Britain.
The more recent deals tend to be smaller, and foreigners are just as likely to be buying into India as Indians are to be going abroad, Ms. Bhandarkar, the Credit Suisse banker, said. Recent inbound acquisitions include BP's $7.2 billion purchase of a 30 percent stake in the offshore oil and gas fields of Reliance Industries.
Ms. Bhandarkar said many Indian companies were eager to expand further, especially into natural resources, but they were reluctant to do so because commodity prices were high.
"If the slowdown continues, and you see commodity prices come down," she said, "you might see more transactions because the Indian power companies certainly need more coal."
Another reason Indian firms may be looking abroad is that they are increasingly frustrated with Indian policy makers. Corporate executives here complain that the government is moving far too slowly to liberalize the economy and improve infrastructure. In recent months, Indian leaders have put off proposals to loosen restrictions on investments in insurance, retail and manufacturing.
It has not helped that India is also struggling with high inflation and rising interest rates. Wholesale inflation has been hovering around 10 percent for more than a year. The Reserve Bank of India has raised its benchmark interest rates 12 times since March 2010, to 8.25 percent, and has signaled that it may not be finished yet.
By contrast, prices and interest rates in much of the industrialized world have been flat or rising only slowly.
Mr. Ruia of Essar said Indian companies were indeed frustrated with the slow pace of change in the country, but their overseas acquisitions were not motivated by that unease.
"It is true that many big industrial houses are concerned about the lack of any significant movement forward in terms of policy initiatives," he said, "but everyone also knows these are short-term problems, and in the long run with better governance these issues will sort themselves out."

Full text: The world has barely dug out of recession and the global economy is again slowing dangerously. Most leaders seem eager to make things even worse.
Instead of looking for ways to reignite growth, Europe's leaders -- and Republicans on Capitol Hill -- are determined to slash public spending. Europe's fixation on austerity is also compounding its debt crisis, bringing the Continent even closer to the brink. Meanwhile, China's government, which is struggling to contain inflation without letting its currency rise, has been trying to slow domestic demand, allowing its trade surplus to balloon.
Each of these policies is wrong. In combination, they are likely to tip the world into a deep recession.
The International Monetary Fund has cut its forecast for global growth this year to 4 percent, from the 4.3 percent it had forecast in April. It expects rich countries to grow by only 1.6 percent. That may be too optimistic.
The I.M.F. forecasts that the United States will grow by 1.5 percent this year and 1.9 percent in 2012. But that assumes Congress will continue payroll tax cuts and extended unemployment insurance, as President Obama has called for. Mark Zandi of Moody's Economy.com warns that if Congress fails to do so, the country will probably slip into recession.
Europe is in even worse shape. Rich nations that could afford to spend more to increase growth, like Germany and Britain, are instead slashing spending. Germany and its rich neighbors are also insisting that Greece, Portugal and other debtor countries accept even stiffer doses of austerity to regain the confidence of investors. Sending these economies into near collapse means that they will never be able to dig out or pay off their creditors.
While the German Parliament is expected to approve a new $600 billion bailout fund on Thursday, many European leaders already admit it is too small to deal with turmoil that now also threatens Spain and Italy.
It is true that many countries do not have the money to pay for policies to promote employment and growth. The United States, Britain, Germany and China could boost global demand by spending more at home and buying more from weaker countries that cannot stimulate their own economies.
The United States government must cut its budget deficit, but the economy must recover first. According to Mr. Zandi, President Obama's $450 billion jobs plan could add 1.9 million jobs in 2012 and cut the unemployment rate by a percentage point. With interest rates so low, the government could easily pay for a bigger program.
The British government has similar room to maneuver. And its stubborn insistence on fiscal austerity is already causing havoc. But the countries that could do most to assist global growth are China and Germany.
China today makes 14 percent of the world's economic product but consumes only 6 percent of it. Allowing its currency to rise would help combat inflation by lowering the domestic price of imports, while increasing the spending power of the Chinese people.
Germany's export model is also failing, producing little growth while sucking demand from its neighbors. Germany could easily raise money at low cost to stimulate its own consumption. Yet not only has it refused stimulus spending, it is imposing austerity on the rest of Europe -- forcing weak countries to contract their economies in exchange for its aid.
Economic policy makers have made similar mistakes before. That is what caused the Great Depression. There is not a lot of time left to get this right.

Full text: In 1902, the International Banking Corporation, a predecessor of Citigroup, went in search of the next big gold rush. But it did not go west. It opened up small outposts in Shanghai, Calcutta and Manila. In 1914, another Citigroup ancestor opened a branch in Buenos Aires, becoming the first big American player in the city.
The story of Wall Street in the emerging markets has been a long one, filled with twists and turns. Most recently, deal makers and big banks have been contending with the global market volatility, which is rocking such risky locales.
But in the age of globalization, with developed economies beginning to slow, emerging markets - once considered the final frontier - are beginning to bear fruit for patient investors and firms that have waited decades, and in some cases more than a century.
Three of the largest markets for initial public offerings last year were Hong Kong, Shanghai and Shenzhen, China. Private equity firms focused on emerging markets raised $22.6 billion in the first half of 2011, compared with $23.5 billion for all of last year. And Chile, Ukraine and Thailand are among the fastest-growing markets for deals.
Wall Street titans can truly claim the title of Masters of the Universe - or at least the World.
"Today, Horace Greeley would say, "Go east, young man,' " said Richard Peterson, an analyst at Standard & Poor's Capital IQ.
Antonio Quintella, chief executive of Credit Suisse's Americas business, has had a front-row seat to the evolution of Wall Street. A native of Brazil, he was a summer associate at Credit Suisse in 1991 and rejoined the firm in 1997.
Since then, he has watched Brazil get its inflation problems and debt under control. Now, the big question is whether Brazil is too hot.
Despite a spate of near collapses in the region, Credit Suisse has remained committed. In 1998, the firm bought Banco de Investimentos Garantia and later acquired the asset manager and private bank Hedging-Griffo.
Through such acquisitions, Credit Suisse has built one of most powerful investment banks in Latin America. "There used to be no capital markets business there," Mr. Quintella said. "Now it's a very significant part of our business."
Here's a good measure of the significance. In 2010, Mr. Quintella was the firm's highest paid banker, taking home $17.4 million. He bested his own boss, Brady W. Dougan, the Credit Suisse chief executive, who made $14.4 million.
Big private equity firms are also investing heavily, often at considerable cost, to build a presence in countries that were once considered unthinkable. Last year, the Blackstone Group acquired Patria, Brazil's top alternative asset manager.
The Carlyle Group, the Washington firm that made its name investing in military and aerospace, has set up more than a dozen new offices in the last five years. It has the globe covered with bases in China, Beirut, Dubai, Hong Kong and Istanbul, as well as Lagos, Nigeria; Mumbai, India; Sao Paulo, Brazil; and Seoul, South Korea.
"The interest among Western institutional investors to getting exposure to China, Brazil and India is clear. It's a big mind shift," said Sarah Alexander, president of the Emerging Markets Private Equity Association. And she added, they've been looking farther afield. "You've got Indonesia on the map, Colombia, Peru."
David M. Rubenstein, the co-founder of Carlyle, spent two decades on an airplane, fund-raising for his firm, often meeting with investors in remote parts of the world to put money in the United States. Now, Americans are asking him about opportunities abroad, and sovereign wealth funds want investment in their own backyards.
In 2007, I traveled to Dubai, where Mr. Rubenstein was speaking at a conference and raising money for a new Middle East fund that, at the time, was considered a speculative bet. He intended to invest in places like Libya.
Over lunch, he recalled a phone conversation the previous night with his mother about his trip. "Of course, she asks, 'Is it safe? There's always bombs going off and wars.' " He rolled his eyes: "I told her Dubai is probably a lot safer than Florida."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text: Washington
BY virtually ignoring trade, President Obama and Congressional Republicans are missing a major opportunity to create jobs. The United States runs an annual trade deficit of about $600 billion, or 4 percent of our entire economy. Eliminating that imbalance would create three million to four million jobs, according to Commerce Department estimates, at no cost to the budget.
It is clear that our economy can no longer rely on consumer borrowing, housing bubbles, government deficits and super-low interest rates. The United States must start selling much more to other countries, especially China and other emerging markets that are growing at 6 percent or more per year.
Mr. Obama has set a goal of doubling the nation's exports over five years. But his administration has done little to achieve that goal, which is inadequate to begin with. For one thing, the focus should not be the level of exports but the overall deficit -- the difference between what we import from abroad and what we sell overseas.
This will of course require us to get our house in order: balancing the budget over time; investing in education, infrastructure and scientific research; and making taxation and regulation more efficient. But there are three steps we can take that would pay off more quickly.
First, the United States must, in effect, weaken the dollar by 10 to 20 percent. This step alone would produce one million to three million jobs. It's been done before: In 1971, President Richard M. Nixon ended the dollar's convertibility in gold, and in 1985, Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III reached an agreement with foreign countries to devalue the dollar relative to the yen and the Deutsche mark.
The bulk of our current misalignment is vis-a-vis the Chinese currency, the renminbi, and a small group of other Asian currencies. Partly in response to pressure from the United States and other countries, China has let its currency rise modestly over the past year, but it continues to intervene in foreign exchange markets, purchasing one billion to two billion United States dollars every day to prevent the value of the renminbi from rising more quickly.
The artificially low value of the renminbi -- it is 20 to 30 percent less than what it should be -- amounts to a subsidy on Chinese exports and a tariff on imports from the United States and other countries. The United States should take China to the World Trade Organization in Geneva for engaging in illegal competitive currency devaluation, and retaliate if China does not cease this protectionist policy. Many members of Congress have urged such action, but Mr. Obama, like President George W. Bush before him, has been too timid to take this step.
Along with pressuring the Chinese, Congress and Mr. Obama should reduce the budget deficit, the Federal Reserve should continue to pursue an expansionary monetary policy and politicians should drop the "strong dollar" rhetoric of the past. An overvalued dollar only exacerbates the trade imbalance.
Second, the United States must negotiate a reduction in foreign regulations, monopoly practices and other barriers to the export of American services. Work done by American architects, engineers, lawyers and accountants for foreign customers is an export, just like Boeing planes and Caterpillar tractors. We run a $750 billion trade deficit in goods but a $150 billion trade surplus in services.
Services make up 80 percent of our economy, and we have a huge opportunity to serve emerging markets like Brazil, China and India. We could expand services exports by at least $200 billion a year by completing a free-trade agreement with South Korea; pursuing a trade agreement known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership; and reviving the Doha round of global trade talks, with a focus on services. The administration has not pursued these steps with enough vigor.
Third, we must get serious about defending the intellectual property rights of our companies against theft by foreign companies and governments. A recent study by the International Trade Commission suggested that Chinese companies alone, with support or at least acquiescence from their government, are stealing $50 billion to $100 billion in United States products each year. The global total is probably at least twice as large.
The theft of intellectual property cuts across such highly competitive products as Microsoft Windows, Apple iPads, groundbreaking pharmaceuticals and award-winning films. Negotiations have failed to achieve significant progress. We must take many more intellectual property cases to the W.T.O. and credibly threaten unilateral retaliation if the foreign piracy continues.
These steps are no doubt aggressive. They would require taking tough initiatives with some of our main trading partners, especially China, and giving trade a more prominent, even central, role in our overall foreign policy. To be sure, some American corporations will fret that these actions would needlessly antagonize the Chinese and threaten a trade war. Some economists worry that a weaker dollar would invite inflation and endanger the dollar's status as the dominant global currency. I believe these fears are overblown. The real threat to the world trading system is, in fact, the protectionist policies, including undervalued currencies, of other countries and the vast trade imbalances that result.
Not every country can expand its economy through exports, because one nation's smaller deficit is another's smaller surplus. But the United States has a unique claim now to pursue such a strategy, because it has run large deficits for most of the last three decades, become the largest debtor country and accommodated other countries' desire for export-led prosperity. If we want to avoid bankruptcy and raise growth, we have got to attack the trade deficit.

Full text: When it comes to deal-making, a global perspective matters.
As economic engines stall in the United States and Western Europe, private equity firms, corporate suitors and investment bankers are increasingly venturing overseas, touching down in far-flung locales like Uganda, Malaysia and Chile.
While mergers and acquisitions in such markets are still small compared to those in developed countries, international deal-making is on the rise. The 20 most active countries in the emerging and frontier markets - nations found in Latin America, the Middle East, Asia and sub-Saharan Africa - have notched nearly $377 billion of deals this year, up roughly 3 percent from the same period in 2010, according to Thomson Reuters.
The countries share a common characteristic: a growing economy. China's gross domestic product increased by an estimated 10.3 percent last year, India's by 10.4 percent and Peru's by 8.8 percent. In contrast, the United States economy rose 2.8 percent.
But forging deals in developing regions comes with a unique set of uncertainties, including political, economic and regulatory risks. Wal-Mart Stores pulled out of Moscow late last year, citing an inhospitable climate for acquisitions. Ikea, fed up with corruption in Russia, suspended further investments there in 2009.
In Brazil, rising inflation has spooked investors, contributing to a 26 percent decline this year in the MSCI Brazil index. As the market wobbles, merger activity has declined by nearly a third from 2010.
China, however, has shown no signs of slowing. Deal volume in the country has already passed the $100 billion mark this year, up 15 percent from the same period in 2010. The transactions represent a range of industries, including industrials, finance, technology and retail.
Deal activity also has soared in Indonesia. But with a less developed and robust economy, the acquisitions have been focused on mining, reflecting the country's rich resources. In June, Vallar Investments agreed to pay $2 billion for Bumi Resources Minerals of Indonesia.
"There is this image of a frontier, and you think of someone getting hungry in Africa," said Marko Dimitrijevic, founder of Everest Capital, a hedge fund investing abroad. "The reality is some of the fastest-growing economies in the world are in the frontier area."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

GRAPHICS: The 20 most active deal-making countries in emerging and frontier markets: CASE IN POINT MEXICO: Domestic companies dominate deal-making here, accounting for 90 percent of the volume this year. In one of the largest acquisitions, Embotelladoras Arca, which distributes Coca-Cola products, bought its rival Grupo Continental for $2.1 billion. The dynamic is different from other strong deal-making markets in Latin America, where foreign buyers account for much of the activity. Nondomestic companies represent more than 80 percent of the acquirers in Argentina and Peru. In Brazil, it's a roughly 50-50 split.; CASE IN POINT TURKEY: The fast-growing economy is undergoing a housing boom, a trend reflected in the equity markets. Over the last year, the five largest public offerings in the country have been for companies operating in the real estate sector; the Emlak Konut Real Estate Investment Trust, which builds commercial and residential complexes in Turkey, raised $791 million in December.; CASE IN POINT CHINA: Local investment banks and joint ventures with domestic players account for half of the 10 top deal-makers in the country, which has been the most active place for mergers and acquisitions among emerging and frontier markets this year. In one of the country's biggest deals, Nestle moved to buy a majority stake in the candy maker Hsu Fu Chi in July.; CASE IN POINT UGANDA: In March, the Chinese oil giant Cnooc and Total of France agreed to pay $2.9 billion for a two-thirds stake in the country's Tullow Oil -- the largest deal in Uganda since 2000. In all, Cnooc has made seven deals outside its borders over the last year. It agreed to buy the rest of Argentina's Pan American Energy for $7.1 billion through Bridas Corporation, a related oil exploration company in which Cnooc has a 50 percent stake.

Abstract: [...] if everyone is cutting at the same time, and in an uncoordinated way, the result may be a fierce economic contraction for Europe as a whole. [...] without growth, there is very little hope of getting out of the "debt trap," whereby more cuts in government spending result in recession, lower tax receipts and larger deficits.

Full text: PARIS -- Angela Merkel, Germany's chancellor, finds herself once again in the politically perilous position of balancing the future of Europe and its common currency against a German public that is unhappy at the price the country will have to pay. And, as before, as the euro crisis has unfolded, she finds herself fighting for measures that most experts have already dismissed as inadequate.
Mrs. Merkel needs parliamentary support to carry out decisions made more than two months ago in Brussels, and to bolster her case she met with the Greek prime minister, George A. Papandreou, on Tuesday evening in Berlin. It was a kind of morality play, intended to show to skeptical German voters how the Greek government intends to keep its promises to continue cutting public spending and services to meet stiff deficit requirements, despite increasing political opposition.
Mr. Papandreou spoke again of the "great will for change" in Greece, while Mrs. Merkel talked once more of her "confidence" that her wavering parliamentary coalition would vote on Thursday for an expansion of the European bailout fund, which was agreed to more than two months ago in Brussels.
By the time the entire process is finished, about mid-October if all goes well, Europe's leaders will have a newly expanded European Financial Stability Facility that most analysts say will be, at $600 billion, grossly inadequate to extinguish the crisis, since it lacks the means to cope with the larger economies of Italy and Spain.
It seems another example of too little, too late on the part of the leaders of the 17-nation euro zone. But it is also another example of sharply differing analyses of the core problem of the euro, making a solution hard to reach.
The German analysis, shared by the Dutch and others in prosperous northern Europe, like the Finns, sees as the main problem the indiscipline and profligacy of others, especially in the south, like Greece, Portugal, Italy and Spain, which have run up high debts or fiscal deficits.
To rebuild confidence, this analysis says, the sinners must repent, restructure their economies and fix themselves. The road to redemption requires hard work, discipline, sacrifice and pain, even punishment for previous misbehavior.
Mr. Papandreou, acutely aware of this strain of thought and the threat it poses to Greece, sought on Tuesday to calm passions. "We must stop blaming each other for our different weaknesses and unite together with our different strengths," he said in a speech to a business group in Berlin. "Even Germany depends on Europe, its biggest trading partner, for growth and jobs."
The problem with the German analysis, notes Simon Tilford, chief economist for the Center for European Reform in London, is that it is not simply self-righteous, ignoring the bad loans German banks made to the troubled nations, but arguably wrong. It is "probably incompatible," he added, with the survival of the euro zone, which all leaders insist is their aim.
Growth is the key, the counter-argument goes, not austerity.
Everyone agrees that countries like Greece need to cut their deficits. But if everyone is cutting at the same time, and in an uncoordinated way, the result may be a fierce economic contraction for Europe as a whole. And without growth, there is very little hope of getting out of the "debt trap," whereby more cuts in government spending result in recession, lower tax receipts and larger deficits.
"If there is austerity everywhere, where is the engine for growth?" said Jean-Paul Fitoussi, professor of economics at the Institute of Political Studies in Paris. "If there is no consumption, no reason to invest, difficulty in accessing the credit market, where is the growth? The only engine that is functioning in this view is the engine of depression, and this will worsen the sovereign debt and deficit problem."
The Germans and northerners, Mr. Fitoussi said, still believe that austerity and recession eventually will lead to stability, confidence and growth. "But there is no way what the Germans are saying can be true without divine intervention or a belief in miracles," he said. "No austerity program can lead to growth in a period of discontinuity in the global economy and slowing economic activity everywhere."
Mr. Fitoussi has just done a study of economic growth in France, which is currently nearly flat, and which will have a growth rate of about 0.8 percent in 2012 if little changes, he said. "But if all the countries in Europe follow this austerity program," Mr. Fitoussi said, France also will fall into recession, and its economy will shrink by 1 percent.
Restructuring Greek debt will not solve its competitiveness problem, which could take 10 to 15 years, said Martin Kocher, a professor of economics at the University of Munich. "Greece will only be able to achieve higher levels of growth when it becomes more competitive again."
Mr. Tilford and others argue that countries like Germany, which benefit from very low interest rates given the panic about other countries' sovereign debt, need to raise their economic activity and consumption, while the European Central Bank, which raised interest rates in July out of misplaced fears of inflation, should cut them again and pump more money into the euro zone.
But such a policy runs against the German analysis of the problem and of the role of the central bank. And major institutional reform of the euro zone -- like forming a common treasury -- would require a sacrifice of sovereignty that seems to exceed the political appetites of Europe's leaders. The German enthusiasm for further European integration seems to be waning, unless it is on German terms, which would mean no transfer of money from creditors to debtors.
In recent days, European leaders have felt increasing pressure to deal effectively with the debt crisis from the United States and Asia, where financial markets took a beating last week on fears of contagion. Mrs. Merkel has had to expend considerable political capital to get even her own coalition and the German parliament ready to endorse the decisions of July 21, and a majority in her own coalition is not yet solid. She particularly wishes to avoid having to rely for a majority on the opposition Social Democrats and Greens, which would be a blow to her authority.
But she has to get the measure passed. "Anything else would be a catastrophe for the government at this point," said Gero Neugebauer, a political scientist at the Free University of Berlin.
Yet, those decisions have already been discounted by the markets and are being overrun by events. They will have to be quickly followed by others of a larger magnitude, or the crisis will return in greater force.
"That such a moderate agreement is inciting and inflating so much ill feeling in Germany is very worrying," Mr. Tilford said. "It casts doubt that in the next six to nine months Germany will move fast and far enough to keep the car on the road."
