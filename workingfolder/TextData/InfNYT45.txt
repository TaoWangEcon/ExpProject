Abstract: The Congressional Budget Office projects 54 million uninsured people in 2019; the actuary for the federal government's Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services projects 57 million. If current trends continue, the number of underinsured Americans -- those who have coverage too skimpy to pay substantial medical bills or protect them from high out-of-pocket spending -- will also rise from an estimated 25 million in 2007 to 35 million in 2011, according to the Commonwealth Fund, a respected research organization.

Full text: As the fierce debate on President Obama's plan for health care reform comes to a head, Americans should be thinking carefully about what happens if Congress fails to enact legislation.
Are they really satisfied with the status quo? And is the status quo really sustainable?
Here are some basic facts Americans need to know as Congress decides whether to approve comprehensive reform or continue with what we have:
HOW REFORM WOULD WORK: Let's be clear, the changes Mr. Obama and Democratic leaders in Congress are proposing are significant. But, despite what the critics charge, this is not a government takeover. And the program is not only fully paid for, it should actually reduce the deficit over the next two decades.
Under the new system, all people would be required to have health insurance or pay a penalty. If you are poor or middle class you would also get significant help through Medicaid coverage or tax credits to pay the premiums.
The legislation would create exchanges on which small businesses and people who buy their own coverage directly from insurers could choose from an array of private plans that would compete for their business. It would also require insurance companies to accept all applicants, even those with a pre-existing condition. And it would make a start at reforming the medical care system to improve quality and lower costs.
46 MILLION AND RISING: If nothing is done, the number of uninsured people -- 46 million in 2008 -- is sure to spike upward as rising medical costs and soaring premiums make policies less affordable and employers continue to drop coverage to save money.
The Congressional Budget Office projects 54 million uninsured people in 2019; the actuary for the federal government's Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services projects 57 million.
It should be no surprise that people without insurance often postpone needed care, and many get much sicker as a result. That is morally unsustainable. It is also fiscally unsustainable for safety net hospitals -- which foist much of the cost on the American taxpayer when the uninsured end up in the emergency room. As the number of uninsured rises, that bill will rise.
The Senate's reform bill would reduce the number of uninsured by an estimated 31 million in 2019. The Republicans' paltry proposals would cut the number by only three million.
BUT I HAVE INSURANCE: While most Americans have insurance, many pay exorbitant rates because they have no bargaining power with insurers.
That includes many of the tens of millions who buy their own insurance -- the unemployed, the self-employed, and those whose employers do not offer insurance. The recently announced plan by Anthem Blue Cross in California to raise annual premiums by 35 to 39 percent for nearly a quarter of its individual subscribers is a chilling harbinger of what is to come if reform fails.
There are another 48 million people who work in relatively small firms that often cannot get the better rates of large-group coverage. All of these groups should be able to get a better deal if they can buy their insurance through new, competitive exchanges.
If current trends continue, the number of underinsured Americans -- those who have coverage too skimpy to pay substantial medical bills or protect them from high out-of-pocket spending -- will also rise from an estimated 25 million in 2007 to 35 million in 2011, according to the Commonwealth Fund, a respected research organization.
That will increase the risk that this group will forgo needed care and will expose many more of them to potential bankruptcy if they cannot pay huge medical bills. Some 72 million adults currently have medical debt or problems paying their bills even though most of them have insurance. Reform would help them by setting minimum standards of coverage and providing subsidies to tens of millions of low- and middle-income people to help pay their premiums.
BUT I LIKE MY INSURANCE: Most Americans get their insurance through large companies, with large group bargaining power. While they complain about premiums and paperwork, most seem satisfied with their coverage.
For them the real fear is what happens if they lose their jobs or decide to change jobs. Will they be shut out of coverage because of a pre-existing condition or forced to pay high rates to buy their own insurance?
For this group, the real advantage of reform is security. If they get laid off, decide to be self-employed or switch to a smaller employer that offers no insurance, they will still be guaranteed coverage -- even if they are a cancer survivor or have heart trouble or any other pre-existing condition. And they will be able to buy insurance on the exchanges.
I'M JUST WORRIED ABOUT COSTS: You should be. The cost of medical care is rising far faster than wages or inflation. And despite all of the talk about reform "bending the curve," no one is yet sure how to do that.
Many reforms that people instinctively believe should cut costs -- computerization of medical records, paying doctors for quality not quantity of services, and prevention programs to promote healthy living and head off costly illnesses -- cannot yet be shown to lower costs.
Pending reform legislation, specifically the Senate bill, would launch an array of pilot projects to test reforms in delivering and paying for care. It would also create a special board to accelerate the adoption of anything that seemed to work. That seems a reasonable way to go and a lot better than standing by as costs continue to spiral out of control. The Republicans' proposals -- including their call to cap malpractice awards -- would make only a small dent in the problem.
WHAT ABOUT THE DEFICIT?: Republican critics of health care reform have done an especially good job of frightening Americans with their talk of bankrupting the Treasury. The truth of the matter is that the pending reform legislation has been designed to generate enough revenue and savings to more than offset the substantial cost of expanding Medicaid and providing subsidies to the middle class.
The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the Senate bill would reduce deficits over the first 10 years by $132 billion and even more in the second decade.
What critics certainly do not talk about is what happens to the deficit if Medicare costs continue their relentless rise. That is something that should keep Americans up at night.
The pending reforms would cut the growth in Medicare spending per beneficiary in half -- from 4 percent a year to 2 percent -- by demanding productivity savings from Medicare providers and cutting unjustified subsidies to the private plans in Medicare.
There is some skepticism that Congress will stick to its guns if health care providers say they cannot survive on the reduced rations. But Congress has stood by most previous Medicare cuts (physicians excepted) and should have its spine stiffened by new pay-go rules requiring that any Medicare increases be offset by other savings or taxes.
If reform is defeated, it seems likely that most of the proposed experiments designed to cut costs -- first within Medicare and then throughout the rest of the health care system -- will die as well. The legislation needs to be passed to establish a structure to force continuing improvement over the years. That is the best chance of restraining soaring medical costs that threaten the solvency of families, businesses and the federal government.

Any change as big as this is bound to cause anxiety. Republicans have happily fanned those fears with talk of "dangerous experiments" on the "best health care system in the world." The fact is that thehealth care system is broken for far too many Americans. And the country cannot afford the status quo.

It would be nice to say that GILBERTO GIL, the Brazilian singer-songwriter, has been exemplary, except that his example isn't easy to follow, even for himself. He's often best performing alone, singing brilliant words in a soft and spirited voice about language, love, philosophy and technology in clear Portuguese diction, putting a heavy samba-swing thumb into his bossa-nova fingerpicking. Even by himself he can overdo it, breaking the spell by having almost too much fun, or overinvesting in Beatles or Bob Marley covers for American audiences. Still, I'll take it: I've seen him generate more joy, and more spookily beautiful, time-freezing moments than most other performers of any kind, without any inflation of persona. (As well as everything else, he's one of the most sensible pop stars you will encounter from a distance.) His latest record, "Bandadois," just released in the United States, is a live career retrospective, mostly solo voice and guitar, and it's excellent. He'll be casting a similarly wide trawl across the last 40 years or so of his work at Nokia Theater, accompanied by only two other musicians: his son, the guitarist Bem Gil, and the cellist Jaques Morelenbaum. Thursday at 8 p.m., 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street,nokiatheatrenyc.com; $50 to $80.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- To bolster the case for a far-reaching overhaul of the health care system, the Obama administration is seizing on a new analysis by Goldman Sachs, the New York investment bank, recommending that investors buy shares in two big insurance companies, the UnitedHealth Group and Cigna, because insurance rates are up sharply and competition is down.
White House officials on Saturday said that the Goldman Sachs analysis would be a "centerpiece" of their closing argument in the push for major health care legislation. The president and Democratic Congressional leaders are hoping to win passage of the legislation before the Easter recess. Republicans remain fiercely opposed to the bill.
The Goldman Sachs analysis shows that while insurers can be aggressive in raising prices, they also walk away from clients because competition in the industry is so weak, the White House said. And officials will point to a finding that rate increases ran as high as 50 percent, with most in "the low- to mid-teens" -- far higher than overall inflation.
The analysis could be a powerful weapon for the White House because it offers evidence that an overhaul of the health care system is needed not only to help cover the millions of uninsured but to prevent soaring health care expenses from undermining the coverage that the majority of Americans already have through employers.
Republicans, however, could also point to the analysis as bolstering their contention that Democrats should be focused more on controlling costs and less on broadly expanding coverage to the uninsured.
The research brief is largely based on a recent conference call with Steve Lewis, an industry expert with Willis, a major insurance broker.
In the call, Mr. Lewis noted that "price competition is down from a year ago" and explained that his clients -- mostly midsize employers seeking to buy health coverage for their employees -- were facing a tough market, in which insurance carriers are increasingly willing to abandon existing customers to improve their profit margins.
"We feel this is the most challenging environment for us and our clients in my 20 years in the business," Mr. Lewis said, according to a transcript included in the Goldman brief. "Not only is price competition down from a year ago," he added, "but trend or (health care) inflation is also up and appears to be rising. The incumbent carriers seem more willing than ever to walk away from existing business resulting in some carrier changes."
The report also indicated that employers are reducing benefit levels, in some cases by adding deductibles for prescription drug coverage in addition to co-payments, and raising other out-of-pocket costs for employees as a way of lowering the cost of insurance without increasing annual premiums and employee contributions to them.
Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services, is expected to discuss the Goldman analysis on two Sunday television talk shows, "Meet the Press" on NBC and "This Week" on ABC.
In his call with Goldman, Mr. Lewis said beneficiaries were feeling the brunt of the changes to existing policies. "Visually to employees, they're fairly significant," he said.
But the report also sounded cautionary notes that the administration will probably not want to highlight.
Asked by Goldman analysts about the effort to pass major health care legislation, Mr. Lewis said many employers experiencing increases in their insurance costs were nonetheless apprehensive about the president's proposal.
"They're very mixed in their reaction, quite candidly consistent with what we're seeing in the polling numbers by party lines," Mr. Lewis said. "I think most people would acknowledge that there's a need for health care reform; employers continue to be very frustrated. So when they look at what the Obama administration and the Democratic majority state as their goals to increase access and lower cost and rail at what may be termed oligopolistic behavior of carriers in certain markets, I think employers really buy in to that message and have much of that frustration and anger at our lack of solutions."
And yet, he said, there is little enthusiastic support from employers for the Democrats' proposals.
"Many of them still view the legislation and the partisanship coming out of Washington as possibly the medicine worse than the disease," he said. "So many employer groups that we're talking to feel like it would be a shame to lose an opportunity to do something with respect to health care reform. But many are starting to feel like maybe nothing is better than something in this current environment."

Full text: A report by the Federal Reserve on Wednesday portrayed an economy that was making hesitant progress but still wrestling with familiar troubles: high unemployment, tepid spending by businesses and consumers, and deterioration in the commercial real estate market.
In its anecdotal survey of economic conditions across the country, the central bank said most regions "continued to expand" at a "modest" pace in late January and most of February. But a series of winter storms along the East Coast constrained activity in several areas, the Fed said.
In total, nine of the central bank's 12 districts reported improvement, mostly in areas like consumer spending and residential real estate. That provided some reassurance that the recovery was on track, despite a recent batch of weak economic data. The halting pace of renewal suggested that the Fed would probably keep interest rates near zero when it met on March 16 to set monetary policy.
James F. O'Sullivan, chief economist for MF Global, said the report indicated that the economy was not on the verge of falling into another downturn, as some people had suggested in recent weeks.
"There's certainly nothing in this report to show a double dip," Mr. O'Sullivan said. "The implication seems to be that outside of weather effects, there is improvement."
Talk of a double-dip recession resurfaced last week after a report showed an unexpected decline in home sales in January. That stoked fears that a rebound for housing, considered crucial to the broader recovery, could falter despite significant government support.
But the Fed's report, known as the beige book, pointed to signs of growth for residential real estate in many regions, which it attributed to a government tax credit of up to $8,000 for home buyers. At the same time, markets like Atlanta, Chicago and New York remained weak or deteriorated, probably because of harsh weather and difficulty securing mortgages, the report said.
The commercial real estate market continued to hinder growth in many areas, the Fed reported. Loans for development remain difficult to obtain, construction is slow and vacancy rates continue to climb.
Demand for loans remains weak in general, with credit standards tight and spending restrained. The report said banks "remained cautious about lending," with the Atlanta region reporting that banks were reluctant to reduce cash reserves, and Dallas saying increased regulation had hampered efforts to increase real estate lending.
Economists remain concerned about the labor market, and say they expect the government's monthly employment snapshot on Friday to be grim, in part because of the snowy weather. The unemployment rate is expected to rise slightly to 9.8 percent, with job losses totaling 55,000, according to a survey of economists by Bloomberg News.
The Fed's report, however, offered some hope that hiring was picking up: the pace of layoffs slowed in most regions, and businesses continued to recall laid-off workers and hire temporary staff members, usually the first signs of renewal. Still, the report concluded, hiring "remained generally soft."
While weak consumer spending is holding back the recovery, areas like manufacturing continue to grow, and there are signs of expansion in other areas. A separate report by the Institute for Supply Management on Wednesday recorded a modest increase in service industry activity in February, when compared with January. Employment in the service sector, which includes industries like retail and transportation, also improved.
A research note by Goldman Sachs said the pickup in hiring reflected an "underlying stabilization in labor market conditions." But the note cautioned that "the impact on the underlying trend is modest" and that job losses for February would probably still be severe.
For now, the Fed seems likely to prolong a period of extraordinarily low interest rates as it tries to pump up the economy. Last week, the Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, reiterated a pledge to keep interest rates low for an "extended period."
But some economists say they believe that low rates may be a precursor to uncontrollable inflation and speculative activity. On Tuesday, Thomas M. Hoenig, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, said near-zero rates were "nonsustainable."

Abstract: Since the Labour government's intense fiscal intervention in 2008 and 2009, yields on British government debt have soared to among the highest in Europe. [...] on a broader scale, which includes the borrowing of households and companies, the overall level of debt in Britain is the second-largest in the world, after Japan's, at 380 percent of the country's gross domestic product, according to a recent report by the consulting company McKinsey.

Full text: As Greece's debt troubles batter the euro, Britain has done its utmost to stay above the fray.
Until now, that is. Suddenly, investors are asking if Britain may soon face its own sovereign debt crisis if the government fails to slash its growing budget deficits quickly enough to escape the contagious fears of financial markets.
The pound fell to $1.4954 on Tuesday, its lowest level against the dollar in nearly 10 months. The yield on 10-year government bonds, known as gilts, slid as investors fretted that Parliament would be too fragmented after a crucial election in May to whip Britain's messy finances back into shape.
The slide in the pound followed a sharper decline on Monday after polls released over the weekend indicated that the opposition Conservatives had lost their clear lead in the election race.
Without a strong political majority to tackle Britain's lumbering fiscal problems, investors could start to make it greatly more expensive for the government to raise funds, setting the stage for a potential double-dip recession, if not worse.
"If you really want a fiscal problem, look at the U.K.," said Mark Schofield, a fixed-income strategist at Citigroup. "In Europe, the average deficit is about 6 percent of G.D.P. and in the U.K. it's 12 percent. It is only just beginning."
Since the Labour government's intense fiscal intervention in 2008 and 2009, yields on British government debt have soared to among the highest in Europe. And on a broader scale, which includes the borrowing of households and companies, the overall level of debt in Britain is the second-largest in the world, after Japan's, at 380 percent of the country's gross domestic product, according to a recent report by the consulting company McKinsey.
In recent weeks, the focus has been on debt scofflaws in Europe like Greece, Portugal and Spain, countries where borrowing costs have shot up in line with their growing deficits as investors demanded higher rates to compensate them for the added risk of lending the governments money.
But the recent plunge in the value of the pound below $1.50 and the gradual move upward of Britain's benchmark 10-year borrowing rate on gilts to above 4 percent suggest that investors are now getting ready to reassess the country's fiscal condition.
Britain is not in the 16-nation euro zone and, unlike Greece and other struggling countries that use the currency, it retains control over its monetary policy. As a result, it has benefited so far from a huge bond-buying program undertaken by the Bank of England -- proportionally, the largest in the world -- that has kept mortgage rates and gilt yields at unusually low levels.
That means the government and its citizens have been able to continue to borrow at interest rates that do not reflect their true financial situation.
Indeed, the increase in private and government debt here contrasts sharply with the deleveraging that has been going on in the United States.
British household debt is now 170 percent of overall annual income, compared with 130 percent in the United States. In an echo of the United States' rush into subprime mortgages with low teaser rates, millions of homeowners in Britain have piled into variable-rate mortgages that are linked to the rock-bottom base rate.
As for the British government, it has been able to finance a budget deficit of 12.5 percent of G.D.P. -- equal to Greece's -- at an interest rate more than two full percentage points lower only because the Bank of England bought the majority of the bonds it issued last year.
"It's not just 'basket cases' like Greece that can be considered candidates for sovereign crises," said Simon White of Variant Perception, a research house in London that caters to hedge funds and wealthy individuals. "Gilts and sterling will continue to come under pressure as scrutiny of the U.K. fiscal situation intensifies."
Adding to this concern is the precarious condition of the British consumer. As interest rates have hit new lows, the popularity of variable-rate loans has grown. At the end of December, 40 percent of new mortgages were tracking the government's base rate.
Despite comments from Mervyn King, the governor of the Bank of England, that he might restart his quantitative easing program in light of current economic weakness, the view among investors is growing that interest rates here will rise further, along with higher inflation and Britain's increased risk profile.
In a speech this year, Andrew Haldane, the executive director of financial stability at the Bank of England, warned about how vulnerable Britain was to a rate increase, pointing out that an increase of one percentage point would cause debt service costs relative to income to double, to 13 percent.
"This is a ticking time bomb," said Nick Hopkinson of Property Portfolio Rescue, a company that assists overleveraged homeowners. "There are over 400,000 people who are in arrears with their mortgage rates the cheapest they have ever been. When rates increase, a lot of people will be tipped over the edge."
As a result, those counting on the British consumer to take up the slack from any scaling back of government borrowing could be in for a shock. Consider Sheridan King, a sales manager who is struggling to pay off his $:32,000 ($47,075) in nonmortgage debt. Far from thinking about going shopping, his first priority is keeping clear of his creditors.
And even though his variable mortgage of about $:100,000 carries a very low rate, interest costs are already chewing up a substantial portion of his pay, and he is deeply worried about the future.
"If rates go up, it will be a very dangerous situation for me," Mr. King said. "It might lead me to consider bankruptcy."
For the time being, at least, the British government faces no such threat.
Despite its borrowing and spending excesses, Britain still maintains a triple-A credit rating and much of its debt is long term. But with 29 percent of British bonds held by foreigners, Britain, like Greece, remains highly vulnerable to the vicissitudes of outside investors.
Since early this year, foreign holdings of British bonds have fallen from 35 percent, a trend that has tracked the pound's decline and contributed to the increase in the yield on its 10-year gilts.
As to which political party he thinks is best placed to handle these challenges, Mr. King takes a skeptical view. "We are just struggling to get by with all this debt," he said. "It's time the government got its house in order."

Full text: CORRECTION: Because of an editing error, an article on the Itineraries pages on Tuesday about the increase in the price of airline tickets because of government fees and taxes misstated the increase in the effective tax rate from 1993 to 2008. A study showed that it increased to 16 percent of the average fare in 2008, from 11 percent in 1993; it did not increase by 11 percent. The article also misstated some figures on the Air Passenger Duty in Britain and the increase to take effect on Nov. 1. The current duty is $:45 in economy class, which will rise to $:60, not $:90, on Nov. 1. The current duty in premium cabins is $:90, not $:60, and that fee will rise to $:120 on Nov. 1.
A recent search for a flight from New York to London turned up an eye-catching fare: $229 each way on several airlines. But nine government taxes and fees added $162 -- more than a quarter of the total ticket price.
Baggage fees may be the cause of more grumbling among passengers, but airlines are trying to draw attention to other charges lurking in the fine print: all the taxes and fees that go toward airport projects, air traffic control, airport security, customs inspections and, in some cases, projects that have nothing to do with flying -- like a French "solidarity tax" on departing passengers that is meant to subsidize purchases of drugs to fight diseases like AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria in developing countries.
Most of these taxes are small individually, but they can add up to a significant share of the price of a ticket, particularly for international flights. While there is some debate about precisely how much ticket taxes have risen in recent years, airline representatives say that governments are increasingly turning to travelers to raise revenue in lean times, and that there is little oversight over how the money is spent.
"We are taxed entirely too much," said David A. Castelveter, a spokesman for the Air Transport Association, an airline trade group that has been battling efforts to add or increase air travel taxes. "We can't have outside organizations reaching out for more when the airline industry is losing billions of dollars. There just has to be some other way to fund these programs people want to introduce."
For travel within the United States, there are four basic taxes on airfares: a passenger ticket tax (7.5 percent of the base fare); a flight segment tax ($3.70 a flight); a passenger facility charge (up to $4.50 a segment); and a federal security fee, also called the Sept. 11 fee ($2.50 a segment). The first two taxes go to the Airport and Airway Trust Fund, which finances the Federal Aviation Administration; passenger facility charges are passed on to airports; and security fees finance the Transportation Security Administration.
Carriers have been lobbying against proposals to increase these fees. One proposal would raise the maximum passenger facility charge that airports can collect to $7 from the current $4.50 per flight segment (still on the table). Another would increase the $2.50 federal security fee (budgeted to go up by $1 a flight in 2012). And a third would raise by 50 cents the $5 animal and plant health inspection fee paid by passengers arriving in the United States (an idea withdrawn last year). Although some of these taxes have risen in the last decade, it is tough to calculate precisely how much the overall tax burden has changed. Airline representatives say taxes and fees account for 25 percent of a domestic ticket price, but according to two professors who have examined millions of ticket records from 1993 to 2008, the effective tax rate has increased only 11 percent to 16 percent of the average domestic fare in that time.
"What's happened is airfares have become cheaper, so proportionately taxes have gone up," said Joakim Karlsson, a professor of aviation policy at Daniel Webster College, who heads the project with Amedeo R. Odoni, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In fact, their analysis found that the total tax on a domestic ticket has been relatively constant since 1993: about $52, adjusted for inflation.
But averages can be misleading because some taxes are a percentage of the base fare, which varies widely, and some are based on the number of flight segments, so passengers with connections pay more than those who fly nonstop.
International travelers are even more likely to feel the tax collectors' pinch, as governments around the world have increased passenger fees to pay for security, airport improvements, customs inspections, tourism promotions and environmental concerns -- though critics say many of these taxes end up in general treasury accounts.
Exhibit A in that regard is Britain's Air Passenger Duty, which went up last year and is scheduled to increase again this fall. This fee varies based on the passenger's class of service and destination; from London to New York, it is $:45 in economy class and $:60 in premium cabins, and will rise to $:90 ($137) and $:120 ($183), respectively, on Nov. 1.
"The Air Passenger Duty is supposedly an environmental tax, but all these taxes go into the treasury," said Brian Pearce, chief economist for the International Air Transport Association, adding that France's solidarity tax -- 1 euro to 40 euros a passenger -- meets a similarly murky end.
"We fear there are going to be more taxes coming down the road as governments look to reduce budget deficits," he said. "It's contagious."
The United States is not immune to the bug. Congress just passed legislation that will charge foreigners, from about three dozen countries, who do not need visas $10 to enter the United States. The money will be used to promote travel to America, an idea that has been criticized abroad.
Kenneth J. Button, a professor of transportation policy at George Mason University, said airlines are vulnerable conduits for these types of taxes because air travel was once considered a luxury, creating the perception that passengers have deep pockets. And putting the fees on airline tickets, he said, makes them easier to collect.
Professor Button, who has done consulting work for the Air Transport Association, said the problem with many of these taxes is that there is little accountability on how the money is used, with airports, the T.S.A. and the F.A.A. all subject to criticism over wasteful or ineffective spending.
"I would argue these taxes are too high simply because there's no incentive for providers to keep their costs low," Professor Button said.
But airport representatives counter that the $4.50 limit on the passenger facility charge has not increased since 2001 and that the money is used to build new runways, improve terminals, reduce noise and other projects -- all of which go through a review process that includes the airlines.
"Ninety-five percent of the requests that go to the F.A.A. are done with the approval of the airlines," said Jane Calderwood, vice president for government and political affairs at the Airports Council International-North America, which supports increasing the cap on the facility charge to $7.50 and indexing it for inflation.
Another objection to the current tax structure, raised by the National Business Travel Association, is that taxes and fees paid on nonrefundable tickets are not always refunded if a ticket is not used.
The group has asked the Government Accountability Office to investigate this issue, arguing that the government and airport authorities should refund the fees if a trip is canceled.
"Who's responsible for getting those taxes back?" said Shane Downey, the business travel association's director for public policy. "There's talk that there's quite a lot of money being lost."

Abstract: With unemployment near 10 percent and projected to remain high for years to come, there is sure to be pressure on the administration, especially from liberals, to nominate Fed governors willing to adhere not just to the central bank's mission of price stability but also its mandate of full employment, a goal that has effectively taken a back seat to inflation fighting over much of the last three decades.

Full text: The vice chairman of the Federal Reserve announced on Monday that he would retire in June, giving President Obama an expanded opportunity to put his stamp on the central bank as it faces a difficult balance between heading off inflation and addressing high levels of unemployment.
The departure of the vice chairman, Donald L. Kohn, a 40-year Fed veteran, means Mr. Obama has three seats to fill on the Fed's seven-member board of governors at a time when the central bank is weighing how aggressively to reverse the easy-money policy it pursued during the financial crisis and recession.
The vacancies are likely to spur debate over the Fed's priorities. With unemployment near 10 percent and projected to remain high for years to come, there is sure to be pressure on the administration, especially from liberals, to nominate Fed governors willing to adhere not just to the central bank's mission of price stability but also its mandate of full employment, a goal that has effectively taken a back seat to inflation fighting over much of the last three decades.
"Any incumbent president wants to see the economy grow," said Alan S. Blinder, a professor of economics at Princeton who was vice chairman of the Fed from 1994 to 1996. "It doesn't matter whether he's a Republican or a Democrat. So I wouldn't be surprised if the Obama administration is looking for someone more dovish on inflation."
Mr. Kohn, an influential cen-trist, was appointed by President George W. Bush, as were the two most recent board members to leave, who tended to emphasize inflation fighting.
Henry W. Chappell Jr., an economist at the University of South Carolina and an authority on the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's major policy-setting arm, predicted that the administration would choose nominees who hold the Keynesian belief that full employment does not necessarily return on its own after a recession and who are "willing to actively respond to prevailing economic conditions like the recession."
Lawrence H. Summers, the chairman of the National Economic Council, and Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary, are expected to exert great influence over the selection process. Both of them tend to be identified with their party's market-oriented center more than with its liberal wing.
A third official, Christina D. Romer, the chairwoman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, has been mentioned as a possible nominee to the Fed. Like the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, she is an academic economist who has written extensively on the Depression. Unlike Mr. Summers, a former Harvard president who had been mentioned as a possible Fed chairman, she is not widely seen as a polarizing figure.
Advocates of making price stability the more dominant of the Fed's mandates say that only through consistent application of aggressive anti-inflation policies can the economy grow to its maximum potential over the long run. Their view has permeated the central bank and the financial markets for years, and deviations from it, real or perceived, are not well received in those quarters, scholars say.
During his tenure at the Fed, Mr. Blinder, who was appointed by President Bill Clinton, found his influence constrained, he has said, in part because of his willingness to raise the question of the balance between inflation and employment growth.
The board of governors has historically tended to be somewhat less hawkish on inflation than the presidents of the 12 regional Fed banks, said Michael D. Bordo, an economist at Rutgers.
"If you have two or three Obama people and they tend to be more dovish, they would push the conversation in a direction of prolonged ease and act as counterbalances to the inflation hawks, who are pushing for exit sooner rather than later," Mr. Bordo said.
The nominees will be coming into the Fed at a particularly delicate time.
"There's going to be a bit of a brouhaha when the tightening comes," he said. "Unemployment will stay high, and yet the recession will have passed. When the Fed starts moving, regardless of all the preparation, there is going to be squawking."
Even before Mr. Kohn's announcement, senior Treasury officials had been vetting prospective candidates for the other vacancies, according to officials involved in the process.
The administration is mindful that the nominees could face a grueling Senate confirmation process, and views the opening in Mr. Kohn's seat as potentially useful in luring a prominent candidate who might otherwise turn down the opportunity, said the officials who asked for anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the search.
Mr. Bernanke won confirmation to a second term in January only after a battle with critics over the Fed's performance in the run-up to the financial crisis.
The officials said that for the vice chairman's job, they were leaning toward someone with more of an academic or policy background, who might not draw the political fire of a nominee with close ties to Wall Street.
Mr. Obama has named one person to the Fed board so far: Daniel K. Tarullo, a law professor who served in the Clinton administration and is an authority on financial regulation.
The other two governors are Kevin M. Warsh, a former executive at Morgan Stanley who has been Mr. Bernanke's liaison to Wall Street, and Elizabeth A. Duke, a former community banker who has focused on the challenges small businesses have had in getting loans. Both were appointed by Mr. Bush.
Mr. Kohn's departure would leave Mr. Bernanke as the only professionally trained economist on the board.
Mr. Kohn, 67, who joined the board in August 2002, and became vice chairman in June 2006, was unusual in the Fed's history, having risen through the staff ranks.
Before joining the board, he was a trusted aide to Alan Greenspan during his long tenure as chairman. Later, at Mr. Bernanke's side throughout the crisis, Mr. Kohn oversaw the stress tests of major financial institutions last year and coordinated the Fed's response to the crisis with that of other central banks.
"The Federal Reserve and the country owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to Don Kohn for his invaluable contributions over 40 years of public service," Mr. Bernanke said.
When Mr. Kohn told Mr. Geithner of his decision, the secretary asked, jokingly, if Mr. Kohn could stay on until unemployment fell to 5 percent.

Abstract: Once unemployment eases, economists believe that consumer spending will come out of the doldrums. [...] gains in spending will be muted, they predict.

Full text: Paychecks are scarcer, consumer confidence is weak and the amount of household debt continues to grow. But even in the face of those pressures, spending by consumers rose modestly in January, the government said on Monday, as Americans reduced their savings rate.
While January was the fourth consecutive month that consumer spending increased, so far the growth has been far short of the surge needed to lead the economy out of its downturn.
Instead, economists are looking for momentum from sectors like manufacturing, which continued to expand in February, according to a report released on Monday by a private group. The report indicated that the fast-paced recovery for manufacturing slowed slightly in February amid fewer orders, though hiring reached its highest level in five years.
With the government set to release its monthly employment snapshot on Friday, the jump in hiring raised hopes for the labor market, where the unemployment rate is 9.7 percent.
Crucial sectors like construction continue to shed jobs. In January, the outlook for builders remained grim: construction spending fell 0.6 percent from December, according to a separate government report on Monday, though home construction gained 1.1 percent, also from December.
Much of the drop came after a pullback in nonresidential building, which fell 1.4 percent as the commercial real estate market faced loan defaults, a dearth of eager financiers and rising vacancy rates.
Once unemployment eases, economists believe that consumer spending will come out of the doldrums. Until then, gains in spending will be muted, they predict.
In January, spending rose 0.5 percent, the Commerce Department said, while incomes rose less than expected, by 0.1 percent. That led to a savings rate of 3.3 percent in January, the lowest since 2008.
At the height of the economic crisis, the savings rate climbed as Americans became nervous about debt and employment prospects. That was a sharp departure from the carefree spending that for decades kept the savings rate low. The rate has since retreated, but economists believe it may rise yet again.
"This, of course, is unsustainable in a world with less debt and fewer jobs," Dan Greenhaus, chief economic strategist for Miller Tabak, wrote in a research note.
Paul Ashworth, senior economist for Capital Economics in Toronto, said the data indicated a "solid, if not spectacular" start to the first quarter of 2010, but he said economists remain concerned about the tepid growth in wages.
"Income needs to be rising faster," Mr. Ashworth said. "This points to fairly lackluster prospects for spending."
A closely watched consumer price index remained flat in January, though it rose 1.4 percent compared with January 2009, the report said. That increase was largely in line with expectations and did not appear to stoke fears about inflation. Other barometers of inflation in recent weeks have been similarly tame.
Manufacturing expanded for a seventh month in February, coming in at 56.5 on the Institute for Supply Management's monthly barometer. Readings above 50 indicate expansion.
Growth in the sector slowed modestly in February, falling from a five-year high of 58.4 in January. Both production and new orders declined, with demand still weak. Unusually bad weather also played a role, economists said.
Employment, however, showed new momentum, reaching the highest level in five years.
"Manufacturers are seemingly willing to hire where they have orders to support higher employment," the report said.
Eleven industries reported growth, from computer makers to manufacturers of machinery. Five industries reported contraction, including wood producers and chemical makers.
As foreign businesses expand, manufacturing will most likely benefit from a surge in exports, said Edward F. McKelvey, senior economist for Goldman Sachs.
"We're not talking about industrial output falling, we're just talking about a slowdown," Mr. McKelvey said.
"The prospects for manufacturing are still pretty good."

Abstract: Mr. Brooks, the vice president for investment management with Blankinship & Foster in Solana Beach, Calif., said anyone under 50 should assume that Medicare will look nothing like it does now and examine private health insurance premiums for guidance as to what may need to be spent on health care in retirement. "What consumers need to know is that no matter how comforting it is to believe a formulaic approach or prepackaged investment product will allow them to put their financial future on autopilot, our current and future financial environment will require advice, diligence, education and responsiveness, which takes into account strategic consideration of geopolitical and economic relationships," as Ryan Darwish, a financial planner in Eugene, Ore., put it to me this week.

Full text: Financial bubbles are a way of life now. They can upend your industry, send your portfolio into spasms and leave you with whiplash. And then, once you've recovered, the next one will hit.
Or so you might think, as a veteran of two gut-wrenching market declines and a housing bubble over the last decade.
There's plenty of reason to expect more surprises, given the number of hedge funds moving large amounts of money quickly around the world and the big banks making their own trades.
Individuals, as always, may be tempted to make their own financial bets, too. Last time, they bought overpriced homes with too much borrowed money. Next time, who knows what the bubble will be? And that's the problem, as it always is. How do you identify the next thing that will pop? Is it China? Or Greece? Or Treasury bonds? It is difficult to predict and make the right defensive (or offensive) moves at the correct moment to save or make money.
Still, if you want to better insulate yourself from bubbles -- however often they may inflate -- there are plenty of things you can do. Your debt levels matter, and you may want to consider a more flexible investment strategy. But perhaps most important, this is a mental exercise that begins and ends with an honest assessment of your long-term goals and how you handle the emotional jolts that come from the bubbles that burst along the way.
FIXED EXPENSES Start with the basics. The less you have to pay toward monthly obligations, the better off you are, and that's especially true at a time of economic disruption. You certainly wouldn't want any bills increasing, so now's a good time to refinance to a fixed-rate mortgage.
Whittle down student loan and credit card debt, too, and pay cash for your car if possible. "Flexibility is priceless in a time of panic," said Lucas Hail, a financial planner with Foster & Motley in Cincinnati.
SELF-RELIANCE Then take a hard look at how much you should rely on promises from the government. Social Security and Medicare may not fit the traditional definition of bubbles, but that hasn't stopped Rick Brooks from advising his financial planning clients to expect less from both programs. "Something that is not sustainable will not continue. It just can't," he said of Medicare.
Mr. Brooks, the vice president for investment management with Blankinship & Foster in Solana Beach, Calif., said anyone under 50 should assume that Medicare will look nothing like it does now and examine private health insurance premiums for guidance as to what may need to be spent on health care in retirement. Meanwhile, the firm advises current retirees to assume a 20 percent cut in Social Security benefits at some point.
Bedda D'Angelo, president of Fiduciary Solutions in Durham, N.C., has an equally stark outlook on long-term employment risk. If there are two adults in the household, your goal should probably be to have two incomes instead of one. "I do believe that unemployment is inevitable," she said, adding that people who think they are going to retire at 65 should save for retirement as if they will be forced out of the work force in their mid-50s.
PORTFOLIO TACTICS Perhaps you did what you thought you were supposed to during the last decade. You got religion and stopped trading stocks. Then, you split your assets among various low-cost mutual funds and added money regularly. And the results weren't quite what you hoped.
Tempted to make big bets on emerging markets or short Treasury bills? You've landed in the middle of the debate between those who favor a more passive asset allocation and those who prefer something called tactical allocation.
The first camp sets up a practical mix of investments, according to a target level of risk, and then readjusts back to that mix every year or so.
They frown on the hubris of the tactical practitioners. To make a tactical approach work, they note, you need to know what the right signals will be to buy and sell everything from stocks to gold, during every future market cycle. Then, these tacticians need to have the discipline to act each and every time. This is extraordinarily hard.
The tacticians, however, believe they have no choice. "What consumers need to know is that no matter how comforting it is to believe a formulaic approach or prepackaged investment product will allow them to put their financial future on autopilot, our current and future financial environment will require advice, diligence, education and responsiveness, which takes into account strategic consideration of geopolitical and economic relationships," as Ryan Darwish, a financial planner in Eugene, Ore., put it to me this week.
Mr. Darwish scoffed at the notion of mere bubbles and said he thought that more fundamental and far-reaching shifts were under way, like the transfer of economic power from the United States to China and other nations.
A growing number of financial planners are embracing a middle, more measured approach: If diversification across stocks, bonds and other asset classes has proved to be a good thing in most investing environments, why not diversification around investment approaches?
"I am not a financial genius, but the geniuses are even worse off because they're anchored on one philosophy," said David O'Brien, a financial planner in Midlothian, Va. So he and a growing number of his peers have added some strategies to their baseline portfolios aimed at losing less during bubbles while still gaining in better times. "We're not trying to shoot for the moon," he added.
These tactics can include managed futures, absolute return funds, merger arbitrage and other approaches that will get their own column someday.
The embrace of all this even led one investment professional I spoke with this week to express the ultimate sacrilege: It really is different this time.
Thomas C. Meyer of Meyer Capital Group in Marlton, N.J., noted that many of these alternative strategies were not even available in mutual-fund form three to four years ago. So that's different. He's now putting 30 percent of his clients' equity portfolios into such investments.
The big change, however, is that the baby boomer money is getting older. People are further along in their careers than they were during the market crash in 1987, and they can't rely on pensions as so many more near retirees could in the 1980s (while shrugging off stock market volatility). And the boomers don't have as much time to make up lost ground, especially if they're already retired.
"Losing less means a lot right now," Mr. Meyer said. "So we want to suck volatility out where we can."
MATTER OF THE MIND But can you live with less volatility -- and the permanent end of occasional portfoliowide returns in the teens or higher? Markets run on greed and fear; bubbles expand and deflate thanks to outsize versions of each. One of the few things you can predict about bubbles is that they will test your conviction on where you sit along the fear-greed continuum.
And once they pop, you'll know a bit more about how your mind works than you did before.
This last downturn was severe enough that about 10 percent of Steven A. Weydert's clients realized that they had overestimated their own risk tolerance. "Ideally, with an asset allocation, you never want to look back and say you're sorry," said Mr. Weydert of Bowyer, Weydert Wealth Planning Partners in Park Ridge, Ill.
So rather than trying to predict the number and type of bubbles, it may make more sense to look inward when trying to predict the future. Bob Goldman, a financial planner in Sausalito, Calif., said that clients often looked at him blanklywhen he asked them what it was they imagined for themselves in the future. Sometimes, they need to go home and figure out what sort of life it is that they're saving for -- and how much (or little) it might cost.
"People come in and talk about how we all know that inflation is going to explode next year," Mr. Goldman said. "Well, we don't all know that. We don't know anything. But we can know something about our own lives, and there is a person we can talk to about that. A person in the mirror."

Full text: Just a year after laying off millions of factory workers, China is facing an increasingly acute labor shortage.
As American workers struggle with near double-digit unemployment, unskilled factory workers here in China's industrial heartland are being offered signing bonuses.
Factory wages have risen as much as 20 percent in recent months.
Telemarketers are turning away potential customers because recruiters have fully booked them to cold-call people and offer them jobs.
Some manufacturers, already weeks behind schedule because they can't find enough workers, are closing down production lines and considering raising prices. Such increases would most likely drive up the prices American consumers pay for all sorts of Chinese-made goods.
Rising wages could also lead to greater inflation in China. In the past, inflation has sown social unrest.
The immediate cause of the shortage is that millions of migrant workers who traveled home for the long lunar New Year earlier this month are not returning to the coast. Thanks to a half-trillion-dollar government stimulus program, jobs are being created in the interior.
But many economists say the recent global downturn also obscured a longer-term trend: China has drained its once vast reserves of unemployed workers in rural areas and is running out of fresh laborers for its factories.
Since China does not release reliable, timely statistics on employment, wages are considered the best barometer of labor shortages. And temp agencies here in Guangzhou raised their rate for factory workers this week to $1.17 an hour, from 95 cents an hour before the new year holiday.
The rate was 80 cents an hour two years ago, before the global financial crisis temporarily depressed wages and demand.
The dearth of returning migrants set off a desperate scramble this week to recruit the workers who did step off long-haul buses and trains returning from the interior.
At a government-run employment center in downtown Guangzhou, employers seeking workers outnumbered job-hunters Thursday afternoon.
Outside, Liang Huoqiao, a 22-year-old plastics worker, joined a small group of men and women studying a 40-foot-wide list of companies seeking workers.
"You can walk into any factory and get a job," he said.
The official China Daily newspaper said on Thursday that surveys of employers showed that one in 12 migrant workers was not expected to return here to Guangdong Province. Cities farther north along China's coast are also running low on labor; Wenzhou alone posted a shortage of up to one million workers.
Guangdong provincial officials announced on Wednesday that they were considering increasing the minimum wage, which varies by city and ranges from $113 to $146 a month.
Higher wages could ease labor shortages by prompting factories to reduce their work forces.
But many factories already pay well above the minimum wage. They are wary of further pay increases because it is not certain they can pass the increased costs on to their customers -- in particular, strapped importers in the United States and the European Union.
Rising wages suggest the re-emergence of a worker shortage that was becoming evident before the financial crisis. A government survey three years ago of 2,749 villages in 17 provinces found that in 74 percent of them, there was no one left behind who was fit to go work in city factories -- the labor pool was dry.
Mass layoffs in late 2008 and early 2009 because of the global financial crisis temporarily masked the developing shortage of industrial workers. But two powerful trends were still working to reduce the supply of young people headed for factories.
For one, the Chinese government has rapidly expanded postsecondary education. Universities and other institutions of higher learning enrolled 6.4 million new students last year, compared to 5.7 million in 2007 and just 2.2 million in 2000.
At the same time, China's birth rate has been sliding steadily ever since the introduction of the "one child" policy in 1977.
Labor shortages have returned quickly in recent weeks as these long-term trends have collided with a recovery in overseas demand for Chinese goods.
Far more jobs are available these days in China's interior. Government projects like rail and highway construction have absorbed millions of workers, particularly after Beijing allocated nearly $600 billion to economic stimulus spending in 2009 and 2010. Consumer spending is also rising briskly; auto sales more than doubled last month from a year before, and this has created many jobs in retailing, restaurants, hotels and other inland businesses.
Even before the holiday, companies were struggling to find the employees needed to keep assembly lines running.
At many factories, white-collar managers and engineers were forced to spend time on assembly lines to meet deadlines before the lunar New Year, because laborers were in such short supply. The managers often struggled with the tedious but intricate tasks required to make everything from toys to DVD players
"People working in the office, like me, have been asked to help on the factory floor," said Sky Niu, the sales manager at the Hengjia Electronics Company in Dongguan. "Of course, we can only help on the simpler tasks, such as packing."
The labor shortage is not benefiting workers just through higher wages. Personnel managers here say they are also abandoning the informal tradition of not hiring anyone over 35 -- they say they are now hiring workers up to 40 years old, and sometimes older, despite concerns about whether they can keep up week after week with the rapid pace of Chinese assembly lines.
It remains to be seen if Chinese factories will learn from their hiring difficulties now and be less quick to lay off workers during the next global downturn.
The current system "is not stable, it's not healthy," said Han Dongfang, the director of the China Labor Bulletin, a Hong Kong-based group that advocates collective bargaining.
Though the wage boost increases the prospect of inflation, it may have another more salutary aspect. The Obama administration has been pushing China to let the renminbi rise against the dollar, which would erode some of China's formidable advantage in export markets. Rising wages in China have the same effect -- while also giving Chinese families more spending power.
Letting wages rise benefits workers, said Jing Ulrich, the chairwoman of China equities and commodities at J. P. Morgan. Letting the currency rise benefits currency speculators, she said.
Mr. Liang, the 22-year-old plastics worker, said that he expected his pay to double in the next five years and added that he already had set his priorities.
"For sure, I want to buy a car," he said. "Car first, then maybe marriage later."

Full text: What is the most outrageous section of American tax law?
"People get a deduction for punitive damages paid in a lawsuit," was the response from Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, the top Republican on the Budget Committee. "I always thought that was pretty absurd. It is significantly less punitive if you get a deduction."
Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat and member of the Finance Committee, pointed to a nontax item, a subsidy to oil companies for research in deep-sea drilling. "Some of the biggest, most profitable companies in the world are getting government subsidies," he said.
The two senators introduced a bill this week, which they modestly called the Bipartisan Tax Fairness and Simplification Act of 2010. It may be significant less for its details than for its mere existence. Until passage of a modest jobs bill this week, cooperation across the aisle had not been a feature of the current Senate, as Senator Evan Bayh, Democrat of Indiana, complained in announcing he had had enough and wanted out.
Moreover, a study of the Gregg-Wyden tax bill provides a road map to issues that Congress will have to grapple with if it tries to do something more than a quick patch of tax laws.
There is urgency to passing a tax bill for two reasons. One is that the government is starving for money, running deficits that would have been unimaginable a few years ago. That reason, sad to say, seems to have little resonance on Capitol Hill.
The other is a legacy of some of the least responsible tax legislation ever passed by a Congress, the 2001 and 2003 tax acts. To make 10-year cost estimates look better, and to use a Senate rule making the measures easier to pass, those tax bills had sunset provisions: at the stroke of midnight on Dec. 31, 2010, many current sections of tax law will self-destruct.
Without legislative action, tax rates will rise across the board in 2011. The estate tax, abolished this year, will come back with a vengeance.
It has been almost a quarter-century since Washington produced the Tax Reform Act of 1986, with a Republican president (Ronald Reagan) and a Democratic senator (Bill Bradley) taking the lead. That bill got rid of all kinds of loopholes and special-interest provisions, and then used the extra revenue to lower rates.
The next year, Congress began to clutter up the tax code.
Senator Wyden and Senator Gregg have in mind a repeat of the Reagan-Bradley experience. They propose cutting the corporate tax rate to 24 percent, from 35 percent, and the top individual rate to 35 percent. To pay for that, all kinds of special sections go away.
Those who can take advantage of lots of special provisions would lose even if rates came down. Others would benefit.
For those of us who don't have tax lobbyists, the list of things they want to do away with is somewhere between fascinating and outrageous. There is the "inventory property sales source rule exemption," the "deferral of active financing income" and the "special tax rate for nuclear decommissioning reserve fund." They want to "disallow a portion of the LIFO (last-in, first-out) inventory method for large integrated oil companies." And they want punitive damages to be treated the same as fines after convictions -- as nondeductible expenses for companies that are forced to pay them.
They also want to do things that will hit home for some readers of this column, like taxing fringe benefits and no longer excluding income earned abroad by American citizens. They want to end the deferral of tax on income from United States savings bonds, and to get rid of the deduction for moving expenses.
The bill reflects preferences of the two senators. Mr. Gregg is worried about capital formation and about reducing tax reasons for capital to flow to areas that might be less productive. Mr. Wyden wants to preserve progressivity and to assure that the tax breaks that remain are available to all.
One result is a change that keeps preferential tax rates for capital gains, but adjusts the computations so that people in the two lower tax brackets they propose -- 15 and 25 percent -- actually pay lower rates than do those in the upper bracket. Another is a change in the break for municipal bond interest that assures a middle-income taxpayer would get the same benefit, in dollars, as would a taxpayer in a higher bracket.
One interesting proposal is to reduce the tax incentive for companies to borrow money by reducing the deduction for interest payments. That reduction would be based on the inflation rate, and is too complicated to explain here, but the important point to Mr. Gregg is that it could encourage companies to raise equity rather than debt.
To be sure, there are the same kinds of tax preferences that they criticize. Small businesses -- those with revenue under $1 million a year -- are to be allowed to deduct from their income the costs of any equipment and inventory they purchase.
And sometimes they simply punt. They point to billions in "direct payments and indirect subsidies to businesses each year," and call them "corporate welfare."
But rather than specify which ones should be eliminated, they would direct the Congressional Budget Office to identify the least productive subsidies so that Congress could consider reducing them.
It would be really refreshing if other legislators and the Obama administration joined in seeking to find compromises that would simplify the tax law and rip out various subsidies and preferences that have been inserted over the years.
Perhaps there could be a new tradition of cleaning up the code every 25 years.
But the reality is likely to be far different. Republicans will accuse Democrats of wanting to tax and spend. Democrats will accuse Republicans of favoring the rich. We will get, in Mr. Wyden's words, "another partisan debate about fiddling with a broken tax system."
At the last minute, some temporary measure no one likes will be passed, accomplishing nothing in the way of real change.
If you have found the health care debate edifying, particularly the parts about death panels and illegal immigrants, you'll really love the tax squabble.
The existence of this bill is a signal that some legislators want something much better. Let's hope they get it.

Abstract: Moving from monetary to regulatory matters, Mr. Bernanke said he supported greater transparency for the special lending programs the Fed created in 2008 to prop up securities firms, money market funds, and issuers of commercial paper and student, auto and credit card loans.

Full text: Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, told Congress on Wednesday that the central bank did not intend to start raising short-term interest rates anytime soon, saying the economic recovery would remain halting for many more months.
In presenting the Fed's semiannual monetary report to Congress, he did not waver from his recent statements on monetary policy. And the reassurance helped lift the stock market, even as a new report showed a drop in sales of new homes.
It was Mr. Bernanke's first testimony since a grueling confirmation process ended last month, when the Senate gave him a second term as chairman by the narrowest margin in the Fed's history.
In what appeared to be a deliberate response to the criticisms leveled at the Fed, Mr. Bernanke announced support for two measures to improve oversight of the extraordinary lending programs the Fed started in 2008.
In one of the moves toward openness, Mr. Bernanke said the Fed would back legislation requiring the eventual release of the names of borrowers that used the programs.
He also said the Fed had undertaken "an intensive self-examination" of its regulatory duties, after years in which it had failed to curb some of the most excessive risk-taking by the banks it supervises.
Members of the House Financial Services Committee seemed satisfied with Mr. Bernanke's message and tone. The hearing was much more placid than the raucous Senate confirmation debate, in which lawmakers assailed Mr. Bernanke for failing to foresee and head off the financial crisis and for aiding the Treasury's bailout of Wall Street.
The twice-a-year report is intended to draw focus to the central bank's dual mandate: promoting maximum employment while keeping the inflation rate low and steady.
But many of the questions directed at Mr. Bernanke focused on the federal debt and deficits, or the difficulties small companies have had in obtaining loans and the bleak state of the commercial real estate market, areas over which he has little authority.
In contrast to his predecessor, Alan Greenspan, who frequently offered his thoughts on fiscal policy, Mr. Bernanke tried to deflect efforts to get him to endorse either additional fiscal stimulus or prompt deficit reduction.
"Obviously, unemployment is the biggest problem we have," he told the committee's chairman, Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts. "But there are difficult trade-offs that you have to make."
Mr. Bernanke also agreed with Spencer T. Bachus of Alabama, the senior Republican on the committee, that huge long-term deficits could not be sustained. "In order to maintain a stable ratio of debt-to-G.D.P., you need to have a deficit that's 2 1/2, 3 percent at the most," he said referring to the gross domestic product.
The current structural deficit, which government agencies estimate at from 4 percent to 7 percent of G.D.P., is unsustainable, Mr. Bernanke said.
He added: "It's not necessarily just a long-term issue, because it is possible that bond markets will become worried about the sustainability, and we may find ourselves facing higher interest rates even today."
Three hours passed without any serious effort by lawmakers to get Mr. Bernanke to specify when the Fed might start to tighten credit. Nor did they question the Fed's decision last week to raise the discount rate on loans it charges to banks, a largely technical but widely noticed step to normalize lending.
"Although the federal funds rate is likely to remain exceptionally low for an extended period, as the expansion matures, the Federal Reserve will at some point need to begin to tighten monetary conditions to prevent the development of inflationary pressures," Mr. Bernanke said in testimony that accompanied the 53-page monetary report.
Jeffrey A. Frankel, an economist at the Harvard Kennedy School, said the appearance had a reassuring effect. "What he said probably allayed concerns that some segments of the market might have had about premature tightening of monetary policy," he said.
Catherine L. Mann of the International Business School at Brandeis University said the biggest challenge the Fed faces is navigating the next financial bubble. "Whereas they want to keep interest rates low to stimulate Main Street, the reality is that low interest rates are mostly stimulating Wall Street," she said.
Moving from monetary to regulatory matters, Mr. Bernanke said he supported greater transparency for the special lending programs the Fed created in 2008 to prop up securities firms, money market funds, and issuers of commercial paper and student, auto and credit card loans.
"While the emergency credit and liquidity facilities were important tools for implementing monetary policy during the crisis, we understand that the unusual nature of those facilities creates a special obligation to assure the Congress and the public of the integrity of their operations," he said.
He said the Fed would disclose the identities of the borrowers after a "lag that is sufficiently long" to avoid hurting the companies, undermining market confidence or discouraging borrowers.
Mr. Bernanke also said he would support audits by the Government Accountability Office of how the lending programs were conducted.
But he defended the longstanding practice of not disclosing which banks borrow from the central bank's discount window.
"The reason is that banks will only come to the discount window in a period of crisis or panic, and if they believe that their names will be revealed, that would indeed, in fact, intensify the crisis or panic," Mr. Bernanke said.
During the financial crisis, the Fed helped arrange the sale of the investment bank Bear Stearns and the rescues of the American International Group and Citigroup. Those interventions are already subject to G.A.O. audits.

Full text: F.D.I.C. Mission:
Slay the Zombies
Killing zombies isn't just a job for horror movie heroines. It's also the primary task of Sheila C. Bair, the head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
Ms. Bair's challenge has increased as the number of so-called problem banks on the F.D.I.C.'s watch list has spiked. But there is little reason the F.D.I.C. can't exterminate the banking industry's living dead.
On Tuesday, the agency reported that 702 problem institutions were on its watch list as of the end of 2009. Those institutions had combined assets of $403 billion, or the equivalent of 3 percent of the nation's economic output. While those figures may seem scary, the F.D.I.C. also managed to collect $46 billion in new cash from banks, bringing its total cash and liquid securities to $66 billion.
That may not seem to be much of a cushion. After all, the average estimated loss rate for bank failures since 2007 -- excluding the collapse of the giant Washington Mutual -- is 23 percent of assets.
Assuming no truly gigantic banks founder -- that is, the ones considered "too big to fail" -- the F.D.I.C.'s kitty is currently around $27 billion shy of being able absorb all its sick banks.
Not all of the banks on the F.D.I.C.'s list will be seized. Many banks work their way through difficulties, raise private capital or are taken over by healthier rivals. And the F.D.I.C. can levy another special assessment on banks before asking the taxpayer to pitch in. Add it all up, and the F.D.I.C. has no financial excuse to avoid cleaning up the mess.
Yet the pace of bank seizures -- up by half so far this year -- hasn't kept pace with the growth of the problem bank list. The worry is that zombie banks will suck up deposits and hoard capital that might otherwise be lent out by healthy institutions.
The winter storms that closed down Washington this month complicated travel plans for F.D.I.C. staff members. But the main lesson from the savings-and-loan debacle of the 1980s and 1990s was that delays in closing insolvent banks increase resolution costs for the F.D.I.C. and, ultimately, taxpayers.
With spring around the corner, Ms. Bair needs to set her sights on a big zombie hunting trip.
Japan's Recovery
The conventional wisdom is that Japan has never really recovered from the bursting of the stock market and real estate bubbles in 1990. That view is basically wrong.
Sure, prices have not recovered. The stock market is still almost 75 percent below its peak, and land prices are down 60 percent. After two decades of nearly stable consumer prices, the Japanese government is once again badgering the central bank to do something to create a bit of inflation.
This appeal, like so many before it, is likely to end inconclusively. Japan will continue with its longstanding pattern of near-stable prices, slow growth and gargantuan government deficits. But the economy is basically in pretty good shape.
While the economic growth -- about 1 percent a year since 1990 -- seems unimpressive, the number of people below retirement age has been shrinking by 0.4 percent a year. Annual growth in per capita gross domestic product in the United States over the same period was 1.4 percent -- not much different from Japan's.
Other economic indicators suggest Japan is managing pretty well. Even midrecession, car sales are only 20 percent less than at the 1990 peak.
Housing starts are down 50 percent, but the population was rising then and is declining now. The 5 percent unemployment rate is modest by Western standards. And the 1.4 percent yield on the 10-year government bond hardly seems a vote of no confidence in the government or the country.
The country's financial burden -- gross government debt at 200 percent of G.D.P. -- could yet prove too much to bear for a rapidly aging and steadily declining Japanese population. But for now, Japan should be more a sign of hope than gloom for the United States, Britain and euro zone countries that have endured a severe financial collapse.
Japan had advantages in dealing with its financial collapse. It has a high savings rate, a big trade surplus and a powerful tradition of cultural and political unity. Few Western countries have all of these. Most also face almost Japanese-style demographic challenges. They will be fortunate to do as well as Japan.

Full text: Volatility returned to Wall Street on Monday, ending a four-day winning streak for stocks, as worries over the energy sector overshadowed hopes that banks would continue to bring in generous profits.
With little on the economic calendar, the attention turned to Washington and the political struggles underpinning the debate over monetary policy.
Investors spent Monday trying to divine what the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben S. Bernanke, would say when he testified before a House committee on Wednesday. With unemployment high and many parts of the economy still depending on government support, investors were betting that Mr. Bernanke would reiterate his pledge to keep interest rates near zero in the immediate future.
"It certainly seems like the tone of what he says about the recovery is going to be a lot better," said Thomas J. Lee, chief United States equity strategist at JPMorgan Chase. "But the private sector is not self-sustaining just yet, and it is too early for the Fed to engage in a broad policy normalization."
That consensus was enough to spur a rally for banking stocks, with JPMorgan Chase rising 2 percent, Wells Fargo climbing 2.34 percent and Citigroup gaining 1.17 percent. Low interest rates have translated into extraordinary profits for banks, allowing them to borrow cheaply and lend at higher rates.
Adding to the financial sector's gains, shares of Bank of America rose 2 percent after a federal judge approved a $150 million settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
But the winning day for banks was undermined by a drop in commodity prices, which sent shares of energy companies down. Natural gas prices fell about 2.5 percent, and copper declined 1.6 percent. In response, Chevron tumbled nearly 1.5 percent and Exxon Mobil fell 0.7 percent.
The Dow Jones industrial average ended down 18.97 points, or 0.18 percent, at 10,383.38. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 1.16 points, or 0.1 percent, closing at 1,108.01. The Nasdaq fell 1.84 points, or 0.08 percent, to 2,242.03.
Analysts noted that trading was light on Monday, heightening the volatility on Wall Street. They said investors were recalibrating their portfolios before a spate of data later this week on sectors including the housing market and retail sales.
"There's a lot of different views on where the market is headed," said Dan A. Faretta, senior market strategist for LaSalle Futures Group. "Right now the market is kind of taking a breather."
Shares of drug makers stumbled after President Obamaannounced details of his $950 billion health care proposal. The plan would reduce the deficit by $100 billion over the next 10 years, but investors remained concerned that it could diminish the profitability of health care companies.
Shares of the drug maker Merck fell about 1 percent.
Last week, the Federal Reserve took its first small step toward tightening policy by raising the rate it charges on short-term loans to banks.
Several earnings reports on Monday provided some signs that the recovery was on track.
Lowe's, the home improvement chain, said its profit had grown 27 percent in the fourth quarter and that revenue was strong. Shares of the company slipped 0.3 percent, however, as investors were concerned by the company's financial forecast.
The Treasury's 10-year note fell 6/32, to 98 19/32. The yield rose to 3.8 percent, from 3.77 percent late Friday.
Following are the results of Monday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills and 30-year Treasury inflation-protected securities:

Abstract: Large federal deficits have helped to buffer the economy from the financial crisis and the recession, but if they persist into the recovery, they could push interest rates up and absorb private savings that would be otherwise used in productive investments, Ms. Yellen said.

Full text: The United States faces the prospect of a jobless recovery, with painfully slow employment growth and the economy not operating at its full potential until 2013, a top Federal Reserve official said Monday.
The official, Janet L. Yellen, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said that a sharp increase in worker productivity was "here to stay."
She predicted that unemployment, now at 9.7 percent, would fall to 9.25 percent by the end of the year and around 8 percent by the end of 2011. And she described the current inflation rate as "undesirably low."
The Fed has repeatedly said that it would not start to tighten credit for at least several months. When the time comes, Ms. Yellen said, the Fed will probably start by raising the interest rate it pays on bank reserves. Only after that will it gradually sell the Treasury securities and mortgage-related assets it bought to hold down long-term interest rates and support the recovery.
Markets are acutely interested in the timing and sequence of the Fed's withdrawal of monetary stimulus, particularly after the Fed raised the rate it charges banks for short-term loans last week, a largely technical move but a crucial step toward the normalization of lending.
Ms. Yellen, who was chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers during the Clinton administration and is one of the best-known economists among the Fed's leaders, spoke at the University of San Diego. In hearings on Wednesday and Thursday, the Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, is to present the central bank's semiannual report on monetary policy to Congress.
Ms. Yellen offered a fairly grim outlook. Although gross domestic product rose at an annual rate of 5.7 percent in the last quarter -- the best gain in six years -- the improvement was attributable to businesses reducing their inventories, rather than growth in sales, making a "V-shaped recovery" unlikely, she said.
She estimated that the economy would grow about 3.5 percent this year and 4.5 percent next year. Although the Fed lowered its benchmark interest rate to near zero in December 2008 and made big loans and asset purchases, Ms. Yellen said, "all in all, monetary policy can't give the same kick to the economy that it delivered in past recoveries."
Ms. Yellen also tried to explain why Okun's Law, which describes the relationship between unemployment and changes in output, "let us down big time in 2009." Given the lag between potential and actual output, unemployment should be lower than it is.
Ms. Yellen said she believed that the culprit was an increase in business efficiency and labor productivity.
"Strapped by tight credit and plummeting sales, businesses have overhauled the way they manage supply chains, inventory, production practices and staffing," she said. "Stores don't order merchandise unless they think they can sell it right away. Manufacturers and builders don't produce unless they have buyers lined up. My business contacts describe this as a paradigm shift and they believe it's permanent."
Ms. Yellen believes that "economic slack and downward pressure on wages and prices are pushing inflation down."
Large federal deficits have helped to buffer the economy from the financial crisis and the recession, but if they persist into the recovery, they could push interest rates up and absorb private savings that would be otherwise used in productive investments, Ms. Yellen said.
Still, she said there was "no evidence that government deficits cause high inflation in advanced economies with independent central banks, like the Fed." If anything, she said, Japan -- which has run big deficits for years -- has "suffered from persistent deflation, not inflation."
She called the underutilization in the American economy "the most worrisome challenge for price stability over the next few years."
One of the problems cited by Ms. Yellen was the bleak state of the commercial real estate market, where mortgage-backed defaults and losses have been rising.
On Monday, the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, wrote to Mr. Bernanke and other federal regulators, asking them to report on efforts to stabilize that market.

Global Crisis Leads I.M.F. Experts to Rethink Long-Held Ideas

Abstract: It argued that governments that had relatively lower debts to begin with had more flexibility to respond to the crisis.

Full text: The International Monetary Fund has long preached the virtues of keeping inflation low and allowing money to flow freely across international boundaries. But two recent research papers by economists at the fund have questioned the soundness of that advice, arguing that slightly higher inflation and restrictions on capital flows can sometimes help buffer countries from financial turmoil.
One paper has received particular attention for suggesting that central banks should set their target inflation rate much higher -- at 4 percent, rather than the 2 percent that is the most widely held standard. As aggregate demand fell across the world in 2008, central banks, including the Federal Reserve, lowered short-term interest rates to nearly zero, where they have largely remained.
While the two papers do not represent a formal shift in the fund's positions, they suggest that the I.M.F. is re-examining some of its long-established orthodoxies as part of its response to the global economic crisis that began in 2007.
The significant drop in the volatility of output and inflation since the mid-1980s -- a period known as the Great Moderation -- helped lull "macroeconomists and policy makers alike in the belief that we knew how to conduct macroeconomic policy," the fund's chief economist, Olivier Blanchard, wrote in one of the papers. "The crisis clearly forces us to question that assessment."
That paper examines how, in hindsight, higher rates would have helped in the current crisis.
"Higher average inflation, and thus higher nominal interest rates to start with, would have made it possible to cut interest rates more, thereby probably reducing the drop in output and the deterioration of fiscal positions," Mr. Blanchard and two other authors wrote in the paper, released Feb. 12.
The other paper, released Friday, said that in the aftermath of the crisis, officials were "reconsidering the view that unfettered capital flows are a fundamentally benign phenomenon."
"Concerns that foreign investors may be subject to herd behavior, and suffer from excessive optimism, have grown stronger; and even when flows are fundamentally sound, it is recognized that they may contribute to collateral damage, including bubbles and asset booms and busts," the fund's deputy director of research, Jonathan D. Ostry, wrote, along with five other authors.
Both papers contained important caveats.
Mr. Blanchard's said that fiscal policy -- like decisions to tax, spend and borrow -- had been as important in responding to the crisis as monetary policy, or control of the supply of credit. It argued that governments that had relatively lower debts to begin with had more flexibility to respond to the crisis.
And it asserted that regulatory measures -- like requiring higher capital and liquidity ratios, lower loan-to-value ratios for home mortgages, and increased margin requirements for stock purchases -- would be more effective than higher inflation targets in curbing excessive risk-taking.
Similarly, Mr. Ostry's report said capital controls would be effective only if the flows "are likely to be transitory" and the economy is already operating near potential, with reserves at an adequate level and an exchange rate that is not undervalued.
The report also found that "the jury is still out" on whether capital controls had worked in practice. Evidence from countries like Chile and Colombia, it said, suggests that controls have been more effective at curbing exchange-rate pressures and the risk associated with capital inflows than in reducing the net influx of money.
In separate interviews, three former I.M.F. chief economists said the recommendations were significant but raised questions about the feasibility of carrying them out in today's situation.
Raghuram G. Rajan, of the Booth School of Business at the University of Chicago, said the I.M.F.'s suggestion for allowing higher inflation might not be well received. "With bond markets worried that governments may inflate their way out of their debt obligations, this is probably not a good time for central banks to start debating their inflation targets," he said.
Mr. Rajan said he was concerned that the nuances regarding capital controls would be overlooked. "The pressure within emerging markets to set up capital controls, with many countries not meeting the careful conditions laid out by the fund's paper, will increase," he predicted.
Kenneth S. Rogoff of Harvard noted that he had urged that the Fed and the European Central Bank consider slightly higher inflation targets after the 2001 recession in the United States. But he added, "Having spent the past two decades convincing the public that 2 percent inflation was magical, it might be both difficult and confusing for central banks to suddenly announce they have changed their minds."
He said Mr. Ostry's report was only the latest step in the fund's reassessment of its "dogma on capital controls" that began with the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s. "Today, it is patently obvious that the U.S. and Europe's near-zero-policy interest rates are fueling a surge of international capital into Asia and Latin America that will end in tears if not properly managed."
Simon Johnson, of the Sloan School of Management at M.I.T., said it would be "a very hard sell" to persuade central banks to raise their inflation targets "just because the financial sector is badly run and hard to reform."
But he praised the emphasis on regulation. "The I.M.F. is trying to redefine what is and what is not responsible financial policy after the crisis," he said. "They are commendably aware of the need for greater regulation and the ways to synchronize that around the world."

Full text: President Obama will propose on Monday giving the federal government new power to block excessive rate increases by health insurance companies, as he rolls out comprehensive legislation to revamp the nation's health care system, White House officials said Sunday.
The president's legislation aims to bridge differences between the bills adopted by the House and Senate late last year, and to frame his debate with Republicans over health policy at a televised meeting on Thursday.
By focusing on the effort to tighten regulation of insurance costs, a new element not included in either the House or Senate bills, Mr. Obama is seizing on outrage over recent premium increases of up to 39 percent announced by Anthem Blue Cross of California and moving to portray the Democrats' health overhaul as a way to protect Americans from profiteering insurers.
Congressional Republicans have long denounced the Democrats' legislation as a "government takeover" of health care. And while they are likely to resist any expansion of federal authority over existing state regulators, they will face a tough balancing act at the meeting with the president to avoid appearing as if they are willing to allow steep premium increases like those by Anthem.
Republican leaders had not formally accepted the president's invitation to the meeting. But the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, said on Sunday that he would attend. "I intend to be there, and my members will be there and ready to participate," Mr. McConnell said on Fox News.
The president's new provision also seemed to offer Republicans an opening for a new line of criticism -- that Mr. Obama and Democrats are anticipating the possibility of hefty price increases for health insurance even after their big legislation is adopted.
Mr. McConnell said the president, in proposing a new version of the Democrats' legislation, seemed to prejudging the outcome of the session. "If they are going to lay out the plan they want to pass four days in advance," he said on Fox, "What are we discussing on Thursday?"
The White House has held details of Mr. Obama's bill extremely tight, leaving even top Democrats in Congress anxiously awaiting the text to be released Monday. But administration officials said it would incorporate legislation proposed last week by Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, in response to the Anthem increases. Officials said it would "help make sure that people are not unfairly subject to arbitrary premium hikes."
Anthem, California's largest for-profit insurer, has announced premium increases for nearly 700,000 customers, citing the soaring costs of medical care and the effects of a weak economy in which many younger and healthier people are dropping insurance. But the increases, far outpacing the rate of medical inflation, led to outrage among officials in Sacramento and Washington.
The Obama administration has sought to portray the situation as a warning of what could happen to many more Americans if Congress does not act to overhaul the health system.
The president's bill would grant the federal health and human services secretary new authority to review, and to block, premium increases by private insurers, potentially superseding state insurance regulators. The bill would create a new Health Insurance Rate Authority, made up of health industry experts that would issue an annual report setting the parameters for reasonable rate increases based on conditions in the market.
Officials said they envisioned the provision taking effect immediately after the health care bill is signed into law.
The legislation would call on the secretary of health and human services to work with state regulators to develop an annual review of rate increases, and if increases are deemed "unjustified" the secretary or the state could block the increase, order the insurer to change it, or even issue a rebate to beneficiaries.
The new rate board would be composed of seven members, including consumer representatives, an insurance industry representative, a physician and other experts like health economists and actuaries, the White House said. The board's annual report would offer guidance to the public and states on whether rate increases should be approved.
But the focus on rate increases is also spotlighting questions about whether the Democrats' plans do enough to control rising health costs. Anthem and other insurers say they do not.
And it is unclear if the new powers or the rate board would have much long-term impact. The Democrats' legislation ultimately seeks to sharply curtail the existing individual insurance market in which companies like Anthem Blue Cross now sell their policies. Instead, such policies would be heavily regulated by the federal government and sold through new insurance exchanges, where consumers could compare prices and benefits packages and choose policies that best fit their needs.
The president's bill, like the measures adopted by the House and Senate, is expected to require most Americans to obtain insurance, and would provide new federal subsidies to help moderate-income people afford to buy private coverage.
And though Americans have heard officials in both parties talk for nearly a year about "President Obama's health care plan," the legislation unveiled on Monday will actually be the first comprehensive proposal put forward by the White House.
Senator Feinstein, in an interview, pointed to the $12.2 billion in profits reaped by the five biggest private insurers in 2009. "When you look at the profits in '09, up 56 percent over the year before," she said, "you begin to understand that something is going on that is not in the interests of the American people."
Ms. Feinstein said that only 25 states allowed their insurance commissioners to regulate rates and that California was not one of them. "For the life of me, I am not sure why not," she said. "The time has come for the secretary of health and human services to step into this."
Mr. Obama has portrayed Thursday's meeting as a chance to break the partisan gridlock that has stalled any progress on health care this year. He has called on the Republicans to come forward with proposals of their own.
But absent some dramatic turnabout by Republicans, Democratic leaders will have only one other possible path -- approving changes to the Senate bill by attaching them to an expedited budget measure, precluding a Republican filibuster in the Senate. Even many Democratic lawmakers are skeptical that the complex health care legislation can be moved through using that parliamentary maneuver.
And many have been reluctant to say they would support a compromise measure without first knowing what was in it.
Leaders of the National Governors Association meeting in Washington on Sunday expressed frustration that they had been largely shut out of negotiations over the future of the health care system, even though they would be responsible for carrying out many of the changes envisioned by federal officials. They said they wanted more of a voice in shaping those changes.
"It's important that governors be at the table and bring our perspective to the debate," said Gov. Jim Douglas of Vermont, a Republican who is chairman of the National Governors Association.
Mr. Douglas said governors were deeply involved in discussions with Congress and Mr. Obama on the economic stimulus law adopted early last year. But he said, "We have not had that kind of relationship in the current debate" on health care.
Gov. Phil Bredesen of Tennessee, a Democrat, said: "Governors have something unique to contribute. Washington, D.C., is full of think tanks, theoreticians and advocacy groups. Governors are the ones whose feet are on the ground. We have a sense of what will work and what won't work. Our perspective is not the only one. But we can bring some practicality to this discussion."
Mr. Douglas, Mr. Bredesen and two other governors -- Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, a Democrat, and Michael Rounds of South Dakota, a Republican -- spoke at a news conference at the winter meeting of the governors association. They and other governors plan to convey their concerns to Mr. Obama at a White House meeting on Monday.

Full text: AFTER last year's stunning rally in global stock markets, many investors thought they knew what to expect in 2010. Among their bets were that the worst of the credit crisis was over, that the global economy would continue to expand and that the dollar would remain weak as economies abroad were expected to grow faster than that of the United States.
What's more, if anything was to derail the new bull market, it was the likelihood that government efforts to jump-start the global economy would fan the flames of inflation.
Now move to the present. Less than two months into the new year, many of these assumptions are already under fire. For starters, economic turmoil overseas, spearheaded by a crippling debt crisis in Greece, is leading to new doubts about the global recovery. Even if Europe doesn't fall into a double-dip recession, some economists fear that the region won't fully recover until 2012.
As a result, investors have been selling euro-denominated investments and buying the dollar, raising its value by around 6 percent against the euro so far this year.
The surprising events prove a couple of important points, market strategists say.
First, they highlight the risks investors face whenever a strong consensus forms around any market call. "There's an old saying that goes, 'if everyone is forecasting something, then you know it won't come true,"' said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at Standard & Poor's.
More often than not, he said, it's the thing that investors don't see coming that ends up unsettling portfolios. After all, at the end of 2009, how many people worried that the Greek debt crisis would stall the new bull?
More important, the issues that are scaring the market today "show that our assumptions about the financial crisis being over are premature," said Charles de Vaulx, a portfolio manager at International Value Advisers.
At the core of the recent global credit crisis, he noted, was the dangerous amount of risk that individuals and corporations assumed by borrowing to spend and invest. And, he said, "the way this crisis has been addressed around the world has been through a huge amount of fiscal stimulus."
In other words, to keep the economy afloat while the private sector repaired its balance sheet, governments worldwide picked up the spending slack. "But the result of all those actions is that now, suddenly, the focus is on the creditworthiness of governments themselves," he added.
That means the fiscal actions around the globe didn't end the credit crisis. They merely shifted the focus to another segment of the economy: the public sector.
Does this mean that the rally -- and the recovery -- are over? Not necessarily, market watchers say. But at the least, it's a sign the market may have gotten ahead of the underlying economy.
Ernest M. Ankrim, senior markets adviser at Russell Investments in Tacoma, Wash., said that after stocks soared nearly 70 percent between March 9 and Dec. 31, as measured by the total return of the S.& P. 500, investors were probably betting on an economic rebound that would be as good as the downturn was bad.
But Mr. Ankrim noted that the markets might have miscalculated in one crucial area. After suffering through recent troubles in the housing, equity and job markets, he said, consumers aren't likely to go back immediately to their free-spending ways.
That, in turn, could slow the economic recovery both at home and abroad.
This would seem a strong argument to bet against the economies of the United States and Europe and to bet on the much more rapid growth of emerging markets.
But not so fast. Just as the developed economies surprised investors negatively early this year, they could just as easily surprise on the upside later in 2010.
Consider the euro. While its decline reveals real problems in Europe, it could also create a tailwind for some of its markets, said Michele Gambera, chief economist at Ibbotson Associates.
He noted that while Greece faces major budget problems, economies in Germany, France and the Netherlands are in far better shape. Yet the fall in the euro caused by Greece's problems could lift the exports of those healthier countries, whose products would thus be priced more competitively, he said.
INVESTORS who are thinking of betting on the emerging markets should also take note of another surprise this year.
Although emerging economies are growing must faster than the developed world -- growth in China, for instance, is projected at nearly 10 percent this year, versus 2.6 percent in the United States and 1 percent in Europe -- many emerging-market stocks have fared just as poorly as Western European shares lately.
Chinese stocks are down about 7 percent this year, on average, about the same as European equities. The average Brazilian stock has lost more than 6 percent.
But that's what often happens in markets where investors are prepared for one scenario, but where another one unfolds. "If you don't expect something to happen and you haven't prepared for it," says Mr. Stovall of S.& P., "that's when panic often sets in."

Reassured About Inflation, Investors Push Shares Higher

Abstract: The report suggested that inflation was not an immediate threat, easing some pressure on Fed policy makers to raise its benchmark interest rate -- the federal funds rate -- in the near future.

Full text: Stocks were slightly higher Friday as investors saw signs that inflation remained subdued in the United States. That eased anxiety over the Federal Reserve's decision to increase an important interest rate.
Stocks wandered for most of the day but managed a fourth consecutive day of gains, finishing one of the best weeks for the major indexes since November.
Financial markets began the day down sharply after the Fed increased the rate on loans made directly to banks, heightening concern that the era of cheap money was drawing to a close.
As the session went on, shares turned positive, largely because of a report that showed only a slight increase in consumer prices in January. The report suggested that inflation was not an immediate threat, easing some pressure on Fed policy makers to raise its benchmark interest rate -- the federal funds rate -- in the near future.
But the markets lost some of their momentum in the afternoon as large investment firms reduced their exposure to risk before the beginning of a new week, analysts said.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 0.09 percent, or 9.45 points, at 10,402.35. The wider Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 0.22 percent, or 2.42 points, to 1,109.17, led by gains in shares of utilities companies and financial firms. The Nasdaq gained 0.1 percent, or 2.16 points, to 2,243.87.
For the week, the Dow was up 2.92 percent, the S.& P. 500 rose 3.04 percent, and the Nasdaq increased 2.69 percent.
Investors were watching the Fed's interest-rate balancing act because of its implications for future profits. While an increase in interest rates suggests the recovery is on track, it also portends that more expensive lending could take a toll on earnings. Banks in particular stand to suffer, after using a period of low rates to reap huge profits.
"The Fed is taking the training wheels off the financial system," said Alan M. Gayle, senior investment strategist for RidgeWorth Investments. "The market is concerned that this is another step in the direction of an eventual tightening." Analysts expect fear of higher interest to continue to hang over the markets.
As stocks gained, the dollar continued its recent rise against the euro, trading at around $1.36. Crude oil prices rose nearly 1 percent to $79.78 a barrel, and gold climbed modestly to $1,121 an ounce.
The Fed's move to raise rates, announced after the close of trading on Thursday, was seen as the first significant step to withdrawing some of the stimulus measures deployed in late 2008 in response to an escalating global financial crisis.
Interest rates fell slightly on Friday. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 7/32, to 98 25/32, and the yield fell to 3.77 percent, from 3.80 percent.
Major stock markets in Europe fluctuated as investors wondered whether the Fed's decision would prompt the European Central Bank to raise its benchmark rate from its record low, 1 percent. The FTSE 100 in London closed up 0.62 percent, the CAC-40 in Paris rose 0.58 percent, and the DAX in Frankfurt was 0.73 percent higher.

Abstract: With an unemployment rate of nearly 10 percent and midterm elections coming up, American officials are aware that pushing China to raise the value of its currency, the renminbi, and allowing American companies greater access to some Chinese markets could be important political victories for Mr. Obama and his party.

Full text: When President Obamamet with the Dalai Lama in the White House on Thursday, he was following a tradition that all recent American presidents had dutifully honored.
Yet, to some Chinese Mr. Obama's support of the Dalai Lama represents something more troubling and disrespectful. The meeting, while low-profile, and the routine announcement last month of American arms sales to Taiwan, were taken as the latest signs that despite China's rapid ascent, the American government still refused to compromise on issues that China considered sacrosanct: matters of sovereignty and territorial integrity.
On Friday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry called in Jon M. Huntsman Jr., the American ambassador here, to lecture him on the Dalai Lama, the exiled spiritual leader of the Tibetans, whom China considers a separatist.
"At this time, China and the U.S. cannot find any agreement on strategic issues," said Yan Xuetong, director of the Institute of International Studies at Tsinghua University.
Few American officials would disagree. The rift in United States-China relations has arisen in part because the two countries have completely different items at the top of their foreign policy agendas and are talking past each other, American officials say.
They say that China emphasizes sovereignty issues while refusing to give any weight to the Obama administration's two top priorities in the relationship: containing Iran's nuclear ambitions and rebalancing currencies and trade. The Americans have also highlighted issues of Internet censorship and security.
"There's not a lot of overlap in the Venn diagram," an American official involved in China policy said on the condition of anonymity, following diplomatic protocol. "What's really the most worrisome is the degree to which we have that disconnect."
Those tensions are likely to worsen in coming months as domestic pressures in each country push the governments to assert their agendas more boldly, and as China's confidence in its economic system continues to grow.
On the American side, a struggling economy is forcing the Obama administration to make currency valuation and market liberalization top priorities. With an unemployment rate of nearly 10 percent and midterm elections coming up, American officials are aware that pushing China to raise the value of its currency, the renminbi, and allowing American companies greater access to some Chinese markets could be important political victories for Mr. Obama and his party.
"We've got to look at the risk of a more populist American public and the U.S. Congress deciding that China is the reason our economy isn't growing enough," the American official said.
Economists say the renminbi is undervalued by 25 to 40 percent, a wider gap than at any other time since 2005, when, under pressure from the Bush administration, China decided to allow the renminbi to float in a narrow band against the dollar and other currencies. The renminbi appreciated 21 percent, but has not moved at all since July 2008. This month, Ma Zhaoxu, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, rejected an unusually public call by Mr. Obama for China to revalue its currency, saying that "the value of the renminbi is getting to a reasonable and balanced level."
The problem for the Americans is that job creation is also a priority for the Chinese government, because the legitimacy of the Communist Party is based largely on economic growth. A year ago, when the global recession resulted in a severe slump in exports, Chinese officials said 20 million migrant workers lost their jobs. The export industry in China is only now starting to recover, and the low value of the renminbi is crucial for Chinese companies selling goods abroad.
"With economic and trade issues, we're in for a very difficult year," said Kenneth G. Lieberthal, a scholar at the Brookings Institution who worked on China policy in the Clinton administration. "I see Chinese protectionism growing on the ground as well as on the U.S. side, with midterm elections coming up."
But some economists say China is likely to let the renminbi rise by about 5 percent to help stave off inflation, a growing concern among Chinese policy makers. Historically, high inflation has stirred unrest in China.
Economists say the Obama administration and European allies can press China to revalue the renminbi by threatening to impose more tariffs on manufactured goods. Last fall, the American government imposed tariffs on Chinese tires and steel pipes. European officials have privately said that China's increasingly unyielding stance on issues like human rights has made it politically easy for European governments to toughen up on tariffs.
Michael Pettis, a professor of finance at Peking University, said he expected the Chinese government to raise the value of the renminbi by a few percent by the spring. But raising the value too quickly could lead to widespread bankruptcies among manufacturers here, he said.
"China must recognize the pressures on the other countries, but the other countries need to recognize that China will not be able to adjust quickly," he said.
Iran's nuclear programis the other top priority for the White House. China says it does not support economic sanctions against Tehran, despite widespread suspicions that Iran wants to create nuclear weapons. So the question for the Obama administration is how to ensure that China will not block a United Nations Security Council vote on sanctions. Iran is a major supplier of oil to China, and China balks at siding with Western nations against Muslim governments, partly because its officials are sensitive to ethnic unrest by Uighur Muslims in western China.
"China just doesn't see Iran as part of its core national interest, except for that fact that Iran collects a lot of natural resources for them," the American official involved in China policy said.
But Russia, which had previously opposed sanctions, has been showing signs of reaching the limits of its tolerance with Iran, and the White House hopes that China will give in if Russia supports sanctions. Despite China's newfound confidence, the American official said, China still does not want to be seen as a lone spoiler on major global issues.
"Eventually," he said, "the Chinese will cave once they've gone as far as they can go without looking like they're the ones blocking all this."

Full text: IN the first decade of the 21st century, world exports boomed and then fell sharply. And there was a restructuring of the major manufacturing nations of the world.
In 1999, the top five exporting countries were the traditional industrial powers -- the United States, Germany, Japan, France and Britain. Combined, they accounted for 43 percent of the exports reported by 40 large countries.
As can be seen in the accompanying charts, a new order has emerged. China went from the ninth-largest exporter in 1999 to the largest in 2009. Germany, which passed the United States to become the largest exporter from 2003 to 2008, wound up in second place as the United States fell to third. Britain tumbled to No. 10, from No. 5.
All told, the share of exports of the Big Five of 1999 fell to 34 percent in 2009. That loss of nine percentage points was matched by a similar gain for China, India and South Korea, with most of the gain going to China.
Measured in dollars, Chinese exports rose at a compound annual rate of 20 percent through the decade.
China even did better than most in 2009, when the combined exports of the 40 large countries fell by 21 percent. China's dropped by 16 percent that year.
Among the top 12 shown in the graphic, the largest declines in 2009 -- all of 25 percent or more -- were recorded by Japan, Italy and Canada. The United States suffered an 18 percent drop.
The 40 countries included in the tally are the largest ones for which figures are available through at least November. Among them, all but Belgium and Spain have reported December numbers. Their figures were estimated based on trends from September to November.
Countries that report figures either annually or quarterly were not included. The largest exporters thus left out are mostly oil exporters, including Saudi Arabia. The figures cover exports of goods, not services.
During the decade, American exports rose at a compound rate of a little more than 4 percent. That was far behind China and other emerging Asian exporters like South Korea (10 percent) and India (16 percent). But it was faster than Britain, Canada or Japan.
Those figures are in nominal dollars, not adjusted for inflation. The gains would be different if measured in other currencies, like the euro or yen, but the order would be the same.
There are indications of strong rebounds in exports as the world economy begins to recover. In December, American exports were 21 percent above where they had been in the same month of 2008, compared with China's 18 percent rise. China's exports were still much larger than those of the United States.
Only a few countries, mostly in Asia, have reported January figures, but some of them showed explosive gains from the depressed levels of early 2009. China's exports rose 21 percent, but that paled in comparison to the 47 percent gain reported by South Korea and the 77 percent increase in shipments from Taiwan.
A significant part of those gains may reflect the need to fill depleted inventories, rather than a surge in consumer demand. It remains to be seen whether world trade can return to the sustained high levels shown from 2003 through 2008, when exports of the 40 countries rose by more than 10 percent every year.

Full text: Consumer prices were flat in January, the Labor Department said Friday, easing concern that the Federal Reserve will have to raise interest rates to ward off inflation soon.
While the Fed has taken a small step toward scaling back emergency measures that supported the economy by raising an interest rate for short-term loans to banks, the data reinforced a sense that more severe tightening was still a way off.
The report suggested that inflation was largely in check despite a period of extraordinarily low interest rates. That should ease some of the pressure on Fed policy makers as they consider when to raise the federal funds rate, a benchmark for market rates.
The cost of living in the United States remained steady in January, the Department of Labor said, with the price of a variety of goods -- including medical expenses and cigarettes -- increasing 0.2 percent. A closely watched measure that excludes volatile food and fuel prices, the cost of living underscored the downward trend: it fell 0.1 percent in January, the first decrease since the recession in 1982.
"Despite the extraordinary fiscal and monetary stimulus injected into the economy, many prices are still stagnant or declining," Dan Greenhaus, chief economic strategist for Miller Tabak, wrote Friday in a research note. "The pricing situation still remains fragile."
Despite rumblings on the possibility of deflation -- a three-month gauge of prices fell to zero last month -- economists generally expected the upward momentum to continue. Prices have risen 2.6 percent in the last year.
"Even though the economy is expanding again, the threat of deflation has not passed," Paul Ashworth, an economist for Capital Economics in Toronto, wrote in a research note. He said that high vacancy rates and a flood of foreclosed homes would continue to depress housing costs.
As it battled the global financial crisis, the Fed printed more than $1 trillion in new money and kept interest rates near zero, prompting criticism that it was setting the stage for rampant inflation.
But prices remain subdued. That could change as banks begin to lend money they hold in reserves, but the Fed hopes tighter monetary policy and efforts to drain some reserves will counteract any inflation.
On Thursday, the central bank moved toward withdrawing its efforts to prop up the economy, announcing that it would raise the interest rate it charges on short-term loans to banks, known as the discount rate, by a quarter of a percentage point. Analysts do not expect the federal funds rate to rise for at least six months.
The Labor Department attributed much of the increase in consumer prices, measured by its Consumer Price Index, to rising energy costs -- primarily gasoline, fuel oil and natural gas. A decrease in the price of rent, new cars and airline tickets helped offset rising energy prices.
Economists said the results indicated that businesses were keeping prices low to try to attract price-conscious customers.
"People are very much price-sensitive, they are still paying down their debts," said Anna Piretti, senior economist for BNP Paribas. "That is going to be the theme for some time. Prospects for employment are not looking very bright."
A report on jobless filings on Thursday rekindled worries that the labor market would be slow to rebound. First-time claims last week were much higher than expected -- 473,000, up 31,000 from the previous week.
The data on consumer prices beat Wall Street forecasts, and helped calm some of the nervousness that emerged on Wall Street after the Fed said it would raise the discount rate.
On Thursday, the government offered a similar portrait of inflation in its report on producer prices, which rose 1.4 percent in January. Higher prices might be in the pipeline, especially for metals, food and energy products.
It is unclear whether businesses can afford to pass rising costs to consumers. If they do not, that may worsen their financial health and prolong unemployment.
"If producers see their profits being hurt they will be more reluctant to hire," Ms. Piretti said. "It's a circle."

Abstract: The retailer's same-store sales in the United States dropped 2 percent in the quarter ending in January compared with a year earlier, the company said Thursday, largely because of price declines on food items and consumer electronics. Thomas Hoenig, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, who dissented at the last Federal Open Market Committee meeting when interest rates were kept near zero, said this week that runaway prices were not outside the realm of possibility.

Full text: Fears of deflation in the United States have abated, replaced by worries that rampant inflation could take hold. But the experience of Wal-Mart Stores, the world's largest retailer, is a reminder that, for now, the battle on the ground is still against corrosive falling prices, not rising ones.
The retailer's same-store sales in the United States dropped 2 percent in the quarter ending in January compared with a year earlier, the company said Thursday, largely because of price declines on food items and consumer electronics. This isn't a new story for Wal-Mart. Deflation has dogged it for a year or more.
So much for America's Main Street. Closer to the bailed-out halls of high finance, thoughts are turning to the dangers of inflation. The broader economy escaped the feared deflationary spiral thanks in large part to the trillions of taxpayer dollars thrown at the financial system. But some fear that the stimulus and government borrowing could eventually feed hyperinflation.
Thomas Hoenig, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, who dissented at the last Federal Open Market Committee meeting when interest rates were kept near zero, said this week that runaway prices were not outside the realm of possibility.
That doesn't have to be inconsistent with what Wal-Mart had to say. The company expects price declines to ease in the coming quarters, a trend that by should eventually flip into price rises. But the company's report is a reminder that its customers are still suffering from high unemployment and a depressed housing market. With consumers in poor shape and new jobs scarce, one significant driver of inflation, consumer spending, is missing.
That's not to say inflation won't pick up. Global stimulus efforts are raising the prices of commodities, for instance. And Wal-Mart's customers will eventually have more to spend. But if the retailer can be trusted as a consumer bellwether, serious inflationary pressure could be further off than the hawks expect.
The Dividend Case
Verizon Wireless has thus far used its prodigious cash flow to acquire rivals like Alltel and pay down debt. Its parent, Verizon, has encouraged that, rather than share a dividend payout from its mobile subsidiary with its minority partner Vodafone. But this policy can't last much longer, because Verizon will soon need cash.
Verizon Wireless could pay out a substantial dividend to Verizon, a 55 percent owner, and to Vodafone, which owns the remaining 45 percent. The wireless unit is set to generate about $12 billion of free cash flow this year. But by limiting its subsidiary's payouts, Verizon raises the pressure on Vodafone to sell it more of the unit, something Verizon's chief executive, Ivan Seidenberg, said in January he was open to if the price was right.
Verizon can't afford to use this lever for too much longer. It had about $2 billion of cash at the end of 2009. The company will receive another $5 billion in the coming months as a loan extended to the wireless arm is repaid. But this pile is already largely spent. Verizon's landline operations may be burning almost $700 million a year by 2011, according to Barclays. Meanwhile Verizon needs $5 billion if it is to maintain the dividend it pays out to shareholders.
This year isn't a problem, but next year things could get tougher. Even with capital expenditures due to decline by $2 billion, it's not clear the group will generate enough cash to continue shareholder payouts at that level in 2011.
Of course, Verizon could take on more debt. Unfortunately, though, borrowing at the parent while a subsidiary piles up cash earning relatively little interest isn't efficient, and Verizon Wireless is on track to pay down its own $22 billion of debt in about two years.
Verizon could also raise funds by selling traditional telephone assets. Yet prices for those assets continue to fall. Selling chunks of its network may not bolster cash flow much, either. Frontier Communications has, for example, promised Verizon $3.3 billion for landlines in 14 states, but that may come in the form of debt, not upfront cash.
Put it all together, and before long something has to give at Verizon. The most likely concession will be for Verizon Wireless to start paying a dividend.

Full text: Wall Street rode a three-day winning streak on Thursday, but an unexpected move after the close to raise a crucial interest rate sent a wave of pessimism through the market.
Stock futures fell after the Federal Reservesaid it would raise the rate it charges banks on emergency loans, signaling a lower open for Friday. The Dow Jones industrial average futures were down 76 points around 7 p.m.
"The Fed can talk all day about how the discount rate hike is technical and not a policy move, but the market sees it as a shot across the bow," Christopher S. Rupkey, chief financial economist at the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ in New York, told Reuters.
Still, the positive economic news from earlier in the day helped counteract an increase in unemployment claims in investors' minds.
On Thursday, the government offered a broad -- and mostly encouraging -- snapshot of the economy's health: manufacturing in the Philadelphia region picked up and wholesale prices rose, but not by enough to sound alarms on inflation.
At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.81 percent, or 83.66 points, to 10,392.90. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index increased 0.66 percent, or 7.24 points, to 1,106.75. The Nasdaq climbed 0.69 percent, or 15.42 points, to 2,241.71.
A surge in price for industrial metals -- copper climbed nearly 2 percent -- helped lead a rally for shares of materials companies.
Oil prices rose 1.73 to $79.06 a barrel in New York trading. Copper prices also rose sharply.
A report released Thursday recorded the sixth month of gains for manufacturing in the Philadelphia region, raising hopes that factories were on track to help drive a recovery.
As the government continues to spend billions in economic stimulus, and interest rates remain near zero, some investors worry that inflation could imperil the recovery. Despite data on Thursday showing a 1.4 percent increase in producer prices in January, economists said inflation remained largely subdued.
The biggest concern for many investors is the labor market. The economy continues to lose jobs, and the unemployment rate was 9.7 percent last month. And on Thursday the government reported an unexpectedly large increase in the number of people filing new unemployment claims last week.
In addition, sales at Wal-Mart's stores in the United States fell in the fourth quarter, sending the company's shares down more than 1 percent. The retailer, a national bellwether, also said the economy "remains challenging for many of our customers."
The challenge on Wall Street is finding the momentum for a rally. European and Asian markets have shot up in recent days, but American investors have reacted warily because trading has been light.
"We're a little reluctant to trust the recent bounce," said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist for Key Private Bank.
"The recovery is ongoing, but it's at a slower pace than past recoveries, and that opens the possibility to more general disappointment," he said.
Economic data has been bright lately, but not sufficient to erase worries about the health of the jobs market and the chronically troubled housing market.
There is still talk that after an energetic rally for stocks last year -- the major indexes soared more than 20 percent -- the market may be in store for a steeper downturn as it adjusts to the reality of a halting recovery.
The major indexes remain about 4 percent off their highs on Jan. 19. After flirting with 8 percent losses this month, stocks have regained ground.
The Treasury's 10-year note rose 17/32, to 98 18/32. The yield fell to 3.80 percent, from 3.73 percent late Wednesday.

Full text: With interest rates at low levels, inflation hawks have warned that price increases may be around the corner. While a government report on Thursday heightened those concerns, economists said inflation still remained largely in check.
Producer prices in the United States increased 1.4 percent in January -- outpacing expectations of a 0.8 percent jump -- mostly because of an increase in gasoline prices. Excluding volatile food and energy costs, the increase was 0.3 percent, compared with a forecast of 0.1 percent.
Even the small fluctuations in price levels were enough to prompt talk of creeping inflation. While economists emphasized the need to remain vigilant about prices, they agreed that inflation was not an immediate concern.
In addition, the Federal Reserve took its first step to normalizing lending on Thursday by raising the interest rate it charges on emergency loans to banks.
"We're going to be generally grinding toward higher inflation," said Conrad F. DeQuadros, an economist for RDQ Economics. "Will it hit problematic levels in 2010? I don't think so. But it does have the potential for uncomfortably high inflation readings down the road."
Economists attributed much of the rise in wholesale prices, measured by the government's Producer Price Index, to an 11.5 percent jump in gasoline prices, the result of rising fuel costs.
The unexpected increase in nonfood and energy prices was partly caused by a 1.9 increase in the cost of light trucks. Those prices tend to be volatile, economists said.
Much of the focus lately has been on the Federal Reserve's plans to withdraw measures used to combat the financial crisis. But economists do not expect policy makers to begin raising short-term interest rates until there are firmer signs of improvement in the jobs market. Unemployment remains at 9.7 percent, and the economy is still shedding jobs.
On Thursday, a separate report showed the number of people filing first-time unemployment claims last week was much higher than expected -- 473,000, up 31,000 from the previous week. That increase rekindled worries that the labor market would be slow to bounce back, even though it has gradually improved in recent months.
"It's all about uncertainties facing businesses: uncertainty about the strength of the recovery, uncertainty about tax liability, uncertainty about health care reform," Mr. DeQuadros said. "The labor market is improving, but we're still not at levels suggesting that we are creating jobs."
Economists also were debating the effect of recent East Coast snowstorms on the weekly jobless report. Some said it probably meant fewer people were able to file unemployment claims because government offices were closed; others said it probably had a limited effect because many people file claims via the Internet.
Still, analysts said the government's monthly employment report, scheduled to be released the first week of next month, would probably be weaker than expected because of the weather. The government surveyed employers last week about the state of their businesses, asking how many employees had worked that week and how many hours they had contributed. Those numbers were probably uncharacteristically low in some areas because of the snow.

Abstract: Members of the Federal Reserve's policy-making arm generally concurred that the central bank should eventually tighten monetary policy, but they disagreed on how to raise interest rates and reduce the balance sheet, according to minutes of last month's meeting. The minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee's meeting, released Wednesday, showed agreement that the Fed should use a fairly new tool -- the interest rate on excess reserves, currently 0.25 percent -- when it begins to tighten monetary policy. [...] despite a dissent from one member, the committee reaffirmed that the sluggish economy meant interest rates would stay low "for an extended period."

Full text: Members of the Federal Reserve's policy-making arm generally concurred that the central bank should eventually tighten monetary policy, but they disagreed on how to raise interest rates and reduce the balance sheet, according to minutes of last month's meeting.
The Fed's balance sheet, which exceeds $2.2 trillion, ballooned as the central bank bought mortgage-backed securities and Treasury securities starting in 2008, as part of its effort to hold down long-term interest rates and prop up the economy.
As a result of the asset purchases, banks hold $1.1 trillion in reserves at the Fed. Policy makers were concerned that if the banks started to make loans from those reserves too quickly, it could lead to inflation.
The minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee's meeting, released Wednesday, showed agreement that the Fed should use a fairly new tool -- the interest rate on excess reserves, currently 0.25 percent -- when it begins to tighten monetary policy. And despite a dissent from one member, the committee reaffirmed that the sluggish economy meant interest rates would stay low "for an extended period."
The committee did not have a uniform opinion, however, about the timing and sequence of the Fed's tightening. Most members thought the Fed should reduce reserves long before raising interest rates. Some argued that the Fed should drain reserves only after it had decided to raise rates, while a few said the actions should happen simultaneously.
There was also talk of increasing the discount rate -- the rate at which the Fed directly lends to banks -- as the central bank seeks to normalize lending.
The Fed also fine-tuned its economic forecast, saying unemployment would be in the range of 9.5 to 9.7 percent in the last part of 2010, a shift from its projection of 9.3 to 9.7 percent in November (the unemployment rate is now 9.7 percent). The committee also indicated that prices might rise slightly faster than expected.
As the Fed looks to drain reserves, the committee discussed several possible tools, notably repurchase agreements, in which the Fed sells assets with an agreement to buy them back later at a higher price, and term deposits, similar to certificates of deposit, for bank reserves.
Members of the committee debated two measures -- redeeming Fed-held securities as they mature or are prepaid, without reinvesting the proceeds, and selling the securities it holds before they mature -- that would reduce bank reserves and shrink the balance sheet. But officials have signaled that those measures will have to be taken cautiously.
Most committee members said gradually selling assets "could be helpful" in shrinking the balance sheet, but some members were concerned that the actions "could cause market disruptions and have adverse implications for the economic recovery."
Several committee members said the Fed should begin asset sales soon and carry out the process over several years. Others suggested adjusting the pace of sales depending on the strength of the recovery.
James F. O'Sullivan, chief economist for MF Global, said the Fed appeared to be waiting for clearer signals that unemployment was subsiding before taking action.
"As you start to see clearer improvement in the labor market, it won't be long before they start shrinking the monetary base and raising interest rates," he said.
A separate report released Wednesday offered signs of stability in the housing sector. The Commerce Department said builders broke ground on homes at an annual rate of 591,000 in January, up 2.8 percent from a month earlier. But a 4.9 percent decline in the number of building permits and a 12.4 percent drop in the pace of completed houses illustrated the fragility of a recovery in the housing market.
The rate of home building was a 21 percent gain over January 2009, when the economy shed more than 700,000 jobs and markets were still floundering.
Some analysts said the slide in permits suggested the housing market was still struggling, and they noted huge supplies of previously owned homes were reducing construction demand.
"There are still massive headwinds," said Joshua Shapiro, an economist for MFR. "Prices haven't come down far enough, and people are still quite leery. The unemployment's rate's about 10 percent. It's going to be a very slow recovery for housing."
Some economists worry the demand for housing could tumble if borrowing rates veer higher as the government and Federal Reserve wind down programs to support mortgage and longer-term lending markets. Average rates on a 30-year mortgage are 4.9 percent, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.
Real estate agents and home sellers are also concerned that interest could wane when an $8,000 tax credit for home buyers expires in April.
In an encouraging sign for the manufacturing sector, the Federal Reserve reported Wednesday that industrial production increased 0.9 percent in January from a month earlier, solidifying beliefs that factories were restocking their inventories as the economy recovered.
Much of the growth came from a 3.2 percent monthly gain in consumer products and a 2 percent gain in production of materials, while production of business equipment and construction supplies each fell.

Full text: Wall Street investors, buoyed by signs of stability in the housing and manufacturing sectors, seemed optimistic about the speed of economic renewal on Wednesday as worries about mounting debt burdens abroad began to subside.
A rally in Europe and Asia, spurred by flashes of strength in the global recovery, spilled into United States markets, lifting to stocks of all types, including health care and telecommunications.
In addition, a batch of reports offered a snapshot of an economy that was slowly improving but still struggling to return to healthy levels.
Critical areas like home construction and industrial production showed signs of recovery, but questions remained about their long-term prospects.
On Wall Street, stocks climbed modestly. The Dow Jones industrial average ended the day up 0.39 percent, or 40.43 points, to 10,309.24. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 0.42 percent, or 4.64 points, to 1,099.51, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq composite index was up 0.55 percent, or 12.10 points, to 2,226.29. Health insurers and consumers goods led shares higher.
Several companies reported better-than-expected earnings on Wednesday, continuing a trend of surprisingly positive results. According to Thomson Reuters, 73 percent of the 393 companies that have reported earnings this year have beat expectations.
On Wednesday, Deere & Company, the farm equipment maker, said profit climbed 19 percent in the first quarter, leading its stock up 5 percent. Whole Foods Market reported a 79 percent surge in earnings in the quarter and offered a brighter outlook for the year, helping send its shares up 12.55 percent.
"The earnings numbers are getting people recharged again," said Linda A. Duessel, a strategist at Federated Investors. "All the concerns are the same -- the worries about overdebted countries and the deficit in the U.S. -- but they seem to be relaxing a little."
Concern over the debt crisis facing Greece and other countries on the fringes of Europe appear to have eased a bit. Investors seem satisfied, for now, with a plan by the Continent's finance ministers to pre-empt defaults in countries that are struggling to repay heaps of debt.
On Wednesday, traders were encouraged by a report showing that home construction rose 2.8 percent in January -- its highest level in six months -- beating Wall Street expectations. Economists closely watch construction because of the ripple effect it has for the broader economy. A separate report by the Federal Reserve showed that industrial production rose 0.9 percent in January, backed by gains in manufacturing, mining and utilities. That was the first time since August that all three sectors showed gains.
A third report indicated that import prices -- a gauge of inflation -- climbed 1.4 percent in January, largely because of a jump in the cost of oil. But prices for finished goods declined, and prices for consumer goods rose only modestly, easing inflation fears.
The gains for the American stock market followed similar upturns in Europe and Asia.
In Europe, the CAC-40 in Paris climbed 1.5 percent, the FTSE 100 in London rose 0.6 percent, and the DAX in Frankfurt gained 1 percent. Overnight, the Nikkei in Tokyo surged 2.72 percent.
Investors have again turned their attention to the underlying strength of the economy in the United States, and on Wednesday, they seemed cautiously optimistic about the pace of recovery.
"Out of nowhere, an eerie calm has crept back into the global marketplace," David A. Rosenberg, chief economist and strategist for Gluskin Sheff & Associates wrote in a research note on Wednesday.
Mr. Rosenberg suggested some momentum might be coming from talk that Republicans may be poised to make gains in Congressional elections in November, after news of retirements by several Democratic lawmakers.
"The shifting political winds may be offering investors something positive to chew on," Mr. Rosenberg wrote.
Shares of Toyota fell 2.45 percent, to close at $74.15 even as the Japanese car maker tried to ease concerns about the safety of its vehicles by promising to more quickly disclose defects in the future and announcing measures like a brake-override system.
The Treasury's 10-year note fell 20/32, to 99 3/32. The yield rose to 3.73 percent, from 3.66 percent late Tuesday.
Following are the results of Wednesday's Treasury auction of four-week bills:

Top-Earning U.S. Households Averaged $345 Million in '07

Full text: CORRECTION: Because of an editing error, a Bloomberg News article on Feb. 18 about the income of the 400 highest-earning households in the United States misstated their earnings. As the headline correctly stated, $345 million was the average income of those households, not the total for all 400.
The 400 highest-earning households in the United States made nearly $345 million in 2007, up 31 percent from a year earlier, data from the Internal Revenue Service shows.
The figures for 2007, the last year of an economic expansion, show that average income reported by the top 400 earners more than doubled from $131.1 million in 2001. That year, Congress adopted tax cuts proposed by George W. Bush. Democrats say those cuts disproportionately benefit the wealthy.
Each of the top 400 earning households paid an average tax rate of 16.6 percent, the lowest since the I.R.S. began tracking the data in 1992, the statistics show. Their average effective tax rate was about half the 29.4 percent in 1993, the first year of the Clinton administration, when taxes were increased.
The statistics underscore "two long-term trends: that income at the very top has exploded and their taxes have been cut dramatically," said Chuck Marr, director of federal tax policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a Washington research group that supports increasing taxes on high-income people.
The top 400 earners received a total of $138 billion in 2007, up from $105.3 billion a year earlier. Adjusted for inflation, their average income rose almost fivefold since 1992, the figures show.
They may provide ammunition for President Obama and Democrats, led by the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi of California, who say they intend to increase the capital gains tax rate and let tax rates for the highest earners increase in 2011.
Almost three-quarters of the highest earners' income was in capital gains and dividends taxed at a 15 percent rate set as part of 2003 tax cuts supported by Mr. Bush, the figures show. Of the 400 earners, 289 paid a total effective federal tax rate of 20 percent or less in 2007, the last year for which figures were available, the data shows.
William Ahern, director of policy and communications for the Tax Foundation, a Washington research group that advocates lower taxes, said the 2007 figures do not reflect the current economic circumstances.
"In a good year like 2007, it's not surprising to see that the owners and managers of the nation's largest firms made a fortune," he said. "Notice that two-thirds of their 2007 income was in capital gains, which have dropped like a rock since then."
The data was first reported by Tax.com, a Web site run by Tax Analysts, a publisher in Virginia.

Full text: EVEN after a modest stock market rebound last year, the downturns of the last decade have left portfolios bruised.
Millions of investors protected themselves in the traditional -- and most often ill-timed -- way. They reduced their stock exposure by moving into bonds. While that provided a bit of a haven in 2008, if inflation comes back or interest rates rise, bond values will fall. Those people who have most of their money in corporate bonds or income mutual funds can lose principal. And many people time market moves badly.
Diversification also failed millions of people as United States and foreign shares, and real estate investment trusts, plummeted in lockstep during the financial crisis. Under modern portfolio theory -- the guiding principle behind modern money management -- this was not supposed to happen.
But a strategy used by professionals offers some basic portfolio protection. It uses stock options to "collar" stock market risks without giving up future gains.
Collar strategies limit losses when stocks drop while providing some upside potential. Options are commonly used derivatives listed on stock exchanges that are linked to specific stocks or indexes. The strategy basically involves buying a put and selling a call option on a stock that you own. The former sets a limit on how much you can lose, and the latter limits your gain if a stock rises above a certain price. Both have target or "strike" prices.
The easiest way to employ the collar options strategy is to buy a mutual fund. The Collar Fund, whose ticker is COLLX, and the Gateway Fund, whose ticker is GATEX, are good candidates. While these funds are certainly not immune to market downturns, they do provide a fairly effective hedge. The Gateway Fund lost about 14 percent in 2008, compared with the almost 18 percent loss of its peers. The broad-based Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 37 percent that year.
Michael Chamberlain, a fee-only certified financial planner based in Santa Cruz, Calif., uses the Collar Fund for his most risk-averse clients, who range in age from their 20s to 70s.
"Asset allocation used to be the primary way to limit risk," Mr. Chamberlain said, "but the Collar Fund seems like a reasonable way to decrease risk while providing exposure to the stock market."
With the Collar Fund, options are bought and sold on approximately 75 stocks, representing 300 of the largest United States companies. Although it is less than a year old, its managers, Summit Portfolio Advisors, have been managing money using collar strategies in separate accounts for years. The fund charges about 1 percent annually to investors for management fees and has a $2,500 minimum investment.
Having employed options strategies since 1988, the Gateway Fund also focuses on risk-adjusted returns, but with a larger, more diversified stock portfolio. Instead of hedging a few stocks, it uses market indexes to get a bigger slice of the market.
Like many hedge funds, though, Gateway will lag the broader stock market on the upside. It rose about 6.6 percent last year, compared with a 16 percent gain for the S.& P. index. It carries a 5.75 percent sales charge (for A shares), 0.94 percent in annual expenses and a 0.25 percent 12(B)1 fee. The minimum investment is $2,500.
Keep in mind that neither fund can completely suit your specific needs. If you want to tailor a collar strategy to your company stock position or your specific portfolio mix, you can buy and manage options yourself or hire an investment adviser to do it for you.
Collar strategies may not work as a long-term play over decades. They are most useful if you are in or near retirement and you need to hedge a large stock position. If you do not have confidence with options strategies -- or do not have a full understanding how they work -- the mutual funds offer a way to participate in this protective strategy.
"You need something customized to your needs," said Zvi Bodie, a financial economist at Boston University and a co-author of "Worry-Free Investing" (Financial Times Management, 2008). "Collar funds are a safe substitute for target-date mutual funds, which don't protect you at all from the downside risk."

Abstract: For now, Mr. Bernanke, who was granted a second four-year term last month after a contentious Senate debate, has shown little appetite for applying brakes on the economy, though he has outlined a strategy for the Fed to gradually reduce the size of its balance sheet, in part to reassure the markets that he is mindful of the threat of inflation.

Full text: Wading deeply into fiscal policy is not normally the domain of the Federal Reserve, but several central bank officials have begun speaking out in forceful terms about the dangers of the expanding deficit.
Though only a minority so far, the officials are warning that a failure to bring the budget under control could lead to a dangerous spiral of inflation. Worries about the possible long-term effects of the deficit have galvanized political debate in recent days, culminating in President Obama's decision to create a bipartisan commission to tame the nation's debt.
The comments by Fed officials reflect, in part, a concern about the central bank's ability to maintain its political independence over the long term, a concern shared by the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke. Next week, Mr. Bernanke is set to deliver the Fed's semiannual monetary report to Congress, and economists will be watching closely to see if he too says anything about the debt and the deficit.
Thomas M. Hoenig, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City since 1991 and the longest-serving of the 12 Fed bank presidents, warned on Tuesday that in the worst case, the Fed could face pressure to inflate the nation's way out of its indebtedness.
"It seems inevitable that a government turns to its central bank to bridge budget shortfalls, with the result being too-rapid money creation and eventually, not immediately, high inflation," he said at a policy forum here, sponsored by the Peterson-Pew Commission on Budget Reform. "Such outcomes require either a cooperative central bank or an infringement on its independence."
Last Wednesday, the Dallas Fed president, Richard W. Fisher, said that interest rates on Treasury securities had been kept unnaturally low by the willingness of the Chinese to buy American debt and by shaky European economies, like Greece's.
"We cannot count forever on the largess or the misfortune of others to mask our own imbalances here at home -- for fiscal profligacy in Washington today hinders our ability to address fiscal challenges tomorrow," Mr. Fisher told the World Affairs Council of Dallas-Fort Worth.
The Fed has just two main responsibilities -- keeping inflation low and promoting maximum employment -- but balancing them is perhaps its greatest challenge. With unemployment at 9.7 percent, few expect the Fed to start raising interest rates for at least several months.
For now, Mr. Bernanke, who was granted a second four-year term last month after a contentious Senate debate, has shown little appetite for applying brakes on the economy, though he has outlined a strategy for the Fed to gradually reduce the size of its balance sheet, in part to reassure the markets that he is mindful of the threat of inflation.
Mr. Hoenig was the sole dissenter last month when the Fed's key policy-making body, the Federal Open Market Committee, voted to keep short-term interest rates near zero, where they have been since December 2008. Specifically, Mr. Hoenig objected to the panel's statement that "exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period" were still warranted.
Mr. Hoenig is known for his wariness of inflation, so his dissent was not entirely a surprise. But other members of the committee, while using more cautious language, appear to share at least some of his concerns.
In a speech last month in Arlington, Va., the Fed's vice chairman, Donald L. Kohn, said "the deficit is on track to remain quite large even as the economy recovers, pushing up the ratio of federal debt to gross domestic product substantially."
Mr. Kohn added: "Unless the trajectory is changed, the competition for savings between the government, on the one hand, and households and businesses, on the other, could be significant as households and businesses begin to borrow and spend in the recovery, putting upward pressure on interest rates."
And James Bullard, president of the St. Louis Fed, said in an interview last week that it made sense for the Fed to think about withdrawing from what he called its "unprecedented monetary policy" since 2008: the combination of near-zero interest rates and huge purchases of mortgage-backed securities and Treasury securities.
The expansion of the balance sheet helped drive down long-term interest rates and support economic recovery. But Mr. Bullard said the idea that "the worst part of the crisis is over, so maybe it's time to start adjusting" was sensible, adding, "I'm sympathetic to that argument."
Not all of the Fed's leaders are preoccupied about the prospect of inflation; some consider it remote and are more focused on the weak job market.
"I do think the news is mostly good on the inflation front, although the need for careful policy choices is even more critical than usual," Narayana R. Kocherlakota said Tuesday in his first speech as president of the Minneapolis Fed.
Mr. Kocherlakota told the Minnesota Bankers Association, in St. Paul, that the decline in gross domestic product during any recession was not felt evenly across the population.
"Some workers -- those who lose their jobs -- suffer much bigger falls in income," he said. "For this reason, many macroeconomists now believe that the true cost of a recession is not the fall in G.D.P. per se, but the associated increase in the risk of people becoming, and staying, unemployed."
Mr. Kocherlakota noted that employment was slow to recover after the last two recessions, in 1990-91 and in 2001, and that unemployment -- still at its highest level since the early 1980s -- has leveled off only because fewer employees are getting laid off or quitting.
"To get a true expansion in employment and in the economy, the hiring rate has to pick up -- and we have yet to see evidence that it will do so in the immediate future," he said.

Full text: The formidable skills of LeBron James probably won't reach the stock market. Speculation is rampant he could soon be headed to the New York Knicks basketball team, whose owner is now trading on the Nasdaq.
The listing followed a spinoff of Madison Square Garden Inc. from the cable operator Cablevision to its shareholders last week. MSG is a collection of trophy assets but doesn't seem to be a gold-plated investment.
In addition to the Knicks, MSG owns the New York Rangers hockey team, the Madison Square Garden arena, Radio City Music Hall and some lesser-known teams and theaters. But the teams lose money, and the entertainment division, home to the Rockettes Christmas show, only broke even last year. The real value is in MSG's two regional sports networks, where the Knicks and Rangers are the primary draw.
The shares look fully priced already, after rising to $19.76, or 8.5 percent, in their first days of trading. Analysts expect MSG to generate about $95 million in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, for 2009. Add $30 million from a new broadcast deal with Cablevision, a better year for the Rockettes, other television-contract renewals and narrower losses for the teams, and MSG might just have Ebitda earnings of $160 million in 2010, as some analysts forecast. Put that on a multiple of 10, the same as its closest peers, and you get an optimistic enterprise value of $1.6 billion.
Forget the cash on MSG's books -- it will be chewed up in an estimated $800 million renovation of the Garden -- and that equates to $21 a share.
That price overlooks fresh competition and potential corporate governance costs. The Barclays Center in Brooklyn, where the New Jersey Nets are expected to play, is to open in 2012. And the Dolan family, which controls Cablevision, still has significant sway at MSG. Conflicts are already apparent: The Dolans won't let Cablevision's rivals carry the MSG network's high-definition feed.
And then there's the LeBron factor. His presence will benefit fans more than investors. More wins for the Knicks probably will not be enough to offset the cost of his contract. So by all means buy a courtside seat at the Garden -- but sell MSG shares.
Sovereign Risks
Investors are not quite convinced that Greece is in the clear. The document of support from the European Union was a little vague, and the Greek government is still on probation. But the momentum has shifted from a growing wave of panic to a gradual spread of confidence across the euro zone.
The relief will be particularly great in Portugal and Spain, where the governments have been trying hard to keep bond buyers loyal and speculators away. Heavy borrowers in the euro zone are still paying a high price for their financing, but the Greek rescue means the money is likely to be there.
Elsewhere, the ingredients are in place for a government debt drama of historic proportions. The United States and Britain are still running deficits at double-digit percentages of gross domestic product. Like Greece, both have traditions of low savings rates and have been selling a substantial portion of their government debt to foreigners.
As yet, there has been hardly any problem. Yields on government debt are low and both countries still enjoy the highest bond ratings. As long as that remains the case, the huge borrowing can continue. But at some point, lenders may demand a clear Greek-style path to debt reduction.
That would require a politically challenging transition for these spendthrift governments. Morgan Stanley economists say that for the United States to stabilize the ratio of government debt to gross domestic product at 60 percent, it would need to run an annual budget surplus of 1 percent of G.D.P. That would require a shift of 12 percent of gross domestic product.
The Greeks might be able to manage such a shift, probably with European Union support. But unless the United States and Britain learn to match expenses with revenue, sovereign debts will remain a weight on the world economy.
But this does not mean defaults are inevitable. Unlike Greece, the United States and Britain have their own currencies, so they can use inflation to reduce the real burden of their debts.

What's Sustainable About This Budget?

Abstract: From 2005 to 2007, before the recession and financial crisis, the federal government ran budget deficits, but they averaged less than 2 percent of gross domestic product. Because this borrowing was moderate in magnitude and the economy was growing at about its normal rate, the federal debt held by the public fell from 36.8 percent of gross domestic product at the end of the 2004 fiscal year to 36.2 percent three years later.

Full text: PRESIDENT OBAMA'S 2011 budget, released this month, bears the title "A New Era of Responsibility."
"Let's invest in our people without leaving them a mountain of debt," the president said in his State of the Union address. "Let's meet our responsibility to the citizens who sent us here."
Noble aspirations, indeed. But do the numbers inside the document support the rhetoric surrounding it?
To answer that question, let's start with the definition of fiscal responsibility. What should the budget numbers look like before one gives them the Good Economist's Seal of Approval?
It may be tempting to assume that a balanced budget is the natural benchmark. Certainly, the Obama budget comes nowhere close to achieving that goal. But there are reasons to think that this standard is far too strict.
Sometimes, a budget deficit, even a large one, is called for. War and recession are the two classic cases. Wars lead to temporary surges in government spending, and recessions lead to temporary declines in government revenue. It makes sense for the government to borrow to make it through these tough times.
President Obama, like his immediate predecessor, is dealing with both war and recession. A transitory surge in the government's budget deficit is natural under these circumstances and need not be a cause for alarm.
Moreover, even in the long run, a balanced budget is too strict a standard. Because of technological progress, population growth and inflation, the nation's income and tax base grows over time. If the government's debts grow at or below that pace, servicing the debt will not become a major problem. That means the government can run budget deficits in perpetuity, as long as they are not too large.
Recent history illustrates this principle. From 2005 to 2007, before the recession and financial crisis, the federal government ran budget deficits, but they averaged less than 2 percent of gross domestic product. Because this borrowing was moderate in magnitude and the economy was growing at about its normal rate, the federal debt held by the public fell from 36.8 percent of gross domestic product at the end of the 2004 fiscal year to 36.2 percent three years later.
That is, despite substantial wartime spending during this period, budget deficits were small enough to keep the debt-to-G.D.P. ratio under control.
The troubling feature of Mr. Obama's budget is that it fails to return the federal government to manageable budget deficits, even as the wars wind down and the economy recovers from the recession. According to the administration's own numbers, the budget deficit under the president's proposed policies will never fall below 3.6 percent of G.D.P. By 2020, the end of the planning horizon, it will be 4.2 percent and rising.
As a result, the government's debts will grow faster than the economy. The administration projects that the debt-to-G.D.P. ratio will rise in each of the next 10 years. By 2020, the government's debts will equal 77.2 percent of G.D.P. This level of indebtedness has not been seen since 1950, in the aftermath of the borrowing to finance World War II.
Making matters worse, these bleak budget projections are based on relatively optimistic economic assumptions. The administration forecasts economic growth of 3.0 percent from the fourth quarter of 2009 to the fourth quarter of 2010, followed by 4.3 percent the next year. By contrast, the Congressional Budget Office predicts growth of 2.1 percent and 2.4 percent for these two years. Lower growth would mean less tax revenue, larger budget deficits and a more rapidly increasing debt-to-G.D.P. ratio.
The president seems to understand that the fiscal plan presented in his budget is not sustainable and, as such, is not really a plan at all. That is why the budget prominently calls for a fiscal commission that will be charged with "identifying policies to improve the fiscal situation." The goal, the budget says, is "to stabilize the debt-to-G.D.P. ratio at an acceptable level once the economy recovers."
In other words, President Obama's long-term fiscal strategy is to appoint a commission to figure out a long-term fiscal strategy.
It is impossible to say what such a commission will propose, and voters probably won't know until after the midterm elections this year. But Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, gave a hint in an interview last October when she said a value-added tax was "on the table."
A value-added tax is like a sales tax, but rather than being collected entirely at the retail store, it is collected in stages along the chain of production. Many European countries use it, and it is one of the more efficient ways to raise revenue. So efficient, in fact, that some conservatives fear that it would too easily fuel the growth of government.
YET despite its efficiency compared with other taxes, a VAT does not offer a free lunch. It would raise consumer prices, lower real wages, discourage work and depress economic growth. It would also break President Obama's pledge not to raises taxes on the middle class.
But unless the president revises his spending plans substantially, he will have no choice but to find some major source of government revenue. Ms. Pelosi's suggestion of a VAT may be the best of a bunch of bad alternatives. Unfortunately, in this new era of responsibility, the president is not ready to face up to the long-term fiscal challenge.

Full text: SPINELESS and shortsighted.
That's the complaint you hear around this time of year, every year, about politicians and their failure to confront the mushrooming federal deficit. Elected officials only care about what will get them through the next election, pundits say, not what is good for the country.
But really, can you blame the politicians?
Like bankers, politicians respond to incentives. Our political system encourages fiscal myopia, and will continue to do so even after the recovery solidifies. So long as politicians see fiscal profligacy as a prerequisite for re-election, the argument goes, they will postpone the hard decisions about tax hikes and spending cuts, and continue to overfish the revenue pool.
So, rather than obsessing over Washington's rubbery backbones, perhaps we should find ways to align the interests of the country with those of the politicians who are guiding it. Put another way, how can we get politicians elected on a short-term basis to think about the long-term good of the country?
The typical solution has been to form some sort of blue-ribbon fiscal-responsibility commission, as President Obama said he would do. Unfortunately, as about a dozen such commissions have demonstrated over the last few decades, this strategy almost never works.
Sure, these panels sometimes propose smart policy solutions. But they are not good at building the political will to make members of Congress (and constituents) eat their vegetables.
Other nations have tried different ways to get their politicians to think longer term, with varied success.
Some legislatures have tried tying themselves to the mast, Ulysses-style, by placing limits on their budgets. In recent years, Germany and Switzerland have adopted a "debt brake," constitutionally enshrining how much these countries can spend and how much they must save, depending on economic conditions. The Maastricht Treaty also limited how much debt nations could have before joining the European Union.
But it's hard to develop an approach that is flexible enough to allow discretion, yet rigid enough to be effective.
In the United States, Congress has tried to impose similar rules upon itself -- Pay-Go, Gramm-Rudman and the Byrd Rule, to name a few -- that have been cleverly unraveled. And state governments that are constitutionally prohibited from running deficits have been just as creative with their accounting.
On the other hand, some countries, like Sweden and Denmark, have "fiscal policy councils," generally made up of prestigious economists. They provide independent forecasts and analysis, and occasionally try to shame politicians into doing unpopular things. Such councils have a mixed record, depending in part on the country's attitudes toward experts.
An alternative might be to delegate fiscal policy -- that is, taxing and spending -- to a separate technocratic body, which can rely on legal authority rather than popularity.
Just consider why the United States has handed over decisions on monetary policy to the economists at the Federal Reserve. Giving these technical decisions to an independent central bank should, in theory, depoliticize them.
The analogy only goes so far, though. There is relatively more agreement about monetary policy -- for example, acceptable levels of inflation -- than there is about fiscal policy. Plus, there are infinite combinations of spending cuts and tax increases that can add up to the exact same bottom line. Is it really democratic to hand over such questions, with all of their social and moral consequences, to people who haven't been elected?
So perhaps the best fixes involve more directly changing the incentives for elected officials, rather than taking away their power.
For example, United States representatives serve exceptionally short terms: a mere two years (though senators serve for six). They are constantly running for re-election, and never have enough time to prove that austerity can sometimes be good for the economy. Perhaps if they had longer terms, they might be more sensitive to the longer-term consequences of their actions.
In other countries with lengthier terms for all lawmakers, like Sweden, where they serve four years at a time, politicians have made gutsy, painful budget cuts that later helped turn the economy around. Those cuts then became credibility-boosters that helped incumbents win re-election.
Brazil has a more creative strategy for changing the incentive structure for politicians. There, under the Fiscal Crimes Law, politicians who overspend can be barred from running for re-election, and even thrown in jail. But this strategy has primarily been effective for mayors and governors, said Michigan State University's Carlos Pereira, because the national government generally acts as enforcer. Someone still needs to play bad cop at the federal level.
The most foolproof way to impose fiscal discipline may be to instill a sense of crisis.
Indeed, just about every developed country that has overhauled its political system to promote long-term fiscal thinking seems to have done so either because a crisis was imminent or one was fresh in their minds.
Historically, fiscal crises have followed financial crises (yup, like the one we just had), so now is probably the time to start planning. But it has been difficult to spook Americans too much because it has been so blissfully long since we had a budget crisis; the last time the government technically defaulted on its debt was during the Great Depression.
Alas, we don't have a color-coded alert system to warn us about our fiscal condition.
We do, however, have credit rating agencies. Moody's recently warned that it might downgrade America's top-notch sovereign credit rating, which could alarm the markets and eventually make it harder for the government to borrow. Once upon a time it seemed we needed the government to save the financial markets; perhaps now it is the financial markets that will keep the government in line.

Full text: As most countries agonize over how to keep their barely reviving economies growing, China is already looking to slam on the brakes.
China's central bank moved late Friday to reduce lending to companies and individuals by requiring large commercial banks to increase the amount of cash they park with the central bank. The move, which came earlier than most economists had expected, was meant to slow China's breakneck economy and inflation.
It was the second time in a month that the central bank had directed the country's banks to increase reserves. In spite of the earlier edict, which took effect on Jan. 18, banks actually lent more money in January than in the previous three months combined, illustrating just how hard it is for Beijing to modulate its rapidly expanding economy.
Chinese economists now predict the economy will grow about 10 percent this year, while Western economists put the figure closer to 12 percent. The growth reflects a revival of exports, strong consumer spending and heavy government investment in infrastructure projects like high-speed rail lines.
But authorities in Beijing are walking a delicate and difficult line. They consider controlling inflation as key to domestic peace because in the past the erosion of the spending power of workers has led to unrest.
At the same time, if China brakes too hard, it risks slowing global growth overall and throwing other countries, including the United States, back into recession. For the first time in history, China's economy is acting as a major engine pulling the rest of the world out of recession.
Economic reports Friday showed that most of Europe's major economies either shrank or barely grew in the fourth quarter of last year.
The United States had strong growth in the fourth quarter, leaving many wondering when Washington will start increasing interest rates. The Federal Reserve has signaled it will be months.
Fears that China's move Friday would slow global growth sent share prices sliding across Europe and pushed New York markets lower when they opened, though they recovered some of the losses. China's commercial banks have become important lenders to the rest of the world as American banks have considerably reduced lending.
"The timing is a surprise," said Qing Wang, an economist in the Hong Kong office of Morgan Stanley, referring to the central bank's action.
Policy makers inject additional cash each year into the country's financial system before Lunar New Year to accommodate holiday spending. Raising the bank reserve ratio could prevent banks from turning that into loans for activities like real estate speculation.
Jing Ulrich, the managing director and chairwoman of China equities and commodities at J. P. Morgan, said, "The message coming out of China has been quite clear -- policy makers are becoming more concerned about containing inflationary expectations and managing the risk of asset price bubbles as a result of last year's aggressive expansion of credit."
Stephen Green, the head of greater China research in the Shanghai office of Standard Chartered Bank, said that he had been expecting one increase a month in the ratio for the foreseeable future as a way to slow the economy and the threat of inflation.
The government began a stimulus plan of more than half-trillion dollars last year, and even before that Beijing had a huge public investment program to strengthen the country's infrastructure.
At the same time, Chinese families are snapping up cars, apartments and other big-ticket items.
China passed the United States last year to become the world's largest car market by number of vehicles sold. Car sales in January were more than double the level of a year earlier.
Families, real estate developers and industrial companies have all been borrowing heavily and have started paying more for everything from food to apartments. Last month apartment prices surged and the pace of wholesale inflation doubled.
Chinese families have the cash to buy cars now partly because they still have extremely high savings rates by international standards and partly because the state-controlled banking sector went on a lending spree over the last year at the government's request.
China's banks largely avoided investing in the mortgage-backed securities, credit-default swaps and other esoteric financial instruments that have caused tremendous damage to the balance sheets of Western banks in the last two years, leaving them less able or less willing to lend.
The National Bureau of Statistics of China said Thursday that annual inflation in producer prices had more than doubled in January from December, to 4.3 percent. Average housing prices in large and midsize cities were up 9.5 percent last month from a year earlier, the fastest rate of increase in 19 months.
Rising producer prices and asset prices have not yet fed into high inflation in consumer prices, which were up only 1.5 percent last month from a year earlier despite an increase in food prices.
The central bank action Friday was aimed at keeping a tight rein on consumer prices.
The central bank pushed up the reserve ratio by half a percentage point, to 16.5 percent, for large banks, and 14.5 percent for small banks, effective Feb. 25. Small financial institutions that mainly lend to farmers, like rural credit cooperatives, are temporarily exempted from the increase to make sure they can provide loans for spring planting.
As the government tries to keep inflation in check, the conventional remedy in most industrialized countries would be to push up the interest rates that borrowers must pay for loans, typically through actions in money markets. But that would draw even more investment into China, at a time when the Chinese authorities are already struggling to control foreign cash that has been flowing in.
Banks have been keeping about 18 percent of their assets at the central bank recently. But raising the minimum makes it less likely big banks will start lending that money.

Full text: After clashing with foreign oil companies in recent years, President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela has shifted strategy and awarded contracts to Western oil companies, hoping to increase his nation's flagging oil production and pull the country out of a sharp economic downturn.
Chevron, the American oil giant, led a group of companies that won one of the concessions on Wednesday night, showing the resilience of trade ties between the nations. The United States remains the largest consumer of Venezuelan oil despite the deterioration of political relations over the last decade.
Venezuela quietly began courting Western oil companies again in 2008 after nationalizing some of their assets, imposing higher royalties on them and subjecting their executives to raids by tax authorities. Even now, Venezuela is considered one of the riskiest countries in which to do business of any kind, and a number of major Western oil companies stayed out of the bidding.
But the oil companies that participated are hoping to increase their access to the coveted Orinoco Belt, an area the size of Costa Rica in southern Venezuela that may contain one of the world's largest recoverable oil reserves. The United States Geological Survey described the Orinoco Belt last month in a report as the largest petroleum accumulation it had assessed, containing an estimated 513 billion barrels of recoverable oil.
Facing a decline in oil revenues and a dearth of foreign investment, Mr. Chavez seemed eager to address any lingering concerns the Western oil companies might have about operating in his country.
"Dear friends, partners, allies, you know you have all the guarantees of our Constitution and our laws," Mr. Chavez said Wednesday night in a ceremony at his palace, broadcast on state television, in which he thanked the foreign companies for bidding.
In an unusual display of warmth given his friction with Washington, Mr. Chavez happily greeted a senior Chevron executive in attendance, Ali Moshiri, the company's president of African and Latin American operations. Mr. Chavez conceded that differences remained with the Obama administration, but he also extended an invitation for President Obama to visit Venezuela's southern oil region, telling Mr. Moshiri, "You bring him here."
Some foreign oil companies that had shown interest in the auction -- including Royal Dutch/Shell, Brazil's Petrobras and Total of France -- opted not to bid. Mr. Chavez is moving ahead with nationalizations in other industries, like the seizure last month of stores controlled by the French retailer Casino, which appears to have scared foreign investors.
Chevron, which maintains the warmest relations with Mr. Chavez of any American oil company, led a group that includes the Mitsubishi Corporation of Japan, winning access to one area in the Orinoco Belt. The Spanish oil company Repsol YPF led another group that won a separate contract in a partnership with the Oil & Natural Gas Corporation of India and Petronas of Malaysia.
A contract for a third area in the Orinoco Belt was not awarded, reflecting the reluctance of other oil companies to take part in the auction. The groups led by Chevron and Repsol agreed to cede control in their ventures to Petroleos de Venezuela, Mr. Chavez's national oil company, in addition to securing all the financing for their projects, which could require as much as $30 billion.
If the two oil projects led by Chevron and Repsol are completed, they will each increase Venezuela's oil production by about 400,000 barrels a day, a crucial amount for the long-term economic viability of Mr. Chavez's government, which relies on oil for more than 90 percent of its export income.
The dependence on oil has grown more acute during Mr. Chavez's 11 years in power. Grappling with a steep drop in oil income since 2008, Mr. Chavez was forced last month to devalue the nation's currency, the bolivar. Venezuela is also struggling with a galloping inflation rate of 27 percent, the highest in Latin America, and intensifying electricity blackouts.
"It's not that Chavez is suddenly embracing a market system or respect for property," said Roger Tissot, an expert on Venezuela's energy industry at Gas Energy, a Brazilian consulting firm specializing in Latin America. "He's like a chameleon who can change his stripes when he realizes Venezuela's long-term economic survival is at stake."
Some private energy executives here doubt that the oil projects will materialize, given the technical challenges of extracting the Orinoco Belt's oil, which is heavy in impurities and hard to refine, and the uncertainty of doing business in Venezuela. Moreover, Mr. Chavez announced only the award of the deals; final operating agreements must still be negotiated and signed. Recent attempts to reach other oil production ventures with companies from China, Belarus, Russia, Italy and Vietnam have advanced slowly, if at all.
But concessions made by Petroleos de Venezuela and the oil companies during the bidding process suggested the seriousness of both sides, some energy analysts said. The groups led by Chevron and Repsol agreed to pay signing fees of about $500 million and $1 billion, respectively, as part of their bids. Some of the fees may be payable in installments, and possibly with vouchers used to offset losses from nationalizations.
"Chavez was clear in stating that Venezuela and the companies need each other," said David Voght, managing director of IPD Latin America, an energy consulting firm here. "When you decide to put down bonuses of $500 million and $1 billion, you are very serious about developing these projects."
Chevron in particular has a long history of doing business in Venezuela, opting to stay in the country in 2007 and become a minority partner with Petroleos de Venezuela after the government took control of foreign oil projects. Other American companies, including Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips, clashed with Mr. Chavez and left.

Full text: The rate of inflation at factories and other producers more than doubled last month in China, with producer prices climbing at the fastest pace in 15 months while the money supply continued to grow briskly.
The sudden acceleration partly reflects the low level of commodity prices a year ago during the depths of the global financial crisis, said Ben Simpfendorfer, an economist in the Hong Kong office of the Royal Bank of Scotland.
But the acceleration in prices at the factory gate was also the latest indication that China might be forced to continue tightening controls on bank lending, economists said.
The Chinese government typically does that through some combination of administrative controls on the volume of bank loans as well as higher interest rates for bills issued by the central bank.
Producer prices were up 4.3 percent in January from a year earlier, China's National Bureau of Statistics announced on Thursday morning. In December, the increase from a year earlier was just 1.9 percent.
As recently as October, China was still experiencing gradual deflation at the producer level.
However, consumer prices were up 1.5 percent from a year earlier, compared with a year-over-year increase of 1.9 percent in December, in a sign that factories and stores had not yet tried to pass on increases to retail customers.
A broad measure of money supply, M2, grew 26 percent in January from a year earlier, China's central bank announced separately on Thursday.
Rising prices in China could lessen tensions somewhat between the United States and China over the balance of trade between the two nations.

Full text: "At some point." "At the appropriate time." "When the time comes."
On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, outlined a strategy -- but not a timetable -- for scaling back the extraordinary measures it began taking in 2007 to prop up the economy as financial markets teetered on collapse.
The Federal Reserve has eased borrowing by lowering short-term interest rates to nearly zero and built up a $2.2 trillion balance sheet by scooping up assets like mortgage-backed securities and even vast sums of Treasury bonds and notes.
Eventually, to avoid inflation, both actions will have to be reined in. But Mr. Bernanke, in a 10-page statement, provided few hints as to how long that period will be.
"Although at present the U.S. economy continues to require the support of highly accommodative monetary policies, at some point the Federal Reserve will need to tighten financial conditions by raising short-term interest rates and reducing the quantity of bank reserves outstanding," he wrote.
"We have spent considerable effort in developing the tools we will need to remove policy accommodation, and we are fully confident that at the appropriate time we will be able to do so effectively."
Mr. Bernanke, however, did provide new details of a major concern: how, as the recovery proceeds, to gradually shrink the balance sheet, which along with a vast array of assets also includes $1.1 trillion that banks are holding with the Fed.
Mr. Bernanke suggested that a new policy tool -- the interest rate on excess reserves, which the Fed began paying in October 2008 -- would be a vital part of the Fed's strategy.
Increasing that interest rate, he said, will have the effect of pushing up other short-term interest rates, including the benchmark fed funds rate -- the rate at which banks lend to each other overnight.
It is even possible, Mr. Bernanke said, that the Fed "could for a time use the interest rate paid on reserves, in combination with targets for reserve quantities," to communicate its policy stance to the markets. Since 1994, the fed funds rate has been the much-watched centerpiece of statements by the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's crucial policy-making arm.
Representative Spencer Bachus of Alabama, the senior Republican on the House Financial Services Committee, which requested Mr. Bernanke's statement, noted on Wednesday that many in Congress never approved of the Fed's extraordinary actions in the first place.
"An intervention creates an artificial condition in which the system becomes increasingly dependent on government action," he said in a statement. "As with any addiction, an altered state is created where the only choices are permanent addiction or a sometimes painful withdrawal."
For days, economists have been trying to forecast what Mr. Bernanke would say about the sequence of steps and the combination of tools the Fed will use to tighten credit. On that subject, Mr. Bernanke offered only hints of his thinking.
"One possible sequence would involve the Federal Reserve continuing to test its tools for draining reserves on a limited basis, in order to further ensure preparedness and to give market participants a period of time to become familiar with their operation," he wrote.
"As the time for the removal of policy accommodation draws near, those operations could be scaled up to drain more significant volumes of reserve balances to provide tighter control over short-term interest rates. The actual firming of policy would then be implemented through an increase in the interest rate paid on reserves."
But Mr. Bernanke suggested that "if economic and financial developments were to require a more rapid exit from the current highly accommodative policy" -- that is, if fears emerge about inflation -- the Fed "could increase the interest rate paid on reserves at about the same time it commences significant draining operations."
Along with raising the interest rate on reserves, Mr. Bernanke discussed three other options for draining reserves. The first involves reverse repurchase agreements, in which the Fed would sell securities from its portfolio with an agreement to repurchase them at a later date.
The second involves term deposits -- similar to certificates of deposit -- to banks. That would convert part of the banks' reserves into deposits that could not be used for short-term liquidity needs and would not be counted as reserves.
A third tool involves redeeming or selling securities. That strategy could carry risk, as the Fed's large portfolio of mortgage-backed securities is helping to prop up the housing market and keep mortgage-interest rates low.
As part of its special lending programs to inject liquidity into the market, the Fed modified its discount window -- the traditional program for direct lending to banks -- to make terms more generous and to make nonbanks eligible for borrowing. That effort is winding down, and Mr. Bernanke said that "before long, we expect to consider a modest increase in the spread" between the discount rate -- the rate at which the Fed directly lends to banks -- and the fed funds rate. He emphasized that the change "should not be interpreted as signaling any change in the outlook for monetary policy."
Mr. Bernanke's statement elicited mixed views from economists.
Laurence J. Kotlikoff, an economist at Boston University, said that despite Mr. Bernanke's efforts to be reassuring, the prospect for serious inflation was real. "We could go from here to hyperinflation, basically overnight, because we've increased the basic supply of money by a factor of three," he said.
Mr. Kotlikoff also was skeptical about Mr. Bernanke's proposed solution. "The Fed printed more than $1 trillion in new money and then went out and handed it to the banks, and now they're trying to bribe those banks not to actually release it into the public stream -- that's what these interest rates on reserves are," he said, adding, that that interest also amounted to a free subsidy to banks.
Ricardo Reis, an economist at Columbia University, was more sympathetic, describing Mr. Bernanke's actions as innovative and necessary.
"The Fed can now return to having a 'boring' balance sheet with mostly government securities as assets, and bank reserves and cash as liabilities," he said. "The increase in reserves plus the payment of interest on reserves -- two innovations of the past two years -- are good things. They should remain."
Mr. Bernanke did note that the balance sheet would shrink on its own, over time, as assets like mortgage-backed securities and debt guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are prepaid or mature. "In the long run, the Federal Reserve anticipates that its balance sheet will shrink toward more historically normal levels and that most or all of its security holdings will be Treasury securities," he wrote.

Full text: An eye-popping increase in health insurance premiums in California has become a White House talking point.
Anthem Blue Cross, which is California's largest for-profit health insurer, plans to raise its rates for customers who buy individual coverage by as much as 39 percent by March 1, according to a recent report in The Los Angeles Times.
President Obama spoke about the matter at a news conference Tuesday, citing Anthem's move as an urgent example of why Congress needs to change the health care system.
"If we don't act, this is just a preview of coming attractions," Mr. Obama said.
"Premiums will continue to rise for folks with insurance," he said. "Millions more will lose their coverage altogether."
The company's increases also drew a sharp rebuke from Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services, who demanded on Monday that Anthem publicly justify them.
In a letter to the insurer, Ms. Sebelius noted that the company's parent, WellPoint, earned $2.7 billion in the last quarter of 2009, making the rate increases "even more difficult to understand."
Ms. Sebelius said the rates were rising up to 15 times as fast as inflation.
Steve Poizner, the insurance commissioner in California, has called for a review of Anthem's practices.
In a statement, the company blamed the recession and rising health care costs for the increases. It said that in the weak economy, many people had dropped their insurance, leaving "fewer people, often with significantly greater medical needs, in the insured pool."
Some industry analysts have suggested that several insurance companies are raising premiums pre-emptively in case Congress passes legislation reducing future profits. KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

Abstract: Ben S. Bernanke, having survived a surprising challenge to his second term as Federal Reserve chairman, now faces the delicate task of beginning to pull the central bank out of its extraordinary effort to prop up the economy. By that month, the Fed's balance sheet had ballooned to $2.2 trillion as the central bank doled out loans to commercial banks, issuers of commercial paper and foreign central banks.

Full text: Ben S. Bernanke, having survived a surprising challenge to his second term as Federal Reserve chairman, now faces the delicate task of beginning to pull the central bank out of its extraordinary effort to prop up the economy.
The main question is when and how the Fed should start raising short-term interest rates, which have been at a record low for more than a year. Related is the issue of how to manage, and eventually shrink, the record $2.2 trillion balance sheet that the Fed amassed as it pumped vast sums of money into the economy, starting in 2008. On Wednesday morning, the Fed will release a statement outlining Mr. Bernanke's views on moving away from its exceptionally easy monetary policy.
As a policy tool, Mr. Bernanke is expected to consider a little-known mechanism -- referred to as the interest rate on excess reserves -- that gives the Fed leverage over $1.1 trillion in bank deposits.
Most of those deposits were created as the Fed gobbled up mortgage-backed securities and Treasury notes and bonds during the financial crisis. The banks in turn parked the funds at the Fed as reserves. In the months and years ahead, the Fed wants to make sure that banks do not reduce their reserves too quickly, because it could create inflationary pressures as banks step up their lending.
To achieve its goal, according to Fed officials and speeches, the central bank will raise the interest rate on excess reserves, now 0.25 percent. It also plans to lift its target for the fed funds rate -- what banks charge one another for overnight loans and the centerpiece of its policy statements since 1994. But officials stress that rates will remain quite low for months to come.
"We're in a different situation than ever before, and the tools we are using are entirely new," said Lyle E. Gramley, a former Fed governor who now works at the Potomac Research Group, an investment advisory firm.
Mr. Gramley predicted that Mr. Bernanke would try to reassure the markets that the new tools would work. "There's an awful lot of talk that we're going to have inflation down the road," he said. "But this Fed is determined to maintain price stability. They've said that over and over again, and they want to communicate that to the markets."
Mr. Bernanke has used the term "exit strategy" to describe his task. Much like the American military's withdrawal from Iraq, the Fed's plan has few precedents and carries much uncertainty. At a minimum, officials have signaled, it will have to be carried out delicately, be flexible when circumstances change, and, most likely, be gradual.
With unemployment at 9.7 percent, the Fed may be months away from raising rates, but it is discussing the plan now to prepare the markets and tamp down inflation fears, said Vincent R. Reinhart, a former director of monetary affairs for the Fed.
"The reason they're starting to talk about the exit now is to reassure investors, so that they aren't pressed to head for the exit prematurely," said Mr. Reinhart, now a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. "Chairman Bernanke has to walk a very, very fine line."
If the Fed raises interest rates too hastily, it could choke off the fragile recovery. If it dallies, it might set off market jitters about rising prices.
But that decision occurs in the context of an economy whose normal rules have been reshaped. As Mr. Bernanke put it in a speech last April, "we no longer live in a world in which central bank policies are confined to adjusting the short-term interest rate."
The Fed's balance sheet has nearly tripled since the summer of 2007. At the end of that year, the Fed found new ways to lend to banks, and in early 2008, it began to cut interest rates aggressively, pushing the target rate for fed funds to nearly zero in December 2008.
By that month, the Fed's balance sheet had ballooned to $2.2 trillion as the central bank doled out loans to commercial banks, issuers of commercial paper and foreign central banks. The American International Group, the bailed-out insurance giant, and JPMorgan Chase, which bought Bear Stearns, also received aid.
Many of those programs are winding down. Two of the biggest -- the Fed's purchase of $1.25 trillion of mortgage-backed securities and of about $175 billion in debts guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae -- are to be completed by March 31.
The Fed in essence created new money to buy those securities, and now holds $1.1 trillion in reserves that the banks can demand when they wish. "The Fed's great worry is that instead of holding onto these reserves, the banks would decide they'd rather take the money they're tying up and lend it out," said Anil K. Kashyap, a professor of economics and finance at the University of Chicago's business school. If they did that, "you'd see broad measures of money growing quickly, and presumably that would be the start to having some inflation."
In the short term, that prospect seems remote, as banks have been wary and tightfisted in lending since the financial crisis erupted. But in the long run, a huge balance sheet carries risks.
The ability to charge an interest rate on excess reserves was created in 2006, after decades of discussion, when Congress granted the Fed such authority. (One reason it took so long is that the interest payments will reduce the amount the Fed turns over to the Treasury each year.) The tool -- which is used by other central banks, like those in England and Canada -- was to become available in 2011, but Congress moved up the date during the crisis. The Fed started paying the interest in October 2008.
Mr. Bernanke has argued that the new rate will eventually serve as an interest-rate floor, with the discount rate -- the rate at which the Fed lends directly to banks -- functioning as the ceiling, and the fed funds rate fluctuating in between them.
Looking longer term, Mr. Bernanke has four other tools that could be used gingerly to tighten monetary policy. The first is reverse repurchase agreements, or reverse repos, in which the Fed would sell securities from its portfolio with an agreement to buy them back at a slightly higher price at a later date. The second is term deposits, analogous to the certificates of deposit banks offer to customers. Third, the Treasury could sell bills and deposit the proceeds at the Fed.
Finally, the Fed could sell some of its long-term securities, including those backed by mortgages, taking more money out of the system. That strategy would carry risk given that the Fed's ownership of such securities is helping keep mortgage rates low and support the housing market.
Mr. Bernanke's statement was initially to be presented at a House hearing scheduled for Wednesday. After the hearing was postponed because of snow, he decided to release it anyway.

Abstract: The filing offers a glimpse of how China is trying to diversify its more than $2 trillion in foreign currency holdings with stock, rather than investing almost entirely in United States Treasury bonds and other debt securities issued by governments and by government-sponsored enterprises like Fannie Mae.

Full text: Flush with cash despite the global economic downturn, China's sovereign wealth fund quietly bought more than $9 billion worth of shares last year in some of the biggest American corporations, including Morgan Stanley, Bank of America and Citigroup.
Although most of the stakes were small, the China Investment Corporation, the government's $300 billion investment fund, now owns stock in some of the best-known American brands, including Apple, Coca-Cola, Johnson & Johnson, Motorola and Visa.
The detailed list, which contained holdings totaling $9.6 billion as of Dec. 31, was disclosed Friday in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission; it lists stakes only in companies traded in the United States.
The filing offers a glimpse of how China is trying to diversify its more than $2 trillion in foreign currency holdings with stock, rather than investing almost entirely in United States Treasury bonds and other debt securities issued by governments and by government-sponsored enterprises like Fannie Mae.
Prime Minister Wen Jiabao of China and other officials have repeatedly expressed worry about how the country's holdings of Treasury securities could be hurt by inflation or by mounting United States debt. By buying the securities of international companies, China is trying to spread its fast-growing wealth more widely. It is also seeking to acquire strategic stakes in companies that could feed its hungry economy with a range of commodities.
The China Investment Corporation, already one of the world's largest sovereign funds, was formed in 2007 with about $200 billion. It now has assets of nearly $300 billion and, according to state-run news media, is expecting another large injection of funds.
A spokeswoman for the corporation, which is based in Beijing, did not return e-mail messages or phone calls seeking comment. But analysts said the filing showed that the fund had invested only a small portion of its $300 billion in American stocks, and the fund seemed to be following a cautious strategy to diversify globally after initially having put its biggest investments into shoring up the capital of Chinese banks.
"This is still a relatively small amount compared to the total size of the fund," said Chang Chun, a professor of finance at the China Europe International Business School in Shanghai.
The sovereign wealth fund got off to a rocky start in 2007 and early 2008 by acquiring a $3 billion nonvoting stake in the American private equity firm Blackstone and paying $5 billion more for a 9.9 percent stake in Morgan Stanley.
Shares of both companies plummeted in 2008 during the financial crisis, leading to a storm of criticism directed at the wealth fund. But analysts say the fund performed well in 2009, particularly because it was buying aggressively as the market recovered.
Exactly when the investment corporation bought the shares of various companies was not disclosed in the filing. Its acquisition of nonvoting units of Blackstone and its early stake of preferred shares in Morgan Stanley are not listed in the filing, apparently because they are not traded equities.
The filing indicates that the corporation owns about $19 million worth of Bank of America stock, close to $30 million worth of Citigroup shares and about $333 million worth of shares in Visa, as well as holdings in various index funds.
The fund's largest listed holdings were $1.7 billion worth of shares in Morgan Stanley and nearly $650 million worth of shares in BlackRock, the New York money management fund.
The Morgan Stanley stake was acquired last June, when the investment bank issued about $2.2 billion worth of common shares to help repay the United States government under the Troubled Asset Relief Program. The Chinese fund acquired about $1.2 billion worth of shares at that time.
Some United States politicians in both parties have been nervous about China's growing financial reach, and have been particularly wary that China might seek political influence in the West commensurate with its corporate stakes. Four years ago, Congress discouraged Cnooc, a state-owned Chinese oil company, from buying the oil company Unocal, which instead merged with Chevron.
Most sovereign wealth funds, with the exception of Norway's, disclose few details about their holdings. But the Chinese fund made its list available for the first time on the S.E.C.'s form 13F, which is filed quarterly by institutional investors and mutual funds in the United States.
Ben Simpfendorfer, an economist at the Royal Bank of Scotland, said the Chinese sovereign wealth fund's decision to disclose its holdings could limit concerns about secrecy in government holdings.
"This should help reassure politicians that Chinese sovereign wealth funds can take minority positions responsibly," he said.
The Chinese fund's holdings outside the United States are substantial and growing. In Canada, it owns a $3.5 billion stake in Teck Resources, a mining and resources company listed in the United States, and a $1 million stake in Research In Motion, the maker of BlackBerry mobile phones.
The sovereign wealth fund has also been buying small stakes in Australia's biggest banks and paid $646 million last autumn for a stake in the Noble Group, a diversified commodities company based in Hong Kong with operations around the world in industries like iron ore mining and sugar mills.
Executives whose companies have accepted investments from the Chinese fund tend to defend it as apolitical.
Richard S. Elman, the founder and chairman of Noble, said last month that executives of the Chinese fund had been businesslike in their approach to the investment.
"They are hugely commercial, and they want results," he said. "They do not interfere in the day-to-day operations."

Abstract: The lack of a strong central government to back up the euro is the most obvious difference. Since last month, the European Council, the body that represents the 27 national governments in the European Union, has had a president for the first time, Herman Van Rompuy.

Full text: Whether he likes it or not, Jean-Claude Trichet is not just the president of the European Central Bank. Mr. Trichet, 67, is also the de facto president of Europe, at least for the 16 nations that rely on the euro as their common currency.
On paper, the European Union has just established a new president in Brussels, and the central bank's sole responsibility is to keep inflation in check. Moreover, the bank, based here, has almost no formal policy tools to help an ailing member country like Greece.
But as investor alarm about Greek, Spanish and Portuguese indebtedness increases, the crisis has highlighted the fundamental weakness of the European monetary union. With no strong political arm to ensure that members observe debt limits set by treaty, the responsibility falls to Mr. Trichet to try to resolve the crisis.
In the current situation, said Jorg Kramer, chief economist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt, only the bank's president "has the authority and the expertise" to manage the situation.
On Saturday, Mr. Trichet told reporters at a meeting in Canada of the Group of 7 finance ministers and central bank presidents that he was confident that Greece would meet tough new belt-tightening goals.
"We expect and we are confident that the Greek government will take all the decisions that will permit it to reach that goal," Mr. Trichet said, according to Reuters.
Just a couple of days earlier, Mr. Trichet lectured European governments on the need to swiftly pare their budget deficits. "When you share a single currency with others, the counterpart is that you have to have a sound fiscal policy," he said during a briefing in conjunction with the bank's monthly policy meeting.
But then, in a gesture that did little initially to calm nervous investors, Mr. Trichet pointed out that the overall deficit level among euro countries, at about 6 percent of gross domestic product, was still well below that of the United States and Japan, which are each set to borrow more than 10 percent of their G.D.P.'s this year.
Mr. Trichet delivers such comments in excellent English with a distinct French accent. Though he can be stern, he sometimes displays a dry sense of humor. Before the G-7 meeting on Saturday, he joked that by gathering in frozen Canadian territory, "we will have just the right environment to be as cool as possible in judging the situation."
Mr. Trichet sometimes maintains that problems with individual euro nations should be of no greater concern to Europe's central bank than the fiscal problems of an individual state are to the Federal Reserve in Washington. After being peppered with questions about Greece on Thursday, Mr. Trichet responded: "I doubt that, in a press conference, Ben Bernanke would have a question on Alaska or Massachusetts."
In fact, Mr. Trichet needs to be more outspoken than Mr. Bernanke because Mr. Trichet operates with many more constraints.
The lack of a strong central government to back up the euro is the most obvious difference. Since last month, the European Council, the body that represents the 27 national governments in the European Union, has had a president for the first time, Herman Van Rompuy. But he has few powers to discipline the 16 euro members.
"The ultimate problem is the nonexistence of a political union," said Mr. Kramer, the Commerzbank economist. "This is the big, big reason behind all the problems we are talking about."
The other big difference is that the central bank, unlike the Fed, is prevented from buying government bonds or offering direct support to troubled banks within its sphere. During the recent financial crisis, however, the bank showed it was able to find creative ways of bolstering the European banking system. It vastly expanded the volume of lending to banks, thus helping to avoid a more serious credit crisis.
In the current situation, the bank is aiding Greece by accepting Greek bonds as collateral that banks in Greece can use to borrow money. As long as Greece maintains its current credit ratings, the bonds qualify under central bank rules.
If the crisis worsens, it would fall to European governments to arrange a rescue of Greece or any other ailing country, like Portugal. While wanting to avoid anything that encourages further reckless borrowing and excessive government spending, they have indicated they will do whatever it takes to prevent a sovereign default of a euro member.
But the European Commission, the union's executive body, lacks the expertise to manage the delicate mixture of carrots and sticks that would be involved in any bailout, economists say. Last year, when growth collapsed in countries in Eastern Europe like Latvia, Hungary and Romania, Brussels essentially outsourced the rescue to the International Monetary Fund.
European leaders do not want to turn to the I.M.F. for help rescuing a member of the euro zone, its core unit.
That probably leaves them with the alternative of advancing aid funds, issuing bonds on behalf of Greece that would be backed by other European countries or guaranteeing Greek bonds.
While the central bank itself cannot supply the money, Mr. Trichet is bound to play a discreet but influential behind-the-scenes role. He has the advantage of being able to speak his mind without worrying about being elected.
That becomes a greater concern as European taxpayers become aware of how much a rescue may cost them.
Many seem resigned to some sort of bailout. Martin Mann, a proprietor of a Frankfurt wine shop, said that he expected the European Union to pay for Greece one way or another.
Asked if that made him angry, Mr. Mann shrugged. "As a taxpayer, I already have to pay the bill for so many messes created by other people," he said. "I would have to be mad every day."

Full text: WASHINGTON -- For decades -- through political upheaval and wars and wild bouts of deficits or inflation -- the debt of the United States has always been rated AAA, the gold standard of creditworthiness by which all nations are compared.
That was true before President Obama published his budget on Monday, with its projections of huge American deficits over the next decade and beyond. Astoundingly or not, it was as true after those estimates were published. Of course, had it been the United States Widget Company projecting red ink as far as the eye could see, no one would lend it a dime.
The closest thing Washington got to a brush-back pitch was a warning from Moody's, an investor service that rates the sovereign debt of nations: Without action to cut the deficit or a faster-than-expected recovery, the projections for the decade "will at some point put pressure on the triple-A government bond rating." Nobody blinked -- not Congress, not the White House, not the investors around the world who keep buying Treasury bonds to finance this year's $1.6 trillion shortfall, at low interest rates.
What explains this oddity? Why is the world betting that the United States will overcome its political deadlock and solve its problems -- believing, it seems, in the truth of Churchill's biting quip that America will always do the right thing, after exhausting every other alternative? And how long can this aura of invincibility last?
Maybe a long, long time. One of the many things that makes the United States different is that it prints the world's most important currency and can always print more -- one reason investors in government debt remain confident they will be repaid, even if in dollars devalued by inflation or by changing exchange rates.
There is also value in being the one nation on which the world still depends for security. That helps explain why foreign investors, including China, can denounce American politicians, Wall Street bankers and sleepwalking regulators for creating the current mess -- and still buy at the next Treasury auction.
This paradox of American financial exceptionalism was unusually clear last week. When the stock market shuddered on Thursday because of worries about national defaults, it wasn't Washington's mountain of debt that got everyone rattled. It was the plight of a handful of profligate spenders in Europe -- notably Greece, Spain and Portugal -- whose comparative foothills of debt suddenly made them dubious credit risks.
Each of those countries knows the meaning of "imperial overstretch." But it's been a few centuries since Madrid and Lisbon were centers of vast empires, and a lot longer for the Greeks. What brought them down this time was not global ambition but local gridlock, in which politicians could not, or would not, cut spending at a time of high unemployment and social need. Making things worse, they now are on the euro -- meaning they can no longer print their own way out of the problem, either. And it is unclear whether their partners in the euro bloc can afford either to bail them out or to let them default.
"They have no easy option," said Prof. Simon Johnson of M.I.T.'s Sloan School of Management. "They can cut spending or raise taxes."
Their problems may be minor compared to those of Japan, a battered economic superpower that prints its own currency and whose newspapers, two decades ago, regularly published charts projecting when Japan might overtake America as the world's biggest economy. The papers still run such charts, but now the question is when China will overtake Japan for the No. 2 spot (likely later this year).
Today, like Toyota, Japan's government is having a braking problem -- it can't figure out how to slow spending on a rapidly aging population, and like everyone else has reacted to recession by hitting the spending accelerator.
But unlike America, Japan is no longer considered so indispensible. For a quarter of a century it had a AAA rating, then lost it. Now Standard and Poor's warns it may further downgrade Japan because it has failed "to stem fiscal and deflationary pressures."
Japanese finance officials cringe when someone points out that their current rating puts them alongside Slovenia and Chile; a further slide strikes them as catastrophic. Still, by next year things could be worse: Japan's public debt is expected to hit $9.4 trillion, or 181 percent of its gross domestic product. By that measure, Washington still looks good, if only by comparison.
In 1990, sinking so low was unthinkable in Japan, which poses a question: What about America in 2030? Can the unthinkable occur here, too?
Jeffrey Garten, the former dean of the Yale School of Management, doesn't dismiss such possibilities. "Something's changed," he said. "The financial crisis created such a sense of uncertainty about everyone's assumptions that our relative decline is now acknowledged. The possibility that the United States may not be the world's unquestionably best credit risk is now discussed. And that's significant, because so much of this is psychological."
It doesn't help, either, that confidence in the rating agencies is also not what it used to be. They missed the dangers of the subprime mortgage crisis. They failed to foresee the 1997 Asian crisis. And they are, in important ways, captives of the past: The United States gets its AAA rating because of its track record -- it has always paid, on time and in full -- and because it has had a stable, comparatively transparent system of governance. Like Churchill said, it has always faced up to its problems in the end. And so, built into the rating, there is an expectation that it always will. Or, as Mr. Garten says, the outside world "is making assumptions about American political will that few on the inside will."
The assumption is that somehow, for example, Medicare costs will be controlled, or that new taxes will help pay for them. That somehow, Democrats and Republicans will join to change the trend because the trend simply cannot go on.
"We believe the Obama administration's own projections will not be realized," John Chambers, who oversees sovereign debt ratings at Standard and Poor's, said on Friday. He said many of President Obama's officials were in the Clinton administration when deficits turned into a surplus, "and they know how to do it again."
He acknowledges that "the political scenario is even harder this time." But this is a little like the cold war: Because the nuclear option was unthinkable, it never was used. That seems a part of the psychology behind President Obama's budget release. By revealing just how bad the numbers can be, Mr. Obama and his aides seem to be betting that the worst can be avoided.
The strategy could redefine "the full faith and credit of the United States." These days, it seems to mean: the more faith you have in Washington, the more credit it gets.

Full text: The death already seemed like a bitter injustice. A maid died after unexplained injuries she got in the house of her rich employer. But one detail in particular has outraged Pakistanis: she was 12.
Her employer -- a lawyer and a former head of the Lahore Bar Association -- says she fell down stairs, and died Jan. 22 of complications from a skin disease. Her family claims she was tortured. The employer remains in police custody while they investigate the family's charges.
Whatever the case, the death of Shazia Masih, a wisp of a girl from a bone-poor family, has served as a vivid reminder of the powerlessness of the poor in Pakistan.
Many wealthy Pakistanis employ children as servants, often to help with their own youngsters, a relatively common practice that Pakistani law does not prohibit. Slight and shadowy figures at the edges of birthday parties and nights out in fancy restaurants, these young servants, who rarely earn more than $50 a month, form a growing portion of Pakistan's domestic labor force.
The root of the problem is poverty, Pakistanis say, and a law would do little to stem the tide of desperate young people from the countryside looking for work.
"You can't imagine the poverty," said Muhamed Sharif, an employment agent who supplies maids, gardeners and security guards to wealthy residents of Lahore. "Sometimes they come in hungry. They will do anything for work."
It was raw need that brought Shazia into the house of Chaudhry Naeem, a prominent lawyer who lives in a wealthy neighborhood in this leafy city in eastern Pakistan.
She received $8 a month to wash his floors, his cars and his toilets, her mother said, money that went toward paying off a family debt.
Her parents, a house cleaner and a trash collector, earn $62 a month, too little to afford meat or fruit.
The system seemed to conspire against Shazia. The middleman who got her the job was pocketing a chunk of the little that Mr. Naeem paid her.
Because Shazia was a minor, she was not issued a badge by the neighborhood security agency, making her invisible.
If Mr. Naeem's lawyer is to be believed, Shazia was even rejected by her mother, Nasreen Bibi, who promised repeatedly to take her back but never showed up because she could not afford to keep her. Ms. Bibi denies the charge.
The circumstances of Shazia's death are in dispute.
A lawyer for Mr. Naeem said that Shazia was suffering from a skin disorder, probably scabies, and that Mr. Naeem had brought her to the hospital. She died while getting treatment, the lawyer said. Her death certificate says she died of blood poisoning.
Ms. Bibi says her daughter had been abused, an account that the medical examiner's preliminary report seems to support.
It lists 17 injuries, including bruised swellings on her forehead, cheek and scalp, "caused by blunt means." A more thorough medical report is due out in the coming weeks.
Mr. Sharif, whose agency is one of 10 serving Mr. Naeem's area, said that outright abuse was not common, but while the work was more comfortable than labor on farms, the maids were rarely treated well.
They lived a lonely life apart, using separate utensils, eating leftover food, and working more than 12 hours a day.
Children's heads are often shaved against lice.
Few, if any, go to school.
An employee of the security agency for the neighborhood said that he had returned five children to their parents since 2008, after they had run away from masters who they said were abusive.
The youngest, Allah Wasaya, a boy of 6, said his employer had hit his feet with a golf club when he did not fetch the man's shoes fast enough.
The employee, who asked that his name not be used because he was not permitted to speak to journalists, disapproved of such behavior, but said there was little he could do besides send the children home to conditions that might be even worse.
"We are not in a position to report them," he said of the wealthy residents.
As the poor get poorer in Pakistan, a job as a maid is a valuable commodity, even for a child. An estimated 40 percent of the population now live beneath the poverty line, far higher than 30 percent in the 1990s.
Inflation, now around 40 percent, according to the Social Policy and Development Center, an economic policy organization in Karachi, has caused prices for electricity, gas and food to spike, pushing millions more into poverty, economists say.
A British Council report last fall estimated that Pakistan's economy would have to grow by 6 percent a year to keep up with the expanding population, which over the past 20 years has been growing at twice the world average. The economy grew by 2 percent in 2008, the last year for which the government has statistics.
That potentially disastrous imbalance seems to go unnoticed by Pakistan's political elite, whose power struggles in Islamabad are as distant -- and irrelevant -- to the poor as the workings of the United States Congress.
The lack of a safety net has pushed people like Roxana, a 14-year-old with a bright face who was waiting for work in Mr. Sharif's office, out of school and into work to help her father, a plate seller, support 10 children.
Some relief has come in the form of the newly free media, which made Shazia's case a national issue, prompting visits to her family from top officials and even a fat check from Pakistan's president.
Mr. Naeem's beleaguered lawyer, G. A. Khan Tariq, bemoaned the coverage, which he said had blown an ordinary illness into a torture case.
"The media tried this case and issued its own verdict," he said.
The real test, however, will come in Pakistan's criminal justice system, a notoriously weak institution that is easily influenced by men in power.
"Our justice system operates against the underprivileged," said I. A. Rehman, a prominent human rights activist. "Will there be justice? I have my doubts."

Full text: Just as America's recession begins to ebb, trouble is brewing in Europe that may prolong a downturn on the Continent and ricochet through the global economy as it struggles toward a recovery.
A rout in stock markets that began in Europe spread to Wall Street on Thursday and around the globe to Asia on Friday, amid fears that Europe may be the world's next financial flashpoint. Pressure has been mounting across the Atlantic as Greece, Portugal and a handful of struggling countries that use the euro scramble to pay off mountains of debt accumulated from years of profligate spending.
The Dow Jones industrial average slid 2.61 percent, or 268.37 points, to 10,002.18 Thursday, after briefly falling below 10,000 for the first time since November, as American investors grew more uncertain about Europe's economy.
Stock markets across Europe slumped as much as 6 percent, and worries that the troubles might push even big European nations like Spain into a financial crisis drove the euro to $1.37, a seven-month low against the dollar.
Asian markets echoed the losses on Friday. The Nikkei in Japan shed 2.9 percent, and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong was also down 2.9 percent in afternoon trading.
"The question now is, how big is this fire going to be?" said Uri D. Landesman, head of global growth at ING. "What is panic, and what is legitimate? We don't know at this point."
Like the United States, Europe has been slow to exit recession. France and Germany -- the biggest of the 16 countries that use the euro as their currency -- have tried to put their financial houses back in order quickly. But countries on the fringe, including Greece, Portugal, Spain and Ireland, are having trouble paying for years of debt-driven expansion.
Now the bill is coming due. In the worst case, they could default on their debts, prolonging the economic downturn.
While the tension simmering in Europe has gone largely unnoticed by most Americans, the mounting pressure on these countries to discipline their finances has raised questions about whether the currency union that has peacefully bound Europe's economies for more than a decade risks unwinding.
Adding to the anxiety among investors Thursday was a bleaker-than-expected report on the United States labor market. Investors are watching unemployment closely as they try to gauge the strength of the recovery and determine whether it will be severely constrained by tepid consumer spending.
On Thursday, the eve of the release of the Labor Department's monthly employment snapshot, the government said the number of people filing first-time claims for unemployment increased to 480,000 last week, above Wall Street's estimates of 455,000. Analysts expect Friday's employment report to show that the jobless rate remained at 10 percent in January, and that 15,000 jobs were created.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index plunged 34.17 points, or 3.11 percent on Thursday, to 1,063.11, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 65.48 points, or 2.99 percent, to 2,125.43.
How Europe decides to deal with its problems will shape its future political landscape -- and the future of the euro itself.
Fearful investors have started asking whether France, Germany and other rich countries should be forced to bail out their poorer cousins, or simply allow them to default -- an outcome that would have major repercussions for Europe and financial markets worldwide.
The crisis in these areas "is reaching new proportions, and the contagion effect is getting more serious," two Royal Bank of Scotland officials, Jacques Cailloux and Harvinder Sian, wrote in a note to investors.
The current troubles began in Greece, which qualified for membership in the euro club in 2001. But the government never curbed shortfalls in its budget when times were good, and drastically expanded employment by adding to government rolls, even as an inefficient tax collection system reduced tax receipts.
While investors initially brushed off these problems, their worries resurfaced in October when the government conceded it had again buffed up its statistics to suggest a bright fiscal picture. Now, Greece has acknowledged its budget deficit stands at nearly 13 percent of gross domestic product, while debt levels are among the highest in the European Union -- well beyond what the rules of euro membership allow.
Greek officials are now trying to manage the country's deficit by partially freezing the pay of civil servants and increasing the fuel tax.
The European Union endorsed those measures on Wednesday, but the proposals have met resistance from other quarters. Greek customs and tax officials began a 48-hour walkout on Thursday, choking the flow of imports, and there were threats of more strikes.
Meanwhile, the dispute has put Greece's credit rating under renewed threat, and stoked worries that Greek government bonds might no longer be accepted as collateral by the European Central Bank.
The president of the bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, sought to temper the doubts about Greece on Thursday. He cautioned, however, that large deficits could be a problem for other euro-zone countries, unsettling investors. "When you share a common currency," Mr. Trichet warned, "the counterpart is that you have to behave properly."
Nonetheless, Europe's politicians, and global investors, have become deeply unsettled about other European countries with huge debt and deficits, including Spain, Portugal and Ireland. Investors have been demanding bigger premiums to hold the debt of these countries, and this week drove the cost of insuring their debt to new highs.
These worries deepened Thursday as Spain, saddled with 19 percent unemployment and huge debt from an American-style housing bust, played down fears of a budget deficit that has ballooned to 11.4 percent of its gross domestic product.
Portugal, whose deficits have also spooked investors, suddenly had trouble raising as much short-term credit as it wanted.
There have been whispers that Europe's better-off countries -- France, Germany and the Netherlands among them -- might come to the rescue with a bailout. If they do not, economists worry about the ripple effects of a default.
"There is a realization that the economy is still on very fragile footing globally," said David Riedel, founder of Riedel Research, which provides market analysis. "There are definitely another couple of shoes to drop here with the European crisis."
Amid the tumult, the European Central Bank and the Bank of England left their benchmark interest rates unchanged at record lows of 1 percent and 0.5 percent, respectively.
But in an illustration of the ragged nature of Europe's recovery, the British central bank took steps to freeze measures to stimulate the economy. The bank, reacting to rising inflation and evidence that Britain has emerged from recession, announced that it would not extend its large purchases of government bonds.
In the United States, interest rates were lower. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note jumped 25/32, to 98 3/32 and the yield fell to 3.61 percent, from 3.70 percent late Wednesday.

Full text: Facing food shortages, severe price increases and social unrest, North Korea appears to have relaxed, at least temporarily, its broad crackdown on private markets, news reports and officials in Seoul said Thursday.
If confirmed, the move to allow the buying and selling of goods outside the country's tightly controlled state distribution system could signal a political setback for the government of Kim Jong-il. North Korea had recently introduced a new currency and closed private markets in an effort to restore a purer form of central economic planning.
Indications that the country may be easing restrictions on trading follow reports this week that Mr. Kim had dismissed the official who oversaw the introduction of a new currency and the effective confiscation of private wealth in November. North Korea has not officially announced either of those developments, and it was not possible to verify them independently.
In the past week, the news media and government officials in Seoul have reported rare outbursts of protest in the North, but said that the episodes seemed isolated and that there were few signs of organized dissent.
By Thursday, North Korea had begun allowing trading in markets again, said the South Korean news agency Yonhap, citing unnamed sources familiar with the North Korean situation. Daily NK, a Seoul-based Web site that collects news from sources in the North, carried a similar report.
"In the past few days, we have learned that market activities are coming back in the North," said a senior South Korean government official whose departmental regulations barred him from speaking on the record about the North. "But we are not sure yet whether this is a policy reversal effective throughout the North or is some temporary adjustment."
Since 2005, North Korea had taken a series of steps aimed at suppressing the markets.
The strongest steps the government took against markets and the new class of traders who have profited from them began in late November when it abolished its old bank notes, requiring North Koreans to turn in their money for new bills at a rate of 100 to 1. By limiting how much they could turn in for the new currency to about $30 per person, the government wiped out much of private wealth, believing that that would help arrest inflation.
But prices of food and most other basic goods have since soared, as the state-run production and distribution system has not managed to meet demand.
Daily NK reported that after the government's lifting of the private trading ban, food prices in some towns began easing slightly. Yonhap reported that although markets reopened, people remained suspicious of the government's intentions.
Some analysts said the seemingly mistaken economic policies could have a lasting impact. North Korea's blunder with its currency "carried the risk of making North Koreans frustrated and fundamentally skeptical about their system and authorities," said Cho Han-beom, an analyst at the Korea Institute for National Unification, a government research organization in Seoul.
He said a possible summit meeting being discussed between the Koreas might be a signal of the North's need for outside aid to help defuse economic instability. The North's economic plight deepened under United Nations sanctions imposed after its nuclear test last year. International food aid has also decreased.
Yet others said they doubted that unrest was threatening to the government. "People can protest, but large-scale protests are impossible in the North," said Lee Dong-bok, a former senior intelligence official in Seoul.
Mr. Lee said North Korean villages were divided into tiny cells that allowed the party and military loyal to Mr. Kim to monitor each household and to block the spread of information.
For years, North Korea has openly admitted food shortages. In the past week, North Korean news media quoted Mr. Kim as saying he would redouble his efforts to fulfill the government's promise to feed its people.

Abstract: An estimated $26 billion can be saved by halting production of the troubled V-22 Osprey vertical lift aircraft and the hugely costly Virginia class submarine, slimming the still unproven missile defense program and refitting existing warships (not buying new ones) for Mr. Obama's new missile defense plan in Europe.

Full text: The cold war has been nearly banished from the Pentagon's latest review of military challenges. The Quadrennial Defense Review, released this week, finally catches up with the current world, one where the United States confronts a host of different adversaries on a variety of different battlefields.
It acknowledges that while the United States remains the world's leading military power, it is much more dependent on allies to help maintain international stability. It places long overdue emphasis on preserving and rebuilding the overstretched, all-volunteer force. It recognizes the need to rebalance American forces to perform multiple new tasks and to finally jettison cold war weapons that are too expensive, over budget, underperforming or ill suited to today's missions.
The review and the accompanying 2011 defense budget request still fall short, particularly in their failure to address the security-related consequences of a world of deficits as far as the eye can see. The review talks about the need for future "trade-offs" but suggests that that is only a possibility when it must be a given.
President Obama is asking Congress for $708.3 billion in defense spending for fiscal year 2011. That includes a base budget of $549 billion (the growth rate, adjusted for inflation, is 2.3 percent over 2010, compared with 4 percent per year from 2000 to 2009) and $159 billion for the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. The White House is separately seeking another $33 billion for the 30,000 more troops being sent to Afghanistan.
At a time when the country is fighting two wars, major savings are not likely to be possible. This Pentagon budget, like President Obama's last one, makes some tough choices -- but not enough.
On the positive side, the budget reflects the defense review's priorities by adding billions in new financing for helicopters, unmanned drones and special operations forces that are all crucial to the fight against extremists.
It also calls for canceling some anachronistic or unnecessary programs. Defense Secretary Robert Gates boldly took on the lobbyists and their many allies in Congress last year and canceled the F-22 fighter jet, a cold war relic. We applaud his efforts to try -- once again -- to end production of the C-17 transport plane, which military planners say they have enough of, and an alternate engine for the F-35, which the planners say is redundant.
He could cut more. An estimated $26 billion can be saved by halting production of the troubled V-22 Osprey vertical lift aircraft and the hugely costly Virginia class submarine, slimming the still unproven missile defense program and refitting existing warships (not buying new ones) for Mr. Obama's new missile defense plan in Europe.
The budget rightly calls for improved medical care and support programs for soldiers and their families; all are under incredible strain after eight years of war. Over the long term, defense planners are worried about this country's ability to pay for the all-volunteer military, in part because the annual cost of health care (for retirees as well as active-duty personnel) has skyrocketed from $19 billion in 2001 to more than $50 billion in 2011.
Mr. Gates was right this week to raise the issue of unrealistically low annual health insurance premiums for military retirees (active-duty military do not pay for health care), saying they have not been increased (from $460 per family, $230 per individual) in 15 years.
Congress now gets to poke, prod and, we hope, seriously debate the budget and the defense review. It must start with another post-cold-war notion: The country cannot afford to write the Pentagon a blank check. And that means that Congress will have to spend less time listening to defense lobbyists and more time thinking about the country's real strategic needs.

Full text: Ben S. Bernanke stepped into the imposing two-story marble atrium at the Federal Reserve's headquarters and took the oath of office from his deputy. The president lauded Mr. Bernanke as "an economist's economist" who had "earned the respect of the global financial community." A cabinet secretary, members of Congress and two former Fed chairmen looked on.
That was then.
This is now. Mr. Bernanke was sworn in Wednesday to a second four-year term as chairman of the central bank in a quiet ceremony that had none of the pomp and praise of four years ago.
Back then, on Feb. 6, 2006, unemployment was 4.8 percent and the Fed had just raised its benchmark interest rate to 4.5 percent as it tried to slow the economy and prevent inflation. The Senate had confirmed Mr. Bernanke by acclaim. The Fed's institutional prestige was so high that George W. Bush paid a rare visit -- only the third president to do so.
Today, the unemployment rate is 10 percent, and the Fed has kept the federal funds rate, its main policy lever, near zero for more than a year as Mr. Bernanke and the bank have been criticized for contributing to the housing bubble and the financial collapse.
The Senate reconfirmed Mr. Bernanke Jan. 28 by the narrowest margin in the Fed's 96-year history, and only after lobbying by the White House.
Neither President Obama nor any other top official attended Wednesday's ceremony, held in the same atrium in the Marriner S. Eccles Federal Reserve Board Building, named for a former chairman. It was restricted to staff members, although Mr. Bernanke's wife, Anna, was present.
After the Fed's vice chairman, Donald L. Kohn, administered the oath, Mr. Bernanke told employees that he had begun his second term "with considerable gratitude and not a little humility," according to a 717-word statement supplied by the Fed.
"At the Federal Reserve and other agencies, the crisis revealed weaknesses and gaps in the regulation and supervision of financial institutions and financial markets," Mr. Bernanke said. The Fed, he said, was revamping how it conducts oversight and collaborating with Congress and financial authorities in other countries to reform banking regulations.
However, Mr. Bernanke also defended the Fed's autonomy, at a time when some critics in Congress have called for auditing its monetary policy.
"Institutional independence brings with it fundamental obligations of transparency, responsiveness and accountability," Mr. Bernanke said, adding: "It is essential that the public have the information it needs to understand and be assured of the integrity of all our operations, including all aspects of our balance sheet and our financial controls."
Earlier on Wednesday, Kevin M. Warsh, another Fed governor, suggested in a speech in Manhattan that the regulatory debate in Congress was not addressing the right questions.
"Policy makers, in my view, should be more focused on what constitutes effective prudential supervision, rather than be diverted to the less consequential discussion as to who should perform it," Mr. Warsh told the New York Association for Business Economics.
Mr. Warsh said the idea of "resolution authority" -- which would empower a regulator to step in and dismantle a failing financial institution before it jeopardized the economy -- "is unlikely, in the near term, to drive the market discipline required to avoid the recurrence of financial crises."
Mr. Warsh called for more accurate and timely information to be provided to shareholders, creditors and regulators; more robust competition in the financial services industry, which he described as "ripe for a healthy dose of creative destruction"; and stronger capital and liquidity requirements, along with better corporate governance and risk management.
"We need a new financial architecture, one in which improved regulation and supervision play an important but co-extensive role with greater market discipline," he said.

Abstract: Poujade (who was, of course, the satisfied recipient of many state benefits, from retirement pensions to health insurance) channeled the swelling of popular resentment by creating the Union for the Defense of Shopkeepers and Artisans. During the subsequent national elections, the Poujadists bulldozed their way into town meetings, shouting down opposing candidates and threatening violence: a grim rehearsal for Tea Party tactics during last year's health care debates.

Full text: MORE than 100,000 angry citizens united in the nation's capital to take their country back: back from the tax collector and the political and financial elites, back from bureaucrats and backroom wheelers and dealers and, more elusively and alarmingly, back from those who, well, were not like them.
These weren't the incensed Americans who helped elect Scott Brown in the Massachusetts Senate race and who rallied around conservative candidates in the Illinois primary on Tuesday; this scene didn't take place at the Tea Party demonstration in Washington last year. These protesters were gathered in France a half-century ago: Last week was the 55th anniversary of the mass demonstration in Paris of the Poujadist movement, a phenomenon that bears a close resemblance to our own Tea Party. For a brief moment, the movement threatened the very foundations of the French Republic. A comparison between France then and America now may be instructive.
In the 1950s, postwar reconstruction and the Marshall Plan transformed France, which had been largely rural and agricultural, into a rapidly urbanizing and industrializing nation. While many welcomed these sweeping social and economic changes -- it was the era of Formica and frigos (refrigerators) -- many others feared and resented them.
Ever since the nation's liberation in 1945, a deep division had run down the middle of the French ideological spectrum: the Gaullists and Catholics on the one side, the Communists and their fellow travelers on the other. The political center had evaporated in the crucible of the cold war. The parliamentary system became ever more dysfunctional, lurching from one crisis to another as the competing parties accused one another of working against the interests of the man in the street.
The man (and woman) in the street had a different take. Neither the traditional right nor left seemed interested in his plight. Inflation dogged his heels and the influx of consumer and cultural goods from America breathed ever more warmly on his neck. Yet in the face of this widespread anxiety, the professional political class seemed indifferent. At this critical moment, Pierre Poujade leapt onto the national stage.
A stationer in Saint-Cere, a small town in southwestern France, Poujade mobilized his fellow shopkeepers against government tax inspectors in 1953. He found a ready audience: le petit commercant was increasingly squeezed between the spread of chain stores and a heavy-handed state bureaucracy.
Poujade (who was, of course, the satisfied recipient of many state benefits, from retirement pensions to health insurance) channeled the swelling of popular resentment by creating the Union for the Defense of Shopkeepers and Artisans. By the end of the year, membership had rocketed, transforming the group from a provincial curiosity to a real and present danger to politics as usual.
Short and barrel-chested -- he had once been a dockworker -- Poujade had a booming voice that amplified the anxiety of his populist followers. France's woes, he declared, were due to an urbane and urban professional class that had "lost all contact with the real world." In his autobiography, titled "I've Chosen to Fight," Poujade styled himself as a simple man of the people who had entered politics for selfless and patriotic reasons.
The real France, he insisted, was found not in Paris, but in small towns and on farms. It was certainly not found in the person of France's most promising politician, Pierre Mendes-France, who as prime minister had acted on many of his campaign promises for meaningful economic and political change. For Poujade, the young and cerebral Mendes-France, a Sephardic Jew whose family had lived in France for several generations, was and would always be a foreigner.
By Jan. 24, 1955, when the shopkeepers' group staged its huge rally in Paris, the movement's nostalgic longing for a simpler time had veered toward violent anti-parliamentarianism. There were also overtones of anti-Americanism (rumors flew that Coca-Cola had bought Notre-Dame with the intention of turning its western facade into a billboard) and anti-Semitism. The group's rallying cry -- Sortez les sortants! ("Throw the bums out!") -- challenged the right as well as the left.
During the subsequent national elections, the Poujadists bulldozed their way into town meetings, shouting down opposing candidates and threatening violence: a grim rehearsal for Tea Party tactics during last year's health care debates. Their tactics, if not their platform -- they did not, in fact, have one -- worked. Poujade's party won more than 10 percent of the votes, taking more than 50 seats in the National Assembly.
The election, though, proved to be Poujade's swan song. He had demanded the nation's ear, but once he and his fellow deputies had it, they had nothing substantive to say. Slogans and placards were poor preparation for governance, and the group's rank and file soon either retreated from the political arena or joined the traditional right.
By 1958, most Poujadists were ready to throw their support behind a far more impressive opponent of the Fourth Republic, Charles de Gaulle. When de Gaulle assumed power and held a referendum that replaced the parliamentary system with an authoritarian executive, Poujade's former adherents overwhelmingly voted yes. As for Poujade himself, he had already become a footnote to French history.
Historical parallelism is the duct tape of my profession: we apply it to the most disparate things. Sooner or later the tape frays, revealing unique fissures that require individual attention. Perhaps this is the case with the Poujadists and the Tea Partiers. Saint-Cere is far from Wasilla, Alaska; questioning Mendes-France's origins is not quite the same as demanding President Obama's birth certificate; the mendacity in the claim of France's imminent coca-colonization is of a different order from that concerning the than the misinformation about death panels in the United States. In both instances, however, the despair and disconnect with politics seem similarly great and real, as does the common tendency to grasp for simple solutions to complex problems.
Tea Party activists might find it infuriating ever to be compared to the nation they consider the anti-America. But French observers of our country may be forgiven if they feel a certain deja vu when they see a movement that brings nothing to the ballot box except anger.

Full text: Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Monday that he was replacing the general in charge of the Pentagon's largest weapons program -- the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter -- and withholding $614 million in award fees from the contractor, Lockheed Martin.
The surprise announcement came from a Pentagon chief who has sought to impose accountability across the department's senior leadership and who himself had promoted plans for the new plane last year in persuading Congress to kill the more expensive F-22 fighter jet. But a special Pentagon review team has since warned of possibly billions of dollars in cost overruns on the plane, and Mr. Gates announced that he was restructuring the program and requiring the company to cover some of the extra costs.
Mr. Gates disclosed the reshuffling on the F-35 program as he released the Pentagon's proposed $708.3 billion spending package for the fiscal year 2011.
After a dramatic first year in which the Obama administration killed the F-22 and other expensive weapons programs, the Pentagon presented a new budget that includes a $14.8 billion increase over the current spending totals. Perhaps more important in the long term, the proposed spending plan represents a consolidation of Mr. Gates's desire to add money to try to win today's wars rather than spending as much on future weaponry.
The proposed increases reflect the rising cost of the war in Afghanistan and a push by military leaders to keep their basic budget growing faster than inflation.
Some of the extra money is intended to pay for helicopters needed to transport troops in rugged environments, for unmanned planes to provide surveillance on enemy movements and for more Special Operations forces needed in Afghanistan and a mix of other possible wars. Those spending priorities are explained in a new war-fighting strategy review that the Pentagon also released on Monday.
But the increases come at a time when President Obama has frozen spending on many domestic programs, and many Democrats in Congress could find them hard to take politically.
And while Mr. Gates said Lockheed Martin had agreed to absorb part of the cost overruns on the Joint Strike Fighter, industry consultants said other military companies were delighted that, once again, a long-expected turndown in military spending had not hit.
"The defense industry is pleased but bemused," said Loren Thompson, the chief operating officer at the Lexington Institute, a policy group financed partly by military contractors. "It's been telling itself for years that when the Democrats got control it would be bad news for weapons programs. But the spending keeps going on."
All told, the administration said Monday that it wanted to increase the Pentagon's regular spending by 3.4 percent, to $548.9 billion in the 2011 fiscal year from $530.8 billion this year. It also asked Congress to approve $159.3 billion for next year to cover the cost of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.
The White House said it was also seeking an additional $33 billion now to pay for the 30,000 extra troops being sent to Afghanistan. That would bring the total war spending for this year to $162.6 billion.
Mr. Gates said the program manager on the F-35, Maj. Gen. David Heinz of the Marine Corps, would be replaced by a higher-ranking general whose name would be announced soon.
"A number of key goals and benchmarks were not met," he said, adding that "the taxpayer should not have to bear the entire burden of getting the J.S.F. program back on track."
In a statement issued late Monday, Lockheed Martin said it had been working with military officials "on a plan to get the program back on track" and was "committed to stabilizing F-35 cost, affordability and to fielding the aircraft on time."
Mr. Gates said he planned to extend the development phase by a year. Pentagon officials said they would delay the purchase of 122 planes and expand the flight testing to try to avoid much of the $16 billion in cost overruns that the review team had projected.
The Air Force, the Navy and the Marines plan to buy 2,400 of the planes over the next 25 years, and eight allied nations have also invested in the project.
Mr. Gates also said he would try again to kill two programs -- the C-17 cargo plane and an alternate engine for the F-35 -- that Congress saved last year.
The new Defense Department spending proposal and the strategy reviews, Mr. Gates said, "are shaped by a bracing dose of realism -- realism with regard to risk, realism with regard to resources."
"We have, in a sober and clear-eyed way, assessed risk, set priorities, made tradeoffs and identified requirements based on plausible, real-world threats, scenarios and potential adversaries," he said.
To calm critics who might argue that his emphasis on winning today's wars in Iraq and Afghanistan put future American security at risk, Mr. Gates noted that his budget had shifted only 7 percent to 10 percent of spending to today's missions and needs, and that 40 percent would pay for weapons that can fight all types of wars. That leaves half the budget still devoted to traditional threats.
Every four years, Congress requires the Pentagon to produce its Quadrennial Defense Review, an assessment of long-range strategy and the budgets to pay for them. In unveiling the review Monday, Michele A. Flournoy, the under secretary of defense for policy, said the strategy document for the first time jettisoned a historic planning requirement that the American military prepare to fight two major conventional wars at the same time.
Instead, the Pentagon's new strategy calls on the military to prepare for a much broader -- and more complicated -- set of national security requirements, that may include traditional combat against a state adversary, operations against foreign terrorists, counter-insurgency efforts, missions to mitigate natural or terrorist disasters at home and operations in cyberspace.
With a record number of veterans projected to use its health care system, the Department of Veterans Affairs has requested a $125 billion budget for 2011, a 10 percent increase. The department proposed creating more than 4,000 new permanent positions to help process a backlog of disability claims.
That backlog is expected to increase with new claims not only from Iraq and Afghanistan veterans, but also from Vietnam-era veterans with diseases related to exposure to Agent Orange, the chemical defoliant. The department is also requesting $13.7 billion in one-time spending for the current year to pay retroactive claims for three diseases it now presumes to be caused by Agent Orange: Parkinson's disease, ischemic heart disease and hairy-cell leukemia.

Full text: Manufacturing in the United States expanded at the fastest rate in five years in January, renewing hope that rising activity at the nation's factories may help lead the economy out of its downturn.
New orders increased, employment picked up and production gained strength last month, according to the Institute for Supply Management's monthly barometer. Nearly every corner of the sector, from textile mills to plastics factories, reported growth.
"If you look at the last two recessions, we didn't hit this kind of pace of manufacturing growth until two to three years into the recovery," said John Ryding, chief economist for RDQ Economics. "Manufacturing is rebounding more sharply even after going through a much deeper recession."
The manufacturing barometer reached 58.4 in January, up from 54.9 in December and above analyst's forecasts of 55.5 (a reading above 50 signals expansion). Employment reached its highest level since 2006.
A critical reason for the growth in manufacturing is that many factories are letting their stockpiles shrink at a slower rate than they had previously. In addition, exports are rising , and domestic demand is improving in part because of government stimulus efforts.
As economists sketch the outlook for a recovery, manufacturing is considered one of the few sectors that may have enough momentum to drive growth. The economy grew at an annual rate of 5.7 percent in the fourth quarter, and this year, economists expect manufacturing to outpace the overall growth rate.
The bright outlook for manufacturing contrasts starkly with the forecast for an area like consumer spending, a historical hotbed of economic activity. A separate report on Monday underscored the mediocre outlook for spending prospects: high unemployment has kept wages low in the United States, and Americans appear to be saving more in light of depleted retirement accounts and tight credit.
The government has pumped billions into the economy as it tries to lure Americans back to the cash register. In December, however, those efforts showed only modest results, with spending up 0.2 percent and income up 0.4 percent, according to the Commerce Department.
"It's not booming growth, but it is growth," said Michael E. Feroli, chief United States economist for JPMorgan Chase. "We're not seeing really strong labor income growth yet, and that's the biggest restraint on consumers."
On Friday, the government will offer its latest snapshot of unemployment, and the jobless rate is expected to remain at 10 percent.
Americans' views on spending appear to be fundamentally shifting. After decades of carefree spending facilitated by the easy availability of credit, consumers are saving more. The saving rate -- the proportion of income remaining after expenses and taxes -- reached 4.8 percent in December, and economists expect it to continue to rise.
A gauge of inflation in the report showed a 1.5 percent growth in prices compared with 2008. Despite the increase, economists say they believe inflation is not an immediate threat because of the large amount of unused capacity in the economy and high unemployment.
A third report on Monday showed that construction spending fell more than expected in December, dragged down by a troubled commercial real estate market. Spending fell 1.2 percent, to an annual rate of $902.6 billion -- the fifth decrease in six months. Analysts had expected a 0.5 percent drop.
Construction of single-family homes appears to be slowing, increasing 0.6 percent in December, the smallest gain in seven months. Construction of public buildings was also weak, falling for a fifth consecutive month.
Construction spending has suffered in the face of falling rents, higher vacancies and the travails of financiers who bet huge amounts on large complexes, like Stuyvesant Town in New York City. Construction spending fell 12.4 percent last year, compared with 2008.

Full text: A range of economic data released on Monday underscored the Asia-Pacific region's rebound from the global turmoil of last year, but also highlighted the challenges facing governments as they sought to solidify that growth while reining in nascent inflation.
With the exception of Japan, the region has powered ahead since mid-2009 as stimulus measures took hold and the collapse in global demand began to bottom out.
Data from China, India and South Korea showed that the trend continued into 2010, despite recent efforts by officials in Beijing to restrict some of the vast bank lending that helped drive the country's economic rebound last year.
Two purchasing managers indexes for China showed manufacturing activity there continued to expand in January: a reading by Markit Economics and HSBC rose to a record of 57.4, from 56.1 in December, while a government-backed index came in at 55.8, also well above 50, which separates expansion from contraction.
Similarly, an index for India rose to 57.6 last month, compared with 55.6 in December. And in South Korea, exports in January were up 47.1 percent from a year earlier, data published on Monday showed.
By comparison, the Markit Economics' purchasing managers index for the euro zone rose to 52.4 in January, from 51.6 in December, illustrating how the recovery in that region was lagging behind much of Asia.
But the statistics from Asia also contained new reminders that policy makers faced a delicate balancing act as they begin to scale back some of the extraordinary stimulus measures put in place during the financial crisis.
In China, the official purchasing managers index reading for January was actually down slightly from December, and the export figures from South Korea fell short of what economists had expected. This highlights how the recovery in demand -- including that from the United States -- still has some distance to go.
South Korea's export growth should pick up in February, analysts at Barclays Capital commented in a note. But "given the bumpy nature of the ride so far," they added "we believe the government is in no hurry to normalize its expansionary policies."
In other words, a rise in interest rates, of perhaps a quarter of a percentage point, is unlikely before March at the earliest, the Barclays team and many other economists believe.
The authorities in China, too, have to tread carefully: On one hand, they want to clamp down on lending by state-controlled banks, as that has been partly responsible for rapid rises in property prices.
On the other hand, reduced lending or higher interest rates could risk choking off growth if done too precipitously.
The government's moves to restrict loan growth have also worried stock market investors, contributing to a pronounced sell-off in China and elsewhere over the last two weeks.
"Industrial activity continues to accelerate, implying stronger G.D.P. growth in the first quarter," commented Qu Hongbin, China economist at HSBC, in a note accompanying the HSBC P.M.I. index. "But rising input and output prices also point to greater inflationary pressure, which will likely prompt more tightening measures in the coming months."
So far, such measures have focused on curtailing the banks' discretion in extending credit rather than on raising interest rates.
A report published by the state-run Xinhua News Agency on Monday indicated that Chinese banks significantly slowed lending in the second half of January.
Similarly, India's central bank last week told banks to keep more cash in reserve. But it left interest rates unchanged, amid nervousness that an outright rate increase could stifle growth.
Still, most governments in the Asia-Pacific region are months ahead of the rest of the world in scaling back the stimulus drives of 2008 and 2009.
Australia began to lift rates in October last year, and is expected to announce another quarter-percentage point rise on Tuesday. Taiwan and South Korea could start to nudge up rates before the end of this quarter.
By contrast, recovery in the United States and Europe is still tepid, meaning that no rate increases are expected until late this year.

Abstract: Nonetheless, Ford offered a number of specific proposals in his speech, some of which may sound familiar to those who listened to President Obama's address on Wednesday: capping the federal budget at $300 billion; cutting taxes by giving individuals a rebate of up to $1,000 and by giving industries a $4 billion reward for creating new jobs; imposing new taxes on petroleum products to discourage use and offering new incentives to encourage more domestic production as well as development of nuclear and solar energy.

Full text: IN his first State of the Union speech, on Jan. 15, 1975, President Gerald R. Ford told Congress and the American people in his plain-spoken manner: "I must say to you that the State of the Union is not good." And then he listed the particulars: The economy was suffering from stagflation -- simultaneous high inflation and economic recession. Unemployment was rising toward 8 percent. There was an energy shortage and high oil prices because of an embargo on petroleum shipments by Arab nations. The federal budget deficit was approaching $50 billion and the national debt $500 billion -- big money in those days. As we prepared the speech -- the first draft wasn't even completed until around 3:30 a.m. on the day of the address -- Ford asked Roy Ash, director of the Office of Management and Budget, if he had any good economic news to include. Ash replied, "That'll take about four seconds."
Nonetheless, Ford offered a number of specific proposals in his speech, some of which may sound familiar to those who listened to President Obama's address on Wednesday: capping the federal budget at $300 billion; cutting taxes by giving individuals a rebate of up to $1,000 and by giving industries a $4 billion reward for creating new jobs; imposing new taxes on petroleum products to discourage use and offering new incentives to encourage more domestic production as well as development of nuclear and solar energy.
Ford ended his State of the Union speech by declaring, "In partnership with the American people, we will achieve these objectives." However, Ford's ability to achieve the goals -- as well as his relationship with Congress, the press corps and the American people -- had been seriously undermined by the pardon of his disgraced predecessor, Richard Nixon, four months earlier. When Nixon resigned, Ford seemed to be a breath of fresh air after the miasma of Watergate -- he was a regular guy who could laugh at his own foibles, down-to-earth, self-confident, liked by both Democrats and Republicans in Congress.
All that hope and good will were blown away by the pardon, and by subsequent rumors (never substantiated) of some kind of deal between Ford and Nixon. It was in that atmosphere of anger and disillusionment that Ford delivered his first State of the Union speech. Only decades later was Ford's presidency -- and the pardon -- reappraised and his reputation restored. -- RONALD NESSEN, press secretary for President Gerald Ford

Full text: THINGS were tough as Jimmy Carter prepared for his 1978 State of the Union address, one year into his term. But they seemed, strangely, hopeful. The president's big domestic initiative that year was a national energy policy. The gas-station lines and first-ever spike in fuel prices in the mid-1970s made this a genuine emergency. He hadn't yet gotten the whole plan through, but the previous summer he had signed legislation creating the Department of Energy and begun imposing standards that, even after he was gone, kept improving the fuel efficiency of American cars, buildings and factories.
His big foreign policy initiative was the Panama Canal treaty, to restore Panama's sovereignty over the Canal Zone with safeguards for the canal's operation. Although the opponents were fierce, employing what we would now call "tea party" tactics, they were a minority. Mr. Carter had John Wayne and other tough guys to speak on the treaty's behalf -- not to mention 61 Democratic votes in the Senate and a more than 2-to-1 Democratic majority under Tip O'Neill in the House.
Just before the speech, the president had traveled across four continents in a marathon world tour. Yes, there were glitches, like a toast in Tehran praising the soon-to-be-deposed shah of Iran as "an island of stability" in a troubled area of the world. (I remember -- I wrote it!) But I also know firsthand that President Carter was warmly and admiringly received from India to Brazil for his emphasis on a new foreign policy built on traditional American respect for human rights.
Inflation was going down. Job creation was going up. So as time came to put the speech together, everyone involved dared think about what else the administration could do, after such a good start. "There is all across our land a growing sense of peace and a sense of common purpose," Mr. Carter said in his address -- a sentence I cannot remember writing and in retrospect can hardly believe was uttered at all. "For the first time in a generation we are not haunted by a major international crisis" and therefore have "a rare and precious opportunity to address persistent problems" that otherwise would just get worse. And so he laid out his bright plans, which included making government activities more transparent and reducing the role of lobbyists.
One year tells us something about a presidency and its capacities. But a lot can change after that. --JAMES FALLOWS, chief speechwriter for President Jimmy Carter

Full text: President Obama will send a $3.8 trillion budget to Congress on Monday for the coming fiscal year that would increase financing for education and for civilian research programs by more than 6 percent and provide $25 billion for cash-starved states, even as he seeks to freeze much domestic spending for the rest of his term.
The budget for the 2011 fiscal year, which begins in October, will identify the winners and losers behind Mr. Obama's proposal for a three-year freeze of a portion of the budget. Many programs at the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation and the Energy Department are in line for increases, along with the Census Bureau.
Among the losers would be some public works projects of the Army Corps of Engineers, two historic preservation programs and NASA's mission to return to the Moon, which would be ended as the administration seeks to reorient the space program to use private companies for launchings. Mr. Obama is recycling some proposals from last year, including one to end redundant payments for land restoration at abandoned coal mines; Western lawmakers blocked it in 2009. Mr. Obama will propose a total of $20 billion in such savings for the coming fiscal year.
Exempted from the cuts, however, are national security, veterans programs, Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security -- the most expensive and fastest-growing areas of the budget.
By filling in the details behind the freeze, the administration hopes to show critics that it used a scalpel rather than an ax to keep spending for the targeted domestic agencies to $447 billion through 2013.
The three-year freeze would save $250 billion over the coming decade, assuming the overall spending on the domestic programs is permitted to rise no more than the inflation rate for the remainder of the decade -- an austerity that neither party has ever achieved in Washington. Even so, the $250 billion in savings would be less than 3 percent of the total deficits projected through 2020.
Criticism of the spending plan has ranged from arguments among liberals in Mr. Obama's party and some economists that he should not be cutting spending when the economy needs hundreds of billions of dollars more in stimulus money, to complaints from Republicans that the savings are too paltry when annual trillion-dollar deficits are the largest since World War II.
The debate reflects the conflicting imperatives underlying the administration's fiscal policies -- between the demands to help a struggling economy create jobs and the need for long-term efforts to address the huge buildup of debt that threatens the nation's future prosperity.
"There is a huge tension" between the goals, said Robert D. Reischauer, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office.
Mr. Obama addressed the dueling challenges in his weekly radio and Internet address Saturday.
"As we work to create jobs," he said, "it is critical that we rein in the budget deficits we've been accumulating for far too long -- deficits that won't just burden our children and grandchildren, but could damage our markets, drive up our interest rates and jeopardize our recovery right now."
For the current fiscal year, the administration is working with Congressional Democrats for up to $150 billion more -- on top of roughly $1 trillion in stimulus measures to date -- to spur job creation through more business tax cuts and money for construction projects and provide relief for the long-term unemployed.
At the same time, to hold down annual deficits, the president has proposed the freeze as well as a pay-as-you-go law to require offsetting savings for new spending and tax cuts. He is also calling for new revenue sources, like a proposed tax on big banks to recover any losses from the financial bailout program, and proposing some old ones that Congress has not accepted, including selling emission permits to businesses to reduce pollution.
And for the long term, Mr. Obama will soon issue an executive order for a bipartisan commission to propose a debt reduction plan by December. Democratic leaders have committed in writing that Congress will vote on the panel's package.
As the administration was completing its budget plans in December, Mr. Obama said at a White House economic forum that "we've got about as difficult an economic play as is possible" in adding to the current deficit while simultaneously planning to slash future shortfalls. He compared it to pressing the accelerator while being poised to hit the brakes.
Because deficits would be even worse if the economy relapsed, he said then, "the single most important thing we could do right now for deficit reduction is to spark strong economic growth" so that people have jobs, businesses make profits and the government collects more taxes.
But he acknowledged, as his support in the polls continued to slip, "We're going to have to do a better job of educating the public on that."
The worse-than-expected recession, which has led to even smaller tax collections and higher stimulus spending than planned, has doomed Mr. Obama's promise a year ago to reduce annual deficits by the end of his term to a size equal to 3 percent of the gross domestic product, a level most economists consider sustainable. The projected $1.3 trillion deficit for this year is more than 9 percent of the gross domestic product.
Mr. Obama's budget director, Peter R. Orszag, told business leaders in November that he was now dedicated to getting the deficit to 3 percent by the 2015 fiscal year. But he has also told people that success is contingent on a bipartisan debt commission forcing Congress to increase revenues and reduce future spending on entitlement program benefits -- an outcome that is far from certain at this point, given Republican leaders' resistance to even participating in a commission.
The president's budget also assumes approval of his ambitious plan, now stalled in Congress, to remake the nation's health care system. That would mean significant reductions in the growth of Medicare spending. The White House and Congressional Budget Office agree that the health bill would reduce projected deficits in the long term. But the reductions are relatively small compared with the total deficits projected over the coming decade.
Mr. Obama's 2011 budget would provide more for the Pentagon's Special Operations forces, the Army's Black Hawk and Chinook helicopters, and the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter.
Mr. Obama and Congressional Democratic leaders have said they will extend most of the Bush-era tax cuts scheduled to expire on Dec. 31. The president wants Congress to let the tax cuts lapse for high-income people, so that couples making more than $250,000 would see their taxes rise. But some centrist Democrats are urging Mr. Obama to spare wealthy taxpayers as well, to avoid raising their taxes before the economy is fully recovered.

Abstract: According to Eurostat, the European Union's statistics agency, 44.5 percent of people under 25 in Spain were without work at the end of 2009.

Full text: The Spanish government outlined far-reaching spending cuts on Friday to bring its sizable budget deficit under control, amid forecasts that the country would remain mired in recession for another year.
Broader data released Friday showed the economic recovery in the 15 other countries using the euro would remain sluggish.
Spain has been hit especially hard by a slump in home prices, and is scrambling to avoid the fate of Greece, where a ballooning budget deficit has raised concerns about the government defaulting on its bonds.
The Spanish government said on Friday that it would cut spending by almost 50 billion euros, or $70 billion, to help bring its budget deficit down to 3 percent of gross domestic product by 2013, from 11.4 percent last year. Lowering the deficit to 3 percent would be in line with European Union's limit on national deficits.
Elena Salgado, the finance minister, said the spending cuts would spare only a few areas -- education, antiterrorism, research and development, pension payments and unemployment assistance.
Total spending cuts for public employees will amount to a reduction equivalent to 0.3 percent of G.D.P. through 2013, taking into account reduction measures like hiring freezes. A small wage increase for public employees was negotiated recently.
With its traditional union allies voicing opposition to most of the proposals, the Socialist government is very likely to face strong opposition to the spending cuts. The government has already announced tax increases.
"It is a rigorous plan which we are convinced will allow us to meet our commitments by 2013," said the deputy prime minister, Maria Teresa Fernandez de la Vega, referring to the deficit. .
The government left unchanged its forecast for 2010 of a 0.3 percent contraction. The International Monetary Fund said this week that it expected Spain to be the only country in the euro zone to remain in recession this year. It forecast a contraction of 0.6 percent in 2010, then growth of 0.9 percent in 2011.
The national statistics office in Madrid said Friday that unemployment was 18.8 percent in the fourth quarter, up from 17.9 percent in the previous period. According to Eurostat, the European Union's statistics agency, 44.5 percent of people under 25 in Spain were without work at the end of 2009.
"This quarter we could see further job loss," Ms. Salgado warned.
Until the crisis hit, Spain had experienced a decade of robust expansion and was praised as a European success story, its economy fueled by easy credit and an explosion in home construction.
Financial markets have been focusing on the weak finances of the euro zone's Mediterranean members: Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain. The price of Greek bonds in particular has been sliding as investors lose faith in the ability of the Greek government to service its debt.
While Greece represents about 2.5 percent of euro zone G.D.P., Spain accounts for about 11.5 percent.
"If Greece goes under, that's a problem for the euro zone," Nouriel Roubini, a New York University professor, said at the World Economic Forum at Davos, Switzerland, according to Bloomberg News. "If Spain goes under, it's a disaster."
Separately, the Spanish government proposed gradually increasing the minimum retirement age by two years, to 67, starting in 2013, a process that would be phased in over a decade. The measure has yet to be approved by a cross-party commission; even if it is agreed to by Parliament, it would not affect current retirees, said Ms. Salgado, the finance minister.
Other data released Friday by Eurostat showed that inflation edged higher in much of the Continent in January, although less than had been expected. Unemployment continued its slow climb.
Analysts said the reports suggested a continuation of the muted recovery in the region throughout the year.
"All in all, the euro zone is now approaching Goldilocks territory," where activity is deemed neither too hot nor too cold, said Peter Vanden Houte, an analyst at ING. Growth should be "picking up gradually, while underlying inflationary pressures remain subdued."
Consumer prices in the euro zone rose 1 percent in January from a year earlier, Eurostat said in a preliminary release. Economists had expected a 1.2 percent increase. In December, inflation was 0.9 percent higher. That was still well behind the nearly 3 percent rate in Britain and the United States.
Marco Valli, an economist at UniCredit Research in Milan, said the lower rate in the euro zone partly reflected the strength of the euro against the pound and dollar.
Economists said the smaller increase in the euro zone appeared largely a result of energy prices, which, though softer in recent weeks, remained well above levels of a year ago. The estimate did not contain a monthly comparison or a detailed breakdown, which will be published Feb. 26.
Inflationary pressure in the coming months could increase, analysts said, from higher energy prices and possibly from rising food costs. That effect is likely to be offset, however, by subdued pressure for higher wages and rising unemployment.
Eurostat said the euro zone jobless rate was 10 percent in December, up slightly from 9.9 percent in November.
The November figure had been revised down from an initial estimate of 10 percent. Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast a figure in December of 10.1 percent.
The statistics office said the number of people without jobs rose to 15.8 million in the euro zone, rising by 87,000 in December over November's figure.

Full text: The United States economy grew at its fastest pace in more than six years at the end of 2009, even as businesses resisted hiring and continued to do more with less.
The broadest measure of economic activity, gross domestic product, expanded at an annual rate of 5.7 percent in the fourth quarter, after a 2.2 percent increase the previous quarter.
"It was an excellent report, but it's not clear how sustainable this pace of growth is," said John Ryding, chief economist of RDQ Economics.
The growth rate was the fastest since the third quarter of 2003, when the economy grew at a rate of 6.9 percent. But even 2009's fourth-quarter surge was not enough to overcome a terrible start to the year. The economy finished 2009 with its biggest contraction since 1946, when the country was still cooling off from World War II.
The Obama administration seized on news of the latest upturn as an opportunity to push its proposal to encourage hiring. Companies would receive a tax credit of up to $5,000 for each new hire, and an additional credit on Social Security payroll taxes for raising wages -- by increasing hourly pay or work hours, for example -- in excess of inflation.
"Now's the perfect time for this kind of incentive because the economy is growing, but businesses are still hesitant to start hiring again," President Obama said in Baltimore.
The economy has been able to grow even without adding workers because employers have found ways to accomplish more with fewer workers. Productivity grew at a robust rate of 8.1 percent in the third quarter of 2009, the most recent data available.
The single biggest factor in the strong growth rate last quarter was not consumers buying more, but businesses letting their stockpiles shrink at a slower rate than they had been previously.
For example, a bike company usually keeps its warehouse well stocked. In tough times, it cuts production and sells what it already has in the warehouse.
When its financial worries ease, the company still does not fully replenish its warehouses, but it lets its inventories shrink at a slower pace.
Because of the way the government calculates growth, this business moderation translates into an increase in output. The change in inventories added 3.4 percentage points to the growth rate in the final quarter of 2009.
Those inventory changes alone cannot sustain growth over an extended period of time. Economists are hoping that once business executives become more confident about the recovery, they may increase production to refill their stockroom shelves.
"What goes down wildly has to go up at a pretty good clip," said Robert J. Barbera, chief economist at ITG.
So far, though, final sales to consumers and businesses have been disappointing. Consumer spending grew at an annualized pace of 2 percent in the fourth quarter, after an increase of 2.8 percent in the third quarter. That is better than many had feared when the quarter began, considering the end of the cash-for-clunkers program that had helped stimulate auto spending. Still, in the past, consumption has been a much bigger driver of growth after a recession.
Many analysts foresee tepid growth in the months ahead. Ian Shepherdson, of High Frequency Economics, expects output to expand by just 1 or 2 percent, at an annualized rate, this quarter and next.
The biggest challenge in the near future is the job market.
On net, the economy lost 208,000 nonfarm payroll jobs last quarter, and the unemployment rate rose to 10 percent, from 9.7 percent. As long as the labor market remains weak, consumers -- whose purchases make up the bulk of economic output each quarter -- will be reluctant to spend money. That means businesses will need to look for other sources of demand, like exports.
Perhaps the most promising aspect of Friday's report in terms of jobs was the pickup in equipment and software spending.
Businesses increased their investment in these areas at an annualized rate of 13.3 percent last quarter, compared with an increase of 1.5 percent in the third quarter.
"Businesses that are spending more on equipment and software are probably going to be hiring more as well," said Nigel Gault, chief United States economist for IHS Global Insight. "If we see more hiring, that means we may see more consumer spending, too."
Obama administration officials say they see other signs that output growth will eventually transform into job growth.
"Employers are seeing demand go up," said Christina Romer, the chairwoman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers. "They're starting to hire temporary workers. We're trying to get them to take the plunge and hire permanent workers. And do the hiring sooner rather than later."
Total government spending fell slightly, by an annualized rate of 0.1 percent, from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, largely because of declines in military spending and state and local government spending.
Federal nonmilitary spending rose at an annual rate of 8.1 percent last quarter, after rising 7 percent the previous quarter.
International trade increased last quarter, and exports grew nearly twice as fast as imports, aided by a relatively weak dollar.
The latest measure of the nation's output is a backward-looking figure, providing only clues of where the country may be headed. The number can be subject to major revisions, especially when the economy is at a turning point. The annual growth rate initially reported by the government for the third quarter of 2009 was 3.5 percent, but was later revised to 2.2 percent. The government's final tally of last quarter's output will be released in March.

Full text: A jury ruled on Friday in favor of shareholders who said the French media group Vivendi lied to the public about its shaky finances, setting the stage for a possible distribution of billions of dollars in damages to investors.
The company was found liable, but not its executives, according to the verdict in United States District Court in Manhattan.
The jury deliberated for 14 days before reaching its verdict. Vivendi said it would appeal.
Lawyers for the investors said that the potential payout could total $9.3 billion. Arthur Abbey, one shareholders' lawyer, said he believed the award was the largest securities class-action jury verdict in history, measured by the number of people affected and the dollars involved.
A lawyer for Vivendi said it was impossible at this stage to estimate actual damages because it was not clear how many investors were in the class and who would seek payouts.
Lawyers on both sides said any potential payment was more than a year away.
Thousands of investors from the United States, France, Britain and the Netherlands said Vivendi covered up its troubles in 2001 and 2002 as the onetime public water company grew into a media and communications empire. The company flirted with bankruptcy before reorganizing successfully.
Jean-Marie Messier, who took over the company's top post in 1996, was forced out as chief executive in July 2002, when the company was known as Vivendi Universal.
Defendants in the trial were Vivendi, Mr. Messier and the former chief financial officer, Guillaume Hannezo.
The jury concluded on 57 separate claims that Vivendi was 100 percent responsible for misstatements or omissions that misled shareholders. It concluded that Mr. Messier and Mr. Hannezo were not responsible.
It found that Vivendi acted recklessly rather than knowingly in causing the damages. It also concluded that at times the misstatements or omissions inflated the company's stock by as much as $11 a share.
The amount of money plaintiffs will receive if the verdict stands is based on the jury's calculation of how much the shares were inflated as a result of Vivendi's alleged misdeeds.
Outside court, a Vivendi attorney, Paul Saunders, said the company was disappointed and was focused on its appeal, which he said "we expect to win."
"We feel very good about the appeal," he said, adding that the company would ask the judge within a month to toss out the case entirely.
He said the company was pleased that the jury gave the plaintiffs only half of the rate per share that they were requesting.
"To that extent, this is a partial victory for us," he said.
He said that if the case was not thrown out, it would take at least a year to determine how many people deserved compensation and how much money was at stake.
"We have just really begun to fight," he said. "We are going to challenge everything we can challenge."
Mr. Saunders said the company would challenge on appeal whether the court had proper jurisdiction over a foreign company, whether it was proper to calculate damages by estimating the amount of inflation that resulted to share prices and whether the judge's rulings were wrong during the trial.

Abstract: After a week in which top White House officials and Mr. Bernanke met with Democratic leaders in the Senate to secure support, the Senate first voted 77 to 23 to end debate, with more than the 60 votes needed to overcome the threat of a filibuster.

Full text: The Senate gave Ben S. Bernanke a second four-year term as the head of the Federal Reserve on Thursday after critics excoriated the central bank's conduct in the years leading up to the financial crisis.
The 70-to-30 vote was the weakest endorsement ever extended to a chairman in the Fed's 96-year history.
The confirmation was a victory for President Obama, who had called Mr. Bernanke an architect of the recovery, but also signaled the extent to which the Fed, once little known to the public, has become the object of outrage over high unemployment and bank bailouts.
In several hours of debate, senators said that the Fed had abetted, then ignored, the housing and credit bubbles and allowed banks to keep dangerously low capital reserves and to make reckless lending decisions that ruined consumers. Some even blamed Mr. Bernanke for the falling dollar and questioned his commitment to free enterprise.
In contrast, Mr. Bernanke's supporters were muted. They reiterated that the Fed had made mistakes but said that Mr. Bernanke had helped save the economy from a far worse recession.
After a week in which top White House officials and Mr. Bernanke met with Democratic leaders in the Senate to secure support, the Senate first voted 77 to 23 to end debate, with more than the 60 votes needed to overcome the threat of a filibuster.
On a second vote, to confirm, the 30 dissents came from 18 Republicans, 11 Democrats and one independent, Bernard Sanders of Vermont.
On Thursday evening, Mr. Obama congratulated Mr. Bernanke in a statement. "As the nation continues to face the consequences of the worst recession in a generation, Ben Bernanke has provided wisdom and steady leadership in the midst of the financial and economic crisis," he said.
While an arm-twisting campaign by the administration limited the opposition, the outcry against the Fed will most likely continue rippling through economic policy generally, and Mr. Bernanke's leadership of the Fed in particular. The effects could be felt first in the debate over how to reform financial regulations. The Obama administration has proposed consolidating risk regulation under the Fed, while some in Congress want to strip away its oversight authority.
"The institutional prestige of the Fed, even apart from this vote, had taken a hit, and it started back around the disaster of September 2008," said Stephen H. Axilrod, who worked at the Fed for 34 years and wrote a history of its monetary policies. "I don't think it has recovered. This is a low point in the Fed's recent history, that's for sure."
The vote also made clear Congress's insistence on transparency from a historically secretive institution that has made extraordinary interventions in the market since 2008.
"The Fed is going to have to work hard, for a long period, to regain the public confidence of the sort it enjoyed during the halcyon days when everything was going so swimmingly," said Barry Eichengreen, professor of economics and political science at the University of California, Berkeley.
Senators from opposite ends of the spectrum formed unlikely alliances. After Mr. Sanders, who calls himself a socialist, finished denouncing Mr. Bernanke, Jeff Sessions, a conservative Republican from Alabama, rose to do the same.
Another Alabaman, Richard C. Shelby, the top Republican on the banking committee, which approved the nomination last month by a 16-to-7 vote, laid out a bill of particulars, saying Mr. Bernanke's handling of the financial crisis did not make up for his failings before that time.
"Considerable economic devastation occurred as a result of Chairman Bernanke's loose monetary policy and weak regulatory oversight," Mr. Shelby said. "If we don't hold Chairman Bernanke accountable, what precedent are we setting for future regulators?"
To an extent, the rhetoric against Mr. Bernanke reflected a spilling-over of frustration at two of his collaborators: the former Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., and the current one, Timothy F. Geithner.
And looming over it all was the role of Mr. Bernanke's predecessor, Alan Greenspan, whose once-sterling reputation has been diminished as his decisions to keep interest rates low after the 2001 recession have been brought into question.
Mr. Bernanke, 56, was a member of the Fed's board for part of that period, from 2002 to 2005, when President George W. Bush named him to lead his Council of Economic Advisers. He rejoined the Fed, as chairman, in 2006, and Mr. Obama renominated him last year. Mr. Bernanke is a Republican economist and an authority on the Depression.
"I knew that he would continue the legacy of Alan Greenspan, and I was right," said Senator Jim Bunning, Republican of Kentucky, who was the lone vote against Mr. Bernanke in 2005.
Mr. Bunning cited a half-dozen statements from 2007 to 2009 in which Mr. Bernanke expressed optimism about the housing market, bank capital ratios, the capitalization of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the unemployment rate. Saying that Mr. Bernanke had been repeatedly wrong, he declared, "We shouldn't be paying the Fed chairman to learn on the job."
Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, echoed that, saying Mr. Bernanke had shown "a troubling pattern of false confidence." Senator Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon, went further, saying the Fed had "helped set the fire that destroyed our economy."
While less passionate, supporters of Mr. Bernanke said he had acted deftly and decisively, at least since the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008.
"He basically allowed the Fed to become the lender of the nation," said Senator Judd Gregg, Republican of New Hampshire. "Nobody had ever done that. The way he did it was extraordinary in its creativity, and the results were that the country's financial system did not collapse."
The last time any nominee for chairman faced such opposition was 1983, when the Senate confirmed Paul A. Volcker to a second term on an 84-to-16 vote. Mr. Volcker, too, had served under presidents of opposing parties and had navigated the Fed through a difficult recession.
But while Mr. Volcker sharply raised interest rates to tame runaway inflation -- actions that were initially unpopular but were later praised -- Mr. Bernanke faces a different challenge. The Fed has held short-term interest rates near zero since December 2008, a policy reaffirmed on Wednesday. And while analysts expect rates to start rising later this year, the scale and timing of that rise will be a challenge. So, too, will be the unwinding of the Fed's emergency lending programs and its purchase of $1.25 trillion in mortgage-backed securities.
Many politicians will not want the Fed to put the brakes on recovery by raising rates. Indeed, the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, offered only a lukewarm endorsement last week after telling Mr. Bernanke that the Fed must do more to ease lending to households and small businesses. While the Fed says Mr. Bernanke gave Mr. Reid no specific commitments, the central bank will continue to face close scrutiny.
"Their independence from political pressures has been tarnished," Mr. Axilrod said. "And if the market believes the Fed will not control inflation, there will be more inflation."

Full text: In and of themselves, the economic initiatives announced this week by the Obama administration are not objectionable.
One is a modest package of tax credits and other subsidies intended to help middle-class Americans with some big expenses, like day care, student-loan payments and retirement savings. The other, intended to signal President Obama's willingness to cut the budget deficit, calls for a three-year spending freeze in many discretionary domestic programs, and for increases no greater than inflation after that. The freeze would apply to lower priority programs in a sliver of the overall budget, while spending on administration priorities -- like education and environment -- would continue to grow.
The freeze would have a relatively small effect on spending -- about $10 billion less in 2011 out of about $500 billion in programs. It would be foolish to cut any more deeply when the economy is still so troubled. The real value of the freeze would lie in Mr. Obama's ability to use it politically -- say by trading this deficit reduction for lawmakers' votes on a jobs bill this year.
The problem with the initiatives is that even if they work as planned, Americans need much more. They need leadership that is more inspired and an agenda that is bigger and more detailed than these ideas. The country desperately needs bold moves, starting with the State of the Union address Wednesday night.
The Obama administration has done some important things. Without last year's stimulus package, the economy would be in a far weaker state. Health care reform would be good for the economy and the budget, if it can be saved.
But there's a crater in the economy where the job market used to be, a hole so deep that it would take at least 10 million new jobs to fill it. There are more than six jobless workers for every job opening, which means prolonged spells of unemployment for many of the nation's 15.3 million jobless workers.
A lack of jobs also means delays in getting hired or lower entry-level wages for millions of high school and college graduates -- long-lasting setbacks. It portends little to no wage gains well into the future for millions of underemployed Americans, and even for the majority who have held on to their jobs as the economy has tanked. It means intractable budget deficits -- because without new jobs, economic performance and tax revenues will remain inadequate.
Mr. Obama owes the country an unflinching assessment of the dire job situation and a plan for fixing it that starts with a commitment to lead the effort himself. If he leaves it up to Congress, lawmakers are unlikely to deliver. Even the $154 billion jobs bill passed by the House in December is only a starting point for the repair and recovery work that needs to be done.
To create jobs, Mr. Obama must make it clear that he will not abandon the states at this time of budget crises. Bolstered aid to states is unpopular. But it is among the surest ways to preserve and create jobs because the money is pushed through quickly to employees, contractors and beneficiaries. The alternative is recovery-killing spending cuts and tax increases on the state level.
Mr. Obama also must champion increased small business lending and direct creation of both skilled and low-skilled jobs. He must embrace ways to pay for initiatives, such as redeploying money from the bank bailout or endorsing a financial-transactions tax on Wall Street.
The danger is that the initiatives announced so far this week will move to center stage, eclipsing more difficult and more important needs. It is Mr. Obama's job to make sure that does not happen.

Shares End Lower After Early Gains

Full text: Stocks erased gains in the session's final hour as concerns that the Federal Reserve may signal more plans to unwind stimulus measures overshadowed higher-than-estimated earnings and consumer confidence.
JPMorgan Chase slid 2 percent, leading declines in the Dow Jones industrial average. Verizon Communications tumbled 1.7 percent after it reported revenue that trailed estimates, while the United States Steel Corporation fell 11.8 percent on a wider-than-estimated loss.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slipped 0.42 percent, or 4.61 points, to 1,092.17. The Dow fell 2.57 points, or 0.03 percent, to 10,194.29. The Nasdaq dropped 7.07 points, or 0.32 percent, to 2,203.73.
"We have the Fed meeting today and tomorrow, and this may be hesitation with investors before we know what the indications will be from the policy committee," said Jason Cooper, of 1st Source Investment Advisors in South Bend, Ind.
The benchmark indexes advanced earlier after the Conference Board's confidence index increased more than estimated, to 55.9, as the labor market improved, while companies like Apple and Travelers posted earnings that topped estimates.
The S.& P. 500, which closed at a 15-month high on Jan. 19, has slumped 5.1 percent in its biggest three-day drop in 10 months. The move erased the index's gain for the year.
Fed policy makers, who started a meeting in Washington on Tuesday, are expected to keep the benchmark for short-term interest rates in the zero to 0.25 percent range, where it has been since December 2008. Investors' focus has been on how and when the central bank will signal its intention to start raising rates, and to dismantle the programs by which it has financed risky assets for the banking system.
Financial companies in the S.& P. 500 led the market's retreat, falling 1.7 percent as a group after rising as much as 1 percent earlier. JPMorgan fell to $38.44.
Verizon reported fourth-quarter revenue that trailed analysts' estimates as rising unemployment hurt sales to business customers, and shares fell to $30.17.
Analysts have estimated that a nine-quarter earnings slump for S.& P. 500 companies ended in the fourth quarter. More than 130 companies in the index are scheduled to report results this week.
Per-share earnings for the S.& P. are estimated at $16.47, based on reports from 119 companies, according to Bloomberg data. That is higher than any quarterly total since the second quarter of 2008, according to Standard & Poor's. The figure compares with a full-quarter projection of $16.33 based on analyst estimates for individual companies, according to Standard & Poor's.
About three-quarters of the companies that have reported fourth-quarter results have beaten analyst estimates for per-share earnings, according to Bloomberg data.
"The market's focus is shifting back to the fundamentals of companies, and frankly they're not that bad," said Warren Koontz, chief investment officer for large-cap value stocks at Loomis Sayles in Boston.
Apple gained 1.4 percent to $205.94 after earnings jumped 50 percent on record sales of Macintosh computers and iPhones. Apple reported first-quarter earnings excluding some items of $3.67 a share, 6.1 percent more than the average analyst forecast in a Bloomberg survey.
Travelers, the insurance giant, climbed 2.7 percent, to $50.23, after it reported operating income, which excludes some investment results, of $2.12 a share, compared with the $1.48 average estimate of 18 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
"We're fully in the midst of an economic recovery right now," said Chris Hensen of MFC Global Investment Management in Toronto. "It's healthy to bring the market down to valuation levels that people might be a little more comfortable with."
The International Monetary Fund, meanwhile on Tuesday, raised its forecast for global economic growth this year, to 3.9 percent, from a 3.1 percent projection in October. The fund predicted growth of 2.7 percent in the United States and 10 percent in China. Still, high unemployment and rising public debt will restrain growth and contain inflation, the I.M.F. said.
The Treasury's 10-year note rose 2/32, to 98. The yield fell to 3.62 percent, from 3.63 percent late Monday.
Following are the results of Tuesday's Treasury auctions of four-week bills and two-year notes:

Obama to Seek Spending Freeze To Trim Deficits

Abstract: The initiative holds political risks as well as potential benefits. Because Mr. Obama plans to exempt military spending while leaving many popular domestic programs vulnerable, his move is certain to further anger liberals in his party and senior Democrats in Congress, who are already upset by the possible collapse of health care legislation and the troop buildup in Afghanistan, among other things.

Full text: President Obama will call for a three-year freeze in spending on many domestic programs, and for increases no greater than inflation after that, an initiative intended to signal his seriousness about cutting the budget deficit, administration officials said Monday.
The officials said the proposal would be a major component both of Mr. Obama's State of the Union address on Wednesday and of the budget he will send to Congress on Monday for the fiscal year that begins in October.
The freeze would cover the agencies and programs for which Congress allocates specific budgets each year, including air traffic control, farm subsidies, education, nutrition and national parks.
But it would exempt security-related budgets for the Pentagon, foreign aid, the Veterans Administration and homeland security, as well as the entitlement programs that make up the biggest and fastest-growing part of the federal budget: Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.
The payoff in budget savings would be small relative to the deficit: The estimated $250 billion in savings over 10 years would be less than 3 percent of the roughly $9 trillion in additional deficits the government is expected to accumulate over that time.
The initiative holds political risks as well as potential benefits. Because Mr. Obama plans to exempt military spending while leaving many popular domestic programs vulnerable, his move is certain to further anger liberals in his party and senior Democrats in Congress, who are already upset by the possible collapse of health care legislation and the troop buildup in Afghanistan, among other things.
Fiscally conservative Democrats in the House and Senate have urged Mr. Obama to support a freeze, and it would suggest to voters, Wall Street and other nations that the president is willing to make tough decisions at a time when the deficit and the national debt, in the view of many economists, have reached levels that undermine the nation's long-term prosperity. Perceptions that government spending is out of control have contributed to Mr. Obama's loss of support among independent voters, and concern about the government's fiscal health could put upward pressure on the interest rates the United States has to pay to borrow money from investors and nations, especially China, that have been financing Washington's budget deficit.
Republicans were quick to mock the freeze proposal. "Given Washington Democrats' unprecedented spending binge, this is like announcing you're going on a diet after winning a pie-eating contest," said Michael Steel, a spokesman for the House Republican leader, Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio.
The spending reductions that would be required would have to be agreed to by Congress, and it is not clear how much support Mr. Obama will get in an election year when the political appeal of greater fiscal responsibility will be vying with the pressure to provide voters with more and better services. The administration officials said the part of the budget they have singled out -- $447 billion in domestic programs -- amounts to a relatively small share, about one-eighth, of the overall federal budget.
But given the raft of agencies and programs within that slice, the reductions will mean painful reductions that will be fought by numerous lobbies and constituent groups. And not all programs will be frozen, the administration officials said; many will be cut well below a freeze or eliminated to provide increases for programs that are higher priorities for the administration in areas like education, energy, the environment and health.
The balancing act of picking winners and losers was evident on Monday at the White House. Mr. Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. outlined a number of new proposals that will be in the budget to help the middle class. They cover issues including child care, student loans and retirement savings.
Administration officials also are working with Congress on roughly $150 billion in additional stimulus spending and tax cuts to spur job creation. But much of that spending would be authorized in the current fiscal year, the officials said, so it would not be affected by the proposed freeze that would take effect in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.
It is the growth in the so-called entitlement programs -- Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security -- that is the major factor behind projections of unsustainably high deficits, because of rapidly rising health costs and an aging population.
But one administration official said that limiting the much smaller discretionary domestic budget would have symbolic value. That spending includes lawmakers' earmarks for parochial projects, and only when the public believes such perceived waste is being wrung out will they be willing to consider reductions in popular entitlement programs, the official said.
"By helping to create a new atmosphere of fiscal discipline, it can actually also feed into debates over other components of the budget," the official said, briefing reporters on the condition of anonymity.
The administration officials did not identify which programs Mr. Obama would cut or eliminate, but said that information would be in the budget he submits next week. For the coming fiscal year, the reductions would be $10 billion to $15 billion, they said. Last year Mr. Obama proposed to cut a similar amount -- $11.5 billion -- and Congress approved about three-fifths of that, the officials said.
The federal government's discretionary domestic spending has grown about 5 percent on average since 1993, according to the administration. It spiked to about 27 percent from 2008 to 2009, however, because of the recession. The sudden increase reflected both the first outlays from the $787 billion stimulus package as well as automatic spending for unemployment compensation and food stamps that is triggered during an economic downturn.
The freeze that Mr. Obama will propose for the fiscal years 2011 through 2013 actually means a cut in real terms, since the affected spending would not keep pace with inflation.
According to the administration, by 2015 that share of the federal budget will be at its lowest level in a half-century relative to the size of the economy.
"A lot of our caucus won't like it but I don't think we have any choice," said an adviser to Congressional Democratic leaders, who would only speak on condition of anonymity about internal party deliberations. "After Massachusetts and all the polls about independents' abandoning us for being fiscally irresponsible, we can't afford to be spending more than Obama."
While the Democrats' unexpected loss of a Massachusetts Senate seat in a special election last week gave new impetus to administration efforts to tackle the deficit, those efforts actually have been under way since last fall, when officials began early work on the 2011 budget.
Mr. Obama's budget director, Peter R. Orszag, initially directed Cabinet secretaries and agency heads to propose alternative budgets -- one with a freeze and another that cut spending by 5 percent. Months of internal arguments and appeals followed.

Full text: and suddenly it's not clear whether the Senate will confirm Ben Bernanke for a second term as Federal Reserve chairman. That's not as strange as it sounds: Washington has suddenly noticed public rage over economic policies that bailed out big banks but failed to create jobs. And Mr. Bernanke has become a symbol of those policies.
Where do I stand? I deeply admire Mr. Bernanke, both as an economist and for his response to the financial crisis. (Full disclosure: before going to the Fed he headed Princeton's economics department, and hired me for my current position there.) Yet his critics have a strong case. In the end, I favor his reappointment, but only because rejecting him could make the Fed's policies worse, not better.
How did we get to the point where that's the most I can say?
Mr. Bernanke is a superb research economist. And from the spring of 2008 to the spring of 2009 his academic expertise and his policy role meshed perfectly, as he used aggressive, unorthodox tactics to head off a second Great Depression.
Unfortunately, that's not the whole story. Before the crisis struck, Mr. Bernanke was very much a conventional, mainstream Fed official, sharing fully in the institution's complacency. Worse, after the acute phase of the crisis ended he slipped right back into that mainstream. Once again, the Fed is dangerously complacent -- and once again, Mr. Bernanke seems to share that complacency.
Consider two issues: financial reform and unemployment.
Back in July, Mr. Bernanke spoke out against a key reform proposal: the creation of a new consumer financial protection agency. He urged Congress to maintain the current situation, in which protection of consumers from unfair financial practices is the Fed's responsibility.
But here's the thing: During the run-up to the crisis, as financial abuses proliferated, the Fed did nothing. In particular, it ignored warnings about subprime lending. So it was striking that in his testimony Mr. Bernanke didn't acknowledge that failure, didn't explain why it happened, and gave no reason to believe that the Fed would behave differently in the future. His message boiled down to "We know what we're doing -- trust us."
As I said, the Fed has returned to a dangerous complacency.
And then there's unemployment. The economy may not have collapsed, but it's in terrible shape, with job-seekers outnumbering job openings six to one. Nor does Mr. Bernanke expect any quick improvement: last month, while predicting that unemployment will fall, he conceded that the rate of decline will be "slower than we would like." So what does he propose doing to create jobs?
Nothing. Mr. Bernanke has offered no hint that he feels the need to adopt policies that might bring unemployment down faster. Instead, he has responded to suggestions for further Fed action with boilerplate about "the anchoring of inflation expectations." It's harsh but true to say that he's acting as if it's Mission Accomplished now that the big banks have been rescued.
What happened here? My sense is that Mr. Bernanke, like so many people who work closely with the financial sector, has ended up seeing the world through bankers' eyes. The same can be said about Timothy Geithner, the Treasury secretary, and Larry Summers, the Obama administration's top economist. But they're not up before the Senate, while Mr. Bernanke is.
Given that, why not reject Mr. Bernanke? There are other people with the intellectual heft and policy savvy to take on his role: among the possible choices would be my Princeton colleague Alan Blinder, a former Fed vice chairman, and Janet Yellen, the president of the San Francisco Fed.
But -- and here comes my defense of a Bernanke reappointment -- any good alternative for the position would face a bruising fight in the Senate. And choosing a bad alternative would have truly dire consequences for the economy.
Furthermore, policy decisions at the Fed are made by committee vote. And while Mr. Bernanke seems insufficiently concerned about unemployment and too concerned about inflation, many of his colleagues are worse. Replacing him with someone less established, with less ability to sway the internal discussion, could end up strengthening the hands of the inflation hawks and doing even more damage to job creation.
That's not a ringing endorsement, but it's the best I can do.
If Mr. Bernanke is reappointed, he and his colleagues need to realize that what they consider a policy success is actually a policy failure. We have avoided a second Great Depression, but we are facing mass unemployment -- unemployment that will blight the lives of millions of Americans -- for years to come. And it's the Fed's responsibility to do all it can to end that blight.

Full text: Brace yourself for another wild ride on Wall Street.
Worries about the strength of the global recovery and proposals from Washington to clamp down on banks have sent fresh jitters through financial markets, prompting chatter among traders that stocks could be poised for that rare but alarming phenomenon: a correction.
Such a development would mean a 10 percent or greater sell-off in everything from high-powered Nasdaq technology shares to bread-and-butter Dow industrials.
Over three tense days last week, stocks tumbled nearly 5 percent; the Dow posted triple-digit losses on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, ending the week at its lowest level since November.
Some analysts believe the downward momentum may continue. They say the ingredients are there: a spike in volatility (up 55 percent in the three-day period last week, according to one gauge); activism from Washington (the Obama administration's crusade against risky banks and uncertainty over the future of the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke); and concerns over the slow pace of a global recovery (worries of a default in Greece and inflation in China).
"A confluence of all those headwinds creates a perfect storm of uncertainty on a market that had already been a bit vulnerable to a pullback," said Quincy M. Krosby, a market strategist at Prudential Financial.
"But obviously the question is," she added, "is this going to be something more than a normal healthy pullback?"
A severe decline in the market is far from assured. There are no certainties on Wall Street, and stocks have been known to bounce back after similarly turbulent periods.
At the same time, investors say the discrepancy between the gung-ho stock market and the ho-hum economic recovery is a sign that some sort of adjustment is under way. The energy of the rally in 2009, when the major indexes surged more than 20 percent, is waning, analysts say, and disappointments in the labor market and elsewhere suggest stocks may be out of step with economic reality.
For months, as trading has been heavy and volatile, analysts have warned that a correction was coming; so far, they have been wrong. The first threat came in June and July, when the Dow declined 7.4 percent. In October, talk of a downturn surfaced again when the Dow tumbled 4 percent over seven days of ups and downs. Last week, a volatility gauge rose by the largest amount since 2007, and trading volume was again heavy.
Further uncertainty about the economic outlook, coupled with a political clampdown on banks, could lead frightened fund managers to set off a chain reaction as they lock in profits from the 2009 rally, some analysts say.
"The panic comes in, and the selling takes over," said Ryan Detrick, a strategist for Schaeffer's Investment Research.
Mr. Detrick and other investors look positively on corrections for several reasons. In the eyes of traders, the risk of a long-lasting market downturn in the future decreases when stocks are in sync with economic conditions. Corrections also "clear out the weaker hands," as a Wall Street adage puts it, letting fearful traders make an exit so more eager buyers can move in.
"Once all those people get out of the way," Mr. Detrick said, "the bull market can continue and the uptrend can continue."
In the near term, an unusual degree of uncertainty may bring more losses to the stock market.
President Obama's proposals, on top of rumblings in Congress to tax bonuses and curb banker pay, took Wall Street by surprise and stoked fears that the president might face new political pressure to toughen his stance on big banks.
And lawmakers' skeptical comments about Mr. Bernanke's performance as Fed chairman, ahead of a Senate vote on his reconfirmation, stirred so much unease in the market on Friday that the White House issued a statement over the weekend reiterating the president's confidence that Mr. Bernanke would be confirmed.
In response, financial stocks, which investors consider a possible driver of growth in 2010, fell more than 3 percent on Friday, bringing their declines to about 5 percent for the week.
Investors have been unnerved by the Chinese government's efforts to prevent bubbles from developing in the real estate and stock markets. Hints that banks may slow lending set off alarms late last week, and analysts said it was becoming increasingly hard to gauge how swiftly Chinese officials and those of other developing nations would move to pre-empt inflation, which could slow the global recovery.
"The next few months will be dominated by finding a balance between controlling inflation and maintaining growth," said David Riedel, president of Riedel Research Group, which provides market analysis. "Countries have to use fairly blunt instruments around particular concerns about inflation, and that creates a lot of noise and a lot of uncertainty in markets."
Complicating the picture are high expectations on Wall Street for earnings season. As companies release fourth-quarter results, investors are looking for signs that businesses have moved beyond cost-cutting and found ways to increase revenues.
So far, investors have shrugged off even stunning positive results. Shares of Google, for instance, declined 5.66 percent on Friday, even after the company reported its strongest revenue growth in a year. American Express tumbled 8.47 percent after it said its earnings tripled.
As more companies disclose their earnings this week, investors expect skepticism to linger, potentially feeding greater volatility in major stock markets.
A clearer sense of market sentiment may come this week with the release of data on the frail American housing sector and a report on fourth-quarter economic output. Expectations are restrained. Still, even meeting predictions may not be enough to ward off trouble for stocks.
"We've come a long way in a short period of time," said Howard Silverblatt, an analyst with Standard & Poor's. "You can't keep winning. You need retrenchment."

Full text: WITH all eyes on banks and their bonus pools, there is the question of what happens to the bonus money the bankers receive this year. Will they return to flashy spending or invest it more conservatively?
After all, bonus pools are climbing again. Goldman Sachs, the benchmark for bonuses and the target of public ire, disclosed Thursday that its average employee would receive nearly $500,000 in bonus and compensation, up from the $340,600 an employee it paid last year. This figure is fairly misleading, because bonuses are not doled out evenly. Executive assistants will get far less than the average, while star traders will be paid much more.
In past years, the cliche image of bonus season was of a flush banker walking into a Maserati dealership and driving out in his new toy. That type of spending will be more the exception than the rule this year, advisers said, for two reasons -- neither of which has to do with public perception. The first is the need to have cash on hand to cover basic expenses, a lesson learned the hard way in the depths of the financial crisis last year.
The second reason is the uncertainty of bankers over how much of their bonuses they will actually get, and when they will get it. Because most banks have tried to head off criticism of the size of their compensation packages, they have chosen this year to split the bonuses between cash and restricted stock. In some cases, that stock can be forfeited if the executive or his division performs poorly in the future. These so-called "clawback provisions" are making their recipients more conservative -- and the financial planning more difficult.
Shawn A. Rubin, managing director for the wealth management division at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, said this uncertainty had his clients thinking long and hard about what to do with their bonuses. "There are even more questions when something is clawback-able, as it were," he said. "How do you plan for something you might not get?"
This question is at the center of the changing conversation advisers are having with their clients. They say their clients are focused on three areas: current needs, safe investments and managing for uncertainty. While the numbers at stake are bigger than the average investor has to worry about, the lessons to be learned can be applied at both ends of the scale.
NEEDS If there was one thing last year's economy taught seemingly savvy financiers, it was the importance of having money on hand to pay the bills. The memory of selling securities to cover expenses -- mortgages, school fees, general daily life costs -- is fresh in many bankers' minds and has influenced how much money they are allocating to low-yielding but safe investments.
"Clients are going to be a little more cautious with overspending," said Christopher Zander, a partner at Evercore Wealth Management. "With the cash portion of their bonus, they need to make sure they're allocating a portion to household expenses."
This may seem obvious, but in the frothy years of the boom, many bankers chose to be fully invested and then borrow against those investments to pay current expenses. That way, the thinking went, their investments would continue to grow at a higher rate than the interest on the loans they took out. But then Lehman Brothers collapsed , and it seemed that others might follow. The margin calls on those loans were sudden and unwelcome.
"The feeling now is, 'I'm more concerned about the return of my money than the return on my money,' " said Joseph W. Spada, managing director at Summit Financial Resources in Parsippany, N.J.
So what bankers are doing is putting more of their money in low-yielding money market accounts and less in private equity and hedge funds that have provisions restricting the withdrawal of money. The portion of bank bonuses being paid in restricted stock has the same effect as locking up money in a hedge fund: it is money the bankers may have at some point, but it is not something they can use now. That also means borrowing against it to finance their standard of living is not an option.
SAFETY So what investments are bankers making? For the former masters of the universe, some of the options are decidedly average.
Mr. Spada said he had several clients pay down the principal on their mortgages. In doing so, they guaranteed themselves a return better than most bond portfolios are producing. He cited one financial executive who used his bonus to pay down the $2 million interest-only mortgage on his home. That had the virtue of lowering his monthly payment and bringing him closer to the $1 million threshold to deduct mortgage interest on his taxes. More significant, however, is that by paying down his mortgage, he got a tax-free return equivalent to the 5.5 percent interest rate on his mortgage. To get that return on a taxable bond investment, the client would have to earn 8.46 percent.
Another version of this real estate play is upgrading to a nicer home. "When the money hits their bank and they see it on their screen, you'll see a very short-lived bump in real estate," Mr. Rubin said. "A lot of these guys say having hard assets is better. Having a mortgage against a house is not a bad way for them to be positioned."
Those with a little more risk appetite have been turning to hedge funds that are structured like mutual funds or exchange-traded funds, Mr. Zander said. Those hedge funds allow investors to withdraw their money when they want.
The desire for this more liquid structure is a direct byproduct of the credit squeeze. When hedge funds invoked clauses in their investment agreements that kept investors from taking their money out -- so-called gating provisions -- investors scrambled to raise money from other assets. "After going through this in 2008, individuals are more mindful of liquidity," Mr. Zander said.
UNCERTAINTY Overshadowing all these decisions is the fear of inflation. However much policy makers say inflation will not be a risk for some time, people in financial services are already worrying about it.
William Tedford, executive vice president of Stephens Inc., an investment bank in Little Rock, Ark., predicts that housing prices could hit bottom in the first half of the year and loan demand could pick up. He said he feared that the Federal Reserve would lag behind in increasing interest rates quickly enough to stave off inflation.
To hedge against this, Mr. Tedford is encouraging clients to put 10 to 15 percent of their assets in commodities. "I may be years ahead of worrying about this thing, but the risk is great enough," he said. "I'm beginning to lose a little sleep over it."
Inflation is something bankers are already factoring into how they are investing their bonuses. "They're nervous about so much money in circulation," Mr. Spada said. The antidote is buying gold and commodities through exchange-traded funds.
The paradox here is rich. At the nadir of the financial crisis, gold was the safe haven for people worried the world was ending. Now it could become the asset for those concerned that the government money spent to save that world will end up hurting it down the road.

Full text: China said on Thursday that its economy rose by 10.7 percent in fourth quarter compared with a year ago, as the country continued to surge forward even as many other nations are still trying to punch through the global recession. That was up from a revised growth rate of 9.1 percent in the third quarter.
Over the whole year, the Chinese gross domestic product grew 8.7 percent, surpassing the 8 percent growth-rate benchmark that Chinese leaders assert is necessary to maintain social stability. If China keeps up that growth rate, it will very likely replace Japan as the world's second-largest economy by the end of this year.
The National Bureau of Statistics also announced on Thursday that industrial production in December increased by 18.5 percent and retail sales rose by 17.5 percent. The December consumer price index grew by 1.9 percent and producer price index by 1.7 percent.
The numbers were generally in line with earlier predictions.
Chinese officials are clearly worried about inflation and bubbles, especially in real estate, but the latest economic statistics will no doubt drive the triumphant tone of recent official pronouncements on the Chinese economy.
Much of that commentary has emphasized the contrast between China's relatively successful weathering of the global recession and the severe downturn that still afflicts Western economies, including the United States.
A front-page signed editorial on Jan. 5 in the People's Daily, the official mouthpiece of the Communist Party, praised the party for its far-sighted economic policies and lauded the Chinese economic model.
"When the financial crisis forced the neoliberal economic system into a dead end, the shortcomings of the capitalist system were exposed for all to see," the editorial said. "But a China that was pushed to a crossroads proved its 'national capabilities' in taking on a crisis by answering with the advantage of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics."
Economic numbers released on Thursday also showed China's export industry was still responsible for much of its growth. Some Chinese economists have said China must restructure its economy so that it begins to rely more on domestic consumption and less on exports, which are greatly affected by the overall health of the world economy.
Chinese officials remain concerned about inflation, excessive bank lending and loan defaults. In recent weeks, they have acted on several fronts to address those issues.
On Jan. 7, the central bank raised a key interest rate, the first time it had done so in nearly five months. Five days later, regulators ordered state-owned banks to set aside a larger share of their deposits as reserves against failed loans. Investors and analysts had not expected such a move until the second quarter of this year.
On Wednesday, Bank of China ordered its credit officials to halt any new renminbi loans in an attempt to curb overheated fast lending growth in the first few weeks of this month.
Economists said China would move to further tighten bank lending to confront inflationary fears and swelling asset bubbles.
"The first half of 2010 is likely to be characterized by gradual policy tightening, chiefly through administrative measures," Jing Ulrich, director of the China equities and commodities division of J. P. Morgan in Hong Kong, wrote in a report on Thursday. "Concerns about capital inflows and the health of the export sector will limit the scope for interest rate tightening, but we do expect to see a moderation in new bank loans and the use of reserve requirements to manage the volume of money supply."
Other countries, especially the United States, have also said the artificially low value of the renminbi gives China an unfair advantage in exports, and governments will most likely press China much harder this year to strengthen its currency.

Full text: A day after gliding to 15-month highs, Wall Street stocks had their steepest losses since mid-December on Wednesday as investors fretted over lackluster profits and a slowdown in global lending.
Another slate of disappointing earnings reports sounded an alarm among investors, dragging several sectors -- energy, financial, transportation -- into negative territory. Traders were also startled by indications that China was asking banks to stop issuing loans, and news that the European Central Bank would not help Greece with its debt woes.
Analysts said the fast-paced downturn in stocks, with the Dow Jones industrial average briefly falling more than 200 points, reflected diverging views about the market's recent momentum.
At the close, the Dow had fallen 122.28 points, or 1.14 percent, to 10,603.15, as an afternoon upturn helped pare early losses. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 12.19 points, or 1.06 percent, to 1,138.04. The Nasdaq composite index had the heaviest losses, falling 29.15 points, or 1.26 percent, to 2,291.25.
Some investors say that the gains this year are justified and that they believe the recovery is on track. Others are worried by signs of weakness in fourth-quarter earnings and wondered if the market had gotten ahead of itself.
A result, analysts said, is a tug of war that turns on each fresh data point.
"This is the first time in almost a year and a half there hasn't been a consensus opinion of what this market should do," Randy Cass, founder of First Coverage, said. "2010 hasn't really decided what it wants to be when it grows up."
As investors found safer havens, the dollar strengthened against other currencies, reaching $1.41 against the euro.
Renewed concern that businesses would continue to suffer deep losses helped bring shares down, investors said. Wall Street is in the middle of earnings season, when companies report quarterly results. The results have been mixed, with many firms failing to satisfy Wall Street's demand that they show healthy growth in revenue, not just nimble cost-cutting.
The financial sector, saddled with heavy losses on credit cards and mortgages, continued to disappoint investors on Wednesday.
Morgan Stanleyadded to fears over the vitality of banks when it reported revenue in the fourth quarter of $6.8 billion, or 29 cents in earnings per diluted share. Analysts had expected $7.8 billion in revenue, or 36 cents a share. Shares of Morgan Stanley fell 1.7 percent.
By contrast, shares of Bank of America, which reported a worse-than-expected loss of $5.2 billion but indicated some stability in losses on consumer loans, rose 1.04 percent.
Despite a relatively strong earnings report, investors seemed to be demanding more from the technology sector. I.B.M. fell 2.90 percent on Wednesday, even after the technology giant said its net income was $4.8 billion in the fourth quarter, or $3.59 a share, up 10 percent from the previous year.
There were fears about the pace of the global recovery after Chinese authorities signaled on Wednesday that bank lending would slow significantly as the country tried to check inflation.
The China Banking Regulatory Commission said it expected Chinese banks to extend loans totaling about 7.5 trillion renminbi ($1.1 trillion) -- down nearly 22 percent from the record 9.6 trillion renminbi last year. That prompted concerns that businesses might not have access to enough money to expand and build staffing levels.
In Europe, markets closed down after the European Central Bank policy maker Jurgen Stark said the bank would not give Greece special treatment as the country sought to reduce its deficit.
"Greece knows that it has to catch up on its homework," Mr. Stark said, according to Reuters.
The FTSE 100 in London fell 1.67 percent, and the DAX in Frankfurt tumbled 2.09 percent.
Investors were also concerned by another dreary figure on the United States housing market. The pace of home construction fell 4 percent in December, the government said, during an unusually cold and wet month. Building permits, however, surged to the highest level in a year, indicating future construction would probably be more robust than expected.
Jeffrey A. Hirsch, editor of The Stock Trader's Almanac, said the market was "ripe for a pullback" after ignoring signs of weakness in fourth-quarter earnings reports and disappointing economic figures, including the country's 10 percent unemployment rate.
"The market has been pricing in a pretty robust and unwavering recovery," Mr. Hirsch said. "The sell-off today is the market coming back to the reality that it did get a little bit ahead of itself, and that we're probably going to have some struggles going forward."
Interest rates were lower. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 13/32, to 97 25/32 and the yield fell to 3.65 percent, from 3.70 percent late Tuesday.
Following are the results of Wednesday's Treasury auction of four-week bills:

Full text: The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York warned Wednesday against auditing the Federal Reserve's interest-rate decisions and curbing its regulatory powers, as some in Congress have urged. It was his most detailed defense to date of the central bank's conduct during the financial crisis.
At the same time, the president, William C. Dudley, offered a candid assessment of the failings of regulators.
In a speech to the Partnership for New York City, he conceded that the Fed and other regulators "did not sufficiently understand the importance" of the increased risks that had made the financial system "much more fragile and vulnerable" to panics.
Emergency lending, which the Fed used to pump hundreds of billions of dollars into the economy, was "a blunt and messy solution, employed as a stopgap measure because better alternatives were not available," Mr. Dudley said.
He added: "These actions truly were extraordinary -- well outside the scope of our normal operations, but our judgment was that not taking those actions would have risked a broader collapse of the financial system and a significantly deeper and more protracted recession."
Mr. Dudley's remarks echoed statements by Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, in a report to the Senate Banking Committee last week, and by Paul A. Volcker, a former Fed chairman, in a speech in New York.
Together, the remarks suggested a bolstering of support by former and current Fed officials in the face of Congressional scrutiny.
Some members of Congress are calling for subjecting the Federal Reserve's monetary policy decisions to review by the Government Accountability Office, an arm of Congress, and for consolidating regulation and stripping away some of the Fed's oversight powers.
Mr. Dudley warned that external audits would be seen as "a mechanism to publicly second-guess" the Fed's decisions, and hinder the central bank's role in keeping inflation down while promoting maximum employment.
"Market confidence here and abroad in the Federal Reserve would be undermined," he said. "Asset prices could quickly build in an added risk premium, which might lead to tighter credit conditions."
Mr. Dudley said there were "legitimate questions as to how broad the Federal Reserve's regulatory and supervisory responsibilities should be." He added, "What is fundamentally at issue here is not 'turf,' but rather how we as a nation can best ensure that we never again relive the events of the past few years."
Having learned from the crisis, Mr. Dudley said, the Fed would work to raise capital requirements, toughen liquidity standards and revise compensation guidelines "so that financial-sector employees are rewarded for long-term performance and discouraged from excessive risk-taking."
Trained as an economist, Mr. Dudley joined the New York Fed, the largest and most influential of the 12 Federal Reserve banks, in 2007 after a career at Goldman Sachs. He became president a year ago when his predecessor, Timothy F. Geithner, was named Treasury secretary.
Mr. Geithner has come under intense criticism for his actions as New York Fed president during the financial crisis; he has been summoned to testify before a House committee next week on the New York Fed's bailout of the American International Group, the insurance conglomerate.
Mr. Dudley also urged Congress and regulators to address the problem of financial institutions growing so large -- and taking on so much risk -- that they force the government to step in with a bailout or else risk a broader collapse of markets.
"It is clear that we must develop a truly robust resolution mechanism that allows for the orderly wind-down of a failing institution and that limits the contagion to the broader financial system," he said.

Abstract: The surge indicated that builders are expecting a tax credit for first-time home buyers, which expires on April 30, to help drive demand in the coming months.

Full text: Home construction slowed more than expected in December, the government said on Wednesday, as high unemployment made builders nervous about the demand for new homes. Still, there were signs that future construction might pick up, helped by the lure of a government tax credit.
Builders broke ground on homes at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 557,000 units in December, down 4 percent from November. Economists attributed much of the decline, which was concentrated in single-family homes, to unusually cold and wet weather last month in some regions of the country. They said weak demand from consumers, who remain reluctant to take on mortgages, also played a role.
Analysts expect construction to steadily increase through the first part of 2010. Building permits -- an indicator of future construction -- rose 10.9 percent in December, to an annual rate of 653,000, the highest level in a year. That far outpaced expectations, and it followed a 6.9 percent increase in November.
The surge indicated that builders are expecting a tax credit for first-time home buyers, which expires on April 30, to help drive demand in the coming months.
"We're on the way to recovery," said Patrick Newport, an economist for IHS Global Insight. "We can expect to see sustained increases and the pace picking up over the course of the year."
Yet the market for homes remains extraordinarily feeble. Construction levels are about 75 percent lower than their highs in 2006, prices are deteriorating in many cities and high unemployment will probably continue to temper demand.
Those dreary conditions were underscored when December's data was compared with the previous year: the pace of construction climbed only 0.2 percent.
In December, construction of apartment complexes showed signs of life, climbing 12.2 percent from November, to an annual rate of 101,000. Apartment construction has reached record lows amid a broader crisis in commercial real estate. Builders were struggling to secure loans for large residential projects, which banks consider risky. In addition, demand for rented space has weakened as families move in together to save money.
Assuming the recovery does not falter, home construction is expected to rise as inventories dwindle and consumers grow more confident about making large purchases. The government's credit for first-time home buyers has helped prop up sales, but prices remain stubbornly low.
A separate report released on Wednesday showed that inflation appeared to be tame in the United States. Producer prices increased slightly in December, up 0.2 percent from November, as a drop in energy prices offset a rise in food prices. A measure of prices that excludes volatile food and energy was flat.
Economists generally agree that inflation will not emerge as a serious threat in the near term, but some are concerned about pockets of price increases. Food prices, for instance, were a central contributor to a 4.4 percent rise in producer prices in 2009.
In December, food prices were up 1.4 percent. That increase was probably not a result of unusual weather -- higher prices were mostly in meat and dairy, rather than in fruits and vegetables.
"The current pick-up in headline inflation, although only likely to be temporary, is another drag on real incomes," researchers at Capital Economics wrote in a note on Wednesday.
A report on consumer prices released last week showed a similar pattern: prices on a wide variety of goods were up only slightly in December. Taken together, the reports suggested that the Fed was unlikely to change interest rates anytime soon. It is scheduled to meet next week.

Abstract: Cost disease helps explain why low-income Americans can now afford flat-screen televisions that were out of reach a decade ago, but health insurance that was unaffordable in January 2000 remains unaffordable in January 2010.

Krueger, who is now the assistant Treasury secretary for economic policy, published in the Journal of Economic Perspectives in 2001.

Full text: Nearly everyone agrees that there is something sick about the American health care system, especially when it comes to the seemingly out-of-control rise in costs.
While Democrats and Republicans continue to fight over the remedy, there is one man who can claim to have rendered a specific diagnosis and -- more than 40 years later -- he wants lawmakers and President Obama to know that there probably is no cure.
What afflicts the American health care system (and those of other industrialized nations) is called Baumol's cost disease. It is named for William J. Baumol, an economist at New York University, who turns 88 next month. And it explains why health care costs will almost certainly continue to rise faster than general inflation, and why Democrats might not want to set expectations too high when it comes to their health care bill.
"Let me say first of all that I am a strong supporter of the general notion of the president's health care proposals," Dr. Baumol said in an interview. But he warned that policy makers, including Mr. Obama, were in danger of promising too much.
"One mustn't exaggerate what this program can accomplish," he said, "because if you claim miracles and then prices keep going up two years from now, you have bought yourself some trouble."
Dr. Baumol and a colleague, William G. Bowen, described the cost disease in a 1966 book on the economics of the performing arts. Their point was that some sectors of the economy are burdened by an inexorable rise in labor costs because they tend not to benefit from increased efficiency. As an example, they used a Mozart string quintet composed in 1787: 223 years later, it still requires five musicians and the same amount of time to play.
Despite all sorts of technological advances, health care, like the performing arts, suffers from the cost disease. So do other public services like education, police work and garbage collection. While some industries enjoy sharp increases in productivity (cars can be built faster than ever, retail inventory can be managed better), endeavors like health care are as labor-intensive as ever.
And yet, wages in health care grow to match wage increases in the broader economy. (Imagine trying to pay today's violinist the same as a counterpart in 1787.)
All of this happens invisibly, but the proof is in the budget ledgers of local, state and federal governments. Cost disease helps explain why low-income Americans can now afford flat-screen televisions that were out of reach a decade ago, but health insurance that was unaffordable in January 2000 remains unaffordable in January 2010.
At the same time, demand for health care never lets up. So while slow sales of video games or clothing can reduce prices, health care prices never ease. And while the robots that help build cars have replaced human beings on the assembly line, robots that help out in modern operating rooms are not as economically efficient.
"We do now have robots performing surgery, but the robot is under constant supervision of the surgeon during the process," Dr. Baumol said. "You haven't saved labor. You have done other good things, but it isn't a way of cheapening the process."
Recent research, including a December 2008 study for Centraal Planbureau, the Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis, has found that Baumol's cost disease continues to be a major factor in rising health costs around the world.
Dr. Baumol is no stranger to efforts to overhaul the health system. In 1994, he was briefly tapped to help with the Clinton health care proposal, in part because of his friendship with Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat and chairman of the Finance Committee, who became a major force in dismantling President Bill Clinton's proposal.
Dr. Baumol described his role in 1994, and his relationship with Mr. Moynihan, in an interview with Alan B. Krueger, who is now the assistant Treasury secretary for economic policy, published in the Journal of Economic Perspectives in 2001.
(Mr. Moynihan, who died in 2003, had found a political epiphany in the theory of cost disease. "You have now explained to me why the Democratic Party is called the party of tax and spend, because we are financing all the things that are affected by the cost disease and Republicans want to short-change them," Dr. Baumol quoted the senator as saying.)
In 1994, as now, Dr. Baumol urged officials not to overpromise.
"Most of all, I said, 'Look at what's happened in Europe and Japan,' " he recalled in the 2001 interview. " 'You have virtually every sort of government control: some on doctor's fees, some on cost per visit. In none of the countries have they been able to get costs to rise more slowly than the rate of inflation. You are promising something which will come back to haunt you within the lifetime of this administration.' "
Dr. Baumol said that governments were not the only victims of cost disease. "Just look at what happens to insurance companies, where they are accused of gouging because they are paying for health care," he told Dr. Krueger. "And everybody says we can solve the problem -- make it illegal."
All of this is not to say that efforts to improve the health care system are futile or that costs cannot be slowed.
Economists agree that health care expenses may still rise faster than inflation, but they do not have to rise as fast as they do now, or so much faster in the United States than elsewhere. Patient outcomes could be improved, independent of costs.
"While health care costs are growing throughout the world," Dr. Baumol said, "the level of costs can be very different."
Indeed, Dr. Baumol said that cost disease only underscored the need to help all Americans afford health care.
"No one has found the way to prevent health care costs from growing, so the bottom line is they will grow," he said. "That means that the less affluent of our population are going to need help in being provided with adequate medical care.
"But we can afford it, because we are an economy in which innovation and productivity all continue and continue to rise, and provide us the means with which we can afford to provide health care to the people to whom it is denied today."

Full text: CORRECTION: A picture caption with the Backdrop feature last Sunday about the history of air travel misidentified an Eastern Airlines plane photographed in the 1930s. It was a DC-2, not a DC-3.
Once glamorous, air travel has turned into a slog of security rules, long waits and cramped limbs. This is partly because so many more people fly today. In 1940, passenger planes in the United States carried only 3 million people, compared with 17 million in 1950 and about 650 million in 2008, according to FareCompare.com. Keep in mind, too, that in the early 1980s, shortly after deregulation, many of the cheaper domestic roundtrip tickets sold for $250 to $300, and the same is true today, said Rick Seaney, C.E.O. of FareCompare.com. So, adjusted for inflation, the cost of air travel has actually fallen.

Full text: IS galloping inflation around the corner? Without doubt, the United States is exhibiting some of the classic precursors to out-of-control inflation. But a deeper look suggests that the story is not so simple.
Let's start with first principles. One basic lesson of economics is that prices rise when the government creates an excessive amount of money. In other words, inflation occurs when too much money is chasing too few goods.
A second lesson is that governments resort to rapid monetary growth because they face fiscal problems. When government spending exceeds tax collection, policy makers sometimes turn to their central banks, which essentially print money to cover the budget shortfall.
Those two lessons go a long way toward explaining history's hyperinflations, like those experienced by Germany in the 1920s or by Zimbabwe recently. Is the United States about to go down this route?
To be sure, we have large budget deficits and ample money growth. The federal government's budget deficit was $390 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2010, or about 11 percent of gross domestic product. Such a large deficit was unimaginable just a few years ago.
The Federal Reserve has also been rapidly creating money. The monetary base -- meaning currency plus bank reserves -- is the money-supply measure that the Fed controls most directly. That figure has more than doubled over the last two years.
Yet, despite having the two classic ingredients for high inflation, the United States has experienced only benign price increases. Over the last year, the core Consumer Price Index, excluding food and energy, has risen by less than 2 percent. And long-term interest rates remain relatively low, suggesting that the bond market isn't terribly worried about inflation. What gives?
Part of the answer is that while we have large budget deficits and rapid money growth, one isn't causing the other. Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, has been printing money not to finance President Obama's spending but to rescue the financial system and prop up a weak economy.
Moreover, banks have been happy to hold much of that new money as excess reserves. In normal times when the Fed expands the monetary base, banks lend that money, and other money-supply measures grow in parallel. But these are not normal times. With banks content holding idle cash, the broad measure called M2 (including currency and deposits in checking and savings accounts) has grown in the last two years at an annual rate of only 6 percent.
As the economy recovers, banks may start lending out some of their hoards of reserves. That could lead to faster growth in broader money-supply measures and, eventually, to substantial inflation. But the Fed has the tools it needs to prevent that outcome.
For one, it can sell the large portfolio of mortgage-backed securities and other assets it has accumulated over the last couple of years. When the private purchasers of those assets paid up, they would drain reserves from the banking system.
And as a result of legislative changes in October 2008, the Fed has a new tool: it can pay interest on reserves. With short-term interest rates currently near zero, this tool has been largely irrelevant. But as the economy recovers and interest rates rise, the Fed can increase the interest rate it pays banks to hold reserves as well. Higher interest on reserves would discourage bank lending and prevent the huge expansion in the monetary base from becoming inflationary.
But will Mr. Bernanke and his colleagues make enough use of these instruments when needed? Most likely they will, but there are still several reasons for doubt.
First, a little bit of inflation might not be so bad. Mr. Bernanke and company could decide that letting prices rise and thereby reducing the real cost of borrowing might help stimulate a moribund economy. The trick is getting enough inflation to help the economy recover without losing control of the process. Fine-tuning is hard to do.
Second, the Fed could easily overestimate the economy's potential growth. In light of the large fiscal imbalance over which Mr. Obama is presiding, it's a good bet he will end up raising taxes for most Americans in coming years. Higher tax rates mean reduced work incentives and lower potential output. If the Fed fails to account for this change, it could try to promote more growth than the economy can sustain, causing inflation to rise.
Finally, even if the Fed is committed to low inflation and recognizes the challenges ahead, politics could constrain its policy choices. Raising interest rates to deal with impending inflationary pressures is never popular, and after the recent financial crisis, Mr. Bernanke cannot draw on a boundless reservoir of good will. As the economy recovers, responding quickly and fully to inflation threats may prove hard in the face of public opposition.
Investors snapping up 30-year Treasury bonds paying less than 5 percent are betting that the Fed will keep these inflation risks in check. They are probably right. But because current monetary and fiscal policy is so far outside the bounds of historical norms, it's hard for anyone to be sure. A decade from now, we may look back at today's bond market as the irrational exuberance of this era.

Full text: MONEY market funds are paying investors next to nothing.
More precisely, the 100 biggest funds are now paying 0.05 percent annually, on average, a yield as low as it has ever been, according to Peter G. Crane, the president of Crane Data of Westborough, Mass.
"It's so low it's a joke," Mr. Crane said. "At that yield, it would take more than 1,000 years to double your money."
This microscopic rate of return is part of the continuing fallout of the financial crisis -- a consequence of the very loose monetary policy of the Federal Reserve and other central banks. They have held their benchmark short-term rates at rock-bottom levels while using unorthodox methods, known as "quantitative easing," to restore the health of the global financial system.
There are many indications that this herculean intervention has been working. In the bond market, though short-term interest rates are still hovering near zero, longer-term rates have been on an upward trajectory since late November. In part, this may be a healthy sign, suggesting that the economy is recovering. But it has also created a very unusual situation for financial markets, and it poses some tricky problems for savers, investors and home buyers.
First, how unusual is the current array of interest rates?
William H. Gross, the co-chief investment officer of the Pacific Investment Management Company, or Pimco, the world's biggest bond manager, says the gap between short- and long-term rates has rarely been greater. Translated into the parlance of the bond market, the "yield curve" has seldom been steeper.
"If you go back in history and look not just in the United States but in global fixed-income markets for several centuries," Mr. Gross said, you will rarely find a greater disparity between short- and long-term rates.
For investors, this can create some hard-to-resist temptations.
People who have been holding cash in money market funds or in bank certificates of deposit, for example, may be yearning to buy longer-term bonds instead. United States Treasury bonds with 30-year maturities, for example, yield about 4.5 percent; 10-year Treasuries yield about 3.8 percent. These rates are modest by historical standards but are much more attractive than the negligible yields available in the money markets.
Watch out, though. Liquidating investments that pay almost nothing in order to shift to long-term bonds that pay substantially more may not make sense right now, said Robert F. Auwaerter, the head of fixed-income investing at the Vanguard Group.
"Right now, investors need to be thinking about interest-rate risk," he said. The problem is that interest rates -- at both the short and the long ends of the yield curve -- are likely to rise this year if the economy keeps expanding.
When bond yields rise, their prices fall. The effect is magnified for longer-term securities, so a 30-year Treasury bond would fall in value much more sharply than, say, a six-month Treasury bill. A money market fund would benefit as interest rates rise.
"In this environment, I'd be very careful about buying long-maturity bonds," Mr. Auwaerter said.
On the other hand, homeowners and people looking to refinance mortgages might be advised to move now, rather than wait for the markets to settle further. An increase in mortgage rates, which are closely linked to bond yields, is widely expected this year. Furthermore, the mortgage market has been actively supported by the Fed's $1.25 trillion dollar program to buy asset-backed securities. The Fed has said that it intends to end that program at the end of March, though an extension is possible.
Vanguard estimates that 30-year fixed mortgage rates could rise by a quarter to a half percentage point simply as a result of the end of the Fed program, Mr. Auwaerter said. An additional increase could be expected if bond yields rise further. Mr. Auwaerter and other analysts say long-term yields are expected to keep rising modestly, and for several reasons: inflation expectations are rising, Treasury sales of long-term bonds to finance the deficit are projected to be greater than ever, and Fed purchases of Treasury securities are expected to decline.
The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage was 5.18 percent last week, according to Bankrate.com. It is likely to rise above 6 percent by year-end, Mr. Auwaerter said.
Of course, projecting the direction of interest rates requires a judgment about the economy. At the moment, housing "is a real wild card," said Steven C. Huber, manager of the Strategic Income fund at T. Rowe Price. To prevent the housing market from weakening further, he said, the Fed is likely to unwind its mortgage support program gradually. And he said the Fed was unlikely to raise short-term interest rates until the unemployment rate, now 10 percent, was back in the 9 percent range.
STILL, many analysts project that the Fed will raise its benchmark Fed funds rate, bringing it to perhaps 1 percent by year-end. In the same period, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note may rise well above 4 percent, Mr. Gross said. And because of long-term structural deficits in the United States, he said, Treasuries may underperform the sovereign debt of some other countries, like Germany.
For individuals focused on keeping their investments very safe, it's likely to be a challenging year.
"Basically, savers are going to have to suck it up," said Mr. Crane at Crane Data. "Yields are so low that they're getting almost nothing in return, but this is not a time to play offense. Remember, if you're holding a money market fund or a C.D., you're there because you don't want to lose money. This is not the time to take a lot of risks."

Full text: Stock prices fell sharply on Friday, the worst day of trading this year, as worries over the strength of the American consumer eclipsed a round of mostly positive earnings reports.
On its surface, the news that JPMorgan Chase had doubled its 2009 profits from 2008 might seem reason for elation among investors. But on Friday, Wall Street traders took one look at the results and began to sell.
By the end of trading, the three major indexes were down about 1 percent, with the Dow Jones industrial average falling nearly 101 points. The dollar strengthened, and bond yields fell.
Traders saw promise and peril in JPMorgan Chase's financial report. The bank said it earned $11.7 billion last year and that its profit quadrupled in the fourth quarter, beating expectations. But the firm's chief executive noted that losses on consumer loans remained high and would remain an issue in 2010.
"It does continue to bring up old fears," said James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist for Wells Capital Management.
The Dow Jones industrial average declined 0.94 percent, or 100.90 points, to 10,609.65. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 1.08 percent, or 12.43 points, to 1,136.03. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 1.24 percent, or 28.75 points, to 2,287.99.
For the week, the Dow industrials slipped 0.1 percent, the S.& P. 500 index lost 0.8 percent and the Nasdaq fell 1.3 percent.
All sectors posted losses, with shares of banks leading the retreat. JPMorgan Chase declined 2.26 percent, and Bank of America fell 3.33 percent. Many banks will report earnings next week.
Two weeks into the new year, Wall Street finds itself searching for direction. Over the next few weeks, companies will continue to announce fourth-quarter earnings, and the results are expected to be mostly positive.
Expectations this quarter, however, have shifted, and investors are looking for indications that businesses have moved beyond cost-cutting and have started to bring in revenue.
After the market closed on Thursday, Intel reported a 28 percent increase in revenue and the largest gross profit margin in its history. Overnight, its shares climbed, but they closed down 3.17 percent on Friday.
That seemingly irrational behavior, selling even as a company exceeds expectations, brought an adage to the minds of several investors: "Buy the rumor, sell the news."
"It is an interesting juxtaposition," said Hank B. Smith, chief investment officer for Haverford Investments. "These all beat expectations, but by the time all the news is disseminated, there's concern this may be the peak for profit margins for these companies."
Mr. Smith said he did not believe the worries were valid. But he said Wall Street's negative reaction to the cheery reports could indicate that investors were using the earnings season as a selling opportunity.
"It would be healthy for the market to consolidate and pull back," Mr. Smith said. "It's very normal to have a correction -- defined as 10 percent or more -- in a bull market."
After an energetic rebound in the stock market last year, equities are expected to rise modestly through 2010. The Dow is approaching a psychologically important milestone -- 11,000 points, a level not seen since before the financial crisis -- and the S.& P.'s 500-stock index is nearing 1,150 points.
Economic data released on Friday provided little relief from investors' concerns over profits. A report said manufacturing activity fell slightly in December, and a barometer of consumer sentiment released by the University of Michigan rose slightly this month but fell short of expectations.
Still, there were signs that the near-zero interest rates may remain in place for some time, a boon for stocks. A Labor Department report suggested inflation was largely in check, with consumer prices increasing just 0.1 percent in December.
Interest rates were lower Friday. The Treasury's 10-year note rose 15/32, to 97 16/32, and the yield fell to 3.68 percent from 3. 74 percent late Thursday.
United States markets are closed on Monday for Martin Luther King's Birthday.

Inflation Is Tame, but Spending Power Diminishes

Full text: Inflation in the United States appeared to be largely in check, even as interest rates remain near zero and the government pumps billions of dollars into the economy, a Labor Department report indicated on Friday.
Prices on a wide variety of goods, including airplane tickets and used cars, increased in December. Excluding food and energy prices, which tend to be volatile, the increase was steady at 0.1 percent in December.
Though prices are not rising rapidly, spending power is waning for many Americans: weekly paychecks, adjusted for inflation, fell 1.6 percent last year, the largest decline since 1990.
Adam G. York, an economist at Wells Fargo Securities, said smaller paychecks were likely to persist until the labor market showed signs of improvement. "There's not going to be a lot of room for employees to seek higher wages -- they're struggling to hold onto their jobs," he said.
Over all, prices in the United States are steadily increasing but by small amounts. Compared with December 2008, prices jumped 2.7 percent.
The meager rise in the Consumer Price Index, a broad gauge of inflation, means that Federal Reserve policy makers will probably keep interest rates at their record lows when they meet later this month.
"We don't have to worry about inflation suddenly becoming a big problem," said Nigel Gault, chief United States economist for IHS Global Insight. "It's going to stay quiet."
Consumer prices were higher in December, partly because of a 2.5 percent increase in the cost of used cars and trucks, which economists attributed to a dwindling supply of used cars.
The government's popular cash-for-clunkers program last year resulted in the destruction of hundreds of thousands of vehicles that might have otherwise ended up on a used-car lot. In addition, rental car companies, which typically supply hundreds of thousands of cars to the used vehicle market, have been reluctant to replenish their fleets.
Increases in food and energy prices were also a factor in December. The cost of food rose 0.2 percent as prices climbed for cereals, baked goods, dairy products and fruits and vegetables.
Energy prices were relatively unchanged, with gasoline prices increasing 0.2 percent after a 6.4 percent increase in November.
The weak housing market helped keep prices down. High vacancy rates and excess supply brought low rents to many Americans as realtors competed for customers. In December, rents remained unchanged.
Economists say inflation remains subdued because of high unemployment and large amounts of excess capacity in the economy. Machines sit idle or are running at reduced capacity at many factories across the country.
A separate report by the Federal Reserve on Friday showed that capacity utilization -- a measure of how much of the nation's production capability is in use -- reached 72 percent in December, the highest level in a year. Yet that remained far below the historical average of 80.9.
Over all, industrial production rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.6 percent, the Fed's report said, though that was driven largely by a surge in utility prices during a stretch of cold weather in December.
After growing at a brisk annual rate of 9 percent in the third quarter, the manufacturing sector may be losing some of its momentum. Manufacturing output fell by 0.1 percent in December, the report said. Fourth-quarter growth is expected to come in at a 5.7 percent annual rate, well above estimates for the broader economy's rate of expansion.
"You're going to have a moderate recovery out of a very deep recession," said Daniel J. Meckstroth, chief economist for Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI. "There's so much excess capacity in the industry that there's no constraint to growth, it's just a lack of orders."
Meanwhile, a barometer of consumer sentiment by the University of Michigan showed little change this month. The survey, based on interviews with 500 households, recorded some improvement in how Americans view their finances.

Abstract: For more than two decades, this has been the setting that greeted more than 2,400 wards of the state as they arrive at the Excell Center ranch, a group home for foster boys with histories of violence or mental disabilities.

Full text: In the summer of 2008, a 13-year-old boy from San Francisco emerged from a government van and scanned his new surroundings. Five handsome houses, a small school and an old gymnasium stood on 11 rural acres in the Central Valley that bordered an almond orchard.
Beyond the last house was a soothing panorama of unbounded farmland, interrupted only by old Highway 99 and the big rigs that rumbled across the horizon.
For more than two decades, this has been the setting that greeted more than 2,400 wards of the state as they arrive at the Excell Center ranch, a group home for foster boys with histories of violence or mental disabilities. It is situated just outside Turlock, 40 miles southeast of Stockton.
That the Excell Center, which now houses 52 youths from ages 10 to 18, has survived the die-off of foster homes is partly a matter of real-estate economics: it costs less to house people in the heart of the Central Valley than it does in urban areas, and it costs less to pay workers to take care of them.
The other underlying economic reality, recently confirmed by a panel of federal judges, is that for 18 years, the state's reimbursement for foster care has fallen woefully short of its minimum goals. The combination of the two means foster care in the Bay Area has been hit harder than anywhere else in the state.
In a tale all too familiar in cash-strapped California, the foster care system has been coming apart from inadequate state financing for at least 20 years, officials at the county level say. In the past two months, a succession of key court decisions in favor of care providers lifted hopes that the judicial rulings might finally turn things around, but the lawsuits have simultaneously shed light on a system that has been cut to the bone.
Jill Duerr Berrick, a professor in the School of Social Welfare at the University of California, Berkeley, said that sooner or later the children would suffer.
"The supply and demand problem is so pressing," Professor Berrick said, "that a child services agency is not always capable of finding the type of care that a child needs.
"The decline is going to continue for a while, but at some point state and county officials are going to have ask whether these shifts in care-giving settings are in the child's best interests."
While the teenagers in need still have places to go, these places are farther from their homes and offer fewer services.
From West Oakland to East Los Angeles to townships in the shadow of the Sierras, the neglected or abused boys are taken hundreds of miles to the Excell Center. Statewide, there are now 1,402 homes, down from 1,759 five years ago. During the trial of the federal lawsuit filed on behalf of group homes last year, the state said it paid the facilities 76 percent of their costs.
For foster parents, the math is even more skewed. Regina Deihl, a Half Moon Bay foster parent who filed a similar lawsuit against the state on behalf of individual foster parents, said that with compensation for foster parents covering only 68 percent of the actual cost, there had been nearly a 50 percent drop in the number of licensed foster parents in Santa Clara and San Mateo counties since 1991.
"Kids are being outsourced to the Central Valley," Ms. Deihl said.
In Southern California more than 90 percent of foster care placements were in the child's home county, according to data compiled for the state by the University of California, Berkeley.
It is different in the north. In San Mateo County, the figure was 23.8 percent; in San Francisco it was 36 percent -- not quite 50 of the city's 130 placements. The figures for Contra Costa and Santa Clara Counties were 59.2 percent and 69.7 percent, respectively.
Many officials and experts say the group home's demise is a sign that the state is shifting toward a healthier child-welfare philosophy that favors placement with relatives, whenever possible. State data show that 4,116 children are in group homes, down from a high of more than 6,900 in 2004.
Others, however, worry that the swift disappearance of local providers results in faraway or inappropriate placements that hamper efforts to rehabilitate children with their families. These cases also add to the strains on California's social workers, who already juggle caseloads twice the recommended limit, said Frank J. Mecca, director of the County Welfare Directors Association of California.
Local social-service officials disagree that distant placement is always a problem. Trent Rhorer, San Francisco's head of human services, said his county had no difficulty finding nearby placements for children. Asked about the 64 percent of youths placed out of the city, Mr. Rhorer suggested that the numbers failed to account for San Francisco's small size.
"You have to remember this is a county of seven by seven miles," he said, "so Daly City or Oakland, just across the bridge, are considered 'out-of-county.' "
Across that bridge, Tara Beckman, the deputy director of Alameda County's Court Appointed Special Advocates Program, does not have enough space for wards from her own county. Ms. Beckman said the youths who needed more special services were being placed in homes in other parts of the state.
"There just aren't the placements in Alameda to put them," she said. Alameda's in-county placement rate is 45.6 percent.
Kathy Marsh, a placement supervisor for Contra Costa County, said she had sent children to Redding, Nevada City and Victorville. Those placements severely test her department, as case workers, who are supposed to visit their assigned children once a month, often cut their visits short because they are so busy.
To help one other, some who are visiting distant facilities drop in on children assigned to a co-worker, to save the other person a trip.
"The mileage they put on is just ridiculous," Ms. Marsh said. But with several homes closing in the county every year, she added, it has not been a matter of choice.
"We just don't have programs in-county to meet those needs anymore," she said.
The lack of money affects not just where the children live, but also how much money is spent on clothes and food, and how well workers in those group homes are compensated.
According to the California Alliance of Child and Family Services, which filed the suit on behalf of group homes, the California Necessities Index, a measure of price inflation for goods like food and clothes, has risen by 76 percent since 1990, the last time federal compensation guidelines were drawn. The state has raised its payments by 33 percent in the past 20 years.
The rates set in 1990 also assumed an hourly wage of $5.93 for entry-level child-care workers, 40 percent above the minimum wage of $4.25. The equivalent wage that is supported by state payments today is 22 cents above the state minimum wage of $8 an hour.
In November, a federal judge blocked the state's plan to save $19 million by further cutting payments to group homes by 10 percent, which would have supported an entry-level wage below the state minimum.
"I know the state is in serious straits," said Judge Marilyn H. Patel of Federal District Court, who expressed concern of "injury beyond repair" to children in group homes. "We're talking about children one step away from the criminal justice system."
The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled in December that the California Department of Social Services was in violation of a federal law because it failed to fully compensate group homes.
Despite its location 110 miles from San Francisco, the Excell Center near Turlock has roots in the Bay Area. Its parent organization, Aspiranet, operated 10 homes with 64 beds in San Mateo County in the 1980s. But it struggled to stay afloat, so Vernon M. Brown, Aspiranet's director, moved much of the operation to the Central Valley.
The company thrived. It now employs more than 700 people statewide. Fifty-two boys are at the campus near Turlock.
"You're paying someone $14 an hour in there and $9 an hour out here," said Christopher Essary, who runs the Turlock program. "That's the difference."
As Mr. Essary spoke last month in the living room of one of the tidy homes, the boy from San Francisco, now a slight 15-year-old, ate corn dogs in the kitchen.
Eighteen months ago, when social workers picked the boy up, he left behind a life of clashes in his grandmother's Inner Richmond home, but also carefree moments spent with friends at the Westfield Mall or the Shiekh Shoes store downtown. The day he arrived at his new home, he said, his first thought was "AWOL-ing" -- running away.
He has not acted on the impulse.
"I got used to it," the boy said with a shrug. "We had some fun trips, like to Disneyland."
His grandmother has never visited.

Full text: Little by little, regional economies in the United States are gaining strength, the Federal Reserve said Wednesday, though several pillars -- housing, real estate and the jobs market -- remain weak.
The central bank's report on economic growth across the country, known as the beige book, described "modest" improvement in 10 of the 12 regions in the nation, noting growth in consumer spending and home sales. But the Fed's cautious tone suggested that a recovery would be slow and hesitant.
"Through the ups and downs, this is still a moderate recovery," said James F. O'Sullivan, chief economist for MF Global. "But we're at the point where strength is feeding on itself, and you'll see more strength in six months' time than you'll see now."
The report, based on interviews in December and early January, offered mixed signals on consumer spending, a crucial driver of the economy. While the holiday season brought a rush in sales, retailers in places like San Francisco and Philadelphia said the gains were so small compared with precrisis levels that they were not confident spending had resumed, the report said. The Fed characterized consumers as "cautious, price sensitive, and focused on necessities."
Still, car sales were flat in most regions and increased in some areas, even in the absence of incentives like the government's cash-for-clunkers program.
Home sales also increased in most areas, the report said, in part because of the lure of a government tax credit for first-time buyers. Much of the growth was in lower-priced homes. Over all, home prices remained about the same and residential construction was weak.
Manufacturing, considered a bellwether sector, showed gains in production and employment in many parts of the country. A surge in exports in the last several months helped increase orders for carmakers and semiconductor companies.
Michael E. Feroli, a senior economist for JPMorgan Chase, said a slowdown in inventory liquidation and strong demand for items including cars and soybeans from Asian countries helped rekindle the manufacturing sector.
Mr. Feroli characterized the outlook for manufacturing as "not enthusiastic," but he added, "on balance, it's a little more upbeat."
As the Fed prepares to meet this month to set monetary policy, there seemed to be little in the report to give policy makers reason to raise interest rates from record lows. Economists expect high unemployment and large amounts of excess capacity in the economy to keep inflation in check.
Unemployment remained a central obstacle in many regions. Last month, the jobless rate nationwide held steady at 10 percent as an additional 85,000 positions were lost. Only New York reported a significant increase in hiring, the report said.
Another challenge is persuading consumers and businesses to borrow again. Since the onset of the crisis, Americans have been reluctant to spend freely and are hoarding more of their earnings. The report said demand for loans remained low and weakened in some regions, while loan delinquencies and defaults continued to rise in many areas.
Real estate agents also face dreary conditions. The commercial real estate market, hit hard by a tide of business failures, remains soft, the report said, leaving agents with a large excess supply.
As vacancy rates climbed, real estate companies in New York and Kansas City reported worsening conditions. Analysts say the market will be slow to recover, and they do not predict a rebound this year.
"It's a drag," Mr. O'Sullivan said, "but it doesn't mean the overall economy won't grow."
In the third quarter of 2009, the economy grew at a rate of 2.2 percent. Analysts expect increased spending will help raise that rate closer to 4 or 5 percent for the fourth quarter.

Abstract: The government also took steps to cool speculation in housing, announcing that it would pay special attention to loans given to buyers of second homes. Because the government so far has refused to wield one effective monetary tool -- loosening its control of currency exchange rates -- regulators have been forced to rely on bank reserve limits, changes in interest rates and other indirect measures to save the economy from inflation and overexpansion.

Full text: Chinese regulators ordered state-owned banks on Tuesday to set aside a larger share of their deposits as a reserve against failed loans, another in a string of indicators that Beijing is concerned about speculation in the nation's fast-growing economy.
In a posting on its Web site, the central bank raised the reserve requirement for major banks to 16 percent of assets as of Jan. 18, a half-percent increase from the current rate. Smaller banks would jump to 14 percent, from 13.5 percent.
The requirement, which forces banks to keep more assets internally instead of lending them out, is apparently aimed at curbing a yearlong lending spree by major Chinese banks that has shown few signs of abating.
China's government news service, Xinhua, reported on Tuesday that banks had made loans totaling almost 600 billion renminbi, or $87.7 billion, in the first week of January. At that rate, Chinese banks would lend almost 50 percent more this January than in the month a year ago, when the Beijing government increased spending to bolster an economy staggered by the global financial crisis.
Moreover, Chinese bank lending in the first 11 months of 2009 -- 9.2 trillion renminbi, or about $1.38 trillion -- was twice as much as had been lent the previous year.
"China's banking regulators have been attempting since later last year to prevent another lending glut in 2010, and this policy change reflects that effort," Nicholas Consonery, a China economics specialist at Eurasia Group, a New York-based political risk research firm, said in an e-mail message.
Mr. Consonery said regulators were probably unnerved by the burst of lending early this year, which most likely included many loans that were held up when the government put quotas on some lending at the end of last year.
Even so, he said, it was unclear whether the latest move represented a serious effort to dampen expansion. Though inflation forecasts are rising -- recent private estimates are edging over a 3 percent annual rate -- government officials remain fearful that tightening credit too much will raise the cost of manufacturing, slow China's export-based economy and raise unemployment.
Regulators hope for a twofold effect: to reduce inflation, by taking excess liquidity out of the economy, and to curb the flow of easy cash into China's securities and property markets, where some economist are warning of bubbles.
The new reserve requirements follow other government moves to cool the economy, which appears to have grown by 8 to 9 percent last year and could expand even faster this year. Regulators raised the interest rate on a key interbank loan last week, signaling further increases intended to rein in spending. The government also took steps to cool speculation in housing, announcing that it would pay special attention to loans given to buyers of second homes.
Because the government so far has refused to wield one effective monetary tool -- loosening its control of currency exchange rates -- regulators have been forced to rely on bank reserve limits, changes in interest rates and other indirect measures to save the economy from inflation and overexpansion.
Chinese banks have generally been exceptionally profitable, in part because the rate they pay on consumer deposits is far below the rate they charge for loans. Because they are government-controlled, they have little incentive to compete for consumers' deposits.
The banks' reserve requirements also are considerably more conservative than those of United States financial institutions. As China's growth has picked up this decade, regulators have steadily raised the reserve requirement, including nine times in 2007 alone.
The United States Federal Reserve requires big American banks to withhold about 10 percent of their deposits from the lending market as a safeguard against bad loans -- more than a third less than the reserves held by big Chinese banks.

Full text: As companies began releasing fourth-quarter results on Monday, the question on Wall Street was not so much whether businesses turned a profit but how they did so.
Investors are looking for signs that employers moved beyond heavy cost-cutting and established a steady stream of revenue in the last part of 2009. On Monday, traders seemed cautious about that prospect: stocks searched for direction for much of the day, but a late rally pushed most indexes into positive territory. Oil briefly touched a 15-month high and the dollar weakened.
Expectations for fourth-quarter results are high. Over the last year, many employers have slashed work forces and reined in spending to spruce up earnings. Now, investors are looking for substantial revenue growth and indications that global demand is picking up.
"The hopes are markedly higher," said Quincy M. Krosby, a markets strategist at Prudential Financial. "Investors are also looking at the bigger mosaic and wondering whether six months from now we will be facing a double-dip recession."
The Dow Jones industrial average ended the day 45.80 points, or 0.43 percent, higher at 10,663.99. Disney shares fell 1.63 percent after the company's stock was downgraded by an investment firm, helping to restrain the advance.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 2 points, or 0.17 percent, to 1,146.98. The S.& P. has gained in each of the six trading sessions of the new year, a pattern that last occurred in 1987. (In October of that year, stocks plunged more than 20 percent in the Black Monday crash.)
The technology-dominated Nasdaq fell 4.76 points, or 0.21 percent, to 2,312.41.
Interest rates were steady. The Treasury's 10-year note rose 4/32, to 96 12/32, and the yield fell to 3.82 percent from 3.83 percent late Friday.
Ms. Krosby attributed Monday's lack of direction to a tug of war between high expectations for earnings and concerns about the speed of the broader recovery.
Bill Schultz, chief investment officer for McQueen, Ball & Associates, said investors generally expected that fourth-quarter earnings would be positive. Traders are less certain, he said, that companies will perform well through 2010.
"The key question is, 'How do we get better earnings down the road?' " Mr. Schultz said. "There's no clear signal this economy is faltering and falling into a second dip, and there's no clear signal it is going to take off and improve."
Shares in Asia rose on the news that Chinese imports had reached a record, climbing 56 percent in December. Exports rose 18 percent in the month, after falling slightly in November. Growth in the Chinese economy is considered crucial to a global recovery.
In Asia, the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong was up 0.51 percent, and the Shanghai composite index closed 0.52 percent higher; markets in Japan were closed for a holiday. In Europe, the major indexes in London and Frankfurt ended slightly higher, and the Paris exchange ended slightly lower.
News that China's oil purchases had reached a record briefly sent crude prices to their highest levels since 2008, reaching $83.21 a barrel, before settling at $82.52. At the same time, the dollar weakened against most other currencies, hitting $1.45 against the euro. The ruble had its best day against the dollar in more than a decade, rising 3.1 percent.
Traders are likely to focus on earnings, with few items on the economic calendar this week. Still, investors are not ignoring economic fundamentals, and there was still talk about Friday's weak report on the United States jobs market. The government said that 85,000 jobs were lost in December and that the unemployment rate had not budged from 10 percent.
Following are the results of Monday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills and 10-year inflation notes:

Full text: President Obama told union leaders at a private White House meeting on Monday that he remained committed to taxing high-cost insurance policies as a way to drive down health costs. But he also signaled that he was willing to amend the proposal to "make this work for working families," a senior administration official said.
The excise tax is a major point of contention as White House and Congressional negotiators seek agreement on a final version of a sweeping bill that would extend health coverage to more than 30 million Americans. The Senate version of the bill includes such a tax on employer-sponsored health benefits; the House version does not. Union leaders deeply oppose the tax.
Mr. Obama's remarks, at an hourlong session with a dozen labor leaders in the White House Roosevelt Room, came just hours after the new president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., Richard L. Trumka, delivered a speech at the National Press Club in which he criticized the tax as a "policy that benefits elites" and warned that Democrats would pay a price at the polls if it was enacted.
Privately, Mr. Obama and the union officials used Monday's session to search for a sort of compromise, said a union leader who was briefed on the discussion. This official, who said the tone of the meeting was friendly, said it was clear that there would be some sort of excise tax in the final bill, but that the president "threw out some new concepts" in how it might be designed.
The 40 percent excise tax would apply to any cost above $8,500 for individual policies and $23,000 for family plans; the Congressional Budget Office has estimated it would generate $149 billion in tax revenues over 10 years, which would help Mr. Obama meet his goal of passing a health bill that does not add to the federal deficit.
According to one union survey, the tax would affect one in four union members. Some union officials, resigned to the likelihood that a final measure would include the tax, are pressing the White House to raise the thresholds at which it would kick in.
Until now, Mr. Obama has taken a relatively hands-off approach to the specifics of the health care bill, instead leaving them to Congress. But last week, in a meeting with House leaders, he made clear his support for the excise tax, which many economists regard as an important way to bring down health care costs. The senior administration official, who insisted on anonymity to describe a private conversation, said Mr. Obama made that point at Monday's session.
"It was a frank conversation about the excise tax," the official said, adding, "The president was very clear that he thinks this is a critical part of bringing down costs in the long term and bending the curve."
But in delving into the nitty-gritty of health care negotiations for the first time, Mr. Obama risks alienating members of the labor movement, who worked hard to elect him.
The machinists' union announced Monday that its executive council had unanimously voted to oppose any health bill that was financed by taxing the value of workers' existing health plans, and the general president of the International Association of Fire Fighters, Harold A. Schaitberger, accused Mr. Obama of abandoning his campaign promise not to tax the middle class.
"We held President Bush accountable when he made decisions that had a negative impact on our members' jobs and lives," Mr. Schaitberger, who did not attend the White House session, said in a statement. "We will do the same with President Obama."
Mr. Trumka and other union leaders said before Monday's meeting that they intended to tell Mr. Obama that the tax would be economically and politically unwise. The union officials support a tax approved by the House: a surcharge on couples earning more than $1 million a year.
Several centrist Democrats have voiced discomfort with increasing taxes on wealthier taxpayers. But Mr. Trumka showed little sympathy for their view in his National Press Club speech.
"Instead of taxing the rich, the Senate bill taxes the middle class by taxing workers' health plans -- not just union members' health care," Mr. Trumka said. "Most of the 31 million insured employees who would be hit by the excise tax are not union members."
On Capitol Hill, some House Democrats agreed. Representative Joe Courtney, Democrat of Connecticut, who has been leading opposition to the tax on high-cost health plans, said he did not see any path to imminent compromise.
"Proponents of the tax minimize the scope of its impact," Mr. Courtney said. "This is a larger issue than unions. This proposal has a much wider reach than the proponents ever acknowledge."
At a recent town-hall-style meeting in East Lyme, Conn., Mr. Courtney said, "there was not a union person in the audience," but people were fired up with concern over the issue.
Mr. Courtney said raising the thresholds would not be enough to meet his concerns. Under the Senate bill, the thresholds would rise with inflation, measured by the Consumer Price Index, plus one percentage point -- substantially less than the expected rise in health spending and insurance premiums.
Lifting thresholds "would not eliminate the flaw in the design of the tax," Mr. Courtney said. "The tax would pick up more and more health plans."

Abstract: A recent survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia indicates that forecasters expect the rate of economic growth to slow somewhat this year -- to 2.3 percent in the first quarter and 2.4 percent in the second. [...] in dollar terms, the economy is still smaller than it was at the end of 2007.

Full text: IN hindsight, it makes perfect sense that equities started to surge last March.
Stocks often move in anticipation of shifts in the economy -- they've generally rallied four to six months before recessions have ended. By the third quarter of last year, the economy was expanding again. It picked up steam toward the end of the year, validating the market's earlier optimism.
But move to the present. If the market is a predictor of economic trends, investors are now handicapping the performance of the economy and corporate profits in the spring and summer of this year. On that count, the market seems to be predicting bumps ahead.
For example, even though the Standard & Poor's 500 index of blue-chip stocks soared 62 percent from early March to mid-October, the rally has slowed. Since Oct. 15, the S.& P. 500 has risen by a more modest 4 percent.
Jeffrey N. Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL Financial in Boston, says he still expects equities to advance at the beginning of the year. But "somewhere between January and June, the rally will probably peter out," he said.
He added that "it may be the opposite of 2009, which started off falling sharply -- much like the market did in 2008 -- only to bottom out and rally for the remainder of the year." Only this time, the market may reverse course by going lower later in the year.
Why are some strategists predicting a potential pullback? For starters, the good economic news that spurred 2009's rally is expected to moderate as the year progresses.
That's not to say the economy -- or for that matter, Wall Street -- will turn outright bearish. But the bullish case is not expected to be so clear.
Consider gross domestic product. Last year, investors focused on directional change. In the second half of 2009, the economy is believed to have grown at an annual rate of roughly 3 percent, after contracting at an annual rate of more than 6 percent in the first quarter.
But the euphoria is starting to die down. A recent survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia indicates that forecasters expect the rate of economic growth to slow somewhat this year -- to 2.3 percent in the first quarter and 2.4 percent in the second.
Moreover, in dollar terms, the economy is still smaller than it was at the end of 2007.
The outlook is similar on the corporate profit front.
Last year, investors focused on forecasts that S.& P. 500 earnings would grow nearly 200 percent in the fourth quarter of 2009, versus the same period in 2008. But that stunning growth rate is expected to come down to earth in 2010.
S.& P. 500 profits are projected to rise around 38 percent for the first quarter, 23 percent for the second quarter, and 22 percent for the third, according to John Butters, director for United States earnings at Thomson Reuters.
To be sure, earnings growth above 20 percent is still well above the norm. But in dollar terms, corporate earnings are expected to be lower in the third quarter than they were in the same period in 2006.
Another concern is that some of the tail winds that propelled stocks in 2009 -- including government stimulus spending around the world -- are expected to reverse course later this year.
"The market could start to run into some of those head winds around the second quarter," said Timothy W. Hayes, chief investment strategist at Ned Davis Research in Venice, Fla.
Mr. Hayes says that if stock prices continue to climb at the start of the year, rising optimism and equity valuations may leave the market more vulnerable to bad news, like the threat of rising interest rates.
Already, long-term market interest rates have begun to climb, with the yield on 10-year Treasury notes up to 3.79 percent, from 3.20 percent at the start of December.
And central banks around the world are expected to start raising short-term rates as their economies recover and inflation fears surface.
For its part, the Federal Reserve has indicated that it expects that rates can stay low for "an extended period." Right now, the markets seem to be betting that a rate increase may occur as early as August.
But Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at the Charles Schwab brokerage firm, says, "I wouldn't be surprised if it happens a little sooner than that."
IF that's the case, many market strategists think that the market could suffer a setback. Mr. Kleintop at LPL Financial is betting that the S.& P. 500 could surge to around 1,250 early this year, which would represent a gain of about 9 percent from current levels. But he thinks that the market could give back about half those gains in a correction toward the end of the year.
Be careful what you wish for, Mr. Kleintop said. Last year, investors were praying for better-than-expected economic news. But now that a recovery may be at hand, they are beginning to fear the consequences: less fiscal stimulus from governments around the world, coupled with rising rates.

Abstract: President Evo Morales's leftist government, which has asserted greater control over some of South America's most coveted natural gas reserves, is facing a challenge as neighboring countries move to achieve energy security by cutting their dependence on Bolivian gas supplies.

Full text: President Evo Morales's leftist government, which has asserted greater control over some of South America's most coveted natural gas reserves, is facing a challenge as neighboring countries move to achieve energy security by cutting their dependence on Bolivian gas supplies.
New gas projects in Brazil and Argentina have come on line at a time when Mr. Morales is winning plaudits for a strong economy. It grew 3.7 percent last year, enabling him to consolidate control over energy resources, including natural gas, South America's second-largest such reserve after Venezuela's, and huge lithium deposits.
But even as Mr. Morales has emerged as one of the region's strongest leaders, bolstered by a landslide re-election victory in December, concern is surfacing here over Bolivia's long-term financial underpinnings as its neighbors start importing gas from distant sources like Qatar, and not so distant ones, like Trinidad and Tobago.
The reorganization of South America's energy relationships is being closely followed by countries trying to limit their reliance on energy-rich nations that are in political flux or that use their resources as a political lever, as Russia's state energy company has bullied former Soviet republics and Europe.
"The new projects in South America offer a striking example of how countries can cut their umbilical dependence on pipelines," said Carlos Alberto Lopez, an energy secretary in a previous administration here. "We are awakening to the reality that our energy nationalism is shooting us in the foot."
The new gas-import ventures in Brazil and Argentina, as well as two in Chile, once a potential market for Bolivian gas, all use ship-borne imports, in which the fuel is cooled into liquefied natural gas for transport from exporting countries and reheated on delivery. This increasingly common transport method has provided substantial competition with pipelines in some markets.
Bolivia itself once had plans to export liquefied gas by sending it first to a Chilean port, from where it would be shipped north to Mexico or the United States. But the plan caused so much outrage -- driven in part by historical tensions with Chile and by resentment of the political elite here who had championed the project -- that it was a major factor in an uprising by Bolivia's indigenous population in 2003.
Mr. Morales, 50, helped lead those protests and announced the nationalization of the energy industry after he became president in 2006. He sent soldiers to occupy gas installations, raised royalties on foreign energy companies and bolstered nationalistic institutions like the navy, which patrols rivers and lakes, and pines for sea access in this landlocked country.
While these policies intensified fears in neighboring countries over Bolivia's ability and willingness to export its gas at certain prices, they hold wide appeal among Bolivia's voters, reflected in the election victory here last month of Mr. Morales, the country's first indigenous president.
"We've been ransacked for so long," said Domitila Mora, 46, a fruit seller in El Alto, the city of slums located above the capital, La Paz. "The nationalization gave us back our dignity, and now things are better. Brother Evo Morales is taking care of our natural resources for us."
The symbolism of his energy policies permeates El Alto's bleak cityscape in the form of state advertising.
One billboard paid for by YPFB, the national energy company, extols social spending made possible by higher royalties. "There is no development without nationalization," it says, showing Mr. Morales holding a schoolgirl in his arms.
Relatively sound economic stewardship, particularly compared with Venezuela, Bolivia's top ally, makes a sudden crisis over losing gas-export markets unlikely. Bolivia's growth last year contrasted with Venezuela's 2.9 percent economic contraction, as Venezuela struggled with high inflation and a dearth of private investment.
Brazil, the region's rising power, is also not eager to see Bolivia, a major producer of cocaine and still one of South America's poorest nations, lose its hard-won economic stability.
While trying to avoid confrontation with Mr. Morales, Brazil has reassured Bolivia that it will keep importing its gas, even as Petrobras, Brazil's national energy company, has cooled to large new investments here. And private Brazilian companies like HRT have made breaking dependence on Bolivian gas a central mission.
Meanwhile, cracks are already emerging in Bolivia's energy industry as the focus of international energy companies in South America shifts decidedly to Brazil, which is developing its own new discoveries of offshore oil and gas, and away from Bolivia and Venezuela.
Prices for Bolivia's gas fell sharply in 2009, with income from gas exports declining 39 percent to $2.1 billion, according to the Bolivian Hydrocarbons Chamber, an industry group.
As foreign companies slow investments here, drilling for new fields is almost at a standstill, Bolivian energy consultants said.
YPFB, the national energy company, also faces a scandal involving a kickback scheme and the recent killing here of an energy executive who was carrying $450,000 in cash, events that Mr. Morales attributed to infiltration of the company by the Central Intelligence Agency.
But the liquefied gas projects in neighboring countries, including two in Brazil and one in Argentina, loom as a bigger challenge.
Two more liquid projects in Chile, which does not import Bolivian gas, would alter the region's energy dynamic further. Gas from those projects could also be shipped by pipeline to Argentina, a top Bolivian market.
For now, the possibility of Bolivian energy exports to Chile seems increasingly remote as Chile remains resistant to aspirations by Bolivia, reiterated here last month by Adm. Jose Luis Cabas, the commander of Bolivia's armed forces, to regain coastline from what is now Chilean territory.
"Evo's nationalization was an astute move politically in the short term," said Roger Tissot, a specialist in South American energy politics at Gas Energy, a Brazilian consulting firm, citing the increase in social spending made possible here by higher revenues. "But in the long term Bolivia is boxing itself in."
Miguel Yague, a senior energy official in Mr. Morales's government, said that Bolivia remained optimistic about maintaining exports to its neighbors and possibly establishing pipeline routes to Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay. "Looking at Brazil," he said, "it is a market of almost limitless potential."
Still, Brazil is now drawing up plans of its own to tap its newly discovered gas reserves and build its own separate liquefied natural gas terminal to possibly export the fuel during months of low demand.
And Peru, Bolivia's northwestern neighbor, is preparing to export liquefied gas, potentially shipping to markets that could have been Bolivia's.
At the same time, Bolivia is focused on smaller projects like expanding a pipeline to Argentina. Fanfare followed a recent announcement by Repsol, the Spanish energy giant, that it would increase investments in Bolivia. But skepticism persists as to whether the move was similar to those by foreign companies in Venezuela, where they seek to keep a seat at the negotiating table in a country with large energy reserves but rarely follow through on talk of large projects.
"A decade ago Bolivia was preparing to be the energy nerve center of South America," said Gonzalo Chavez, an economist at this city's Catholic University. "Now a loop of energy-security projects is going up around us."

Full text: AFTER starting with a whimper, 2009 finished with a roar, as a variety of investing approaches yielded double-digit returns in the fourth quarter.
Three of the quarter's top-performing fund managers do their work in disparate ways. One favors old-fashioned stock-picking, hunting mainly in the United States for midcapitalization stocks. Another focuses on a single region: Latin America. The third uses high-level math to invest in commodities.
Hewing to the Midcaps
Thyra Zerhusen, manager of the fund, has overseen her fund for more than a decade. During that time, its name has changed, but her approach has not.
She seeks out midcap stocks -- companies with market capitalizations from $1 billion to $12 billion -- that other investors may overlook or shun. She often invests in companies that have stumbled or were created when a division spun out of another outfit. Her fund had a total return of 11.8 percent for the quarter and 66.6 percent for the year.
Ms. Zerhusen, a native of Germany who trained to be a scientist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, the alma mater of Albert Einstein, sometimes holds investments for years. On average, she sells only a fifth of the roughly 40 stocks in her portfolio annually; that reduces trading costs and taxable gains. Her fund has an expense ratio of 1.16 percent, meaning that of every $1,000 invested, $11.60 goes to paying bills.
She favors tech stocks, if not always of the Silicon Valley style. Defining the sector broadly, she also buys industrial companies that she thinks have a technological edge. "We want companies that make their customers more efficient or productive," she said.
Consider BorgWarner, the auto parts maker. Its turbochargers bolster fuel efficiency and engine power, particularly in smaller diesels, she said. As countries and consumers seek better mileage from cars, BorgWarner is seeing increasing demand.
BorgWarner exemplifies another of her themes: it gathers a hefty share of its sales outside the United States. "About 48 percent of our holdings have 50 percent or more of their revenues coming from outside the U.S.," she said. "You hear about large-cap companies doing that, but these are midcaps. The U.S. economy is weak, but these guys are doing well in China and South America."
A South American Surge
South America -- and emerging markets generally -- sizzled in 2009. Brazil's economy, in particular, chugged along despite the slowdown in the developed world. The country's stock market advanced, too, with the benchmark Bovespa index returning more than 80 percent.
Brazil's performance gave a boost to managers like Adam J. Kutas, whose funds specialize in Latin American investing. Mr. Kutas manages , whose total return was 13.3 percent for the fourth quarter and 91.6 percent for the year.
"Latin America did so well because investors finally understood the changes that Brazil had put in place" over several years, Mr. Kutas said. Today, the country has a much-improved central bank, solid macroeconomic management and a growing consumer class, he said. And it has begun to produce companies like Petroleo Brasileiro, or Petrobras -- an oil driller that was Mr. Kutas's biggest holding at the end of September -- that are among the world leaders in their industries.
"One of the main reasons that Petrobras has grown into a $200 billion company is that it's one of the few oil companies in the world that grows its production," he said. A bonus, he added, is that "it has good corporate governance." Like Ms. Zerhusen, Mr. Kutas clings to stocks he likes. He keeps his average holding for about two years. His fund has an expense ratio of 1.07 percent.
A potential risk of any Latin America fund is hefty exposure to the tremors and quakes of commodity prices; natural-resources companies are among the region's stalwarts. In November, the energy and materials sectors accounted for about 40 percent of Mr. Kutas's fund. In contrast, energy and materials make up about 15 percent of the Standard & Poor's 500 index.
Commodities and TIPS
Commodities do not just color the investments at the fund. They, along with Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, or TIPS, are most of the portfolio. The fund, managed by Mihir P. Worah, combines commodities and TIPS to create a hedge against inflation and provide diversification beyond stocks and standard bonds.
In 2009, both commodities and TIPS performed well. With developed-world governments spending heavily to jump-start their economies, investors bid them up in expectation of eventual inflation, Mr. Worah said. But they had also lost much of their value in the panic of 2008, leaving room for rebound. "Both got to unrealistically cheap levels, so half of the outperformance was just coming back to reasonable levels," he said.
Thanks to Mr. Worah's use of mathematical modeling and derivatives, the fund belongs to the broad class of quantitative, or "quant," funds. And Mr. Worah is about as quantitative as managers come. He holds a doctorate in theoretical physics from the University of Chicago. The cancellation in the 1990s of an atom-smashing supercollider project in Texas left him without data to test his theories.
"Without data, I was just a mathematician," he said. He switched to money management, where his math ability equipped him for managing bonds.
His fund combines mathematical modeling with Pimco's bond expertise. First, using derivative contracts, he reconstructs the Dow JonesUBS Commodities Index, giving clients an investment exposure equivalent to that of buying the index's 19 commodities. Where his calculations find pricing inefficiencies, he makes small tilts against the index, substituting, say, a heating-oil derivative contract for a gasoline one.
Buying commodity derivatives requires that he put up, on the margin, only a small amount of fund's cash. He invests the rest of the money in bonds, mostly TIPS.
"Commodities protect you from a different kind inflation than TIPS do," he said. "Commodities reflect prices at the wholesale level -- things like crude oil, copper and wheat." TIPS, he noted, are indexed to the Consumer Price Index "and reflect prices of things like bread, cars and airline tickets."
If Mr. Worah makes prudent choices in his bets against the index and his selection of bonds, he can deliver additional performance, as he did in 2009. His fund has an expense ratio of 1.60 percent and had a total return of 11.8 percent for the fourth quarter and 39.8 percent for the year.

Abstract: [...] labor leaders are fuming that President Obama has endorsed a tax on high-priced, employer-sponsored health insurance policies as a way to help cover the cost of health care reform. According to a union survey, one in four members would be hit by a $23,000 threshold, but only one in 14 if the threshold were raised to $27,000.

Full text: When millions of blue-collar workers were leaning toward John McCain during the 2008 campaign, labor unions moved many of them into Barack Obama's column by repeatedly hammering one theme: Mr. McCain wanted to tax their health benefits.
But now labor leaders are fuming that President Obama has endorsed a tax on high-priced, employer-sponsored health insurance policies as a way to help cover the cost of health care reform. And as Senate and House leaders seek to negotiate a final health care bill, unions are pushing mightily to have that tax dropped from the legislation. Or at the very least, they want the price threshold raised so that the tax would affect fewer workers.
Labor leaders say the tax would hit not only wealthy executives with expensive health benefits, but also many rank-and-file union members who have often settled for lower wage increases in exchange for more generous health benefits.
The tax would affect individual insurance policies with annual premiums above $8,500 and family policies above $23,000, which by one union survey would affect one in four union members.
The House bill does not contain such an excise tax, and many House Democrats oppose adding it to the combined House-Senate legislation. But the tax is a critical revenue component in the Senate's bill. If the bill does too little to cover its costs, it might be defeated. Many economists support the tax, saying it will help hold down costs.
With labor groups warning that the tax will infuriate a key part of the Democratic base -- union members -- President Obama has agreed to meet with several top labor leaders on Monday to address their concerns and try to defuse their anger. The group includes the presidents of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., Teamsters and the steelworkers' and service employees' unions.
But whether the tax is negotiable remains unclear. Not only has Mr. Obama specifically endorsed the idea, but the White House and Senate leaders see the tax as pivotal in paying for the health care overhaul and addressing runaway health care costs.
Many Democrats and union officials fear that if both sides dig in on the issue, it could create a rift between the White House and labor -- with some union leaders hinting they might lobby aggressively against the entire health care bill if it contains such a tax.
Union leaders have repeatedly warned the White House about the strong rank-and-file dismay, which could hurt the Democrats in Congressional elections this fall, especially in battleground states like Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
Ron Gay, an AT&T repairman in Youngstown, Ohio, who spent much of the summer of 2008 urging co-workers to vote for Mr. Obama, said, "If this passes in its current form, a lot of working people are going to feel let down and betrayed by our legislators and president."
The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 19 percent of workers -- or about 30 million employees -- would be affected by the tax in 2016. Economists say most of them would be nonunion, although it is organized labor that has the lobbying clout to take a stand.
In recent days, labor's strategy has become clear. Unions are urging their members to flood their representatives with e-mail messages and phone calls in the hope that the House will stand fast and reject the tax. The A.F.L.-C.I.O., a federation of nine million union members, has declared next Wednesday "National Call-In Day" asking workers to call their lawmakers to urge them not to tax health benefits. The International Brotherhood of Teamsters is urging members to tell their representatives that "such a tax is simply a massive middle-class tax hike that this nation's working families should not be forced to endure."
Many Democrats fear that enacting the tax will hurt their re-election chances.
"This would really have a negative impact on the Democratic base," said Representative Joe Courtney, Democrat of Connecticut, who has enlisted 190 House Democrats to sign a letter opposing the tax. "As far as the message goes, it's a real toughie to defend."
While union leaders would prefer killing the tax, some say privately that they could live with it if the threshold is lifted to $27,000, say, or $30,000. They argue that many insurance policies above $23,000 are typical of the coverage in high-cost areas like New York or Boston, or policies that cover small businesses or employers with older workers.
According to a union survey, one in four members would be hit by a $23,000 threshold, but only one in 14 if the threshold were raised to $27,000.
White House officials, however, voice concern that raising the threshold that much would lose $50 billion of the $149 billion in revenue that the tax is expected to generate over 10 years.
Those officials and Senate leaders argue, moreover, that unions are wrong to fight the tax, saying that it will hold down health costs and that money employers save on health premiums will ultimately go to higher wages.
Some experts say the tax's main effect would be to deter insurers from continually raising premiums. "This is a tax on insurance companies, not on workers," said Erin Shields, an aide to Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, who is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and a chief sponsor of the excise tax.
"Health care costs are rising much faster than inflation," Ms. Shields said. "Imposing this tax will help hold down costs because it will give employers an incentive to find a plan that falls beneath the threshold and will give insurers an incentive to offer the best possible plan below the threshold."
Ms. Shields defended Mr. Obama, saying the excise tax he backs is far different from Senator McCain's proposal. Mr. McCain called for eliminating tax breaks for employer-sponsored health benefits, replaced with a tax credit to help consumers obtain health insurance, Ms. Shields said.
She added that the measure Mr. Obama supports would tax only that part of a family policy above the $23,000 threshold -- which would be taxed at a 40 percent rate.
But union officials say the tax will cause employers to push higher co-payments and deductibles onto their employees. They argue that a fairer way to generate revenue would be to embrace the House bill, which imposes an income tax surcharge on couples earning more than $1 million.
Neither the House nor the Senate would seem to have much wiggle room on the issue.
Senator Ben Nelson, Democrat of Nebraska, has said he would oppose any bill containing the House's surtax. His vote was crucial in enabling Senate Democrats to reach the 60 votes needed to pass the health bill over a potential Republican filibuster.
The House bill, meanwhile, passed by only a five-vote margin, and at least three Democrats who voted for it -- Mr. Courtney, Phil Hare of Illinois and Carol Shea-Porter of New Hampshire -- have said they would oppose a final bill if it contained an excise tax like the Senate version.
Jonathan Gruber, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist, predicted the excise tax would raise workers' wages from 2010 to 2019. "There are many academic studies showing that when health costs rise, wages fall," he said. "In the mid- and late 1990s, when we got health costs under control, wages rose nicely." But he added that other factors could have also lifted wages during that period.
Leo W. Gerard, president of the United Steelworkers, scoffed at arguments that by restraining health costs, the tax would lead to higher wages.
"The people who are promoting this tax say companies will make up for this with higher wages," Mr. Gerard said. "These people who say that have never been at the bargaining table. It doesn't work that way."
Robert Gleason, chairman of the Pennsylvania Republican Party, said Mr. Obama had made an about-face that would badly hurt the president and other Democrats. "You remember when the first President Bush said, 'Read my lips, no new taxes,' and he raised taxes and he went down to defeat," he added. "This is the same thing."
Michael P. James, a 57-year-old steelworker with the Timken Company in Canton, Ohio, campaigned for Mr. Obama and is seething about the tax.
"I don't think we should be penalized by this bill," Mr. James said. "The president would be going back on his word. If he goes ahead and passes a bill with the excise tax, I won't be able to support him again."

Turning Focus to Jobs, if Outside Events Allow It

Full text: President Obama keeps trying to turn attention to "jobs, jobs, jobs," as his chief of staff has put it. But he is finding that it can be hard to focus on any one issue when so many demand attention, often unexpectedly. And as the lackluster employment report on Friday suggested, showing concern is not the same as showing results.
The president and his party have now entered a midterm election year in which they expect to lose seats in Congress after big gains in the last two cycles. Just how many they lose will probably hinge more on pocketbook politics than on any other issue: whether voters believe the still-sluggish economy, as evidenced by the jobless rate, is reviving, and whether Mr. Obama and Congressional Democrats deserve credit or blame.
The employment situation is only the most visible of the economic policy challenges that Mr. Obama faces.
His push to overhaul financial regulation is bogged down on Capitol Hill. The housing market is still weak and his programs to help homeowners have had little impact. The Federal Reserve is under pressure from inflation hawks to begin tightening policy, while deficit hawks are demanding that government spending be restrained -- even as some economists say more stimulus is needed to avert prolonged economic sluggishness or even another recession.
But the measures by which voters are most likely to judge his success are the unemployment rate and the pace of job creation. So after an inaugural year in which Mr. Obama was absorbed in the overhaul of the health care insurance system and by a prolonged internal debate over a military buildup in Afghanistan, the White House has been trying to orchestrate a shift to showcase Mr. Obama as concerned and focused on doing everything within his power to create jobs.
But the employment report for December, which showed further job losses instead of the hoped-for gains, suggested that time might be running out for Democrats to show significant progress before voters start making up their minds -- say, by summer.
Meanwhile, the world keeps intruding as Mr. Obama tries to execute his promised pivot.
No sooner was the president home on Monday from his Hawaiian holiday break than he was closeted for days at the White House with his national security team, on responses to the foiled Christmas Day airliner attack.
With House and Senate Democrats now in the home stretch of their negotiations for a compromise on health care legislation, he will have to be more directly involved than ever before in those gritty legislative details.
Anita Dunn, until recently Mr. Obama's communications director, said that when the health care bill was completed, "that will give the administration more space to really communicate to the American people about those things that have been done and that the president continues to push forward on to make the economy work for middle-class families."
Mr. Obama, in his Friday afternoon statement on the job numbers, called them a reminder "that we have to continue to work every single day to get our economy moving again. For most Americans, and for me, that means jobs."
Mr. Obama was speaking at a White House event to call attention to his program for encouraging the creation of jobs linked to clean energy sources. He did not call for any new initiatives, though the White House has been refining a proposed package of tax incentives and other measures that Mr. Obama is likely to highlight in his State of the Union address in a few weeks.
The responses by Republicans to the jobs report on Friday reflected their belief that Mr. Obama was vulnerable to the charge that he and the Democrats are flailing.
"It's time," said Michael Steele, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, that Mr. Obama "finally do what he should have been doing over the past year -- put his full and undivided attention on fixing our economy."
At the same time, he and other Republican leaders suggest that Democrats are doing too much in the way of government intervention in the economy. Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the House Republican leader, said in a statement that "unless Washington gets out of the way" Americans will not be able to get out of "this mess."
The fact is that juggling issues is just part of being president. Unlike a candidate for the job, a president is more buffeted by events and less able to stay "on message."
The challenge for Mr. Obama, then, is to find ways to telegraph his concerns about the economy while also looking like he has done something about it.
His chief contribution -- the $787 billion stimulus package -- became law nearly a year ago; recent extensions and pending proposals building on the package will bring it to about $1 trillion in tax cuts and spending. While economists generally agree it has helped avert even greater job losses, Republicans seize on the continued high unemployment rate to argue that the plan has been a costly failure.
Many economists expect job growth to resume by February or March. The unemployment rate, however, is expected to remain as high as 10.5 percent through Election Day in November, as discouraged people who have left the job market decide to resume their search.
Assuming the economists are right, Democrats have to hope that voters focus on monthly gains in new jobs as a sign of progress. Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic pollster, said polling evidence suggested that was what many voters would do.
But David Winston, a political consultant who advises Congressional Republican leaders, said the unemployment rate was the most important indicator for voters assessing Mr. Obama's performance.
"If this number doesn't significantly improve, that's going to be a negative for him and for his party," Mr. Winston said.
And, he added, voters are liable to ask, "Why all the focus on health care when you should have been dealing with unemployment?"

Full text: Sensible Rules
To Regulate Risk

Sheila C. Bair looks to be leading the regulatory race to the top. The agency she oversees, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, recently unveiled a handful of clever ideas to contain risky bank behavior and protect the nation's deposit insurance fund. Rival watchdogs fighting for turf will find it difficult to ignore the F.D.I.C.'s latest tactics.
Generating the most buzz is a sensible plan to tie the amount that banks pay for deposit insurance to the risk in their compensation plans. Banks with plans that favor short-term gains would pay more than those that, for example, include multiyear clawbacks on bonuses. The agency will vote on the plan next week.
Of course, this comes as the Federal Reserve is also putting in place its own proposal to include executive pay in its overall assessment of bank stability. It's not clear which agency will be more stringent. But a little competition between the two wouldn't be the worst outcome after years in which banking regulators rivaled each other in their laxity.
Linking pay to insurance premiums follows a handful of other changes the F.D.I.C. is making. It recently revised the formula it uses to assess how much interest undercapitalized banks can pay to attract deposits. The net effect of the changes will be to reduce the rates banks can pay by an average of 12 basis points, the analytics firm Market Rates Insight estimates.
That is a clever way to limit moral hazard. Failing banks, more concerned with survival than profitability, often make last-ditch attempts to attract new deposits by offering ultrahigh rates on savings products wrapped by the F.D.I.C.'s insurance.
Similarly, the F.D.I.C. is pushing for a form of insurance from the buyers of failed bank assets. To mitigate some losses the fund incurs on assets in receivership, the F.D.I.C. is pushing for the buyers of the assets to make payments linked to the increase in their share prices after the announcement of a deal.
In isolation these may look to be incremental, if sensible, changes to the way the F.D.I.C. does business. But in the context of a regulatory turf battle over power and resources in Washington, it's an encouraging sign indeed.
Cuddling With Bears
The bulls and bears on the price of oil have both had their triumphs in recent history. The price of crude rose to $145.29 a barrel in July 2008 only to plummet to $33 a barrel a few months later. It swung past $82 a barrel this week because of a cold snap, and is up 18 percent since mid-December. But barring heightened tension in the Middle East, oil looks likely to slide in the short term.
Demand remains relatively subdued, in spite of the huge stimulus applied to the global economy. This is especially true in developed countries that are part of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and in the United States, the largest consumer of energy. American crude oil inventories actually rose by 1.3 million barrels last week when temperatures plummeted, according to the latest figures by the Energy Department. Elsewhere in the O.E.C.D., oil inventories have fallen slightly, according to the International Energy Agency, to nearly 60 days of demand.
Other factors could weigh on the price in the immediate future, too. A combination of easy money from the world's central banks and the weak dollar has made investing in commodities relatively attractive. But the central bankers' generosity could soon come to an end if inflation moves from a theoretical threat to a reality.
Oil bulls argue that global economic growth, in particular in China and other emerging markets, will be strong enough to sustain further gains. But the recovery remains too uncertain to call. China has just increased interest rates on its three-month bills in an effort to slow bank lending, a move that could lead to a damping of demand. That alone shaved a few cents off the oil price Thursday.
The bulls may eventually have their day. Production is falling in non-OPEC countries, even factoring in some megafields coming on stream in Russia and elsewhere. But it will not be until mid-2011 that global demand will outpace supply, according to Goldman Sachs, which predicts an average oil price of $110 for that year. It may make sense to snuggle up with the oil bears -- at least for the rest of the winter.ROLFE WINKLER and FIONA MAHARG BRAVO

Full text: The central bank of China on Thursday raised a key interest rate slightly for the first time in nearly five months, in what economists interpreted as the beginning of a broader move to tighten monetary policy and forestall inflation.
After breaking stride a year ago during the global economic slowdown, the Chinese economy resumed galloping growth over the summer. Government investments, real estate construction and consumer spending are all rising briskly as a result of a surge in lending by state-controlled banks.
Even exports have begun to recover despite continued economic weakness in the European Union and the United States, China's two biggest overseas markets.
Raising interest rates may help discourage speculative investments by Chinese companies and individuals in real estate projects and other areas of economic activity. China's difficulty is that higher rates may also prompt overseas investors seeking higher returns to redouble their efforts to push money into China, despite the country's stringent capital controls.
The People's Bank of China announced Thursday that the yield from its weekly sale of three-month central bank bills had inched up to 1.3684 percent. The yield had remained at 1.328 percent since Aug. 13.
An increase of less than 0.05 of a percentage point might sound small, but economists said it was a harbinger of more rate increases to come.
They cited expectations that consumer and producer prices would rise in the months ahead, particularly compared with low price levels a year ago, when demand temporarily slumped in China as well as the rest of the world.
"It is a turning point," said Ben Simpfendorfer, an economist in the Hong Kong offices of Royal Bank of Scotland. "There is a convergence of events that will lead to higher rates."
The increase in the interest rate turned mainland China's stock markets into Asia's worst performers Thursday. The CSI 300 index of shares on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets slumped 1.98 percent.
Air freight capacity out of mainland China and Hong Kong was almost fully booked in December, according to shippers, making it likely that China would post strong export numbers when it released a flood of monthly and annual economic data next week.
Senior corporate executives were unsure if this strength would continue this year, or whether the surge in December represented a flurry of restocking by retailers that went into the Christmas holiday season with meager inventories.
Victor Fung, the nonexecutive chairman of Li & Fung, a Hong Kong-based trading and supply chain management company that is one of the world's largest, said that overseas demand might not be strong enough to sustain the strength in China's December shipments through 2010. But his staff is somewhat more optimistic than he is, he added, as are some investment bank economists.
The slight increase in interest rates could prove even more significant if it is the start of an effort by Chinese regulators to limit bank lending. Chinese banks have lent heavily at home, and have stepped up lending in other countries as well, taking market share from Western banks hobbled by the global financial crisis.
The rate increase is not the first since the bottom of the economic downturn. After cutting interest rates by 2.4 percentage points in the last quarter of 2008, the People's Bank nudged up interest rates by 0.363 of a percent from late June to early August last year in a series of growing weekly increases.
But the central bank had stood firm ever since, watching for more evidence of the economy's health.
Central banks around the world have a history of taking small steps when they begin raising interest rates after a long period of keeping them low in response to an economic downturn. Because China does not have a well-developed bond trading market, the yields on the weekly sales of central bank bills are widely watched as a barometer of the central bank's intentions.
The central bank sells its bills mainly to banks, which pay in renminbi that the central bank then effectively takes out of circulation, slowing growth in the country's money supply.
Weekly sales of central bank bills are part of a process that economists describe as "sterilization" of China's extensive intervention in currency markets. As dollars and other foreign currencies pour into China from its trade surplus and foreign investment, the central bank prints vast sums of renminbi and issues them to buy those dollars and other currencies.
To prevent all those extra renminbi from feeding inflation, the central bank then claws back the renminbi from the market through a series of measures that include the sale of central bank bills. China also requires commercial banks to keep large reserves on deposit at the central bank, partly to keep the banks from lending too recklessly but also so that the central bank can use that money to finance further purchases of dollars and other foreign exchange.
The goal of sterilization is to keep inflation under control in China while keeping the renminbi weak. That helps make China's exports competitive overseas and preserves jobs in China, while contributing to unemployment in countries producing rival goods.
The dollars and other currencies go into China's foreign exchange reserves, which stood at $2.27 trillion at the end of September; monthly figures through the end of December are scheduled for release next week. China has the biggest foreign exchange reserves of any country, by far.
Because the central bank has essentially borrowed at home to finance that accumulation of reserves, there is considerable worry in China about losses on those reserves if the value of the dollar weakens further.
The central bank is already buying more than $300 billion a year of foreign currencies, mainly dollars, to keep the renminbi weak and preserve the competitiveness of Chinese exports in foreign markets.

Full text: Wall Street traders set aside worries about looming interest rate increases on Thursday and focused on stronger-than-expected holiday sales, helping cement modest gains for stocks.
Shares tumbled in early trading after China raised a key interest rate, creating concern that other governments might begin to tighten monetary policy and slow down lending.
Stocks fluctuated for much of the day, but by afternoon, gains in the financial and industrial sectors helped to offset losses in utilities. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 33.18 points, or 0.3 percent, to close at 10,606.86. The broader Standard & Poor 500-stock index was up 4.55 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,141.69, while the Nasdaq slipped 1.04 points to 2,300.05.
Many investors expect 2010 to be a year of steady growth for equity markets and the broader economy, bolstered by increases in consumer spending. But traders are still hesitant about several sectors, particularly the housing and labor markets, and they are waiting to see how soon governments will raise interest rates to thwart inflation.
Oil fell from a 15-month high on Thursday after 10 days of gains, slipping 52 cents to $82.66 a barrel, after the Energy Information Administration said crude oil supplies rose last week. Natural gas supplies declined, in line with expectations.
The dollar strengthened against most world currencies, including the Japanese yen and the Swedish krona. Since March, the dollar has generally weakened as stocks have risen, but that relationship has shown signs of softening in recent weeks.
Frank M. Pavilonis, senior markets strategist for Lind-Waldock, attributed the shift to concerns about sovereign debt, especially in places like Greece and Poland. "That's a big, horrible situation right there, and it's making the United States look attractive by comparison," Mr. Pavilonis said.
Equity investors were encouraged by news that retailers reported modest gains during the 2009 holiday season. Sales increased 2.9 percent in December compared with the previous year, which was one of the worst in decades.
In Asia, shares fell after China's central bank raised a key interest rate slightly for the first time in nearly five months. The move was seen as a harbinger of tighter monetary policy as governments seek to stave off inflation.
Policy makers must balance low interest rates, meant to spur lending, against the fear of rising prices, which could hurt spending by businesses and consumers.
"We're not seeing a market that's absolutely falling to pieces," said Marc Harris, co-head of global research for RBC Capital Markets. "We've been living in a bit of a magical thinking world where money is free and seemingly available everywhere, but now we're seeing that free money and excessive stimulus is not going to be the environment we live in forever."
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng fell 0.7 percent, while in Japan, the Nikkei index fell 0.5 percent. European markets were mixed, with the FTSE in Britain down 0.1 percent, the DAX in Germany falling 0.3 percent, and the CAC 40 in France rising 0.2 percent.
In the bond market, the Treasury's 10-year note was unchanged at 96 11/32. The yield was also unchanged from Wednesday, remaining at 3.82 percent.
In the United States, stocks were helped by several analyst upgrades. J.P. Morgan said General Electric was among its top choices for electrical stocks, helping send shares of the company up 5 percent. An encouraging outlook from Credit Suisse helped drive shares of Bank of America up 3 percent.
The government reported Thursday that weekly unemployment claims rose to 434,000 -- a small increase of 1,000 over the previous week, beating expectations. Total unemployment claims remained at record levels, reaching 10.4 million this month.
Even as the pace of layoffs slows, economists fear that high levels of unemployment could hurt the recovery as consumers cut back on spending.
On Friday, when the government releases its monthly employment report for December, economists expect the jobless rate to remain at 10 percent, according to a survey by Bloomberg News. Before last fall, the United States had not had double-digit employment since 1982.
At the same time, some economists predicted that the report would show an actual increase in jobs in December, which would be the first month of net gains since the recession began in late 2007.

Full text: If only we'd had more power, we could have kept the financial crisis from getting so bad.
That has been the position of Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, and other regulators. It explains why Mr. Bernanke and the Obama administration are pushing Congress to give the Fed more authority over financial firms.
So let's consider what an empowered Fed might have done during the housing bubble, based on the words of the people who were running it.
In 2004, Alan Greenspan, then the chairman, said the rise in home values was "not enough in our judgment to raise major concerns." In 2005, Mr. Bernanke -- then a Bush administration official -- said a housing bubble was "a pretty unlikely possibility." As late as May 2007, he said that Fed officials "do not expect significant spillovers from the subprime market to the rest of the economy."
The fact that Mr. Bernanke and other regulators still have not explained why they failed to recognize the last bubble is the weakest link in the Fed's push for more power. It raises the question: Why should Congress, or anyone else, have faith that future Fed officials will recognize the next bubble?
Just this week, Mr. Bernanke went to the annual meeting of academic economists in Atlanta to offer his own history of Fed policy during the bubble. Most of his speech, though, was a spirited defense of the Fed's interest rate policy, complete with slides and formulas, like (pt - pt*) > 0. Only in the last few minutes did he discuss lax regulation. The solution, he said, was "better and smarter" regulation. He never acknowledged that the Fed simply missed the bubble.
This lack of self-criticism is feeding Congressional hostility toward the Fed. Mr. Bernanke is still likely to win confirmation for a second term, based on his aggressive and creative policies once the crisis began. But Congress hasn't decided whether to expand his regulatory authority and is considering reining in the Fed's other main mission -- setting interest rates.
A once-marginal proposal -- from Representative Ron Paul, the Texas Republican -- that would give Congress the power to review interest rate decisions recently passed the House and will soon be considered by the Senate.
Economists are generally horrified by this idea. If Congress could force Fed officials to answer questions about every interest rate move, the process could easily become politicized. A politicized central bank is a first step toward runaway inflation.
But politicizing monetary policy isn't the only mistake Congress could make. It also could end up going in the other direction and handing Fed officials more power without asking them to grapple with their failures.
When Mr. Bernanke is challenged about the Fed's performance, he often points out that recognizing a bubble is hard. "It is extraordinarily difficult," he said during his Senate confirmation hearing last month, "to know in real time if an asset price is appropriate or not."
Most of the time, that's true. Do you know if stocks will keep going up? Is gold now in the midst of a bubble? What will happen to your house's value? Questions like these are usually an invitation to hubris.
But the recent housing bubble was an exception. By any serious measure, houses in much of this country had become overvalued. From the late 1960s to 2000, the ratio of the median national house price to median income hovered from 2.9 to 3.2. By 2005, it had shot up to 4.5. In some places, buyers were spending twice as much on their monthly mortgage payment as they would have spent renting a similar house, without even considering the down payment.
More than a few people -- economists, journalists, even some Fed officials -- noticed this phenomenon. It wasn't that hard, if you were willing to look at economic fundamentals. You couldn't know exactly when or how far prices would fall, but it seemed clear they were out of control. Indeed, making that call was similar to what the Fed does when it sets interest rates: using concrete data to decide whether some part of the economy is too hot (or too cold).
And Fed officials could have had a real impact if they had decided to attack the bubble. Imagine if Mr. Greenspan, then considered an oracle, announced he was cracking down on wishful-thinking mortgages, as he had the authority to do.
So why did Mr. Greenspan and Mr. Bernanke get it wrong?
The answer seems to be more psychological than economic. They got trapped in an echo chamber of conventional wisdom. Real estate agents, home builders, Wall Street executives, many economists and millions of homeowners were all saying that home prices would not drop, and the typically sober-minded officials at the Fed persuaded themselves that it was true. "We've never had a decline in house prices on a nationwide basis," Mr. Bernanke said on CNBC in 2005.
He and his colleagues fell victim to the same weakness that bedeviled the engineers of the Challenger space shuttle, the planners of the Vietnam and Iraq Wars, and the airline pilots who have made tragic cockpit errors. They didn't adequately question their own assumptions. It's an entirely human mistake.
Which is why it is likely to happen again.
What's missing from the debate over financial re-regulation is a serious discussion of how to reduce the odds that the Fed -- however much authority it has -- will listen to the echo chamber when the next bubble comes along. A simple first step would be for Mr. Bernanke to discuss the Fed's recent failures, in detail. If he doesn't volunteer such an accounting, Congress could request one.
In the future, a review process like this could become a standard response to a financial crisis. Andrew Lo, an M.I.T. economist, has proposed a financial version of the National Transportation Safety Board -- an independent body to issue a fact-finding report after a crash or a bust. If such a board had existed after the savings and loan crisis, notes Paul Romer, the Stanford economist and expert on economic growth, it might have done some good.
Whether we like it or not, the Fed really does seem to be the best agency to regulate financial firms. (It now has authority over only some firms.) As the lender of last resort, it already has a vested interest in the health of those firms. The Fed's prestige also tends to give it its pick of people who want to work on economic policy.
"The Federal Reserve has unparalleled expertise," Mr. Bernanke told Congress last month. "We have a great group of economists, financial market experts and others who are unique in Washington in their ability to address these issues."
Fair enough. At some point, though, it sure would be nice to hear those experts explain how they missed the biggest bubble of our time.

Full text: It is one of the bleakest new years that states have seen in over a decade.
On Wednesday, governors in California, Kentucky and New York kick off the season of addresses to state lawmakers as at least 36 states struggle to close budget shortfalls and also begin confronting the next fiscal year's woes.
For many of the states, the new year spells the end to accounting maneuvers, one-off solutions, tax increases and service cuts that were as deep as lawmakers thought they could bear. And governors confront this situation in an election year in which dozens of their jobs are in play, and as many state legislators face their own election challenges.
"A budget gap of 5 percent or 10 percent in any given year is a tough problem," said Corina Eckl, fiscal director at the National Conference of State Legislatures. "But we're talking about gaps in excess of 20 percent over multiple years. The size of these gaps is staggering."
California's problems, including a projected budget deficit of $20 billion, are as outsized as the state itself.
In his state-of-the-state message here, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, will proclaim California close to incapable of paying for social services in the next fiscal year, which begins in July, unless the Obama administration greatly increases aid to the state. That will be just one of many bleak assessments -- and far-from-slam-dunk prescriptions -- that Mr. Schwarzenegger will proffer as he and nearly every other governor face another year of extraordinary fiscal distress.
High unemployment, continued reverberations from the foreclosure crisis and a severe drop in all forms of taxes have combined to leave states -- which historically have lagged behind the private sector in recession recoveries by about two years -- reeling.
State tax collections for the third quarter of 2009 showed a drop of 10.7 percent, the third consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue decline, according to the Rockefeller Institute, though the dip was smaller than the preceding two quarters.
While some states are showing modest improvement, others continue to set record lows. Revenues for Michigan, one of the nation's most fiscally challenged states, are at a 45-year low, when adjusted for inflation. Many of the states that increased spending generally during the rosier years of the last decade are paying for it now.
Oklahoma's projected budget gap of $1.3 billion for the next fiscal year is the largest since the Depression, said Scott Meacham, the state treasurer.
"Government is subject to a bit of mission creep over time," Mr. Meacham said. "We do things that are great to do but not maybe the core mission of government. We need to look at some more fundamental shifts."
Further, the federal stimulus dollars that helped keep many local governments afloat last year will begin to evaporate. Debt service -- a Peter-Paul system for many states last year -- has also grown. The cost of keeping citizens in government programs, like Medicaid, has also risen, as unemployment funds have teetered toward insolvency over the last 18 months.
Cost savings so far have included cuts to specific programs; Michigan and California both stopped offering dental services to some Medicaid recipients last year. But there have also been layoffs -- Kentucky's state work force has shrunk by 1,600 over the last two years -- and symbolic moves, like Delaware's decision last year to turn state-office thermostats down in the winter and up in the summer.
In many ways, states averted deeper cuts than anticipated last year because of the federal stimulus package. But those dollars will shrink over the next fiscal year, and unless jobs return and tax revenues rise, or Congress sends them more aid, states will most likely continue to be overextended.
"We are still cash positive," said Ann Visalli, the director of Office of Management and Budget for Delaware, where two auto plants and a major oil refinery closed this year. "However, because of the drop-off in federal stimulus and state revenues not materializing, we do have to continue with budget cuts."
Some governors will almost certainly be looking to the federal government for help. While proclaiming that the state is not seeking a bailout, according to a draft part of his speech on Wednesday, Mr. Schwarzenegger will say, "We need to work with the feds so that we can fix the flawed formula that demands that states spend money they do not have."
Some states will most likely continue with across-the-board cuts, accounting moves like moving last payroll dates into the next fiscal year, as California has done in the past, and furloughs. But more states are expected to face an equally unpopular choice between eliminating services or raising taxes.
Last year nine states raised income taxes, and 15 states and the District of Columbia raised taxes on cigarettes.
"There is pressure for more tax increases in more states," said Joseph Henchman, the director of state projects for the Tax Foundation, a research group. "It will be a hard sell in states where people think spending hasn't been cut enough."
One test of voter tolerance for new taxes will come next month in Oregon, where voters will be asked to consider two measures that would increase taxes on corporations and wealthy taxpayers to help balance the state's budget, specifically for education, health care and public safety.
"This will be an indication on whether or not people are willing to invest in core areas of government right now," said Jim Ross, a political consultant who has run Democratic campaigns in Oregon. "It is true in Oregon and most other places in the country."
There are some signs of sunshine, and opportunity, in the budget problems. Over the past three months, coincident indexes -- measures of current economic conditions in a state boiled down to a single statistic -- have increased in 20 states, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, even as they decreased in 25 and remained unchanged in five. Unemployment has slowed in many states as well.
Further, states have had no trouble tapping the bond market; 2010 is expected to be a record year for municipal bonds, $450 billion compared with $409 billion in 2009. That is an indication that there remains investor interest and a willingness among state leaders to continue to invest in infrastructure, which can preserve or even create jobs.
States have also been forced to rethink how they do business, with examples like energy savings, new approaches to the management of prisons or the ways they manage gambling. Kentucky, for instance, wants video lottery terminals at race tracks.
"The good news is that there's a target-rich environment for any states interested in new ideas," said Robert B. Ward, the director of Fiscal Studies at the Rockefeller Institute, which is based in Albany.

Abstract: Staggering numbers of Americans are still unemployed and nearly a quarter of all homeowners owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth. The real story right now is the entrenched suffering (with no end in sight) that has been inflicted on scores of millions of working Americans by the Great Recession and the misguided economic policies that preceded it.

Full text: I'm starting the new year with the sinking feeling that important opportunities are slipping from the nation's grasp. Our collective consciousness tends to obsess indiscriminately over one or two issues -- the would-be bomber on the flight into Detroit, the Tiger Woods saga -- while enormous problems that should be engaged get short shrift.
Staggering numbers of Americans are still unemployed and nearly a quarter of all homeowners owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth. Forget the false hope of modestly improving monthly job numbers. The real story right now is the entrenched suffering (with no end in sight) that has been inflicted on scores of millions of working Americans by the Great Recession and the misguided economic policies that preceded it.
As The Washington Post reported over the weekend, the entire past decade "was the worst for the U.S. economy in modern times." There was no net job creation -- none -- between December 1999 and now. None!
The Post article read like a lament, a longing for the U.S. as we'd once known it: "No previous decade going back to the 1940s had job growth of less than 20 percent."
Middle-class families in 2008 actually earned less, adjusted for inflation, than they did in 1999. The data for 2009 are not yet in, but you can just imagine what happened to those families in that nightmarish downturn. Small children over the holidays were asking Santa Claus to bring mommy or daddy a job.
One in eight Americans, and one in four children, are on food stamps. Some six million Americans, according to an article in The Times on Sunday, have said that food stamps were their only income.
This is a society in deep, deep trouble and the fixes currently in the works are in no way adequate to the enormous challenges we're facing. For example, an end to the mantra of monthly job losses would undoubtedly be welcomed. But even if the economy manages to create a few hundred thousand new jobs a month, it would do little to haul us from the unemployment pit dug for us by the Great Recession. We need to create more than 10 million new jobs just to get us back to where we were when the recession began in December 2007.
What's needed are big new innovative efforts to fashion an economy that creates jobs for all who want and need to work. Just getting us back in fits and starts over the next few years to where we were when the recession began should not be acceptable to anyone. We should be moving now to invest aggressively in a new, greener economy, leading the world in the development of alternative fuels, advanced transportation networks and the effort to restrain the poisoning of the planet. We should be developing an industrial policy that emphasizes the need for America to regain its manufacturing mojo, as tough as that might seem, and we need to rebuild our infrastructure.
We're not smart as a nation. We don't learn from the past, and we don't plan for the future. We've spent a year turning ourselves inside out with arguments of every sort over health care reform only to come up with a bloated, Rube Goldberg legislative mess that protects the insurance and drug industries and does not rein in runaway health care costs.
The politicians will be back soon, trust me, screaming about the need to rein in health costs.
We keep talking about how essential it is to radically improve public education while, at the same time, we're closing libraries and firing teachers by the tens of thousands for economic reasons.
The fault lies everywhere. The president, the Congress, the news media and the public are all to blame. Shared sacrifice is not part of anyone's program. Politicians can't seem to tell the difference between wasteful spending and investments in a more sustainable future. Any talk of raising taxes is considered blasphemous, but there is a constant din of empty yapping about controlling budget deficits.
Oh, yes, and we're fighting two wars.
If America can't change, then the current state of decline is bound to continue. You can't have a healthy economy with so many millions of people out of work, and there is no plan now that would result in the creation of millions of new jobs any time soon.
Voters were primed at the beginning of the Obama administration for fundamental changes that would have altered the trajectory of American life for the better. Politicians of all stripes, many of them catering to the nation's moneyed interests, fouled that up to a fare-thee-well.
Now we're escalating in Afghanistan, falling back into panic mode over an attempted act of terror and squandering a golden opportunity to build a better society.

Abstract: A combination of frigid weather, expectations of an improving economy and new tensions between Russia and Belarus catapulted crude oil prices above $81 a barrel on Monday to the highest close in nearly 15 months. Expectations among experts on oil prices for the coming year range widely, in part because no one can be sure how strong the economic recovery will be or what impact a potential crisis like an Israeli bombing of Iranian nuclear facilities would have on oil markets.

Full text: A combination of frigid weather, expectations of an improving economy and new tensions between Russia and Belarus catapulted crude oil prices above $81 a barrel on Monday to the highest close in nearly 15 months.
Energy markets are beginning the year with a number of economic signs that could help push prices higher still. Traders viewed reports of increased manufacturing activity and passenger car sales in December as indications that the economy was on the mend. Meanwhile, India reported a substantial increase in oil imports.
The eighth consecutive trading session of rising prices was also attributed to nervousness over reports that Russia might charge higher prices and raise export taxes on oil sent to Belarus for refining for European markets. And heating oil futures rose to the highest level in more than a year as cold weather was reported across much of Europe, China and the United States.
Gasoline prices, which had been falling until recently, have reversed course to jump 6 cents in the last week. And with American stockpiles of crude oil sliding by 19.5 million barrels in the last month, higher prices at the pump could be coming in the weeks ahead.
Still, most energy analysts said it was too soon to predict that crude and gasoline prices would go substantially higher. They pointed out that oil prices had been see-sawing within a relatively narrow range from $70 to just above $80 a barrel since the end of July. Oil prices closed above $81 on Nov. 4, before dropping again to as low as $70 a month ago.
On Monday, oil for February delivery climbed about 3 percent to $81.51 a barrel, the highest settlement price since Oct. 9, 2008.
Oil prices have gradually revived since mid-December, followed by gasoline prices in recent days. The national average for a gallon of regular gasoline was $2.66 on Monday, a dollar above the price at the beginning of 2009, when the economy appeared to be in a tailspin.
The jittery price of oil reflects conflicting trends. Economic performance is still weak and supplies are plentiful on the world market, with manufacturing activity and driving still at relatively low levels in many industrialized countries.
"We've tried now three times to hold above $80 since October, and we have failed each time, largely because supplies remain so strong and demand remains fairly weak," said Addison A. Armstrong, senior director of market research at Tradition Energy, an energy broker in Stamford, Conn.
But at the same time, expectations of a stronger economy have encouraged investors to pour money into commodities, in anticipation of higher demand and as a hedge against inflation.
"It's a little bit of a sugar rush from all the money that comes into commodities at the beginning of every year," said Tom Kloza, chief oil analyst at the Oil Price Information Service. "By next week we'll know whether this is another typical false start, or whether it's relevant and related to supply and demand."
Mr. Kloza predicted that the average price for regular gasoline would rise above $2.70 in coming days, higher than at any time in 2009. But he said that after peaking around $2.75, prices would drift lower as driving declined in the dead of winter. He said he expected a spring rally to $3 a gallon or higher. "The question I have is, will those prices stick around for awhile?"
Some experts say a rising gasoline price could slow the economic recovery. As gasoline prices move toward $3 a gallon, Mr. Armstrong said, "consumers don't take that extra trip shopping or to a restaurant, and the U.S. consumer is still responsible for two-thirds of the economy in this country."
Expectations among experts on oil prices for the coming year range widely, in part because no one can be sure how strong the economic recovery will be or what impact a potential crisis like an Israeli bombing of Iranian nuclear facilities would have on oil markets.
In October, many energy experts predicted that the move to $80 would continue and that oil would break $100 by early 2010. Then when the price fell to $70 a month or so ago, few experts predicted the quick rebound that ensued.
Many now say the best bet is for continued volatility.
Adam E. Sieminski, chief energy economist for Deutsche Bank, said he expected an average price of $65 in 2010, although he would not discount the possibility of a "big spike in the event of a big geopolitical event."
"By the middle of the year we need the delivery of good news and not merely the expectation of good news about the economy" to support prices, he said. "It's going to take a year or more before you change things enough to actually reduce the overhang of inventories and OPEC spare capacity."

Abstract: According to the Pew Center on the States, state spending from general funds on corrections increased from $10.6 billion in 1987 to more than $44 billion in 2007, a 127 percent increase in inflation-adjusted dollars.

Full text: The United States, which has less than 5 percent of the world's population, has about one-quarter of its prisoners. But the relentless rise in the nation's prison population has suddenly slowed as many states discover that it is simply too expensive to overincarcerate.
Between 1987 and 2007 the prison population nearly tripled, from 585,000 to almost 1.6 million. Much of that increase occurred in states -- many with falling crime rates -- that had adopted overly harsh punishment policies, such as the "three strikes and you're out" rule and drug laws requiring that nonviolent drug offenders be locked away.
These policies have been hugely costly. According to the Pew Center on the States, state spending from general funds on corrections increased from $10.6 billion in 1987 to more than $44 billion in 2007, a 127 percent increase in inflation-adjusted dollars. In the same period, adjusted spending on higher education increased only 21 percent.
In 2008, the explosion of the prison population ground to a near halt, according to data released last month by the Bureau of Justice Statistics. About 739,000 inmates were admitted to federal and state facilities, only about 3,500 more than were released.
One factor seems to be tight budgets as states decide to release nonviolent offenders early. This can not only save money. If done correctly, it can also be very sound social policy. Many nonviolent offenders can be dealt with more effectively and more cheaply through treatment and jobs programs.
Michigan, which has been hard hit by the recession, has done a particularly good job of releasing people who do not need to be in prison. As the American Civil Liberties Union's National Prison Project details in a new report, Michigan reduced its prison population by about 8 percent between March 2007 and November 2009 by taking smart steps, notably doing more to get nonviolent drug offenders out, while helping in their transition to a productive, and crime-free, life.
Not every state has gotten the message. Florida, for example, has a state law mandating that all prisoners serve a high percentage of their sentence, which is both dubious corrections policy and terrible fiscal policy.
For many years, driving up prison populations has been an easy thing for elected officials to do, popular with voters and powerful corrections officer unions. The new incarceration figures suggest, however, that in the current hard economic times, strapped states are beginning to realize that they do not have the money to keep people in prison who do not need to be there.

Abstract: Reaching back into the nation's history books, some lawmakers are suggesting a war bond program similar to those used during the Civil War and both World Wars. Senator Ben Nelson, the Democrat from Nebraska who last month introduced war bond legislation, said in a statement that he hoped to "tap into the same spirit of patriotism and create a sense of participation in the war effort akin to that shown by the greatest generation."

Full text: How do you pay for a war? The question re-emerged in Congress last month afterPresident Obama announced he would send 30,000 more troops to Afghanistan, and it is likely to be a major issue as lawmakers return to work in January.
Reaching back into the nation's history books, some lawmakers are suggesting a war bond program similar to those used during the Civil War and both World Wars. Such a program might reduce the country's reliance on foreign borrowing and avoid a tax increase.
The World War II bonds in particular have a certain popular appeal. They were promoted by movie stars likeBette Davis andRita Hayworth, who toured the country to rally support.Norman Rockwell drew up some of the government's advertisements, with slogans like: "Ours ... to fight for. Freedom from fear." And the Treasury Department organized a door-to-door drive. About $185 billion in bonds were sold.
Senator Ben Nelson, the Democrat from Nebraska who last month introduced war bond legislation, said in a statement that he hoped to "tap into the same spirit of patriotism and create a sense of participation in the war effort akin to that shown by the greatest generation."
Can you see it?Britney Spears andOprah touring Midwestern towns to rally support for the war? It sounds farfetched today, and not just because the public is more skeptical.
Economists and others who have studied the war bonds programs say America's economy has matured in ways that would make such an effort possibly harmful to today's economy. For decades, Americans have been urged to consume. Encouraging people to set aside money for the war could slow the economic recovery.
"With war bonds, we would be effectively saving this money and taking it out of circulation," said James J. Kimble, a professor at Seton Hall University and author of "Mobilizing the Home Front: War Bonds and Domestic Propaganda." "War bonds in effect limit our spending. It could be that that ends up shooting our economy in the foot because our economy was more built on spending today."
Consider the economic logic behind war bonds. In World War II, the secretary of the Treasury, Henry Morgenthau Jr., weighed three options for financing the war: printing money, raising taxes or issuing war bonds. But printing money can cause inflation, and imposing taxes would not offer Americans the opportunity to give to the war effort. (In the end, the government ended up printing money and raising taxes, but the bonds limited the extent of those actions.)
War bonds in 1941 translated into sacrifice. Indeed, in 1942, Mr. Morgenthau initiated the door- to-door drives to encourage Americans to buy the bonds. "I am not thinking of a token contribution," he said.
But can Americans make a real investment in war bonds today without hurting the economy? Mr. Nelson suggested the bonds as an alternative to a war tax, which he said would be more damaging to the economy. Taxes and war bonds would both take money out of the system that might otherwise be spent at the shopping mall.
But today, the economic recovery looms as a greater concern to many people than war costs. Spending on Iraq and Afghanistan is significantly less, proportionately, than spending on World War II. That war accounted for about a third of the nation's economic output; the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan add up to just over 5 percent of gross domestic product today, according to Hugh Rockoff, an economics professor at Rutgers University who has studied war bonds programs.
Another difference, economists point out, is that World War II was a boon to the economy, creating jobs, mainly in manufacturing. The war against terrorism has not provided similar benefits for the American economy.
"Back then you had all these people who suddenly had a lot of extra cash because they were working two shifts for the war," said Mr. Kimble. "This war is not contributing in the same way. This war is an outflow, if you will. Some people have described this as more of a spectator's war. We just get to watch."
Of course, the United States today has a fourth option to pay for the war that Mr. Morgenthau lacked in the 1940s: borrowing from other countries. During World War II, America was a creditor nation, lending out money to others. Today, the United States is a debtor nation -- a point Senator Nelson has seized on in pushing his idea. "War bonds allow us to borrow from ourselves, rather than other countries," he said.
But Professor Rokoff is doubtful that war bonds are the answer. (A program by the Treasury Department to sell Patriot Bonds, begun after 9/11 to contribute to the government's "overall effort to fight the war on global terrorism," has raised only $10.9 billion in eight years.)
"We are financing all of these deficits with debt," Mr. Rokoff said. "A bond campaign might be a morale booster. But it's a different world now. I could see people protesting outside of the bond rallies. In the long run, they're going to have to raise taxes."

Full text: It was the age of zeroes, the epoch of naughts, an era when we started with something and added just about nothing.
At least that's what stock market commentators have been gravely telling us for at least a year. The 2000s, they argue, was a lost decade. And at first glance, they appear to have gotten it exactly right.
If you invested $100,000 on Jan. 1, 2000, in the Vanguard index fund that tracks the Standard & Poor's 500, you would have ended up with $89,072 by mid-December of 2009. Adjust that for inflation by putting it in January 2000 dollars and you're left with $69,114.
But that is not how most real people invest. They don't pour everything they have into just one type of asset and then add nothing to it for 10 years. Instead, they buy stocks of all sorts, and bonds and perhaps other things, too. And many millions of them dutifully add more money regularly, usually into a retirement account that they won't touch for longer than a decade.
For those people, it was not a lost decade at all. Even those who started with a low six-figure balance could have doubled their total savings in the last 10 years.
How? Consider a few decade-long scenarios that I asked Vanguard to run using its low-cost index mutual funds. In each, we assumed that the money was in a tax-deferred account and that the account owner reinvested any dividends.
First of all, even people who put all of their money in stocks rarely invest only in the big American names that make up the S.& P. 500.
So say you put $50,000 in the much broader Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund at the beginning of the decade. Then, for exposure to equities outside the United States, you put another $50,000 into Vanguard's Total International Stock Index Fund.
As of mid-December, your $100,000 would have grown to $109,334, though that is just $84,921 when you take inflation into account. Still pretty dismal, though it shows the importance of diversification even within a broad category like stocks.
Now, consider a much more realistic scenario, with 50 percent of the money in bonds. If the decade begins with $25,000 in each of the domestic and international stock funds and $50,000 in Vanguard's Total Bond Market Index Fund, you end it with $145,619, or $112,971 in 2000 dollars.
That's how retirees, with a fairly aggressive 50 percent chunk of the portfolio in stocks, might have fared if they had been hoarding some investments while living mostly off Social Security and a pension or annuity. (For those who were spending down a portfolio with this aggressive allocation, there is no salve except the hope that what they have left will continue to bounce back.)
But if you're not yet retired, you were probably adding money to your portfolio throughout the decade. Let's say you started with the same $100,000 and the identical 25/25/50 asset allocation from the previous scenario. Now, imagine that you added $1,000 a month and then rebalanced your account annually so that you began each new year with that original allocation.
The result? You ended up with $313,747, or $260,102 in January 2000 dollars. Hardly a lost decade at all.
Your own balance may be much different from this. But if you're moderately affluent, reasonably diligent and began the decade in your 30s or 40s (or were a bit older and got a late start in getting serious about retirement savings), this scenario won't be that far off.
It's easier to hit that $1,000 monthly saving if you have an employer matching some of your contributions. And consistent saving depends in large part on avoiding unemployment, which hasn't been easy.
Even if your income continues uninterrupted, you can't lose your nerve either. Plenty of people take their money out of stocks and put it into cash when the stock market falls. Then, they don't put it back in until long after the recovery begins.
This can cost you whole percentage points in annual returns, which add up to hundreds of thousands of dollars over a lifetime. Indeed, investors in the hot fund of the moment will often earn returns way lower than the fund's ads proclaim, though Vanguard index fund investors tend to be more of the slow and steady type.
And it's that lifetime that's important. The recent focus on the past decade's performance is misguided for all sorts of reasons.
First of all, 10 years is not a particularly long time horizon. Retirement investors may begin saving at 22 and have money in stocks at 82. People who open 529 college savings accounts upon the birth of a child will keep them open for at least two decades and possibly longer.
A decade is a particularly short period of time for anyone who will need the money at the end of it. If that's the case, the majority of it probably shouldn't be in stocks in the first place, which would make the 10-year S.& P. 500 return less relevant.
Finally, this particular decade happened to start at an enormously overvalued moment. According to data from the Yale economist Robert J. Shiller, as of January 2000, the 10-year S.& P. 500 price-earnings ratio stood at 43.77, a month removed from its record high.
As a result, a lot of the lost decade hand-wringing is merely a result of this coincidence of the calendar. The 10-year performance figures may not look like such a lost decade a year or two from now, when the tally begins in 2001 or 2002 and the S.& P. 500 was at much lower levels.
The real danger in the lost-decade rhetoric is that it could scare people away from stocks permanently. Again, the long term is what matters to most stock investors. And according to Vanguard, the S.& P. 500's worst 45-year run, for the period ending in September 1974, produced an average annual return of 6.53 percent.
Many of us could live with that, but stocks may not do even that well for the next 45 years. Near the stock market's nadir in 2009, Robert D. Arnott of Research Affiliates scared a number of readers half to death by noting in an article in The Journal of Indexes that from February 1969 to February 2009, investors in 20-year Treasury bonds outperformed the S.& P. 500.
Stocks have since pulled ahead again, but Mr. Arnott's larger point still stands -- that the reward you're supposed to get for the added risk of investing in stocks can seem awfully elusive in some contexts.
No one knows which asset class will outperform the others over the next 10 (or 45) years. That's why it's important to invest in more than just stocks, and why a bad stretch for certain stocks may not matter as much as it first appears.
Few of us have the long-term investing prowess to pick the right moment for the right stocks. But persistence has its own rewards. Savers are never losers, even if some stocks have let us all down in the short term.

Abstract: According to the MSCI indexes, which measure virtually all stock markets using consistent criteria, an investor in the American market who reinvested all dividends -- and who somehow avoided all taxes and transaction costs for the decade -- would have ended 2009 with 12 percent fewer dollars than when the decade began. Even that calculation understates the sad news for stock investors. Because of inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, a 2009 dollar is worth about 78 cents in 1999 dollars.

Full text: It was a decade that began with such promise. Stock markets in Europe and America ended the 1990s at record levels, and even bedraggled Japan was at a two-year high. "Dow 36,000" was on some best-seller lists.
Instead, it became a decade that richly earned the name "the zeros." For the entire developed world, that was just about the decade's total return.
The United States stock market lagged even that modest return. According to the MSCI indexes, which measure virtually all stock markets using consistent criteria, an investor in the American market who reinvested all dividends -- and who somehow avoided all taxes and transaction costs for the decade -- would have ended 2009 with 12 percent fewer dollars than when the decade began. That is an annual return of negative 1.3 percent.
Even that calculation understates the sad news for stock investors. Because of inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, a 2009 dollar is worth about 78 cents in 1999 dollars.
Over all, the developed world did manage to rise a puny 2.3 percent, or an annual rate of 0.2 percent, not enough to offset the transaction costs any investor would have faced, and far below inflation.
Those figures are measured in dollars to assure international comparability. The dollar also weakened over the period, meaning that the apparent returns were even worse when measured in other currencies.
Of course, things looked much worse a year ago.
In 2009, stock markets around the world recovered strongly after hitting bottom in late winter. For the year, the American index was up about 27 percent and the developed world rose about 31 percent.
But it was a different story for emerging markets, which actually did emerge. When the decade began, China had the 43rd-largest stock market in the world, trailing such countries as the Philippines, Peru and Poland. At the end of the decade, its market capitalization ranked ninth in the world, having passed countries like Brazil, Spain and Italy.
Much of that growth was the result of new issues, as China partly privatized many government-owned enterprises. But an investor in Chinese stocks over the decade would have earned more than 150 percent, or a compounded 9.7 percent.
Among emerging markets, that return was actually a little below average. As a group, emerging markets gained about 160 percent, or 10.1 percent a year. Brazil's market grew more than 500 percent, or 20 percent a year. India climbed at an annual rate of 14.1 percent, for a total gain of more than 270 percent.
Among the developed countries, the best performers for the decade were those that were most dependent on natural resources, whose prices generally rose, in part because of additional demand from expanding economies in emerging markets. Canada's stock market more than doubled, providing an annual return of 9.2 percent, while Australia's tripled, giving investors an annual return of 12.7 percent.
Just as few forecasters predicted the sad performance of most developed countries, so, too, did few foresee the gains for emerging markets. In 1999, memories were fresh of the Asian currency crisis and Russian default, which scared some investors away. There was also talk of a "digital divide," in which the rich countries would profit from the Internet while poorer ones could not afford the needed infrastructure.
As it happened, the lessons of the Asian currency crisis served many emerging countries well, by encouraging them to amass large reserves of foreign currency, principally dollars. To do that, they sought to keep their currencies undervalued to encourage exports, and as a group they succeeded.
In the United States, and to some extent Europe, the end of the technology stock bubble brought on a recession, which was worsened by the reaction to the shock of Sept. 11, 2001. The Fed responded by driving interest rates to historic lows and keeping them there longer than now appears to have been wise.
Low interest rates stimulated consumer demand and caused Americans to buy more things, many of them imported. At the same time, the low rates, combined with a lowering of credit standards by mortgage issuers, caused home prices to soar, providing more consumer spending power as homeowners refinanced their loans and extracted equity.
When the party stopped in America, many emerging countries were well equipped to deal with the sudden difficulty in finding loans. With large foreign currency reserves, they were lenders, not borrowers.
The MSCI world indexes have a relatively short history, but the similar Standard & Poor's 500-stock index in the United States dates back to 1928. The decade of the zeros was the first decade ever that the S.&. P. 500 had a negative total return. Prices fell in the 1930s, but dividends moved the index narrowly into positive territory.
Bring on the teens. Please.

Full text: Never before has Europe's monetary union seemed so fragile.
Day by day, fears are growing that Greece or another weak country may default on its sovereign debt obligations, forcing the richer countries in Europe to ride to the rescue or risk having one or more of its most vulnerable members leave the 16-nation euro zone.
Many European economists discount such a fracture as a remote possibility. But that doesn't mean Europe has safely emerged from crisis.
Instead, it faces a longer-term challenge to restore the fiscal credibility of at least half the countries that use the euro. The true test for the world's largest common currency zone, analysts say, will be whether it can withstand the economic, political and social strains once the European Central Bank begins to raise interest rates in response to economic improvements in Germany, France and other Northern European countries.
At that point, the laggards on the union's fringe -- Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece and Spain (the so-called Piigs) -- will face even tougher choices to cope with what looks like several more years of stagnant economies, high unemployment and gaping budget deficits.
"If inflation picks up in France and Germany, the smaller economies will be left behind in stagnation and deflation," said Jordi Gali, a Spanish economist recognized for his work on business cycles who heads the Center for Research in International Economics in Barcelona. "Such an asymmetric recovery is pretty likely, and if the E.C.B. raises rates, it could get very ugly."
Mr. Gali, like a number of other European experts, takes the view that the euro zone's resilience has been underestimated. He says the recent convulsions are more the result of trigger-happy ratings agencies that have downgraded the sovereign debt of Greece and others in atonement for having failed to foresee the subprime mortgage crisis.
Still, he says, there is no escaping this emerging growth divide, and he points out that the mandate of the European Central Bank is to ensure broad price stability in the union, not to look out for the interests of individual nations.
France and Germany have already emerged from the recession. Business confidence in Germany, Europe's largest economy, hit a 17-month high last week.
Yet on the periphery, the hangover from more than five years of a credit-infused boom shows little sign of diminishing.
Ireland, the first economy to stumble, has taken the most severe fiscal action, cutting public wages sharply. A new Greek government, punished by the rough treatment of bond investors no longer willing to countenance soft promises of reform, is just now promising steep spending cuts. But it is not clear whether the political system in Greece will accept them.
Meanwhile, Spain, to the frustration of many major lenders, seems to be putting off difficult fiscal questions in the hope that its economy will soon recover.
Critics of the euro zone contend that weak governments in the peripheral economies, facing high unemployment and restive voters, will not have the stomach to hold down wages, pensions and public expenditures.
"Are these people serious about reform, or are they just telling people what they want to hear?" asked Edward Hugh, a British-trained macroeconomist who lives in Barcelona and has been critical of Spain's unwillingness to take difficult economic decisions.
The very dysfunction of a struggling two-tier Europe may represent the best chance for recovery if it leads to devaluation of the euro against the dollar, which many see as long overdue.
Already, in the last month, the euro has lost more than 5 percent of its value against the dollar. Many economists predict that the currency will weaken more as the growth gap between the core and peripheral states creates further disharmony.
Then, it will be the type of export-led recovery that has helped the United States and is likely to soon help Britain that could bring Europe's economies closer to convergence.
"If there are fears now that a breakup of the euro zone will lead to weakening of the euro, then that is good news," said Paul De Grauwe, an economist based in Brussels who advises the president of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso. "So we should congratulate Greece for getting us out of this anomaly of having a euro that is too overvalued."
Any such recovery will not be rapid, however. In Ireland, where prices are falling by 5 percent, reordering the economy from its deep reliance on construction and property will take years. And an already unpopular Irish government, along with others on Europe's periphery, will have a difficult time explaining to recession-bruised voters why they must accept an central bank's decision to raise interest rates -- a move that may protect German and French savers from inflation but that does little for the many millions of citizens out of work.
Yet the painful, historic steps taken by Ireland offer a ray of hope, says Philip Lane, a professor of international macroeconomics at Trinity College Dublin who oversees the widely read Irish Economy blog.
He points to signs of wage compression in the hard-hit service, property and government sectors as proof that there is a recognition that recovery, distant as it may seem, must occur inside the euro zone, not outside.
"It takes a crisis to learn a lesson," Mr. Lane said. "Could it be that by getting countries to change their behavior you might get improved cooperation within the euro zone?
"What does not kill you," he added, "often makes you stronger."

Full text: For the first time in modern stock market history, investors in United States equities are likely to finish a decade empty-handed. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is set to provide a negative 0.8 percent average annual total return. Even the grim 1930s did better. While share prices fell, dividends made the average total return positive, by 1 percent a year.
Investors may bemoan their misfortune, especially when they consider annual inflation of 2.5 percent in the period, compared to annual deflation of 2 percent in the 1930s. But they can take two small comforts.
First, it could have been worse. By Japanese standards, the United States technology stock bubble that inflated share prices at the beginning of the decade was just a baby frenzy. The Nikkei index is still only at a quarter of its all time high, hit two decades ago.
Second, shareholders actually got more cash out of the companies than shown in the statistics from S. & P., which oversees the benchmark index. The calculations do not include share buybacks, but these push money to equity holders in much the same way that dividends do. And in 7 of the last 10 years buybacks have been larger than dividends, almost double from 2005 to 2007.
Over the last generation, regular dividends have increasingly been considered passe. Thirty years ago, 94 percent of S.& P. 500 companies sent quarterly checks to their shareholders. Last year, 74 percent did, according to S.& P.
Many companies sticking with tradition have been more miserly. Since 1936, companies have paid an average of 53 percent of their earnings in dividends. Over the last decade, they have offered 46 percent.
After this meager decade, a steady flow of cash in the hand looks a lot better than potential capital gains in the bush. In financial theory, assuming equalized tax rates, the two have identical value. In practice, though, a relatively steady dividend payout reduces investment risk and keeps corporate executives from taking too many big bets on risky investments and acquisitions.
It's time for dividends to come back into fashion.
Cutting Their Losses
Why bother? That's the question more underwater Americans are asking themselves about their mortgages. Trapped in the abyss of negative equity, more will decide to quit paying. That would be a rational response.
About a quarter of all mortgages in the United States are on houses that are worth less than the unpaid balance of the loan, according to the real estate consultant First American CoreLogic. About half of that group, 5.3 million borrowers, are 20 percent or more underwater. For 2.2 million, the property is worth less than half the mortgage balance.
Those folks are called homeowners, but home borrowers would be more accurate. All they own is an obligation to whatever entity services their mortgage. They're essentially renters paying more than market prices for their habitat.
That ownership tag is often felt to be important. And Americans trained to believe that a mortgage is a moral obligation fear punishment or a guilty conscience if they walk away.
But foreclosure is hardly the mark of Cain, especially in states like California and Arizona where lenders have no practical recourse to pursue a borrower's other assets.
As more homeowners underwater realize there's no hope to regain their equity, more will reasonably seek to cut their losses. The reduction of liabilities brings immediate debt relief and often a lower cash outlay -- on rent -- for comparable housing. The financial shot in the arm should outweigh the stigma of foreclosure.
Financial self-interest is likely to be contagious. A study by three economists suggests that when a few borrowers in a neighborhood just say no, others are likely to do the same.
Lenders do what they can to keep economic rationality from spreading. They try to extend and pretend with lower interest rates, longer terms, and the pretense that eventually the borrower will make good. They will do anything to avoid the hit to capital that comes from a write-down of the principal.
Until now, borrower guilt has helped protect bank balance sheets. That is likely to change and usher in a new, painful chapter of the financial crisis.
