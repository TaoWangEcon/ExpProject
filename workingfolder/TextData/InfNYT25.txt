Full text:   Fifty years have passed since Lyndon Johnson declared war on poverty. And a funny thing happened on the way to this anniversary. Suddenly, or so it seems, progressives have stopped apologizing for their efforts on behalf of the poor, and have started trumpeting them instead. And conservatives find themselves on the defensive.
It wasn't supposed to be this way. For a long time, everyone knew -- or, more accurately, "knew" -- that the war on poverty had been an abject failure. And they knew why: It was the fault of the poor themselves. But what everyone knew wasn't true, and the public seems to have caught on.
The narrative went like this: Antipoverty programs hadn't actually reduced poverty, because poverty in America was basically a social problem -- a problem of broken families, crime and a culture of dependence that was only reinforced by government aid. And because this narrative was so widely accepted, bashing the poor was good politics, enthusiastically embraced by Republicans and some Democrats, too.
Yet this view of poverty, which may have had some truth to it in the 1970s, bears no resemblance to anything that has happened since.
For one thing, the war on poverty has, in fact, achieved quite a lot. It's true that the standard measure of poverty hasn't fallen much. But this measure doesn't include the value of crucial public programs like food stamps and the earned-income tax credit. Once these programs are taken into account, the data show a significant decline in poverty, and a much larger decline in extreme poverty. Other evidence also points to a big improvement in the lives of America's poor: lower-income Americans are much healthier and better-nourished than they were in the 1960s.
Furthermore, there is strong evidence that antipoverty programs have long-term benefits, both to their recipients and to the nation as a whole. For example, children who had access to food stamps were healthier and had higher incomes in later life than people who didn't.
And if progress against poverty has nonetheless been disappointingly slow -- which it has -- blame rests not with the poor but with a changing labor market, one that no longer offers good wages to ordinary workers. Wages used to rise along with worker productivity, but that linkage ended around 1980. The bottom third of the American work force has seen little or no rise in inflation-adjusted wages since the early 1970s; the bottom third of male workers has experienced a sharp wage decline. This wage stagnation, not social decay, is the reason poverty has proved so hard to eradicate.
Or to put it a different way, the problem of poverty has become part of the broader problem of rising income inequality, of an economy in which all the fruits of growth seem to go to a small elite, leaving everyone else behind.
So how should we respond to this reality?
The conservative position, essentially, is that we shouldn't respond. Conservatives are committed to the view that government is always the problem, never the solution; they treat every beneficiary of a safety-net program as if he or she were "a Cadillac-driving welfare queen." And why not? After all, for decades their position was a political winner, because middle-class Americans saw "welfare" as something that Those People got but they didn't.
But that was then. At this point, the rise of the 1 percent at the expense of everyone else is so obvious that it's no longer possible to shut down any discussion of rising inequality with cries of "class warfare." Meanwhile, hard times have forced many more Americans to turn to safety-net programs. And as conservatives have responded by defining an ever-growing fraction of the population as morally unworthy "takers" -- a quarter, a third, 47 percent, whatever -- they have made themselves look callous and meanspirited.
You can see the new political dynamics at work in the fight over aid to the unemployed. Republicans are still opposed to extended benefits, despite high long-term unemployment. But they have, revealingly, changed their arguments. Suddenly, it's not about forcing those lazy bums to find jobs; it's about fiscal responsibility. And nobody believes a word of it.
Meanwhile, progressives are on offense. They have decided that inequality is a winning political issue. They see war-on-poverty programs like food stamps, Medicaid, and the earned-income tax credit as success stories, initiatives that have helped Americans in need -- especially during the slump since 2007 -- and should be expanded. And if these programs enroll a growing number of Americans, rather than being narrowly targeted on the poor, so what?
So guess what: On its 50th birthday, the war on poverty no longer looks like a failure. It looks, instead, like a template for a rising, increasingly confident progressive movement.

Full text:   Ray Dalio's Bridgewater Associates, one of the world's biggest hedge fund firms, had a largely lackluster year when it came to the performance of its two main portfolios.
The firm's Pure Alpha fund, with $80 billion in assets, rose 5.25 percent in 2013. But Bridgewater's All Weather fund, with $70 billion in assets, ended the year down 3.9 percent, said a person briefed on the numbers but not authorized to discuss them.
In theory, an investor who allocated an equal amount of dollars to the two Bridgewater funds ended last year with a roughly flat return.
Bridgewater's performance is underwhelming in comparison to the American stock market. The broader market in 2013 posted its best gains since the 1990s, with the benchmark Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rising 30 percent.
The performance of the two Bridgewater portfolios also lagged far behind hedge fund peers, which on average, posted a 9 percent gain last year.
The All Weather fund, which invests heavily in bonds, including Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS, underperformed the Barclays Aggregate Index, a widely followed bond index, which ended the year down 2.03 percent.
The fund also fared slightly worse than a Bank of America index, which tracks the total returns on all United States government bonds and which fell 3.2 percent.
The rough year for Bridgewater is a blow to Mr. Dalio's reputation as one of Wall Street's most savvy money managers and whose views on global economic trends are closely monitored. The firm's funds rank as some of the largest in the $2.2 trillion hedge fund industry and are a favorite investment for many public and corporate pensions and sovereign wealth funds.
One reason Bridgewater has managed to attract so much money from institutional investors is the firm's history of producing steady, although not necessarily spectacular, performance in its main portfolios. Including last year, Pure Alpha has generated an average 14.4 percent return for investors in each of the last five years, while the All Weather fund has returned an average of 12.4 percent over the same time period.
Last year proved particularly challenging for Bridgewater's All Weather fund, which is supposed to perform best when there is a sharp sell-off in either stocks or bonds. The fund help popularize the so-called risk-parity trade, which uses a combination of investments in bonds and stocks to try to adjust for a variety of economic situations such as rising or falling inflation, and rising or falling growth.
A number of risk-parity funds like All Weather were caught off guard by a sudden rise in Treasury yields last summer. Treasury yields began to rise last May after speculation began that the Federal Reserve would soon scale back its monthly purchases of United States Treasury's and mortgage-backed securities. The Fed began slowly scaling back its purchases, which are intended to stoke economic growth, last month.
Last year also was a particularly rough one for TIPS and other inflation-protected securities. TIPS tend to perform poorly when Treasury yields rise and inflation is low. Last year, iShares TIPS, an exchange traded fund that tracks the inflation-protected securities market, fell about 9 percent.
In the coming weeks, Mr. Dalio is expected to release to investors his widely followed year-end investor letter, a lengthy dossier that not only will take a look at 2013 but also offer his outlook for 2014.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text:   What a spectacular year was 2013.
Markets boomed. Stocks hit a record, with the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index up almost 30 percent, the best performance in almost 16 years. Capital-raising is back, baby, with initial public offerings, like the one for Twitter, giving us that sweet 1990s feeling all over again. Investment banks had a great year.
In previous eras, all of this might have been enthusiastically celebrated. Street vendors would break out Dow 16,000 hats. The chief executive of Snapchat would be named Time magazine's man of the year, children's division. The media would serve up adulatory profiles of successful investors, glorious winners, implying they had achieved something close to heroic.
This time around, reaction is tempered. We are older and more jaded. It's almost as if we are displaying wisdom.
Well, maybe that goes too far, but at a minimum, people know not to be too excited. Today, these successes are underscored with three vital observations: that the exuberance could just as easily disappear, leaving a crash in its wake; that strong capital markets don't necessarily signify a strong economy; and that the gains are unequal.
Sadly, those hard lessons had to be won by living through two huge bubbles, stagnating wages and an economy suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome.
First, the most widely and easily grasped lesson. There is an innate skepticism about the stock market. Investors and the media voice a steady undercurrent of concern about high valuations. I did research on the news search service Factiva for mentions of the "Dow Jones industrial average" and "bubble," comparing 2013 with the great bubble year of 1999. Last year, 1,832 articles shared both terms, while in 1999, there were only 1,342.
Perhaps we are not in a bubble today -- it's something that doesn't have a clear definition, after all. Perhaps in many of those articles, bubbles are mentioned only to dismiss the notion that we are experiencing one. Perhaps investors in those articles are invoking the cliché that stocks have more room to rise because they can climb the proverbial wall of worry. (In investing circles, markets are due to rise if there is a sufficient number of worried people on the sidelines, holding their money back.) No matter. It's a good sign that bubble-caution lines the intestines of investors and the media.
Bubble-consciousness means that investors, the media and the public may finally be mistrustful. Considering how treacherous the markets are, that mistrust is warranted.
In more financially naïve times, the stock market served as shorthand, a neat little number that told us whether the United States had a good day or poor one, depending on whether the market went up or down. That antiquated notion has been more or less retired. Now, when we see the markets doing well, we understand that it has little to tell us about the broader economy. Large publicly traded companies make up a small portion of the overall economy, and large portions of their profits come from overseas. The Dow Jones industrial average accounts for a relatively small sliver of employment and wages. Today, job growth remains weak, while the portion of employment-age workers is low. The stock market is not us.
So as companies' profits zoom upward, we react more cautiously. Last year, corporate profit margins were about twice as high as where they have been on average since World War II, according to the economist Mark Zandi. Investors care about whether those margins are sustainable. Investors think about margins relative to the price of stocks.
But the public -- especially the non-stock-investing portion -- doesn't. Today, the public cares more about the other side of the corporate equation: wages. Median income hasn't gone up in more than a decade and is actually down from the late 1990s, when adjusted for inflation. Those rising profits reflect companies' success in keeping labor costs low.
Investment banking fees rose 3 percent, to almost $80 billion globally, the best year since 2007, according to Thomson Reuters. I need not remind you that was the year before the crash. Bonuses for traders and bankers will provide plenty of rolling-on-a-pile-of-money time. The bonuses will be especially lucrative for those paid in deferred stock of their own banks, the current solution to linking pay to performance.
But again, we understand how to interpret that. High profits at financial firms mean that someone, somewhere has taken on added risk. And it also means that we have a simple number to use when assessing how seriously to take the constant whining from bankers about how governments are regulating them out of existence and threatening our capitalist way of life.
The wealth of billionaires soared. In a measure of 300 billionaires, Bloomberg News calculated that they added more than half a trillion dollars to their fortunes last year for an aggregate total of $3.7 trillion. Today, no longer is the 1 percent viewed through the prism of celebration and envy. Now, wealth is inextricably linked to income inequality. Half of the United States population is either poor or "near poor," according to census statistics.
We haven't solved the problems of depressed employment and wages, widening income inequality or inequitable economic growth. But at least we are beginning to define the issues correctly. The interesting test will be whether the lessons we seem to have learned will stick this time. Or will these niggling complications invading our prosperity be sloughed off as the markets continue to rise?

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve's decision in December to taper its bond-buying campaign reflected increased confidence in the economy and continued uneasiness about the stimulus effort, according to an official account of the December meeting.
The retreat, however, is likely to proceed slowly. The account, published on Wednesday, said most Fed officials still regarded the monthly purchases of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities as effective in stimulating job growth. With unemployment still widespread, it said they saw little justification for completing the retreat from bond buying "now or relatively soon."
The Fed plans to expand its bond holdings by $75 billion this month, down from $85 billion each month last year, and officials have suggested a similar cut is the most likely result when the Fed's policy-making committee next meets in late January.
The Fed's path forward is a final compromise forged by its outgoing chairman, Ben S. Bernanke. Some Fed officials worry that the economy needs still more help; others argue that the Fed already is doing more harm than good.
Mr. Bernanke, who will step down at the end of the month, predicted in June that the Fed would decide to taper by the end of the year, and it did.
"Participants generally anticipated that the improvement in labor market conditions would continue, and most had become more confident in that outlook," the account said. "Against this backdrop, most participants saw a reduction in the pace of purchases as appropriate at this meeting and consistent with the committee's previous policy communications."
The next wave of decisions will be made under new leadership. The Senate confirmed the Fed's vice chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, as Mr. Bernanke's successor earlier this week. She will lead her first meeting of the Fed's policy-making committee in March. While Ms. Yellen has expressed concerns about the labor market, she supported the decision to start tempering the stimulus efforts.
Fed officials are increasingly confident that the economy will grow more quickly in 2014. In part, the outlook is improving because there is no sign that the federal government is planning another round of spending cuts, which have slowed economic growth in recent years.
The account noted that the economy has added a monthly average of 190,000 jobs over the last 15 months, and officials expect those numbers to increase.
The Commerce Department plans on Friday to release employment data for December. Analysts expect the economy added 195,000 jobs last month.
Eric S. Rosengren, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, was the sole dissenter at the December meeting. "I do not yet have sufficient confidence in this outlook to risk the removal of any monetary accommodation at this time," he said then.
But even Mr. Rosengren's view of the economy has since brightened. He told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday that he was reconciled to reducing bond purchases in $10 billion increments, though he cautioned against an increase in the pace of the retreat.
"I'm comfortable with the current approach that it looks like we're going to be following through on," he said.
Still, the minutes of the December meeting reflected lingering concern among Fed officials about two exceptions to the theme of recovery. The pace of price increases has remained sluggish, and the share of adults in the labor force has fallen.
Prices increased by 0.9 percent over the 12 months ending in November, according to the most recent data from the Fed's preferred inflation measure, the Commerce Department's index of personal consumption expenditures. That pace is well below the Fed's 2 percent target, and Fed officials predict that inflation in 2014 will once again fall well short of that target.
In a statement published after its December meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee said that it was watching inflation closely even as it reduced its support for the economy. Fed officials continue to predict that inflation will return to normal levels over the next several years, and they note that asset prices tied to inflation still reflect a similar expectation.
The account said that some officials noted that prices for health care and financial services had climbed particularly slowly in recent years, holding down the overall rate of price increases, and they predicted that would prove transitory.
Other officials, however, "raised the possibility that recent declines in inflation might suggest that the economic recovery was not as strong as some thought," according to the minutes of the meeting.
Fed officials also disagreed about the decline in labor force participation. The unemployment rate has decreased steadily over the last several years, reaching a new postrecession low of 7 percent in November, but that is largely because fewer people are looking for work. Job growth has kept pace with population growth; the share of adults with jobs has not increased.
Some Fed officials say they see reduced participation as a direct result of the recession, and they argue that the Fed therefore must look beyond the unemployment rate in judging the need for additional stimulus. Others point to demographic explanations, like more workers reaching retirement age. Or they argue that monetary policy lacks the power to draw people back to work.
The issue is likely to gain in importance as the Fed winds down its asset purchases. The central bank is expected to focus on the measure it regards as the core of its stimulus campaign, its declared intention to hold short-term interest rates near zero at least as long as the jobless rate remains above 6.5 percent. The Fed has said that it plans to keep rates near zero after that threshold is crossed. How much longer will rest in part on its conclusions about its power to increase labor force participation.

Abstract: On Wednesday, Zekeriya Oz, the former chief prosecutor of Istanbul, who began the investigation and was eventually dismissed under government pressure, said he had been threatened by two men from the prime minister's office who had demanded that he write a letter of apology to Mr. Erdogan, The Hurriyet Daily News reported.

Full text:   The Turkish government reshuffled the police force yet again overnight, the police said on Wednesday, and sought to expand its power over the judiciary in a move that one former justice minister likened to a coup.
Analysts said both actions appeared calculated to fend off a widening corruption investigation that has plunged the government of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan into its worst crisis since it came to power more than a decade ago.
The investigation, which has linked senior politicians to murky business deals, has resulted in the resignation of three ministers, whose sons are under suspicion, as well as a fourth minister. It centers on accusations that officials took bribes in return for bending zoning rules. Turks have been riveted by lurid details leaked to the news media, like the discovery of $4.5 million in cash stuffed in shoe boxes at the home of the director of a state bank.
Mr. Erdogan's government sent draft legislation to Parliament late Tuesday that would enhance its limited control over the High Council of Judges and Prosecutors, which is responsible for judicial functions, including appointments. The proposed law would grant the justice minister greater authority over legal discipline, judicial investigations, and the appointment of judges and prosecutors, powers the minister does not now have.
Analysts said the legislation would severely undermine the separation between the executive and judiciary branches, and undercut the judicial independence set out in a constitutional change supported by Mr. Erdogan's government in a referendum in 2010.
"With this legislation, the government is launching an operation of revenge against the High Council of Judges and Prosecutors," Hikmet Sami Turk, a former justice minister from a leftist opposition party, said in an interview. "The prime minister has regarded the graft probe as a judicial coup against his government, so now, with this legislation, his government launches a countercoup against the judiciary."
But Bekir Bozdag, the current justice minister, was quoted by CNN Turk television on Wednesday as saying that the draft legislation was compatible with the Constitution, and that the High Council in its current form had too much power. "Even the Parliament does not have the power and authority that the council has," Mr. Bozdag said.
The government also demoted or reassigned police chiefs in 15 cities and the deputy head of Turkey's police force, the police said in a statement on Wednesday. The latest removals came after around 350 Turkish police officers in Ankara, the capital, were reassigned on Tuesday in the largest single overhaul of the police force since the corruption inquiry came to light last month. The government had already removed more than a dozen high-ranking police officials.
On Wednesday, Zekeriya Oz, the former chief prosecutor of Istanbul, who began the investigation and was eventually dismissed under government pressure, said he had been threatened by two men from the prime minister's office who had demanded that he write a letter of apology to Mr. Erdogan, The Hurriyet Daily News reported.
Mr. Erdogan's office quickly denied Mr. Oz's allegation. "It is out of discussion that our prime minister would have sent some people from senior judiciary, or anybody else, regarding the matter," the semiofficial Anadolu Agency said late Wednesday, citing unidentified officials from Mr. Erdogan's office. "This claim, as in our prime minister's own words, is outright slander."
Efforts by the government that are apparently aimed at stymieing the inquiry threaten Turkey's prospects of joining the European Union. The government's proposal to expand its authority over judges and prosecutors drew criticism from a senior European official.
The official, Nils Muiznieks, commissioner for human rights on the Council of Europe, wrote on Twitter, "Proposals to curb powers of High Council of Judges and Prosecutors represent serious setback for the independence of the judiciary in Turkey." The Council of Europe is a governmental group founded in 1949 to promote human rights on the Continent.
Turkey has been struggling to restart its negotiations to become part of the 28-member union, even as it shifts its focus toward its restive Middle Eastern neighbors. Current members of the union express doubts about admitting a large Muslim country like Turkey, and their doubts were further fanned last summer during the Erdogan administration's bloody clampdown on protesters in Taksim Square in Istanbul.
The crisis also threatens to undermine the country's economy by, among other things, alarming foreign investors when inflation is already rising and the Turkish lira has fallen. Fitch Ratings warned on Tuesday that the corruption scandal could damage Turkey's credit rating and economic stability. The finance minister, Mehmet Simsek, said the inquiry could undermine short-term growth.
Any economic fallout would be a particular blow to Mr. Erdogan, who has sought to build economic ties with Europe and the Middle East and to fashion Turkey as a regional economic powerhouse attractive to foreign investors.
Turkey's main opposition leader, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, said on Tuesday that Mr. Erdogan would eventually face judgment for his role in the scandal. He added that the prime minister was pushing the bounds of his authority by seeking to expand the government's role in appointing judges and prosecutors.
"He can't have such an authority. He can't judge. Judges do this," Mr. Kilicdaroglu told a parliamentary group meeting of his Republican People's Party, according to The Hurriyet Daily News.
Hugh Pope, a leading expert on Turkey, said in an interview with Strategic Europe, a journal of the research institute Carnegie Europe, that the corruption crisis could, paradoxically, help foster a more constructive foreign policy in Turkey as Mr. Erdogan seeks to offset internal turmoil by repairing frayed relations with countries like Iran and Iraq. He has also set the stage to end a bitter feud with Israel that had dismayed the United States.

Full text:   PARIS -- Europe's labor market remained stagnant in November, but analysts saw reason for hope elsewhere in the economy, including a surge in retail sales.
The unemployment rate in the euro zone stood at 12.1 percent, a stubbornly high level that has held since April, Eurostat, the European Union's statistics agency, reported on Wednesday.
As the sovereign debt crisis seized the region and economic malaise set in, the jobless rose from just under 10 percent in early 2011 to the current record level. The November rate was in line with economists' expectations.
For the full European Union, made up of 28 member states, the jobless rate was unchanged at 10.9 percent. Eurostat estimated that 26.6 million people across Europe were unemployed and seeking work, 19,000 more than in October.
More than five years after the implosion of Lehman Brothers in 2008 triggered a global financial collapse, Europe's economy remains on fragile footing. Lending to businesses is contracting, and investment is weak.
There were indications, though, that the labor market might be lagging the broader economy.
A separate report from Eurostat showed that euro zone retail sales rose 1.4 percent in November from a month earlier, when they had dropped by 0.4 percent. In Berlin, the Economy Ministry reported that orders for German factories rebounded by 2.1 percent in November from October, when they suffered a decline of a similar size.
Taken together, the data show that "the euro zone economy is growing modestly," said Christian Schulz, an economist at Berenberg Bank in London. "The labor market is stabilizing, and retail sales are rebounding nicely." That, he said, suggests that "the decline in domestic demand is over."
Other hopeful signs have emerged in Europe lately.
A survey of purchasing managers by Markit Economics showed output near the highest it had been for two and a half years. Ireland experienced strong demand upon its return to the international bond market Tuesday after exiting its bailout. The Irish government sold 3.75 billion euros, or about $5.1 billion, of 10-year bonds priced to yield just 3.543 percent, with more than four-fifths of the demand coming from overseas investors.
Ireland isn't the only euro zone nation to find the bond market more hospitable. At the height of the sovereign debt crisis, officials had feared that Spain and Italy would be forced to seek bailouts because their borrowing costs were becoming unsustainable. But yields on Italian and Spanish government debt have fallen sharply from their peaks, to well below 4 percent -- welcome news for countries that will be tapping the market for hundreds of billions of euros for refinancing this year.
Because bond yields move inversely with prices, lower yields signal that investors are demanding more of the debt. Even hapless Greece has benefited, with yields on its debt falling below 8 percent, the lowest level in more than three years.
Still, the outlook for economic growth for the region remains anemic.
Richard Barwell, an economist in London with Royal Bank of Scotland, estimated before the jobless data were released that the euro zone's gross domestic product grew by just 0.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2013. That would be equivalent to a 0.8 percent annualized rate.
Mr. Barwell forecasts that the euro zone will manage quarterly growth of about 0.3 percent in the first quarter of the new year.
Mr. Schulz said the jobless data revealed that labor markets in Ireland and Portugal, two countries that were battered by the sovereign debt crisis, were improving. He suggested that Spain might also be in the early stages of a rebound, citing national data showing jobless registrations falling in December.
Among the lowest unemployment rates in Europe were Austria's 4.8 percent and Germany's 5.2 percent. Greece showed the highest rate, 27.4 percent, though it is several months behind in its reporting.
The November unemployment rate in the United States was 7 percent, although it is measured slightly differently.
There were 17 euro zone members in the period when the latest jobs data were tabulated. Eurostat will begin including information for the newest member, Latvia, which joined at the start of the year, in the January data.
Markets reacted calmly to the latest data, with the Euro Stoxx 50 index of euro zone blue-chip companies little changed.
The latest reports arrived on the eve of a policy meeting of the European Central Bank's Governing Council. The bank surprised markets in November by cutting its benchmark interest rate to 0.25 percent from 0.5 percent, and economists say it is too soon to expect the bank to move on rates again this week.
But the jobless data, and the danger of deflation, will be important topics for discussion in Frankfurt. Consumer prices in the euro zone rose in December at an annual rate of only 0.8 percent, Eurostat reported on Tuesday -- far below the E.C.B.'s inflation target of less than, but close to, 2 percent.

Full text:   PARIS -- Consumer prices in the euro zone barely increased last month, raising fears of deflation and putting pressure on the European Central Bank to take further action.
Prices in the 17 European Union member states that were using the euro in 2013 rose in December at an annual rate of only 0.8 percent, Eurostat, the European Union statistical agency, reported on Tuesday in a first estimate that will be subject to revision in the weeks ahead. The December figure, which did not include Latvia since it adopted the euro on Jan. 1, was slightly lower than the 0.9 percent annual inflation rate for November.
The European Central Bank seeks to keep price growth steady at about 2 percent. The situation now, in which the rate of inflation is falling, is known as disinflation. If the situation continues in this direction, Europe could face outright deflation -- a debilitating economic condition in which prices actually decline across the board.
As long as hints of deflation remain, the E.C.B. faces a difficult challenge.
Economists do not, for the most part, expect the E.C.B. to take action when its Governing Council meets on Thursday in Frankfurt. But the issue is certain to figure prominently in discussions between the bank's president, Mario Draghi, and his colleagues.
Most worrisome to economists assessing the data released on Tuesday is the "core" inflation rate, which strips out volatile food and energy prices. It dipped to 0.7 percent -- a record low since the advent of the euro currency. The core number for December was equivalent to the broader, overall figure for October that led the E.C.B. to cut its benchmark interest rate to a record low of 0.25 percent, down from 0.5 percent.
Clemente De Lucia, an economist at BNP Paribas, said on Tuesday that the December consumer price data might have been affected by a change in the way Germany calculated its inflation, so another month or two might be needed to be certain of the trend.
"Yet, the level of inflation remains dangerously low," he wrote in a note. "Survey data show that the recovery is gaining some momentum. Yet its pace will remain rather low and it needs to be sustained by policy maker actions."
Data for all of the euro zone members is not yet available, but there is significant variation in price trends within the zone. Germany, for example, posted inflation of 1.2 percent in December. But Cyprus, hammered by the collapse of its financial industry, is already experiencing deflation, as prices slipped 2.3 percent in December.
Spain's consumer prices rose just 0.3 percent, while Italy's rose only 0.2 percent, as those two countries' troubled economies teetered near a deflationary cliff.
Deflation would only add to the broader economic malaise in the region, by hurting corporate profits and by leading consumers to delay purchases in anticipation of better deals in the future. It would also weigh heavily on borrowers, making loan repayments more expensive in real terms -- a particular danger for Europe's already fragile financial sector.
In the view of at least one outside observer, Europe's deflationary pressure may be a symptom of a larger problem, in which austerity measures and imbalances among countries in the region have hampered growth. Jacob J. Lew, the United States Treasury secretary, said on Tuesday at a news conference in Paris that Europe needed to focus more on investment and stimulating demand, suggesting that the Continent's most powerful economic engine, Germany, should take the lead.
"It's clear that some countries have more capacity to stimulate growth and demand than others do," Mr. Lew said, in a clear reference to Germany.
"Short-term demand has to be part of the agenda," added Mr. Lew, who is on the Continent this week for talks with government leaders and finance officials in Paris, Berlin and Lisbon. "It's too important to look at a single economic statistic."
Mr. Draghi has suggested that the bank's toolbox for addressing falling prices has not been exhausted, and includes the possibility of enacting negative interest rates -- in effect, punishing commercial banks for depositing funds at the central bank. The goal of such a move would be to force banks to pump more money into the economy in the form of lending, which could have at least a mild inflationary effect.

Abstract: A prominent bond trader who was hired to revitalize Morgan Stanley's trading business but whose division racked up sizable losses has left the Wall Street firm.

Full text:   A prominent bond trader who was hired to revitalize Morgan Stanley's trading business but whose division racked up sizable losses has left the Wall Street firm.
The trader, Glenn Hadden, was head of global rates, an important operation that trades government bonds and other instruments. He left Morgan Stanley on Monday after three years at the firm, according to a company memo. Morgan Stanley's senior management asked Mr. Hadden, one of the bank's highest-paid executives, to resign, according to a person briefed on the matter.
"After three years at the firm, Glenn Hadden will be leaving Morgan Stanley to pursue other opportunities," said a company memo written by Michael Heaney and Robert Rooney, the executives who oversaw Mr. Hadden. "We would like to thank Glenn for his contributions to the Global Rates business and wish him well in his future endeavors." Mr. Heaney and Mr. Rooney head up Morgan Stanley's fixed-income business, which generates large amounts of revenue from trading bonds and other instruments.
Mr. Hadden's departure closes an intriguing chapter in Morgan Stanley's efforts since the financial crisis to strike the right balance in its fixed-income operations. After bond trading became the source of enormous losses during the crisis, Morgan Stanley immediately dialed back its risk-taking in the division. Not long after that retreat, however, the bank made efforts to reassert itself, in part because fixed income can produce hefty profits when markets aren't in a state of high stress.
Mr. Hadden's hiring was meant to play an important part in this rebuilding. Under his leadership, the global rates division increased business with clients and posted some strong financial results, particularly in 2012.
But Mr. Hadden, known for his ability to consume copious amounts of Gatorade at work, also brought controversy and trading losses.
Before joining Morgan Stanley in early 2011, Mr. Hadden worked for many years at Goldman Sachs. In 2009, Goldman put Mr. Hadden on leave after it had concerns about some of his trading. This included trading in Treasury futures that took place in December 2008 and was later found to violate CME Group rules. Last year, the CME Group, which runs exchanges where interest rates and bonds are traded, fined Mr. Hadden $80,000 and suspended him from CME trading for 10 days. Goldman was ordered to pay $850,000.
A disciplinary action of this nature would not normally be enough to lead to the departure of a prominent trader. But Mr. Hadden's operations also produced losses that most likely weakened his position at the firm.
In 2011, Mr. Hadden's division was hit by a wager on United States inflation expectations that led to a loss of tens of millions of dollars, according to people briefed on the transactions. After that, Morgan Stanley executives stepped up their supervision of Mr. Hadden's activities. Even so, in the first half of 2013, his division was hurt by losses that exceeded $200 million.
Like other Wall Street firms, Morgan Stanley is trying to improve its profitability, as measured by a metric called return on equity.
Two fixed-income executives, Jakob Horder and Mitch Nadel, have immediately replaced Mr. Hadden as the co-heads of global rates.
"In their new roles, Jakob and Mitch will focus on aligning the strategy of Global Rates with the other business units in Fixed Income, with an intense focus on return on equity," Mr. Rooney and Mr. Heaney wrote in their memo.

Abstract: Both policies generate welfare gains for all generations in the United States, but particularly for young and future workers. [...]all Americans can benefit, though by less, if foreign countries also cut their corporate tax rates. Fully eliminating the corporate income tax and replacing any loss in revenues with somewhat higher personal income tax rates leads to a huge short-run inflow of capital, raising the United States' capital stock (machines and buildings) by 23 percent, output by 8 percent and the real wages of unskilled and skilled workers by 12 percent.

Full text:   BOSTON -- JOBS don't grow out of thin air, especially well-paying ones. They require, among other things, companies that are willing to operate where you live. Just ask the Seattle-based District 751 of the machinists' union, which was worried that Boeing will build its new 777X airliner someplace far away where it is cheaper to produce. Last month the union offered contract concessions, as its president explained, to ensure "the long-term success" of Boeing in Washington State. And on Friday, Boeing machinists approved a contract with concessions to keep assembly of the plane in the area.
In recent decades, American workers have suffered one body blow after another: the decline in manufacturing, foreign competition, outsourcing, the Great Recession and smart machines that replace people everywhere you look. Amazon and Google are in a horse race to see how many humans they can put out of work with self-guided delivery drones and driverless cars. You wonder who will be left with incomes to buy what these robots deliver.
What can workers do to mitigate their plight? One useful step would be to lobby to eliminate the corporate income tax.
That might sound like a giveaway to the rich. It's not. The rich, including Boeing's stockholders, can take their companies and run -- and not just from Washington State to, say, North Carolina. To avoid our federal corporate tax, they can, and often do, move their operations and jobs abroad. Apple's tax return says it all: The company, according to one calculation, paid only 8.2 percent of its worldwide profits in United States corporate income taxes, thanks to piling up most of its profits and locating far too many of its operations overseas.
I, like many economists, suspect that our corporate income tax is economically self-defeating -- hurting workers, not capitalists, and collecting precious little revenue to boot.
The United States may well have the highest effective marginal corporate income tax rate of any developed country. Jack Mintz, a public finance economist and director of the School of Public Policy at the University of Calgary, puts the rate close to 35 percent, which is also the statutory rate. Other economists, using different techniques, calculate the marginal rate to be as low as 23 percent. But both figures are miles above zero.
They are also miles above our 13 percent average corporate income tax rate -- the ratio of corporate taxes to total corporate profits. The fact that the marginal tax rate, whether 23 percent, 35 percent or somewhere in between, is so much larger than the average rate suggests that a sizable share of corporate profits and production is ending up overseas and untaxed.
Making, rather than just stating, this case requires constructing a large-scale computer simulation model of the United States economy as it interacts over time with other nations' economies, and then seeing how the model reacts when you change the American corporate income tax. I've developed such a model with three colleagues through the Tax Analysis Center, a nonpartisan research group. Our findings make a very strong, worker-based case for corporate tax reform.
In the model, eliminating the United States' corporate income tax produces rapid and dramatic increases in American investment, output and real wages, making the tax cut self-financing to a significant extent. Somewhat smaller gains arise from revenue-neutral corporate tax base broadening, specifically cutting the corporate tax rate to 9 percent and eliminating all corporate tax loopholes. Both policies generate welfare gains for all generations in the United States, but particularly for young and future workers. Moreover, all Americans can benefit, though by less, if foreign countries also cut their corporate tax rates.
The size of the potential economic and welfare gains are stunningly large and don't reflect any extreme supply-side (a k a, voodoo economics) assumptions. Fully eliminating the corporate income tax and replacing any loss in revenues with somewhat higher personal income tax rates leads to a huge short-run inflow of capital, raising the United States' capital stock (machines and buildings) by 23 percent, output by 8 percent and the real wages of unskilled and skilled workers by 12 percent. Lowering the corporate rate tax to 9 percent while also closing loopholes is roughly revenue neutral and also produces very rapid increases in capital (by 17 percent), output (by 6 percent) and real wages (by 8 percent).
Eliminating the corporate tax and raising income tax rates or lowering the corporate tax rate and eliminating its loopholes are not the only options. Elsewhere, I have proposed eliminating the corporate income tax, but making shareholders pay income taxes on their companies' profits as they accrue. This leaves companies with no tax reason to avoid operating in the United States but ensures that shareholders, not wage earners, make up for any revenue losses through higher personal tax payments.
It's been a long time since the typical American worker received a raise in her real pay. In fact, average weekly earnings, exclusive of fringe benefits but adjusted for inflation, are 10 percent lower today than they were in 1966. This is America's nightmare, not its dream. Turning things around requires getting a lot of things right, starting, I'd argue, with corporate tax reform.

Full text:   PHILADELPHIA -- Academic heavyweights have been debating whether the current United States economy is so sluggish because of too much government stimulus or not enough, or because slower growth had become the norm even before the recession.
But maybe these arguments share a faulty premise.
The American economy is actually doing reasonably well -- at least compared with what would be expected after a major financial crisis -- according to a provocative study from Carmen M. Reinhart and Kenneth S. Rogoff, Harvard economists and financial crisis historians whose work has been attacked and embraced by the political right and left.
The study, presented over the weekend at the annual meetings of the American Economic Association, rejects comparisons with regular postwar American recoveries, as other economists have made, and instead examines 100 major, or "systemic," financial crises that have occurred over the last two centuries, in the United States and abroad.
It found that relative to previous American financial crises, the current economy is doing substantially better. Across nine major financial crises in the United States, the average peak-to-trough decline in inflation-adjusted per-capita gross domestic product is about 9 percent, and it has taken an average of 6.7 years to recover to the precrisis peak. During the years after crises, five of the nine episodes also had a "double-dip" downturn.
By contrast, the recent American subprime crisis beginning in 2007 had "only" a 5 percent drop in per capita output, and took "only" six years to get back to the precrisis peak. And so far, at least, there has been no second downward turn.
Employment and other measurements currently remain well below their precrisis peaks, but it is difficult to compare those numbers to past crises because the historical data for those categories is not as reliable, Ms. Reinhart said. Relative to its current peer countries, the study says, the United States is also doing unusually well.
Eleven other countries experienced systemic crises around the time the United States did: France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Ukraine and Britain. Six years later, just two of them -- the United States and Germany -- have recovered to their previous peak in real income.
While the United States has been doing well relative to historical crises, the other advanced countries seem to be doing especially poorly compared with their performance after previous crises.
"This crisis may in the end surpass in severity the Great Depression in a large number of countries," Ms. Reinhart said in an interview. "In fact, it may very well have one of the most protracted and painful recoveries for advanced countries in the aggregate."
Historical data shows that it takes about 7.4 years for the average advanced country that experienced a major crisis to reach its prior peak in real per-capita income; with nearly seven years gone by since the 2007 crisis began, many advanced countries still appear to be contracting.
Ms. Reinhart offered a few explanations for why the study showed the United States doing unusually well compared with both its past self and its current peers, however bad it still feels to the typical American worker. Among the biggest likely contributors are the major monetary and fiscal stimulus measures American policy makers undertook early in the crisis, which helped limit losses from the recession.
The United States also had some effective restructuring of debt through foreclosures. In some states, when the house is seized, borrowers do not usually still owe the balance of the loan. In much of Europe, Ms. Reinhart said, "You lose your house, but not the debt."
Finally, and perhaps most significant, the United States was still able to borrow money easily as the rest of the world sought safe assets. These enthusiastic lenders allowed American politicians to avoid the truly crippling austerity measures that countries like Greece resorted to in order to try to pay their bills.
"Why would any politician in their right mind undertake the kinds of austerity measures Greece has done? Because no one will lend to them, and existing creditors want full repayment," Ms. Reinhart said. "When the rest of the world is unwilling to lend, you do things that are driven by necessity."
Ms. Reinhart said one of the policy implications of the new study was that Europe needed to engage in substantially more restructuring, both of public and private debt.
While an earlier, much debated paper that she wrote with Mr. Rogoff about the correlation between high debt and lower growth was cited by congressional Republicans to justify austerity measures, she said her work over all had instead emphasized debt restructuring as a useful policy response.
"If you're going to engage in austerity, your best shot is if you at least couple it with something else, like debt write-offs, or inflation," she said. "But they're all ugly scenarios, really."
Asked about the debate on whether some underlying "secular stagnation" might have also predated the subprime crisis, as Lawrence H. Summers, her Harvard colleague and a former Obama administration official, has been arguing, she said it was too soon to tell. But she said the long-term decline in labor force participation was worrisome.
In a talk at the weekend conference, Mr. Summers reiterated his concerns about slow growth that in his view began before the crisis and that he had previously discussed in a speech in November at the International Monetary Fund.
These doldrums, he said on Saturday, stem from factors including slower population growth, a possible decline in technology innovation and changes in the distribution of income -- not only between the rich and poor but also between corporations and households.
With interest rates already so low, he said, it is difficult to use expansionary monetary policy to encourage investment. Instead, he called for government spending, particularly on infrastructure, especially while government borrowing costs are so cheap.
"The central imperative is anti-austerity, not austerity," he said, "and it has the potential to be as free a lunch as economics will ever find."
If Mr. Summers's theory is accurate, said John B. Taylor, a Stanford economist who served in Republican presidential administrations, "You would have expected the economy to not have been working so well before the crisis. He says it wasn't. I say it was."
Mr. Taylor said that such measures as inflation, housing investment and unemployment showed a strong economy leading up to the crisis.
Unlike the Reinhart-Rogoff work, Mr. Taylor argues that it is fair to compare some postwar recoveries to the current one -- a comparison that does indeed make today's economic conditions look unusually bad.
He places blame for this tepid recovery on economic uncertainty and regulation, and on what he calls a departure from rules-based, predictable monetary policy.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- IN November, housing starts were up 23 percent, and there was cheering all around. But the crowd would quiet down if it realized that another housing bubble had begun to grow.
Almost everyone understands that the 2007-8 financial crisis was precipitated by the collapse of a huge housing bubble. The Obama administration's remedy of choice was the Dodd-Frank Act. It is the most restrictive financial regulation since the Great Depression -- but it won't prevent another housing bubble.
Housing bubbles are measured by comparing current prices to a reliable index of housing prices. Fortunately, we have one. The United States Bureau of Labor Statistics has been keeping track of the costs of renting a residence since at least 1983; its index shows a steady rise of about 3 percent a year over this 30-year period. This is as it should be; other things being equal, rentals should track the inflation rate. Home prices should do the same. If prices rise much above the rental rate, families theoretically would begin to rent, not buy.
Housing bubbles, then, become visible -- and can legitimately be called bubbles -- when housing prices diverge significantly from rents.
In 1997, housing prices began to diverge substantially from rental costs. Between 1997 and 2002, the average compound rate of growth in housing prices was 6 percent, exceeding the average compound growth rate in rentals of 3.34 percent. This, incidentally, contradicts the widely held idea that the last housing bubble was caused by the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. Between 1997 and 2000, the Fed raised interest rates, and they stayed relatively high until almost 2002 with no apparent effect on the bubble, which continued to maintain an average compound growth rate of 6 percent until 2007, when it collapsed.
Today, after the financial crisis, the recession and the slow recovery, the bubble is beginning to grow again. Between 2011 and the third quarter of 2013, housing prices grew by 5.83 percent, again exceeding the increase in rental costs, which was 2 percent.
Many commentators will attribute this phenomenon to the Fed's low interest rates. Maybe so; maybe not. Recall that the Fed's monetary policy was blamed for the earlier bubble's growth between 1997 and 2002, even though the Fed raised interest rates during most of that period.
Both this bubble and the last one were caused by the government's housing policies, which made it possible for many people to purchase homes with very little or no money down. In 1992, Congress adopted what were called "affordable housing" goals for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which are huge government-backed firms that buy mortgages from banks and other lenders. Then, as now, they were the dominant players in the residential mortgage markets. The goals required Fannie and Freddie to buy an increasing quota of mortgages made to borrowers who were at or below the median income where they lived.
Through the 1990s and into the 2000s, the Department of Housing and Urban Development raised the quotas seven times, so that in the 2000s more than 50 percent of all the mortgages Fannie and Freddie acquired had to be made to home buyers who were at or below the median income. To make mortgages affordable for low-income borrowers, Fannie and Freddie reduced the down payments on mortgages they would acquire. By 1994, Fannie was accepting down payments of 3 percent and, by 2000, mortgages with zero-down payments. Although these lenient standards were intended to help low-income and minority borrowers, they couldn't be confined to those buyers. Even buyers who could afford down payments of 10 to 20 percent were attracted to mortgages with 3 percent or zero down. By 2006, the National Association of Realtors reported that 45 percent of first-time buyers put down no money. The leverage in that case is infinite.
This drove up housing prices. Buying a home became preferable to renting. A low or nonexistent down payment meant that families could borrow more and still remain within the monthly payment they could afford, especially if it was accompanied -- as it often was -- by an interest-only loan or a 30-year loan that amortized slowly. In effect, then, borrowing was constrained only by appraisals, which were ratcheted upward by the exclusive use of comparables in setting housing values.
Today, the same forces are operating. The Federal Housing Administration is requiring down payments of just 3.5 percent. Fannie and Freddie are requiring a mere 5 percent. According to the American Enterprise Institute's National Mortgage Risk Index data set for Oct. 2013, about half of those getting mortgages to buy homes -- not to refinance -- put 5 percent or less down. When anyone suggests that down payments should be raised to the once traditional 10 or 20 percent, the outcry in Congress and from brokers and homebuilders is deafening. They claim that people will not be able to buy homes. What they really mean is that people won't be able to buy expensive homes. When down payments were 10 to 20 percent before 1992, the homeownership rate was a steady 64 percent -- slightly below where it is today -- and the housing market was not frothy. People simply bought less expensive homes.
If we expect to prevent the next crisis, we have to prevent the next bubble, and we will never do that without eliminating leverage where it counts: among home buyers.

Full text:   FORMER SENATOR ALAN SIMPSON likes to say that if you can't learn to compromise on issues without compromising yourself, you should not be in Congress, be in business or get married. It is amazing how many people violate that rule, but especially in Congress and especially among the Tea Party types, where calling someone a "deal maker" is now the ultimate put down. What makes it crazier is that in American education, innovation and commerce today, "collaboration" is being taught and rewarded as the best way to do anything big, important and complex. Indeed, in Silicon Valley, a "collaborator" means someone with whom you're building something great. In D.C., it means someone committing political treason by working with the other party. And that is why Silicon Valley is now the turbo-engine of our economy and D.C. is the dead hand.
To be sure, in politics compromise is not a virtue in and of itself. There are questions of true principle -- civil rights, for instance -- where compromise might kill the principled choice. But there has been an inflation of "principles" lately that is inhibiting compromise. A certain tax rate or retirement age is not a principle. It's an interest that needs to be balanced against others. Today, we would be best served in meeting our biggest challenges by adopting a hybrid of the best ideas of left and right -- and the fact that we can't is sapping our strength.
For instance, on the debt/spending issue, Congress should be borrowing money at these unusually low rates to invest in a 10-year upgrade of our crumbling infrastructure (roads, bridges, telecom, ports, airports and rail lines) and in a huge funding increase for our national laboratories, research universities and institutes of health, which are the gardens for so many start-ups. Together, such an investment would stimulate sustained employment, innovation and the wealth creation to pay for it.
But this near-term investment should be paired with long-term entitlement reductions, defense cuts and tax reform that would be phased in gradually as the economy improves, so we do not add to the already heavy fiscal burden on our children, deprive them of future investment resources or leave our economy vulnerable to unforeseen shocks, future recessions or the stresses that are sure to come when all the baby boomers retire. President Obama has favored such a hybrid, but it was shot down by the Tea Party wing, before we could see if he could really sell it to his base.
We should exploit our new natural gas bounty, but only by pairing it with the highest environmental extraction rules and a national, steadily rising, renewable energy portfolio standard that would ensure that natural gas replaces coal -- not solar, wind or other renewables. That way shale gas becomes a bridge to a cleaner energy future, not just an addiction to a less dirty, climate-destabilizing fossil fuel.
In some cities, teachers' unions really are holding up education reform. But we need to stop blaming teachers alone. We also have a parent problem: parents who do not take an interest in their children's schooling or set high standards. And we have a student problem: students who do not understand the connection between their skills and their life opportunities and are unwilling to work to today's global standards. Reform requires a hybrid of both teacher reform and a sustained -- not just one speech -- national campaign to challenge parents and create a culture of respect and excitement for learning. Obama has failed to use his unique bully pulpit to lead such a campaign.
Finally, the merger of globalization and the information-technology revolution has shrunk the basis of the old middle class -- the high-wage, middle-skilled job. Increasingly, there are only high-wage, high-skilled jobs. This merger of globalization and I.T. has put capitalism -- and its core engine of creative destruction -- on steroids. That's why Republicans are wrong when they oppose raising minimum wages and expanding national health care. These kinds of social safety nets make the free market possible; otherwise people won't put up with creative destruction on steroids.
But it is capitalism, start-ups, risk-taking and entrepreneurship that make these safety nets affordable, which is why we need more tax incentives for start-ups, the substitutions of carbon taxes for payroll and corporate taxes, and more cuts to regulations that burden business. Unfortunately, promotion of risk-taking and risk-takers is disappearing from the Democratic Party agenda. Its energy and excitement is focused much more today on wealth redistribution than wealth creation. On immigration, Senate Democrats and Republicans forged a sensible hybrid solution, but Tea Partiers in the House are blocking it.
These hybrid solutions are not how to split the difference. They're how to make a difference. But they only get forged if Republican leaders take on the Tea Party -- which transformed the G.O.P. into a far-right party, uninterested in governing -- and remake the G.O.P. into a center-right party again. If that happened, I'm certain that a second-term Obama, who is much more center-left than the ridiculous G.O.P. caricatures, would meet them in the middle. Absent that, we're going to drift, unable to address effectively any of our biggest challenges or opportunities.

Help the Working Poor, but Share the Burden

Abstract: [...]those who are worried about inequality look for more immediate ways to help workers with limited skills. Because the earned-income tax credit has grown over time, the minimum wage is increasingly less relevant.\n

Full text:   In a speech last month, President Obama brought renewed attention to economic disparities in the United States. The gap between rich and poor is indeed substantial -- much larger than in most developed nations and much larger than it was 40 years ago. So what is the best way to help those struggling at the bottom of the economic ladder?
If we could figure out a way to do it, the most effective solution would be to increase the skills of those low-wage workers. Many studies have shown that the financial return of education is now high by historical standards. Reforming the education system so that more students graduate from high school and college is thus crucial to a more egalitarian prosperity. But upgrading the skills of the labor force is a decades-long project, not a quick fix. And educational reform is easier said than done.
As a result, those who are worried about inequality look for more immediate ways to help workers with limited skills. Before turning to President Obama's proposal, let's consider two other possibilities. For lack of better terms, call them Plan A and Plan B:
PLAN A The government subsidizes the incomes of low-wage workers. These subsidies are financed by increasing taxes on middle- and upper-income Americans.
PLAN B The government again subsidizes the incomes of low-wage workers. But under this plan, the subsidies are financed by taxing those companies that hire low-wage workers.
Stop reading for a moment and consider: Which of these plans would you prefer, and why? If you have a pen or pencil handy, jot down your reasons.
O.K. -- and now, here are my answers:
To me, Plan A is distinctly better than Plan B, which suffers from two problems -- one involving fairness, and one involving efficacy.
First, fairness: If we decide as a nation that we want to augment the income of low-wage workers, it seems only right that we all share that responsibility. Plan A does that. By contrast, Plan B concentrates the cost of the wage subsidy on a small subset of businesses and their customers. There is no good reason this group has a special obligation to help those in need.
Indeed, one might argue that this group is already doing more than its share. After all, it is providing jobs to the unskilled. Asking it to do even more, while letting everyone else off the hook, seems particularly churlish.
But even putting fairness aside, there is reason to doubt the efficacy of Plan B. Taxing businesses that hire unskilled workers would alter their behavior in ways that would hurt those we are trying to help.
To avoid the tax, businesses would have an incentive to hire fewer of these workers. For example, they would have greater incentive to replace workers with labor-saving machines.
In addition, some of the tax would be passed on to customers in the form of higher prices. These customers, in turn, would have an incentive to spend more of their income elsewhere. Over time, these businesses would shrink, reducing the job opportunities for the unskilled.
All in all, the Plan B tax-and-subsidy plan sounds like a pretty bad idea. Why, you might wonder, did I bring it up? Because it is the one favored by President Obama. He calls it an increase in the minimum wage.
To be sure, the minimum wage isn't exactly a system of taxes and subsidies. But its effects are much the same as those of Plan B. Unskilled workers earn more, and the businesses that hire them pay more. The main difference between the minimum wage and Plan B is that, under a minimum wage, the extra compensation is paid directly from the business to the worker, rather than indirectly via the government.
When proposing to increase the minimum wage, President Obama said that "there's no solid evidence that a higher minimum wage costs jobs." In fact, many studies suggest that it does precisely that. Mr. Obama is like a physician who prescribes a medicine based on a few studies that find no side effects while ignoring others that report debilitating effects.
What is most disappointing about the president's proposal is that the federal government has the option of using the much better Plan A. It is called the earned-income tax credit. Originally passed into law in 1975 and expanded substantially in the 1990s, the credit is a subsidy to low-wage workers paid by the rest of us, not just by the businesses who hire those workers.
Advocates of a higher minimum wage like to note that the current minimum wage, adjusted for inflation, is low by historical standards. That is true but beside the point. Because the earned-income tax credit has grown over time, the minimum wage is increasingly less relevant. As a nation we have switched from Plan B to the better Plan A. And a good case can be made for eliminating Plan B entirely by repealing the minimum wage.
Because "tax" is a dirty word in Washington, politicians generally prefer regulations like the minimum wage to accomplish their goals. But many regulations work like hidden taxes. Sometimes, in the process of hiding taxes, lawmakers opt for more damaging alternatives.
If, as a nation, we decide we want to do more to supplement the incomes of low-wage workers, that's fine. But let's do it openly, without artifice, and with broad participation.

Full text:   FIVE years ago, it would have been easy to predict that the stock market would be higher today than it was then. But no one would have paid attention. Stocks were in a free fall and wouldn't hit bottom for two more months.
Today, after a year in which the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose almost 30 percent, there are plenty of views on what the next five years might look like, but they're not in agreement. Plenty of people question whether the next five years can be as good as the last five. They base their concern on stock indexes setting records, while other parts of the economy, like jobs, continue to lag. On Friday, the S.&P. 500 closed at 1,831.37.
Other people see the fundamentals of United States companies as so solid that stocks will continue to do well despite their large run-up. "I think we're in for a long bull market and economic expansion that will be a little longer than average," said Marty Sass, chairman and chief executive of M. D. Sass, which manages $6 billion. "That's my best guess."
When you're looking out three to five years, guessing would seem to be part of it. While the one-year predictions I wrote about last week can be thrown off by an unexpected event or two, the medium-term view should be based on economic and corporate fundamentals, whether the prevailing mood is as dire as it was in 2009 or as cautiously optimistic as it is today.
This is where my interest in the three- to five-year investment outlook comes in. Back in 2009, the economy could have continued getting worse for longer than it did, but it would have turned around at some point. Today, some investors have the opposite concern, that the good times have run too long and there is a correction coming.
Regardless of whether a correction comes or not, this is where the medium-term projection should have value. Instead of reading tea leaves, it should be able to assess tectonic shifts. So now that we're in 2014, I wanted to consider what investment strategists think the near future could bring.
TRENDS Some of their views are very broad -- like stocks continuing to do well because of solid corporate earnings, low inflation and little pressure to raise wages given how high unemployment remains. But other views are based on stories that could play out for far longer than five years.
Production of oil and gas in the United States, for one, is expected to be stronger in five years. This is based on proven reserves and new drilling techniques. Saying what will happen in six to 12 months in this industry, though, is always difficult: A pipeline could explode, turmoil in the Middle East could impact prices, or regulation in Washington could cost companies more money. Longer term, the issue is supply and demand.
"We've discovered through this shale drilling how to exploit much more natural gas than we ever thought we could," said Kent Croft, chief investment officer of Croft Leominster. "Have all the stocks been the greatest this year? No. Do I expect them to outperform over time? I certainly do. I think this is one of those watershed moments in the U.S. economic outlook."
The mobile technology sector is another longer-term play. Mr. Sass said payment processors like PayPal were set to increase their processing of payments online but also to reach more into retail stores. And, of course, more of everything is moving to mobile devices, and companies are going to look to profit from that.
In other industries, like airlines and television broadcasting, consolidation is going to make stronger companies over the medium term. "These are industries that have gone from horror shows to very compelling plays," Mr. Sass said.
RISKS There are plenty of risks to the medium-term view. Kate Moore, United States chief investment strategist for J. P. Morgan Private Bank, said her clients generally had concerns about three big themes.
They worry first, she said, about how much higher equity prices can go. After four and a half years of prices going higher, they ask her when the rally is going to end. "This is where we'll walk them through corporate fundamentals and show them balance sheets and how margins can be sustainable," she said. "We find that most valuations are below 10- to 15-year historical norms."
The two other worries are what will happen to China and Europe. With China, she said, the concern is that the country's economic growth is going to slow and drag down the global economy. "There are some areas of the market, particularly in the resource space, that have overcapacity," she said.
Michael Tiedemann, chief investment officer of Tiedemann Wealth Management, said he saw China as one of the two big questions over the next three to five years.
(The other was how tighter rules on bank lending and the Federal Reserve's gradual end to buying bonds will play out.) He is not confident that China will be able to handle its transition from an export-based economy to a more balanced one smoothly.
"We're not predicting it's going to go badly, but along the way perhaps there will be conflicting signals," he said. And that calls for investors to be prepared for some volatility.
The questions about Europe revolved around whether the Continent had gotten over its problems. "They're either convinced that Europe is going to grow strongly next year because they've seen an appreciation of assets," Ms. Moore said. "Or they're very skeptical about institutional change and the capability to bring together so many different countries for cohesive change." (Her view is some place in the middle, she said.)
But Dean Tenerelli, European stock fund manager at T. Rowe Price, said that Europe's continued recovery was linked to what happened in China, which for years was bolstering companies around the world with its demands for goods.
"I come across a lot of businesses where they're disappointing because that froth isn't there anymore," he said. "The mining companies are cutting capital expenditures by 25 percent and that trickles through to all the companies that make that stuff and to the banks that were financing all of that. I even picked it up at beverage companies that have missed their numbers because the Chinese demand for cognac is declining."
THE VALUE Is looking out even five years still too short for long-term investors? Surely, oil drilling is going to be happening in North Dakota for a decade or more.
Keith Banks, president of U.S. Trust, said looking out 10 years was too long for most clients to think about, but five years was a great time frame to spot what he called the mega-trends where people made substantial wealth. These trends run over many years and offer a sustained opportunity for people to participate, even if they miss the very start of the trend.
"The world isn't an on/off switch," Mr. Banks said. "It is a dimmer switch."
He said his firm talked to clients more and more about the three- to five-year outlook, but often they needed the view over the next year to get to the longer one. "It's an iterative process," he said.
One of the main benefits of the longer view is it smooths out the noise that can crop up in just one year. "I have more confidence in looking ahead five years than I do one year," said Katie Nixon, chief investment officer at Northern Trust Wealth Management. "And I think most strategists feel the same. The short term is so uncertain and can be impacted by a lot of noise, while in the long term, markets are very fundamental."
How those projections are done, though, naturally relies on assumptions, and that means they can be flawed.
"Any three- to five-year forecast typically relies pretty heavily on some mean reversion assumptions -- I believe this company is relatively undervalued versus the market or its peers," Mr. Tiedemann said. "We have five-year forward views on asset classes and projections. At the core of those is our five-year expectation of G.D.P. growth, inflation and where we believe the 10-year Treasury yield will be at the end of five years."
In other words, the medium term may be more accurate, but projecting it is still difficult. Yet it is such a stabilizing view that can help people through the anxious moments of any year. "Our advice is, 'Don't time, don't chase and don't react,' " said Karl Wellner, president and chief executive of Papamarkou Wellner Asset Management. "We want our clients to think and plan ahead. It's very simple. But people kick themselves for making the same mistakes over and over."
There are worse New Year's resolutions.

Full text:   After last year's big party in the stock market, 2014 is starting off with a nagging hangover.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell a fraction of a point lower on Friday, beginning the year with a two-day losing streak for the first time since 2005.
Few analysts expect 2014 to produce gains comparable to last year's advance of nearly 30 percent, but many see a moderate increase as the economy continues to improve and investors move funds out of bonds and into stocks, which are generating much bigger returns for investors.
"The market is trying to find some direction here," said Scott Wren, a senior equity strategist at Wells Fargo Advisors. "We're in for a few days of trying to figure out whether we inch a little higher or see some down days."
The S.&P. 500-stock index fell 0.61 points, or 0.03 percent, to 1,831.37 and was 0.5 percent lower for the week.
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 28.64 points, or 0.2 percent, to 16,469.99. The Nasdaq composite fell 11.16 points, or 0.3 percent, to 4,131.91.
General Motors was among the stocks that posted the biggest losses in the S.&P. 500. The automaker fell $1.38, or 3.4 percent, to $39.57, after reporting a sales slump in the United States of more than 6 percent in December.
Energy companies have also started the year with declines as the price of oil falls.
On Friday, oil extended a weeklong skid by falling $1.48, or 1.6 percent, to $93.96 a barrel as signs emerged of ample supply worldwide.
Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, on Friday predicted stronger growth in 2014 and said that factors that had kept the economy from accelerating appeared to be abating.
"The combination of financial healing, greater balance in the housing market, less fiscal restraint, and, of course, continued monetary accommodation bodes well for U.S. economic growth in coming quarters," Mr. Bernanke said in comments to the annual meeting of the American Economic Association in Philadelphia.
The encouraging economic backdrop is a reason for investors to remain positive about stocks, despite the slow start to the year, said Bill Barker, a senior portfolio analyst at Motley Fool Funds, which manages about $600 million in stock mutual funds. "As long as there is no inflation and a good economy, with low interest rates," Mr. Barker said, "that's the kind of thing that stocks love."
Trading was muted on Friday after a winter storm hit the Northeast, and was quiet all week because of the New Year's Day holiday on Wednesday.
In bond trading, the price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 1/32 to 97 29/32, and its yield rose to 3 percent from 2.99 percent late Thursday.
The yield on the note climbed from 1.76 percent last year to as high as 3 percent as investors sold bonds in an improving economy. Many analysts expect the yield to continue rising this year as the Federal Reserve reduces, or "tapers," its stimulus.
"Depending on how quickly the Fed decides to taper, this could be a very bearish year for bonds," said Anna Rathbun, director of research at CBIZ, an investment and retirement consultant.

Abstract: In the many years I've been surveying experts for their predictions for the coming year, I cannot recall another time when optimism about the stock market, the economy and corporate profits was so widespread. In similar periods with low inflation, market multiples have ranged from 18 to 20 times projected earnings, Ms. Cohen said, compared to the market's current valuation of about 15 times earnings.

Full text:   After a banner year for stocks and a rocky one for bonds, market forecasters are remarkably consistent in their forecasts for 2014: more of the same.
Most forecasters are warning stock investors not to expect another year of 30 percent gains, as there was in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index in 2013. (The average forecast is for a 6 percent rise in the S.&P. 500, according to Bloomberg.) But the two analysts I selected for this column -- Abby Joseph Cohen of Goldman Sachs and Bill Miller of Legg Mason, both of whom were remarkably accurate about 2013 -- said another year of strong double-digit gains would not shock them. "We could easily see gains of more than 20 percent" in stocks, Mr. Miller told me. "And the market wouldn't be overpriced at that level."
In the many years I've been surveying experts for their predictions for the coming year, I cannot recall another time when optimism about the stock market, the economy and corporate profits was so widespread.
As is pessimism about the bond market.
The stock market's relentless rise this year seems to have tamed all but a few perma-bears. When the Federal Reserve said in September that the economy was too weak for the central bank to taper its purchases of securities, stocks went up. And when the Fed said in December that it would begin to taper -- stocks still went up.
The only thing that seemed to stop stocks' inexorable rise was Congress's self-destructive gridlock, and even that didn't last long.
Still, such unanimity may be the most worrisome portent for 2014. As Karl Case, emeritus professor of economics at Wellesley College and a co-founder of the S.&P./Case-Shiller index of housing prices, put it, "When everyone expects something to happen, that's when it doesn't." But neither he nor anyone else I consulted this year was willing to break ranks with the consensus.
"It gives me pause," Ms. Cohen, senior investment strategist for Goldman Sachs and president of the Global Markets Institute, said, referring to the bullish herd mentality that has gripped Wall Street. "But there's no reason to be a contrarian just for the sake of being contrarian. I look at the fundamentals. Even after such a strong year in 2013, I think it will continue."
Ms. Cohen was almost exactly right a year ago, when she predicted the S.&P. 500 would end 2013 at 1,787. (It closed at 1,848.) At the time, her forecast seemed wildly bullish, especially since stocks were at near record levels, and had registered gains four years running. "There was a significant mispricing of assets a year ago," she said, referring to both stock prices (too low) and bonds (inflated).
That's not as obvious now that stocks have gained. "There's something artificial about current asset prices, which have been largely driven by liquidity," she said. "But we've begun a transition to valuations that are driven by fundamentals." And those, she said, are strong. She cited an expanding United States economy, higher job creation, gains in labor productivity, lower energy prices and subdued inflation. "This will provide staying power," she said.
Goldman Sachs's baseline forecast for the S.&P. 500 at the end of 2014 is 1,900, or a modest 3 percent gain. But that assumes no expansion in the market's price-to-earnings ratio. In similar periods with low inflation, market multiples have ranged from 18 to 20 times projected earnings, Ms. Cohen said, compared to the market's current valuation of about 15 times earnings. If that multiple expands to 19, the S.&P. 500 would rise to about 2,200, according to the Goldman Sachs model. That would produce a 19 percent rise in the S.&P. 500.
Mr. Miller, who runs the Legg Mason Opportunity Trust, returns to this column for the third consecutive year. He was also accurate in his forecast for 2013, and as a mutual fund manager, he put his money behind his forecast: His fund rose a remarkable 67 percent in 2013 on the heels of a 40 percent gain in 2012, helping him regain his sterling reputation for stock-picking, which was briefly tarnished by the financial crisis. (Before 2008, Mr. Miller's fund outperformed the S.&P. 500 for a record 15 consecutive years.)
Mr. Miller cited many of the same economic fundamentals as Ms. Cohen. At the same time, he saw little danger on the horizon. "Recession? An oil price spike? Sudden tightening by the Fed? I don't see any of that. The path of least resistance is for the market to go higher."
And he, too, wouldn't be surprised to see the market's price-to-earnings ratio expand, driving up prices. "Historically, in the late stages of a bull market, stocks reach very high multiples, in the range of 20 to 22," he said. While he doesn't set a numerical target for the S.&P. 500, he said he expected returns at least "in the low to midteens," and gains of more than 20 percent were possible. "There's really no catalyst for a down market," he said.
Mr. Miller's fund scored in 2013 by investing in Netflix, Best Buy, Delta Air Lines, E-Trade Financial and Genworth, which he considered wildly undervalued. "You won't find many of those in today's market," he said, although he's keeping an eye on J. C. Penney as a potential turnaround story. "With even a little good news it will jump 50 percent," he said.
This year, he likes the housing sector, financials, technology and airlines. Apple remains one of his fund's biggest holdings, and he still likes both Delta Air Lines and United Airlines, which should benefit from industry consolidation after the American-US Airways merger. "I think United could double in three years," he said, adding: "There's a dramatic industry turnaround in progress."
When Bill Gross, the highly regarded bond expert and a founder of the investment firm Pimco, predicted last year in this column that there would be "ashes in our stockings" for bond investors, he was right -- although Christmas came in May, when the bond market plunged on a mere hint from the Fed chairman Ben Bernanke that the central bank might begin tapering its purchases of securities sooner than expected.
A Bank of America index of the total returns on United States government bonds fell 3.2 percent for the year, the first annual decline since 2009. And while Mr. Gross's Pimco Total Return Fund did a little better, it still dropped nearly 2 percent -- its first annual loss since 1999. It also lost its title as the world's largest mutual fund.
Many sectors, like high-yield and municipal bonds, fared much worse.
Investors shouldn't expect anything much better in 2014, Mr. Gross said. "It's almost as obvious now as it was a year ago," he told me. "All bonds are still artificially priced, and that means artificially high. So the question becomes, 'Does that change anytime soon?' " He noted that the Fed had been very cautious and has pledged to keep rates low for the foreseeable future. So after May's sudden disruption, the rise in interest rates has been gradual. "I think the trend will continue in 2014," Mr. Gross said.
Still, he said: "Ultimately, if you've got artificial prices, at some point, those prices begin to head down like we saw in May. That was a wake-up call to mom-and-pop investors that bonds can go down. I think sitting on cash is O.K. It's hideous in concept. My money market fund yields 0.01 percent. You can do a little better in a short-term Treasury fund or exchange-traded fund. But we're down to slim pickings, as we say."
One reason for recent strength in the economy -- and resulting pressure on interest rates -- is the continuing rebound in real estate, which rose a better-than-expected annualized rate of 13.6 percent through October, according to the latest S.&P./Case-Shiller 20-city home price index. That came as no surprise to Professor Case, who told me last year that it was a terrific time to buy real estate and accurately called the bottom of the real estate slump in this column the year before.
"The fundamentals are there to support a pretty good run-up," he said at the time. "But the pace of gains is slowing down. People are getting more cautious. Apart from a few pockets, you're not going to see annualized double-digit gains in housing prices. That's completely irrational." Interest rates remain a wild card. "Everyone thinks they're going higher, but who's to say?" he said. He noted that current 30-year fixed rates of about 4.5 percent were low by historical standards. "So over all, I'm cautiously optimistic, but there are a lot of minefields," he said.

Abstract: (Holland Cotter) Brooklyn Museum: 'Wangechi Mutu: A Fantastic Journey' (through March 9) For the past decade and a half, Wangechi Mutu, born in Kenya and based in New York, has been producing large-scale figurative collages as politically nuanced as they are ravishing. Since she first started to show them in the late 1990s, they have grown more complex and detailed, and we're seeing them at what has to be some kind of peak moment in this pithy traveling survey. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org.

Museums
Bronx Museum of the Arts: 'Tony Feher' (through Feb. 16) Almost anything can be beautiful if it's presented in the right way. That's where the sculptor Tony Feher comes in. His palette consists almost entirely of cheap manufactured objects, including glass and plastic bottles; metal and plastic bottle tops; marbles, coins, nuts and bolts, metal rings, plastic bags, broken pieces of glass, rope, plastic cord, shredded paper, cans and cardboard boxes. He organizes these and other things into simple but surprisingly exciting, often funny configurations with intriguing philosophical implications. This beautiful show surveys a 25-year career. 1040 Grand Concourse, at 165th Street, Morrisania, (718) 681-6000, bronxmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson)
Brooklyn Museum: 'Behind Closed Doors: Art in the Spanish American Home, 1492-1898' (through Jan. 12) As its voyeuristic title suggests, the show follows the layout of a typical house belonging to an elite member of New World society. Drawn largely from the museum's sizable collection of Spanish colonial art, it overflows with sumptuous textiles, family portraits bearing coats of arms, fine silver and porcelain and gilded everything -- and leaves you in the strange position of marveling at the opulence of domestic life in the Spanish colonies while pondering some of the ugliest social repercussions of colonialism. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Karen Rosenberg)
Brooklyn Museum: 'Divine Felines: Cats of Ancient Egypt' (through December 2014) If your dream of heaven is eternity spent with the pets you love, this show is for you. All of its 30 objects, sifted from the museum's renowned Egyptian collection, are of cats, big and little, feral and tame, celestial and not. Whether cast in bronze or carved in stone, their forms and personalities were meant to outlast time, and so they have. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter)
Brooklyn Museum: 'Wangechi Mutu: A Fantastic Journey' (through March 9) For the past decade and a half, Wangechi Mutu, born in Kenya and based in New York, has been producing large-scale figurative collages as politically nuanced as they are ravishing. Since she first started to show them in the late 1990s, they have grown more complex and detailed, and we're seeing them at what has to be some kind of peak moment in this pithy traveling survey. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Cotter)
Brooklyn Museum: 'War/Photography: Images of Armed Conflict and Its Aftermath' (through Feb. 2) This flawed but intensely absorbing exhibition presents pictures by more than 280 photographers relating to conflicts from the Mexican-American War of 1846-49 to the Arab Spring revolution of 2010-11. Photographs from widely different times and places are grouped according to themes like "Recruitment and Embarkation" and "Homecoming," suggesting that all wars are somehow similar, which is debatable. The main problem, though, is the claustrophobic, overly busy installation, which is unfortunate because there is hardly a single picture that doesn't cry out to be seen and pondered by itself. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Johnson)
Drawing Center: 'Drawing Time, Reading Time' and 'Dickinson/Walser: Pencil Sketches' (through Jan. 12) Works by nine artists in "Drawing Time, Reading Time" highlight by variously inventive means what letters, words, sentences, texts and books look like more or less apart from what they mean. Included are concrete poems typed by Carl Andre; a 451-page memoir handwritten by Sean Landers; and pencil-drawn copies of photocopies from books about conceptual art by Molly Springfield. The equally interesting "Dickinson/Walser: Pencil Sketches" presents original manuscripts of poems by Emily Dickinson and stories by the Swiss writer Robert Walser, both of whom wrote their first drafts in remarkably idiosyncratic ways. 35 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 219-2166, drawingcenter.org. (Johnson)
Frick Collection: 'Vermeer, Rembrandt, and Hals: Masterpieces of Dutch Painting From the Mauritshuis' (through Jan. 19) Johannes Vermeer's much-loved "Girl With a Pearl Earring," not seen in New York for nearly 30 years, is one of 15 choice pictures in this traveling show of loans from the Royal Picture Gallery Mauritshuis in The Hague. She's joined by four Rembrandts, Jacob van Ruisdael's out-of-this-world "View of Haarlem With Bleaching Grounds" and -- maybe the star among stars -- Carel Fabritius's palpitating little "Goldfinch." 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700, frick.org; admission is by timed tickets. (Cotter)
Guggenheim Museum: 'Christopher Wool' (through Jan. 22) This show, one of the most beautiful exhibitions to unwind up the Guggenheim's spiral ramp in some time, surveys the 25-year accomplishment of an "endgame" painter who brought the medium to the brink of extinction and then fruitfully worked his way back from the edge. It starts with his laconic, implacable black-and-white word paintings and then shows him layering various deadpan handmade and printed motifs, ending up with an innovative combination of visual transparency and pictorial force. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Roberta Smith)
International Center of Photography: 'Lewis Hine' and 'Future of America: Lewis Hine's New Deal Photographs' (through Jan. 19) These inspiring exhibitions survey the career of the pioneering documentary photographer Lewis Hine (1874-1940), whose subjects included immigrants just arriving at Ellis Island; children working in factories and coal mines; families living in Lower East Side tenements; black Americans; and men building skyscrapers. Hine was an inquiring, generously humane sociologist. He had a romantic belief in the possibilities of America, epitomized by his heroic images of construction workers near the top of the nearly complete Empire State Building. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Johnson)
Jewish Museum: 'Chagall: Love, War, and Exile' (through Feb. 2) This exhibition of Marc Chagall's work from the 1930s and '40s hinges on a group of paintings and drawings of Jesus on the cross, most of them made during, or shortly before or after, World War II. In these dark and anguished works, Chagall unexpectedly adopts Jesus as a Jewish martyr, as a symbol of a persecuted people and of the refugee artist in particular. The show's final gallery, however, glosses over this difficult period with some of Chagall's more romantic and nostalgic postwar paintings. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'The American West in Bronze, 1850-1925' (through April 13) This intriguing and spiritually troubling show presents 65 mostly pedestal-scale sculptures representing standard themes of the old American West: cowboys, Indians and wild animals. It includes famous practitioners of the genre like Frederic Remington and Charles M. Russell, as well as 26 others. Nearly all the sculptures are in a mode of three-dimensional illustrative realism and tend heavily to romantic idealization. There's the rub: The real history of the conquest of the West by white folks was much worse than what these artists imagined in their very popular works. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Balthus: Cats and Girls -- Paintings and Provocations' (through Jan. 12) This tightly focused show charts the first 25 years (1934-59) of this French artist's enigmatic paintings of nubile adolescents and girls, sometimes paired with cats that heighten the erotic undercurrent. He is best early, in the chiseled, psychologically complex portraits of Thérèse Blanchard from the late 1930s, and even earlier, in an astoundingly precocious suite of 40 small ink drawings about his beloved cat Mitsou. They were made when he was 11 and have never before been exhibited. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Brush Writing in the Arts of Japan' (through Jan. 12) This elegant collection-based show is the perfect place to mourn the lost art of handwriting. Here, among the medieval Zen monks, the 11th-century literati and the courtesans of the Edo-era "floating world," it's impossible to separate language from gesture and composition from performance. Objects on view are not limited to examples of calligraphy; they include Chinese-influenced ink paintings, decorative objects, large screens and woodblock prints. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Ink Art: Past as Present in Contemporary China' (through April 6) This museum's first survey of recent Chinese art uses the lens of the culture's ancient brush and ink tradition so basic to its landscape painting and calligraphy. It doesn't always work. The show endures a scattered installation, includes overly refined displays of empty skill and wanders off message in spots, especially with several sculptures that don't seem to belong here. But a few moments of visual life and many interesting questions about the weight of the old on the new make it worthwhile. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Jewels By JAR' (through March 9) Crowd-pleasers needn't represent lowered curatorial standards in terms of subject and execution, but this one does. It packs 400 efforts by the New York-born, Paris-based high-society jeweler, Joel Arthur Rosenthal (JAR), into a very dark gallery with insufficient labeling or historical backup. Large pave brooches, usually of flowers, abound; too many pieces date from 2010 or later. There are certainly redeeming works, but the show cries out for editing, scholarly support and better viewing conditions. Artist and audience are left hanging, with the museum's mercenary agenda in full view. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: William Kentridge: 'The Refusal of Time' (through May 11) Everything is on the move in this mini-theater-cum-power-plant of an installation. In wrap-around videos, metronomes pound. Clock-faces spin, spewing trails of stars. Drawings draw and erase themselves. Maps of Africa appear and disappear. White-coated figures mix potions amid giant watch springs. At the center of the gallery a wooden contraption pumps away like an energy source. A collaboration between Mr. Kentridge, who is based in South Africa, and Peter L. Galison, a science historian at Harvard, the piece refers to the European colonial experiment, which strove to shape other cultures to its own concepts of reality, only to find that those cultures had different, resistant, assertive realities of their own. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Silla: Korea's Golden Kingdom' (through Feb. 23) This intriguing show presents more than 130 objects from Silla, a kingdom that dominated the Korean Peninsula in the seventh and eighth centuries. The first two of three sections includes gold jewelry, formally austere pottery, glassware and other objects excavated from mound shaped, earth-covered tombs in the city of Gyeongju. The third section displays sculpture made after Buddhism was adopted as the state religion around 530. Among the most captivating is a beautiful three-foot-high, gilt bronze sculpture of a young Bodhisattva, which, like a number of other works in the show, has been designated a Korean National Treasure. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Venetian Glass by Carlo Scarpa: The Venini Company, 1932-1947' (through March 2) Before he turned to architecture, Carlo Scarpa (1906-78) designed glass vessels, achieving a lifetime's worth of beauty and innovation in a short, remarkable burst of creativity. His achievement is honored with this sublime exhibition of nearly 300 of his splendidly sculptural, radiantly colored, ingeniously patterned vessels. They have an inspiring wholeness: process, form and decoration become a single thing; art, craft and science merge. And content of the non-narrative, experiential kind abounds. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
MoMA PS1: 'Mike Kelley' (through Feb. 2) This retrospective of the Los Angeles artist Mike Kelley fills 40,000 feet of gallery space at PS1. And it's that very rare thing, a huge show that should be huge. Kelley earned this blowout; his work sustains one. In a three-decade career, cut off by his suicide, at 57, last year, he did it all genrewise: performance, painting, drawing, printmaking, sculpture, video, installation, sound art and writing. And he wove together -- twisted together -- all of that into what amounted to a single conceptual project based on recurrent themes: class politics, popular culture, black humor, anti-formalist rigor and a moral sense, unshakably skeptical, that ran through everything like a spine. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Cotter)
Morgan Library & Museum: 'Leonardo da Vinci: Treasures from the Biblioteca Reale, Turin' (through Feb. 2) A mere handful of drawings by Leonardo da Vinci are in this exquisite show. But in the case of the great multidisciplinary experimentalist and technician, even a little is a lot. Leonardo the scientist is here in the drawn and annotated "Codex on the Flight of Birds" and the artist in the exquisite silverpoint image called "Head of a Young Woman." Both works are in New York for the first time. The show is fleshed out with work by some of the master's followers and by the Morgan's own "Codex Huygens," a late-16th-century manuscript that has faithful copies of now-lost Leonardo drawings. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Cotter)
El Museo del Barrio: 'La Bienal 2013: Here Is Where We Jump' (through Feb. 15) Much of the work by the 37 artists in the seventh edition of El Museo's Bienal is budget-conscious in its materials and modest in size, scaled to small studios. Maybe exactly because of such restrictions, the show is thoughtful and personal, uneven in parts, solid as a whole. It's also a product of that old-fashioned thing, the ethnically specific museum. Even with definitions of ethnicity stretched all kinds of ways -- what does "Latino" really mean anymore, anyway? -- the issue of identity remains at the core of such institutions and informs much of the work in this show. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, (212) 831-7272, elmuseo.org. (Cotter)
Museum of Arts and Design: 'Out of Hand: Materializing the Postdigital' (through June 1) If you haven't quite wrapped your head around the concept of 3-D printing, or haven't yet had a digital scanner wrap itself around you, now you can do both in this survey of computer-assisted art, architecture and design. The show looks at art made since 2005 and fills nearly three floors, including many irresistible interactive projects. Its ideas may not be entirely new; the Museum of Modern Art's 2008 exhibition "Design and the Elastic Mind" covered much of the same territory, but there's something to be said for this more down-to-earth, production-focused exhibition. 2 Columbus Circle, (212) 299-7777, madmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
Museum of Modern Art: 'American Modern: Hopper to O'Keeffe' (through Jan. 26) An attempt to prove that the Museum of Modern Art did not neglect American art between the wars before the Abstract Expressionists arrived, this selection of 120 works in several mediums presents plenty to look at in a beautiful installation, but it is completely predictable in its choice of artists and its viewpoint. By making no effort to reimagine early American modernism, it is most notable as evidence of the Modern's current indifference to the field. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Designing Modern Women 1890-1990' (through Oct. 5) Shoehorned into half the museum's design department, this conversation-starting display of objects from MoMA's permanent collection features items designed by more than 60 women, many of whom worked with male partners. Some, like Marianne Brandt and Eileen Gray, are well known to design aficionados, but most will be unfamiliar to a general audience. Most objects were created for domestic consumption. The pièce de résistance is a kitchen designed by Charlotte Perriand for the apartments in Le Corbusier's Unité d'Habitation in Marseille, France. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Johnson)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Dorothea Rockburne: Drawing Which Makes Itself' (through Feb. 2) The main attraction in this mini-survey of Dorothea Rockburne is a group of works from her 1973 show at the Bykert Gallery in New York. There the artist developed a rigorously mathematical and strenuously physical method of drawing; she folded and scored large sheets of carbon paper as she moved them around the gallery, leaving a succession of marks -- lines and thumbprints -- on the wall and floor. They are a brain tease, especially if you try to follow the diagrams Ms. Rockburne has provided, but they also have a kind of poetry of movement; they make you think of professors scrawling equations on chalkboards. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Rosenberg)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Ileana Sonnabend: Ambassador for the New' (through April 21) Ileana Sonnabend, who died in 2007 at 92, was one of the most foresighted art dealers of the late 20th century. This modest-size exhibition, made up of work she either owned or showed in her gallery, gives a sense of the range of her interests, from Jasper Johns to Jeff Koons. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Cotter)
Museum of Modern Art: Isa Genzken: 'Retrospective' (through March 10) This prolific German sculptor -- for whom New York and its skyscrapers are a major source of inspiration -- receives her first comprehensive museum survey in this country. A grand, glamorous and sometimes grating 40-year overview, it traces her progress from idiosyncratic Minimalist monoliths to the distinctive, often architectonic, assemblages she began making in 1997 from cheesy materials and objects, concocting a raw, unapologetic beauty and a weirdly elliptical if literal-minded social commentary, often about the United States, power and war. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Magritte: The Mystery of the Ordinary, 1926-1938' (through Jan. 12) There's no mystery about why Magritte is popular. His illustrational mode reads loud and clear from across a room (a good thing, as MoMA's galleries are sure to be jammed). And he had some ideas. He was a sophisticated trickster, a bourgeois gentilhomme with a geek inside, hacking into everyday life and planting little weirdness bugs: legs sprouting from shirt collars, a choo-choo coming out of a chimney, words having lives of their own. We're unlikely ever to see him look better than he does in this show, which focuses on the single fresh and interesting decade in his long career. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Cotter)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Walker Evans: American Photographs' (through March 9) In 1938, the Museum of Modern Art mounted its first one-person photography exhibition: "American Photographs," by Walker Evans. This gripping, 75th-anniversary reprise of that show presents more than 50 images from that body of work. It is accompanied by a reissue of the original catalog, which includes a wonderfully insightful essay by Evans's friend and supporter Lincoln Kirstein. Together, the show and the book reverberate now in a time when the idea of America is subject to debates as fractious and far-reaching as at any time since the Civil War. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Johnson)
National Academy Museum: 'See It Loud: Seven Post-War American Painters' (through Jan. 26) This uneven museumwide show presents 80 paintings by seven representational artists who came of age during the ascendancy of Abstract Expressionism and shortly thereafter. Three make the show worth viewing. Paul Georges's outsized landscapes, nudes, self-portraits and allegorical narratives have a terrific painterly flair. Neil Welliver's big pictures of wilderness places in Maine project a galvanizing tension between brusquely applied paint and acutely observed topography. And Stanley Lewis's views of scruffy, residential backyards involve improbable amounts of built-up paint and intensely detailed realism. 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880, nationalacademy.org. (Johnson)
Neue Galerie: 'Vasily Kandinsky: From Blaue Reiter to the Bauhaus, 1910-1925' (through Feb. 10) The Neue Galerie's first show on Kandinsky centers on a rich 15-year period, also the purview of the Museum of Modern Art's recent "Inventing Abstraction, 1910-1925." During this time Kandinsky shifted from the prismatic Expressionism of Der Blaue Reiter into pure abstraction and from easel paintings into set designs and murals. A reconstruction of one of those mural projects is on view, as are abundantly decorative wall panels made for a private collector in New York. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Rosenberg)
New Museum: 'Chris Burden: Extreme Measures' (through Jan. 12) This superb survey rebalances the career of an artist best known for his incendiary early 1970s performance art. It gives his subsequent sculptures pride of place and emphasizes his consistent drive to show how things work, whether socially, psychologically or mechanically. Veering from startling found objects (a huge flywheel, a meteor) to obsessively hand-built bridges, the show is especially simpatico with the museum's cellblock décor. In fact, the place has never looked better. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side, (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Smith)
New-York Historical Society: 'The Armory Show at 100: Modern Art and Revolution' (through Feb. 23) The International Exhibition of Modern Art, otherwise known as the Armory Show, woke American art from its provincial slumbers a century ago. Was it a good thing or a bad thing, and is there any reason to care about it now? With more than 100 works from the original exhibition by American and European artists and a big, richly illuminating catalog, "The Armory Show at 100" offers an excellent opportunity to ponder such questions. 170 Central Park West, at 77th Street, (212) 873-3400, nyhistory.org. (Johnson)
Noguchi Museum: 'Isamu Noguchi and Qi Baishi: Beijing 1930' (through Jan. 26) Isamu Noguchi worked with the Chinese ink painter Qi Baishi for just six months and could speak to him only through a translator. But this brief, mostly nonverbal tutelage had a lasting impact on Noguchi's art, as we see in this elegant and persuasive exhibition of ink paintings by both artists. Qi helped Noguchi to escape the long shadow of an intense two-year apprenticeship to Brancusi and to develop a new style of abstraction: one that was improvisational, urbane and broadly Asian-inspired. 9-01 33rd Road, at Vernon Boulevard, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 204-7088, noguchi.org. (Rosenberg)
Queens Museum of Art: Peter Schumann 'The Shatterer' (through March 30) A recent expansion has doubled the size of the Queens Museum. Of five celebratory new shows, the largest and most moving is the solo museum debut of Peter Schumann, the founder and director of Bread and Puppet Theater, which is 50 years old this year. The show demonstrates how thoroughly Bread and Puppet is his creation. Its down-value look and activist ethos are evident in everything, including the black house-paint mural he has brushed, single-handedly, across one of the museum's wall and the hand-printed, hand-bound books he has placed in the gallery he designates as chapel and library. Every inch of this room is covered with figures and words: angels and ogres, exhortations and condemnations, art for one and for all, straight from the hand, right to the moral core. Flushing Meadows Corona Park, (718) 592-9700, queensmuseum.org. (Cotter)
Rubin Museum of Art: 'Allegory and Illusion: Early Portrait Photography From South Asia' (through Feb. 10) "Allegory and Illusion" is a fascinating little piece of a very complicated puzzle. Ostensibly a focused, regional exhibition, it has much to say about the larger relationship between photography and colonialism. Included are many different forms of early photography, representing an array of markets and social classes: grand portraits of Nepalese royals and palm-size cartes de visite for the masses, ethnographic albums by British photographers and hand-painted photographs from Indian portrait studios. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000, rmanyc.org. (Rosenberg)
Studio Museum in Harlem: 'The Shadows Took Shape' (through March 9) Space is definitely the place in this lively group exhibition devoted to Afrofuturism, a contemporary art trend that takes the ultra-free-jazz musician Sun Ra as its patron saint and locates itself in a universe where racial and ethnic identities float free from stereotypes without losing track of the histories that created them. William Villalongo sets African sculpture and modernist painting soaring together among the stars; the Kenyan artist Wanuri Kahiu films ecological cataclysm and renewal in ages to come; William Cordova, who lives in New York and Lima, Peru, recreates the Falcon spaceship from George Lucas's "Star Wars," now equipped with a cultural studies library. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org. (Cotter)
Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Rituals of Rented Island: Object Theater, Loft Performance, and the New Psychodrama -- Manhattan, 1970-1980' (through Feb. 2) Four decades ago, performance art was young, funky and clunky, beyond modernism, or maybe perversely beneath it, meant to reflect a world in which materials were transient, old models useless and values shifty. We get a vivid flashback to those beginnings in this show of photographs, videos and objects that breathes surprising life into archival matter and brings wonderful artists like Stuart Sherman, Jared Bark, Julia Heyward, Jill Kroesen and Ralston Farina back into view. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Cotter)
Whitney Museum of American Art: 'T. J. Wilcox: In the Air' (through Feb. 9) A Romantic miniaturist best known for short, poetic films pieced together from found and made footage goes big in a dazzling 360-degree, 30-minute, day-to-night-to-day view of Lower Manhattan. Six brief collagelike films pop onto the panorama one at a time, focusing on a specific event, person or experience, including Sept. 11. We see the city as a kaleidoscopic archive, alive with buildings, history, memories and people, and understand anew that the metropolis and the moving image were made for each other. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith)
Galleries: Uptown
'Rebirth: Recent Work by Mariko Mori' (through Jan. 12) In Mariko Mori's first New York solo museum show in a decade, the futuristic fashion plate of Ms. Mori's earlier photographs and videos -- the artist herself, in Manga-inspired get-ups -- seems to have vanished, and so has her contemporary Japanese landscape of malls, airports and business districts. In their place are meditative, abstract sculptures and installations, strongly influenced by Buddhism, theoretical physics and prehistoric cultures. They make up an ambitious but disappointing show, which summons big ideas and primal energies only to give them trite, New Agey forms. 333 East 47th Street, (212) 832-1155, japansociety.org. (Rosenberg)
Galleries: Chelsea
'Arman the Collector: The Artist's Collection of African Art' (through Jan. 11) This stunning show presents 21 African sculptures, mostly masks, collected by the artist known for accumulating many similar objects into absurdist sculptures. Paul Kasmin, 293 10th Avenue, at 27th Street, (212) 563-4474, paulkasmingallery.com. (Johnson)
Martina Bacigalupo: 'Gulu Real Art Studio' (through Feb. 8) In 2010 the Italian photojournalist Martina Bacigalupo spent time in the city of Gulu in northern Uganda, where she came across a curious form of portraiture. In a local shop called the Gulu Real Art Studio, she found dozens of full-length pictures of sitters from which the heads had been neatly cut out. The shop's owner, Obal Denis, explained why. His machine for developing passport-size photos automatically produced four prints at a time, but most people coming for an ID picture needed only one. So it was easier, and cheaper, to shoot a regular full-length portrait, edit out a head shot and toss what was left. The pictures in this remarkable show are the result: studies in body language and clothing, accompanied by audio-taped interviews made with some of the sitters. The Walther Collection Project Space, 508-526 West 26th Street, Suite 718, (212) 352-0683, walthercollection.com. (Cotter)
Thomas Demand: 'Dailies' (through Jan. 18) Thomas Demand's photographs are always a little bit uncanny, but the more modest, quotidian works in his latest exhibition are his weirdest yet. Their sources are Mr. Demand's own cellphone photographs, and their subjects are so unassuming as to seem disposable: a bar of soap on a bathtub ledge, a paper cup wedged into a chain-link fence. These objects are all paper sculptures, like the ones in his earlier works, but they've been rendered extraordinarily vivid by the dye-transfer printing method, which Mr. Demand is using for the first time. It's as if he's channeling William Eggleston. Matthew Marks Gallery, 526 West 22nd Street, (212) 243-0200, matthewmarks.com. (Rosenberg)
Cyprien Gaillard: 'Today Diggers, Tomorrow Dickens' (through Jan. 30) The familiar convention of giant, slightly altered, out-of-context ready-mades arrayed in a pristine gallery is reiterated by an artist best known for brutal videos that document the dehumanizing scale and effect of immense Eastern-bloc apartment complexes. Here he adds luxurious rods of yellow onyx to scarred excavation heads from earth-moving machines. Gladstone Gallery, 530 West 21st Street, (212) 206-7606, gladstonegallery.com. (Smith)
Roni Horn: 'Everything was sleeping as if the universe were a mistake' (through Jan. 11) Beautiful but vacuous, Roni Horn's exhibition teeters between high-minded art and high-end design. It's in three sections: two expansive spaces each are occupied by 10 squat, cylindrical objects of solid, cast glass, each the size of a TV room hassock. They are lovely luxury objects. Part three is a narrow gallery separating the glass installations and displaying large, puzzling abstract drawings that seemed designed to support Ms. Horn's conceptualist cred. Hauser & Wirth, 511 West 18th Street, (212) 790-3900, hauserwirth.com. (Johnson)
Galleries: Other
'Danish Paintings From the Golden Age to the Modern Breakthrough: Selections From the Collection of Ambassador John L. Loeb Jr.' (through Jan. 25) Paintings dating from the late 1700s to the early 20th century play out a fascinating dialogue between Scandinavian restraint and imported (i.e., French) freedom and sensuality. Sunny French Impressionism evidently made an mark on Danish artists, but in the show's most compelling works -- funereal pictures of women in gray rooms by Vilhelm Hammershoi -- desire and repression fought to an agonized stalemate. Scandinavia House, 58 Park Avenue, at 38th Street, (212) 779-3587, scandinaviahouse.org. (Johnson)
Simon Dinnerstein: 'The Fulbright Triptych' (continuing) This little-known masterpiece of 1970s realism was begun by the young Simon Dinnerstein during a Fulbright fellowship in Germany in 1971 and completed in his hometown, Brooklyn, three years later. Incorporating carefully rendered art postcards, children's drawings and personal memorabilia; a formidable worktable laid out with printmaking tools and outdoor views; and the artist and his family, it synthesizes portrait, still life, interior and landscape and rummages through visual culture while sampling a dazzling range of textures and representational styles. It should be seen by anyone interested in the history of recent art and its oversights. German Consulate General, 871 United Nations Plaza, First Avenue, at 49th Street, (212) 610-9700, germany.info/nyevents. (Smith)
'Macho Man, Tell It To My Heart: Collected by Julie Ault' (through Feb. 23) Julie Ault, an artist, writer and curator, was a founding member of the New York collaborative Group Material, which, from the late 1970s to the late 1990s, used exhibitions and public events to investigate the overlap of art and politics. During decades of depression, inflation, multiculturalism, conservatism and AIDS, she and her colleagues lived improvised lives on the city's fringes. Within their world, art was currency for giving gifts, bartering, buying and selling among friends. This show, spread over two different locations, is a moving record of such transactions. Artists Space, 38 Greene Street, at Grand Street, SoHo; Artists Space: Books & Talks, 55 Walker Street, between Church Street and Broadway, TriBeCa, (212) 226-3970, artistsspace.org. (Cotter)
Out of Town
Carnegie Museum of Art: 2013 Carnegie International (through March 16) A welcome shock to the system of one of the art world's more entrenched rituals, this lean, seemingly modest, thought-out exhibition takes the big global survey of contemporary art off steroids. It is mostly devoid of the looming, often expensive installations called "festival art," while evincing a gratifying affinity for color, form, beauty and pleasure, and a discernible lack of interest in finger-wagging didacticism. Object-making of all kinds seems healthy, as do artist-initiated activist projects (which sometimes overlap). Interventionist and artist-as-curator efforts? Not as impressive. 4400 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, (412) 622-3131, carnegieinternational.org. (Smith)
National Gallery of Art: 'Heaven and Earth: Art of Byzantium From Greek Collections' (through March 2) With about 170 objects, this show takes a processional sweep through Byzantine art from its Greco-Roman beginnings to its multicultural late phase in the 15th century, with a specific emphasis on its development in Greece itself. The history is fascinating, and the objects couldn't be more beautiful, including a glinting 13th-century icon of the Virgin and Child pieced together from glass, silver, gold and glass; a 17-foot-long parchment scroll painted with chirping birds and secret prayers; and a heavenly silk embroidery, found stashed away in a Thessaloniki church, depicting the body of the dead Christ surrounded by fan-wielding seraphs and a stitched chant, "Holy, holy, holy." On the National Mall, between Third and Seventh Streets, at Constitution Avenue NW, Washington, (202) 737-4215, nga.gov. (Cotter)
Last Chance
Asia Society and Museum: 'Iran Modern' (closes on Sunday) Most accounts of modern art say, basically, one thing: The West creates while the world waits, like a grateful beggar, for a nourishing handout. This is false history. Modernism has always been a global adventure happening for different reasons, in different ways, on different schedules, everywhere. That America and Europe are still barely awake to this reality makes an exhibition like "Iran Modern" invaluable, educationally. That the show is also good-looking, threaded through with human drama, and composed of work that is both cosmopolitan and, over all, like no other art, doesn't hurt. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 288-6400, asiasociety.org/nyc. (Cotter)
Peter Doig: 'Early Work' (closes on Saturday) For a good sense of how much trial, error and relentless experimentation goes into finding artistic maturity, see this excellent show. A total of 12 paintings and 26 drawings that Mr. Doig made in the 1980s, when he was in his 20s, attest to the interests in pulsating color and paint application that distinguish his later work. Otherwise, he covered the waterfront, learning from Sigmar Polke and Jörg Immendorff, cartooning, photography, Munch, Miró and, from Chicago, the Hairy Who. Michael Werner, 4 East 77th Street, (212) 988-1623, michaelwerner.com. (Smith)
Emmet Gowin: 'Landscapes Andalucía' (closes on Saturday) After a 10-year hiatus, Mr. Gowin returns to the air, this time above Spain, for a series of stunning color aerial photographs of Andalucía. There are occasional glimpses of the city of Granada, but the most lasting impression is of the interplay among cultivated lands, planted with different crops and trees, and wild, untamable ravines and mountains. The images offer majestic proof of the ageless collaboration between human beings and nature -- and the latter's supremacy. Pace/MacGill Gallery, 32 East 57th Street, ninth floor, (212) 759-7999, pacemacgill.com. (Smith)
Guggenheim Museum: 'Robert Motherwell: Early Collages' (closes on Sunday) Motherwell (1915-91) had a ground-level role in creating the art brand called Abstract Expressionism, with its vaunted channeling of feeling through painterly gesture. But in the 1940s, when he was editing art books and immersed in Dada, his medium of choice was the relatively gesture-free one of collage, mostly made of cut-and-torn paper with paint added. The work from this time, roughly 1940 to 1951, was the most inventive and varied of his career. If you long ago gave up on him as a one-idea artist, based on overexposure to his "Elegy to the Spanish Republic" series, have a look at this jumpy, mettlesome early stuff. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Cotter)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Interwoven Globe: The Worldwide Textile Trade, 1500-1800' (closes on Sunday) The latest Met extravaganza crisscrosses cultures in Europe, the Americas, Asia and India with rare abandon (for the Met), retracing early oceanic trade routes via examples of the fabrics and finished textiles that traveled along them and spread ideas about design, technique and fashion. The resulting feast of transcendent artifacts variously embroidered, woven, dyed and printed is one of the greatest, most multicultural art experiences of the season. Hybridity, a fashionable art-world buzzword, is shown to be as old as the sea. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Julia Margaret Cameron' (closes on Sunday) Julia Margaret Cameron took up the camera rather late in her life, at 48, but very early in the life of photography. And as much as anyone of her time, this 19th-century Englishwoman (1815-79) helped the nascent medium grow into a viable art form. The 38 works here, portraits and allegorical groupings from the museum's collection, highlight the sometimes controversial techniques (moody lighting, shallow depth of field, long exposure times and a soft focus) that gave her pictures exceptional vulnerability, spirituality and candor. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Medieval Treasures From Hildesheim' (closes on Sunday) Smack in the middle of the Metropolitan Museum, there's a nugget of compressed light called "Medieval Treasures From Hildesheim." Visually, the show is eminently graspable: a one-room cluster of some 50 objects, many jewel-encrusted or covered in gold. In other ways, the art is almost beyond reach, being about the power politics of spirituality in a distant age. Look closely, though. Everyday realism and the human touch are everywhere here, sweet and radiant. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)
Morgan Library and Museum: 'Tiepolo, Guardi, and Their World: Eighteenth Century Venetian Drawings' (closes on Sunday) Intended to show off the Morgan's impressive collection of Venetian drawings, this approximately 100-piece show is dominated by the father-and-son team of Giambattista and Domenico Tiepolo. Giambattista's tremulous studies of soaring angels, saints and mythological figures define one extreme of Venetian culture; Domenico's earthy, rowdy caricatures of commedia dell'arte figures, the other. In between are city views in which the two worlds sometimes meet, as they do in Francesco Guardi's marvelous sketch of crowds gathering beneath the portico of the Dogana da Mar to witness the launching of a manned balloon. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Rosenberg)
Museum of Modern Art: 'New Photography 2013' (closes on Monday) Conceptualism overrides image-making here. Josephine Pryde's photographs of guinea pigs refer to the pre-20th-century slave trade. Lisa Oppenheim's photograms of textiles are about women's labor and colonialism. Eileen Quinlan's seemingly abstract images of folded yoga mats have to do with feminist issues. Annette Kelm's portraits and still lifes deconstruct commercial photography. Anna Ostoya's montages address relations between men and women as well as the art worlds of Eastern Europe and the United States. Adam Broomberg and Oliver Chanarin silk-screen new war photographs into a book of old war images by Bertolt Brecht. And Brendan Fowler assembles framed, enlarged snapshots into abrasive abstract sculptures. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Johnson)
Philadelphia Museum of Art: 'Léger: Modern Art and the Metropolis' (closes on Sunday) This handsome, illuminating multimedia show takes a memorably broad approach to a narrow slice of Léger's art -- the decade after 1918 when he was most enamored of and energized by the rapidly growing modernity of Paris. Spanning from film to architectural plans, it situates his art among that of about 40 of his like-minded artist-friends and collaborators, and has the mood of a crowded, high-spirited reunion. Benjamin Franklin Parkway at 26th Street, (215) 763-8100, philamuseum.org. (Smith)
Lui Shtini: 'Face Paintings' (closes on Saturday) In his third New York gallery show, this young Albanian-born painter breaks through to a weird, personal style full of possibility. Small oil-on-board works harbor largely faceless portraits, oddly hopeful presences denoted by two or three stacked, no-neck symmetrical shapes. Each shape and all backgrounds are madly and inventively textured in colors either eccentric or black. The show suggests that the artist has just discovered and is now exploring the wonders of oil paint. Carry on. Kate Werble Gallery, 83 Van Dam Street, SoHo, (212) 352-9700, katewerblegallery.com. (Smith)
Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Robert Indiana: Beyond Love' (closes on Sunday) This terrific show will be a revelation for viewers who know Mr. Indiana only for his famous representations of the word "love" with the suggestively tilted "o." There are several versions in two and three dimensions here, but most of the show consists of non-"love" paintings of words and numbers rendered in graphically punchy compositions from the 1960s. Many are morally and politically fraught. Among the simplest are those that have the words "Eat" and "Die" in monumental block letters within bold circles; they're like signs for a greasy-spoon diner in an existentialist film noir. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Johnson)

Abstract: Raising the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour by 2016, as the current Democratic bill would do, would directly or indirectly increase the take-home pay of 27.8 million workers, according to the Economic Policy Institute, adding $35 billion in greater wages through 2016.

Full text:   Aided by a vast flow of corporate and right-wing money, Republicans have spent years persuading the public that the deficit is the nation's biggest financial problem and that austerity is the answer to it. Their success in making that argument -- keeping taxes and government investment low -- has helped increase American income inequality to crisis proportions: 95 percent of the income gains since 2009 have gone to the top 1 percent. The majority of the country has stagnated or lost ground, leaving the economy sluggish.
Democrats have largely been passive or defensive as all the wage increases flowed upward, but they have vowed to take a more aggressive stand this year. Last week, they announced a nationwide campaign in 2014 for a higher minimum wage, showing how it would help the economy and reduce inequality, while highlighting the cost of the adamant Republican opposition to the idea. They also plan to press for wage-increase referendums in states with crucial Congressional races this November.
It's smart politics. More than three-quarters of Americans support a wage higher than the current $7.25 an hour, and Republicans will be hard-pressed to explain why they oppose it. The issue might bring people to the polls who would otherwise be indifferent to midterm Congressional elections.
But more important, it's good economics, and it would benefit tens of millions of people. Raising the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour by 2016, as the current Democratic bill would do, would directly or indirectly increase the take-home pay of 27.8 million workers, according to the Economic Policy Institute, adding $35 billion in greater wages through 2016. The resulting increase in gross domestic product would create 85,000 new jobs.
The minimum wage would still not go high enough, fast enough. If it had kept pace with inflation, it would now be $10.77 an hour. But at least the Democratic bill, sponsored by Representative George Miller of California and Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, would, for the first time, automatically index the wage to inflation each year after 2016.
Republicans have reflexively opposed any mandate that would force their business supporters to reward workers for the increased productivity. Some want to abolish the minimum wage altogether. In March, every Republican in the House voted against a measure to raise the minimum wage. "When you raise the price of employment, guess what happens? You get less of it," said Speaker John Boehner in February, espousing a party-line theory that most economists agree has been discredited.
This campaign, if Democrats fully pursue it, could help demonstrate to voters how intransigent Republicans have been on the most fundamental and popular elements of a strong recovery. Most do not even acknowledge that the country has an inequality problem, and they have systematically worked to deny those at the bottom and in the middle from access to food stamps, health insurance and unemployment benefits. It's no surprise that the only thing Republicans want to discuss are the stumbles of health care reform. An aggressive stand on inequality issues could knock them out of that loop.
As important as a minimum-wage increase would be, Democrats shouldn't stop there. It would be heartening to see the party give the same support to other aspects of Mr. Obama's inequality agenda, including universal preschool, career and technical education, infrastructure investment and stronger collective-bargaining laws. But working toward a decent paycheck is a good place to start.

Abstract: Nelson Mandela was sentenced to life in prison, and Lyndon Johnson single-handedly sent everyone into a tizzy by signing the Civil Rights Act, sending more "advisers" to Vietnam, talking about bombing North Vietnam and proposing the Great Society. Reagan was implicated in the Iran-contra cover-up, but it seemed more important to torture the Clintons over a bad real estate investment.

Full text:   War, famine, pestilence and death -- the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse -- have been well represented in years ending in "4," but probably not disproportionately so. A look at memorable moments in the last seven of these just might lead to optimism for the one that's upon us. Or not.
1944 Those of us who don't remember this year are lucky; a soldier cited in Rick Atkinson's brilliantly horrifying saga of the last two years of the war in Europe, "The Guns at Last Light," quotes King Lear: "The worst is not, So long as we can say, 'This is the worst.' " The end of the war was in sight; getting there was the trick, and millions were killed in the interval. Things have not been this bad since.
1954 If there was a golden era of United States foreign policy, it ended here, as Eisenhower warned against involvement in Vietnam while espousing the domino theory. Good: Joe McCarthy's power began to ebb. Not good: The words "under God" were added to the Pledge of Allegiance.
1964 The last year of the baby boom was mind-blowing. In the 28 months beginning that January, Bob Dylan made five of the best albums of the era -- and there were the Beatles.
Nelson Mandela was sentenced to life in prison, and Lyndon Johnson single-handedly sent everyone into a tizzy by signing the Civil Rights Act, sending more "advisers" to Vietnam, talking about bombing North Vietnam and proposing the Great Society. Huh? The first anti-Vietnam War demonstrations and draft-card burnings took place. Pot smoking officially began. (Not really, but sorta.)
The civil-rights workers Schwerner, Goodman and Chaney were found dead; just writing that gives me chills.
1974 The mid-70s were glum. We can gloat about Nixon's resignation, though don't forget he founded the Environmental Protection Agency. Gerald Ford gave his predecessor a better deal than he gave draft evaders. He also determined that we needed to Whip Inflation Now, as oil passed $10 a barrel. Everyone made jokes about him, with reason.
Patty Hearst was kidnapped. Ted Bundy disappeared many people. Augusto Pinochet declared himself "supreme chief" of Chile and disappeared many more.
The high point may have been the Ramones' debut at CBGB.
1984 Big Brother was not (yet) our biggest problem, but this was not a good year. President Reagan, presumably not yet stricken by Alzheimer's, remarked over an open mike that the bombing of Russia would begin "in five minutes." Geraldine Ferraro became a vice-presidential candidate, and lost. Margaret Thatcher went to war with miners, and won. Indira Gandhi was assassinated and a Union Carbide leak in Bhopal killed untold thousands.
The virus that causes AIDS was discovered. People started smoking crack. And Marvin Gaye was shot and killed by his father.
1994 Whoa: Not only did Nelson Mandela not spend his life in jail, but he became president. The Brady Law went into effect, and Bill Clinton signed the assault weapons ban. (It expired in 2004.) O. J. Simpson spurred a national obsession. Four bombers were convicted of the 1993 attack on the World Trade Center.
Reagan was implicated in the Iran-contra cover-up, but it seemed more important to torture the Clintons over a bad real estate investment. (Still, Paula Jones wasn't the Republicans' fault, was she?) Clinton fired Joycelyn Elders for discussing masturbation.
The first credit default swap was created. Nearly everyone in Rwanda became either a killer or a victim, or so it seemed. And there was that messy thing in "the former Yugoslavia."
Netscape Navigator was released.
2004 Barack Obama spoke at the Democratic convention and there seemed reason for hope; then John Kerry went windsurfing and W., incredibly, became president again (what were 62 million of us thinking?) several months after endorsing a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage, which Massachusetts had already legalized. (By 2013, even Utah is on the right side of this issue.) W. also promised to improve education and access to health care; we all know how that worked out. Lance Armstrong won his sixth Tour de France; we all know how that worked out, too.
The Indian Ocean tsunami killed more than 230,000 people. Martha Stewart went to jail. And Johnny Ramone (born 1948) died.
2014 President Obama is calling this the "year of action." Here's hoping he's not bluffing and begins by demonstrating how popular progressive legislation is by circumventing Congress in areas of food, energy and climate change. The alternative could be a visit by the Four Horsemen.

China Seeks to Rein In Lending, and Tremors Result

Full text:   HONG KONG -- China's financial system is in danger of becoming too big to bail out.
Official bank lending has more than doubled since the global financial crisis, growing nearly twice as fast as the overall economy. The even bigger problem, however, appears to come from the rise of a shadow banking system that has allowed a number of companies and individuals, often with political connections, to borrow from state-controlled banks at low interest rates and relend the money at much higher rates to private businesses desperate for credit at almost any price.
Now, in an effort to wean the banks and the economy off their addiction to such risky practices, Beijing has pledged to deliver what amounts to the country's most sweeping financial overhaul in decades. Markets will play the "decisive" role in directing the economy, policy makers promised last month after a key plenum meeting of the Communist Party leadership. Interest rates are to be liberalized, cross-border investment will be welcomed and regional and bureaucratic protectionism will be curtailed, they declared.
But already, even relatively modest government moves are producing turbulence in money markets; just this week China's central bank was forced to back off, at least temporarily, to avoid putting too much stress on the banking system and potentially drawing an angry reaction from powerful vested interests in China accustomed to paying very little for their loans.
"It's been pretty clear since June, and especially clear since the plenum, that the new crowd is interested in tightening monetary policy and letting interest rates rise," said Arthur R. Kroeber, the Beijing-based managing director of GK Dragonomics, an economic research firm. "The purpose is to reduce the rate at which credit is expanding, which has been a bit of a problem over the last couple of years."
China has experimented twice this year with much higher, market-driven interest rates. As with a similar experiment in June, the central bank allowed rates late last week and early this week to soar to unsustainable levels. Instead of regularly scheduled open-market operations, the bank tried unconventional methods of guiding money markets.
That approach involved the central bank's turning to posts on China's Twitter-like social messaging service, Sina Weibo, to chasten banks to "make rational adjustments to the structure of their assets and liabilities, and improve their liquidity management using a scientific and long-term approach."
But as in June, the experiment did not last long. On Tuesday, China's central bank, the People's Bank of China, provided a direct injection of fresh money after the market pushed seven-day interest rates to nearly 10 percent, double their earlier level. The central bank's action eased pressure on the financial system and quelled fears of an immediate credit crisis. But rates remain elevated, and the bank may have only postponed the moment of reckoning for a few months.
"The key message from the current central bank-induced tightness is deleveraging," said Stephen Green, the head of research for greater China at Standard Chartered. "We'll see what happens when we see greater levels of corporate distress in 2014, whether Beijing buckles or not."
A complex and loosely regulated network of financial go-betweens has sprung up to profit from repackaging and reselling China's new mountains of debt, turning loans into investment products. Such products have become popular among ordinary investors in China because they pay much higher interest rates than deposits in savings accounts, where rates are capped by the government to protect the state-owned banking system from competition.
But loosely regulated financial businesses can make a dicey business model, as Wall Street learned in 2008. And they pose a particular threat in an economy where growth is slowing, as it has been in China for the last three years.
"The final users of the money will not be able to earn returns high enough to repay the money and promised interest," said Yu Yongding, a senior fellow at the Institute of World Economics and Politics of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and a former member of the monetary policy committee at China's central bank. "The chains of lending and borrowing can be long, just like the securitized subprime mortgages. The result can be devastating."
Indeed, the real-life stress tests the central bank has been experimenting with are not without casualties. As markets became jittery in the run-up to the June credit crunch, two branches of the state-owned China Everbright Bank technically defaulted on 6.5 billion renminbi, or $1.1 billion, worth of short-term payments.
In a regulatory disclosure that was part of its $3 billion Hong Kong share offering earlier this month, the Everbright Bank explained that while it had sufficient financing and liquidity at the corporate level, "the branches did not manage to fulfill their obligations to repay short-term interbank loans." Instead, the payments were settled a day late.
The bank said that in response to the episode and to the greater volatility in China's bank-to-bank lending market, it had increased reserve levels and "emphasized among our departments the overriding importance of sound liquidity."
The big risk for China's cosseted banks is not necessarily bank runs of the sort seen in the early 1930s in the United States, with depositors lining up to withdraw money before a bank can fail. The Chinese authorities have made clear that they will not tolerate disorderly closures of banks, and over the years have reportedly rushed cash to banks that faced sudden withdrawals.
Instead, the greater worry has been what some experts describe as "a walk on the banks" -- depositors steadily removing their savings from banks after losing enthusiasm for deposit rates that have long been set by regulation at levels often below the inflation rate and only occasionally slightly above it. That slow drain could imperil the banks' ability to continue pumping ever-larger loans to state-owned enterprises and politically connected individuals, even when many of those loans appear to be for helping borrowers repay previous loans.
Banks in China have been able to stay profitable while lending at low rates only because the government has required all of them to pay even lower rates for deposits. Savers have had few alternatives to banks until very recently: Real estate prices are already stratospheric relative to incomes, the weakly regulated and highly speculative domestic stock markets are widely distrusted and shadow banking businesses are periodically reined in by the government.
Total credit in China, although growing fast, remains slightly smaller relative to economic output than in the West. The worry is that the eventual proportion of nonperforming loans may prove even higher than other countries have had to manage, while China's less developed financial system may make it hard to bail out less regulated entities, even as the central bank retains tighter links to the four main state-owned banks.
While policy makers say they are worried about upsetting the delicate mechanisms of the current banking system, public criticism continues to grow, even within China's elite. That suggests further market-oriented experiments could be coming soon.
"Banking in China has become like a highway toll system," Yao Jingyuan, the former chief economist at the state statistics agency, said late last week during a speech at Nanjing University, according to numerous Chinese news reports. "Banks charge every time money goes through them."
"With this kind of operational model," Mr. Yao added, "banks will continue making money even if all the bank presidents go home to sleep and you replaced them by putting a small dog in their seats."

Full text:   LONDON -- European economic recoveries are graded on a curve these days.
Ireland's public debt has soared and unemployment is at 12.5 percent, but at least it left the European bailout program. Spain might have Depression-era levels of unemployment, but its recession ended last quarter, after its economy posted growth of a mere tenth of a percentage point. The Italian economy did not grow at all in the third quarter, but that was better than the previous two years of recession.
And then there is Britain.
When George Osborne, chancellor of the Exchequer, presented his autumn statement to the Parliament early this month, it was delivered with an edge of triumphalism. Output has been accelerating this year, with annual growth of 1.4 percent expected, more than twice what the International Monetary Fund projected in April. Unemployment has fallen to 7.4 percent, the envy of the euro zone, where the average is more than 12 percent.
Few predicted the pace of the British recovery, and the success, however limited, has provoked a proliferation of views on its causes and long-term prospects. Analyses have run the gamut. The Economist called Britain's recovery "firing on one cylinder," while a Times of London headline proclaimed, "Growth up, deficit down -- what's not to like?" Explaining what prompted Britain's recovery is a kind of economic policy Rorschach test. Are the austerity policies choking Europe's growth or fostering it?
Mr. Osborne, a member of the ruling Conservative Party, hailed the recent upturn as evidence that his austerity policies were working, and promised more of the same. "The central task of reforming government and controlling spending does not simply dissolve when growth returns," he said. "An improving economy does not let us off the hook for taking the difficult decisions to make sure government lives within its means."
When Ed Balls of the opposition Labour Party delivered his rebuttal, he said that "after three damaging and wasted years, for most people in the constituencies of all our members on all sides of this house, there is still no recovery at all."
As he spoke, clashing jeers and hoots in the chamber became so boisterous that the Parliament's speaker admonished one member to calm down and "take up yoga."
In truth, Britain's recovery is not much of an argument for austerity.
Gross domestic product is not expected to return to 2007 levels until next year. In the United States, by contrast, output is nearly 6 percent above where it was in 2007. And per capita output will not reach 2007 levels in Britain until 2018, according to International Monetary Fund projections. Pay continues to lag inflation, while business investment and exports have been weak.
Then there are worries that government policies aimed at making it easier to buy a home have overheated the housing market. Public debt has doubled since 2007, to nearly 89 percent of output, according to Eurostat.
"The current policies have been disastrous," said Richard Portes, a professor of economics at the London Business School and founder of the Centre for Economic Policy Research, an influential London-based group. "My view is pretty much the view I had a little over three years ago when I said the austerity program would be a disaster. And it has been. It has been responsible for the painfully slow recovery."
He called the government's "Help to Buy" housing plan "just simply crazy."
The program offers first-time home buyers, and buyers moving into newly built houses worth up to 600,000 pounds, or nearly $1 million, the opportunity to put only 5 percent down and receive a government loan of up to 20 percent of the purchase price.
"We're deliberately going back to what was ruinous in the past," Mr. Portes said.
Nicholas Spiro, managing director of Spiro Sovereign Strategy, said, "This still looks and feels like the wrong kind of growth: an almost entirely consumer-led recovery that worryingly resembles the last property-fueled boom." He added, "Everything's far too dependent on household consumption."
Mark Carney, the new governor of the Bank of England, appears to be pushing the government to rein in its aggressive housing policies. Last month, he curbed, with Mr. Osborne's support, a "Funding for Lending" program that offered banks financial support for their lending, limiting it in the future only to business loans. And he has said "Help to Buy" is not markedly increasing the construction of houses in the country, as had been hoped.
Jamie Dannhauser, director of the research group at Lombard Street Research, said of the recovery: "The strength of it has taken everyone by surprise, myself included. Even people who were relatively optimistic about the U.K. were not forecasting the growth that we've seen in the last six months."
While he was more upbeat than Mr. Portes, he doubted the pace could be sustained. "I don't expect this rate of growth to be evident much beyond the near term," he said. "The data as it stands at the moment isn't enormously encouraging. You've had a lot of consumer demand and rising government spending, and you haven't seen a recovery in business investment or in exports.
"The key question now is to see whether business investment comes back over the next 12 months," he said.
Austerity, of course, has many adherents. "I think it has worked, in the sense that anything that keeps the government out of private enterprise's hair is a good idea," said Nick Beecroft, chairman of Saxo Capital Markets.
"The time to be most on your guard is when things seem to be moving smoothly," Mr. Beecroft said.
Certainly, Britain is one of European austerity's best cases. As much of the rest of Europe has shown, it could be worse.

Full text:   AUSTIN, Tex. -- WITH the recent congressional budget negotiations putting a spotlight on the need to raise revenues, and with our transportation infrastructure in many places crumbling before our eyes, it is time to consider modernizing the gas tax. Doing so would help fill the budget gap while updating and improving our transportation systems.
The Highway Trust Fund depends on federal fuel taxes for its finances. And those taxes have remained stuck for two decades at 18.4 and 24.4 cents per gallon for gasoline and diesel, respectively. State taxes tack on another 31.1 cents per gallon on average.
Keep this fact in mind: There were about 260 million Americans in 1993 when the tax was last raised. Today there are over 315 million. And we travel more miles than we did two decades ago. That means the transportation infrastructure has to do more with less per-mile spending, adjusted for inflation. That's why we see crumbling bridges on the news, outdated traffic-light patterns and clogged roads.
And, as we move into cities and use mass transit we will drive less. As cars become more fuel efficient they require less gasoline. At the same time, alternatively fueled cars such as electric vehicles don't pay gasoline taxes at all, and others, such as natural gas vehicles, pay a lower rate on average, so the current system subsidizes their use. That means our gasoline purchases -- and our gas taxes -- are declining, putting a strain on our trust fund.
The problem is already acute. Since 2000, spending by the highway fund has generally outpaced revenues; since 2008, the fund has required an infusion of $41 billion from the federal government's general fund. By 2015, the highway fund is expected to spend more than $53 billion while collecting less than $39 billion, leaving a shortfall that Congress will be forced to make up.
As Kim P. Cawley of the Congressional Budget Office argued this summer in testimony before a House subcommittee, "The current trajectory of the highway trust fund is unsustainable."
One choice, of course, would be to raise the gas tax. But this would surely raise the ire of many people and might be politically untenable. Some people have proposed a vehicle miles traveled tax, which could use fancy technologies like onboard GPS or mobile apps to track where we go and levy a fee in real time based on the distance, similar to electronic toll collection systems like E-ZPass. But these contraptions raise concerns about civil liberties and privacy protections (as the black box could report your whereabouts to authorities), and the extra technology might be costly to install. A blunt V.M.T. tax also misses the fact that a light car does a lot less damage to the roads than a heavy truck.
A better option is a "ton mile" fee based on how far vehicles travel and how heavy they are, so that all drivers pay their fair share to fix the resulting road damage. A one-ton car (which is typical for a compact car) that is driven 7,500 miles annually inflicts much less road damage than a two-ton truck that is driven 15,000 miles. While the gas tax captures some of that difference, as the truck driver would buy more fuel, it is not perfectly aligned.
Assessing a half-cent fee per ton mile would cost a typical American car owner about $50 per year and would cover the highway fund's revenue shortfall, according to my calculations. And, rather than using tracking devices, the fee could be assessed during an annual sticker renewal or inspection that is conducted at state level: All the inspector has to do is read the odometer, look up the gross vehicle weight of the car's make and model, then assess the fee. With a fee on the order of two cents per ton mile, gas and diesel taxes could be eliminated entirely.
So politicians could be credited for lowering the cost of gasoline at the pump while building a system that created fair competition between each fuel.
Switching to a ton mile fee solves several problems at once: It raises the revenues we need for our transportation projects while ensuring that electric and natural gas vehicles don't get a free pass. It would also encourage people to drive smaller cars fewer miles, which would achieve additional benefits like reduced petroleum consumption, emissions, traffic congestion and wear and tear on the roads and highways.
Republicans should like it because it would end the subsidies for alternatively fueled vehicles, and Democrats should like it because it would encourage energy conservation. In this new phase of partisan agreement on budgets, revising the gas tax would be one more step in the right direction.

Full text:   NEW DELHI -- Ever since independence, New Delhi's leaders have commandeered the city's most valuable real estate for themselves -- living in the same bungalows behind the same walls left by British colonialists.
But on Monday, Arvind Kejriwal, Delhi's new chief minister, vowed for the first time to break from India's colonial past by promising that neither he nor his ministers would take up residence in those sumptuous homes.
He also promised to do away with a culture of privilege that allows ministers and top bureaucrats to zip through Delhi's traffic in motorcades with police escorts and flashing lights.
In a letter dated Monday, a top Delhi police official wrote to Mr. Kejriwal's private secretary that "Delhi police needs to give the security to him as per the norms," and asked where the vast police detail should be sent.
In a handwritten response, Mr. Kejriwal wrote that he did not need security.
"God is my biggest security," he wrote.
He did add, however, that he "would be grateful if some help is provided for crowd management or screening at a few places where I get mobbed."
Mr. Kejriwal's elevation to chief minister of India's capital city is among the most unlikely and meteoric rises to power in Indian history. At 45, he is Delhi's youngest chief minister ever, replacing a woman 30 years his senior.
A former tax commissioner, Mr. Kejriwal gained national attention three years ago as the top adviser to Anna Hazare, the activist who has pushed India's Parliament to adopt legislation creating an independent corruption monitor. The movement fell apart amid resistance from the governing United Progressive Alliance and growing tension between Mr. Hazare and Mr. Kejriwal.
Mr. Hazare continued to push for the legislation but believed he needed to do so in a nonpartisan way. Mr. Kejriwal disagreed, saying the failure of the movement meant he needed to become directly involved in electoral politics. So last year he formed his own party -- known as Aam Aadmi, or Common Man -- and declared his intention to fight in Delhi's state elections.
Whispers among Delhi's political establishment suggested that he had no chance of competing in a system known for corrupt payouts and among voters who expected handouts. But two weeks ago, Aam Aadmi won 28 seats in Delhi's elections, compared with eight by the once-dominant Indian National Congress Party. Most embarrassing, Sheila Dikshit, the Congress Party's longtime chief minister, was crushed in her own constituency. Those results may signal that India's longtime political dynasty, the family of Sonia and Rahul Gandhi, could soon lose its grip on power.
The Bharatiya Janata Party, a Hindu nationalist party, won 31 seats in Delhi's elections and was initially asked to form a government. But neither of the Hindu party's rivals would lend support, so Mr. Kejriwal's turn came.
Whether Mr. Kejriwal was willing to govern with help from the Congress Party, which he had criticized as hopelessly corrupt, was the much-asked question.
Mr. Kejriwal asked the people. More than half a million sent emails and text messages, and the party reported that the overwhelming response was that he should govern.
"It is not me who will be the chief minister," Mr. Kejriwal told reporters in his office on Monday. "It will be Delhi's common man who will be the chief minister. Alone I cannot do anything."
Significant challenges remain. Delhi is one of the world's most polluted and crowded cities. A third of its residents live in slums with little access to sanitation or clean water; its electricity is fitful and its roads and infrastructure poor. Inflation is soaring, and India's economy is flagging.
While he based his campaign on eliminating corruption, Mr. Kejriwal also promised to slash electricity rates in half and give free water to every Delhi household. He also promised to build 200,000 community and public toilets.
"It is easy to lead a movement but difficult to run a political party," said Sudha Pai, a political science professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University. "Now they have to deliver on their promises of cheap electricity, free water and corruption-free government. Those are not easy promises to fulfill."

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The United States economy grew at a surprisingly robust 4.1 percent annual pace in the third quarter, the Commerce Department said on Friday. It was the strongest advance in nearly two years and only the third time the economy had expanded that quickly from one quarter to the next since 2006.
It is the latest evidence that the generally sluggish recovery is gaining strength, though economists noted that the rate of growth over a longer period remained at a trot, not a gallop -- a pace of about 2.5 percent a year.
"We continue to believe that underlying growth will remain on a moderate trend," said Joshua Shapiro, the chief United States economist at MFR, a consulting firm. "The outlook is greatly dependent on the direction of the labor market, and hence the path of wage and salary growth and the ability of consumers to expand spending."
With stronger growth, the job market is improving, but earnings and employment remain far from healthy levels, economists say. The unemployment rate fell to 7 percent in November from 7.8 percent a year earlier. But that improvement is to a substantial extent because workers are leaving the labor force, not because of a greater number of jobs. At the same time, many working households continue to struggle because stagnant incomes have barely kept up with the modest pace of inflation.
Still, the Commerce Department data, which raised the estimate of third-quarter growth from an earlier 3.6 percent, shows more evidence of broad-based growth that might lead to a healthier labor market and more solid growth in 2014.
President Obama seized on the figures at his news conference on Friday. "We head into next year with an economy that's stronger than it was when we started the year," he said. "Our businesses are positioned for new growth and new jobs. And I firmly believe that 2014 can be a breakthrough year for America."
The refined estimate is based on "more complete source data," the department said, that showed personal consumption and business investment to be higher than previously thought. Those figures came in "dramatically better than initially expected after an unusually large series of surprises," said Morgan Stanley economists in a note to clients, calling the government release a generally "strong report." Economists had expected the final estimate of growth to be unchanged from the earlier 3.6 percent. But the data showed that consumers stepped up their spending on health care, houses and cars as the strengthening recovery led businesses to hire, and that rising home values had improved household balance sheets.
The Commerce Department increased its estimate of growth in consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of economic activity, to a 2 percent rate from 1.4 percent.
The economy's general strength has spurred the Federal Reserve to begin to unwind its bond-buying program, cutting its monthly purchases of Treasury and mortgage-backed debt. "In light of the cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the improvement in the outlook for labor market conditions, the committee decided to modestly reduce the pace of its asset purchases," the Fed said in a statement this week.
The third-quarter growth came from a broad range of other sources: personal consumption, exports, investment in new factories and houses, state and local government spending and a rise in business inventories. Federal spending cuts and rising imports were a drag on growth, the department said.
Economists expect growth to retreat in the fourth quarter, in part because of the temporary government shutdown in October, but mostly because some of the upswing was driven by businesses building up their inventories. That activity is expected to slow this winter.
While Wall Street "has been concerned with the swing in fiscal policy between 2013 and 2014, they should be focused on the swing likely in inventory," said Steven Ricchiuto, the chief economist at Mizuho Securities USA, in an email. Even so, economists said that the underlying pace of growth remained strong enough to expect a better 2014 than 2013.
"The third quarter's stellar growth rate is not destined to be repeated, but is it a harbinger of a better year for the economy in 2014," said Douglas Handler, the chief United States economist for IHS Global Insight, who cited strength in the housing market and in exports.
Macroeconomic Advisers, a forecasting firm based in St. Louis, expects growth to slow to a 2.3 percent pace in the fourth quarter -- roughly in line with the 2.5 percent rate during the second quarter -- before picking up again next year.
"Receding fiscal drag, the waning effects of the sharp rise in yields since earlier in the year, continued improvement in credit terms and equities and building confidence underlie the move to growth of 3 percent or above over the next few years," the firm said this week.
The easing of cutbacks and uncertainty from Washington should also bolster growth in the months ahead, analysts say, This year, the end of a payroll tax holiday and the imposition of broad-based spending cuts, known as sequestration, cut into the economy's expansion.
Next year, the end of extended unemployment insurance payments for the long-term jobless and cuts to the food stamps program will weigh on consumer spending and the overall recovery, but the scale of the drag should be much smaller.
"The economy is finishing 2013 in a stronger place than where it began the year," said Jason Furman, the chairman of the White House's Council of Economic Advisers, in a statement this week. "This is especially notable given the general fiscal environment, including the onset of the sequester in March."

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve said on Wednesday that it would gradually end its bond-buying program during 2014, a modest first step toward unwinding the central bank's broader stimulus campaign as its officials gain confidence that the economy is growing steadily.
The Fed plans to cut its monthly purchases of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities from $85 billion in December to nothing by the end of next year in a series of small steps, starting with a reduction to $75 billion in January, the central bank announced after a two-day meeting of its policy-making committee.
At the same time, the Fed sought to offset concerns that it was once again pulling back too soon by strengthening its plans to hold short-term interest rates near zero, which officials regard as a more powerful means of stimulating growth. Both policies aim to hold down borrowing costs and revive risk-taking.
The Fed's shift in policy, in effect, means it plans to do less now and more later. That is a result of a compromise that has been months in the making between a group of officials convinced that the economy needs more help, and a range of internal critics who regarded the bond-buying campaign as ineffective or dangerous.
The Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, insisted that the net effect was not a withdrawal of support for the economy.
"We are not doing less," he said at a news conference on Wednesday. "I think we have been aggressive to try to keep the economy growing, and we are seeing progress in the labor market. I would dispute the idea that we are not providing a lot of accommodation to the economy."
Investors appeared to agree with Mr. Bernanke, defying predictions that stock prices would retreat along with the Fed's pullback. Major stock indexes spiked when the Fed's statement was released at 2 p.m., and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 1.7 percent by the end of the trading day. Importantly, interest rates on benchmark bonds -- the rates the Fed is trying to influence -- ended the day roughly where they started.
One reason for investor enthusiasm, said Michael Hanson, senior economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, is the stimulus will be withdrawn very gradually.
The markets now have a clear -- though tentative -- schedule for the course of Fed policy over the next two years, including an end to asset purchases by late next year and a signal from Mr. Bernanke that the first increase in short-term interest rates is not likely to come until near the end of 2015.
That is particularly striking because the plan, set in the final months of Mr. Bernanke's tenure, will now define the first two years of the term of his successor, Janet Yellen, whom the Senate is expected to confirm this week. Mr. Bernanke said on Wednesday that Ms. Yellen "fully supports what we did today."
The Fed is struggling to calibrate its stimulus campaign in an environment of steady but mediocre growth. The unemployment rate has declined over the last year, reaching 7 percent in November. But that is still a high rate by historical standards, and other measures of the labor market look even worse. Wages are rising slowly, and the share of adults with jobs has not climbed since the recession.
A variety of indicators suggest the American economy may now be growing more quickly than analysts predicted, and Fed officials anticipate somewhat faster growth in the coming year. But the persistence of low inflation indicates the economy is operating well below its capacity.
Prices increased only 0.7 percent during the 12 months ending in October, according to a Commerce Department index that is the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation, well below the 2 percent pace the Fed considers healthy. Economic projections by Fed officials, also published on Wednesday, showed that the officials did not expect inflation to exceed 2 percent in the next three years.
In beginning its retreat, the Fed said that it expected inflation to slowly increase in coming years. But it also made clear, for the first time, that it did not intend to raise short-term rates until prices actually started to rise. In doing so, it joins a growing list of central banks grappling with the novel challenge of trying to drive up inflation after decades spent trying to drive it down.
"The committee is determined to avoid inflation that is too low, as well as inflation that is too high," Mr. Bernanke said at the news conference.
Some analysts saw an inconsistency between that rhetoric and the Fed's shift, however.
"The Federal Reserve essentially disregarded the trajectory of inflation in this decision," wrote Tim Duy, an economist at the University of Oregon.
Over the last year, the Fed has bought more than $1 trillion in Treasury and mortgage-backed securities in its effort to encourage job creation. Fed officials say the purchases have modestly reduced a range of borrowing costs, contributing, for example, to a rise in auto sales and an improving housing market. They say the program has also helped to revive an appetite for taking risks, driving up stock prices.
"The ripple effects go through the economy and bring benefits to, I would say, all Americans," Ms. Yellen said at her confirmation hearing last month.
But independent analysts have struggled to isolate the effects of the program. Some Fed officials, and outside analysts including some at the International Monetary Fund, also see evidence that the impact of the bond buying has diminished as markets have returned to normalcy. Officials are increasingly concerned as well about the potential consequences, including the disruption of financial markets and the difficulty of unwinding the program.
Fed officials also are frustrated that the bond-buying program has become a source of financial instability as investors hang on every shift in policy. Those concerns were reflected in the Fed's decision to announce not just an initial cut in bond buying, but a probable timetable for ending the purchases completely.
The policy shift won the support of Esther L. George, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, who has dissented at each previous meeting this year over concerns that the Fed was doing too much. But with the balance swinging in favor of her views, the decision drew a dissent from Eric S. Rosengren, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, who called it premature.
The decision won broad support from the policy-making committee, including most proponents of the overall stimulus campaign, because of the accompanying decision to strengthen the Fed's commitment to holding down interest rates.
Wednesday's announcement went well beyond the previous declaration of an intent to keep rates near zero at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6.5 percent. The Fed said instead that "it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate well past the time that the unemployment rate declines below 6 1/2 percent, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the committee's 2 percent longer-run goal."
Some economists doubt the power of such guidance, however, including Stanley Fischer, whom the White House plans to nominate as Ms. Yellen's vice chairman. Another critic of forward guidance, Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics and a former central banker at the Bank of England, described the "fine-tuning" in a Twitter message as "not-so-fine policy."
Stock prices fell earlier in the year when the Fed first talked about tapering, and the Wall Street economist Henry Kaufman of Henry Kaufman and Company was among the many who predicted a similar reaction once the Fed began to carry it out.
On Wednesday afternoon, he said that the Fed had succeeded instead in focusing the attention of investors on its forward guidance. "The market has concluded that the key issue is the level of short-term interest rates," he said. "That will allow the market to continue to be aggressive risk-takers, to make speculative investments."
Both the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and the Dow Jones industrial average reached new highs, without adjustment for inflation, with the Dow rising 292.71 points, or 1.8 percent, to close at 16,167.97, and the S.&P. 500 rising 29.65 points, or 1.7 percent, to 1,810.65. The Nasdaq composite index advanced 46.38 points, or 1.2 percent, to 4,070.06.
At the same time, the assurance that rates would remain low soothed bond investors. The yield on the Treasury's 10-year note rose to 2.89 percent from 2.84 percent late on Tuesday, while its price fell 16/32, to 98 24/32.

Abstract: Without the panoply of government benefits -- like food stamps, subsidized school lunches and the earned-income tax credit, which provides extra money to household heads earning low wages -- the nation's poverty rate last year would have reached almost 31 percent, up from 25 percent in 1967, according to the research at Columbia. Welfare reform in the mid-1990s, to a large extent, replaced cash payments with food stamps and an expanded earned-income tax credit.

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDEDWhen President Lyndon Johnson declared his war on poverty on Jan. 8, 1964, almost exactly 50 years ago, 19 percent of Americans were poor.
"The richest nation on earth can afford to win it," he reasoned, as he proposed a clutch of initiatives from expanding food stamps to revamping unemployment insurance. "We cannot afford to lose it."
A half-century later, our priorities have changed.
In November, food benefits were cut for approximately 48 million Americans by an average of 7 percent, costing the typical recipient about $9 a month, as the emergency expansion of the food stamp program enacted in the depths of the great recession was allowed to expire.
Next month, 1.3 million jobless workers are scheduled to stop receiving an unemployment check, after Congress's refusal to prolong the extension of emergency jobless benefits to up to 73 weeks, from 26. Perhaps as many as five million people will lose their benefit over the next year.
But while politicians' attention has wandered, poverty remains uncomfortably close to where it was five decades ago.
The official poverty rate today is 15 percent. But by a newly deployed, more comprehensive Census Bureau definition, which provides a more realistic tab on people's needs and takes into account the effect of government benefits, 16 percent of Americans are poor.
This is just 3 percentage points less than in 1967, the earliest year for which the data is available. It amounts to 50 million people.
Why so many still? Did the United States wage a war on poverty, lose and move on?
By the coarsest understanding of poverty the answer is no. Even the poor have made progress since the '60s as the nation's living standards have risen. If poverty were defined based on what people bought in 1967, adjusted only for inflation, the poverty rate would have fallen to about 11 percent today, according to research by Jane Waldfogel and other researchers at Columbia University.
But poverty is best measured relative to the actual living standards of our own society. By the standards of the 19th century, for instance, practically no American is poor. In comparison with Bangladeshis, there are precious few poor in the United States.
A more nuanced analysis of the evolution of poverty and America's efforts to combat it is not so consoling.
Recent research on poverty suggests that government programs have done, in fact, a much better job than the headline statistics suggest. The reason the poverty rate has budged so little is that the job of fixing it has gotten harder.
"The government is doing more to reduce poverty now than it did in the 1960s," Professor Waldfogel said.
Without the panoply of government benefits -- like food stamps, subsidized school lunches and the earned-income tax credit, which provides extra money to household heads earning low wages -- the nation's poverty rate last year would have reached almost 31 percent, up from 25 percent in 1967, according to the research at Columbia.
In 1967, government programs moved about 3 percent of children out of poverty. In 2012, they prevented 12 percent of children from dropping below the poverty line.
Hilary Hoynes of the University of California, Berkeley, explained why that has not made much of a dent in the numbers: "A flat poverty trend is better than we would have expected from the structural changes in the labor market."
Think of it this way: Despite a half-century worth of technological progress and some fairly robust economic growth for much of that time, the labor market does a worse job lifting people out of poverty today than it did before Neil Armstrong set foot on the moon.
Government transfers in the United States are far more meager than antipoverty efforts in other advanced nations.
In 2010, government transfers reduced the Dutch poverty rate -- defined as people with less than half the median income -- from 25 percent to 7.5 percent, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Government programs in the United States, on the equivalent measure, trimmed it to 17 percent from 28 percent.
Unemployment insurance here -- the main tool to shield workers from adverse turns of the economic cycle -- is far stingier than it is elsewhere. At the same time, Washington offers very little for adults without children on the assumption that they can and should work. But during a recession and periods of slack demand, that is impossible for many otherwise employable people.
Welfare reform in the mid-1990s, to a large extent, replaced cash payments with food stamps and an expanded earned-income tax credit. But the tax credit is of no use to those without jobs. "It is not well suited to provide traditional income insurance," Professor Hoynes said.
Importantly, government benefits can make it tough for people to leave poverty behind. "There's a lot of action at the very bottom," Professor Waldfogel said. "But once you hit the poverty line a lot goes away."
For a two-parent family with children and a breadwinner earning $25,000, it makes little financial sense for the other spouse to get a job. After subtracting taxes, lost government benefits and the added cost of child care, the family would take in only some 30 cents of each additional dollar, according to calculations by Melissa Kearney and Lesley Turner of the University of Maryland.
"There are huge work disincentives here," said Professor Kearney, who also runs the Hamilton Project at the Brookings Institution. "They should be allowed to keep more disposable income. They are doing -- quote, unquote -- what they are supposed to and they are not much better off than they were before."
And yet for all the shortcomings of the government's strategy, the main reason for America's persistent poverty is the disappearance of jobs with decent pay that can take workers above the poverty line without the government's help.
The war on poverty was not just about the poor. President Johnson saw it as a way to "prove the success of our system; to disprove those cynics and critics at home and abroad who question our purpose and our competence."
Our system provides extraordinary rewards for the successful. But as long as so many are left so far behind, the success of our system remains in doubt.
America has not stopped fighting the war on poverty. President Obama's health law should, when functioning properly, prevent medical expenses from dragging many families into bankruptcy.
Yet winning this war will require more than expanded government benefits. It will probably require a different sort of labor market that provides a better first line of defense. That is a much tougher war to win.
Correction: December 19, 2013, Thursday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The Economic Scene column on Wednesday, about stubbornly high poverty rates in the United States despite decades of policies aimed at lifting the poor, misstated part of the name of an economic policy research group at the Brookings Institution. It is the Hamilton Project, not the Hamilton Center.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The beginning of the end probably will not come on Wednesday, but it is coming soon. The Federal Reserve has made clear that its bond-buying campaign will not continue at the present pace for much longer.
Almost from the outset of the campaign last fall, some Fed officials have expressed doubts about the economic benefits and concern about the consequences of a deepening commitment to a relatively untested approach to monetary policy.
So far, the realities of high unemployment and slow growth have outweighed those misgivings, and the Fed has continued to expand, by $85 billion a month, its holdings of Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities. Analysts generally expect the Fed's policy-making committee, which meets on Tuesday and Wednesday, to once again defer any changes in the program, although a spate of stronger economic news has increased the odds of a policy shift.
Even among Fed officials who support the bond-buying program, however, there is general agreement that the Fed should taper off on its bond buying and focus on stimulating the economy by other means. It's just a matter of timing.
The broad outlines of the shift also are clear. The Fed intends to lean even more heavily on "forward guidance," trying to hold down borrowing costs for businesses and consumers by declaring its intent to keep short-term interest rates near zero.
"We have sought to ease financial conditions further and provide additional impetus to the recovery," Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, said Monday at a celebration of the Fed's 100th anniversary, "by communicating, both quantitatively about the likely future path of our policy rate and qualitatively about the likely evolution of our balance sheet."
The event, a rare break from the Fed's general practice of avoiding public comment in the days before a policy meeting, was held as a matter of convenience because so many Fed officials were already planning to be in Washington this week. The actual anniversary is Dec. 23. Attendees included the former Fed chairmen Alan Greenspan and Paul A. Volcker, along with Janet L. Yellen, who is expected to be confirmed by the Senate this week to lead the Fed for the next four years.
Fed officials say that the impending shift reflects the progress of the economic recovery, and that it could improve the effectiveness of forward guidance by focusing public attention on a single stimulus program.
But there are plenty of skeptics. Stanley Fischer, the former governor of the Bank of Israel and leading candidate to be nominated by President Obama as the next vice chairman of the Fed, has suggested in recent public remarks that the power of forward guidance is constrained because the future is unpredictable, so investors will correctly discount the Fed's forecasts.
Adam S. Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, has advanced a similar critique, arguing that bond buying is a more effective form of stimulus than forward guidance, and that investors are more likely to take the Fed seriously when it acts, not just talks.
Mr. Bernanke and his allies say that bond buying will soon have served its purpose. While academics have struggled to isolate the effects of the campaign, officials assert that it has helped to lower a wide range of borrowing costs, leading to increased sales of cars and other consumer goods, and contributing to a modest climb in job creation.
Some Fed officials argue that these benefits have begun to diminish. Moreover, on a technical level, bond buying has stronger effects when financial markets are in disarray.
"The bottom line is that diminishing returns will eventually affect any bond purchase strategy, whatever its design and initial effects," the International Monetary Fund concluded in an analysis published in April. "Policy makers most likely need to either accept this diminishing impact or adopt new and more radical policy frameworks over time."
But there is no consensus inside the Fed that the benefits of the bond buying, often referred to as "quantitative easing," are wearing off.
"I don't buy this diminishing returns thing," James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, said in an interview with Bloomberg Television last month. "If you lowered the funds rate from 5 percent to 4 percent, and then you lowered it from 4 percent to 3 percent, you probably wouldn't say that the second hundred basis points was less effective than the first 100 basis points. And I don't think we should say that about the Q.E. program either."
Officials are also not particularly afraid of inflation. While some Fed officials worry about the risk that buying bonds will lead to faster inflation, the Fed, if anything, is increasingly confronting the opposite problem. Several Fed officials in recent weeks have expressed puzzlement over why prices have been rising at an unusually sluggish pace.
There is another technical issue. Lower federal deficits have reduced the issuance of government debt, so the Fed is buying a growing share. And as higher interest rates have reduced the demand for mortgage loans, the Fed is buying a larger share of government-backed mortgage bonds, too.
"The best argument for tapering sooner rather than later?" Peter R. Fisher, senior director at the BlackRock Investment Institute, wrote in a recent analysis. "The Fed is running out of stuff to buy." He estimated that if it maintained the current level of asset purchases, the Fed could soon be consuming all the new issuance of Treasuries and mortgage bonds.
But the most important risk associated with bond buying is also the most fundamental. The point of the program is to encourage risk-taking by business executives and investors, but one of the Fed's main concerns is to avoid encouraging too much risk-taking. For now, there is a greater risk to worry about: that the economy could slip back toward recession if the Fed fails to do enough to encourage growth.
As the economy shows signs of improving health, however, the Fed is reverting to its most basic fear: that it will do too much.

Full text:   FRANKFURT -- The decision by Jörg Asmussen to leave the European Central Bank will deprive the policy-setting body of a financial expert who had helped sell its policies to a skeptical German public, despite his occasional disagreements with Mario Draghi, the bank's president.
But Mr. Asmussen's departure -- to take a job with Chancellor Angela Merkel's new government in Berlin -- opens the door for the appointment of a woman to the otherwise all-male top echelon of monetary decision-making in the euro zone.
Berlin is likely to nominate Sabine Lautenschläger, a member of the executive board of the Bundesbank, the German central bank, as Mr. Asmussen's successor, according to German press reports. The reports were confirmed by a person with knowledge of the discussions, who was not authorized to speak about the appointment publicly.
Over the weekend, German news media reported that Mr. Asmussen would become a deputy secretary in the German Labor Ministry. The job is markedly less influential than his current position as a member of the executive board of the central bank. However, Mr. Asmussen said that he wanted to be closer to his family, who continued to live in Berlin after he joined the bank in Frankfurt at the start of 2012.
"The seat of the E.C.B. in Frankfurt with my family with my two very young children in Berlin were not compatible over the long term," Mr. Asmussen, 47, said in a statement. "There are no other reasons for this step."
Ms. Lautenschläger, an expert on banking regulation, has not made her views on monetary policy known. But it would be surprising if she deviated much from Bundesbank doctrine, which Mr. Asmussen has also espoused and which emphasizes the European Central Bank's duty to fight inflation.
Ms. Lautenschläger could be nominated by Ms. Merkel by the end of the week. Her appointment would require the approval of leaders of other European governments, as well as the European Parliament -- a process that would probably last until February. The E.C.B. Governing Council, which includes the six-member executive board and the heads of the 17 central banks in the euro zone, has not had a female member since Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell left the executive board at the end of her term in 2011.
Mr. Asmussen often helped communicate policy to Germans fearful that the E.C.B. was a conduit for transferring their wealth to stricken countries like Greece. In contrast to much of the German economics establishment, Mr. Asmussen was publicly supportive of bank measures to subdue the euro zone crisis that were unpopular in Germany.
He defended central bank policies in testimony to Germany's highest court in June after citizens' groups challenged their constitutionality. He presented a counterweight to officials like Jens Weidmann, president of the Bundesbank, who were highly critical of the E.C.B. The court has not yet ruled on the legal challenge.
Mr. Asmussen joined the bank board after his predecessor, Jürgen Stark, resigned because of his dismay over central bank bond-buying, which he and other German economists regard as a violation of a prohibition against central bank financing of governments. Mr. Asmussen's more moderate views helped prevent Germany, the euro zone's largest country, from becoming completely alienated from the bank.
Ms. Lautenschläger's expertise in banking regulation could be useful as the E.C.B. prepares to assume its role late next year as the top bank overseer for the euro zone. But her nomination could also invite criticism that she has not been tough enough on German banks.
Ms. Lautenschläger has been reluctant to impose stricter limits on banks' use of borrowed money to conduct business, a position that has put her at odds with United States regulators in debates about international bank standards.
The Bundesbank declined to comment on whether Ms. Lautenschläger would replace Mr. Asmussen.
Mr. Asmussen's new job in Berlin is, at least on paper, less important than the job he held before joining the E.C.B. Then, he was a deputy secretary in the Finance Ministry and one of the lead German representatives in European efforts to control the euro zone crisis at its height from 2010 to 2012.
In his new position under Labor Minister Andrea Nahles, Mr. Asmussen will oversee the introduction of a national minimum wage. The Social Democrats made the minimum wage one of their demands in negotiations to form a government with Ms. Merkel's Christian Democrats.
If Mr. Asmussen, a Social Democrat, is able to manage the transition to a minimum wage, he could position himself for a cabinet post in the future.
Though Mr. Asmussen avoided public dissent as a member of the E.C.B. board, there were occasional signs of tension between him and Mr. Draghi, the bank's president.
Early this year, Mr. Asmussen represented the bank in talks with the European Commission and the International Monetary Fund over aid to Cyprus, a member of the euro zone. They worked out a plan that would have forced depositors to finance much of a bailout of the country's banks. After an outcry, they revised the plan. Mr. Draghi later called the plan "not smart," an implicit rebuke to Mr. Asmussen.
In a statement late Sunday, Mr. Draghi said that Mr. Asmussen "has been a tremendous help in shaping the monetary policy in the past two years while successfully addressing many other challenges." He added, "I will personally miss him."

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDEDIF you've only recently tuned in to the seemingly endless conversation about bitcoin, you could be forgiven for thinking that the digital currency is little more than the latest Wall Street fetish or a juiced-up version of PayPal. After all, so many headlines in the last few weeks have focused on its market price and the cool stuff you can get with it: Bitcoin breaks $1,000! Bitcoin plunges by a half! Bitcoin has a banner Black Friday! Use bitcoin to buy a ride on Richard Branson's starship!
But all the talk about bitcoin's value (or lack thereof) obscures the fact that it was never really meant as an investment nor primarily as a way to purchase sex toys or alpaca socks -- let alone a brand-new Lamborghini. One could argue that bitcoin isn't chiefly a commercial venture at all, a funny thing to say about a kind of online cash. To its creators and numerous disciples, bitcoin is -- and always has been -- a mostly ideological undertaking, more philosophy than finance.
"The ideas behind it -- that's what attracted me," said Elizabeth Ploshay, a regular writer for Bitcoin magazine, which describes its mission as being "the most accurate and up-to-date source of information, news and commentary about bitcoin." And if the magazine has a mission, so, too, does the subject that it covers. As Ms. Ploshay explained it, bitcoin isn't merely money; it's "a movement" -- a crusade in the costume of a currency. Depending on whom you talk to, the goal is to unleash repressed economies, to take down global banking or to wage a war against the Federal Reserve.
For those with an uncertain understanding of its history, bitcoin entered the world on Jan. 3, 2009, when a shadowy hacker -- or team of hackers -- working under the name Satoshi Nakamoto released an ingenious string of computer code that established a system permitting people to transfer money to one another online, directly, anonymously and outside government control, in much the way that Napster once allowed the unrestrained transfer of music files. In a 500-word essay that accompanied the code, Nakamoto suggested that the motive for creating bitcoin was anger at the financial crisis: "The root problem with conventional currencies is all the trust that's required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust."
It was fundamentally a political document and, as such, it attracted followers among libertarian and anarchist groups who saw in bitcoin a means of removing the money supply from the grasping hands of government. In blog posts and at bitcoin conferences around the globe, these evangelists began to spread its gospel. It is only in the last few months, as bitcoin has attracted the attention of political parties, regulators and speculative investors that the narrative of bitcoin as a tool for change has been drowned out by a simpler story line: that of bitcoin as a kind of crypto-credit card -- or, even more, as a digitized casino game.
"Price is the least interesting thing about bitcoin," said Roger Ver, an early investor who is often called, in a typical movement phrase, the Bitcoin Jesus. "At first, almost everyone who got involved did so for philosophical reasons. We saw bitcoin as a great idea, as a way to separate money from the state."
While the bitcoin hype has inspired Ron Paulian dreams of evading inflation and undermining the Federal Reserve, the currency has also gained cachet among less conspicuously conservative adherents, like the founders of BitPesa, a start-up firm in Nairobi, Kenya, that plans to help Africans abroad send money to their families at home. According to the World Bank, $1.3 billion in remittances is sent each year to Kenya, a process that costs about $110 million in fees. By using bitcoin's peer-to-peer technology to avoid banks and wire-transfer companies like Western Union, BitPesa hopes to reduce these fees by two-thirds, saving ordinary Africans $74 million annually.
You know you're talking to a true bitcoin believer if you hear the word "disruption." But that's how bitcoin is seen within the broader movement: as an unruly tool with potentially transformative effects on entrenched businesses like retail payment and asset management.
"Right now in the United States, bitcoin is mainly considered a get-rich-quick scheme with a little financial privacy thrown in," said Jon Matonis, the executive director of the Bitcoin Foundation, the self-proclaimed center of the decentralized crusade. "But its larger implications down the road are major disruptions to certain legacy industries."
Mr. Matonis added that the ideology of bitcoin was wide enough to accommodate people on all points on the spectrum -- "from libertarian capitalists to socialists." It not only has a following among the anti-central bank crowd, he said; it has also proved attractive to communitarians like the residents of the Kreuzberg neighborhood in Berlin, which now boasts the highest density of businesses accepting bitcoin in the world.
There are even those who see bitcoin as the ultimate alternative to the global banking system. Ryan Singer, a co-founder of the bitcoin exchange Tradehill, based in San Francisco, compared the currency to email, conjecturing that it would gradually supplant traditional banking, just as digital messaging displaced handwritten letters. "When kids wake up to the fact that they don't need their parents' help to create a bitcoin wallet," Mr. Singer said, "when they can use bitcoins for free international transactions, at any hour, in every major city on the planet, then you'll know that something has changed."
Perhaps the best proof of bitcoin's ideological underpinnings is that a schism has emerged in recent weeks between moderate elements in the movement who sense the necessity of cooperating with officialdom, and a more uncompromising faction that wants to keep bitcoin free from any government regulation. The hard-line bloc is exemplified by the crypto-anarchist developers of a bitcoin product called Dark Wallet, which is scheduled to be introduced next year and will include extra protections to ensure that bitcoin transactions remain secure, anonymous and difficult to trace.
"We see this as part of the total sublation of the state," said Cody Wilson, Dark Wallet's director, who gained fame earlier this year when he published online the blueprints to a pistol that could be manufactured with a 3-D printer. "I know I sound like some kind of weird Jehovah's Witness, but we've only just begun. We admit that we are ideologues."
Correction: January 5, 2014, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A news analysis article on Dec. 15 about the ideology behind bitcoin, the digital currency, misstated the percentage of banking fees that BitPesa -- a firm in Nairobi, Kenya, that seeks to help Africans abroad send money to their families at home -- wants to save its customers using bitcoin technology. The company seeks to reduce by two-thirds, not one-third, the $110 million in annual fees currently being paid, for savings of $74 million a year.

Abstract: "There is a recognition that if we don't invest in modernizing airport infrastructure and air traffic control systems, we are likely to return to congestion that plagued travel five years ago," said Deborah C. McElroy, the interim president for Airports Council International-North America, an airport industry trade group that represents the nation's commercial airports.

Full text:   Two new studies have found that rough days may be ahead for air travel congestion.
Air travel infrastructure in the United States is in such bad shape that the average day at the nation's airports might resemble the busiest travel days of the year at nearly all of the top 50 American airports within the decade, according to the studies.
The studies, recently released by the U.S. Travel Association, a trade group, and the Eno Center for Transportation, a think tank, arrived at a similar conclusion: Many United States airports are already operating at or near capacity, and current air travel growth trajectories threaten to overwhelm the nation's aviation infrastructure and harm the United States economy.
"Long lines, hassle, congestion -- that's what inadequate infrastructure means to travelers," Erik Hansen, the director of domestic policy at U.S. Travel, said in a telephone interview. One way to improve efficiency at airports would be to raise the airport passenger facility charge to $8.50 from the current $4.50 to provide airports with additional revenue for investment to be consistent with inflation, he said.
U.S. Travel's study focused on the top 30 airports, which accounted for 70 percent of total passenger "enplanements" in 2012. The Eno Center study, which was funded in part by U.S. Travel, examined the current infrastructure at six major airports and the economic impact of inadequate investment.
"There is a recognition that if we don't invest in modernizing airport infrastructure and air traffic control systems, we are likely to return to congestion that plagued travel five years ago," said Deborah C. McElroy, the interim president for Airports Council International-North America, an airport industry trade group that represents the nation's commercial airports. Not addressing the issue "is going to have significant impact not just on passengers, but on the entire travel industry," she said. The council is a member of U.S. Travel, but was not involved in its study.
Roger Dow, the president and chief executive of U.S. Travel, said that frequent global travelers were aware of how streamlined airports are in many places in the world and worried that serious delays at American airports and failing to keep pace would inhibit domestic and international travel in the United States. "Right now, my car has better technology than what air traffic controllers are using," he said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

An Unexpectedly Big Tax Bite for Top Earners This Year

Abstract: (The law applies the surtax to the lower of either the modified adjusted gross income or net investment income.) Itemized deductions will be reduced for individuals earning more than $250,000 and couples earning more than $300,000 a year. In figuring this out, the traditional planning techniques of accelerating or delaying income, deductions and state taxes can keep your income from cracking one of the income levels that will increase your tax bill.

Full text:   LESS than a year ago, people were worried about a variety of tax increases in 2013, from income and investment taxes going up to the exemption on estate and gift taxes going down. This year, without any last-minute negotiation around major tax policy, people are far less focused on taxes, and that has accountants and tax lawyers worried.
"A lot of individual taxpayers are in for a huge shock when they file their taxes," said Brittney Saks, United States personal financial services leader for PricewaterhouseCoopers. "If you had the exact same income in 2012 and 2013, your taxes can be significantly different."
She noted that income and capital gains tax rates had risen, a new Medicare tax on wages and investment earnings was introduced, and itemized deductions had been reduced for high earners. These changes generally affect the top 5 percent of earners, but that group could find itself with a tax bill 10 percent higher than last year, all other things being equal, she said.
Joe Perry, partner in charge of tax and business services at Marcum, took his analysis a step further. He looked at his firm's 1,200 individual clients who made more than $400,000 a year -- the threshold for all the highest rates, new taxes and reduced deductions to kick in. He calculated that they were looking at paying 7 percent more this year, but then he translated that into a real number: It equated to $250 million more.
"People will focus on the percentages until they see what that dollar amount is and then they're going to be shocked," Mr. Perry said.
While most of these clients have been paying estimated taxes throughout the year, most have been paying the minimum to avoid incurring a penalty, he said. Like other accountants, he is concerned that come tax day these people are going to have a bill that will not just shock them but may cause some to scramble to come up with the money.
In other words, 2013 should be a more stressful time for tax planning than it has been.
There are several planning considerations for people, particularly those on the cusp of various tax increases and deduction limitations.
The biggest is to understand how the new Medicare taxes are going to affect them. But several popular deductions are also set to end, and there are lingering opportunities with the new estate and gift tax exemption.
First things first: People need to understand what their tax risks are as they move up the income ladder. Individuals earning more than $200,000 a year and couples earning more than $250,000 are subject to a 0.9 percent Medicare tax on their wages; those are the same income levels for the 3.8 percent Medicare tax on investment income. (The law applies the surtax to the lower of either the modified adjusted gross income or net investment income.)
Itemized deductions will be reduced for individuals earning more than $250,000 and couples earning more than $300,000 a year. People making more than $400,000 a year and couples making over $450,000 will face the highest marginal taxes on income (39.6 percent) and capital gains (20 percent) in addition to the 3.8 percent Medicare surtax. At that point, taxpayers even lose their personal exemption -- the $3,900 deduction people and their dependents get just for being alive.
"The calculations are getting more complicated," said Monica Rebella, a certified public accountant in Southern California. "It's going to be small things that get people."
For example, losing the personal exemption for a family of four means $15,600 in deductions just disappeared, she said.
The first thing people need to do is assess where they are on the ladder of tax increases. In figuring this out, the traditional planning techniques of accelerating or delaying income, deductions and state taxes can keep your income from cracking one of the income levels that will increase your tax bill.
But there are several things people can't control. Ms. Rebella pointed out that take-home pay has already gone down for people who have earned $200,000 to date. That is because companies are required to start withholding the 0.9 percent Medicare tax above that amount.
This should be straightforward, but it has at least two complications. If those people are married and their spouse's income does not put them over the $250,000 threshold, they should not have to pay the tax. But since it is a Medicare tax and not an income tax, Ms. Rebella worried that the systems set up to calculate the two different taxes may not work together and the refund will be lost.
The second issue is if the other spouse earned, say, $180,000, which would put the couple well over the $250,000 limit. Because the 0.9 percent tax would not have been withheld from that spouse's income, the couple will end up owing more.
Beneficiaries of a trust could also find themselves unexpectedly thrust over one of the income thresholds. The reason is that trust earnings are taxed higher at lower amounts: $11,950 of income will set off the highest rate.
Mary Kay Foss, a certified public accountant with Sweeney Kovar, gave the example of a trust with $12,000 in capital gains and $10,000 in dividend income for the year. The trustee might distribute that $10,000 to the beneficiary, which would be good for the trust but could push the beneficiary over the threshold for higher taxes.
Her advice is simple: Contact the trustee, so you can plan accordingly.
Planning is not so easy for people who receive passive income -- say, distributions from a family company or rental income on properties that someone else maintains. This income is subject to the 3.8 percent surtax, unless people can show they are actively involved in the business.
This is even trickier with a family business, where, say, the daughter is running the company and her brother is not involved. Her distribution of profits would not be subject to the 3.8 percent surtax, but his would be, Ms. Foss said.
With real estate, there may be more wiggle room, despite clear requirements on what counts as involvement. "If you have a full-time job and are renting these properties out, you probably can't claim them," Mr. Perry said. "But your spouse might be able to, and it makes a difference this year."
On assets subject to the 3.8 percent tax, like real estate that needs work, there is an opportunity to apply deductions to the income from them. But so far the Internal Revenue Service has not offered guidance beyond saying the deductions need to be reasonable -- wording that will no doubt encourage some to push the boundaries of reason.
One bright spot on income taxes: Unlike past years, the alternative minimum tax is not in flux, so calculating it is, at least, easier. The downside is that the calculation is always to determine which tax is higher.
Another bright spot is that even though 57 provisions are set to expire this year if they are not extended before year-end, the expiration of only a few of them will have a broad impact on individuals.
One is the ability to give a required distribution from a retirement account directly to charity -- saving the donor from having to declare it as income, which could put him in a higher tax bracket. Accountants were divided between assuming the provision would be reinstated and believing it wouldn't matter if it wasn't.
"I've advised my clients to ignore that expiration date," Ms. Foss said. "They're not going to be that bad off if it does expire, and they're going to give that much to charity anyway."
Another is the ability of taxpayers filing in a state without an income tax, like Florida, to deduct state and local sales tax on their federal returns.
People could do additional estate planning this year and possibly save a lot in future taxes. With the exemption indexed to inflation, a couple can now give as a gift $10.5 million, or $260,000 more than last year. But lawyers acknowledged that few people were ready for more planning after the rush to get gifts done last year, when they feared that the exemption would be reduced and the tax increased.
"There's a little fatigue over planning and giving things away and filing tax returns," said Michael J. Puzo, a partner at Hemenway & Barnes. "It's like the dentist telling you to floss your teeth. You know there is harm in not doing it, but you don't see the immediate catalyst for doing it."
The same could be said for a lot of this year's tax planning -- until the higher bill arrives.

Full text:   The pundit consensus seems to be that Republicans lost in the just-concluded budget deal. Overall spending will be a bit higher than the level mandated by the sequester, the straitjacket imposed back in 2011. Meanwhile, Democrats avoided making any concessions on Social Security or Medicare. Call this one for Team D, I guess.
But if Republicans arguably lost this round, the unemployed lost even more: Extended benefits weren't renewed, so 1.3 million workers will be cut off at the end of this month, and many more will see their benefits run out in the months that follow. And if you take a longer perspective -- if you look at what has happened since Republicans took control of the House of Representatives in 2010 -- what you see is a triumph of anti-government ideology that has had enormously destructive effects on American workers.
First, some facts about government spending.
One of the truly remarkable things about American political discourse at the end of 2013 is the fixed conviction among many conservatives that the Obama era has been one of enormous growth in government. Where do they think this surge in government spending has taken place? Well, it's true that one major new program -- the Affordable Care Act -- is going into effect. But it's not nearly as big as people imagine. Once Obamacare is fully implemented, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that it will add only about 3 percent to overall federal spending. And, if you ask people ranting about runaway government what other programs they're talking about, you draw a blank.
Meanwhile, the actual numbers show that over the past three years we've been living through an era of unprecedented government downsizing. Government employment is down sharply; so is total government spending (including state and local governments) adjusted for inflation, which has fallen almost 3 percent since 2010 and around 5 percent per capita.
And when I say unprecedented, I mean just that. We haven't seen anything like the recent government cutbacks since the 1950s, and probably since the demobilization that followed World War II.
What has been cut? It's a complex picture, but the most obvious cuts have been in education, infrastructure, research, and conservation. While the Recovery Act (the Obama stimulus) was in effect, the federal government provided significant aid to state and local education. Then the aid went away, and local governments began letting go of hundreds of thousands of teachers.
Meanwhile, public investment fell sharply -- so sharply that many observers refer to it as a "collapse" -- as state and local governments canceled transportation projects and deferred maintenance. Researchers, like those at the National Institutes of Health, also took large cuts. And there was a major cut in spending on land and water conservation.
There are three things you need to know about these harsh cuts.
First, they were unnecessary. The Washington establishment may have hyperventilated about debt and deficits, but markets have never shown any concern at all about U.S. creditworthiness. In fact, borrowing costs have stayed at near-record lows throughout.
Second, the cuts did huge short-term economic damage. Small-government advocates like to claim that reducing government spending encourages private spending -- and when the economy is booming, they have a point. The recent cuts, however, took place at the worst possible moment, the aftermath of a financial crisis. Families were struggling to cope with the debt they had run up during the housing bubble; businesses were reluctant to invest given the weakness of consumer demand. Under these conditions, government cutbacks simply swelled the ranks of the unemployed -- and as family incomes fell, so did consumer spending, compounding the damage.
The result was to deepen and prolong America's jobs crisis. Those cuts in government spending are the main reason we still have high unemployment, more than five years after Lehman Brothers fell.
Finally, if you look at my list of major areas that were cut, you'll notice that they mainly involve investing in the future. So we aren't just looking at short-term harm, we're also looking at a long-term degradation of our prospects, reinforced by the corrosive effects of sustained high unemployment.
So, about that budget deal: yes, it was a small victory for Democrats. It was also, possibly, a small step toward political sanity, with some Republicans rejecting, provisionally, the notion that a party controlling neither the White House nor the Senate can nonetheless get whatever it wants through extortion.
But the larger picture is one of years of deeply destructive policy, imposing gratuitous suffering on working Americans. And this deal didn't do much to change that picture.

Abstract: [...]could the minimum wage play a significant role in mitigating poverty and, perhaps, slowing the widening gap in American incomes? The minimum wage can complement the earned-income tax credit, which can depress wages because it creates new incentives to work, increasing the supply of workers who will accept a low wage.

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDEDSenator Ted Kennedy once called the minimum wage "one of the best" tools for fighting poverty.
But the fact is, the minimum wage's anti-poverty powers have been declining steadily for decades. In the late 1960s, a full-time job at minimum wage could almost lift a family of four above the poverty line. By the late '80s, it left them 40 percent below it. That is about where things stand today.
Perhaps it is no wonder, then, that the minimum wage is in the spotlight. Low-paid workers across the nation are pressing for a raise. Fast-food workers in particular -- many of whom earn little more than the $7.25 an hour federal minimum -- are pushing for $15. Senate Democrats want to raise the minimum to $10.10 over three years.
At the center of the debate is economic inequality, which has reached levels not seen since the Gilded Age. Poverty is at a two-decade high. The share of poor working-age Americans is the highest since at least 1967, according to a new study by researchers at Columbia University.
This sobering reality raises two questions. First, can the minimum wage be raised significantly without prompting employers to dump workers, close franchises and replace cashiers with computers? Second, could the minimum wage play a significant role in mitigating poverty and, perhaps, slowing the widening gap in American incomes?
Neither has an easy answer. Perhaps the most compelling argument for raising the minimum wage is simply this: It is worth a try. It might not be the most effective tool to raise the incomes of the working poor. But given the erosion of collective bargaining and the absence of other labor market regulations, it is one of the few we have.
Economists disagree about whether raising the wage will cost some workers their jobs. A poll this year found top economists about evenly divided on whether a $9 minimum would make it noticeably harder for low-skilled workers to find a job.
And some question whether a higher minimum would really help the poor over all, since some workers would keep their jobs while others would lose them.
"It's kind of a wash," said David Neumark of the University of California, Irvine. "The hit to losers wipes out the gains for winners." He said the earned-income tax credit has proved much more effective at relieving poverty among families and, especially, children.
Back in the '80s, President Ronald Reagan's top economists argued that the minimum wage was a job killer. In 2001, Alan Greenspan, who had been appointed Federal Reserve chairman by Mr. Reagan, told a congressional hearing: "I'm not in favor of cutting anybody's earnings or preventing them from rising, but I am against them losing their jobs because of artificial government intervention, which is essentially what the minimum wage is."
In an interview more than 10 years ago with Rick Wartzman, my former colleague at The Wall Street Journal who now runs the Drucker Institute at Claremont Graduate University, Murray Weidenbaum, the chairman of Mr. Reagan's first Council of Economic Advisers, said of the minimum wage: "If we would have had our druthers, we would have eliminated it."
The Reagan administration didn't abolish it. The political cost would have been too high. Instead, it let inflation turn it, in Mr. Weidenbaum's words, into "an effective dead letter."
By the time the Reagan years were over, the minimum wage was worth less than two-thirds of its peak value. Nonetheless, the real poverty rate -- after taking into account other government transfers to the poor -- was lower than it had been during the minimum wage's heyday in 1968.
For all the resistance, there is a compelling case that the minimum wage should probably rise -- and not because that would sharply reduce poverty. It is because the United States has little else to support the working poor.
The drawbacks are probably not as dire as critics have charged. Recent research, based on the experience of 11 states that have imposed their own, higher rates, suggests that a modest increase to the minimum wage has little or no adverse impact on employment.
The minimum wage can complement the earned-income tax credit, which can depress wages because it creates new incentives to work, increasing the supply of workers who will accept a low wage. And it reaches parts of the population that the tax credit does not touch, like many poor men and women without children -- who would welcome a chance to work their way out of poverty.
New research suggests that the minimum wage may in fact slightly reduce poverty. Arindrajit Dube of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, estimates that a 10 percent increase in the minimum wage would reduce the poverty rate by about 2 percent and increase the income of people near poverty by about 2 to 3 percent.
It might even slow the widening income gap. Some scholars have concluded that while the decline of the minimum wage was probably not the main cause of growing inequality since the 1980s, it did play a role in widening parts of the income gap.
These effects are, admittedly, not enormous. But they are gains. And they are more than the labor market has been able to deliver.
Notably, arguments that more education will -- on its own -- improve the lot of workers at the bottom are belied by the fact that low-wage workers today are more educated than they have ever been.
The United States might not even need a minimum wage if it had some of the institutions that other advanced nations use to put a floor on workers' living standards. But it doesn't.
At the end of the day, it is true that the United States and its flexible labor markets produce more fast-food employment than those of other rich nations.
McDonald's has one restaurant for every 22,000 Americans yet only one for every 42,000 Swedes. Americans' unbridled love of burgers and fries, of course, plays an important role. But another reason is pay: Swedish burger flippers earn more than their American counterparts. That means the prices of burgers are more affordable to the average American than to the average Swede.
"The smallness of the share of the low-skill, labor-intensive private service sector in many European countries relative to that in the United States is at least to some extent due to their higher price of low-skilled labor," wrote the economists Robert Lipsey from the National Bureau of Economic Research, now deceased, and Birgitta Swedenborg of the Center for Business and Policy Studies in Stockholm, in a study a few years ago about the price disparities. "Their high prices inhibit not only the consumption of these services, but also their production and their employment of low-skill workers."
Keep two facts in mind. First, millions of fast-food jobs are not indispensable for prosperity. Sweden may have fewer McDonald's outlets than the United States, but almost twice the share of Americans live in poverty.
And second, the floor can be raised without a minimum wage. Sweden, in fact, doesn't have one. But it does have other tools -- like a 70 percent unionization rate. In the United States, the union membership rate is the private sector is about 7 percent.
Correction: December 12, 2013, Thursday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The Economic Scene column on Wednesday, about raising the minimum wage as a step toward easing poverty, misstated the rate of union membership in the United States. The membership rate is 11.3 percent, not 7 percent. (The union membership rate among private sector workers is 7 percent.)

Full text:   AFTER almost six weeks of budget negotiations uncharacteristically devoid of histrionics and dire threats, a House-Senate conference committee gave birth Tuesday night -- but only to a mouse.
How wonderful it would have been for our elected officials to have had a major fiscal success to show for more than two years of stalemates, shutdowns and all-around silliness.
Even the most significant budget showdown, in November 2011, produced absolutely nothing, even though those deliberations occurred at the point of a gun, the impending forced spending cuts known as sequester.
This time around, legislators didn't face similar consequences for inaction. So while we urgently need to reverse the federal government's crazily backward fiscal policy and address long-term deficits, the agreement accomplishes neither.
Instead, we get a modest amount of additional spending (calculated to be more than offset by various other tweaks), because of an unusual consensus among party leaders on both sides that the most extreme consequences of the sequester needed to be amended.
The economically destructive squeeze has been so severe that even Representative Hal Rogers, the Republican chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, issued a statement last summer saying that "sequestration -- and its unrealistic and ill-conceived discretionary cuts -- must be brought to an end."
But congressional willpower does not appear to extend to shelving the sequester. Nor does Congress evince any interest in executing the needed fundamental reform of our fiscal policy.
Indeed, the new agreement would extend over two years, most likely delaying any possibility of more substantial, sensible long-term changes.
The partial cancellation of 2014 and 2015 sequester cuts won't make a significant difference to the larger budget picture. In nearly four years of budget wars, Congress restructured the nation's finances in ways precisely the opposite of what should have been pursued.
We've irresponsibly slashed spending on important domestic needs while doing nothing of significance to address longer-term debt projections that remain scarily large.
Over the past two years, outlays on domestic programs have fallen from $514 billion to $469 billion, a hefty 8.8 percent reduction -- and that's before adjusting for inflation. Those cuts were imposed across the board, an indiscriminate meat ax that did not spare crucial areas of investment ranging from research to airports to education.
If we are serious about an economic growth agenda, we should be increasing spending in these areas from pre-sequester levels. The new deal doesn't do that.
Meanwhile, the impetus for more fundamental fiscal reforms has been derailed by the sharp decline in the deficit -- from $1.4 trillion in fiscal year 2009 to $680 billion in fiscal year 2013 -- as well as an improving longer-term budget outlook.
According to projections by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, the nation's 2023 debt picture has improved by almost $1 trillion since February, as a result of a variety of factors, including higher revenue collections and slowing health care costs.
Consequently, many progressives have renounced any need for fiscal reform. Some have called for increased deficit spending to shake our sluggish economy, and others have argued for expanding programs like Social Security.
I'm sympathetic to the notion that we've brought the deficit down too fast. The declining deficit meant that the federal government caused the gross domestic product to grow by an estimated 1.5 percentage points fewer this year than it would have, had the deficit remained constant.
Nonetheless, the longer-term problem remains. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget forecasts that the ratio of publicly held debt to G.D.P. -- a key measure of fiscal health -- would rise to 99 percent by 2035, from 73 percent now, if Congress rolled back the rest of the untenable forced sequester cuts.
That may be too rosy a picture. The Congressional Budget Office assumes robust growth over the coming decade -- not a single year of recession and three annual G.D.P. increases of about 4 percent beginning in 2015. (By comparison, the G.D.P. is likely to grow by just 1.7 percent this year.) Slower growth means a higher debt-to-G.D.P. ratio.
The long-term steps that are needed are, by now, familiar. To support an aging population, revenues must be raised; closing loopholes can help but is unlikely to be sufficient. The finances of Medicare and Social Security need to be put on an actuarially sound basis.
To date, neither party has been willing to offer a comprehensive and balanced plan. While the Obama administration has come closest, with a 10-year plan that would reduce the deficit by $1.8 trillion -- and that includes meaningful Social Security reforms -- it has been unwilling or unable to advance its agenda.
Perhaps even offering a reminder of the need for these steps is naïve, in this politically fractious environment. But unless we come to grips with the fiscal issue, we will be inflicting a huge financial burden on our children.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The wealth of Americans reached a nominal record high during the summer, buoyed by surging stock prices and a healthy recovery in home values.
The Federal Reserve said on Monday that household net worth in the United States rose 2.6 percent, to $77.3 trillion, from July through September. Net worth reflects the value of homes, stocks, bank accounts and other assets minus mortgages, credit cards and other debts.
Rising stock prices increased the overall net worth of Americans by $917 billion. Higher home values added $428 billion.
The increase in net worth is an encouraging sign for the economy. As Americans gain wealth, they typically spend more, and that drives faster growth.
The report also showed that Americans were willing to borrow more in the third quarter. That suggests many are growing more confident in their jobs and the broader economy.
Adjusted for inflation, though, net worth is still about 1 percent below its prerecession peak. But both the stock market and home prices have continued to increase in the fourth quarter. That is likely to push inflation-adjusted household wealth to a record.
Still, the gains have not been equally distributed. The wealthiest 10 percent of households own about 80 percent of the stocks. And homeownership has declined since the recession, particularly among lower-income Americans.
Total mortgage debt rose 0.9 percent from the previous quarter. That is the first increase since early 2009. The rise reflects growing home sales and fewer mortgage defaults.
Americans are also holding more consumer debt besides mortgages, in the form of student loans, auto loans and credit cards. Consumer debt rose 6 percent from the previous quarter.
But with the job market showing some signs of improvement and wages rising gradually, Americans appear able to handle the additional borrowing.
Total after-tax income is rising faster than borrowing. That has pushed debts, as a percentage of income, to 99 percent. Before the recession, that ratio had peaked at about 125 percent.
Paul Edelstein, an economist at IHS Global Insight, said that improving household finances could make Americans more willing to spend.
But much of that spending could hinge on consumers' willingness to continue borrowing. If Americans become hesitant to take on more debt, it could mean that the improvement in their finances will not necessarily lead to further sizable gains in spending.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve officials are in no hurry to retreat from their bond-buying campaign to stimulate the economy and are likely to postpone any cuts to the program until next year, according to public statements by Fed officials and interviews with some of them.
Job growth has strengthened in recent months, and Fed officials expect continued improvement in the coming year. The Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, predicted in June that the Fed would taper its purchases by the end of this year, and officials say they still could announce such a cut next week, when the Fed's policy-making committee is scheduled to hold its final meeting of the year.
But influential Fed officials see little harm in postponing the decision, particularly compared with the risks of pulling back too soon. Significant details of the eventual retreat also remain the subjects of unresolved debates, according to the public statements and interviews. And some officials argue that the slow pace of inflation is itself a reason for the Fed to maintain its stimulus campaign.
"Everything else equal, I would like to see a couple of months of good numbers," Charles L. Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, told Reuters on Friday, referring to the relatively strong jobs numbers in November.
Mr. Evans added that he was "certainly nervous" about the sluggish pace of inflation. Rising prices can help stimulate the economy, making it easier for companies to increase profits and for borrowers to repay debts. Inflation also encourages people and businesses to borrow more money and to spend it more quickly.
Low inflation reduces those incentives. It also means the economy is closer to deflation, or a general decline in prices, which has the opposite effect: freezing economic activity by discouraging both borrowing and spending.
Since January, the Fed has added $85 billion a month to its holdings of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities as part of a broader campaign to reduce borrowing costs for businesses and consumers and encourage risk-taking by investors.
Mr. Bernanke and his allies have repeatedly described the program as a safe and effective way to generate a little more economic activity at a time when the nation's primary economic problem is that millions of Americans cannot find jobs.
Almost from the outset, however, internal and external critics have questioned whether the bond purchases are helping the broader economy or merely enriching investors. And they have warned that the Fed's outsize role in financial markets is disrupting normal activity and may be encouraging excessive speculation.
In the face of those doubts, the Fed has appeared to play for time, repeatedly indicating that it is getting ready to pull back even as a strong majority of its policy-making committee has voted to extend the campaign at each meeting this year.
William C. Dudley, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and a key supporter of the bond purchase program, reflected the caution of this majority in a November speech in which he said, "I have to admit that I am getting more hopeful" given the recent improvement in economic data.
"I hope that this marks a turning point for the economy," Mr. Dudley said. But he continued, "We have seen such bursts in payroll growth before over the past few years and have been disappointed when the pickups proved temporary."
Officials including Mr. Dudley and Janet L. Yellen, the Fed's vice chairwoman -- whom the Senate is likely to confirm as Mr. Bernanke's successor later this month -- see recent job growth as outstripping the moderate pace of economic growth.
"The Yellen/Dudley prescription holds that it will take strong G.D.P. growth to convince them that these employment gains will continue," wrote Vincent Reinhart, a former head of the Fed's monetary policy staff and now the chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley. "We think the committee will use the December meeting to agree on a plan" most likely to be put into effect in March.
Agreeing on a plan also will take some work. The Fed wants to convince investors that tapering would not alter what it views as the centerpiece of its economic stimulus campaign, its commitment to hold short-term interest rates near zero. It has said that it will keep rates near zero at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6.5 percent, and probably quite a bit longer. The rate in November was 7 percent.
When Mr. Bernanke first described the Fed's tapering plans in June, investors ignored this distinction, driving up rates across the board. But the message has gradually taken hold. The movement of asset prices after recent good news, including the November jobs data, has reflected an expectation that the Fed is closer to tapering, but not to raising interest rates. "Markets are beginning to appreciate that they are separate tools," Mr. Bernanke said last month.
Some officials think the Fed still needs to underscore this distinction when it begins to taper its bond purchases. Others now regard such an effort as unnecessary, or contend that the Fed could act after it begins to taper if investors seem to be confused.
Proponents of underscoring the Fed's commitment to low interest rates are further fragmented about the best technique. Some, including Mr. Evans, would like to lower the threshold unemployment rate. Some would like to create a similar threshold for inflation. Some would like to make a symbolic cut in an obscure interest rate the Fed pays on bank reserves.
Instead of such concrete steps, the Fed also could seek to explain in greater detail how it will decide the timetable for increasing interest rates. This option commanded the broadest support at the Fed's meeting in October.
A shift among officials who pushed for tapering earlier in the year has made it easier for the Fed to postpone decisions. Some of those officials now say the Fed should commit to a date to end the program rather than beginning to taper as soon as possible, because they see this as the best way to reduce confusion among investors.
"The sooner we say we're going to end this program once we've purchased X, the sooner we say that, the better," Charles I. Plosser, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, said on Friday. "It's that constant uncertainty about what we'll do at each and every meeting that I think we can eliminate this way, and we'll be better off for it, and we'll not sacrifice much of the benefits of the program."
The sluggish pace of inflation also has made it easier to wait. Prices rose just 0.7 percent during the 12 months that ended in October, the Commerce Department reported on Friday. Excluding the volatile movements of food and energy prices, inflation was still just 1.1 percent over that period. That is significantly below the 2 percent pace the Fed regards as best for the economy.
James Bullard, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, dissented from the Fed's policy statement at the Fed's June meeting because he said that the central bank should signal more strongly its determination to increase the pace of inflation. He said last month that he remained concerned, in part because he did not understand why inflation was falling despite the Fed's enormous stimulus campaign.
"We don't have a good story about why this is," Mr. Bullard said at a Chicago conference. "You would have expected to see more inflation pressure by this point. We haven't seen it. That's what makes me worried more than anything."
The Fed forecasts that inflation will rebound, and investors appear to share that expectation. But some Fed officials, including Mr. Bullard, are reluctant to taper before seeing those expectations edge closer to reality.

Abstract: Opposition leaders had hoped to win a majority of the total votes cast in mayoral races nationwide, but the head of the national electoral commission, Tibisay Lucena, announced that with more than 97 percent of votes transmitted, Mr. Maduro's United Socialist Party had received 44 percent, compared with 41 percent for the main opposition coalition.

Full text:   CARACAS, Venezuela -- Venezuelans went to the polls on Sunday to elect hundreds of mayors around the country in a vote seen as an early test of the fledgling president, Nicolás Maduro, and his ability to carry the country further along the socialist path laid out by his predecessor and mentor, Hugo Chávez.
"It's like a thermometer, to see if the government is doing good or bad," said José de Corral, 60, a schoolteacher who backs the government. He had just come from voting, as shown by the purple ink on his pinkie finger, applied at the polling station as part of a system to keep people from voting more than once. In a country deeply divided between government supporters and opponents, Mr. de Corral said the election would "show who is stronger."
But the results did not show a major shift in the country's political alignment. Opposition leaders had hoped to win a majority of the total votes cast in mayoral races nationwide, but the head of the national electoral commission, Tibisay Lucena, announced that with more than 97 percent of votes transmitted, Mr. Maduro's United Socialist Party had received 44 percent, compared with 41 percent for the main opposition coalition. Other parties, including some allied with the government, received the remainder.
The government party retained control of the largest municipality in Caracas, the capital, while the opposition held on to what is known as the metropolitan mayoralty there, as well as the mayoralty of Maracaibo, the second largest city in Venezuela. The opposition did gain some ground, winning races in Valencia and Barquisimeto, which had been held by the ruling party.
Nine months after Mr. Chávez's death, a struggling economy presented the biggest challenge for the ruling party.
Inflation is 54 percent a year, growth is sputtering and government restrictions on hard currency have throttled back imports. Many basic products, like toilet paper and corn flour, are in short supply, and when they do show up, consumers often have to wait in long lines to buy them.
Other chronic problems include electrical failures, such as one just days before the election that knocked out power to Caracas, the capital, and much of the western half of the country.
Mr. Maduro had appeared weak after narrowly winning an election to replace Mr. Chávez in April, and he stumbled often in his first months in office. But he seemed to gain confidence in recent weeks, in particular with a forceful campaign to make retailers lower the prices they charge for a wide array of goods, including appliances, televisions, car parts and toys.
Mr. Maduro claims that the country's problems are caused by enemies' waging an "economic war" against his government, and the electrical failures by sabotage.
"The people have told the world that the revolution continues," he said late Sunday.
Ms. Lucena said the ruling party had kept control of a majority of the country's 337 mayoralties. But the opposition made gains in some key cities, like the capital of Barinas, Mr. Chávez's home state and a bastion of government support. Voters also cast ballots for thousands of local legislators.
Caracas has six mayors: one in each of the city's five municipalities and a general metropolitan mayor. The opposition had held five of the six posts.
Opposition leaders cast the election as a referendum on Mr. Maduro's government but were frustrated in their hope to win a majority of votes nationwide.
Henrique Capriles, the opposition leader who ran against Mr. Maduro in April, had traveled around the country to campaign for local candidates, and to some degree, the outcome of the election could be seen as a test of his leadership and his ability to extend his personal popularity to the rest of the opposition.
The election was characterized by the widespread use of government resources in favor of the ruling party's candidates. In the Caracas subway system, for example, giant posters supported the mayoral candidacy of the United Socialist Party incumbent in the city's largest municipality, Libertador. Government-operated television stations continually promoted Socialist candidates and vilified the opposition.

Abstract: On Thursday, the European Central Bank raised its estimate for growth next year by just 0.1 percentage point to a still-anemic 1.1 percent; the central bank expects the euro zone -- the 17 European nations that use the euro -- to show a contraction of 0.4 percentage point once all the data for 2013 is in.

Full text:   Stoked by rising inventories, the American economy grew at a significantly faster pace in the third quarter than first estimated, but probably at the expense of economic activity during the current quarter as businesses work off some of the excess stock on their shelves and in warehouses.
As investors digested the better-than-expected data on Thursday from the Commerce Department for July, August and September, many economists immediately cut their estimates for fourth-quarter growth. Barclays, for example, now expects the nation's gross domestic product to advance at only a 1.5 percent annual rate, down from 2 percent and far below the government's latest estimate of a 3.6 percent pace for the third quarter. A final revision is scheduled Dec. 20.
Still, the latest data comes at a time when other signs are pointing to improved economic performance next year, both in the United States and abroad, including more robust manufacturing activity and hiring.
In London on Thursday, British officials raised their projections for growth in 2013 and 2014, a sharp reversal from a year ago, when Britain was flirting with a double-dip recession.
On the Continent, however, the outlook is bleaker.
On Thursday, the European Central Bank raised its estimate for growth next year by just 0.1 percentage point to a still-anemic 1.1 percent; the central bank expects the euro zone -- the 17 European nations that use the euro -- to show a contraction of 0.4 percentage point once all the data for 2013 is in.
"All in all, we're seeing positive developments," Mario Draghi, the president of the central bank, said at a news conference, after the bank left its main interest rate unchanged at 0.25 percent.
The situation in Europe makes the United States look good by comparison, even if things are not as rosy as the latest figures from Washington might suggest.
"You can never be unhappy with a 3.6 percent number for gross domestic product," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. "But the details are more sobering than the headlines. Apart from the inventory numbers, the revisions are pretty trivial."
"Either companies thought demand would accelerate and built inventories in anticipation of sales that didn't happen," Mr. Shepherdson added, "or they're building in anticipation of stronger demand in the fourth quarter." With demand uncertain in the final three months of the year, Mr. Shepherdson expects fourth-quarter growth will probably run at a pace of 1 to 2 percent.
The economy's performance in the final months of 2013 will also determine the denouement of one of the longest-running dramas on Wall Street -- the timing of when the Federal Reserve begins easing its stimulus efforts. Investors and traders had expected policy makers to begin tapering its monthly $85 billion bond purchases in September, but the central bank held off because of mixed economic data.
Although the latest data on growth in gross domestic product comes after a series of better-than-expected figures in the United States, American central bankers don't appear to be in a rush to pull back on the stimulus. While they could act as soon as the next Fed meeting later this month, many analysts do not expect a move until early 2014.
On Thursday, the president of one regional Fed bank indicated that he remained cautious. "The strong third quarter doesn't make a trend," said Dennis P. Lockhart, president of the Atlanta Fed. "I am not prepared to interpret the revised third-quarter number as an indication that the economy is on a much stronger track -- I think we're still on that relatively moderate growth track."
The spotlight on the Fed will grow more intense after Friday, when the Labor Department reports the latest figures for job creation and the unemployment rate in November. Although many economists say that the job market will remain cloudy because of the aftereffect of October's government shutdown, the report will be closely watched because it will provide the last major clue to the economy before Fed policy makers gather on Dec. 17 and 18.
"It's a big number," said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial. "I think they won't taper in December, but it is close."
With a gain of 204,000 positions, the jobs data for October was surprisingly robust, catching most economists off-guard. On Friday, the consensus calls for payrolls to have increased by 185,000 last month with the unemployment rate falling to 7.2 percent, according to Bloomberg News.
On Thursday, the Labor Department said initial weekly jobless claims unexpectedly dropped to 298,000, the lowest in more than two months.
Experts warn the numbers could be volatile, especially the unemployment rate, which is based on a survey separate from the one that tracks hiring and was affected heavily by furloughed government workers in October. The subsequent return of those workers could push the unemployment rate back down more sharply for November, economists said. If it drops to 7.1 percent, it would reach the lowest level in five years.
"The unemployment rate is a complete guess," said Ellen Zentner, senior United States economist at Morgan Stanley. Even if the more reliable payroll number is stronger than predicted, she said there was little chance of a Fed move this month because fourth-quarter growth looks so weak. Morgan Stanley expects the United States economy to expand by just 1 percent in the final three months of the year.

You know the drill: it's yet another "reboot" that will go nowhere; none of it will have any effect on policy, and so on. But before we talk about the speech's possible political impact or lack thereof, shouldn't we look at the substance? Was what the president said true? Was it new? If the answer to these questions is yes -- and it is -- then what he said deserves a serious hearing.
And once you realize that, you also realize that the speech may matter a lot more than the cynics imagine.
First, about those truths: Mr. Obama laid out a disturbing -- and, unfortunately, all too accurate -- vision of an America losing touch with its own ideals, an erstwhile land of opportunity becoming a class-ridden society. Not only do we have an ever-growing gap between a wealthy minority and the rest of the nation; we also, he declared, have declining mobility, as it becomes harder and harder for the poor and even the middle class to move up the economic ladder. And he linked rising inequality with falling mobility, asserting that Horatio Alger stories are becoming rare precisely because the rich and the rest are now so far apart.
This isn't entirely new terrain for Mr. Obama. What struck me about this speech, however, was what he had to say about the sources of rising inequality. Much of our political and pundit class remains devoted to the notion that rising inequality, to the extent that it's an issue at all, is all about workers lacking the right skills and education. But the president now seems to accept progressive arguments that education is at best one of a number of concerns, that America's growing class inequality largely reflects political choices, like the failure to raise the minimum wage along with inflation and productivity.
And because the president was willing to assign much of the blame for rising inequality to bad policy, he was also more forthcoming than in the past about ways to change the nation's trajectory, including a rise in the minimum wage, restoring labor's bargaining power, and strengthening, not weakening, the safety net.
And there was this: "When it comes to our budget, we should not be stuck in a stale debate from two years ago or three years ago. A relentlessly growing deficit of opportunity is a bigger threat to our future than our rapidly shrinking fiscal deficit." Finally! Our political class has spent years obsessed with a fake problem -- worrying about debt and deficits that never posed any threat to the nation's future -- while showing no interest in unemployment and stagnating wages. Mr. Obama, I'm sorry to say, bought into that diversion. Now, however, he's moving on.
Still, does any of this matter? The conventional pundit wisdom of the moment is that Mr. Obama's presidency has run aground, even that he has become irrelevant. But this is silly. In fact, it's silly in at least three ways.
First, much of the current conventional wisdom involves extrapolating from Obamacare's shambolic start, and assuming that things will be like that for the next three years. They won't. HealthCare.gov is working much better, people are signing up in growing numbers, and the whole mess is already receding in the rear-view mirror.
Second, Mr. Obama isn't running for re-election. At this point, he needs to be measured not by his poll numbers but by his achievements, and his health reform, which represents a major strengthening of America's social safety net, is a huge achievement. He'll be considered one of our most important presidents as long as he can defend that achievement and fend off attempts to tear down other parts of the safety net, like food stamps. And by making a powerful, cogent case that we need a stronger safety net to preserve opportunity in an age of soaring inequality, he's setting himself up for exactly such a defense.
Finally, ideas matter, even if they can't be turned into legislation overnight. The wrong turn we've taken in economic policy -- our obsession with debt and "entitlements," when we should have been focused on jobs and opportunity -- was, of course, driven in part by the power of wealthy vested interests. But it wasn't just raw power. The fiscal scolds also benefited from a sort of ideological monopoly: for several years you just weren't considered serious in Washington unless you worshipped at the altar of Simpson and Bowles.
Now, however, we have the president of the United States breaking ranks, finally sounding like the progressive many of his supporters thought they were backing in 2008. This is going to change the discourse -- and, eventually, I believe, actual policy.
So don't believe the cynics. This was an important speech by a president who can still make a very big difference.

Full text:   TEHRAN -- For years, the workers at the Iranian printing house spewed out posters with state propaganda calling for "Death to America" and resistance to the West.
Now, in the aftermath of the temporary nuclear agreement reached last month between Iran and the world powers -- and the lifting of some of the economic sanctions that have crippled Iran's economy -- they have their eye on a new market: Christmas cards for Iranian companies that want to reach out once again to their international contacts.
"We are seeing a light at the end of the tunnel," said Ali Sabzevari, one of the company's employees, who said the company was flooded with orders for greeting cards after the deal. "We all want to be part of the world again."
Increasingly isolated in recent years as the sanctions noose tightened, Iran's window to the world has opened a tiny bit as the nuclear agreement promises to ease some sanctions on petrochemical exports and spare parts for Iranian cars and airplanes, as well as releasing $7 billion in funds frozen from oil sales.
While the most debilitating sanctions remain in effect, including those on oil sales and banking transactions, Iran has been swept in recent weeks with an unaccustomed emotion -- hope. It has spread among private investors, companies and state-run factories that have begun to plan for a future in which all measures against the country will be lifted.
Even the most cynical say that, if nothing else, something is better than nothing.
"My company was on the verge of bankruptcy," said Mr. Sabzevari, who added that he had felt humiliated for the years he had to resort to printing anti-American propaganda. "At least this is a first step toward a more humane life. Let's just say that printing Christmas greetings makes me feel a whole lot happier. I guess that's a start."
President Hassan Rouhani, who was surprisingly elected in June promising to end the nuclear crisis, improve the economy and restore the "dignity of Iranians in the world," has together with his administration gone out on a limb to try to convince his people that good times are underway.
They point to a 14 percent gain in Tehran's stock market since the signing of the deal, the stabilization of the national currency and a drop in the inflation rate.
Mr. Rouhani has promised that the agreement is a first step to "the collapse of the sanctions regime." Western companies, such as the French oil giant Total and Anglo-Dutch Shell, have said they are eager to return to the Iranian market, as have the French automakers Renault and Peugeot.
"Following our victories in domestic and foreign policy, now people have got their eyes on the economy," the minister of the economy, Ali Tayyebnia, told a semiofficial news agency last week.
In front of Tehran's stock exchange, Hassan Zarif said he had noticed a positive change since the nuclear deal was reached. After 10 dry years, business had picked up for the Persian-language translations of American books for investors that he sells.
"This one sells pretty good," Mr. Zarif said, holding up a copy of "Technical Analysis of the Financial Markets," by John J. Murphy. "But people also love books with Warren Buffett on them."
Mr. Zarif, who said he was not related to Iran's foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said he himself had bought some shares in a petrochemical company, making a profit of about $400 in recent months. "Not bad for someone like me," he said, laughing while pointing at his torn clothes.
Inside the exchange people stared at monitors showing various indexes, under a portrait of the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, that also had the words, "Be a supporter of the leader, so the country will be good." Noticing an uptick in the shares of cement factories and petrochemical companies, most semi-state owned, two middle-class women carrying designer bags said they had come to start trading.
"I'm taking a bet," said Shirin Askari of Tehran, who was ready to invest $1,200 she had saved. "But it might just work out, maybe this is the right moment to step in and hope for growth."
The rise of the stock exchange also has to do with investors selling their gold and currency, said one trader, Mohammad Hassannejad. "It seems our currency will be stable for now, so those with money are coming here," he said.
Mr. Zarif, standing outside next to his books, said he hoped good times were finally coming.
If it turned out differently, that would not be a real problem. "In Iran even in difficult times, some people are capable of making money," he said.
Some experts on the economy cautioned that the euphoria could be short-lived. "It shows people are desperate for good news," said Kevan Harris, a Princeton University sociologist who conducts research on Iran's economy and travels regularly to the country. "Bad news can prick that bubble."

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- President Obama left the White House on Wednesday for one of the capital's working-class neighborhoods to talk about the economy, not simply to divert attention from the troubles of his Affordable Care Act but also to explain how that law, for all of its flaws, fits into his vision for Americans' economic security and upward mobility.
That vision -- of an economic partnership between government and its citizens -- is one that Mr. Obama has described since he was a state senator in Illinois, and it draws on the legacies of three Republican presidents: Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt and Dwight D. Eisenhower.
On Wednesday, he reiterated the policies required to carry it out, even though it has long been clear the opposition from Republicans is likely to make many of them unattainable.
"It's true that government cannot prevent all of the downsides of the technological change and global competition," the president said. "But," he added, "we've also seen how government action time and again can make an enormous difference in increasing opportunity and bolstering ladders into the middle class."
After weeks on the defensive about problems with the new health insurance marketplaces, Mr. Obama was at times combative toward Republicans. If they oppose his ideas for addressing "the defining challenge of our time, making sure our economy works for every working American," then, he said in remarks directed at Republicans, "You owe it to the American people to tell us what you are for."
The address was intended to echo one he delivered two years ago this month in Osawatomie, Kan., where he honored Roosevelt's call a century earlier for a "new nationalism." Drawing historical parallels to past federal investments like land-grant colleges, Depression-era public works, Interstate highways and the G.I. Bill, Mr. Obama on Wednesday pressed for his proposals to promote manufacturing, energy innovations, education, infrastructure projects and more.
Four cabinet members, several Democratic members of Congress, and Mayor Vincent C. Gray of Washington were among the officials on hand, reflecting the importance that the White House had attached to the president's remarks.
He delivered his address from an arts, education and social services complex about six miles from the White House, in the Anacostia neighborhood of Southeast Washington. The site itself symbolized his message: Federal and local governments, corporations, foundations and philanthropists shared its $27 million cost to benefit local residents seeking to escape poverty. He spoke to observe the 10th anniversary of the Center for American Progress, a policy research group that includes former officials from the Obama and Clinton administrations.
Trends since the 1970s, Mr. Obama said, have led to "a dangerous and growing inequality and lack of upward mobility that has jeopardized middle-class America's basic bargain -- that if you work hard, you have a chance to get ahead."
He cited statistics putting the gap between the rich and everyone else in the United States on a par with that in Jamaica and Argentina, and showing that children have a greater chance in Canada, Germany or France to move up the social ladder than they do in the United States. The trend, he said, was bad for the economy, social harmony and democracy.
Describing what steps he has taken, Mr. Obama highlighted the health care law.
For decades, he said, health care "was one yawning gap in the safety net that did more than anything else to expose working families" to economic insecurity. "That's why we fought for the Affordable Care Act," he said.
Despite the program's problems, he added, the number of insured people is up, medical costs are down and all Americans with insurance have new protections and benefits.
"It is these numbers, not the ones in any poll, that will ultimately determine the fate of this law," Mr. Obama said, adding, "This law is going to work, and for the sake of our economic security, it needs to work."
Among Republicans seeking the law's repeal, Mr. Obama singled out Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader, whose state has one of the most successful new insurance marketplaces: "He might want to check with the more than 60,000 people in his home state who are already set to finally have health insurance."
Still, prospects for Mr. Obama's goals in his final three years are hardly promising. His speech came at the close of a year in which none of his other economic initiatives have made it through Congress.
The Senate passed a bipartisan, business-backed immigration bill to give about 11 million illegal immigrants a path to citizenship, but House Republican leaders refuse to take it up. Budget talks with Senate Republicans fizzled, probably dashing Mr. Obama's three-year-old hopes of a "grand bargain" on spending and taxes, one that would combine deficit reductions in future years with immediate financing for infrastructure, education and technology projects. Spending cuts are squeezing the very programs that Mr. Obama has wanted to expand.
And the broader problems he addressed in his speech defy easy solutions. Mr. Obama drew some of his biggest applause when he renewed his call for what he sees as a small but crucial step -- an increase in the federal minimum wage, which at $7.25 an hour is lower than the minimum in a growing number of states. He and other supporters say an increase would also help workers earning above minimum wage by creating pressure to increase their pay, and in turn would spur more spending and economic growth.
Especially with low-paying service jobs among the fastest growing in the economy, Mr. Obama said, "It's well past the time to raise the minimum wage," he said.
Mr. Obama's push is timed, in part, to help Senate Democrats pass a measure that would raise the minimum wage to $10.10 in three stages over two years, raise the separate minimum wage for tipped workers and peg both to rise with inflation. But House Republicans oppose the legislation, arguing that an increase would force many employers to cut their work force.
Mr. Obama disputed those arguments, and cited widespread public support for an increase. In a poll last month by CBS News, two-thirds of Americans -- including more than half of Republicans -- said the federal minimum wage should be higher.
The president also called on Congress to extend the food stamps program -- House Republicans' demands for $40 billion more in spending cuts over 10 years has held up passage of a farm bill -- and federal payments for the long-term unemployed.
"Christmas time is no time," he said, "for Congress to tell more than one million of these Americans that they have lost their unemployment insurance."

Full text:   LONDON -- European regulators said on Monday that they expected to conduct a full inquiry into a deal to build Britain's first nuclear power station since 1995, threatening delays that could undermine investment plans for the 16 billion pound project.
The concern in Brussels is that the terms of the contract might involve British government subsidies that violate European competition rules. At issue is whether the rates the government has guaranteed to the power plant's operators for 35 years will distort the market for electricity in the European Union.
"We are starting to analyze what is in the British proposal," the European competition commissioner, Joaquín Almunia, said at a news conference in Brussels on Monday. "Probably we will open a formal investigation." The comments, which were reported by Reuters, were confirmed by Mr. Almunia's office.
Mr. Almunia said he had received formal notification from Britain two or three weeks ago about the agreement reached in October with EDF, the French state-controlled utility, to build the plant at Hinkley Point in southwest England.
The European Commission, which is the antitrust regulator for the 28-nation European Union, is empowered to ensure that the bloc's single market is not distorted by state subsidies.
But the deal is contentious within Britain as well, not only because it gives the French company EDF guarantees of profit from the electricity generated -- whose rates will be paid mainly by Britons -- but also because it opens the door to financing from China. EDF is working out an agreement with two large Chinese state nuclear companies to take 30 to 40 percent of the project.
Because no other deal of this type has been put before European regulators, the outcome is unpredictable. The commission has always been sensitive to the different positions member governments have taken toward nuclear policy, leaving the energy mix in each country up to national capitals. Moreover, with both Britain and France having a stake in the success of the Hinkley Point project, worth about $26 billion, any decision to block it would involve taking on two of the biggest European Union nations.
Under European rules, the commission has two months from formal notification of a deal where there is a potential issue over state aid to decide whether to approve it or mount a full-scale investigation. A full inquiry has no time limit, so its length depends on the complexity of the case.
"This is a rather complex issue -- I expect a lengthy process," said Claude Turmes, a Green Party European legislator from Luxembourg. "I see that the commission will have to change at least certain terms of the contract," said Mr. Turmes, who follows the issue closely as a member of the Industry and Energy Committee in the Parliament.
Mr. Almunia's spokesman, Antoine Colombani, described the case as "new and complex" and said it was premature to prejudge the outcome of inquiries. The British government has set July 2014 as the target date for a final decision on whether to proceed with the project.
Ian Forrester, an antitrust lawyer in Brussels, said "these cases can take a very long time, certainly many months. However, they can also be accelerated."
In London, the British energy minister, Michael Fallon, said he had "no reason to believe the commission will block it," Reuters reported, and the spokesman for Prime Minister David Cameron said he was not aware of any specific objections from Brussels.
A more likely outcome would be one in which the commission outlined changes or imposed conditions in exchange for approving the deal. But the uncertainty caused by an inquiry could derail the timetable for reaching investment decisions on the project.
Hinkley Point would be the first nuclear power station to be built in Britain in nearly two decades. The government has portrayed the project as crucial to keeping the lights on in Britain and to reducing carbon emissions from electricity generation as the current aging fleet of nuclear power stations and coal-powered power plants are phased out in the next few years.
The twin reactors of the new plant would provide the equivalent of about 7 percent of Britain's current power supplies. While nuclear power comes with drawbacks like the possibility of major accidents and the still-unresolved issue of how to dispose of waste fuel, it is a low emitter of carbon dioxide.
The British government is providing what might be deemed to be huge subsidies for the plant by guaranteeing a price of £92.50 per megawatt hour, almost twice the current wholesale rate. The tariff will be indexed to inflation for the 35-year expected life of the power station. The government will also guarantee about £10 billion in loans for Hinkley Point.
Roland Vetter, an analyst at CF Partners, a commodities trading house based in London, forecast that EDF would receive more than £700 million in subsidies during 2023, the first year the power station is expected to operate.
The government has devised a mechanism by which any shortfall in power prices would be made up by consumers rather than the state, but some analysts question whether this approach would successfully skirt the issue.

As Hospital Costs Soar, Single Stitch Tops $500

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDEDSAN FRANCISCO -- With blood oozing from deep lacerations, the two patients arrived at California Pacific Medical Center's tidy emergency room. Deepika Singh, 26, had gashed her knee at a backyard barbecue. Orla Roche, a rambunctious toddler on vacation with her family, had tumbled from a couch, splitting open her forehead on a table.
On a quiet Saturday in May, nurses in blue scrubs quickly ushered the two patients into treatment rooms. The wounds were cleaned, numbed and mended in under an hour. "It was great -- they had good DVDs, the staff couldn't have been nicer," said Emer Duffy, Orla's mother.
Then the bills arrived. Ms. Singh's three stitches cost $2,229.11. Orla's forehead was sealed with a dab of skin glue for $1,696. "When I first saw the charge, I said, 'What could possibly have cost that much?' " recalled Ms. Singh. "They billed for everything, every pill."
In a medical system notorious for opaque finances and inflated bills, nothing is more convoluted than hospital pricing, economists say. Hospital charges represent about a third of the $2.7 trillion annual United States health care bill, the biggest single segment, according to government statistics, and are the largest driver of medical inflation, a new study in The Journal of the American Medical Association found.
A day spent as an inpatient at an American hospital costs on average more than $4,000, five times the charge in many other developed countries, according to the International Federation of Health Plans, a global network of health insurance industries. The most expensive hospitals charge more than $12,500 a day. And at many of them, including California Pacific Medical Center, emergency rooms are profit centers. That is why one of the simplest and oldest medical procedures -- closing a wound with a needle and thread -- typically leads to bills of at least $1,500 and often much more.
At Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, Daniel Diaz, 29, a public relations executive, was billed $3,355.96 for five stitches on his finger after cutting himself while peeling an avocado. At a hospital in Jacksonville, Fla., Arch Roberts Jr., 56, a former government employee, was charged more than $2,000 for three stitches after being bitten by a dog. At Mercy Hospital in Port Huron, Mich., Chelsea Manning, 22, a student, received bills for close to $3,000 for six stitches after she tripped running up a path. Insurers and patients negotiated lower prices, but those charges were a starting point.
The main reason for high hospital costs in the United States, economists say, is fiscal, not medical: Hospitals are the most powerful players in a health care system that has little or no price regulation in the private market.
Rising costs of drugs, medical equipment and other services, and fees from layers of middlemen, play a significant role in escalating hospital bills, of course. But just as important is that mergers and consolidation have resulted in a couple of hospital chains -- like Partners in Boston, or Banner in Phoenix -- dominating many parts of the country, allowing them to command high prices from insurers and employers.
Sutter Health, California Pacific Medical Center's parent company, operates more than two dozen community hospitals in Northern California, almost all in middle-class or high-income neighborhoods. Its clout has helped California Pacific Medical Center, the state's largest private nonprofit hospital, also earn the highest net income in California. Prices for many of the procedures at the San Francisco hospital are among the top 20 percent in the country, according to a New York Times analysis of data released by the federal government.
"Sutter is a leader -- a pioneer -- in figuring out how to amass market power to raise prices and decrease competition," said Glenn Melnick, a professor of health economics at the University of Southern California. "How do hospitals set prices? They set prices to maximize revenue, and they raise prices as much as they can -- all the research supports that."
In other countries, the price of a day in the hospital often includes many basic services. Not here. The "chargemaster," the price list created by each hospital, typically has more than ten thousand entries, and almost nothing -- even an aspirin, a bag of IV fluid, or a visit from a physical therapist to help a patient get out of bed -- is free. Those lists are usually secret, but California requires them to be filed with health regulators and disclosed.
California Pacific Medical Center's 400-page chargemaster for this year contains some eye-popping figures: from $32,901 for an X-ray study of the heart's arteries to $25,646.88 for gall bladder removal (doctor's fees not included) to $5,510 for a simple vaginal delivery (not including $731 for each hour of labor, or $137 for each bag of IV fluid). Even basic supplies or services carry huge markups: $20 for a codeine pill (50 cents at Rite-Aid or Walgreens), $543 for a breast-pump kit ($25 online), $4,495 for a CT scan of the abdomen (about $400 at an outpatient facility nearby). Plenty of other hospitals set similar prices.
Dr. Warren Browner, the chief executive officer of California Pacific Medical Center, said that there were good reasons that hospitals charged what they did: They must have highly trained professionals available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. They must constantly upgrade to the latest equipment and building standards to meet patients' expectations and state mandates. They charge paying or well-insured patients more to compensate for others they treat at a loss.
"Hospital care is extremely expensive to produce and to have available for everyone in the community," he said, noting that hospitals needed to have a neurosurgeon on call in case a patient turned up with a blood clot on the brain. "We take every penny of the revenue we earn and use it to build new and better facilities for everyone in the city."
Some health economists say that even though most hospitals are nonprofit, they nonetheless are often flush with revenue and guilty of unnecessary spending.
"Hospitals are self-fueling, ever-expanding machines," said James Robinson, an economist and professor of health policy at the University of California, Berkeley. "There is an infinite amount of stuff to buy -- amenities, machines, new wings, higher salaries, more nurses."
"But," he asked, "to deliver good health care, what do you need?"
Few Constraints
There is little science to how hospitals determine the prices they print on hospital bills.
"Chargemaster prices are basically arbitrary, not connected to underlying costs or market prices," said Professor Melnick, the economist. Hospitals "can set them at any level they want. There are no market constraints."
Prices for any item or service are set by each hospital and move up and down yearly, and show extraordinary variability, health economists say. The codeine that costs $20 and the bag of IV fluid that costs $137 at California Pacific are charged at $1 and $16 at the University of California San Francisco Medical Center, across town. But U.C.S.F. Medical Center charges $1,600 for an amniocentesis, which costs $687 at California Pacific.
After each hospital stay or visit, computer programs and human coders and billers use the chargemaster price list to translate the services rendered into a price. Sutter employs more than 1,300 people at a special center in Roseville, Calif., to perform this and other administrative tasks for its hospitals. Emergency room visits typically include separate charges for doctor's services and for supplies, as well as a "facility fee" -- the charge for walking in the door.
Orla Roche's bill, for example, included $529 for "supplies and devices," though her mother is perplexed about what those are: Orla left the emergency room with gauze wrapped round her head (under $1 at Internet supply stores), festooned with a pink cartoon sticker. According to the chargemaster price list for California Pacific, a vial of skin glue is billed at $181, a tube of antibiotic cream at $125.84 and a vial of local anesthetic at $79.73. These items can be purchased for $15.99, $36.99 and $5 on the Internet, though hospitals -- which buy wholesale and in bulk -- pay far less.
The bill also included $1,167 for the facility fee, which was classified at Level 3 -- the middle of the scale, though Orla's treatment was one of the most simple emergency room interventions. At Lenox Hill in New York, Daniel Diaz's unusually detailed bill for his stitches included $1,828 for emergency room services, $628 for repairing the wound, $571.83 for "application of a finger splint," $97.10 for a tetanus shot, and $311 for someone to give the injection. At Sparrow Hospital in Lansing, Mich., 2-year-old Ben Bellar's bill for six stitches, more than $2,000, included $145.20 for "pharmacy" -- a spoonful of ibuprofen and local anesthetic, his mother said.
Economists note that hospitals can bill for emergency room care with relative impunity, since injured patients generally rush to the nearest treatment facility. But worried about high prices, even the sick sometimes shop around. When Jamie Burke, 33, a graduate student in North Carolina, came to after she was knocked out during a soccer game in April, she started searching on her smartphone for an in-network hospital as a friend drove.
"It was crazy," she said, "but luckily I wasn't unconscious, so I could figure it out."
She is glad she did: Though the hospital billed $5,039, her insurer's in-network contracted rate was about $2,700. With copays and coinsurance, she owed $600 for the visit.
The uninsured are particularly vulnerable to high prices since they have no one to argue on their behalf. When Arch Roberts Jr. got his bill of more than $2,000 for stitches, he explained that he was uninsured and his business had failed during the housing crisis, so he could not afford the fee. The hospital offered him a "charity care discount" -- a price that was still out of range. "I don't have $800 to pay them any more than I have $2,000" for three stitches, he said, noting that the hospital has been "relentless" in its collection efforts.
Paths to Profit
Once perennial money pits, emergency rooms have become big moneymakers for most hospitals in the last decade, experts say, as they raised their fees and "managed" their patient mix. California Pacific Medical Center has nearly doubled its emergency room fees since 2005, its chargemaster price lists show.
California Pacific's emergency room is not a trauma center; poor or uninsured trauma patients who require lengthy inpatient stays can strain a hospital budget. And insurers allow emergency rooms to bill more than urgent-care centers for simple procedures like stitches or X-raying a sprained ankle, making such procedures profitable. Indeed, the financial prospects are so appealing that doctors' groups in Texas are opening free-standing "emergency rooms" that are not connected to hospitals.
"Hospitals see where they're making money and try to do more of that," said Dr. David Gifford, a former health commissioner of Rhode Island, who has studied how labs price their tests. He said that laboratory tests and X-rays are priced high and are profitable, though there is no difference in quality from national commercial labs that charge far less. A blood count and blood electrolyte test -- ordered every day for most inpatients and often in the emergency room -- are priced at $259.06 and $293.25 on California Pacific Medical Center's chargemaster price list. Insurers often pay outside labs less than $10 for the services.
And, like any business, many hospitals try to do fewer services that are not well paid. In 2012, over loud patient protests, California Pacific Medical Center outsourced its kidney dialysis unit to DaVita Health Care Partners, a commercial company, citing decreasing reimbursement. More than five years ago, after Sutter acquired St. Luke's, a decrepit hospital in a poor neighborhood, it tried to shut the facility and convert it to an outpatient clinic, which often generate scans and other expensive tests. (The City of San Francisco rejected the plan.) It did close the hospital's acute psychiatric unit, a division that almost always loses money.
"You need a Ph.D. in health economics" to understand medical pricing, said Dr. Browner, who has acknowledged that California Pacific's chargemaster prices might appear high. But he added, "We have to recoup what it costs to keep open, what it costs to take care of the un- and underinsured and to rebuild."
He said that MediCal, California's Medicaid program, pays California Pacific Medical Center only 10 to 20 percent of its actual costs for care. Medicare pays about 70 percent, he said, generally with a predetermined flat fee for each admission based on the patient's diagnosis. In contrast, many private insurers still pay separately for services rendered, based on discounts from the chargemaster prices.
Dr. Browner also pointed to what health care executives call the "Saudi sheikh problem" at some hospitals.
"You don't really want to change your charges if you have a Saudi sheikh come in with a suitcase full of cash who's going to pay full charges," he said.
But how much actual charity care does a hospital like California Pacific Medical Center perform? And are insurers and patients paying hospitals for better quality? Or also for amenities like valet parking, useless medical gadgetry and inflated salaries?
Though hospitals' nonprofit status allows them to reap tens or hundreds of millions of dollars in tax benefits, California Pacific Medical Center's main campuses spent 1.27 percent of their more than $1.1 billion in net patient revenues in 2011 on free care for indigent or uninsured patients, lower than the state average of 2.07 percent, according to statistics compiled by the San Francisco Department of Public Health. The far smaller St. Luke's branch spent 5.32 percent that year.
Sutter, based in Sacramento, employs 28 officials who make more than $1 million a year, and four of them are among the top-paid hospital executives in the state. Sutter's chief executive officer makes more than $5 million. In 2011, Dr. Browner, 62, a distinguished physician who spent much of his career in academics, made more than $1.2 million, according to tax documents.
California Pacific, Sutter's main campus, is in upscale Pacific Heights. It has just broken ground on a $2.7 billion renovation, which includes a new flagship hospital. Though the project was initiated to meet new state earthquake standards, the facility is designed as a sleek glass and marble structure with all private rooms, underground parking and roof gardens with flowers and bees "to enhance the quality of the healing environment," according to California Pacific Medical Center's website. Its Facebook page has called it "the coolest hospital in San Francisco, possibly the country and even the world."
Consumers may appreciate -- or demand -- features that contribute to bigger hospital bills. But studies have found no correlation between prices and patient outcomes. A California state rating of hospital services by the California Health Care Foundation gave California Pacific Medical Center average scores in most categories, though its surgical-care measures were rated "superior."
Its crosstown neighbor, University of California San Francisco, a nationally ranked academic institution, charges far less per day than California Pacific, when the greater severity of illnesses of its patients is factored in, Professor Melnick said. In fact, a recent study in the publication Annals of Surgery, a monthly review of surgical science, found that hospitals with the highest complication rates tended to have higher prices.
From such variations, economists conclude that "costs" are highly discretionary, noting that hospitals in other developed countries often provide high-quality care, with better outcomes in comparatively no-frills environments. Said Dr. Robinson, the Berkeley health economist: "If you pay hospitals more, they spend it. If you pay them less, they adjust. The only way to pay less for health care -- is to pay less for health care."
Hospital officials like to say that their list prices do not reflect what most patients actually pay, because private and government insurers negotiate discounts. Simone Singh, a professor of health management and policy at the University of Michigan, estimated that insurers generally paid 40 to 50 percent of charges. But with powerful chains like Sutter, prices are high and the discounts often are not so generous. Patients are left paying more.
A Price 'Sequoia'
For her three stitches at California Pacific Medical Center, Deepika Singh ended up paying $768.56 -- a lot of money for a 26-year-old retail supply chain manager -- of the $1,813 rate her insurer negotiated for the approximately $2,200 bill. Ms. Duffy owed $1,366 after her insurer's discount on 2-year-old Orla's $1,700 bill, since the family had not met its annual deductible. "How much is that per minute?" she asked.
Across California, Sutter hospitals have proved expert at the business of medicine. "Our members are very exercised about Sutter -- it has increased prices disproportionately," said David Lansky, chief executive officer of the Pacific Business Group on Health, which represents 60 of California's biggest private employers in its health care negotiations. "Sutter has been successful at leveraging their huge size in dictating not just price but contract terms."
Its major competitor is Kaiser, a health maintenance organization that runs a closed network of hospitals and doctors. California Pacific Medical Center delivers more than half the babies in San Francisco and is the city's largest employer after Wells Fargo. Sutter contracts also include "gag clauses" that prevent employers from knowing what rates have been negotiated by their insurers on their behalf, Mr. Lansky said.
Chuck Idelson, a spokesman for the Institute for Health and Socio-Economic Policy, the research arm of the California Nurses Association, said Sutter prices were 40 to 70 percent above its rivals' for similar services. When Sutter bought Summit Hospital in Oakland in 1999, rates there went up 29 percent to 72 percent, researchers found. Because of pricing issues, proposed insurance plans under the Affordable Care Act did not initially include Sutter hospitals.
Terry Miller, 62, a businessman in the Bay Area, got a bill for $117,000 for a two-night stay at California Pacific Medical Center to place a stent to open one of his heart's clogged arteries -- a charge that did not include fees for the cardiologist and radiologist. According to the Medicare database, California Pacific Medical Center charged $43,679 for hospitalization to treat a simple pneumonia and $96,642 to treat a stroke; the Medicare payments for those illnesses were $8,046 and $9,583.
The high prices have had a ripple effect across Northern California, allowing smaller hospitals to charge more as well. "Sutter is the tallest Sequoia and everyone goes up just underneath them a bit," said Professor Melnick. He noted that hospital prices in California had more than doubled in the past decade, after adjustment for inflation.
And payouts in the Pacific region for simple emergency room treatments -- stitches, a sprained ankle and an upper respiratory infection -- were by far the highest in the country, about 50 percent higher than in the Northeast, according to an analysis performed for The Times. by the health care consulting firm Truven Health Analytics.
The Merger Factor
In theory, health care consolidation can lead to economies of scale, but not if it produces complex supersize systems. Excess administrative costs accounted for about $190 billion of the $2.5 trillion medical bill of the United States in 2009, the Institute of Medicine estimated this year -- money that could be used for other purposes.
"There is a big flurry of consolidation and the effects depend on what the objective of the health care system is," said Orry Jacobs of the health care consulting firm BDC Advisors. "If the intent is to improve care and bend cost curves, then networks can do so. If the objective is to corner the market and demand higher rates, then that will happen." Indeed, research shows that today's hospital mergers tend to drive up prices.
And employers have limited ability to fight back. Sutter operates the only hospital in some California cities. And employers have limited ability to fight back. Sutter operates the only hospital in some California cities. Because of pricing issues, fewer health plans offered by the University of California, Berkeley, will include Sutter hospitals in 2014 compared to this year.
As is often the case in American medicine, patients will decide if they are willing to pay the high price of care. Back home in New York City, Orla Duffy's head wound has healed nicely without further treatment. Deepika Singh had her stitches taken out at an urgent care clinic, costing $25 with her copay, during a business trip to Washington.
Daniel Diaz, who had been treated at Lenox Hill, Mr. Roberts and Amy Bernstein had no choice but to visit an emergency room this year for stitches. But they all refused to see a doctor for the follow-up.
"The amount was outrageous for the time it took to put them in," said Ms. Bernstein, 54, a real estate lawyer from Long Island, who cut herself cleaning knives while fixing a kitchen damaged by Hurricane Sandy. "I was so disgusted, I took them out myself."
Paying Till It Hurts: Articles in this series are examining the high costs of common medical encounters and how they contribute to health care spending in the United States.
Correction: December 18, 2013, Wednesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Dec. 3 about the high cost of hospital care in California omitted one hospital owned by Sutter Health that is accessible through the health plans offered to employees of the University of California, Berkeley, and referred imprecisely to the accessibility of another. Alta-Bates Summit Medical Center is indeed included in some of these plans' networks, but California Pacific Medical Center is only available to patients in a few plans with high coinsurance payments.

Full text:   LOS ANGELES -- Last week, Martin Scorsese winged off to Marrakesh, Morocco, where he will spend nine days adjudicating Prince Moulay Rachid's film festival.
But he left a not-so-little something behind: "The Wolf of Wall Street," a two-hour, 59-minute cinematic romp through the securities business -- his longest film ever.
Completed just last Wednesday and shown at two sneak-peek guild screenings on Saturday, "The Wolf of Wall Street" is the last, and possibly weirdest, of the Oscar season movies to surface, creating a type of parlor game for the gossipy movie industry. Daring to be both late and long is rare brinkmanship in a Hollywood that has become more accustomed to corporate discipline.
Will the picture, now scheduled for release on Christmas Day, do for crooked stock traders what Mr. Scorsese's "Goodfellas" did for the mob? Or might it find Paramount executives on the next plane to Morocco, looking for a filmmaker who dropped a problem in their laps?
For Paramount, the stakes are not inconsiderable. Though the Viacom-owned studio had spring-summer hits in "Star Trek Into Darkness" and "World War Z," it is running last among the major studios, with only about $823 million in domestic ticket sales, roughly half those of first-place Warner Brothers.
But the success or failure of Mr. Scorsese's film may also tell how the awards game is played in future years. While this has been a good year for viewers, the soft performance of "Rush," released by Universal, and the collapse of "The Fifth Estate," from DreamWorks and Disney, have reminded of the awards season risks. Will the big studios, having jumped back into the Oscar race with contenders like "Argo" and "Zero Dark Thirty" last year, pull back again, ceding the prize chase to the indies?
"The Wolf of Wall Street" is being released into what is shaping up to be a cluttered holiday season. There are five movies opening in wide release on Christmas Day -- two more than last year -- and a group of films, including "Saving Mr. Banks" and "The Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug," are expected to be strong holdover competitors.
Mr. Scorsese's film is rated R for "strong sexual content, graphic nudity, drug use and language throughout, and for some violence" -- and, along with another film about a seedy subject, Sony's "American Hustle," represent a turn from the year's more earnest awards fare, like "12 Years a Slave." Paramount in particular seems to be betting that moviegoers want some dirty fun for Christmas.
Unlike "Margin Call," a drama based on the crisis of 2007 and 2008, or "Wall Street," which tackled the junk bond era, the film that finally surfaced last week will offer no lessons about mainstream finance. Rather, it is a New York-based story about scammers scamming scammers. The star, Leonardo DiCaprio, surrounded by a cast of hundreds, plays Jordan Belfort, a real-life market manipulator born out of the boiler-room culture that flourished in the 1990s. He ultimately spent nearly two years in prison after being convicted in connection with securities fraud and money-laundering.
Eyebrows first arched in June, when Paramount released a provocative trailer -- in one snippet dwarfs are thrown at a dart board, backed by Kanye West's throbbing "Black Skinhead." "The big question," wrote TimeOut.com, is why ticket buyers should care "about these self-absorbed, money-grubbing, Armani-clad cretins."
In fact, Mr. Scorsese's movie walks much the same turf as "American Hustle," from the director David O. Russell. In that one a fictional fraud artist, played by Christian Bale, becomes embroiled with federal investigators during the Abscam operation in the late 1970s.
Paramount, which is releasing "The Wolf of Wall Street" in the United States (and Japan), in October bumped the film from a planned release on Nov. 15 to a new slot on Christmas Day. The sudden date change meant shifting Paramount's action-thriller, "Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit," from Christmas into January, while landing Mr. Scorsese's movie on top of another of the studio's Christmas bets, "Labor Day," directed by Jason Reitman.
The shift happened amid reports that Mr. Scorsese was showing friends and family a cut that exceeded three hours. (There were no formal research screenings, according to a person who was briefed on the proceedings and spoke on the condition of anonymity because of confidentiality strictures.)
Mr. Scorsese, 71, may have been able to push time limits -- in more ways than one -- because Paramount did not control the purse strings; "The Wolf of Wall Street" was financed by Red Granite Pictures, for a reported $100 million.
The problem is that there are only so many screens to go around, and exhibitors are reluctant to tie up real estate with long films; shorter movies like "Gravity," which ran 91 minutes, allow them to pack in more screenings and sell more candy.
Some of the most successful films of all time, of course, have been quite long. "Titanic," which ran three hours and 14 minutes, took in more than $3 billion worldwide in 1997, after adjusting for inflation. And Mr. Scorsese's own "Casino," which was just sixty seconds shorter than "The Wolf of Wall Street," became a modest hit in 1995.
"A film never fails simply because it's too long," said Phil Contrino, chief analyst for BoxOffice.com. If Mr. Scorsese has "made something that draws favorable comparisons to his other true-crime epics, then length won't matter."
Mr. Scorsese, once considered the director whose work was most likely to be passed over by awards committees, has been on a hot streak this decade, with a best picture winner and three additional nominees in "The Departed," "Hugo," "The Aviator" and "Gangs of New York."
A spokeswoman for Paramount declined to comment, and representatives for Mr. Scorsese did not respond to a query.
Mr. Scorsese finally screened an almost-finished cut of the film for an inner circle, including Mr. DiCaprio, and Paramount's chief executive, Brad Grey, in New York a week ago. But the film was not actually finished until two days later, on Wednesday, according to the person briefed on the film.
Tastemakers began getting answers on Saturday, as Paramount staged the first of some hastily convened awards screenings in Los Angeles.
"The danger with a movie that's late-breaking like this is usually, are people going to see it?" said Kristopher Tapley, editor at large of Hitfix.com, and one of perhaps a dozen professional Oscar handicappers who spent last week waiting for an invitation to see what is the final film on their checklist. "But everybody is going to see a Martin Scorsese movie," Mr. Tapley added.

Full text:   'Tis the season to be jolly -- or, at any rate, to spend a lot of time in shopping malls. It is also, traditionally, a time to reflect on the plight of those less fortunate than oneself -- for example, the person on the other side of that cash register.
The last few decades have been tough for many American workers, but especially hard on those employed in retail trade -- a category that includes both the sales clerks at your local Walmart and the staff at your local McDonald's. Despite the lingering effects of the financial crisis, America is a much richer country than it was 40 years ago. But the inflation-adjusted wages of nonsupervisory workers in retail trade -- who weren't particularly well paid to begin with -- have fallen almost 30 percent since 1973.
So can anything be done to help these workers, many of whom depend on food stamps -- if they can get them -- to feed their families, and who depend on Medicaid -- again, if they can get it -- to provide essential health care? Yes. We can preserve and expand food stamps, not slash the program the way Republicans want. We can make health reform work, despite right-wing efforts to undermine the program.
And we can raise the minimum wage.
First, a few facts. Although the national minimum wage was raised a few years ago, it's still very low by historical standards, having consistently lagged behind both inflation and average wage levels. Who gets paid this low minimum? By and large, it's the man or woman behind the cash register: almost 60 percent of U.S. minimum-wage workers are in either food service or sales. This means, by the way, that one argument often invoked against any attempt to raise wages -- the threat of foreign competition -- won't wash here: Americans won't drive to China to pick up their burgers and fries.
Still, even if international competition isn't an issue, can we really help workers simply by legislating a higher wage? Doesn't that violate the law of supply and demand? Won't the market gods smite us with their invisible hand? The answer is that we have a lot of evidence on what happens when you raise the minimum wage. And the evidence is overwhelmingly positive: hiking the minimum wage has little or no adverse effect on employment, while significantly increasing workers' earnings.
It's important to understand how good this evidence is. Normally, economic analysis is handicapped by the absence of controlled experiments. For example, we can look at what happened to the U.S. economy after the Obama stimulus went into effect, but we can't observe an alternative universe in which there was no stimulus, and compare the results.
When it comes to the minimum wage, however, we have a number of cases in which a state raised its own minimum wage while a neighboring state did not. If there were anything to the notion that minimum wage increases have big negative effects on employment, that result should show up in state-to-state comparisons. It doesn't.
So a minimum-wage increase would help low-paid workers, with few adverse side effects. And we're talking about a lot of people. Early this year the Economic Policy Institute estimated that an increase in the national minimum wage to $10.10 from its current $7.25 would benefit 30 million workers. Most would benefit directly, because they are currently earning less than $10.10 an hour, but others would benefit indirectly, because their pay is in effect pegged to the minimum -- for example, fast-food store managers who are paid slightly (but only slightly) more than the workers they manage.
Now, many economists have a visceral dislike of anything that sounds like price-fixing, even if the evidence strongly indicates that it would have positive effects. Some of these skeptics oppose doing anything to help low-wage workers. Others argue that we should subsidize, not regulate -- in particular, that we should expand the Earned Income Tax Credit (E.I.T.C.), an existing program that does indeed provide significant aid to low-income working families. And for the record, I'm all for an expanded E.I.T.C.
But there are, it turns out, good technical reasons to regard the minimum wage and the E.I.T.C. as complements -- mutually supportive policies, not substitutes. Both should be increased. Unfortunately, given the political realities, there is no chance whatsoever that a bill increasing aid to the working poor would pass Congress.
An increase in the minimum wage, on the other hand, just might happen, thanks to overwhelming public support. This support doesn't come just from Democrats or even independents; strong majorities of Republicans (57 percent) and self-identified conservatives (59 percent) favor an increase.
In short, raising the minimum wage would help many Americans, and might actually be politically possible. Let's give it a try.

Full text:   During most of the 20th century, wages in the United States were set not just by employers but by a mix of market and institutional mechanisms. Supply and demand were important factors; collective bargaining and minimum wage laws also played a key role. Under Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Richard M. Nixon, we even implemented more direct forms of wage controls.
These direct interventions, however, were temporary, and unions have become rare in most parts of the United States -- virtually disappearing from the private sector. This leaves minimum wage policies as one of the few institutional levers for setting a wage standard. But while we can set a wage floor using policy, should we? Or should we leave it to the market and deal with any adverse consequences, like poverty and inequality, using other policies, like tax credits and transfers? These longstanding questions take on a particular urgency as wage inequality continues to grow, and as we consider specific proposals to raise the federal minimum wage -- currently near a record low -- and to index future increases to the cost of living.
The idea of fairness has been at the heart of wage standards since their inception. This is evident in the very name of the legislation that established the minimum wage in 1938, the Fair Labor Standards Act. When Roosevelt sent the bill to Congress, he sent along a message declaring that America should be able to provide its working men and women "a fair day's pay for a fair day's work." And he tapped into a popular sentiment years earlier when he declared, "No business which depends for existence on paying less than living wages to its workers has any right to continue in this country."This type of concern for fairness actually runs deep in the human psyche. There is a widespread sense that it is unfair of employers to take advantage of workers who may have little recourse but to work at very low wages. For example, the economists Colin F. Camerer and Ernst Fehr have documented in numerous experimental studies that the preference for fairness in transactions is strong: individuals are often willing to sacrifice their own payoffs to punish those who are seen as acting unfairly, and such punishments activate reward-related neural circuits. People also strongly support banning transactions they see as exploitative of others -- even if they think such a ban would entail some economic costs.
Of course, if most minimum wage workers were middle-class teenagers, many of us might shrug off concerns about their wages, since they are taken care of in other ways. But in reality, the low-wage work force has become older and more educated over time. In 1979, among low-wage workers earning no more than $10 an hour (adjusted for inflation), 26 percent were teenagers between 16 and 19, and 25 percent had at least some college experience. By 2011, the teenage composition had fallen to 12 percent, while over 43 percent of low-wage workers had spent at least some time in college. Even among those earning no more than the federal minimum wage of $7.25 in 2011, less than a quarter were teenagers.
Support for increasing the minimum wage stretches across the political spectrum. As Larry M. Bartels, a political scientist at Vanderbilt, shows in his book "Unequal Democracy," support in surveys for increasing the minimum wage averaged between 60 and 70 percent between 1965 and 1975. As the minimum wage eroded relative to other wages and the cost of living, and inequality soared, Mr. Bartels found that the level of support rose to about 80 percent. He also demonstrates that reminding the respondents about possible negative consequences like job losses or price increases does not substantially diminish their support.
These patterns show up in recent survey data as well, as over three-quarters of Americans, including a solid majority of Republicans, say they support raising the minimum wage to either $9 or $10.10 an hour. It is therefore not a surprise that when they have been given a choice, voters in red and blue states alike have consistently supported, by wide margins, initiatives to raise the minimum wage. In 2004, 71 percent of Florida voters opted to raise and inflation-index the minimum wage, which today stands at $7.79 per hour. That same year, 68 percent of Nevadans voted to raise and index their minimum wage, which is now $8.25 for employees without health benefits. Since 1998, 10 states have put minimum wage increases on the ballot; voters have approved them every time.
But the popularity of minimum wages has not translated into legislative success on the federal level. Interest group pressure -- especially from the restaurant lobby -- has been one factor. Ironically, the very popularity of minimum wages may also have contributed to the failure to automatically index the minimum wage to inflation: Democratic legislators often prefer to increase the wage themselves since it allows them to win more political points. While 11 states currently index the minimum wage, only one, Vermont, did so legislatively; the rest were through ballot measures.
As a result of legislative inaction, inflation-adjusted minimum wages in the United States have declined in both absolute and relative terms for most of the past four decades. The high-water mark for the minimum wage was 1968, when it stood at $10.60 an hour in today's dollars, or 55 percent of the median full-time wage. In contrast, the current federal minimum wage is $7.25 an hour, constituting 37 percent of the median full-time wage. In other words, if we want to get the minimum wage back to 55 percent of the median full-time wage, we would need to raise it to $10.78 an hour.
International comparisons also show how out of line our current policy is: the United States has the third lowest minimum wage relative to the median of all Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries. This erosion of the minimum wage has been an important contributor to wage inequality, especially for women. While there is some disagreement about exact magnitudes, the evidence suggests that around half of the increase in inequality in the bottom half of the wage distribution since 1979 was a result of falling real minimum wages. And unlike inequality that stems from factors like technological change, this growth in inequality was clearly avoidable. All we had to do to prevent it was index the minimum wage to the cost of living.
The social benefits of minimum wages from reduced inequality have to be weighed against possible costs. When it comes to minimum wages, the primary concern is about jobs. The worry comes from basic supply and demand: When labor is made more costly, employers will hire less of it. It's a valid concern, but what does the evidence show?
For the type of minimum wage increases we have implemented in the United States, the best evidence shows that the impact on jobs is small, although there is still a debate in the literature. There are estimates that do suggest job losses -- most prominently associated with work by the economists David Neumark and William Wascher. Since the early 1990s, they have consistently argued that minimum wage increases lead to substantial job losses for low-wage workers: a 10 percent increase in the minimum wage can be expected to reduce jobs among a group like teenagers by between 1 and 3 percent. The methodology pioneered by Mr. Neumark and Mr. Wascher has a critical problem, however: it does not properly account for differences between high- and low-minimum-wage states. Essentially, they make the unrealistic assumption that low-wage employment trajectories are similar in states as diverse as Texas and Massachusetts.
As my colleagues and I show in our research, the states raising minimum wages have had very different trajectories when it comes to trends in demand conditions and business cycle variability. In fact, low-wage employment was often already falling (or growing more slowly) in the states raising the minimum wage -- sometimes years before the actual wage increase. Such divergence in trends between the "treatment" and "control" groups is a telltale sign that the control group is being constructed improperly -- a major issue for evaluating policies using nonexperimental evidence, otherwise known as real life.
The good news is that today we have much better tools in our toolbox. A particularly reliable methodology compares adjacent counties that are right across the state border but that experience different minimum wage shocks. Originally performed for a single case study of Pennsylvania and New Jersey by the economists David Card and Alan B. Krueger in 1994 and then again in 2000, this methodology has been substantially refined and expanded.
In my work with T. William Lester and Michael Reich, we use nearly two decades' worth of data and compare all bordering areas in the United States to show that while higher minimum wages raise earnings of low-wage workers, they do not have a detectable impact on employment. Our estimates -- published in 2010 in the Review of Economics and Statistics -- suggest that a hypothetical 10 percent increase in the minimum wage affects employment in the restaurant or retail industries, by much less than 1 percent; the change is in fact statistically indistinguishable from zero.
In my most recent work with Sylvia Allegretto, Ben Zipperer and Michael Reich, we confirm these results using four data sets covering over two decades, other low-wage groups like teenagers, and five different statistical techniques, including an increasingly popular method that uses past economic trends to construct a "synthetic" control group. And other researchers have independently reached the same conclusion: minimum wage effects on employment are small.
While the evidence may not convince the most strident of critics, it has shifted views among economists. A panel of 41 leading economists was asked recently by the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business to weigh in on President Obama's proposal to increase the minimum wage and automatically index it to inflation. A plurality, 47 percent, supported the policy, and only 11 percent opposed it, while the rest were uncertain or had no opinion. Only a third thought that the raise "would make it noticeably harder for low-skilled workers to find employment."
But how can minimum wages rise without causing job losses? For starters, if the demand for burgers is not price sensitive, some of the cost increase can be passed on to customers without substantially reducing demand or jobs. Existing research suggests that if you raise the minimum wage by 10 percent, you can expect the price of a $3 burger to rise by a few cents, which is enough to absorb a sizable part of the wage increase.
Going beyond simple supply and demand, economic models are getting better at incorporating frictions caused by the costs of finding jobs and filling vacancies, which turn out to be quite important when analyzing labor markets. There are good jobs and bad jobs at the low end of the labor market, and movements between these lead to vacancies and turnover. If McDonald's is required to pay a higher wage, fewer of its workers will leave to take other jobs. This means fewer vacancies at McDonald's, and it means other employers are more likely to fill their job openings from the ranks of the unemployed -- both of which can help keep unemployment down. So while higher costs may dissuade some employers from creating new positions, it also helps other employers recruit and retain workers. Moderate increases in the minimum wage, in other words, can reduce vacancies and turnover instead of killing jobs. In a follow-up study using our bordering areas methodology, we provide empirical evidence for this argument: while overall employment in low-wage sectors does not change much following a minimum-wage increase, worker turnover falls sharply as workers stay with their jobs longer.
But even if minimum wage policies reduce inequality and improve the functioning of low-wage labor markets, are there better alternatives when it comes to helping low-income families?
In a forthcoming study commissioned by the Department of Labor, I review the evidence using data from the past two decades and find clear evidence that minimum wage raises have helped lift family incomes at the bottom: a 10 percent increase in the minimum wage reduces poverty by around 2 percent.
The minimum wage can also increase the efficacy of a policy that is sometimes pushed as a substitute: the earned-income tax credit. This encourages more people to seek work, but can push wages down; a minimum wage ameliorates this. Of course, many families under the poverty line simply have no workers, making any work-based policy of limited help. This is why raising and indexing the minimum wage is just a part of the portfolio of policies we need to enact to ensure a decent living standard.
What are actual policy options when it comes to raising the minimum wage? At the federal level, the legislation proposed by Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, and Representative George Miller, Democrat of California, would raise the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour, and index it to future cost of living increases. This is a sensible target that would be likely to put the minimum wage right around 50 percent of the median wage for full-time workers -- close to the international standard and our own norm during the 1960s and '70s. Indexation is critical -- it replaces politics with economics as the adjustment mechanism and makes changes predictable. This is why even economists opposed to higher minimum wages support indexation.
Other policies can complement the federal minimum wage in building higher wage standards. City and state minimum wages play an important role in ensuring that places with higher costs of living have similarly higher wage standards. A number of cities have instituted "living wage" ordinances covering public sector workers and private city contractors. The most expansive of these ordinances cover major airports, like in the metropolitan areas of San Francisco, Los Angeles and most recently Seattle. Fast food workers in urban centers are beginning to organize and push for substantially higher voluntary wage standards at major chains. Together with a sensible federal minimum wage, these local initiatives can help rebuild wage standards and reduce inequality in a way that reflects our internal sense of fairness.

And unlike inequality that stems from factors like technological change, this growth in inequality was clearly avoidable. All we had to do to prevent it was index the minimum wage to the cost of living.
The social benefits of minimum wages from reduced inequality have to be weighed against possible costs. When it comes to minimum wages, the primary concern is about jobs. The worry comes from basic supply and demand: When labor is made more costly, employers will hire less of it. It's a valid concern, but what does the evidence show?
For the type of minimum wage increases we have implemented in the United States, the best evidence shows that the impact on jobs is small, although there is still a debate in the literature. There are estimates that do suggest job losses -- most prominently associated with work by the economists David Neumark and William Wascher. Since the early 1990s, they have consistently argued that minimum wage increases lead to substantial job losses for low-wage workers: a 10 percent increase in the minimum wage can be expected to reduce jobs among a group like teenagers by between 1 and 3 percent. The methodology pioneered by Mr. Neumark and Mr. Wascher has a critical problem, however: it does not properly account for differences between high- and low-minimum-wage states. Essentially, they make the unrealistic assumption that low-wage employment trajectories are similar in states as diverse as Texas and Massachusetts.
As my colleagues and I show in our research, the states raising minimum wages have had very different trajectories when it comes to trends in demand conditions and business cycle variability. In fact, low-wage employment was often already falling (or growing more slowly) in the states raising the minimum wage -- sometimes years before the actual wage increase. Such divergence in trends between the "treatment" and "control" groups is a telltale sign that the control group is being constructed improperly -- a major issue for evaluating policies using nonexperimental evidence, otherwise known as real life.
The good news is that today we have much better tools in our toolbox. A particularly reliable methodology compares adjacent counties that are right across the state border but that experience different minimum wage shocks. Originally performed for a single case study of Pennsylvania and New Jersey by the economists David Card and Alan B. Krueger in 1994 and then again in 2000, this methodology has been substantially refined and expanded.
In my work with T. William Lester and Michael Reich, we use nearly two decades' worth of data and compare all bordering areas in the United States to show that while higher minimum wages raise earnings of low-wage workers, they do not have a detectable impact on employment. Our estimates -- published in 2010 in the Review of Economics and Statistics -- suggest that a hypothetical 10 percent increase in the minimum wage affects employment in the restaurant or retail industries, by much less than 1 percent; the change is in fact statistically indistinguishable from zero.
In my most recent work with Sylvia Allegretto, Ben Zipperer and Michael Reich, we confirm these results using four data sets covering over two decades, other low-wage groups like teenagers, and five different statistical techniques, including an increasingly popular method that uses past economic trends to construct a "synthetic" control group. And other researchers have independently reached the same conclusion: minimum wage effects on employment are small.
While the evidence may not convince the most strident of critics, it has shifted views among economists. A panel of 41 leading economists was asked recently by the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business to weigh in on President Obama's proposal to increase the minimum wage and automatically index it to inflation. A plurality, 47 percent, supported the policy, and only 11 percent opposed it, while the rest were uncertain or had no opinion. Only a third thought that the raise "would make it noticeably harder for low-skilled workers to find employment."
But how can minimum wages rise without causing job losses? For starters, if the demand for burgers is not price sensitive, some of the cost increase can be passed on to customers without substantially reducing demand or jobs. Existing research suggests that if you raise the minimum wage by 10 percent, you can expect the price of a $3 burger to rise by a few cents, which is enough to absorb a sizable part of the wage increase.
Going beyond simple supply and demand, economic models are getting better at incorporating frictions caused by the costs of finding jobs and filling vacancies, which turn out to be quite important when analyzing labor markets. There are good jobs and bad jobs at the low end of the labor market, and movements between these lead to vacancies and turnover. If McDonald's is required to pay a higher wage, fewer of its workers will leave to take other jobs. This means fewer vacancies at McDonald's, and it means other employers are more likely to fill their job openings from the ranks of the unemployed -- both of which can help keep unemployment down. So while higher costs may dissuade some employers from creating new positions, it also helps other employers recruit and retain workers. Moderate increases in the minimum wage, in other words, can reduce vacancies and turnover instead of killing jobs. In a follow-up study using our bordering areas methodology, we provide empirical evidence for this argument: while overall employment in low-wage sectors does not change much following a minimum-wage increase, worker turnover falls sharply as workers stay with their jobs longer.
But even if minimum wage policies reduce inequality and improve the functioning of low-wage labor markets, are there better alternatives when it comes to helping low-income families?
In a forthcoming study commissioned by the Department of Labor, I review the evidence using data from the past two decades and find clear evidence that minimum wage raises have helped lift family incomes at the bottom: a 10 percent increase in the minimum wage reduces poverty by around 2 percent.
The minimum wage can also increase the efficacy of a policy that is sometimes pushed as a substitute: the earned-income tax credit. This encourages more people to seek work, but can push wages down; a minimum wage ameliorates this. Of course, many families under the poverty line simply have no workers, making any work-based policy of limited help. This is why raising and indexing the minimum wage is just a part of the portfolio of policies we need to enact to ensure a decent living standard.
What are actual policy options when it comes to raising the minimum wage? At the federal level, the legislation proposed by Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, and Representative George Miller, Democrat of California, would raise the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour, and index it to future cost of living increases. This is a sensible target that would be likely to put the minimum wage right around 50 percent of the median wage for full-time workers -- close to the international standard and our own norm during the 1960s and '70s. Indexation is critical -- it replaces politics with economics as the adjustment mechanism and makes changes predictable. This is why even economists opposed to higher minimum wages support indexation.
Other policies can complement the federal minimum wage in building higher wage standards. City and state minimum wages play an important role in ensuring that places with higher costs of living have similarly higher wage standards. A number of cities have instituted "living wage" ordinances covering public sector workers and private city contractors. The most expansive of these ordinances cover major airports, like in the metropolitan areas of San Francisco, Los Angeles and most recently Seattle. Fast food workers in urban centers are beginning to organize and push for substantially higher voluntary wage standards at major chains. Together with a sensible federal minimum wage, these local initiatives can help rebuild wage standards and reduce inequality in a way that reflects our internal sense of fairness.

Abstract: The budget office suggests giving smaller pay raises; replacing the current retirement system, under which active-duty members qualify for immediate benefits after 20 years of service, with a defined benefit system that partially vests earlier in a service member's career; and increasing health care enrollment fees, deductibles or co-payments.

Full text:   Big-ticket weapons like aircraft carriers and the F-35 fighter jet have to be part of any conversation about cutting Pentagon spending to satisfy the mandatory budget reductions known as the sequester. But compensation for military personnel has to be on the table, too -- even though no other defense issue is more politically volatile or emotionally fraught.
After a decade of war, the very idea of cutting benefits to soldiers, sailors and Marines who put their lives on the line seems ungrateful. But America's involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan is over or winding down, and the Pentagon is obliged to find nearly $1 trillion in savings over 10 years. Tough choices will be required in all parts of the budget. Compensation includes pay, retirement benefits, health care and housing allowances. It consumes about half the military budget, and it is increasing.
In a speech last month, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel warned that without serious savings in this area, "we risk becoming an unbalanced force, one that is well compensated but poorly trained and equipped, with limited readiness and capability." Meanwhile, Gen. Ray Odierno, the Army chief of staff, told a hearing: "The cost of a soldier has doubled since 2001; it's going to almost double again by 2025. We can't go on like this, so we have to come up with [new] compensation packages."
The Wall Street Journal reported recently that military commanders have agreed to a plan that would curb the growth of pay and benefits for housing, education and health. But it must still be approved by Mr. Hagel and President Obama. In past years, Congress has approved pay raises and benefit improvements and resisted rollbacks. It is possible that politically savvy Pentagon leaders may be hitting the personnel issue hard right now to force lawmakers to end the sequester or to otherwise soften its blow to the overall military budget. Personnel costs are not the only ones rising. Weapons procurement has risen 88 percent from 2001 to 2012.
But many Washington-based think tanks, spanning all ideologies, are also pushing reform. In June, a group of them -- including the conservative American Enterprise Institute and the liberal Center for American Progress -- called for a comprehensive review and modernization of the military compensation system, which has been largely unchanged for 40 years.
One problem is that unrestrained compensation costs will edge out funds for training, readiness and weapons. A recent Congressional Budget Office study said that between 2001 and 2012, when private-sector wages were effectively flat, basic military pay rose by 28 percent in inflation-adjusted dollars. The study also said that cash compensation for enlisted personnel, including food and housing allowances, is greater than the wages and salaries of 90 percent of their civilian counterparts. And health care costs are projected to rise from $51 billion in 2013 to $77 billion by 2022.
Where, then, to cut? Reducing the size of the armed forces would have the quickest effect. The budget office suggests giving smaller pay raises; replacing the current retirement system, under which active-duty members qualify for immediate benefits after 20 years of service, with a defined benefit system that partially vests earlier in a service member's career; and increasing health care enrollment fees, deductibles or co-payments. Military retirees pay only a fraction of what civilians pay for health care premiums, and those with second careers often choose to stay on the government plan. It makes sense that they be asked to assume a greater share. To the extent possible, any changes should affect future recruits rather than current enlistees.
Soldiers must be adequately compensated. But when programs across the government are being slashed, including those affecting the most vulnerable Americans, no budget account can be immune from reductions and reforms. It is a difficult balance to get right.

Full text:   The law establishing Obamacare was officially titled the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. And the "affordable" bit wasn't just about subsidizing premiums. It was also supposed to be about "bending the curve" -- slowing the seemingly inexorable rise in health costs.
Much of the Beltway establishment scoffed at the promise of cost savings. The prevalent attitude in Washington is that reform isn't real unless the little people suffer; serious savings are supposed to come from things like raising the Medicare age (which the Congressional Budget Office recently concluded would, in fact, hardly save any money) and throwing millions of Americans off Medicaid. True, a 2011 letter signed by hundreds of health and labor economists pointed out that "the Affordable Care Act contains essentially every cost-containment provision policy analysts have considered effective in reducing the rate of medical spending." But such expert views were largely ignored.
So, how's it going? The health exchanges are off to a famously rocky start, but many, though by no means all, of the cost-control measures have already kicked in. Has the curve been bent?
The answer, amazingly, is yes. In fact, the slowdown in health costs has been dramatic.
O.K., the obligatory caveats. First of all, we don't know how long the good news will last. Health costs in the United States slowed dramatically in the 1990s (although not this dramatically), probably thanks to the rise of health maintenance organizations, but cost growth picked up again after 2000. Second, we don't know for sure how much of the good news is because of the Affordable Care Act.
Still, the facts are striking. Since 2010, when the act was passed, real health spending per capita -- that is, total spending adjusted for overall inflation and population growth -- has risen less than a third as rapidly as its long-term average. Real spending per Medicare recipient hasn't risen at all; real spending per Medicaid beneficiary has actually fallen slightly.
What could account for this good news? One obvious answer is the still-depressed economy, which might be causing people to forgo expensive medical care. But this explanation turns out to be problematic in multiple ways. For one thing, the economy had stabilized by 2010, even if the recovery was fairly weak, yet health costs continued to slow. For another, it's hard to see why a weak economy would have more effect in reducing the prices of health services than it has on overall inflation. Finally, Medicare spending shouldn't be affected by the weak economy, yet it has slowed even more dramatically than private spending.
A better story focuses on what appears to be a decline in some kinds of medical innovation -- in particular, an absence of expensive new blockbuster drugs, even as existing drugs go off-patent and can be replaced with cheaper generic brands. This is a real phenomenon; it is, in fact, the main reason the Medicare drug program has ended up costing less than originally projected. But since drugs are only about 10 percent of health spending, it can only explain so much.
So what aspects of Obamacare might be causing health costs to slow? One clear answer is the act's reduction in Medicare "overpayments" -- mainly a reduction in the subsidies to private insurers offering Medicare Advantage Plans, but also cuts in some provider payments. A less certain but likely source of savings involves changes in the way Medicare pays for services. The program now penalizes hospitals if many of their patients end up being readmitted soon after being released -- an indicator of poor care -- and readmission rates have, in fact, fallen substantially. Medicare is also encouraging a shift from fee-for-service, in which doctors and hospitals get paid by the procedure, to "accountable care," in which health organizations get rewarded for overall success in improving care while controlling costs.
Furthermore, there's evidence that Medicare savings "spill over" to the rest of the health care system -- that when Medicare manages to slow cost growth, private insurance gets cheaper, too.
And the biggest savings may be yet to come. The Independent Payment Advisory Board, a panel with the power to impose cost-saving measures (subject to Congressional overrides) if Medicare spending grows above target, hasn't yet been established, in part because of the near-certainty that any appointments to the board would be filibustered by Republicans yelling about "death panels." Now that the filibuster has been reformed, the board can come into being.
The news on health costs is, in short, remarkably good. You won't hear much about this good news until and unless the Obamacare website gets fixed. But under the surface, health reform is starting to look like a bigger success than even its most ardent advocates expected.

Full text:   The stock market paused on Monday, ending with little change after a string of records in recent weeks.
Investors had little company-specific news to digest and trading was light ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday. Still, the market felt the impact of broader geopolitical news; oil prices and energy stocks fell after the United States and other world powers reached a deal on Sunday to limit Iran's nuclear program.
The slow day represented a lull in the market's strong run-up. Stocks have climbed this year as a combination of solid corporate earnings, a strengthening economy and easy-money policies from the Federal Reserve have drawn investors to stocks. Equities have also gained because they offer an attractive alternative to bonds, where interest rates remain close to record lows.
Despite light trade, Monday did feature a market milestone. The Nasdaq composite index rose as high as 4,007.09, a level it has not touched since Sept. 7, 2000, toward the end of the dot-com boom. The Nasdaq ended up 2.92 points, or less than 0.1 percent, at 3,994.57.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 7.77 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 16,072.54.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, however, fell 2.28 points, or 0.13 percent, to 1,802.48. On Friday, the S.&P. 500 closed above 1,800 for the first time.
The biggest drags on the S.&P. 500 were energy stocks. Sunday's deal with Iran could increase global oil supplies by making it easier for Iran to sell its crude on the global market. That could push oil prices lower in the long term.
Crude oil fell 75 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $94.09.
In turn, energy companies including Halliburton, Transocean and Schlumberger all fell 2 percent or more.
Even with Monday's slight decline, the S.&P. 500 has risen seven straight weeks and is up 26.4 percent in 2013, its best performance in 15 years.
But an increasing number of investors believe that stocks have run their course for 2013 and are due for a pullback soon. "I would like to see this market take a breather," said James P. Lauder, a fund manager for Wells Fargo Advantage Dow Jones Target Date Funds.
While the Nasdaq is flirting with territory it hasn't seen in 13 years, the index is still down roughly 25 percent, not adjusted for inflation, from its record high of 5,048.62, set on March 10, 2000. The Nasdaq, although still technology-heavy, is dominated by highly profitable companies.
Trading was light on Monday and is expected to remain limited all week. Stock and bond markets are closed on Thursday in observance of Thanksgiving. On Friday, the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq will close early.
Approximately 2.98 billion shares traded hands on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday, below the 3.35 billion that is typically traded on an average day.
Among the stocks on the move, Wal-Mart Stores rose 62 cents, or 0.78 percent, to $80.43, after the company said its chief executive was stepping down.
Alcoa climbed 35 cents, or 3.79 percent, to $9.59, after Goldman Sachs upgraded the company to buy from neutral, citing potential growth in its aluminum products business.
DaVita HealthCare Partners, the dialysis services provider, shot up $5.01, or 8.86 percent, to $61.55, after saying that Medicare reimbursement rates would not be cut next year as analysts had expected.
In the bond market, interest rates eased modestly. The yield on the Treasury's 10-year note slipped to 2.73 percent, from 2.75 percent late Friday, while its price rose 3/32, to 100 5/32.

Full text:   SHOPPING SEASON Thanksgiving week is one of the biggest and busiest weeks of the year for retailers. More than 139 million people shopped from Thursday through Sunday of Thanksgiving week last year, according to the National Retail Federation. Traditionally, the holiday shopping season begins on Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving, but this year many retailers will be open and offering deals on Thanksgiving Day, including Macy's, J. C. Penney and Toys 'R' Us.
AIRLINE BANKRUPTCY A federal bankruptcy judge is scheduled to rule Monday on when American Airlines can leave bankruptcy, after examining the recent settlement reached between the Department of Justice and American Airlines and US Airways over their planned merger. Judge Sean H. Lane, of the United States Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan, must decide whether the settlement was a big enough change to the plan of reorganization to warrant a new vote by the airline's creditors and shareholders. If the judge confirms the plan, the ruling would pave the way for the carrier's emergence from bankruptcy within a few weeks.
H.P. EARNINGS Hewlett-Packard is expected to deliver earnings below last year's levels, as the company's chief executive, Meg Whitman, completes what she has called a turnaround year. Growth is expected in 2014, as the onetime leader in personal computers copes with an onslaught of smartphones and tablets, and competition from Lenovo and Dell. Analysts will be looking for clues about H.P.'s success in bringing to market new styles of laptops, and inroads it is able to make in advanced computer systems integration. It won't show up in this report, but H.P. got a lift on the computing infrastructure front when it announced a deal with Salesforce.com, a leader in cloud computing.
EURO INFLATION On Friday, the European Union statistics agency will publish the latest inflation figures for the euro zone. After inflation in October fell more than expected to an annual rate of 0.7 percent, a further fall in November could heighten fears that the euro zone is at risk of deflation, a pernicious downward spiral of prices. A further drop would also put pressure on the European Central Bank to do more to stimulate growth, perhaps even by breaking a taboo on central bank asset purchases. Euro zone unemployment figures will also be released Friday, and are expected to show joblessness stuck at 12.2 percent.
HEALTH CARE WEBSITE The Obama administration had set Sunday as the deadline for fixing the myriad problems with the federal health insurance website, but in recent days officials have gradually tried to lower expectations about how well the site would work. In testimony last week the chief digital architect for the federal exchange said 30 percent to 40 percent of the project was still being built. The official, Henry Chao, made the assessment before a panel of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Lawmakers expressed surprise that so much work remained to be done seven weeks after the federal website opened to the public. Mr. Chao, the deputy chief information officer at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said the government was still working on "back office systems," including those needed to pay insurance companies that are supposed to provide coverage to millions of people under President Obama's health care law. Mr. Chao said the government had largely completed computer systems that were most important to consumers and allowed them to apply for insurance, compare health plans and enroll. However, White House officials said that even these parts of the system were still being repaired and were not performing as well as they had hoped. Kathleen Sebelius, secretary of Health and Human Services, also was playing down the federal government's self-imposed deadline. "The 30th of November is not a magic go, no-go date," Ms. Sebelius told The Associated Press.

Full text:   TEHRAN -- The smiling started early in Tehran on Sunday, when President Hassan Rouhani kissed a young schoolgirl in an Islamic head scarf before dozens of cameras, signaling that Iran's future had taken a new turn.
After years of seemingly endless bad tidings of more international sanctions, more inflation and more saber rattling, many in this capital received the news of the first nuclear agreement between Iran and world powers in more than a decade like an awakening from a bad dream, and they shared their emotions on social media.
"When I checked my Instagram when I woke up, someone had posted a picture of an Iranian and American flag," said Asal Khalilpour, 29. "After I read the comments saying a deal was made, tears started rolling down my cheeks of happiness. I couldn't believe it."
People from across the Iranian political spectrum, including many hard-line commanders and clerics who had long advocated resistance and isolation from the West, told state news media on Sunday that the deal that Mr. Rouhani's negotiating team had made was a good start.
One man's nay could have undone it all. But Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has been working for some time to engineer a way out of the economic and diplomatic quagmire of sanctions. Soon after Mr. Rouhani spoke to reporters, Ayatollah Khamenei issued a short message online saying he considered the deal a success.
"The nuclear negotiating team deserves to be appreciated and thanked for its achievement," Ayatollah Khamenei said, according to the semiofficial Fars News Agency. He added that "their behavior can be the basis of the next wise measures."
Ayatollah Khamenei had spoken of negotiating directly with "the great Satan," the Iranian ideological label for the United States, as long ago as March, three months before Mr. Rouhani was elected president promising better relations with the West. "I am not opposed," Ayatollah Khamenei said on the subject during his annual address on the first day of the Iranian year, March 21. "But first the Americans must change their hostility towards Iran."
At the time, few observers thought the remark, made amid a flurry of verbal attacks on the United States, reflected a serious change in policy. But Ayatollah Khamenei apparently allowed a group of Iranian diplomats to begin secret preparatory talks with American officials in Oman, according to an Associated Press report citing American officials. He also assured that the next president of Iran would follow a line different from the prickly hostility of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, whose comments about Israel and the Holocaust had helped make Iran a pariah.
"It is clear that any international outreach could not be handled by someone like President Ahmadinejad," said Amir Mohebbian, a political strategist who advises Iranian leaders and is often briefed on Iran's relations with America. "I think the leader helped bring Mr. Rouhani to power to make the public ready for a policy change."
Noting the long friendship between Ayatollah Khamenei and Mr. Rouhani, a career diplomat, Mr. Mohebbian said that "nobody is better suited to bring Iran back to the world community than Mr. Rouhani." He compared the handling of the talks to a construction project, with Ayatollah Khamenei as the architect and Mr. Rouhani as the contractor executing the design. "The leader has shaped this situation and paved the way for Mr. Rouhani to be the right person at the right time," Mr. Mohebbian said
Others in Tehran said they had had inklings of what was coming. "Rumors of secret talks started circulating in Tehran in March," said Nader Karimi Joni, a journalist and commentator close to Mr. Rouhani's administration. Mr. Joni said he had heard the rumors from someone in the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, and that although he could not confirm them at the time, "later it became clear the leader had sent trusted aides, instead of people close to Ahmadinejad, to conduct the talks."
One man who was widely thought to have been involved was Ali Akbar Salehi, a foreign minister under Mr. Ahmadinejad who now heads the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran. Asked on Sunday about secret negotiations in Oman, Mr. Salehi appeared surprised; he smiled and said, "You must understand that I cannot comment on this right now."
In the early hours of Monday, an Iranian Foreign Ministry official denied the Associated Press report about secret bilateral talks, the state-controlled Islamic Republic News Agency reported. The agency said the official, whom it did not name, warned the news media against publishing reports that "would create ambiguity over Iran's clear-cut stances."
Whether Tehran's change of heart about a deal with the West grew from the pain Iran felt from sanctions or a new strategic calculation about its nuclear program, one factor appears to have been the Obama administration's publicly stated desire to resolve the issues related to the Iranian nuclear program.
Ayatollah Khamenei said in March that "the Americans constantly send us messages, telling us they are sincere." Though the leader dismissed them in his speech as a public relations tactic, Mr. Mohebbian said, letters that Mr. Obama had sent to Ayatollah Khamenei "created the start of a better atmosphere," and Ayatollah Khamenei responded.
After the country's Guardian Council, which vets prospective candidates, decided on the field for the presidential race, Mr. Rouhani emerged as the only candidate who was not considered a hard-liner like Mr. Ahmadinejad. Dissatisfied middle-class Iranians who felt alienated by the intrusive security state that Iran had become flocked to Mr. Rouhani's standard, and he won the election comfortably without a runoff.
"I am so happy I voted for Mr. Rouhani at the time," Sajad Motaharnia, a student of English, said on Sunday as he watched a news broadcast about the nuclear agreement, which was given extensive coverage on state television. "But I'm also sad when I think how we have lived under pressure for the past 10 years because of the bad decisions of some politicians."
Mr. Rouhani himself seemed to want to draw a line under the past, by bringing the families of Iranian nuclear scientists who were killed in recent years to his news briefing on Sunday; the schoolgirl he kissed for the cameras was the daughter of one of them, Darioush Rezai-Nejad.
Some opposition to the agreement was evident on Sunday among Iranian hard-liners. The Raja News website quoted several lawmakers warning that Parliament had the power under the country's Constitution to ratify or reject the agreement, and that they were dissatisfied with several elements of it.
One well-known hard-liner, Hamid-Reza Taraghi, an official interpreter of Ayatollah Khamenei's speeches, was among the skeptics, saying he was disappointed that the deal did not call for the lifting of all sanctions.
He dismissed the notion that Ayatollah Khamenei had approved secret talks between Iran and the United States. "What is clear is that the supreme leader did not agree with the way the previous negotiating team operated," Mr. Taraghi said, referring to the Ahmadinejad administration. "But bear in mind that Ayatollah Khamenei is honest and does not believe in duplicity in politics."

Full text:   Updated, 3:13 p.m. | When Pedro Lantigua, a 32-year-old truck driver from Oklahoma City, decided to trade in his vehicle last summer, he walked into his local dealership and drove off with a brand-new Chevrolet Silverado. Like millions of Americans, he agreed to a loan arranged by the dealer.
Unlike most buyers, Mr. Lantigua actually knows how much he spent on that service, but only because the details came out when he sued the dealer for breach of contract related to his trade-in.
Mr. Lantigua agreed to pay $609 a month, meaning he would own the truck in about six years. But Mr. Lantigua said he did not know that his 12.6 percent interest rate included about $1,000 for the dealership, David Stanley Chevrolet, which arranged Mr. Lantigua's loan through Ally Bank, according to Mr. Lantigua's lawyer, Kathi Rawls.
Dealers often arrange loans for car buyers through third-party lenders, providing something of a one-stop shop for about 80 percent of all consumers who need financing. Dealers can decide how much they want to charge for that service and tack their fee onto the lender's interest rate.
"Individual consumers usually don't even know that they've been marked up," said Rosemary Shahan, the president of Consumers for Auto Reliability and Safety, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group.
Dealerships are not required to disclose what percentage of the interest rate goes to them, and consumer advocates and some regulators are concerned that dealers' ability to decide how much to charge has led to discriminatory lending against minorities. That concern has prompted a number of government investigations into the growing business of auto lending. Auto loan originations increased in the third quarter, to $97.4 billion, the highest level since the third quarter of 2007, adjusted for inflation, according to a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. That rise has been matched by a strengthening market for securities backed by such loans.
Mr. Lantigua, who is Hispanic but is not accusing the dealership of discrimination, saw his loan documents only after filing his lawsuit. A lawyer for the dealership did not respond to requests for comment.
Dealer and consumer advocates disagree on just about every aspect of the dealer compensation process, including what these fees should even be called. Critics call them markups; lenders and others refer to them as dealer participations.
The National Automobile Dealers Association says franchise dealers typically do not charge more than 1 percent interest on average, a figure that it contends is fair compensation for acting as the middleman. The association also says that switching to a flat fee, one alternative suggested by consumer advocates, would only result in higher costs for car buyers.
But some consumer groups say that average fees range a bit higher, from 2 to 2.5 percent, depending on the terms -- differences that can add hundreds of dollars over several years.
Moreover, those consumer advocates and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau say that African-American, Asian and Hispanic borrowers often end up paying more than white borrowers with comparable credit backgrounds.
"In some cases, these disparities are significant," said Rohit Chopra, the acting assistant director for installment lending at the bureau. He said the bureau had found differences of 10 to 30 basis points at some financial institutions.
Dealers are also likely to charge higher fees for borrowers with weaker credit, according to a 2011 study from the Center for Responsible Lending. That practice can also single out minorities because "borrowers of color are disproportionately represented in the subprime market," said Chris Kukla, senior vice president at the Center for Responsible Lending.
At stake are billions of dollars in fees on more than $700 billion in outstanding auto loans. The consumer protection bureau says that it has found tens of millions of dollars in disparities between minority and white car buyers.
The issue of whether those fees violate fair-lending rules has now been taken up by the Justice Department. A senior official, Steven H. Rosenbaum, chief of the housing and civil enforcement section, disclosed during an industry trade forum last week that the department was in the middle of a number of joint investigations with the consumer bureau about auto loans.
The investigations center on whether dealers have violated the Equal Credit Opportunities Act, which prohibits credit discrimination based on minority, religious or other protected statuses.
The consumer protection bureau upset many in the auto industry in March when it issued a bulletin that said lenders could be held responsible for pricing disparities made by the dealerships with which they do business.
But pinpointing exactly where that discrimination is taking place is a challenge. The consumer protection bureau does not have access to information on individual consumers to determine factors like sex and ethnicity. Instead, it must rely on small bits of information, like part of a borrower's name, to make some general assumptions about ethnicity and credit quality.
"We can't measure the amount of discrimination because the data's just not available to us," Mr. Kukla said. Consumer advocates also point to several class-action settlements from the mid-2000s that found that African-Americans and Hispanics often paid more for auto loans than white borrowers. Such class actions are more difficult today, they say, because most car contracts now include arbitration clauses and other legal limitations.
That lack of specificity is a big problem for people in the auto industry, who say that such surveying practices fail to consider other more "neutral" factors that affect loans, like the type of vehicle being purchased. A bipartisan group of senators also raised some concerns over the methodology in a letter they issued to the bureau last month. "Our hope is that they will reveal the full methodology they're using to come to that conclusion so that we can assess whether there's any issue here at all," said Paul D. Metrey, the chief regulatory counsel in the auto association's financial services, privacy and tax division.
Ally Bank, one of the nation's largest auto lenders with $9.6 billion in loans as of last quarter, recently disclosed it was under investigation by the consumer protection bureau, which the bank said had warned it of its failure to prevent discrimination among its partner dealers.
"Ally does not condone discriminatory lending practices," a bank spokeswoman said in an email. "We have implemented a dealer monitoring program and if discriminatory behavior is suspected, there is a plan in place to address it."
Loans made to subprime borrowers can also prove problematic. Subprime borrowers with markups have a greater chance of losing their car or falling behind on payments than prime borrowers with markups, according to the Center for Responsible Lending.
Scrutiny on these types of loans has gained urgency in the aftermath of the financial crisis, which underscored the risks of subprime lending. Like subprime mortgages, some subprime auto loans can be bundled, sliced and sold as securities.
Mr. Metrey and consumer advocates do agree on one thing: Consumers should shop around for loans before they walk into a dealership.
"The main defense for someone is to come in with multiple offers," Mr. Kukla said. "And even then, it's not foolproof."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text:   There's an old Gospel song called "Trouble Don't Last Always." My mother has repeated that phrase so often that the words are written on my consciousness.
The lesson of that saying is always with me: Though your problems may be present, they are not permanent. Storms pass.
That's why I have grown weary of the Democratic gnashing of teeth over the problems with the Obamacare rollout and the president's falling poll numbers.
Panic lacks perspective.
This situation should remind us of a few things:
Although we like to think of nearly everyone as ardently right or left, a significant portion of the electorate is closer to the middle. An October Esquire-NBC News poll put the number of American moderates as high as 51 percent of the population. Many of these people can swing one way or another based on the news of the day or the season.
As much as people like to talk about the Republican Party's being in its death throes, the party is still very much alive. Things don't like to die. They change. That change may be slow and hard, but as death draws near, change is often forced. The Republican Party cannot sustain itself as a nationally viable party on its current path, but Republicans will eventually figure that out and a charismatic conservative will be able to sell the change.
Change is hard and often messy, and a movement and a messenger -- the progressive cause and this president -- whose whole identities are about change will always be linked to any discomfort that change brings.
You can't promise more than you can produce. When the president told people they could keep their doctors and current insurance plans and that turned out not to be true, that hurt his standing more than any issue with the website ever could. To most people, that sounds dishonest, and dishonesty is an easily understood and widely reviled trait.
Republicans are going to harp on Obamacare and highlight hardship stories for as long as they feel the story has legs -- and that may be a while. That happens in politics. You give your opponents a stick, and they'll whack you with it every time.
That being said, this is not the end of days for this president or his party -- no more so than shutting down the government was the end of the Republican Party.
Here is what we must remember:
Obamacare is, in the end, good for America. A report this week from the Council of Economic Advisers found that since 2010, when the Affordable Care Act passed, "Health care spending is the lowest on record," and, "Health care price inflation is at its lowest rate in 50 years." The report also said that the law has "substantially improved the long-term federal budget outlook."
Not only must we lower health care costs so that they don't bankrupt us; we must improve our health care system, something that Obamacare aims to do. Right now, we spend more than any other country on health care and still don't have the best health outcomes. To quote from a PBS NewsHour report last year, in the United States:
There are fewer physicians per person than in most other Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries.
The number of hospital beds in the U.S. was 2.6 per 1,000 population in 2009, lower than the O.E.C.D. average of 3.4 beds.
Life expectancy at birth increased by almost nine years between 1960 and 2010, but that's less than the increase of over 15 years in Japan and over 11 years on average in O.E.C.D. countries.
Fixing our health care system is not only right from a budget and policy perspective; it's morally right. No one should be turned down for health coverage because of pre-existing conditions. No one should have to live in fear of going broke from getting sick. No one should have to use emergency rooms as his or her only option. As Martin Luther King Jr. once put it, "Of all the forms of inequality, injustice in health care is the most shocking and inhumane."
Every policy change -- particularly large ones -- will have winners and losers. For now, the Republicans will keep highlighting the losers. Democrats must keep highlighting the winners, while reminding people that data points are not the data set. In the end, this health care law will be judged by its overall effects on the population and the economy, which I wager will be a net positive.
Anger is exhausting. It eventually subsides, memories fade and the media turn away to chase another ambulance.
As my mother would say, "Trouble don't last always."

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve's campaign to encourage economic growth was bolstered on Thursday as Janet L. Yellen moved to the verge of confirmation as the next head of the Fed, and a change in Senate procedures made it easier for the White House to fill three other vacancies on the Fed's board.
The Senate Banking Committee sent Ms. Yellen's nomination to the full Senate on Thursday morning by a vote of 14-8. This margin, unusually small compared with those for past nominees to lead the Fed, reflected the depth of partisan divisions over the central bank's five-year-old campaign to increase the pace of economic growth.
Still, Ms. Yellen's confirmation to a four-year term -- and the distinction of becoming the first woman to lead the Fed -- is virtually assured after the Senate changed its rules a few hours later to require only 51 votes to confirm most presidential nominees, meaning Ms. Yellen does not need Republican support.
The full Senate is expected to vote after Thanksgiving.
The rules change also will make it easier for the White House to fill three other seats on the Fed's seven-member board of governors with nominees likely to share Ms. Yellen's commitment to pressing ahead with the Fed's stimulus campaign.
Lael Brainard, until recently the Treasury under secretary for international affairs, is a front-runner for one of the vacancies, according to people briefed on the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the process. The administration has a short list of candidates for the other two positions, those people said. There is a sense of urgency because Ms. Yellen has relatively few strong allies among the existing Fed officials who will serve next year as voting members of the Fed's policy-making committee.
The White House also plans to avoid a fourth vacancy by nominating to a new term the Republican financier Jerome H. Powell, who joined the board last year.
Ms. Yellen, 67, has been the Fed's vice chairwoman since 2010 and has worked closely with the current Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, to shape the Fed's expansive efforts to revive the economy and reduce unemployment and to build support for them. Colleagues and analysts regard her as a stronger supporter and more forceful proponent of those policies than Mr. Bernanke, although the difference is modest.
Fed officials are debating how much longer to continue with the most controversial portion of the stimulus program, the monthly addition of $85 billion in Treasury and mortgage-backed securities to a pile of holdings that has ballooned to more than $3.9 trillion since the start of the financial crisis.
Ms. Yellen has avoided public comment in recent months, save for a few hours of carefully prepared remarks at her confirmation hearing, but she has continued to call privately for the Fed to press ahead with the purchases.
She said at her confirmation hearing that the purchases were yielding clear economic benefits and that it was not yet clear that a recent increase in the pace of job creation would continue without the Fed's support. "I consider it imperative that we do what we can to promote a very strong recovery," she said.
The vote on Ms. Yellen's nomination divided the banking committee largely along party lines, but she managed to win the support of three Republican senators: Bob Corker of Tennessee, Mark Kirk of Illinois and Tom Coburn of Oklahoma. She also lost one Democrat, Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia.
Senate Democrats pressed the White House to nominate Ms. Yellen instead of Lawrence H. Summers, formerly the president's chief economic adviser, in part because they regarded her as more likely to press ahead with the Fed's stimulus campaign. Her opponents have focused primarily on the same issue, describing the campaign as ineffective and potentially costly. Critics argue the bond-buying is disrupting financial markets, encouraging speculation and seeding inflation.
"Dr. Yellen is a very intelligent and capable nominee, but her views and beliefs to continue quantitative easing, despite a failure to see any real gains, greatly troubles me," Mr. Manchin, who is running for re-election in a conservative state, said in a statement after Thursday's vote.
The Republican senators who voted for Ms. Yellen said that they did so despite sharing those concerns. Mr. Coburn described Ms. Yellen as "obviously qualified," but added that he did not agree with her views.
Senator Heidi Heitkamp, a conservative Democrat from North Dakota who supported Ms. Yellen's nomination, said there was a "legitimate debate about the easy money policy of the Fed."
"This was a way for the committee members who aren't expressing an opinion about her qualifications but rather about the current policies at the Fed to push back," she added. "I think everyone in there expects that she's going to be confirmed on the floor, but they wanted to have a moment to express their disagreement with the Fed policy."
As a result of that opposition, Ms. Yellen is at real risk of being confirmed by a smaller margin than any of her predecessors. The previous low came just four years ago, when 70 senators voted to give Mr. Bernanke a second term.
Still, there is now little doubt that she will replace Mr. Bernanke on Feb. 1. The Fed's policy-making committee still has two scheduled meetings before that transition, in mid-December and late January, but there are already clear signs that the Fed is preparing for a relatively rare transition in leadership. Ms. Yellen would become just the fourth person to lead the Fed in the last 35 years.
Ms. Yellen mentioned Mr. Bernanke repeatedly during her confirmation hearing, sending a message of continuity in the Fed's approach to policy. Mr. Bernanke has done the same, citing Ms. Yellen by name at recent appearances.
"I agree with the sentiment expressed by my colleague Janet Yellen at her testimony last week," Mr. Bernanke said on Tuesday, "that the surest path to a more normal approach to monetary policy is to do all we can today to promote a more robust recovery."

Full text:   Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade (Thursday) Sometimes even balloons need a makeover. Snoopy, Woodstock and SpongeBob SquarePants will be sporting new looks as they float along with the other balloon characters, bands, clowns and marchers that are part of this year's 87th holiday spectacle.
A more traditional Snoopy -- minus the cap, cape and binoculars -- is on board, along with a Christmas-themed SpongeBob. Stars from two Cartoon Network shows will also make their debuts: Toothless from "DreamWorks Dragons" and Finn and Jake from "Adventure Time." Alas, Charlie Brown is sitting out this time to make room for Snoopy. (Only 15 giant balloons make the cut each year.)
The parade begins at 9 a.m. at Central Park West and 77th Street and heads south to Columbus Circle, where it turns east to Avenue of the Americas and travels to 34th Street, ending at Macy's in Herald Square. NBC will show the parade, with personalities from "Today" as hosts. For those who would like to see the balloons spring to life, inflation begins on Wednesday at 3 p.m. outside the American Museum of Natural History, with entry at Columbus Avenue and 79th Street. With these free events and the feast that follows, what could be a better way to usher in the holidays? (Anne Mancuso)

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve officials, many of them reluctant to continue the Fed's economic stimulus campaign in its current form, wrestled at their most recent meeting with other ways of supporting an economy that still needs help.
The discussions, described in the standard account of the meeting in October that the Fed published on Wednesday, did not produce any immediate change in policy. Officials decided at the meeting to press ahead with the current campaign, although the account said that a change could come "at one of its next few meetings."
The outlines of that shift have been clear for some time. The Fed intends to reduce and then suspend its monthly purchases of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities. At the same time, the Fed is seeking ways of emphasizing that it remains determined to keep borrowing costs for businesses and consumers as low as possible well into the future.
The leading candidate, according to the account, is a proposal to include in the Fed's policy statement, released after each meeting, a formal declaration that the Fed is likely to keep short-term rates relatively low even after it eventually decides to end the long period, dating back to 2008, that it has held those rates near zero.
The Federal Open Market Committee also discussed the possibility of describing some of the factors that it would consider in deciding how quickly to raise rates. So far, the committee has said only that it will keep interest rates near zero at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6.5 percent.
The Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, employed both approaches in a speech Tuesday night, stating that the 6.5 percent threshold would be the point at which Fed officials would begin to discuss the timing of an initial rate increase. That suggests that when the official unemployment rate, currently at 7.3 percent, reaches that point, it will probably not initiate an immediate increase in the lending tool, known as the federal funds rate, that the Fed directly controls.
"After the unemployment threshold is crossed, many other indicators become relevant to a comprehensive judgment of the health of the labor market, including such measures as payroll employment, labor force participation and the rates of hiring and separation," he said. "So long as inflation remains well behaved, the committee can be patient in seeking assurance that the labor market is sufficiently strong before considering any increase in its target for the federal funds rate."
Fed officials have remained relatively optimistic about economic growth in recent months, notwithstanding the tumultuous debate over fiscal policy that partly shuttered the federal government in October. The account noted that growth in the second half of 2013 may be slower than officials expected, but it said the disruptions had not altered their expectation of faster growth in 2014 and 2015.
The Fed has expanded its bond holdings by $85 billion each month this year, buying more than $4 trillion since it began such efforts during the financial crisis. Mr. Bernanke said in June that the Fed expected to begin to pull back before the end of the year, a prediction he has lately avoided repeating, but officials have made clear that they have not ruled out a change at their final meeting of the year, in mid-December.
"It is definitely on the table, but it is going to depend on the data," James Bullard, president of Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, said on Wednesday on Bloomberg Television. Mr. Bullard, who has been a strong supporter of the asset purchases, said the decision could rest on the reported level of job growth in November, which will be reported by the Labor Department on Dec. 6. "A strong jobs report, I think, would increase the probability some for a December taper," he said.
The Fed's determination to pull back from bond buying -- even if a final decision remains several months away -- was underscored by the account of the October meeting, which described officials as willing to begin the so-called tapering process even if they conclude that they will need to compensate by increasing other kinds of stimulus.
The account said that most officials were open to the idea of encouraging bank lending by reducing the interest rate on funds that banks keep on deposit with the central bank. Those reserves have ballooned with the Fed's bond purchases, because the Fed buys bonds from the banks and then credits their reserve accounts.
The Fed currently pays annual interest of 0.25 percent on bank reserves, which sounds like a pittance but cost $199 million in 2012. Officials have described the payments as a way of keeping inflation under control, because the reserves stay at the Fed. But with inflation sagging, economists including Princeton University's Alan Blinder have argued that the Fed should revisit its priorities.
The account the Fed released on Wednesday said the idea "could be worth considering at some stage," though it noted the benefits were likely to be small.
Janet L. Yellen, President Obama's nominee to lead the Fed for the next four years, said at her confirmation hearing last week that the idea "certainly is a possibility." She added, however, that officials remain concerned that a rate cut would disrupt financial markets. Keeping the interest rate on reserves above zero, for example, has created an incentive for banks to borrow from money market funds and then deposit the money with the Fed. In the absence of those payments, the money funds might actually be forced to pay the banks to take that same money.
"We've worried that if we were to lower that rate to close to zero, we would begin to impair money-market function," Ms. Yellen said at the hearing.
Officials also disagree about the potential benefits. Narayana Kocherlakota, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, has publicly backed the idea in recent speeches. Researchers at the New York Fed argued in a 2011 paper, however, that the availability of reserves had no influence on bank lending.
Other much-discussed possibilities drew little support inside the Fed's board room, including lowering the 6.5 percent threshold or stipulating that interest rates would remain near zero until inflation rose above a defined pace.
Officials are reluctant to replace the 6.5 percent threshold because they are concerned that doing so would undermine their credibility with investors. The idea of an inflation floor drew support from a larger group of officials, according to the Fed's account, but the benefits were viewed as "uncertain and likely to be modest."

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDEDTEHRAN -- Sitting atop a bronze statue in the center of Tehran's modest Manoucheri Square, where a group of illegal money changers gathers every day, a bald man waved a thick stack of dollar bills, as dozens of others shouted figures and numbers.
"Welcome to Tehran's open-air casino," said Behzad, a cheerful 34-year-old in the crowd around the statue. "Here everybody can become very rich or lose everything. In fact, most people here lose everything."
For most of the past decade, particularly since Western financial sanctions began to bite hard two years ago, the dollar has been king around Tehran's currency bazaar. With government oil revenues plunging and inflation surging, the Iranian national currency, the rial, plunged -- to 40,000 to the dollar at its lowest point, from 10,000 to the dollar. For most people, the question was never whether to exchange rials for dollars but how soon.
But these days, the tenor of the bazaar has changed. With the prospect of an interim deal on Iran's nuclear program -- and the loosening of the sanctions, which might help revive Iran's moribund economy -- the fortunes of the long-suffering Iranian currency are looking up. Some people have even begun to think it may even make sense now to dump dollars.
Walking along Jomhuri-e-Eslami Street, 55-year-old Nayyeh, an Iranian woman who, like others interviewed for this article, refused to give her last name, was quietly pondering these issues.
"Will the nuclear case be solved?" she mused, almost talking to herself. "If there is a deal you would expect the rial to strengthen. But on the other hand this is Iran: logic things never happen here. I think I'll wait with changing."
One thing all the traders could agree on was that things were slow in the market these days, with none of the drastic swings that provide profit opportunities for the savviest traders. "If you need someone to work for you, I am your man," a trader said jokingly, quoting a price that worked out to $13 a day.
Many traders speak wistfully of the heady times during the presidency of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Back then, with the president denying the Holocaust and talking about wiping out Israel, the rial suffered heavy losses. As sanctions fell into place, it sank even further. "Those were fantastic days," recalled one trader, who said he would flip dollars within 10 minutes, making profits from armies of worried middle-class Iranians trying to protect their savings.
Not everybody was so pessimistic. The money-trading business had made Behzad rich, he said. Wearing an Italian designer coat and polished leather boots, he stuck out from most of the other money traders, most of whom had arrived on the cheap Chinese motorcycles parked all around the square.
"You think I'm bluffing? Look at this," he said, holding up his iPhone 5 to show a photo of himself dressed only in shorts, sitting on a glass table filled with towering stacks of dollars.
"For me the sanctions have really worked," Behzad said. "I only change from a million and more. What you are seeing here is just the tip of the iceberg."
All around the square, hundreds of money changers lined the sidewalks. Some worked for official exchange bureaus, others operated from cars and alleyways.
For decades the government has been the biggest player, going to the black market to sell oil dollars for rials, to pay salaries and other domestic costs. "There are days they close down the entire area with riot police," said one trader, who had been in the exchange business since 1986. In October 2012, when the rial was in its steepest plunge, the money changers were rounded up, some of them jailed and their money impounded. At the time the government said the traders had been manipulating the market.
But some of the traders said it was in fact the Ahmadinejad administration that had engaged in market manipulations, trying to drive the dollar higher. "When they bring the security forces out it means they want the dollar to go up so they can get more rials for their dollars," one trader said.
A man was selling old bank notes from the time of the deposed shah, Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, drawing few customers. "At the time an entire family could live for a week with just one of those notes," said a man named Rostam, pointing at a 1,000 rial note, which would be worth roughly 3 cents today, if it were legal tender. It is not, but they are sold as collectors' items for $10 apiece.
"Those talks in Geneva will not lead to anything," he said, pointing angrily at the abandoned British Embassy building across the street. It was deserted after the British left Iran in 2011, following a protest by vigilantes who climbed the walls and destroyed several offices.
"All our problems are because of them," Rostam said, a common and not unreasonable complaint here, given the long history of British meddling. "I am sure they are still there, hiding underground and plotting against us."
Behzad, the young money trader, said he did not believe in conspiracies; actually, he did not believe in anything other than the power of the almighty dollar. "Nothing will ever be solved, the leaders of the Islamic Republic will be talking to U.S. presidents decades from now, and money will always need to be changed," he said.
He explained how he and others used to buy their dollars in Iran from average citizens and carry them in suitcases to Dubai and Turkey, to buy gold. "Because of differences in the rates, each run makes me around $20,000," he said. "I love the sanctions. I hope they are never lifted."
Correction: November 25, 2013, Monday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The Tehran Journal article on Thursday, about the rising fortunes of the Iranian currency, the rial, as prospects for an Iranian nuclear deal improve, misstated the year that the British -- whom one passer-by at Tehran's currency bazaar blamed for Iran's problems -- left Iran after vigilantes destroyed offices in the British Embassy building. It was 2011, not 2010.

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDEDWASHINGTON -- A few months of scrambled economic data have not altered the Federal Reserve's basic view that the American economy is gaining strength, nor its intention to start pulling back soon from its stimulus campaign, the Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said Tuesday evening.
Mr. Bernanke, in a speech with valedictory overtones as he prepares to step down, described the Fed's efforts to revive the economy since 2008 as coherent, consistent and successful. And he emphasized once again that even as the Fed begins to retreat, it would maintain the bulk of the campaign for years to come.
The speech, delivered at the annual dinner of the National Economics Club, did not directly address the timetable for the Fed's retreat, but in combination with other recent remarks by Fed officials, it is clear that they have not ruled out a change in policy as soon as December.
The Federal Open Market Committee, which sets policy, "still expects that labor market conditions will continue to improve and that inflation will move toward the 2 percent objective over the medium term," Mr. Bernanke said. "If these views are supported by incoming information, the F.O.M.C. will likely begin to moderate the pace of purchases."
Mr. Bernanke and other Fed officials are trying to prepare investors for a shift in Fed policy that is proving difficult to manage. The Fed is holding short-term interest rates near zero to reduce borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, its primary means of stimulating the economy. It is also buying $85 billion a month of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities to further reduce borrowing costs, which officials view as a temporary supplement.
The Fed's policy makers would like to wind down the bond buying. They also would like interest rates to stay low. But when Mr. Bernanke hinted in June that the Fed was getting ready to taper off the purchases, investors responded as if the Fed had also announced its intent to raise interest rates more quickly.
Mr. Bernanke said Tuesday that the rise in interest rates was "neither welcome nor warranted." The Fed said last year that it would hold short-term rates near zero at least as long as the unemployment rate remained above 6.5 percent. More recently, officials have emphasized that rates could remain near zero for some time after unemployment falls below that threshold. Mr. Bernanke offered a new formulation on Tuesday, telling the audience of economists that 6.5 percent would be the beginning of the Fed's internal debate.
"Crossing one of the thresholds will not automatically give rise to an increase in the federal funds rate target," Mr. Bernanke said. "Instead, it will signal only that it is appropriate for the committee to begin considering whether an increase in the target is warranted." Some Fed officials support a lower threshold, an option that Mr. Bernanke did not address.
Mr. Bernanke said that investors needed to understand that tapering off the bond purchases would not signal that the Fed planned to raise interest rates more quickly. "Markets are beginning to appreciate that they are separate tools and that the mix of those tools will change somewhat over time," he said in remarks after his prepared speech. "It's the most fundamental point I wanted to make," he added
The Fed has made only modest progress in increasing job growth. The share of Americans with jobs has not climbed since the recession, and inflation has hovered in recent months near the lowest annualized pace since the Great Depression, another sign of an economy still far from good health.
Lawrence H. Summers, formerly President Obama's chief economic adviser, has worried at recent public appearances about the risk of long-term economic stagnation.
After the speech, when a member of the audience suggested that the Fed's efforts were largely unavailing, Mr. Bernanke responded, "I hate to shock you but I don't agree with that."
"The Fed is making an important contribution to middle class and lower income folks' welfare," Mr. Bernanke said.
Some Fed officials see the limited success of the Fed's efforts as evidence that the Fed should do more. Charles L. Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and a leading advocate for stronger action, said on Tuesday that the Fed "is probably going to purchase $1.5 trillion in assets from January 2013 until we wind this down."
Mr. Bernanke, who has said that he expects purchases to conclude by the middle of 2014, reiterated in his speech on Tuesday the sobering reasons that he has supported the stimulus campaign, including "elevated unemployment, below-target inflation, lingering economic fragility, and the harmful effects of long-term unemployment on our society and economic potential."
Critics, however, see the Fed's efforts to increase employment as ineffective, and its desire to increase inflation as misguided. Charles I. Plosser, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, last week questioned the idea that the central bank should work to avoid deflation, or falling prices.
"It's not obvious a period of mild deflation is such a bad thing," Mr. Plosser said in response to a question from the audience after a speech at the libertarian Cato Institute.
Navigating those differences will not be Mr. Bernanke's problem for much longer. He is scheduled to step down at the end of January. The Senate Banking Committee has scheduled a Thursday morning vote on the nomination of Janet L. Yellen, currently the Fed's vice chairwoman, to be his successor.
Correction: November 21, 2013, Thursday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Wednesday about the Federal Reserve's bond-buying campaign, using information from the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, misstated the view of the bank's president, Charles L. Evans, about the duration of the campaign. Mr. Evans said, "We are probably going to purchase $1.5 trillion in assets from January 2013 until we wind this down." He did not say that purchases might need to continue until January 2015.

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDEDIndia's most revered athlete, Sachin Tendulkar, swung his final cricket bat on Friday ahead of one of the most watched and talked-about retirements from athletics in India -- or, for that matter, anywhere.
Now, he is trading his cricket uniform for a red turban and a fake mustache and a career in ads by an online travel agency.
Musafir.com, the online travel agency based in the United Arab Emirates, last month announced its arrival to Indians by hiring Mr. Tendulkar, one of the most recognizable faces on the subcontinent, as its "brand ambassador." The company would not say how much it is paying Mr. Tendulkar, 40, to plug the website, though it says he is also an investor.
But the batsman known affectionately across India as the Little Master will be pitting his star power against that of Salman Khan, the Bollywood movie leading man and possibly India's biggest celebrity, in a battle for the dollars of the new Indian middle class eager to travel. Yatra Online, a seven-year-old travel operator backed by the American venture capitalists Norwest Venture Partners and Intel Capital, hired Mr. Khan last year as its pitchman.
Musafir is trying to tap into these travel aspirations, spending $16.1 million in India over four to five years, a large part of which is for marketing. Its promotions urge Indians to "stop dreaming and start traveling." In a statement, the celebrated athlete noted that travel was "aspirational among Indians."
In hiring Mr. Tendulkar, Musafir is using two familiar Indian corporate tactics. Companies, from luxury watchmakers to airlines, frequently draft celebrities to sell products and even fill boardrooms. Indian Internet companies, in particular, raise considerable sums and then use it for advertising.
The market of Indian travelers looks tantalizing even though the country's economy has been slowing. PhoCusWright, a global travel research firm, expects Internet travel spending in India to reach $8.8 billion a year by 2016. It expects the market to continue swelling, as millions more Indians earn enough to fly and become comfortable buying online.
Three companies -- MakeMyTrip, the entrenched leader; Yatra; and the Bangalore-based operator Cleartrip.com -- handle nearly 90 percent of all online bookings nationwide, excluding bus tickets. Expedia, the American travel website, entered India in 2008, but has yet to gain a significant foothold.
"There is some strong competition out there already," said Chetan Kapoor, an analyst with PhoCusWright. "Just because a company is splurging marketing dollars to position itself a certain way, that doesn't ensure success."
The fevered interest may seem peculiar because the hard part of running an online travel service is not getting Indians to travel, but getting them to book their travel on the Internet. Indians can be noticeably skittish about buying online, as fraud protection is still limited.
Eighteen months ago, Yatra sold roughly 60 percent of its tickets through its large call center, the costly operation that all the big online agencies operate.
Thomas Cook India, a large multinational travel services provider, recently added 34 brick-and-mortar stores across India, primarily in smaller cities. Madhavan Menon, the managing director, said his eventual goal was to move more services online. But he conceded that customers first needed "hand-holding and reassuring human contact."
Nevertheless, new online entrants, like Musafir, are willing to give it a try. Albert Dias, a digital advertising executive, started Musafir in 2007 with two former college classmates. One co-founder, Sachin Gadoya, ran a travel agency then. The third, Sheikh Mohammed Abdullah al-Thani, is a member of the Qatari royal family; in May, he became the first from the nation to climb Mount Everest.
The three saw travelers in the Middle East countries pivot from old-fashioned agencies to online bookings. After adding 4,600 business clients in the region, they began to look for other places doing the same.
"We thought it was a fantastic opportunity," said Mr. Dias, so Musafir opened offices in India in 2010.
Musafir's arrival also signaled the continued influence of the area's states in India's aviation sector, which was fully opened to foreign investment only in September 2012. Two executives from Musafir's partner companies knew Mr. Tendulkar, who has endorsed more than 50 brands in his 24-year career, including Pepsi, Adidas and an alliance of Indian poultry farmers.
Forbes says his endorsement income makes him India's sixth-wealthiest celebrity, earning $18 million on top of his $4 million cricket salary, as of June. (In that contest, Mr. Khan is ahead as No. 2, with $27 million.)
Sharat Dhall, the president of rival Yatra, said Mr. Khan's presence spurred a surge in first-time bookings in smaller Indian cities -- metropolises of one to five million people, where Internet use is expanding.
The actor frequently stars in commercials for the agency, in English and Hindi, often imitating his screen personas. In the Musafir advertisement, which is now online and will move to TV and radio this week, Mr. Tendulkar, dressed as a fictional sheikh, silently snaps photographs of young Indians in imagined destinations.
India's online travel industry is especially challenged now with high fuel prices and inflation forcing airlines to raise ticket prices. Only one of the five top carriers is not losing money. "It has been a tough year for domestic air," Mr. Dhall said. "Some of the growth has been sluggish, even negative."
Yatra is focusing on hotel bookings and escorted trips, while Musafir plans to concentrate on catered holiday tours overseas for Indians.
"We intend to establish our brand," Mr. Dias said, "built around the trust and longevity that Sachin Tendulkar stands for."

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Wednesday about travel agencies' efforts to lure customers in India included outdated information on an expansion in that country by the travel services provider Thomas Cook India. It has added 34 brick-and-mortar stores; the stores are not in the planning stage.

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDEDGUANAJUATO, Mexico -- A decade ago, Ivan Zamora, 23, might have already left for the United States. Instead, he graduated in May from a gleaming new university here, then moved on to an engineering internship at one of the many multinational companies just beyond the campus gates.
His days now begin at dawn inside the new Volkswagen factory a short walk away, and when he leaves at night, he joins a rush of the upwardly mobile -- from the cavernous new Pirelli plant next door, an array of Japanese car-parts suppliers and a new Nivea plant on a grassy hillside.
"There's just a lot more opportunity to study and to succeed," Mr. Zamora said at the factory, surrounded by robots, steel, glass and young technicians. "Both my parents are teachers. They lived in an entirely different era."
Education. More sophisticated work. Higher pay. This is the development formula Mexico has been seeking for decades. But after the free-market wave of the 1990s failed to produce much more than low-skilled factory work, Mexico is finally attracting the higher-end industries that experts say could lead to lasting prosperity. Here, in a mostly poor state long known as one of the country's main sources of illegal immigrants to the United States, a new Mexico has begun to emerge.
Dozens of foreign companies are investing, filling in new industrial parks along the highways. Middle-class housing is popping up in former watermelon fields, and new universities are waving in classes of students eager to study engineering, aeronautics and biotechnology, signaling a growing confidence in Mexico's economic future and what many see as the imported meritocracy of international business. In a country where connections and corruption are still common tools of enrichment, many people here are beginning to believe they can get ahead through study and hard work.
Mr. Zamora's new job, for example (he was hired by VW at summer's end), started with his parents prioritizing education, not emigration, and scrimping to give him a computer and, more recently, German lessons. The state of Guanajuato added to their investment by building the affordable polytechnic -- part of a public university system that offers technical degrees as well as undergraduate and graduate degrees -- and a sprawling interior port to lure the international companies that hire its graduates. And now Mr. Zamora has a job that pays enough to help his sister pursue her dream of studying marine biology.
This is a Mexico far different from the popular American conception: it is neither the grinding, low-skilled assembly work at maquiladoras, the multinational factories near the border, nor the ugliness of drug cartels. But the question many experts and officials are asking is whether Mexico as a whole can keep up with the rising demand for educated labor -- and overcome concerns about crime and corruption -- to propel its 112 million people into the club of developed nations.
"We are at something of a turning point," said Eric Verhoogen, a professor of economics and international affairs at Columbia University. "The maquila strategy has been revealed not to have been successful, so people are looking around for something new."
The automotive industry has been Mexico's brightest spot so far. In many ways, central Mexico has already surpassed Detroit. There are now more auto-industry jobs in Mexico than in the entire American Midwest. At least 100,000 jobs have been added in Mexico since 2010, according to a recent Brookings Institution report, and General Motors, Ford, Chrysler, Honda, Mazda, Nissan, Audi and Volkswagen have all announced expansion plans, with nearly $10 billion to be invested over the next several years, mainly in a 400-mile corridor from Puebla to Aguascalientes.
The work tends to be better paid than what could be found in the area before the companies arrived. It is still a fraction of the salaries of American workers -- many employees on the factory floors in the interior port make around $3.65 an hour -- but higher-paid professionals make up about 30 percent of the employees at many auto plants here, roughly twice as much as in the maquiladoras near the border.
And although robotics and other changes have kept overall employment in the industry somewhat limited, more of the industry has moved to Mexico as the car business has recovered. Around 40 percent of all auto-industry jobs in North America are in Mexico, up from 27 percent in 2000 (the Midwest has about 30 percent), and experts say the growth is accelerating, especially in Guanajuato, where state officials have been increasing incentives.
The 2,600-acre interior port, for example, has become a draw because, in addition to the polytechnic, the state built customs facilities, a railroad depot and a link to the local airport. Guanajuato also helps find candidates for companies to hire and, in some cases, gives them free classes to help them pass standardized tests required for employment. At Volkswagen, many of the young men and women flowing in and out of test-taking sessions said they benefited from the assistance.
Guanajuato even pays companies a small bonus for sending workers abroad for training. Mauricio Martínez, 29, an engineer at the Italian tiremaker Pirelli, which was one of the first companies to take up residence in the port, said he and his wife, Mariana, still saw their trip to Prague after his training in Romania as a fairy tale.
"I'm a small-town guy," he said one day after work, in his kitchen with a beer. "But there I was; an Italian company from Milan hired a small-town guy from Mexico."
He said he now makes $2,250 a month ($27,000 a year), far more than at his old job at a tow-truck company and roughly double the median household income nationwide. That's more than enough for a middle-class life here. Both husband and wife drive to work, and this year they bought a three-bedroom townhouse in a new development for about $80,000. On a recent visit, "The Big Bang Theory" played on their flat-screen TV as a neighbor watered her patch of lawn no bigger than a beach towel.
While cooking dinner, Mrs. Martínez said that her husband's job had given them the credit and stability they needed to start her own business -- a gourmet salad shop in a colonial village nearby. And as is common in other countries with an expanding middle class, such as Brazil, their economic rise has led to demands for better government.
When someone recently stole Mrs. Martínez's cellphone, she said she went straight to the police over the objections of her father, who warned her nothing would be done. "He was right," she said. "But next time it happens, I want my complaint to be there. I'm trying to make a living here, and I want a legal life."
"My generation, we're more prepared," she added. "My parents, they never even finished school; we know if something is going to change, it has to start with us."
Many young, middle-class Mexicans are coming to similar realizations, propelled by 13 years of democracy and the Internet. But their ranks are small. As the auto industry rebounds and wage inflation in China makes Mexico more attractive for global manufacturers, many foreign employers say that skilled employees are harder to find and keep, while the mass of Mexican workers do not measure up to what many companies need.
Only 36 percent of Mexicans between 25 and 64 have earned the equivalent of a high school degree, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Despite a rapid rise in foreign investment, with 2013 shaping up to be Mexico's best year on record, the country is still struggling.
The Mexican economy has slowed significantly this year, and even when it was doing better, the nation's poverty rate fell only 0.6 percent to 53.3 million people -- roughly 45 percent of the population -- between 2010 and 2012. Crime and a notoriously weak justice system continue to undermine the economy, with Mexico's minister of health recently estimating that it costs 1.34 percent of the country's annual gross domestic product. "It's all the stuff we hear about again and again: Mexico has an education system that is not on par with its peers; a banking system that's not lending; it has rule-of-law issues and public-security issues and corruption being a huge issue," said Christopher Wilson, an economics scholar at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington. "The list goes on and on."
Many economists and business consultants are keeping a close watch on President Enrique Peña Nieto's efforts to improve education, open the energy sector to private investment and overhaul taxes.
Kevin P. Gallagher, an economist at Boston University, said Mexico also needed to prioritize innovation. "South Korea and Taiwan spend over 2 percent of G.D.P. on research and development; China spends almost 2 percent," he said. "Mexico spends 0.4 percent."
But on a smaller scale in Guanajuato, individual success is creating a sense of possibility. Some of Mr. Zamora's friends are studying German, too, hoping to land work at Volkswagen, and a similar sense of momentum pervades the polytechnic, where students in pristine industrial labs, like Javier Eduardo Luna Zapata, 24, have begun to dream of more than work at an auto plant.
He and a few classmates won a prestigious design award this year for a scanner that would check airport runways for debris. "We want to start a company," he said, displaying a video of the project on his cellphone. "We're going to look for investors when we graduate."
His classmates, representing a new generation of Mexicans -- mostly geeks in jeans carrying smartphones -- all nodded with approval.

Correction: November 23, 2013, Saturday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Tuesday about the rising middle class in central Mexico misstated the portion of the country's gross domestic product that is consumed by the costs of crime and a weak justice system, according to an estimate from the minister of health. It is 1.34 percent -- not the 8 to 15 percent that the minister first reported. (She later corrected herself.)

Full text:   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan -- Pakistan's government said Sunday that it was initiating a treason prosecution of the country's former ruler, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, in what would be a groundbreaking, if politically charged, assertion of civilian supremacy over the powerful Pakistani military.
Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan said that the government had asked the Supreme Court to establish a special panel to try General Musharraf on accusations that he subverted the Constitution in late 2007 when he imposed emergency rule and fired much of the judiciary.
The military has ruled Pakistan for about half of the country's 66-year history, and no ruler or top military commander had ever faced criminal prosecution until General Musharraf's return from exile in April. Since then, he has faced criminal prosecution in four cases related to his time in power.
But a treason prosecution would sharply raise the stakes between civilian and military leaders -- the charge carries a potential death penalty -- and, analysts warned on Sunday, could cast the country into new political turmoil.
"It is a can of worms," said Talat Masood, a retired general and respected political commentator. "It is really absurd."
The decision to proceed against General Musharraf comes at a tough time for Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, whose government is facing increasing scrutiny for its handling of the economy, foreign relations and security. And personally, Mr. Sharif, who is visiting Thailand, has been criticized for his frequent foreign tours even as Pakistan has faced struggle after struggle.
On Friday, at least nine people were killed and 50 were wounded in Rawalpindi, the garrison city next to the capital, as sectarian riots broke out between Shiite and Sunni groups.
The violence led the government to clamp a two-day curfew on the city, suspend cellphone services and bring out troops in several other cities to quell tensions.
And relations with the United States are under strain over accusations that an American drone strike that killed the Taliban leader Hakimullah Mehsud sabotaged nascent peace talks with the Pakistani Taliban.
With such a turbulent political environment as backdrop, the sudden announcement of treason charges brought immediate questions and criticism.
"What we saw today was a political decision," said Fahd Hussain, the director of news at the Express News television network. "It was important for Nawaz Sharif to be seen to deliver on his past pledges."
What seems clear, at least, is that Mr. Sharif's government wanted to prevent General Musharraf from slipping out of Pakistan into exile. General Musharraf, a former army chief, had been under house arrest at his villa outside Islamabad until earlier this month, when he was released on bail on all cases and later requested permission to go to Dubai, United Arab Emirates, to visit his mother.
On Monday, lawyers for General Musharraf are due to make a court application to have him taken off an official list that prevents him from leaving Pakistan. A treason prosecution would result in new restrictions on Mr. Musharraf's movements, although it remained unclear how quickly the Supreme Court would move on Monday.
In a statement on Sunday, General Musharraf's office described the treason charges as a "vicious attempt to undermine the Pakistan military" and a "botched attempt" to divert attention from the country's other problems.
Babar Sattar, a lawyer and columnist with the English-language daily newspaper Dawn, said that Mr. Sharif appeared to be betting that the army would not stop the judiciary from trying General Musharraf in open court.
"I think Nawaz realizes that Musharraf is a bygone for the army," he said. "He wants to fix him but does not want to give an impression that it is revenge."
General Musharraf's supporters say the law is being applied selectively, pointing out that many senior justices, including the country's crusading chief justice, Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, validated the 1999 coup that brought the military ruler to power. Mr. Chaudhry was among the judges fired by Mr. Musharraf during the state of emergency, and later became a rallying point for opposition to the former general's rule.
The decision to put General Musharraf on trial also comes at a time of transition for the military. The current army chief, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, is due to retire at the end of this month. Chief Justice Chaudhry is due to retire in December.
But if Mr. Sharif is seeking to take advantage of this period of transition in Pakistan's power politics, many warned that it could backfire.
"They are adopting an unchartered course of action that contains many hazards," said Hasan Askari Rizvi, a defense analyst. "This case may ultimately alienate the military."
Mr. Rizvi added that governance had been "very poor" and that ordinary people had been severely affected in the last five to six months by inflation and chronic power shortages.
"It just shows very poor sense of priority. What are they trying to achieve?" said Mr. Masood, the retired general. "The army is involved in the tribal belt. It is also involved in maintaining peace in Karachi and now in Rawalpindi. What message is the government sending?"

Full text:   BEIRUT, Lebanon -- Syrian government forces have recently ousted rebels from a string of suburbs outside Damascus, threatening their yearlong control of territory south of the capital city, cutting supply lines and surrounding strongholds that one fighter called their "last castle" in the area.
Around the northern city of Aleppo, rebels are also newly on the defensive. They are demanding that all fighters mobilize against a government offensive or face consequences in Islamic courts.
These recent battlefield successes -- allowing the government to threaten rebel strongholds in and around Syria's two main cities -- prompted Syria's prime minister, Wael al-Halqi, to declare on Thursday that the government was heading for an "astounding victory," just as President Bashar al-Assad prepares for peace talks that the United States and Russia hope to convene by year's end.
Yet early declarations of victory may be premature, as has been the case many times with both sides in this two-and-a-half-year-old civil war.
Still, Mr. Assad has made gains, and the momentum has tipped, at least for now, in his direction even while the nation remains badly fractured. He has kept rebels from advancing into a partially encircled Damascus and has now retaken crucial suburbs that rebels relied on to keep pressure on the capital. He forestalled a United States attack with a chemical weapons deal that solidified his global position. And the rise of extremist Islamists among the rebels has kept the West at bay and demoralized supporters of the rebellion.
The coming weeks will show whether the government can make lasting gains and move battle lines that have shifted only marginally in the past year. Until recently, escalating tactics have yielded little but mounting civilian suffering, with neither side advancing even as the government was accused of using siege and starvation as well as chemical and incendiary weapons, and rebels shelled civilian areas to chip away at the comfort zone inside central Damascus.
In recent days, rebels say, the government has come close to encircling rebels in the southern suburb of Hajar al-Aswad and neighboring Yarmouk Camp, a district once home to both Syrians and Palestinian refugees that has been a battle zone for more than a year and is now fiercely contested by pro- and antigovernment Palestinian fighters.
But just one neighborhood away, in Tadamon, on the southern edge of Damascus, pro-government militias remain dug in, facing rebels along long-static front lines. On a recent visit, officers there -- surveying deserted, rubble-strewn streets as rebel automatic rifle fire smacked into nearby buildings -- said it took them weeks last November to push invading rebels back just a few hundred yards in fighting that shattered blocks of apartment houses.
They said they viewed the opposing fighters as their equals in skill and equipment, and that they had no plans to try to advance, to avoid military and civilian casualties that would further stress hospitals and fighters already stretching their capacity.
"We don't need more mortars or injuries," said an officer who asked to be identified as Abu Salim. He said his mission was simply not to let the enemy advance, "whatever it costs."
Pro-government militias like his have been left to guard such areas while better trained and equipped army units fight more crucial battles, sometimes alongside the Lebanese Shiite group Hezbollah and Iraqi Shiite militias, whose fighters have long been gathered around Sayeda Zeinab, home to a revered Shiite shrine southeast of Damascus.
Part of the failure of Syrian forces to capitalize fully on their gains, according to government fighters and supporters, stems from conflicting strategies within the government. Some officials are trying to moderate the fighting and seek local cease-fires, especially after the threat of an American strike and the government's effort to portray itself as seeking peace on the international stage. Others are advocating a more aggressive strategy.
And while the government has sought to project itself as in control of Syria, the crisis has only deepened: The number of refugees has increased more than fourfold. The death toll has doubled, Shiite militiamen have flooded the country to aid the government, Kurds have declared an autonomous zone in the northeast, and Sunni jihadist groups have wrested some areas from rival rebels in attempts to establish religious rule.
Even if government advances stick, no quick military resolution is in sight, experts said. When the government aided by Hezbollah took the city of Qusayr, near the Lebanese border, in May, supporters said it would soon go on to sweep rebels from pockets in and around Homs and Aleppo to the north. But despite some advances around those cities, the government has yet to repeat a wholesale takeover of a rebel population center, nor has it been able even to normalize the small city of Qusayr, which remains a military zone bereft of residents and patrolled by the government and its Hezbollah allies.
In September, after the chemical deal, government officials declared that broad segments of rebel-held Damascus suburbs from the southwest to the northeast would be retaken within weeks. Two months later, the current advance is just beginning to gather force.
For weeks, government opponents and supporters have said they expect the next major battle to be over Qalamoun, north of Damascus, an area that has replaced Qusayr as the rebels' main conduit from Lebanon. On Friday, people from the town of Qara began fleeing across the border, saying the government was fiercely shelling the area, according to a rebel fighter in the Lebanese border town of Aarsal. But residents and analysts say the battle for Qalamoun's mountain towns and villages could be a harder slog than taking over lowland Qusayr, especially in winter.
Farther north, the government solidly holds the coastal cities of Tartous and Latakia but has been unable to push rebels from the mountains north of Latakia near the Turkish border -- nor have insurgents there been able to hold southward advances, instead squabbling and sometimes killing one another in disputes over authority and weapons.
Along the border with Turkey, neither rebels nor the government can control the flow of the jihadists who are increasingly seen as enemies of both. Abu Mohammed, a smuggler, said in an interview in the border town of Azaz that he had brought in many foreign fighters from across the Muslim world and Europe for $3,000 a head, easily bringing them as far south as Homs by bribing government troops at checkpoints for as little as a carton of cigarettes.
Near Aleppo, the government took Base 80, important for its location near the airport, on Nov. 9, along with nearby towns that it could use to threaten rebel control of half of the city, and killed and wounded top rebel leaders in an airstrike. Rebels say they are still fighting for the base. And while around Damascus it is the government that blockades rebel areas, in Aleppo rebels control the flow of food in and out of a government enclave, whose residents wait hours to cross checkpoints to the rebel side to buy cheaper food.
A shopkeeper in Damascus, who identified himself as Abu Subhi, 55, said he tuned out the news and watched religious videos on a small television in his shop in the Rukineddine district.
"If Bashar stays or goes, I don't care," he said of the president. "But I'm sure if he stays in power, there will be no stability and security in Syria for years."
Both sides, he said, talk of "big victories" but fail to deliver. "I don't see any change," he said. "Every day there are mortars, checkpoints, no fuel, long blackouts, no cooking gas and inflation."

Full text:   It is sometimes the small events that reveal the really big problems lurking beneath the surface. That's the case with the Federal Aviation Administration's recent decision to grant airlines the liberty of allowing the use of electronic devices during takeoff and landing.
You still won't be able to call on your cellphone during those times, but, if the airline allows it, you will be able to read on your Kindle or play Angry Birds throughout the flight.
That's the good news. What's the deeper problem? Our new Kindle freedoms, however minor they may seem, show how hard it is to clear away the old, unnecessary regulations that are impeding the economy.
After all, the previous restriction on electronics during flights was broadly unpopular in a way that cut across partisan lines. Yet, for many years, the public's complaints did not bring concrete change, mostly because of regulatory inertia. (If you're worried about safety, by the way, the airlines can still, at their discretion, demand that these devices be turned off when deemed necessary.)
Conservatives typically complain about too much regulation, but liberals should be concerned, too, because pruning away rules we don't need should help usher in an economy with more job creation and stronger economic growth.
The total number of federal regulatory restrictions is now more than one million. And they're not all necessarily good ideas. For instance, the Food and Drug Administration has banned some useful asthma treatments because they have a slight negative impact on the ozone layer. The nation has medical-device regulations that take longer to satisfy than those of the European Union.
Many regulations, when initially presented, can sound desirable. The problem is that, taken in their entirety, excess rules divert attention from pressing issues like the need for innovation and new jobs.
Michael Mandel, an economist at the Progressive Policy Institute, compares many regulations to "pebbles in a stream." Individually, they may not have a big impact. But if there are too many pebbles, a river's flow can be thwarted. Similarly, too many regulations can limit business activity. When the number of rules mounts, it can become hard for a business to know whether it is operating within the law's confines. The issue is all the more problematic when federal, state and local constraints all apply.
Our public sector is overregulated, too. For instance, the tangle known as government procurement has exacerbated problems with the Affordable Care Act's health insurance exchanges. The required formal processes made it difficult to hire the best possible talent, led to nightmare organizational charts and resulted in blurred lines of accountability. It's hard to turn on a dime and fix such problems overnight, no matter how pressing the need.
We don't really know the total regulatory burden in our economy today, in part because there are too many rules and side effects to add up all the costs. Nonetheless, we are continually increasing the obstacles to doing business. America has lost the robust productivity growth of much of the postwar era, and the share of start-ups in the economy has been falling each decade since the 1980s. Although overregulation is hardly the only culprit, it is very likely contributing to the problem.
The point isn't that we should eliminate all regulation or give up on clean air and water. In fact, we may need tougher guidelines -- albeit simpler ones -- to govern what is permissible for activities like financial risk-taking or burning coal. Still, a paring back of regulation in many areas, based on clearer priorities, seems in order.
The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, within the White House, has advocated a retrospective review of unnecessary regulations. That's a good idea, but the office has a full-time staff of only about 50, and its budget, adjusted for inflation, has declined since the early 1980s. The regulatory agencies outspend the office by a factor of about 7,000. The core problem is that the system is not geared for an efficiency-oriented regulatory review.
Some past deregulatory successes came in "big bang" changes, like the airline deregulation of the 1970s, which shut down the Civil Aeronautics Board. What we need today is the selective pruning of bad regulations. Cost-benefit studies are a good idea, but they tend to be done when we have the worst possible information about the effects of regulations -- namely, before the regulations are passed. Furthermore, cost-benefit studies may look only at some of the largest regulations, and not the general problem of regulatory accretion over time.
Better bureaucratic incentives are needed. Agencies are now motivated to generate regulation after regulation, because those are the formal assignments set before them. One possible step forward would be to require agencies to submit plans for retiring some fraction of their regulations over the next few years, and to reward these agencies for seeing this process through.
In short, your newly found Kindle freedom isn't a big deal in itself. In fact, the time it took to win that small yet popular change should remind us that, behind the scenes, much more needs to be done.

Full text:   AMERICAN inflation, which has seemed to some conservative economists to be an impending threat ever since the Federal Reserve began to buy large quantities of government securities, appears to be falling to levels lower than any seen in recent years. There are similar declines in many European countries.
The decline in the inflation measure most watched by the Federal Reserve -- the personal consumption expenditures deflator -- could provide a reason for the Fed to delay the widely expected tapering of bond purchases. Last week, the government reported that the price index had risen only 0.9 percent over the 12 months through September. "Fed officials have said that their ultra-easy monetary policy is justified not only by weakness in the labor markets but also by declining consumer price inflation, especially if it gets too close to deflation," Ed Yardeni, the chief investment strategist of Yardeni Research, wrote this week. "They've indicated that even if the unemployment rate falls down to 6.5 percent, they might be in no rush to tighten policy if inflation remains too low."
The unemployment rate in October was 7.3 percent, and the Fed had not been expecting the personal consumption expenditures inflation rate to fall as low as it has.
Inflation has also been falling in Europe, where the European Central Bank cut interest rates last week in response to a surprising estimate that consumer prices in the euro zone rose just 0.7 percent in the year through July.
This week, Britain reported that its annual inflation rate fell to a four-year low of 2.2 percent. France reported that its annual inflation rate was just 0.6 percent, also a four-year low. The latest rates in Germany (1.2 percent), Spain (1.3 percent) and Italy (0.8 percent) are three-year lows.
The exception to the trend is in Japan, which has been plagued by deflation for years. The latest report showed no change in consumer prices over the previous 12 months, a welcome sign to the Japanese government, which has been aggressively trying to turn around the economy.
Lower oil prices have played a role in keeping inflation down this year. But as can be seen in the accompanying charts, the core inflation rate, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, is also low, at 1.2 percent over the most recent 12 months.
One sector that is helping to hold down inflation is durable goods, where prices continue to fall.
Perhaps the most surprising part of the latest American inflation report was that the cost of health care services in the third quarter was just 1.1 percent above the level of a year earlier. That was the smallest annual increase since 1962. If health care costs were to rise less than expected over the next few years, that would do a lot to relieve the budget pressure brought on by expected increases in Medicare costs.
Central banks now generally target an inflation rate of 2 percent, and view figures below that potentially as alarming as figures above it. At a news conference in September, Ben Bernanke, the soon-to-retire chairman of the Fed, said, "The committee would be unlikely to increase rates if inflation were projected to remain below our 2 percent objective for some time."

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The questions that Janet L. Yellen faced on Thursday from senators considering her nomination to lead the Federal Reserve made two things fairly clear: The job is hers, and it's not going to be easy.
Democrats and Republicans on the Senate Banking Committee treated Ms. Yellen as if she were already the Fed's chairwoman, skipping over questions about her qualifications and instead venting broad frustrations about the slow pace of economic growth.
Ms. Yellen, the Fed's vice chairwoman since 2010, faced particularly sharp questions about the limited success of the Fed's efforts to stimulate the economy. Members of both parties questioned whether the Fed's policies had mostly benefited the wealthy, while doing little to improve life for most Americans.
The Fed's campaign to hold down interest rates was described as "an elitist policy" by Senator Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican, and as "a sort of trickle-down economics" by Senator Sherrod Brown, an Ohio Democrat.
"It's not clear to the many Americans who have not seen a raise in a number of years, that this policy increases wages and incomes for workers on Main Street," Mr. Brown said. "During your time as chair, tell us how you will ensure that the Fed's monetary policy directly benefits families on Main Street."
Ms. Yellen, 67, avoided any surprises in her calm and careful responses, which hewed closely to the Fed's official positions and her own past remarks. She made clear that she was committed to continuing the Fed's stimulus campaign, which she said had "made a meaningful contribution to economic growth."
She acknowledged that investors benefited from low interest rates, in part because they helped lift the stock market, but she said that people buying homes and cars also were direct beneficiaries. And she emphasized the indirect benefits of the Fed's campaign: "The ripple effects go through the economy and bring benefits to, I would say, all Americans."
The performance appeared to serve its purpose. The office of Senator Tim Johnson, the South Dakota Democrat who is chairman of the committee, said a vote could come as early as next week to send her nomination to the full Senate.
"We need her expertise at the helm of the Fed as the nation continues to recover from the Great Recession," Mr. Johnson said at the hearing.
Ms. Yellen will need at least five Republican votes to reach the 60-vote threshold that the minority party routinely imposes on presidential nominees.
The votes may not be hard to find. Mr. Corker appeared to be trying to help Ms. Yellen when he asked her to state for the record how many times she had voted as a Fed official to raise interest rates, thus demonstrating a commitment to control inflation. When she said that she could not remember precisely, Mr. Corker supplied an answer: 27 times, dating back to 1994, when she first joined the Fed's Board of Governors.
But David Vitter, Republican of Louisiana, said after the hearing that he planned to vote against her, citing in particular Ms. Yellen's views on financial regulation.
"I was leaning no and I am going to vote no," Mr. Vitter told Fox Business Network. "Unfortunately none of her answers were reassuring to me, including about my biggest concern about the continuation of too big to fail."
Mr. Vitter had plenty of company in raising concerns about the Fed's commitment to regulating big banks, an indication of the importance attached in the wake of the financial crisis to a set of responsibilities that the Fed and Congress long treated as an afterthought.
Some of the strongest questions came from Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, who criticized the Fed for its regulatory failings before the crisis and expressed concern that it still was not trying hard enough.
"The truth is if the regulators had done their jobs and reined in the banks we wouldn't need to be talking about" stimulus, Ms. Warren said.
Ms. Yellen held her ground. She did not concede that the Fed's failures played a role in the crisis -- something Fed officials have acknowledged in other contexts -- even as she insisted that the Fed was working hard to prevent a repeat.
"I absolutely believe our supervisory responsibilities are critical and they're just as important as monetary policy and we need to take them just as seriously," she said.
Ms. Warren and other senators also pressed Ms. Yellen to explain why the Fed was taking so long to impose new restrictions on large banks, and whether she considered the restrictions authorized by current law sufficient.
Ms. Yellen said she would withhold judgment until the regulatory work was complete.
Senators spent little time examining the Fed's near-term plans, and Ms. Yellen offered little new information in her debut as the Fed's leading explainer.
She generally cast herself as committed to continuing the policies of the current Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke. She said economic growth was strong enough for the Fed to pull back from its stimulus campaign by reducing its monthly bond purchases, but that officials needed to be convinced growth would not falter when they did so.
Any differences were a matter of emphasis: a little more willingness to constrain large banks, or to press ahead with asset purchases.
The Fed is expanding its holdings of Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities by $85 billion a month to drive down borrowing costs for businesses and consumers. Some Fed officials are concerned that the asset purchases are undermining financial stability by leading to excesses in certain markets. Ms. Yellen said the Fed was paying close attention to that possibility, but "at this stage I do not see risks to financial stability."
In response to questioning by Senator Mike Crapo, Republican of Idaho, Ms. Yellen acknowledged that "this program cannot continue forever," but she also made clear that she saw no reason to pull back other than stronger growth.
"I consider it imperative," she said, "that we do what we can to promote a very strong recovery."

Full text:   When we're choosing a leader for the nation's central banking system, one of the important things to consider is whether Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina has heard enough testimony about the 2012 attack in Benghazi, Libya.
Allow me to explain.
President Obama's nominee to be the next head of the Federal Reserve Board is Janet Yellen. The Senate banking committee is grilling her on Thursday, and there should be a lot of questions about unemployment and inflation.
However, that could all wind up being beside the point. Senator Graham says he is going to place a "hold" on Yellen and all other pending nominations because he doesn't believe Congress has had a chance to interview enough people who were present in the Benghazi compound when four Americans were tragically killed.
"Where are the Benghazi survivors? I'm going to block every appointment in the U.S. Senate until they are made available to Congress," he twittered recently.
So much for Janet Yellen. Also the president's nominee to be head of homeland security. God help the guy who's up for the Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board and has been cooling his heels since last December.
After a while, this sort of thing can weigh down a presidency. For instance, as you've listened with mounting frustration to the rollout of HealthCare.gov, did you ever wonder why President Obama is keeping Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services, on the job? Try to imagine what would happen if she left. How much chance do you think the president would have of ever getting a replacement? I am thinking slightly worse than the odds on the White House being attacked by giant killer zucchini.
We all know how easy it is to tie up the Senate. But it's particularly fascinating, in a train-wreck sort of way, when you see somebody do it because he's ticked off over a totally unrelated matter. (This is an excellent opportunity to recall the time that then-Senator Jim Bunning of Kentucky held up the confirmation of a nominee to be deputy trade representative because he was irked about Canada's ban on candy-flavored cigarettes.)
The "hold" is not to be confused with the filibuster; well, actually, go right ahead and confuse them. The end result is pretty much the same. The Senate stops dead in its tracks for an endless spree of wrangling about the rules. The majority leader has to find 60 votes to get it moving again.
We can probably presume that Harry Reid will pull out all the stops for Yellen, and he will probably, eventually, be successful. Even though Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, in concert with Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, is also planning to put a hold on the nomination until the Senate agrees to take up a bill calling for audits of the Federal Reserve.
And then it's time for holiday vacations.
But about Lindsey Graham. While Congressional committees have questioned tons of people about Benghazi, he says he needs to hear from five survivors of the attack. The State Department doesn't want to provide them because they might wind up being witnesses in criminal trials if the perpetrators are ever caught.
The five were already questioned by an independent review commissioned by then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. That panel found that officials like U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice were wrong when they theorized the attack might have grown out of a protest against a crude movie making fun of Muhammad. The review also found that security at the compound was inadequate. The assistant secretary of state for diplomatic security resigned.
But Graham is not at all satisfied. As he told Candy Crowley on CNN, he needs to find out if the survivors think the protest theory was wrong. Also, if he ever gets the chance, he will ask them, "Was there inadequate security, in your mind?"
The senator was further enraged by the State Department's stonewalling after "60 Minutes" interviewed "Morgan Jones," who was in Benghazi on the night of the attack, and told a dramatic story about how he warned people of the danger but nobody listened. His righteous wrath was not shaken in the least when Morgan's story turned out to be entirely made up. Perhaps Graham was recalling the immortal words of Mia Farrow in an old Woody Allen movie: "He's fictional, but you can't have everything."
The one thing that doesn't seem to be on Graham's list of questions that needs answering is whether we should have used military force to topple Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi in the first place. Even if it seemed like a good idea at the time, maybe we ought to reflect. After all, Libya's not looking like the happy ending we might have hoped for. The president never did get consent from Congress, and there were critics at the time. Who Lindsey Graham said "should sort of shut up."
Whoops.

Abstract: The government of Bangladesh is expected to soon announce an increase in the minimum wage for workers in the country's clothing factories, which are big suppliers to Western retailers like Walmart and H&M. Its decision could improve the lives of millions of families that struggle to eke out an existence on as little as the equivalent of about $38 a month, the current minimum wage.

Full text:   The government of Bangladesh is expected to soon announce an increase in the minimum wage for workers in the country's clothing factories, which are big suppliers to Western retailers like Walmart and H&M. Its decision could improve the lives of millions of families that struggle to eke out an existence on as little as the equivalent of about $38 a month, the current minimum wage.
A government-appointed board last week recommended to the Labor Ministry that the minimum wage be increased to about $68 a month. Factory owners, who wield tremendous political power in Bangladesh, have argued that they cannot afford the proposed increase and are pushing for a smaller one. But workers have said that they would not settle for less than $100 a month and have been protesting in the streets to press their case.
Here are some facts: The minimum wage was last increased in 2010. Since then, consumer prices have risen by 28 percent, according to government data. A basic diet that meets the needs of a family of three alone costs about $67 a month, according to a recent analysis by the Center for Policy Dialogue, a respected research organization based in Dhaka, the nation's capital. At the same time, the garment industry, second to China's in exports, has grown at a stunning rate in recent years and can afford to pay workers more. Bangladesh exported $19 billion in clothes last year, up more than 50 percent from two years earlier.
Government officials and industry executives say a big increase in the minimum wage might force some factories to close if they are not able to pass the costs to customers in the United States and Europe. That concern may be overblown. Several Western companies have made commitments to increase factory inspections and pay for safety improvements after a building collapse killed more than 1,100 garment workers near Dhaka earlier this year. Some businesses like H&M already support a higher minimum wage. Raising the minimum -- and indexing it to inflation -- would help workers and boost productivity by reducing the threat of strikes and protests.

Abstract: In 1997, President Bill Clinton signed into law the Children's Health Insurance Program, which now covers eight million children whose families' incomes are too high to qualify for Medicaid. The biggest reasons: the aging of the population, which has swollen the rolls of Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid (which also covers nursing home care), and the steady growth in the cost of health care.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Underlying fierce Republican efforts to stop President Obama's health care law and the White House drive to save it is a simple historical reality: Once major entitlement programs get underway, they quickly become embedded in American life. And then they grow.
That makes the battle over the Affordable Care Act more consequential than most Washington political fights. "If it's in place for six months, it will be impossible to repeal it or change it in ways that significantly reduce the benefits," said Robert D. Reischauer, a Democrat who used to lead the Congressional Budget Office.
Douglas Holtz-Eakin, another former C.B.O. director, reflects the concern of fellow Republicans in framing the stakes more dramatically. Either the law's health insurance exchanges "can't cut it," he explained, or "it's Katie, bar the door -- we have an explosively growing new program."
Ever since President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal during the Great Depression, the dominant pattern for major entitlements -- the term for government assistance programs open to all who qualify and not subject to annual budget constraints -- has been durability and expansion. That is the record Senator Ted Cruz of Texas refers to in warning Republicans not to allow Americans to become "hooked on the subsidies" -- an argument Mr. Obama sarcastically recast as, "We've got to stop it before people like it too much."
Congress enacted Social Security in 1935 to provide benefits to retired workers. In 1939, benefits were extended to their dependents and survivors. Later the program grew to provide disability coverage, cover self-employed farmers and raise benefit levels.
President Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society created Medicare and Medicaid in the 1960s to provide health coverage for the elderly and the poor. They followed the same pattern.
In 1972, Congress extended Medicare eligibility to those under 65 on disability and with end-stage renal disease. In 2003, Congress passed President George W. Bush's plan to offer coverage under Medicare for prescription drugs.
Lawmakers initially linked Medicaid coverage to those receiving welfare benefits, but over time expanded eligibility to other "poverty-related groups" such as pregnant women. In 1997, President Bill Clinton signed into law the Children's Health Insurance Program, which now covers eight million children whose families' incomes are too high to qualify for Medicaid.
"You pull more people in, and the benefits become more generous," Mr. Holtz-Eakin said. "Congress knows how to fix an inequity -- write a check."
Those expansions only partly explain why spending on government assistance programs -- which also include welfare, food stamps, farm subsidies and federal retirement -- has grown to 56 percent last year from less than 30 percent of federal spending in 1962, according to the Congressional Research Service. The biggest reasons: the aging of the population, which has swollen the rolls of Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid (which also covers nursing home care), and the steady growth in the cost of health care.
Lawmakers have, in rare circumstances, shown the willingness and ability to pare back entitlements. The one recent reversal of a major entitlement occurred just a year after enactment. In 1989, older Americans irate over higher taxes pushed Congress to repeal the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act that President Ronald Reagan had signed in 1988.
In 1996, Mr. Clinton and a Republican Congress converted federal welfare benefits into a block grant to states and introduced time limits for eligibility.
"That was for a population that has little political power," Mr. Reischauer said. The same is true for the current effort by congressional Republicans to sharply cut food assistance spending for the poor.
More influential constituencies, such as the agriculture industry, have greater ability to push back.
The Cato Institute notes that, having curbed farm subsidies in 1996, Congress later expanded them again by adding new crops to the rolls and creating a "countercyclical" price guarantee. In the same farm bill debate on cutting food stamps this summer, the House embraced higher payments to some farmers, including wealthy ones.
Mr. Obama has already raised the possibility of raising the cost of the health law by saying he has directed aides to explore relief for some customers now facing rate increases. Major employers could raise costs further by choosing to stop providing coverage for their workers, making more Americans eligible for federal subsidies.
Some Republicans see the prospect of metastasizing costs under the law as no accident.
"They see it as a subterfuge leading to single-payer," government-run health care, said Ron Haskins, a former Republican congressional aide and adviser to Mr. Bush. Mr. Haskins, a key figure in the 1996 welfare overhaul, said Republicans should aim to limit the cost of subsidies rather than repeal the law.
The political system's heightened focus on deficit reduction lately has increased the odds that a strategy to restrain spending could work. Moreover, some recent trends in entitlement spending point toward the possibility of slower long-term growth.
Medicare's 10-year-old prescription drug program has cost less than forecast. Republicans credit the effects of the program's reliance on market forces; Democrats point toward lower than expected enrollment and increased use of generic alternatives to major drugs whose patents have expired.
More important, health cost inflation over all has slowed in recent years, curbing expected growth in Medicare and Medicaid expenses. The durability and sources of that trend remain unclear; some experts point to short-term effects of a weak economy, others to changes in medical industry reimbursement practices that the health law has encouraged.
So long as it lasts, however, the trend offers hope of offsetting the long-term liabilities that budget pessimists have come to fear from major entitlement programs.
"That's the $64 trillion question," said Mr. Reischauer, one of two public trustees of the Social Security and Medicare programs. "I have no idea what the bottom line will be on that."

Abstract: Mr. Mishel's preferred explanation of inequality's rise is institutional: a shrinking minimum wage cut into the earnings of the nation's least-skilled workers while falling trade barriers, deregulation and the decline of labor unions eroded the income of the middle class.

Full text:   Many Americans have come to doubt the proposition that college delivers a path to prosperity.
In a poll conducted last month by the College Board and National Journal, 46 percent of respondents -- including more than half of 18- to 29-year-olds -- said a college degree was not needed to be successful. Only 40 percent of Americans think college is a good investment, according to a 2011 poll by the Pew Research Center.
On a pure dollars-and-cents basis, the doubters are wrong. Despite a weak job market for recent graduates, workers with a bachelor's degree still earn almost twice as much as high school graduates. College might be more expensive than ever, but a degree is worth about $365,000 over a lifetime, after defraying all the direct and indirect costs of going to school. This is a higher payoff than in any other advanced nation, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
Still, the growing skepticism about the value of a degree has fed into a deeper unease among some economists about the ironclad trust that policy makers, alongside many academics, have vested in higher education as the weapon of choice to battle widening income disparities and improve the prospects of the middle class in the United States.
It has given new vigor to a critique, mostly by thinkers on the left of the political spectrum, that challenges the idea that educational disparities are a main driver of economic inequality.
"It is absolutely clear that educational wage differentials have not driven wage inequality over the last 15 years," said Lawrence Mishel, who heads the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal-leaning center for economic policy analysis. "Wage inequality has grown a lot over the last 15 years and the educational wage premium has changed little."
The standard analysis of the interplay between technology and education, developed by economists like Lawrence Katz and Claudia Goldin of Harvard, and David Autor of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is based on a simple proposition: Technological progress increased the demand for highly educated workers who could deploy it profitably, increasing their incomes. Like trade, it rendered many less-skilled occupations obsolete, eliminating what used to be solid, middle-class jobs.
This rendition of history suggests that improvements in technology -- coupled with a college graduation rate that slowed sharply in the 1980s -- have been principal drivers of the nation's widening income gap, leaving workers with less education behind.
But critics like Mr. Mishel point out that this theory has important blind spots.
For instance, why have wages for college graduates stagnated over the last decade, even as innovation continues at a breathtaking pace? Between 2000 and 2008 the typical earnings of men with at least a bachelor's degree fell by more than $2,000, after inflation, to $70,332 a year. Between 2008 and last year they fell a further $3,500. Though somewhat less pronounced, the pattern is similar for women.
Both sides agree that the overall weakness of the job market since the turn of the millennium is a prime culprit. As Professor Katz noted: "The only moments we've had of broadly shared prosperity have been in tight labor markets."
Still, the sluggish job growth of the last decade -- following the rapid expansion during the second half of the 1990s -- demands an explanation, which the interplay between technology and skill does not provide.
"We have no handle on what happened in the 2000s," Professor Autor told me. "That is a mystery that nobody I know understands, and I can't point to a single policy lever or a single external force that would explain it."
Most notably, the skills-and-tech story leaves aside one of the most perplexing and important dynamics of the last 30 years: the rise of the 1 percent, a tiny sliver of the population that last year took in almost a dollar out of every $4 generated by the American economy.
"I don't think the college to noncollege wage premium gives you any insight into why such a large share of the economic gains has accrued to such a tiny share of the population," said David Card, a noted labor economist at the University of California, Berkeley.
Mr. Mishel's preferred explanation of inequality's rise is institutional: a shrinking minimum wage cut into the earnings of the nation's least-skilled workers while falling trade barriers, deregulation and the decline of labor unions eroded the income of the middle class. The rise of the top 1 percent, he believes, is mostly about executive pay and the growing footprint of finance.
In coming weeks, Mr. Mishel and two co-authors, Heidi Shierholz of the Economic Policy Institute and John Schmitt of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, expect to publish a study called "Don't Blame the Robots: Assessing the Job Polarization Explanation of Growing Wage Inequality."
In a conversation, Mr. Mishel argued that while education would improve workers' economic mobility, if the ever-deepening concentration of income has little to do with the education gap, more education is unlikely to close it.
"Kids should still go to college, and when a whole lot more do we'll have more opportunity," he said. "But college wages will fall," he added, as the supply of graduates increases. "This won't really bring us broad-based wage growth, which is the central challenge to getting improved social mobility and expanding/rebuilding the middle class."
When it comes to policy, however, the debate about the specific role that education and other factors play in deepening income inequality may contribute less light than heat.
Professors Katz and Autor agree that an array of policies is needed to address the labor market's lopsided distribution of economic rewards. They range from a higher minimum wage to help lift the income of service workers at the bottom of the market to a larger earned-income tax credit.
More technical training could help upgrade the skills of high school graduates. Steeper income taxes on the very rich could curb the accumulation of income at the top. Perhaps most important, the design of macroeconomic policies might give more weight to maintaining low unemployment.
"Education is certainly part of the answer, but it is certainly not a complete answer," Professor Katz said.
There is good reason to resist the proposition that education and technology are solely responsible for growing inequality. It provides political leaders an excuse to cast the problem as beyond the reach of policy.
"It can suck all the air out of the conversation," Professor Autor acknowledged. "All economists should be pushing back against this simplistic view."
Still, education plays a crucial role. A study a few years ago by Thomas Lemieux at the University of British Columbia concluded that increases in the returns on a college education accounted for almost 60 percent of the change in wage inequality between 1973 and 2005.
While Professor Lemieux's data excluded the top few percent of earners, there is a lot of room for improvement left over.
Professor Katz illustrates this with a nifty calculation. Between 1979 and 2012 the share of national income captured by the richest 1 percent of taxpayers increased from 10 percent to 22.5 percent. Had their share instead remained at 10 percent and the rest been distributed equitably among taxpayers in the bottom 99 percent, each would have $7,105 more to spend.
By contrast, between 1979 and 2012 the gap between the annual wages of a typical family of two full-time workers with college degrees and one made up of two high school graduates grew by $30,000, after inflation.
"Nothing we do with the education supply will have a big impact among the top 1 percent," Professor Katz said. But "could it improve the upward mobility and the prospects of a better job for Americans born in the bottom half of the income distribution? Yes."

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The cash-short United States Postal Service, which has failed to win congressional approval to stop delivering mail on Saturdays to save money, has struck a deal with the online retailer Amazon.com to deliver the company's packages on Sundays -- a first for both, with obvious advantages for each.
For the Postal Service, which lost nearly $16 billion last year, first-class mail delivery, particularly on Saturdays, is often a money loser, whereas package delivery is profitable.
The deal, announced on Sunday and taking effect immediately, in time for the holiday shopping season, gives the Postal Service a chance to take some business from United Parcel Service and FedEx, which do not deliver on Sundays. Now, some orders that would have been handled by either of those carriers for Monday delivery will go through the Postal Service and arrive on Sunday.
The Postal Service said it expected to make more such deals with other merchants, seeking a larger role in the $186 billion e-commerce market. Amazon.com would not say if it would try to arrange Sunday deliveries with other parcel carriers.
For this holiday shopping season, Sunday delivery of Amazon products will be limited to the Los Angeles and New York metropolitan areas, which in New York's case includes parts of New Jersey and Connecticut. In 2014 it is expected to expand to other cities including Dallas, Houston, New Orleans and Phoenix.
Among the primary beneficiaries of the new delivery schedule will be Amazon Prime members, who pay an annual fee for premium services including free two-day shipping for certain items, said Kelly Cheeseman, a spokeswoman for Amazon. "Now every day can be an Amazon delivery day," Ms. Cheeseman said.
Postal Service officials called the agreement an important step in diversifying its services and expanding those that make a profit. "Consumers have shown that there is a market for package deliveries seven days a week, and we are glad to be in a position to partner with Amazon on providing this service," said Patrick R. Donahoe, the postmaster general.
Neither Amazon nor the Postal Service would disclose financial arrangements or discuss the volume or revenue they expected to generate from Sunday deliveries. The Postal Service already delivers some packages on Sundays and holidays for an extra fee.
Shipping and package services have been one of the few bright spots for the beleaguered Postal Service. First-class mail, its main source of revenue, declined to almost 69 billion pieces last year from nearly 92 billion in 2008.
That contributed to a decline in revenue to $65 billion in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, 2012, from nearly $75 billion in 2008. Shipping and package volume has increased to about 3.5 billion pieces since 2008, and accounts for about $11.6 billion in revenue for the agency.
Mr. Donahoe, the postmaster general, said the deal with Amazon was part of the Postal Service's attempt to alter its business model. That effort includes increasing package delivery to take advantage of the growth of e-commerce, streamlining the work force and eliminating mail delivery on Saturdays.
Though the Postal Service would continue to deliver packages on Saturdays, the proposal to halt Saturday delivery has met resistance from the business sector and some members of Congress. A move to cut Saturday delivery would save about $2 billion annually, postal officials said.
The agency faces myriad problems that have led to its financial decline. It faces legal constraints that prevent it from diversifying into certain lines of business. It is also barred from raising postage prices faster than the rate of inflation.
But an even bigger cause of the financial decline is a 2006 law that requires the Postal Service, unlike any other government agency, to pay $5.5 billion a year into a health fund for its future retirees. The majority of the agency's losses since 2007, about $32 billion, result from the health funding requirement, financial documents show.
As a result of its financial troubles, the Postal Service has defaulted on three annual $5.5 billion payments into the health care fund. It has also exhausted its $15 billion borrowing limit from the Treasury Department. More recently the agency has asked for permission to raise its postage prices to help cover costs.
Congress is considering legislation that would overhaul the agency and ease the financial constraints, but few anticipate a bill passing this year as lawmakers continue to wrestle with broader budget issues.
"We've got to get this done," Mr. Donahoe said. "The faster we can get it done, the faster we can focus attention away from all the negative attention about our financial situation and onto the positive things we do, like this new agreement with Amazon."

Full text:   CARACAS, Venezuela -- The Christmas shopping season has started with a jolt here, with the socialist Venezuelan government dispatching soldiers to "occupy" a major chain of electronic goods stores, ordering prices slashed there and in other shops that it has accused of price gouging.
Huge crowds formed outside stores in several cities over the weekend as inflation-weary Venezuelans showed up hoping for bargains. Others took the government's order as a license to loot: Some posted cellphone videos online showing large-screen televisions and other items being carted off in Valencia, the country's third-largest city.
The dramatic measures, ordered on Friday by President Nicolás Maduro, were reminiscent of the populist gestures of his immediate predecessor, Hugo Chávez, the country's longtime leader who died in March.
They come as the government grapples with serious economic problems, including inflation of 54 percent a year and shortages of many basic goods, including toilet paper, milk and flour.
All of that is weighing on Mr. Maduro a month ahead of municipal elections that the opposition is seeking to cast as a referendum on his young government. Mr. Maduro argues that his government is facing an "economic war" waged by what he calls the right-wing opposition in Venezuela and its backers in Colombia and the United States.
In announcing that military personnel would occupy the five-store electronics chain Daka, Mr. Maduro said that the government would supervise sales at significantly lower prices and that the store's stock would be liquidated.
"Let nothing remain on the shelves!" he said during a television broadcast.
Mr. Maduro also dispatched officials to inspect other stores around the country, saying they, too, would be forced to charge what the government considers fair prices.
Officials said over the weekend that several store managers had been arrested and would face charges of setting overly high prices. Luisa Ortega, the national prosecutor, said that some people had also been arrested and accused of looting.
Vice President Jorge Arreaza, who is married to one of Mr. Chávez's daughters, said on Twitter on Sunday that the campaign against what the government calls speculators would continue forcefully. "We will protect the PEOPLE against bourgeois parasitism," he wrote, echoing language often used by Mr. Maduro.
Henrique Capriles Radonski, the opposition leader whom Mr. Maduro narrowly beat in an election to replace Mr. Chávez in April, criticized the measures on his Twitter account, writing, "Maduro in desperation over his failure and inability to lead the country takes measures that do not solve the economic crisis."
The crowds forming outside stores over the weekend included both government loyalists and opponents. What they shared was a growing frustration with the country's economic malaise and prices that keep soaring, fostering anger with both the government and merchants.
The main government television station on Sunday repeatedly showed video clips in which Hebert García, the head of the recently created Supreme Organ for the Popular Defense of the Economy, and other officials vowed to keep up the pressure on so-called speculators.

Full text:   SAN FRANCISCO -- David Soloff is recruiting an army of "hyperdata" collectors.
The company he co-founded, Premise, created a smartphone application that is now used by 700 people in 25 developing countries. Using guidance from Mr. Soloff and his co-workers, these people, mostly college students and homemakers, photograph food and goods in public markets.
By analyzing the photos of prices and the placement of everyday items like piles of tomatoes and bottles of shampoo and matching that to other data, Premise is building a real-time inflation index to sell to companies and Wall Street traders, who are hungry for insightful data.
"Within five years, I'd like to have 3,000 or 4,000 people doing this," said Mr. Soloff, who is also Premise's chief executive. "It's a useful global inflation monitor, a way of looking at food security, or a way a manufacturer can judge what kind of shelf space he is getting."
Collecting data from all sorts of odd places and analyzing it much faster than was possible even a couple of years ago has become one of the hottest areas of the technology industry. The idea is simple: With all that processing power and a little creativity, researchers should be able to find novel patterns and relationships among different kinds of information.
For the last few years, insiders have been calling this sort of analysis Big Data. Now Big Data is evolving, becoming more "hyper" and including all sorts of sources. Start-ups like Premise and ClearStory Data, as well as larger companies like General Electric, are getting into the act.
A picture of a pile of tomatoes in Asia may not lead anyone to a great conclusion other than how tasty those tomatoes may or may not look. But connect pictures of food piles around the world to weather forecasts and rainfall totals and you have meaningful information that people like stockbrokers or buyers for grocery chains could use.
And the faster that happens, the better, so people can make smart -- and quick -- decisions.
"Hyperdata comes to you on the spot, and you can analyze it and act on it on the spot," said Bernt Wahl, an industry fellow at the Center for Entrepreneurship and Technology at the University of California, Berkeley. "It will be in regular business soon, with everyone predicting and acting the way Amazon instantaneously changes its prices around."
Standard statistics might project next summer's ice cream sales. The aim of people working on newer Big Data systems is to collect seemingly unconnected information like today's heat and cloud cover, and a hometown team's victory over the weekend, compare that with past weather and sports outcomes, and figure out how much mint chip ice cream mothers would buy today.
At least, that is the hope, and there are early signs it could work. Premise claims to have spotted broad national inflation in India months ahead of the government by looking at onion prices in a couple of markets.
The photographers working for Premise are recruited by country managers, and they receive 8 to 10 cents a picture. Premise also gathers time and location information from the phones, plus a few notes on things like whether the market was crowded. The real insight comes from knowing how to mix it all together, quickly.
Price data from the photos gets blended with prices Premise receives from 30,000 websites. The company then builds national inflation indexes and price maps for markets in places like Kolkata, India; Shanghai; and Rio de Janeiro.
Premise's subscribers include Wall Street hedge funds and Procter & Gamble, a company known for using lots of data. None of them would comment for this article. Subscriptions to the service range from $1,500 to more than $15,000 a month, though there is also a version that offers free data to schools and nonprofit groups.
The new Big Data connections are also benefiting from the increasing amount of public information that is available. According to research from the McKinsey Global Institute, 40 national governments now offer data on matters like population and land use. The United States government alone has 90,000 sets of open data.
"There is over $3 trillion of potential benefit from open government economic data, from things like price transparency, competition and benchmarking," said Michael Chui, one of the authors of the McKinsey report. "Sometimes you have to be careful of the quality, but it is valuable."
That government data can be matched with sensors on smartphones, jet engines, even bicycle stations, that are uploading data from across the physical world into the supercomputers of cloud computing systems.
Until a few years ago, much government and private data could not be collected particularly fast or well. It was expensive to get and hard to load into computers. As sensor prices have dropped, however, and things like Wi-Fi have enabled connectivity, that has changed.
In the world of computer hardware, in-memory computing, an advance that allows data to be crunched without being stored in a different location, has increased computing speeds immensely. That has allowed for some real-time data crunching.
General Electric, for example, which has over 200 sensors in a single jet engine, has worked with Accenture to build a business analyzing aircraft performance the moment the jet lands. G.E. also has software that looks at data collected from 100 places on a turbine every second, and combines it with power demand, weather forecasts and labor costs to plot maintenance schedules.
IBM also recently announced commercial deployment of software that learns and predicts the behavior of large, complex systems to improve performance while things are happening.
One customer, an Illinois telecommunications company called Consolidated Communications, uses the software to oversee 80,000 elements of its network, like connectivity speeds and television performance, for each of its 500,000 clients. IBM also announced new products it said would improve analysis and make it easier for customers to work with different kinds of data.
Traditional data analysis was built on looking at regular information, like payroll stubs, that could be loaded into the regular rows and columns of a spreadsheet. With the explosion of the Web, however, companies like Google, Facebook and Yahoo were faced with unprecedented volumes of "unstructured" data, like how people cruised the Web or comments they made to their friends.
New hardware and software have also been created that sharply cut the time it takes to analyze this information, fetching it as fast as an iPhone fetches a song.
Last month, creators of the Spark open-source software, which speeds data analysis by 100 times compared with existing systems, received $14 million to start a company that would offer a commercial version of that software.
ClearStory Data, a start-up based in Palo Alto, Calif., has introduced a product that can look at data on the fly from different sources. With ClearStory, data on movie ticket sales, for example, might be mixed with information on weather, even Twitter messages, and presented as a shifting bar chart or a map, depending on what the customer is trying to figure out. There is even a "data you might like" feature, which suggests new sources of information to try.
The trick, said Sharmila Shahani-Mulligan, ClearStory's co-founder and chief executive, was developing a way to quickly and accurately find all of the data sources available. Another was figuring out how to present data on, say, typical weather in a community, in a way that was useful.
"That way," said Ms. Shahani-Mulligan, "a coffee shop can tell if customers will drink Red Bull or hot chocolate."

Talk of Penalty Is Missing in Ads For Health Care

Abstract: While the mandate for all Americans to buy health insurance -- with a penalty if they do not -- was the linchpin of the Supreme Court decision upholding the law, and is considered the key to its success, poll after poll has found that it is also the least popular part of the program.

Full text:   New York's health exchange slogan is "Today's the Day." Minnesota has enlisted Paul Bunyan. Oregon held a music contest, and California stresses the "peace of mind" that will come with insurance.
The state and federal health insurance exchanges are using all manner of humor and happy talk to sell the Affordable Care Act's products. But the one part of the new system that they are not quick to trumpet is the financial penalty that Americans will face if they fail to buy insurance.
On state exchange websites, mention of the penalty is typically tucked away under "frequently asked questions," if it appears at all. Television and print ads usually skip the issue, and operators of exchange telephone banks are instructed to discuss it only if asked. The federal website, now infamous for its glitches, mentions the penalty but also calls it a fee, or an Individual Shared Responsibility Payment.
The euphemisms and avoidance of any discussion of the penalty are no accident, both supporters and critics of the law say. While the mandate for all Americans to buy health insurance -- with a penalty if they do not -- was the linchpin of the Supreme Court decision upholding the law, and is considered the key to its success, poll after poll has found that it is also the least popular part of the program.
State exchange operators say that they are not trying to hide the penalty, but that their market research has taught them that, at least in the initial phase, consumers will be more receptive to soothing messages and appeals to their sense of collective responsibility than to threats of punishment.
"We feel that the carrot is better than the stick," said Larry Hicks, a spokesman for Covered California. "This is a new endeavor. We want people to come in and test our wares."
But there is also the dirty little secret of the penalty: It is a bit of a chimera, because the federal government cannot use its usual tools like fines, liens or criminal prosecutions to punish people who do not pay it. The penalty is supposed to be reported and paid with the income tax returns of those who do not buy insurance, but the government has not said how it will collect from those who owe it but do not pay it, though the law allows it to deduct from any income tax refunds.
"It might be that they want to be positive," said Michael Cannon, director of health policy studies at the conservative Cato Institute. "But it's also the case that an informed customer is not their best customer."
And for many healthy middle-class people, a side-by-side comparison might suggest that it would be more cost-effective to pay the penalty than to buy insurance.
In 2014, a family with two adults and two or more children, for example, would pay $285 or 1 percent of the family's income over the $20,300 filing threshold, whichever is greater; those jump to $2,085 or 2.5 percent by 2016 and rise with inflation after that.
For instance, a family of four making $59,000 a year could face a choice between a $387 penalty the first year or, in a typical "silver" or midpriced policy offered on the California exchange, a premium of nearly $4,800 after the federal subsidy, with a $4,000 deductible, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation subsidy calculator. There is variation from plan to plan, but the deductible typically would not apply to doctor visits, preventive care, lab tests or generic drugs, although some regular co-payments would apply.
"Are they going to buy it?" said Robert Laszewski, president of Health Policy and Strategy Associates, a health care industry consultant in Alexandria, Va. "I don't mean this as an attack on Obamacare. I think it's a difficult political problem."
The federal website, which serves residents of 36 states, appears to acknowledge this problem in a not-quite-threatening way: "If someone who can afford health insurance doesn't have coverage in 2014, they may have to pay a fee. They also have to pay for all of their health care."
The penalty, despite its unpopularity, is the glue that holds the Affordable Care Act together. Unless people are forced to buy insurance, health policy experts say, young and healthy people may stay away, leaving only the more expensive patients in the plans, which will quickly drive up premiums. And it was the penalty that the United States Supreme Court relied on to uphold the individual mandate, reasoning that it was a legal use of Congress's taxing authority.
The sotto-voce treatment of the penalty resembles the strategy Massachusetts used when it set up its universal health insurance program several years ago. It took a sales approach at first, using the Red Sox in its campaign to appeal to men, who tend to be a little more resentful of being pushed into something, said Jon Kingsdale, the executive director for the first four years.
In November 2007, with barely two months left to sign up, his state began emphasizing the penalty, and volume soared, he said. "That was very effective as a call to action," Mr. Kingsdale said.
Directors of state exchanges said that as happened in Massachusetts, a new phase of advertising that incorporates the penalty may kick in as the sign-up deadline approaches. Last month, the Obama administration said people who signed up for coverage by March 31 would avoid the penalty; previously the date was Feb. 15.
Some people are exempt from the penalty, including those with religious objections to insurance or with incomes too low to require a tax return, and those who cannot find a plan costing less than 8 percent of their income.
Officials at the Health and Human Services Department, which runs the federal exchange, would not answer questions about the marketing of the penalty.
But officials at Enroll America, a nonprofit agency that is promoting the new marketplace, said they were deliberately playing down the penalty in favor of themes that tested well with focus groups: financial assistance, core benefits, no one being turned away for pre-existing conditions, and easy comparison shopping. "That doesn't mean that the penalty or the mandate isn't an important piece of the law from a policy perspective," said Sophie Stern, a senior policy analyst for the agency. "But from a messaging perspective, this is what we find resonates best."
The approach is evident in a vast expanse of cubicles in an office park outside Albany, with panoramic views of low-lying mountains, where dozens of newly hired customer service representatives answer the calls of New Yorkers with questions about the state's exchange.
They rattle off information about the "metal levels" -- bronze, silver, gold and platinum plans -- and deductibles and copays. But they are not supposed to volunteer that by law, having health insurance is now mandatory for most people. If someone asks -- and occasionally people do, the customer service agents say -- they pull up a script that says, "The Affordable Care Act requires that if you can afford health coverage, you must get coverage or pay a penalty."
Donna Frescatore, executive director of New York's exchange, said focus groups preferred positive messaging, hence the state's message, "Today's the day that you can have information." The campaign, she said, "is about health as opposed to the burden of illness."
Likewise, Minnesota has gone upbeat with its humorous ads, which feature a replica of a roadside Paul Bunyan statue suffering various injuries. Oregon has a YouTube video in which Laura Gibson, a folk singer, wearing a red dress and strumming a guitar, stands in a green field as she sings about living in a place "where I'm free to be healthy and happy and strong."
"We don't have any messaging related to the penalty or the mandate, and that's intentional," said Amy Fauver, a spokeswoman for Cover Oregon, the state exchange. "Because first of all, we don't enforce it, it's really not ours to enforce, and we really feel like there is so much to celebrate in terms of benefits."

Full text:   CARACAS, Venezuela -- The Venezuelan authorities on Saturday released an American journalist who had been detained and questioned by military intelligence officials.
The journalist, Jim Wyss, is the Andes region bureau chief for The Miami Herald. He was detained Thursday near Venezuela's western border with Colombia while on a reporting trip.
In a telephone interview in Caracas, where he was released, Mr. Wyss said the authorities who had questioned him never explained to him why he had been detained. He said that he had been treated well and that he would be allowed to remain in Venezuela and continue his work as a journalist.
Officials with the Information Ministry did not respond to requests for comment.
Mr. Wyss lives in Bogotá, Colombia, but periodically visits Venezuela.
He said he was detained on Thursday in San Cristóbal, a western city, after going to a National Guard site to seek information for an article.
"They decided to dig deeper into who I was," Mr. Wyss said. He was first handed over to military intelligence officers and eventually to immigration officials, he said. He was brought to Caracas on Friday.
"I think the release could be an acknowledgment that I wasn't doing anything wrong," Mr. Wyss said. "I think there was a lot of tension along the border, and I got scooped up in it. It became clear to them I was just a reporter trying to do a job."
Venezuela is struggling with economic problems, including a 54 percent annual inflation rate and shortages of basic goods. President Nicolás Maduro says right-wing enemies here, in Colombia and in the United States are waging an economic war against his socialist government.
He and other officials have suggested that the local and foreign news media are conspiring against the government.
In a television appearance last week, the information minister, Delcy Rodríguez, said several news media outlets, including The Miami Herald and The New York Times, portrayed Venezuela as a country in crisis. She accused the international news media of following "this script of a continuous and silent coup in Venezuela."

Full text:   PARIS -- President FranÃ§ois Hollande suffered another setback on Friday, as Standard & Poor's cut France's credit rating, saying it did not believe the government's current policy course would restore growth.
S. P. cut the credit rating to AA from AA+, arguing that the government's actions in areas like taxation and the labor market would probably not have much positive impact on the country's medium-term growth and that "high unemployment is weakening support for further significant fiscal and structural policy measures."
Markets greeted the news with calm: French bond yields ticked up modestly and the euro was almost unchanged. The rate cut, in a week in which France's own economic projections were questioned by officials in Brussels, did nothing more than confirm a widely held view that France was making little headway in reviving its economy.
But coming on the same day as a surprisingly robust jobs report in the United States, the downgrade underscored the sharp contrast between a country apparently on the rebound and one -- France, second only to Germany as Europe's biggest economy -- struggling to restore the momentum that has been missing since the 2008 financial crisis.
Holger Schmieding, chief economist in London for the German bank Berenberg, said the lack of progress in France, especially compared with turnaround efforts in smaller, weaker euro zone countries like Spain, Portugal, Ireland and Greece, "makes it ever more obvious that France is Europe's real problem."
Mr. Schmieding, in a research note, said it was unlikely that France would face a major crisis because its finances were in better shape than most countries'. Instead, France was condemning itself "to further long-term decline," he said.
The French economy expanded by 0.5 percent in the second quarter of 2013 from the first three months of the year, for an annualized rate of about 2 percent. But unemployment, at 11.1 percent, weighs heavily on growth and on efforts to reduce the budget deficit that are mandated under European Union rules.
Mr. Hollande, a Socialist, has long been seen as a reluctant follower of Europe's rigorous budget orthodoxy. While he has employed a de facto austerity policy since taking office, he has sought to reduce the deficit spending gap mainly by raising taxes. That approach may be nearing its limits as the electorate questions whether it can afford to pay for the state's major role in the economy, and Mr. Hollande's poll ratings are at a record low.
S. P. said that the outlook for France's credit rating was "stable," reflecting its expectation that the government would hold debt in check. But S. P. also said it expected government spending to remain above 56 percent of gross domestic product through 2015, the highest in the 17-nation euro zone, and second only to Denmark among developed nations.
Many economists say that France has no choice but to start seriously addressing the government spending side of the equation, though French officials worry that reducing government demand in the current environment would further depress growth.
As downgrades go, this one does not hold the symbolic value of the one in January 2012, when S. P. was the first of the major agencies to withdraw France's coveted AAA rating under former President Nicolas Sarkozy. The other two -- Moody's Investors Service and Fitch Ratings -- then followed suit.
Jean-FranÃ§ois CopÃ©, president of the center-right UMP party, said the downgrade "points clearly at this government's inability to cut public spending, stop the rise in unemployment and carry out structural reforms in our country."
Mr. Hollande nonetheless expressed his determination Friday to continue with his policies, telling a World Bank news conference in Paris, "I will confirm this strategy which is ours, the course of which is mine."
The S. P. downgrade was the second embarrassment in the past week for the government. On Tuesday, Olli Rehn, the European Union's head of economic policy, predicted that joblessness in France would increase until 2015, contradicting French forecasts that showed unemployment peaking this year.
Weakness in France and elsewhere in the euro zone, as well as alarming signs that inflation was declining to levels that might signal the onset of deflation, led the European Central Bank on Thursday to cut its benchmark interest rate to 0.25 percent from 0.5 percent.
Echoing what many government officials have declared lately, Mr. Hollande said his policy rested on the continuation of reforms that had already been undertaken. He has been credited with measures to make the labor market more flexible and has taken up the thorny issue of pension reform. But a planned "fiscal revolution" to rationalize government finance fizzled in September, much as Mr. Sarkozy's plans before his.
Still, the practical impact of the S. P. move would appear to be limited. In theory, a lower rating could mean the government's borrowing costs will rise, something that would be most unwelcome at a time when the government is trying to reduce its deficit to 3 percent of gross domestic product.
On Friday, Mr. Hollande argued that the proof of confidence in the reforms was in the low interest rates investors were demanding to hold French debt. The benchmark French 10-year bond was yielding about 2.23 percent on Friday, up seven-hundredths of a percentage point. That is among the lowest of major economies, and lower than the United States, where the 10-year Treasury was at 2.73 percent. But it remains above the equivalent German government debt, seen as the safest in the euro zone, which was trading to yield 1.7 percent.
Today, just a handful of major nations have a triple-A ranking, the highest, from all three agencies, among them Germany, Norway and Switzerland. The United States lost its AAA rating with S. P. in August 2011. The ratings agencies, however, have lost much of the standing they once enjoyed, having been widely criticized for enabling the financial engineering that Wall Street used to turn subprime mortgages and other risky loans into top-rated financial products during the global credit bubble.
"The bottom line is that it's irrelevant in every other respect than pride," Erik Nielsen, global chief economist at UniCredit in London, said of the downgrade.
France still enjoys an investment-grade rating, Mr. Nielsen said, so the change will not trigger clauses for automatic selling by fund managers whose charters require that they hold only high-quality debt. Nor, he added, does France have the kind of fiscal or current-account imbalances that are "requirements" for a crisis.
Mr. Schmieding said there were even grounds for optimism. He said he was hopeful that as the French political elite became more conscious of how economic stagnation was reducing the country's weight in European affairs, the policy debate would move toward addressing its problems.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- It started off as yet another staid International Monetary Fund conference on financial crises, filled with ample praise for one of its high-wattage speakers, Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, and carefully calibrated comments on optimal monetary policy.
Enter Lawrence H. Summers.
Now that he is no longer a candidate to head the Federal Reserve, Mr. Summers -- who withdrew from consideration this fall in the face of stiff resistance in Congress, with the White House ultimately nominating Janet L. Yellen -- was perhaps freer to speak in his trademark blunt style. And he didn't disappoint, arguing that by many important metrics, policy has failed.
Mr. Summers underscored how weak the economy remains, despite the extensive stimulus and the Fed's continuing campaign of asset purchases, with the labor market slack and inflation subdued.
"My lesson from this crisis is, my overarching lesson is that it's not over until it is over, and that is surely not right now," he said.
He noted that short-term interest rates had remained close to zero for years, with no end in sight: "We may well need in the years ahead to think about how we manage an economy in which the zero nominal interest rate is a chronic and systemic inhibitor of economic activity."
"There's no evidence of growth that is restoring equilibrium," Mr. Summers added. "One has to be concerned about a policy agenda that is doing less with monetary policy than has been done before, doing less with fiscal policy than has been done before," and is "taking steps whose basic purpose is to cause there to be less lending, borrowing and inflated asset prices than there was before."
It was, in essence, a call for a revitalized, crisis-style campaign to improve the economy, especially to get young people to work. Elements might include major public investment, he said.
Mr. Bernanke raised some objections in an unusual back-and-forth that had the room riveted. He pointed to a theory that interest rates could not remain negative in perpetuity, as a counter to Mr. Summers's comments. At the same time, he called the comments "fascinating."
Later, Mr. Bernanke said that the unemployment rate, at 7.3 percent, might not be capturing the extent of the problems in the labor market, arguing that the "Federal Reserve in particular is taking strong actions to support job creation." He also said that student loan debt was a "serious issue" though he did not expect it to have a destabilizing financial effect. But he generally shied away from commenting on current economic conditions or on the Fed's efforts to stimulate the economy.
In his opening statements, Mr. Bernanke, who was a scholar of the Great Depression before he became a central banker, drew parallels between the 2008 panic and one that happened a century before, before the Fed even existed.
The other participants at the Fed conference were Stanley Fischer, an American economist who formerly led Israel's central bank; Kenneth Rogoff, an economist at Harvard and a financial historian; and Olivier Blanchard, the I.M.F.'s chief economist.
In his comments, Mr. Fischer said that the crisis had shown how much central banks could do to stimulate growth even after bringing interest rates all the way down to zero. He praised Mr. Bernanke for creating a new playbook for crisis response, and warned about the difficulty of identifying problems early enough to prevent serious damage.
Mr. Rogoff discussed the outstanding questions of how to bail out financial institutions and how to write down the value of toxic assets. He also stressed the importance of differentiating between insolvent financial institutions and ones just suffering from short-term difficulties.
But Mr. Summers ended up being the most outspoken and vocal participant. Toward the end, he added that nobody involved in crisis response -- Mr. Summers was a top economic adviser to President Obama during his early years in office -- felt fully satisfied. But he saw a silver lining: There is little chance of another financial crisis anytime soon.
He said that most crises are preceded by "complacency and euphoria." Thus, a new one might be far off.

Abstract: [...]Mr. Hatzius said he expected the Fed would hold off on raising short-term rates from near zero until early 2016.

Full text:   Despite dysfunction in Washington and a 16-day government shutdown, the economy chugged along in October, surprising many analysts as private sector hiring bounced back after a spring slowdown.
The latest figures, along with upward revisions for job creation in August and September released by the Labor Department on Friday, lifted the estimated monthly pace of hiring to 202,000 over the last three months. If that strength persists, the Federal Reserve will probably feel comfortable enough to begin easing back on its stimulus efforts, economists said, though probably not as early as its next meeting in December.
Over all, experts said the new data showed an economy with more underlying strength than first thought, but not necessarily growing as fast as many policy makers would like.
"Sometimes it's a little faster, sometimes it's a little slower," said Guy Berger, United States economist at RBS. "The labor market is in decent shape, but it's not doing that much better than six months or a year ago."
Still, the addition of 204,000 nonfarm jobs in October eased fears about the impact of the shutdown and prompted some usually cautious observers to wonder whether the economy was finally finding its footing after four years of on-again, off-again growth.
"Maybe this is the beginning of that long-awaited period of better growth for the economy," said Ethan Harris, co-head of global economics at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. "October was remarkably resilient."
Although strong economic reports -- by raising expectations of a quicker move by the Fed to rein in its extra stimulus -- have sometimes spooked markets in the past, stocks surged on Friday as traders bet healthier growth and rising earnings would offset any damping effect caused by any Fed retreat.
Some market veterans, however, recommended keeping the champagne on ice.
"It's not a watershed yet," said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial in Chicago. "A few more months like this could make it a watershed. We need at least another month of good data and some confidence in fiscal policy for the Fed to pull the trigger in December."
A separate question from the timing of the Fed tapering, which affects longer-term interest rates for loans like mortgages, is when the central bank will begin raising short-term interest rates from their current rock-bottom levels.
The Fed has signaled that will not happen before unemployment falls to 6.5 percent, suggesting no move until at least 2015. But now experts like Jan Hatzius of Goldman Sachs say they think policy makers will decrease that threshold to 6 percent or perhaps even lower. As a result, Mr. Hatzius said he expected the Fed would hold off on raising short-term rates from near zero until early 2016.
The payroll data come from a monthly survey of employers, and the Labor Department said on Friday that there were "no discernible impacts of the partial federal government shutdown" on these figures, which came out a week behind schedule. If anything, analysts said, the delay in conducting the survey could have added to the numbers. But the unemployment rate, based on a separate survey of households that counted furloughed federal employees as out of work, rose to 7.3 percent in October from 7.2 percent in September.
One mystery buried in Friday's report was a drop of 720,000 in the size of the labor force, and the ensuing fall in the labor participation rate to 62.8 percent, a 35-year low.
The labor participation rate has been falling in recent years as discouraged workers have dropped out of the work force, others have decided to stay in school or stay home to take care of children, and the number of retirements by baby boomers has picked up. But the drop in October was the biggest one-month decline since the end of 2009. A smaller labor force has the effect of making the overall unemployment rate appear lower, but is a troubling sign for the long-term health of the economy.
"We're scratching our heads," said Mr. Berger. "You have to set this aside and look at the November report. Does it reverse? Does it keep declining? To us, it's puzzling."
The economy's ability to seemingly shake off the effects of last month's showdown in Washington left both parties trying to spin the numbers in a way that favored their side.
The White House stuck to its guns, with Jason Furman, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, asserting "there should be no debate that the shutdown and debt limit brinkmanship inflicted unnecessary damage on the economy in October." Thomas Perez, the labor secretary, said in an interview that while the jobs gain was encouraging, "I'm confident we would have had more but for the shutdown."
Representative Kevin Brady, a Texas Republican who is chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, had a very different take. "When the government simply gets out of the way of the private sector, we can see real job growth," he said in a statement. Mr. Brady said the real message in Friday's report was the big decline in the participation rate, "as too many workers have dropped out because they lost hope."
Employment still has a long way to go before returning to its prerecession level, in part because the downturn was so severe and because job gains in this recovery have come more slowly than in past recoveries.
Compared to when the downturn began in December 2007, the number of jobs is still about 1.5 million below that peak, a decline of about 1.1 percent. And that does not account for the fact that the working-age population has continued to grow, meaning that if the economy were healthy, there should be considerably more jobs today than there were before the recession.
Sharp disparities remain evident in the jobs figures. Unemployment for workers over 25 with less than a high school diploma rose to 10.9 percent in October from 10.3 percent in September, while joblessness among college-educated Americans inched up to a modest 3.8 percent from 3.7 percent in the previous month. Similarly, the participation rate for the most educated workers stood at 75 percent, compared with 44.7 percent for the least educated ones.
Average hourly earnings in October rose just 0.1 percent, but over the last year they are up 2.2 percent. That's far less than most workers would like, but with inflation very low, it does suggest some improvement in terms of spending power by consumers.
The bump in job creation for October has many economists and traders already looking ahead to the jobs report for this month, due out Dec. 6, for guidance on whether the stronger gains are sustainable or if the numbers were influenced by any statistical quirks.
Mr. Hatzius, echoing a widespread view of the report, summed it up this way: "2014 is going to be a stronger year for growth but I wouldn't use this report as confirmation of that. There is a lot of noise in there."

Full text:   FRANKFURT -- In an unexpectedly swift reaction to economic warning signals, the European Central Bank cut its benchmark interest rate to a record low on Thursday, moving to head off what some economists fear could be a long period of stagnation like the one that has afflicted Japan.
The cut in the E.C.B.'s main rate to 0.25 percent from 0.5 percent took many analysts by surprise, and seemed intended to reinforce a vow last year by Mario Draghi, the bank's president, to do "whatever it takes" to preserve the euro zone.
The central bank was reacting to a sudden drop in euro zone inflation, which fell to an annual rate of 0.7 percent in October, well below the bank's official target of about 2 percent. The decline raised the specter of deflation, a sustained fall in prices that can destroy the profits of companies and the jobs they provide.
Mr. Draghi insisted that the E.C.B. was not expecting such a catastrophic situation. "If we mean by deflation a self-fulfilling fall in prices across a very large category of goods, and across a very significant number of countries, we don't see that," he said at a news conference. "I don't think it is similar to Japan."
But by moving sooner than expected, Mr. Draghi and the other 22 members of the E.C.B. Governing Council answered critics who have said they are too divisive and reluctant to stimulate the economy as forcefully as the United States Federal Reserve or the Bank of England, neither of which are accountable to a group of individual countries that often have differing economic agendas.
Within the sometimes fractious 17-nation euro currency union, the E.C.B. is the closest thing the euro zone has to a central policy-making agency, and Mr. Draghi has shown a willingness to have it play that role, limited though its powers may be. The rate cut was the first since May and the fifth since Mr. Draghi became the E.C.B.'s president in 2011.
"It was really important to challenge that perception that the E.C.B. is indifferent," said Richard Barwell, an economist at Royal Bank of Scotland who was one of the few to predict a rate cut. "Within their remit, they are willing to do whatever it takes to save the euro."
At the same time, some economists questioned how much the cut would achieve in the absence of any fiscal stimulus from euro zone governments. Countries like Italy and Spain cannot afford to increase government spending, while Germany, which can, is not willing to. That is one reason the euro zone economy is stuck in economic limbo, no longer in recession but barely growing.
"In the end it comes down to the E.C.B.," said Zsolt Darvas, a senior fellow at Bruegel, a research organization in Brussels. "But the E.C.B.'s powers are limited."
Predictably, the rate cut won praise from countries with weak economies -- and drew criticism from Germany, which has a historical aversion to inflation and fears that looser money will lead to profligacy among the euro zone's more financially troubled members.
Pierre Moscovici, the French finance minister, said in a Twitter message that the rate cut provided "welcome support for the ongoing recovery in the euro zone by limiting the risk of deflation."
But a German banking group expressed dismay. "Unprecedented low interest rates substantially devalue savings in Germany and the euro area and increase the danger of bubbles," the Association of German Public Banks said in a statement.
The view in Germany and among some economists is that there is no threat of deflation. This group sees slowing inflation merely as a sign that wages are falling in countries like Spain and Greece, where labor costs had become too high for companies to compete in the international marketplace.
Given those arguments against a rate cut now, Mr. Draghi showed on Thursday that he was willing to overrule German objections. It is likely that Jens Weidmann, president of the German central bank, was among members of the E.C.B. Governing Council who, according to Mr. Draghi, wanted to wait for more information before taking action. Mr. Draghi did not identify the dissenters, though, and the German central bank, the Bundesbank, declined to comment.
European stocks were mixed on the news, with exchanges in Paris and Frankfurt initially up more than 1 percent and then falling flat, while the euro fell more than 1 percent against the dollar. A cheaper euro makes European products less expensive abroad. Mr. Draghi denied that the E.C.B. was deliberately trying to drive down the euro.
The fall in the euro also reflected strong economic data from the United States, where the government said the economy grew at an annual rate of 2.8 percent in the third quarter, significantly better than economists had expected and the fastest pace this year.
Troubled by persistently slow growth and only gradual improvement in the labor market in the United States, the Federal Reserve has kept up its stimulus efforts more intently and for longer than many observers had expected as recently as this summer. The Fed has a dual mandate, promoting employment growth as well as price stability.
The E.C.B.'s prime mandate is to defend price stability, which also means intervening if inflation is too low. But most analysts had expected the E.C.B. to wait until December to act, once there was more economic data available.
"Deflationary risks and the stronger euro seem to have motivated the E.C.B.'s move," Carsten Brzeski, an analyst at ING Bank, said in a note to clients. "It is obvious that the E.C.B. under President Draghi has become much more proactive than under any of his predecessors."
The E.C.B. decision carries some risks. If the economy gets worse, the decision to cut to 0.25 percent leaves the bank with little additional room to maneuver.
Mr. Draghi repeated assurances on Thursday that rates would stay low for an extended period of time. The central bank will also keep supplying banks with cheap loans through mid-2015, he said, but he did not announce a new round of long-term three-year loans.
That is another contrast to the active stimulus tools at the disposal of the United States Fed and the British central bank. On Thursday, the Bank of England said it would continue its program of economic stimulus at 375 billion pounds, or about $600 billion. And unlike the E.C.B., the British bank on Thursday kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged, at a record low of 0.5 percent, amid signs that the country's economic recovery was gaining speed and consumer confidence was improving.
Some economists have argued that falling inflation in the euro zone, coming after five years of recession or very slow growth, means that the currency bloc faces an acute risk of deflation. While lower prices might seem like a good thing for consumers, in fact deflation is considered even more dangerous than runaway inflation. When prices fall, consumers and businesses delay purchases because they expect goods to become even cheaper. Corporate profits decline, and companies are forced to pay their workers less. A spiral begins that is difficult to brake.
Deflation could be particularly destructive in Europe, where governments, banks and private households are still struggling with excess debt. When companies and individuals earn less, they have trouble repaying their debts, which remain the same.
There was still no sign from Mr. Draghi that the E.C.B. is considering the huge purchases of government bonds that the Fed and the Bank of England have used to stimulate growth after interest rates were already close to zero.
Although the euro zone emerged from recession earlier this year, recent economic indicators have sent conflicting signals about the strength of the recovery. Few economists expect a strong rebound, but some have been more pessimistic than others, warning of long-term stagnation if the E.C.B. does not do more to stimulate lending and growth.
"Will the rate cut help? I don't think so," Carl Weinberg, chief economist of High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y., said in an email. "Euroland's economy is being strangled by a credit crunch. The real story is that the depression in Euroland is putting severe disinflationary pressure on prices. The forecast is for the downward pressure to get worse before it gets better."

Full text:   Five years after the global economy was falling at its fastest rate, Western economies are still failing to gain much-needed momentum, despite the efforts of central bankers on both sides of the Atlantic.
The challenges facing the United States and Europe were evident on Thursday, with the latest figures on growth from Washington showing signs of underlying weakness as the European Central Bank unexpectedly cut interest rates to a record low, reflecting the threat of deflation.
At first glance, the 2.8 percent annualized growth rate estimated for the United States for the third quarter might appear somewhat rosy. It was the fastest quarterly increase in output so far this year, and well above the 2 percent change economists had expected. But nearly a full point of that jump was caused by a buildup in inventory, which is likely to sap expansion in the current quarter. The annual rate of growth in consumer spending slowed sharply to 1.5 percent, the weakest quarterly increase in more than two years, while spending by the federal government fell 1.7 percent.
Last month's government shutdown did not take place until after the period surveyed in the report, but the decline in federal spending in July, August and September showed how the across-the-board budget cuts imposed by Congress this year were beginning to bite. Over the last four quarters, federal spending cuts have shaved annual growth by half a percent, according to Dean Maki, chief United States economist at Barclays.
"Clearly, there was an upside surprise in the headline figure, but it doesn't change our thinking about growth," Mr. Maki said. "One common theme between the U.S. and Europe is that government spending has been a drag on growth."
While the United States and Europe share many problems, it is clear that the situation on much of the Continent is much worse.
Many economies in Europe are only now stabilizing after six quarters of renewed recession, and unemployment across the 17 nations that share the euro currency stands at around 12 percent. In especially hard-hit countries like Greece and Spain, the unemployment rate is more than twice that.
The latest data on unemployment in the United States is due out on Friday, but in September the jobless rate stood at 7.2 percent. On Thursday, the Labor Department reported that new jobless claims in the week ending Nov. 2 dropped by 9,000 to 336,000.
Earlier this week, the consistently overly optimistic European Commission cut its growth forecast for 2014 to 1.1 percent from 1.2 percent, and Thursday's move by Europe's central bank signaled that central bankers in Frankfurt belatedly recognized just how grim things were.
"The U.S. numbers are not great, but they are consistent with a recovery," said Adam S. Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. "In Europe, there is stagnation."
The central bank's move on Thursday was prompted by a sudden drop in euro zone inflation to an annual rate of 0.7 percent in October, well below the bank's official target of about 2 percent. The decline raised the specter of deflation, a sustained fall in prices that can destroy the confidence of consumers and the profits of companies, along with the jobs they provide.
While austerity has taken root in both Washington and many European capitals, crimping fiscal policy, the courses charted by central bankers in terms of monetary policy have diverged. Thursday's rate cut in Europe was a step in the right direction, Mr. Posen said, but he suggested that the central bankers in Frankfurt should follow the lead of the Federal Reserve and go much further.
Unlike the European bank, the Fed has moved aggressively to stimulate the American economy, not only cutting short-term interest rates to near zero but embarking on three rounds of asset purchases aimed at lowering borrowing rates and lifting the growth rate.
Most economists on Wall Street were confident the Fed would begin reducing its $85 billion a month in purchases of Treasury securities and mortgage-backed bonds in September. The Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, hinted in the late spring that this so-called tapering process was around the corner.
But since then, anemic employment gains, and mixed signals for the economy over all, have stayed the Fed's hand. Many economists now expect the Fed to keep its current policies in place until the spring. And there are signs that it may seek to counter any negative effects from trimming its asset purchases by vowing to keep interest rates ultralow even longer.
Most economists now credit the Fed with heading off the deep doldrums bedeviling Europe, while at least partly compensating for cuts in federal spending imposed by Congress and weakness in the private sector.
"The Fed opened up the floodgates and prevented even weaker growth or another recession," said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS. "In Europe, you have fiscal tightening without anything like what we did in terms of monetary policy."
The Fed's policies have helped bolster the housing industry -- one of the most notable bright spots in Thursday's report on growth. Residential housing investment rose 14.6 percent in the third quarter, a slight pickup from the robust gains in the first half of the year.
Many experts have worried that housing and home building might cool because of the increase in interest rates in the late spring and summer that is making mortgages more costly. But five years after leading the economy down, housing is helping keep it afloat. Another source of strength was the trade balance, as exports grew more quickly than imports.
Thursday's report is the government's first estimate for the change in gross domestic product in the third quarter, and the two subsequent estimates are likely to be revised considerably as more data becomes available.
Looking ahead, the picture for growth remains cloudy both in the United States and overseas.
Although the euro zone has technically emerged from recession, recent economic indicators have sent conflicting signals about the strength of the recovery. Few economists expect a strong rebound, but some are more pessimistic than others.
As for the United States, economists on Wall Street estimate that the shutdown will ultimately reduce fourth-quarter growth as much as half a percentage point. And momentum was slowing even before the shutdown, with businesses becoming increasingly cautious over the summer. Expenditures on equipment fell 3.7 percent in the third quarter, reversing a 3.3 percent gain in the second quarter.
"The economy remains stuck in the mud," Ethan Harris of Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in a note to clients on Thursday. "Uncertainty over the future will cause business to delay making decisions."

Full text:   BRUSSELS -- A fragile recovery across the European Union is not expected to bear fruit until next year. And unemployment is likely to remain high in countries like Greece and Spain, and even rise in France, the Union's head of economic policy warned Tuesday.
Left-leaning lawmakers in the European Parliament immediately branded the autumn economic forecast by Olli Rehn, the European Union's commissioner for economics and monetary affairs, as evidence that the bloc's austerity policies were continuing to inflict unnecessary pain on millions of Europeans.
And some analysts warned that the forecasts might even be too optimistic in parts, saying that investors and business were likely to remain jittery about growth in many countries and that Europe could even face a sustained period of deflation -- an affliction in which economic demand is so weak that prices actually decline, potentially making government debt reduction all the harder.
The report could increase pressure on the European Central Bank to take action to stimulate the economy when it meets on Thursday. Last week, official figures showed inflation falling to an annual rate of just 0.7 percent, well below the E.C.B.'s official target of about 2 percent.
Mr. Rehn's forecasts could bolster those members of the E.C.B.'s Governing Council who argue that action is needed to prevent the euro zone from becoming stuck in the same kind of economic stagnation that afflicted Japan for decades.
At a news conference Tuesday, Mr. Rehn said the risk of deflation was remote, but he declined to comment on whether the E.C.B. should lower interest rates.
Mr. Rehn said economic output for all of 2013 among the 17 countries that use the euro currency was expected shrink by 0.4 percent, but would grow by 1.1 percent next year. He also said that the 28 countries of the European Union would have an average of zero growth this year, but were expected to grow by 1.4 percent in 2014.
The forecasts also show rising joblessness in France now estimated at 11 percent and projected to rise next year to 11.2 percent.
That could further erode faith among European leaders in the ability of President François Hollande of France to steer the second-largest economy in the euro zone to a robust recovery.
"The forecasts are particularly damning for France and will significantly increase pressure on Hollande at a time the president is already vulnerable," said Mujtaba Rahman, the director for Europe of the Eurasia Group. That "will reinforce a growing strand of opinion in Berlin that France is the weakest link, and that political ownership of structural reforms is the missing piece of the puzzle when it comes to broader euro zone stabilization," Mr. Rahman said.
Mr. Rehn's forecast revised French growth down to 0.9 percent in 2014 from a forecast of 1.1 percent made back in the spring, while growth in Spain for 2014 was revised down to 0.5 percent from an earlier 0.9 percent projection.
Both countries are also on course to narrowly miss important interim deficit targets previously agreed to with the European Union, according to the outlook.
Jabbing back at Mr. Rehn from Paris, the French finance minister, Pierre Moscovici, said that Brussels officials were wrongly assuming that French policy would remain unchanged and failing to take into account the government's plans to cut spending.
But with the French public wearying of the seemingly never-ending lineup of new taxes since Mr. Hollande took office last year, and with municipal elections looming in 2014, it is not clear how much latitude the government has to address the budget deficit.
Even so, Mr. Rehn said he was "counting on these countries to undertake serious and effective economic reforms to boost competitiveness, growth and employment," having already given them both an extra two years to meet deficit targets. He was referring to France and Spain.
Marie Diron, a senior economic adviser at EY, a consultancy, said the outlook for the euro area was broadly in line with those by her own company. But she was "less optimistic about the strength of the recovery" that Mr. Rehn projected for the euro zone of 1.1 percent next year and 1.7 percent in 2015. "Weaker growth," she warned, "would mean that the risk of deflation is more significant than implied" by the forecast.
Mr. Rehn acknowledged that "unemployment remains at unacceptably high levels" in Europe and was unlikely to improve quickly.
According to the forecast, unemployment in the euro zone will rise to 12.2 percent for 2013 and remain at that level through next year, compared with a rate of 11.4 percent in 2012.
"This forecast once again confirms that doing nothing does nothing for the European economy," Hannes Swoboda, who leads the powerful Socialist bloc in the European Parliament, said in a statement. "An illusory 'turnaround' has been announced -- always just around the corner -- for years now, but never materializes," said Mr. Swoboda, a lawmaker from Austria.
In Italy, unemployment was expected to reach 12.2 percent this year, then rise again to 12.4 percent in 2014 and ease only slightly, to 12.1 percent, in 2015.
Mr. Rehn offers his forecasts three times a year, and critics have come to see them as exercises in justifying the kind of austerity medicine he has prescribed since the accumulation of enormous debt in countries like Greece, Portugal and Ireland threatened the existence of the euro. The debt load has crippled other economies in the bloc and contributed to problems like chronic joblessness.
On Tuesday, Mr. Rehn said that years of painful reforms and budgetary rigor made it more likely that domestic demand would gradually become the main engine for growth in Europe. "The fiscal consolidation and structural reforms undertaken in Europe have created the basis for recovery" and "we must continue working to modernize the European economy," he said.
Mr. Rehn has also recently gained powers to monitor national budgets and assess the performance of individual European economies. He will use the forecasts he made on Tuesday to make assessments on Nov. 15 of whether countries like France and Italy will need to make more efforts at reform and fiscal tightening, and whether Germany should do more to ease a trade surplus that international economic officials and the United States have criticized as too high.
Closer term on the policy front, a growing number of economists are forecasting E.C.B. action on Thursday, either in the form of a cut in official interest rates or stepped-up lending to euro zone banks -- or both.
Other E.C.B. watchers, though, expect the central bank to hold off until December, after its in-house economists have updated their own forecasts.
With the E.C.B.'s benchmark interest rate already at a record low of 0.5 percent, "another cut now would leave precious little room to maneuver," Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y., wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday.
Mr. Rahman, the Eurasia Group director, said Mr. Rehn's forecasts "will be used by both E.C.B. doves and hawks alike." But because "the numbers are far from conclusive, they are likely to reinforce as opposed to unlock E.C.B. gridlock," he said.
European corporations remain cautious about the prospects for recovery.
"If we have growth in Europe it will be at a very low level," Norbert Reithofer, chief executive of the German automaker BMW, said during a conference call with reporters on Tuesday. He said he expected growth to pick up during the second half of next year.

Full text:   SAC Capital first sought to fend off a federal indictment. Then the hedge fund, run by the billionaire Steven A. Cohen, offered to pay about $700 million to settle. Finally, SAC suggested it plead guilty to only some of the criminal charges in the five-count indictment.
But at every turn, the government refused.
And so on Monday, SAC agreed to plead guilty to all five counts of insider trading violations and pay a record $1.2 billion penalty, becoming the first large Wall Street firm in a generation to confess to criminal conduct. The deal caps a decade-long investigation that has turned a mighty hedge fund into a symbol of financial wrongdoing.
An account of the negotiations, based on interviews with people briefed on the case, illuminates the private wrangling and underscores just how aggressive the government was in extracting the deal.
The guilty plea and fine paid by SAC are part of a broader plea deal that will impose a five-year probation on the fund and require it to hire an outside monitor. SAC must also terminate its business of managing money for outside investors, a largely symbolic blow, as it already faces an exodus of client money.
It will still most likely continue to manage Mr. Cohen's vast fortune, a move that would help maintain its influence on Wall Street.
The case could inspire other aggressive actions against Wall Street, as the Justice Department's uneven crackdown on financial fraud has gained momentum. Coming just days before JPMorgan Chase is expected to complete a $13 billion settlement with the government over the bank's questionable mortgage practices, the SAC plea might stem long-seeded concerns that the Obama administration has been reluctant to bring charges against major financial firms.
"No institution should rest easy in the belief that it is too big to jail," Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, said on Monday.
The $1.2 billion penalty adds to the $616 million in insider trading fines that SAC already agreed to pay to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Mr. Cohen, who owns 100 percent of the firm, will pay those penalties himself.
SAC's total $1.8 billion punishment sets a record for insider trading cases and far surpasses those of other recent noteworthy financial prosecutions. Raj Rajaratnam, the fallen hedge fund titan serving an 11-year prison sentence for insider trading, was ordered to pay about $157 million.
In a letter to the court, Mr. Bharara called the SAC penalty, which was slightly above federal guidelines, "steep but fair" and "commensurate with the breadth and duration of the charged criminal conduct," a reference to the eight former SAC traders charged with securities fraud. Six of those traders have pleaded guilty and are cooperating with prosecutors.
SAC, which is based in Stamford, Conn., said in a statement that it took "responsibility for the handful of men who pleaded guilty and whose conduct gave rise to SAC's liability. Even one person crossing the line into illegal behavior is too many and we greatly regret this conduct occurred."
SAC's guilty plea serves as a capstone moment in the government's vast insider trading crackdown, which has produced more than 70 convictions, including that of Mr. Rajaratnam.
Led by federal authorities in Manhattan, the inquiry began in the middle of the last decade using techniques normally reserved for organized crime cases. F.B.I. agents used wiretaps to record Wall Street traders and pressured low-level employees to cooperate against their colleagues and bosses.
The SAC case began 11 years ago with a simple suspicion: Its investment returns were too good to be true. The fund has posted average annual returns of nearly 30 percent.
With questions mounting, a small team of investigators at the S.E.C. contacted the nation's stock exchanges to ferret out whether insider trading was at play, officials briefed on the case said. The inquiry ebbed and flowed for years, producing leads but no smoking gun.
But in 2006, the F.B.I. had a breakthrough. It secured the cooperation of David Slaine, an employee of Mr. Rajaratnam's hedge fund, the Galleon Group. Mr. Slaine soon offered the government a lens inside not only Galleon but the inner workings of competitors like SAC.
Starting in 2009, after the S.E.C. intensified its focus on SAC, the government gained further momentum when it secured a series of guilty pleas that appeared to legitimize the speculation swirling around the hedge fund. Noah Freeman, who joined SAC in 2008, told investigators that he thought insider trading was part of his job description.
"What started with a key cooperator, led to thousands of hours of relentless investigative work by a team of F.B.I. agents, uncovering an extensive network trafficking in inside information throughout the hedge fund industry," April Brooks, the F.B.I. special agent in charge, said at a news conference on Monday.
The trading by two other former SAC portfolio managers, Mathew Martoma and Michael S. Steinberg, is also central to the indictment.
Prosecutors have accused Mr. Martoma, who has pleaded not guilty, of using confidential drug trial information to trade the stocks of pharmaceutical firms.
Mr. Steinberg stands accused of trading on inside information about the computer maker Dell. He has maintained his innocence and will stand trial on Nov. 18.
From this batch of cases, the government readied charges against SAC. But an indictment was not a forgone conclusion.
SAC and the government, the people briefed on the matter said, discussed a plea deal that included a guilty plea and a fine but would have spared it the embarrassment of an indictment.
Ultimately, talks broke down, paving the way for the government to bring the indictment in July, charging SAC with four counts of securities fraud and one count of wire fraud.
SAC pleaded not guilty. But in the weeks that followed, the fund had little to do but settle. The law of corporate criminal liability, which allows the government to attribute the criminal acts of employees to the company itself, buttresses the case. With former SAC employees having pleaded guilty -- and the employees likely to have testified at a trial -- SAC's defenses were few.
And yet SAC, led by lawyers at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison and Willkie Farr & Gallagher, still pushed back when it came to money.
The United States attorney's office, according to the people briefed on the case, demanded $1.8 billion in penalties from SAC -- $900 million in fines and $900 million in forfeited profits. The office and its criminal division chief who handled negotiations, Lorin L. Reisner, was willing to deduct from that amount the $616 million the fund already paid to the S.E.C., reducing the additional penalty to about $1.2 billion.
After prosecutors rejected SAC's initial offer of roughly $700 million, the fund raised the amount to about $1 billion. When that failed, SAC acceded to the $1.2 billion deal.
Even with the deal, criminal authorities continue to view Mr. Cohen and other SAC employees as targets of a continuing insider trading investigation. The plea agreement expressly states that it "provides no immunity from prosecution for any individual."
What's more, the plea deal does not incorporate a separate civil action the S.E.C. brought against Mr. Cohen. The S.E.C., which accused him of turning a blind eye to misconduct at his fund, is seeking to bar Mr. Cohen from managing outside money, at SAC or elsewhere.
Many have drawn comparisons between Mr. Cohen and Michael R. Milken, the junk bond pioneer at Drexel Burnham Lambert who became synonymous with financial greed during the go-go 1980s. After pleading guilty to securities fraud charges, Mr. Milken paid about $1 billion in penalties, adjusted for inflation. A quarter-century ago, Drexel pleaded guilty to securities fraud, the last big Wall Street firm to enter a guilty plea.
Guilty pleas by financial institutions are exceedingly rare, and legal specialists say the case against SAC could embolden prosecutors to bring criminal charges against other firms.
Brandon L. Garrett, a professor at the University of Virginia School of Law and author of the forthcoming book, "Too Big to Jail: How Prosecutors Target Corporations," said that while environmental and antitrust inquiries frequently resulted in corporate indictments, financial fraud investigators were just now "starting to see the light."
"Prosecutors have increasingly been saying that no company is too big to jail, and now they can point to the SAC case and say 'We really mean it,' " Mr. Garrett said.

Full text:   DENVER -- In one poor school district in Colorado's San Luis Valley, students take classes in a bus garage, using plastic sheeting to keep the diesel fumes at bay. In another, there is no more money to tutor young immigrants struggling to read. And just south of Denver, a district where one in four kindergartners is homeless has cut 10 staff positions and is bracing for another cull.
For decades, schools like these have struggled to keep pace with their bigger and wealthier neighbors. On Tuesday, Colorado will try to address those problems with one of the most ambitious and sweeping education overhauls in the country, asking voters to approve a $1 billion tax increase in exchange for more school funding and an educator's wish-list of measures.
The effort has touched off a fevered debate in a state that two decades ago passed one of the nation's strictest limits on taxes and spending. It is emerging as the latest test of whether Democrats can persuade voters to embrace higher taxes by tying them to school funding.
Outside money is pouring into the state. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York, who spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to support gun control here, has given $1 million to the school campaign, as have Bill and Melinda Gates, whose foundation is one of the largest philanthropic organizations involved in public education. Teachers' unions have contributed at least $4 million, and other pro-labor groups have given thousands.
The referendum will ask voters to replace the current flat state income tax rate of 4.6 percent with a two-tier system. Residents with taxable incomes below $75,000 would pay 5 percent; taxable incomes above $75,000 would be taxed at 5.9 percent. "Big Change. Small Price," declare commercials supporting the measure, known as Amendment 66.
The amendment would also require the state to direct 43 percent of its budget to schools, ending the current system of tying increases to the rate of inflation.
Supporters say the measure would provide enough money to revolutionize education for a generation. Opponents, which include anti-tax groups and Republican politicians, say it would raise taxes on struggling families and businesses with no guarantee of a better education.
"It's a very hard sell," conceded Gov. John W. Hickenlooper, a Democrat and the measure's highest-profile advocate.
In 2010, Colorado spent about $9,306 per student, among the bottom 10 states in the country, according to data compiled by Education Week. Over all, the publication ranked the state's education system slightly behind the national average.
Amendment 66 would make full-day kindergarten standard across the state. It would set aside more money for students who do not speak English, have learning disabilities or come from poor families. It would send more money toward charter schools, as well as districts in poorer areas that cannot easily raise property taxes to buy computers or raise teacher salaries. The measure would also let people go online to track how schools spend every dollar.
"Total transparency, school by school," Mr. Hickenlooper said. "No state's ever done that."
The prospect of more money for all has united two usually warring factions, teachers' unions and the charter school movement. But most business groups have either stayed on the sidelines or expressed worry about the effects of a tax increase on small businesses and job creation. Most Republicans have lined up in opposition, eager to beat back a big tax increase and deal Mr. Hickenlooper, who is up for re-election next year, an embarrassing political defeat.
The opposition is being vastly outspent. The main group opposing the measure, Coloradans for Real Education Reform, has raised $24,400, according to state campaign finance figures. Much of that comes from the Independence Institute, a libertarian research group based in Denver.
Some opponents in richer school districts also object to new funding formulas that would pump more money into poorer schools and those with more students at risk of dropping out. They say the measure's attempt to even out imbalances between wealthy and struggling schools would just create new disparities.
"It's a bad deal," said Doug Benevento, a school board member in conservative Douglas County and the father of a third-grader and a kindergartner. "One hundred million dollars would leave our county. Roughly $50 million of that would return."
In California last year, the Democratic governor, Jerry Brown, won passage of a referendum temporarily raising taxes for the first time since 2004 by framing the $6 billion tax increase as a way to save California's underfinanced public schools. But here, the effort might hinge on which Colorado shows up to vote on Tuesday. Will it be the Colorado that legalized marijuana, embraced expanded background checks for gun sales and twice supported Barack Obama for president? Or the Colorado that, in September, ousted two state senators for embracing new gun control laws?
"It's winnable, but it's going to be tight," said Mike Johnston, a Democratic state senator from northeast Denver and an architect of the education measure. "There are a lot of question marks on this one."
Among them are new election rules that allow voters to register as late as Election Day.
As the election approaches, supporters have begun a $10 million push to mobilize voters who might otherwise tune out during an off-year campaign.
The two sides are debating each other on radio stations and at community centers. Volunteers are knocking on doors and handing out leaflets. The state's newspapers have taken sides. The airwaves are filled with commercials offering promises that an average tax increase of $133 per household would fund more teachers' assistants, art and gym classes and expanded early childhood education, which have been gutted by budget cuts since the recession.
Opponents said they were worried that school districts could use the money not to pay teachers or decrease class sizes but to meet their soaring pension costs.
But George Welsh, the superintendent of Center School District in southern Colorado, says the money could forestall more hard choices. Cuts have whittled budgets bare, he said, forcing the district to pare vocational programs in the high school and raise fourth- and fifth-grade class sizes to 30 students. Elementary art is long gone, and after a federal grant was exhausted, the district can no longer offer reading tutoring to all of the students who need it.
If the funding measure passes, the district stands to receive an additional $2,413 for each student, an increase of 32 percent over the current level of $7,523. If it fails, Mr. Welsh said, the district may have to cut more.
"We just don't have the money," he said.

Full text:   Perhaps there's more we could do to antagonize American allies.
The National Security Agency could tweet Chancellor Angela Merkel's juicy phone conversations, or post video clips on YouTube of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan singing in the shower.
The Pentagon could fly drones over Paris, dropping Big Macs on fine restaurants, just to show that we can.
Government officials fume at Edward Snowden and Chelsea Manning for harm they did to American security. Fair enough. But the latest uproar over our N.S.A. spying is a reminder of how senior American officials have themselves jeopardized our strategic interests -- by overreaching and doing things just because they could.
Our national security policy has gone off the rails since 9/11. For a dozen years, security has been an obsession, rarely constrained by a weighing of trade-offs, and to what result? We have sought every tactical advantage, and this sometimes leads -- as in eavesdropping of foreign allies -- to strategic losses.
We have doubled spending on intelligence, after inflation, to more than $70 billion annually. More people have "top secret" clearances than live in the District of Columbia -- and it was inevitable that there would be some rogues among them. When everything is classified, the system loses credibility, transparency and accountability.
The war on terror led us to fight wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, achieving few obvious gains but costing thousands of American lives. For every jihadi we killed, we appear to have created several new ones.
As a Chinese saying goes, we lifted up a rock and dropped it on our own feet.
When he took office, President Obama seemed likely to reorient security policy. He did, indeed, bring troops back from Iraq and, after a misconceived "surge" in Afghanistan, is winding down our presence there.
But, over all, his security policy is surprisingly similar to President Bush's: Guantánamo remains an affront to our values and the world's, N.S.A. spying programs continue in force, drone strikes have been stepped up, and the White House has tried to curb serious public conversation about drones, spying and cyberwarfare. The Obama administration has prosecuted more whistle-blowers under the Espionage Act than all previous administrations put together.
The latest scandal involving our spying on European leaders is symptomatic of this larger myopia about our strategic interests.
It's true that some of the outrage in Europe is affected. As Bernard Kouchner, the former foreign minister of France, bluntly noted in a radio interview: "Let's be honest. We eavesdrop, too. Everyone is listening to everyone else. But we don't have the same means as the United States, which makes us jealous."
Still, our eavesdropping seems to have broken German law, as well as the first rule of spying: Don't get caught.
If President Obama really didn't know that 35 world leaders were being listened to, something was wrong with intelligence oversight. A former C.I.A. senior official says that before 9/11, that kind of monitoring of world leaders was always cleared by the White House.
"Anything with senior government officials or heads of state was checked quite carefully, at least with the national security adviser, if not the president," the official told me.
Yet, since 9/11, our security policy has been on autopilot: If we can spy on Merkel, let's do it! If we can use a drone to kill a suspected terrorist, go for it! If we can keep people indefinitely in Guantánamo, why not?
Our hubris has undercut America's greatest foreign policy advantage: our soft power. In Pakistan, for example, our drone strikes have removed some dangerous militants. But drone strikes deeply antagonized the Pakistani people, tarnishing our image and reducing our leverage in a pivotal country. Our drones damaged our own influence in Pakistan more than the Taliban's.
As David Rohde of Reuters puts it: "The United States obsession with Al Qaeda is doing more damage to the nation than the terrorist group itself."
Richard Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations, notes that the majority of Europeans today have no memory of the Cold War and that, as a result, we have less leeway today to antagonize our allies. "This is a different geopolitical era," he said. "We can't assume that people are for us."
Yes, there is still a place for drones, for spying on allies, for the N.S.A. But they need to be subjected to scrutiny, context and brakes, as they were before 9/11.
Commercial aviation would be safer if we were all required to fly stark naked. But we accept trade-offs -- such as clothing -- and thus some small risk. In the same way, it's time to pause for a breath in the security realm and start examining the trade-offs, rather than just doing things because we can.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve is still waiting for clear evidence that the economy can grow decently without its help.
The Fed's widely expected announcement on Wednesday that it would press ahead with its stimulus campaign of asset purchases and low interest rates reflected the reality that the nation's central bankers gained little clarity in the six weeks since their last meeting, in part because the government shutdown delayed and distorted key economic indicators.
The statement, issued after a scheduled two-day meeting of its policy-making committee, amounted to a declaration that the Fed is not yet ready to decide, and it shed little light on how soon changes may come.
The Fed maintained its optimistic assessment of "growing underlying strength in the broader economy," contrasting the recovery of the private sector with the continued drag of federal spending cuts. It said that the availability of jobs was improving and that it expected inflation to rebound from its sluggish pace. Notably, it made no direct mention of the shutdown.
But despite the relatively sunny forecast, largely unchanged from the Fed's last meeting in September, Fed officials remain reluctant to pull back. As a result, the central bank will continue to add $85 billion a month to its portfolio of Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities.
And the Fed, if anything, has reinforced its commitment to hold short-term interest rates near zero through next year and well into 2015. "Taking into account the extent of federal fiscal retrenchment over the past year, the committee sees the improvement in economic activity and labor market conditions since it began its asset purchase program as consistent with growing underlying strength in the broader economy," the Federal Open Market Committee said. "However, the committee decided to await more evidence that progress will be sustained before adjusting the pace of its purchases."
Analysts and investors reacted to the statement as moderately increasing the chances that the Fed would begin to retreat, or taper back on its purchases, in December, when the committee holds its final scheduled meeting of the year. Stocks fell slightly. Yet most analysts said they continued to regard the Fed as more likely to wait until the spring.
"This is a somewhat hawkish statement, but we don't think it's so hawkish as to change our expectations for a first tapering in April," Michael Feroli, chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase, wrote to clients.
Fed officials spent much of the summer preparing investors for a retreat from its stimulus campaign before the end of the year.
But there is still little sign that the Fed has succeeded in increasing job growth. The share of adults with jobs remains at roughly its post-recession nadir. The unemployment rate has fallen largely because fewer people are looking for jobs.
Some analysts saw the Fed's upbeat description of the job market as evidence of its desire to retreat, even if it is not prepared to set that in motion yet.
The description "is not true, and we know it, the data has been weakening on this front," wrote Eric Green, global head of rates research at TD Securities. "One must view the emphasis here as reason to lean against the view that the Fed has gone soft."
Mr. Green added, however, that he still did not expect the Fed to begin its retreat until March, because its desire remained constrained by the weak economic reality.
Inflation has fallen well below the 2 percent annual pace the Fed has established as its goal. Prices rose in August at an annual pace of 1.2 percent, excluding food and fuel, according to the Fed's preferred measure, the Commerce Department's index of personal consumption expenditures.
The statement said persistently low inflation "could pose risks to economic performance," but reiterated the Fed's expectation that inflation will rebound to a healthier level.
The combination of persistently high unemployment and low inflation has prompted some Fed officials, and outside critics, to question whether the asset purchases are worthwhile.
"With the benefits of quantitative easing essentially at zero, this equivocating action by the Fed is less about the economy and more about its unwillingness to begin the tapering that everyone knows must begin," Representative Kevin Brady, a Texas Republican who is chairman of the congressional Joint Economic Committee, said in a statement.
Wednesday's decision was supported by nine of the 10 voting members on the Fed's policy-making committee. Esther L. George, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, dissented as she has done at each meeting this year, repeating her concerns that the Fed's campaign risks destabilizing financial markets and unleashing inflation.
Other critics, by contrast, draw the lesson that the Fed is being too cautious. Some contend the Fed should increase the volume of its asset purchases; some want the Fed to consider more radical measures, like explicitly targeting a temporary increase in inflation.
The Fed's internal debate, however, has mostly been restricted to a narrow middle ground, pitting those arguing for more of the same against those pressing for just a little less.
After surprising Wall Street by deciding in September not to scale back their stimulus programs, Fed officials said this month that a resumption of that debate was likely to be postponed until December because the government shutdown had obscured their view of the economy. Temporary job losses during the shutdown are expected to blur the monthly unemployment reports for both October and November. The next clear snapshot of the job market will not be published until early January.
Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, said in 2010 that he had accepted a second term as Fed chairman in part to manage the Fed's exit from its stimulus campaign. But he is scheduled to step down at the end of January, making it increasingly likely that the pullback will be directed by Janet Yellen, the Fed's vice chairwoman and President Obama's nominee to succeed Mr. Bernanke.
The Senate Banking Committee is expected to hold a confirmation hearing for Ms. Yellen in mid-November. While she enjoys strong support among Democrats, Republicans could delay the process. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky has threatened to block a vote on the nomination until the Senate votes on his proposal to initiate regular audits of the Fed's monetary policy.
The Fed tightened security procedures for the release of its policy statement, which is provided to news organizations, under embargo, about 10 minutes before its public release. The embargoed access is intended to improve the accuracy of news accounts of the statement, which is closely scrutinized.
Under the new rules, which restrict communication during that 10-minute period, reporters are required to surrender cellphones before entering a room at the Fed where they receive the statement, and to use the Fed's Internet connection, which is shut off until the moment the statement is published.
The Fed changed the rules after investors complained about a spike in trading activity in the milliseconds before the Fed publicly released its September policy statement, which suggested that the information had leaked out early.

Full text:   BEIRUT, Lebanon -- The Syrian government on Tuesday fired a deputy prime minister who has lately been its most outspoken voice in favor of reform and who recently held meetings with American and Russian officials about peace talks that world leaders are trying to arrange to end Syria's civil war.
The official, Qadri Jamil, was dismissed for spending too much time outside Syria, neglecting his duties and holding meetings "without coordinating with the government," state television said. Mr. Jamil was fired shortly after he told the Russian news media that he had met with United States officials. Meetings between Syrian and American officials have been rare since the Syrian uprising began in 2011.
A State Department spokeswoman confirmed on Tuesday that the United States ambassador to Syria, Robert S. Ford, met with Mr. Jamil on Saturday in Geneva, calling the encounter one in "a long list" of meetings with people directly or indirectly connected to the Syrian government to discuss the potential peace talks.
Mr. Jamil, a Soviet-educated economist, was one of two members of tolerated opposition parties appointed to the government last year in a move billed as broadening its base. In an interview last month in Damascus, the Syrian capital, he blamed corrupt people on both sides for prolonging the war, and he said that despite his post, he was part of the "patriotic opposition," which has not supported the armed uprising.
Behind the scenes, American and Russian officials have been meeting with Syrians inside and outside government to set up the planned talks. But there is little sign of movement, with the main exile opposition group demanding the departure of President Bashar al-Assad as a precondition and Mr. Assad saying he will not talk with those bearing arms against him.
The State Department spokeswoman, Jen Psaki, said the firing did not represent any broader message about the Syrian government's willingness to participate. But opposition activists called it a ploy that would allow Russia to present Mr. Jamil as a representative of the opposition during peace talks.
And analysts said it could be a strong warning that Mr. Assad planned to remain fully in control of any peace talks or political transition -- a message delivered as Lakhdar Brahimi, the joint United Nations-Arab League envoy on Syria, visits Damascus to try to catalyze a peace process.
Randa Slim, a Syria expert at the New America Foundation, a public policy institute in Washington, said the firing of Mr. Jamil served to remind the United States and Russia that any peace talks "must go through Assad."
"Sacking Qadri Jamil is also a sign of how strong #Assad feels today," Ms. Slim posted on Twitter. "Jamil was very much #Russia's man."
Analysts in the region and supporters and opponents of Mr. Assad alike say that with the Syrian government holding its own and the rebels divided, it appears increasingly likely that the talks, if they take place, will work toward a deal in which Mr. Assad stays on, at least for an initial transition phase.
Mr. Jamil, speaking from Moscow to the Lebanese television channel Al Mayadeen after being fired Tuesday, said that his disagreements with the government were mild and declared that the demand for Mr. Assad to step down was "crippling" the dialogue before it could start.
"The idea of Assad stepping down is out of the question," he said.
Mr. Jamil said it made little sense for the government, which has said it will attend the Geneva talks, to blame him for meeting with the talks' sponsors, adding that he was working to "end the blood bath in Syria."
But he said that while he did not want to work with the Syrian government as a full-time partisan, he would go to Geneva as part of a loyal opposition and would eventually return to Syria.
At their meeting last week, Mr. Jamil tried unsuccessfully to persuade Mr. Ford to allow him to attend the meeting as an opposition member, Reuters reported, citing a Middle Eastern official. Neither the armed opposition nor the main umbrella group for the nonviolent opposition, the National Coordination Body for Democratic Change, accept Mr. Jamil as an opposition member. And in recent weeks, he had been stripped of his economic portfolio and scapegoated by state-controlled media for Syria's inflation and food and fuel shortages.
In another move that appeared aimed at positioning the government for Geneva, Mr. Assad on Tuesday issued an amnesty lifting criminal penalties for those who deserted the army, provided they turn themselves in and rejoin the service within 30 days if they are in Syria and 60 if they are abroad.
While the government says small numbers of fighters have accepted amnesties, fighters and opposition activists said the offer was unlikely to win broad acceptance.
Ryan C. Crocker, a former United States ambassador to Syria, called the deal "a good gambit before Geneva, if it ever happens."
"It would require the opposition to admit to being criminals, which of course they won't do," he said, adding that Mr. Assad could then argue, "They had their chance and must be pursued as unrepentant enemies of the state."
Maher, a former Syrian political prisoner who is now in Lebanon and gave only his first name for fear of reprisals, said in a telephone interview that such an amnesty, if accepted, would be "a coronation of Assad's victory over the revolution."
But many Syrians are still cautiously exploring deals to ease the bloodshed.
The persistence -- and fragility -- of such attempts was underscored again on Tuesday as hundreds more civilians left the Damascus suburb of Moadhamiya, which has been blockaded for months by the government. They departed under a cease-fire brokered between rebels there and a delegation including a Roman Catholic nun and Syria's minister of social affairs.
But within hours, residents of Moadhamiya were reporting that scores of evacuees had been immediately detained at a nearby military base.

Full text:   THE minivan was a cliché almost from the moment the first Dodge Caravan rolled off Chrysler's assembly line in 1983. It was the boxy family hauler aimed at harried soccer moms, a symbol of the soul-crushing conformity that was the price Americans paid for suburban comfort.
As the vehicle enters its fourth decade, we can add some new clichés. It is the Rodney Dangerfield of the automotive world, whose 15 minutes of fame may be over but whose demise has been greatly exaggerated.
Admittedly, these are not the best of times for the minivan, whose sales have declined from a peak in 2000, when Americans bought 1.37 million of the snub-nosed parent traps, close to 8 percent of new-car sales. Then, buyers could choose from at least 21 models, according to Motorintelligence.com, which tracks the industry.
This year, industry experts expect sales to drop below 500,000, about 3.5 percent of the market. It is also a much thinner market, as four vehicles -- the Honda Odyssey, Toyota Sienna, Dodge Caravan and Chrysler Town & Country -- account for almost all sales.
It has gotten so bad that last year, when Ford introduced its sure-as-heck-looks-like-a-minivan, the Transit Connect Wagon, it was at pains to deny its lineage. "It's anything but a minivan," said David Mondragon, Ford's general manager for United States marketing. "In our mind, it's a people mover."
Still, these are not the worst of times for the minivan, which seems unlikely to suffer the fate of the classic wood-paneled station wagon or the Edsel.
"People have been writing about the 'death of the minivan' for a long time," said Jessica Caldwell, a senior analyst at Edmunds.com. "No one should expect a return to the glory days, but sales seem to have bottomed out, and it looks like it has found its niche as an enduring option in the marketplace."
Now, then, is the right time not to bury the minivan but to praise it. Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar, but a minivan has never been just a minivan. Like muscle cars and sport utility vehicles, it has also been a powerful symbol and a metaphor, of hopes and dreams, as well as compromises and disappointments. Its history is inextricably braided to major social and economic trends as well as to gender politics that have reshaped America since the 1980s.
The minivan's family tree has many roots, including the Stout Scarab, a poor-selling vehicle introduced in the early 1930s that had many minivan characteristics, and the Ford Econoline cargo van, introduced in 1961. Its most interesting antecedents are two vehicles that embodied the culture wars of the 1960s: the Volkswagen bus embraced by counterculture hippies and station wagons, which represented the conformist "Father Knows Best" mentality of postwar America. In a delicious, we-all-end-up-like-our-parents twist, some of those aging flower children would help feed the minivan boom.
The minivan was born a legend, the vehicle that saved Chrysler and helped make its chief executive at the time, Lee Iacocca, a star. The carmaker was largely being kept afloat through loan guarantees from the government when Mr. Iacocca took its helm in 1979. In 1983, it introduced the Dodge Caravan and the Plymouth Voyager. They were instant hits: Chrysler sold 209,895 minivans during the first year, turning around the company's fortunes. GM introduced its own minivans in 1985 (the Chevrolet Astro and GMC Safari), and Ford followed in 1986, with the Aerostar.
"The minivan was revolutionary in many ways because it was one of the first vehicles designed from the inside out," said Alexander Edwards, president of Strategic Vision, a San Diego market research firm that does work for the car industry. "It didn't have much under the hood, and its outward appearance was anything but stylish, but the interior space of the vehicle was designed to provide space and comfort that the main family vehicle at the time, the station wagon, didn't."
Instead of forcing the smallest children to pile into cargo space without safety restraints, the minivan provided a third row of seats. It was low to the ground and provided a sliding door so children could get in and out of it easily, even in tight parking spaces. Through the years, minivans evolved to provide ever more home-style comfort, essentially becoming living rooms on wheels. Cup holders, juice box holders, dual zone temperature controls, wireless headphones, DVD players, televisions, iPod controls, heated steering wheels, umbrella holders and vacuums were just some of the accessories added.
Mr. Edwards said the minivan's focus on the interior reflected a change in car culture. "Car buyers in the 1960s and '70s knew a lot more about cars, their inner workings, than people in the late 1980s and 1990s, so it was natural for consumers to focus more on what they knew."
The minivan's bigger-is-better, having-it-all ethos reflected the swelling prosperity enjoyed by many Americans. It is no coincidence that the minivan debuted just as the stock markets were embarking on a historic bull market, when inflation was tamed, interest rates reduced and unemployment began dropping to record lows. It was an era symbolized by McMansions and supersize meals and the growth of independent after-school sports leagues that turned parents into chauffeurs.
But the ultimate domestic vehicle was soon cast as a symbol of shackled domesticity, with the "minivan stigma" attached to soccer moms who, it was said, so closely identified with the vehicles that they surrendered their identity, their autonomy, to the demands of family and suburban life. A 1997 article in The New York Times captured this dynamic when it quoted Barbara J. Byer, a mother from suburban Detroit, on why she traded her minivan for an S.U.V. "I wanted to be a mom," she said, "yet I wanted my own identity."
"There is no denying the stigma," admitted JoAnn Heck, director of consumer and market insight for Chrysler, which still controls about half of the minivan market.
When Kristen Howerton, a professor of psychology at Vanguard University in Costa Mesa, Calif., began writing a blog about her efforts "to keep my sense of self, my passion, as I became a mother," she knew exactly what to call it: Rage Against the Minivan.
"The idea of the minivan encapsulated everything I was talking about," she said in a recent phone interview. "Cars say a lot about our values and aesthetics, and the minivan is almost the perfect metaphor for being a mom -- vanilla and there to serve a purpose."
Ms. Howerton, who has four young children, is well aware of the irony that she now drives a 2006 Toyota Sienna minivan. Despite all the cultural baggage, she says, it is "very convenient."
The minivan's identification with women added to its stigma. Even though sales figures indicated that men, perhaps influenced by their partners, accounted for about 60 percent of new minivan sales, many of them recoiled at the idea of driving a mommy-mobile. And, despite marketing efforts to recast minivans as swagger wagons and macho-mobiles, minivans seem indelibly associated with more feminine images of family and comfort.
It is no surprise that the chrome-plated titan of rugged adventure fantasies -- the S.U.V. -- rose up after the minivan. It also offered lots of interior space, though not as much as the minivan. What it lacked in comfort as it bounced down the road it made up for in a high-riding design that bespoke power and security, which appealed to men and women. It is hard to find anyone in the car business who argues that S.U.V.'s are more practical or functional vehicles for what buyers actually want their vehicles to do. But in the complex world of cultural signifiers, S.U.V.'s clicked. Through August of this year, the S.U.V./sport wagon market was about 10 times as large as the minivan's, according to Motorintelligence.com.
In terms of median age (around 50), income (about $91,000 a year) and marital status (married), buyers of minivans and S.U.V.'s have long been peas in a pod. About two-thirds of the buyers of new minivans and S.U.V.'s tend to vote Republican, said Mr. Edwards of Strategic Vision, which surveys 500,000 new car buyers each year. (By a two-to-one ratio, buyers of new hybrid vehicles are Democrats).
Within this relatively homogeneous pool, Mr. Edwards said, there are notable lifestyle differences. People who buy minivans are much more likely to say they attend church than those who purchase S.U.V.'s. They are more likely to list family gatherings, reading and volunteering as favorite pastimes, while S.U.V. buyers are more likely to enjoy camping trips, hunting, going to sporting events and home repair projects.
"Generally speaking," Mr. Edwards said, "people who buy minivans are saying family is at the center of their lives, and S.U.V. buyers are saying, 'I am more than family-oriented. I am more capable, sporty and fun.' "
Not everyone has accepted the minivan stigma. Dempsey Bowling, a 43-year-old Dodge and Chrysler salesman in American Fork, Utah, spent years modifying his turbocharged 1989 Dodge Caravan for track and street racing.
"I used to drive around, see someone at a stop light and give them the sign that I wanted to race," he said. "People at first would not take it seriously." When they revved the throttle, he knew they had accepted the challenge. "I loved the way the engine would respond. Once the light turned green, the other car would take off, but I would have to get halfway through the intersection before I got a turbo boost spike, the tires would start spinning and I'd be gone."
The adage that children express their individuality by rejecting their parents' choices may be the minivan's last, best hope. "When the millennials who grew up in S.U.V.'s start having families of their own, they probably won't want the same cars their parents had," said Ms. Caldwell of Edmunds.com. "To express their individuality, they may opt for a minivan, or even a station wagon."

Full text:   Each June the great pile of stones that is the New York State Capitol in Albany doubles as a legislative bakery, and its denizens serve up a stream of outlandish delights for their favored clients.
Their handiwork too often goes underappreciated. So I decided to shine a light on two highly skilled bakers: State Senator Jeffrey D. Klein, leader of the breakaway faction of Democrats that has aligned with the Republicans, and Senator Martin Golden, a Brooklyn Republican. Together, they crafted a lovely little strudel of a bill last summer.
The wording was studiously innocuous. It raised the cost of the security tax stamp placed on packs of cigarettes, ostensibly to discourage bootlegging and raise $6 million for enforcement. Senator Golden, a blue-eyed breeze of a pol, made his case one night in June.
He spoke darkly of a recently discovered "Palestinian cell" of cigarette bootleggers, and the need for tougher enforcement. By the way, he noted, the bill might put extra cash in the pockets of the wholesalers who stamp the packs.
That last bit of information piqued the interest of State Senator Liz Krueger, a Democrat who has a bloodhound's nose for the evasions so typical of her chamber. She raised her hand. So the stamping agents get two cents per pack now, she said, "but with this law they net five cents per pack; am I correct?"
Senator Golden allowed that she was.
Ms. Krueger nodded, although not out of sympathy. Aren't we handing these stamping agents an awful lot of money without proper debate, she asked?
Mr. Golden began to mutter of higher costs for wholesalers: Con Ed, health benefits, gasoline, rent, trucks, whatever. "That's all increased much more than the dollars that we are asking for here," he said, a touch plaintively.
This was not true, at least percentagewise. A 1996 dollar, adjusted for inflation, is worth $1.49 today. The bill backed by Mr. Golden and Mr. Klein, who intently watched this debate from his desk, would more than double the revenue of the wholesale firms.
Which brings us to the point of this legislative fairy tale.
A gentleman named Leonard Schwartz is chairman of Global Wholesale Tobacco, which stood to profit handsomely from the legislation. And he wrote many checks to further his cause. He has contributed $29,500 to the coffers of Senator Golden since 2002 and $43,000 to Mr. Klein since 1999. He gave another $4,000 to Assemblyman Steve Cymbrowitz, who sponsored his chamber's version of the same bill.
"I'm not opposed to raising the price of a pack of cigarettes," Ms. Krueger says. "But someone just decided to buy themselves a bill."
All of this is perfectly legal and standard business for the State Legislature. Mr. Klein, however, is worth watching, if only because he's such a bright, deeply transactional man.
Earlier this year he carried substantial (Honey, call the chiropractor) weight for the check-cashing business, backing legislation that would allow firms to charge working-class New Yorkers as much as 200 percent interest on short-term loans.
That industry poured $50,000 into Mr. Klein's campaign coffers in the past five years.
Mr. Klein notes through a spokesman that he has often sponsored legislation cracking down on the tobacco industry. In the case of this bill, his aides note, the public interest and that of the tobacco wholesalers just happen to coincide.
The shame of this exercise is that real solutions are easily found.
California, for instance, recently mandated investing in high-technology stamps on packs of cigarettes; the move effectively wrecked the tobacco smuggling business and resulted in a 40 percent increase in its tobacco tax. If New York State followed suit, it could reap a $500 million increase in tobacco tax collections.
"It's an absolute proven way to reduce smuggling, and greatly increase tax collections," notes Michael Seilback of the American Lung Association of the Northeast.
The technology company that has helped institute the California program consults with New York State agencies. But it seems not to have invested deeply enough in the kind of campaign contributions that grease politics here. Bills to institute a high-tech security stamp in New York have consistently died in committee.
As it happens, Mr. Klein and Mr. Golden's bill died; Senator Krueger asked questions long enough to block its passage in both houses. But victories for good government are provisional. In Albany's pay-to-play world, legislators simply turn back to donors, toss up their arms and suggest a few more checks might do the trick.
"Don't look for a rationale," Ms. Krueger advises. "Just follow the money."

Full text:   The stock market is hitting record highs.
Bank profits have reached their highest levels in years.
The market for luxury goods is rebounding.
Bloomberg News reported in August, "Sales of homes priced at more than $1 million jumped an average 37 percent in 2013's first half from a year earlier to the highest level since 2007, according to DataQuick."
A report last week in The New York Times says that developers are turning 57th Street in Manhattan into "Billionaires' Row," with apartments selling for north of $90 million each.
And there's no shortage of billionaires. Forbes's list of the world's billionaires has added more than 200 names since 2012 and is now at 1,426. The United States once again leads the list, with 442 billionaires.
It's a great time to be a rich person in America. The rich are raking it in during this recovery.
But in the shadow of their towering wealth exists a much less rosy recovery, where people are hurting and the pain grows.
This is the slowest post-recession jobs recovery since World War II. The unemployment rate is falling, but for the wrong reason: an increasing number of people may simply be giving up on finding a job. The labor force participation rate -- the percentage of people over 16 who either have a job or are actively searching for one -- fell in August to its lowest rate in 35 years.
This disconnecting is particularly acute among young people. Measure of America, a project of the Social Science Research Council, recently released a study finding that a staggering 5.8 million young people nationwide -- one in seven of those ages 16 to 24 -- are disconnected, meaning not employed or in school, "adrift at society's margins," as the group put it.
Median household income continues to fall, according to recent data from the Census Bureau. The data showed, "In 2012, real median household income was 8.3 percent lower than in 2007, the year before the most recent recession."
And according to an April Pew Research Center report, "During the first two years of the nation's economic recovery, the mean net worth of households in the upper 7 percent of the wealth distribution rose by an estimated 28 percent, while the mean net worth of households in the lower 93 percent dropped by 4 percent."
The dire statistics take on even more urgency when we consider what they mean for America's most vulnerable: our children.
According to First Focus, a bipartisan advocacy organization focusing on child and family issues: "The 1,168,354 homeless students enrolled by U.S. preschools and K-12 schools in the 2011-2012 school year is the highest number on record, and a 10 percent increase over the previous school year. The number of homeless children in public schools has increased 72 percent since the beginning of the recession."
A report last month by the Carsey Institute at the University of New Hampshire bemoaned the stagnation of the child poverty rate in this country, saying, "These new poverty estimates released on Sept. 19, 2013, suggest that child poverty plateaued in the aftermath of the Great Recession, but there is no evidence of any reduction in child poverty even as we enter the fourth year of 'recovery.' "
Nearly one in four American children live in poverty.
A report last year from the National Poverty Center estimated "that the number of households living on $2 or less in income per person per day in a given month increased from about 636,000 in 1996 to about 1.46 million households in early 2011, a percentage growth of 130 percent."
And yet, the value of aid for those families is shrinking and under threat.
A report this week by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities found, "Cash assistance benefits for the nation's poorest families with children fell again in purchasing power in 2013 and are now at least 20 percent below their 1996 levels in 37 states, after adjusting for inflation."
The number of Americans now enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is near record highs, and yet both houses of Congress have passed bills to cut funding to the program. The Senate measure would cut about $4 billion, while the House measure would cut roughly ten times as much, dropping millions of Americans from the program.
Next week, lawmakers will start trying to find a middle ground between the two versions of the farm bills that include these cuts.
There is an inherent tension -- and obscenity -- in the wildly divergent fortunes of the rich and the poor in this country, especially among our children. The growing imbalance of both wealth and opportunity cannot be sustained. Something has to give.

Despite Rising Sticker Prices, Actual College Costs Stable Over Decade, Study Says

Full text:   Every year, price increases at private colleges prompt a round of appalled responses and calls for corrective action. But even as some sticker prices approach $60,000 a year, the amount that students actually pay -- because of increased discounts, grants and tax benefits -- has barely changed over the last decade, according to a major analysis of college costs published this week.
The report, by the College Board, shows that the net cost of tuition, fees, room and board for the average student at a private, nonprofit college is about 57 percent of the sticker price, down from 68 percent in 2003-4. That works out to about $23,000 this year, a figure that, adjusted for inflation, has not varied much for 10 years. (Looking only at tuition and fees, the inflation-adjusted net price is actually lower than it was a decade ago.)
The cost of college, in real terms, did rise significantly in the 1980s and '90s, and the report is not meant to play down the fact that college is often expensive and a burden, said Sandy Baum, one of the authors.
"It's not hard to find instances of people genuinely struggling to pay the prices they're being asked to pay," said Ms. Baum, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute and a research professor at the George Washington University Graduate School of Human Development. "But I think the hand-wringing about the trend is greatly exaggerated."
That hand-wringing tends to focus on the full, published prices that -- without inflation adjustment -- have jumped more than 50 percent in the past decade. In particular, news reports cite the higher-than-average sticker prices at the most prestigious colleges, though those universities tend to give the most financial aid and the deepest discounts, too.
Colleges have tried to get the word out for years about discounting and net prices, but "it hasn't been terribly successful," said Richard Ekman, president of the Council of Independent Colleges, an alliance of more than 600 private institutions. Though consumers have access to vastly more information about costs, through federal reports and databases, and the net price calculators that colleges are now required to post on their Web sites, he said, "Much of the public has trouble trying to make sense of these numbers."
Colleges could simply lower their prices and offset them by reducing discounts, and a few have gone that route, but it goes against the prevailing consumer psychology.
"Some segment of the public is delighted to know that it costs a large number to go there, but their own son or daughter has received a scholarship," Mr. Ekman said.
But college administrators worry that they may be approaching a breaking point in their ability to keep raising prices, whether or not those prices reflect what most people really pay. And many of the less-wealthy private colleges feel threatened by the rise of inexpensive online courses and degree programs, and a decline in the college-age population.
Public colleges have seen net prices rise sharply, particularly since the last recession began, as they have raised prices to offset plummeting state aid, though this year's sticker price increases are the smallest in decades. The newest, smallest segment of the market, for-profit colleges, have also had significant increases in recent years.
For private, nonprofit colleges, the combination of higher posted prices and deeper discounts has resulted in bigger disparities in what different students pay: those with low incomes pay lower net prices than they did a decade ago, while those who earn more pay more.
Experts on college pricing say they worry about how that has affected people whose incomes are somewhat above average -- those who neither qualify for generous need-based aid, nor are affluent enough to shrug off increases.
A federal government study, cited in the College Board report, showed that for a family in the second-highest quartile of family incomes, the net cost of sending a student to a private college rose almost 8 percent from 2003-4 to 2011-12, more than the increase for people in the top quartile.
"What's happening with that upper-middle group is a real concern," said Catharine Bond Hill, president of Vassar College and an economist who has researched college costs extensively. "The net price for them is pretty challenging."

Ford Maintains Earnings Streak and Raises Profit Forecast for the Year

Full text:   DEARBORN, Mich. -- Ford Motor said on Thursday that its net income fell 22 percent in the third quarter, to $1.27 billion, as the company took charges related to revamping its European operations and its United States pension obligations.
Still, Ford, the country's No. 2 automaker behind General Motors, beat analysts' expectations by setting a record for third-quarter pretax profit of $2.6 billion, up $426 million, a performance that led Ford to raise its profit forecast for the year. It was the company's 17th consecutive profitable quarter.
The $498 million in special items included $250 million for charges related to plant closures in Europe and $145 million as part of Ford's voluntary lump-sum pension payout program for salaried retirees in the United States.
Per-share profit was 31 cents.
"We continue to expect strong results for the full year," Ford's chief executive, Alan R. Mulally, said in a conference call on Thursday. The automaker posted a combined profit for regions outside North America for the first time since the second quarter in 2011. A $159 million pretax operating profit in South America beat Wall Street's expectations, while a $126 million profit in Asia-Pacific, though a third-quarter record for the company, came in below analysts' estimates.
"It was a really, really great quarter," Bob Shanks, Ford's chief financial officer, told reporters at its Dearborn headquarters. The company's performance was "encouraging from a number of perspectives," he said, with growth in wholesale volume, revenue and market share in North America, South America, Europe and Asia-Pacific.
Ford's market share in South America, where Mr. Shanks said inflation in Venezuela and Argentina could pose a problem, grew more than a full percentage point to 9.5 percent. The automaker raised its full-year forecast for South America. It now expects to turn a profit or break even.
"The overall environment in South America remains uncertain," Mr. Shanks said.
Ford now expects to record a pretax profit and an automotive-related operating margin higher than last year's. Previously, the company said it expected its performance to be on a par with 2012.
"The progress and the direction is what's really exciting," Mr. Shanks said.
But the fiscal standoff in Washington and the deferment of a long-term decision on the federal budget until early next year sent consumer confidence downward this month, Mr. Shanks said.
"Clearly, I think they were affected to some extent," he said. "It's not great that it's a kick-the-can process. It's one of the areas we're concerned about to some extent."
Ford's revenue rose 12 percent, to $36 billion, with its strongest results in North America and the Asia-Pacific region, where the company reported a 3.7 percent market share, a third-quarter record.
Ford's sales rose 31 percent in the Asia-Pacific region for the first nine months of the year, with most of that growth coming from China, Ford's second-biggest market after the United States. David L. Schoch, group vice president and president of Ford Asia Pacific, said the automaker hoped to double its market share in China to 5 percent this year.
The company continued to lose money in Europe, with a pretax loss of $228 million for the quarter, though that was 51 percent less than a year ago, suggesting that the losses are easing there, Mr. Shanks said.
"All the leading indicators indicate that it has stabilized," he said. Ford said this quarter that it planned to introduce at least 25 new vehicles in Europe by 2017.
Over all, Ford has changed course from the days when Mr. Mulally mortgaged the automaker's assets to borrow more than $23 billion in a last-ditch effort to avoid bankruptcy, analysts said.
That turnaround was symbolically completed last month when Standard & Poor's became the last of the three major credit ratings agencies to confer investment-grade status on Ford's debt, which the agency had rated at junk-bond levels for the last eight years.
"It's hard to overstate how much they've done for cost reduction since 2009," said Dan Picciotto, a corporate ratings analyst with S.& P.
Ford is in a more stable position after working to close its gap in underfunded pensions and reduce incentives on new vehicles sold at dealerships, Mr. Picciotto said.
"But it's all been done in the context of a growing market," Mr. Picciotto said. "If there is a downturn, how does Ford operate in a different scenario?"

Addicted To the Apocalypse

Abstract: [...]you more or less have to subscribe to fantasies of fiscal apocalypse to be considered respectable. Look at Japan, a country that, like America, has its own currency and borrows in that currency, and has much higher debt relative to G.D.P. than we do. Since taking office, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has, in effect, engineered exactly the kind of loss of confidence the debt worriers fear -- that is, he has persuaded investors that deflation is over and inflation lies ahead, which reduces the attractiveness of Japanese bonds.

Full text:   Once upon a time, walking around shouting "The end is nigh" got you labeled a kook, someone not to be taken seriously. These days, however, all the best people go around warning of looming disaster. In fact, you more or less have to subscribe to fantasies of fiscal apocalypse to be considered respectable.
And I do mean fantasies. Washington has spent the past three-plus years in terror of a debt crisis that keeps not happening, and, in fact, can't happen to a country like the United States, which has its own currency and borrows in that currency. Yet the scaremongers can't bring themselves to let go.
Consider, for example, Stanley Druckenmiller, the billionaire investor, who has lately made a splash with warnings about the burden of our entitlement programs. (Gee, why hasn't anyone else thought of making that point?) He could talk about the problems we may face a decade or two down the road. But, no. He seems to feel that he must warn about the looming threat of a financial crisis worse than 2008.
Or consider the deficit-scold organization Fix the Debt, led by the omnipresent Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles. It was, I suppose, predictable that Fix the Debt would respond to the latest budget deal with a press release trying to shift the focus to its favorite subject. But the organization wasn't content with declaring that America's long-run budget issues remain unresolved, which is true. It had to warn that "continuing to delay confronting our debt is letting a fire burn that could get out of control at any moment."
As I've already suggested, there are two remarkable things about this kind of doomsaying. One is that the doomsayers haven't rethought their premises despite being wrong again and again -- perhaps because the news media continue to treat them with immense respect. The other is that as far as I can tell nobody, and I mean nobody, in the looming-apocalypse camp has tried to explain exactly how the predicted disaster would actually work.
On the Chicken Little aspect: It's actually awesome, in a way, to realize how long cries of looming disaster have filled our airwaves and op-ed pages. For example, I just reread an op-ed article by Alan Greenspan in The Wall Street Journal, warning that our budget deficit will lead to soaring inflation and interest rates. What about the reality of low inflation and low rates? That, he declares in the article, is "regrettable, because it is fostering a sense of complacency."
It's curious how readily people who normally revere the wisdom of markets declare the markets all wrong when they fail to panic the way they're supposed to. But the really striking thing at this point is the date: Mr. Greenspan's article was published in June 2010, almost three and a half years ago -- and both inflation and interest rates remain low.
So has the ex-Maestro reconsidered his views after having been so wrong for so long? Not a bit. His new (and pretty bad) book declares that "the bias toward unconstrained deficit spending is our top domestic economic problem."
Meanwhile, about that oft-prophesied, never-arriving debt crisis: In Senate testimony more than two and half years ago, Mr. Bowles warned that we were likely to face a fiscal crisis within around two years, and he urged his listeners to "just stop for a minute and think about what happens" if "our bankers in Asia" stop buying our debt. But has he, or anyone in his camp, actually tried to think through what would happen? No, not really. They just assume that it would cause soaring interest rates and economic collapse, when both theory and evidence suggest otherwise.
Don't believe me? Look at Japan, a country that, like America, has its own currency and borrows in that currency, and has much higher debt relative to G.D.P. than we do. Since taking office, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has, in effect, engineered exactly the kind of loss of confidence the debt worriers fear -- that is, he has persuaded investors that deflation is over and inflation lies ahead, which reduces the attractiveness of Japanese bonds. And the effects on the Japanese economy have been entirely positive! Interest rates are still low, because people expect the Bank of Japan (the equivalent of our Federal Reserve) to keep them low; the yen has fallen, which is a good thing, because it make Japanese exports more competitive. And Japanese economic growth has actually accelerated.
Why, then, should we fear a debt apocalypse here? Surely, you may think, someone in the debt-apocalypse community has offered a clear explanation. But nobody has.
So the next time you see some serious-looking man in a suit declaring that we're teetering on the precipice of fiscal doom, don't be afraid. He and his friends have been wrong about everything so far, and they literally have no idea what they're talking about.

Full text:   DAMASCUS, Syria -- Some five million Syrians are now refugees in their own country, many living hand-to-mouth in vacant buildings, schools, mosques, parks and the cramped homes of relatives. Others are trapped in neighborhoods isolated by military blockades, beyond the reach of aid groups. Already desperately short of food and medicine as winter closes in, they could begin to succumb in greater numbers to hunger and exposure, aid workers say.
The long civil war has forced two million Syrians outside the country's borders, but more than twice that number face mounting privations at home, and the toll keeps rising. The deepening humanitarian crisis threatens to set the country's development back decades and dwarfs any aid effort that could conceivably be carried out while the conflict continues, aid workers and analysts say.
The cost of replacing damaged homes and infrastructure alone is estimated at more than $30 billion, and the ruin mounts daily. More than half of the country's hospitals are destroyed or closed, and according to Save the Children a fifth of Syrian families go without food one week a month. Syria's economy has shrunk by half.
Even in relatively safe areas, a closer look at bustling streets reveals the displaced spilling from every corner. Thousands of people live in the gyms and hallways of a sports complex turned state-run shelter in the coastal city of Latakia. In the capital, Damascus, newcomers crowd ramshackle hotels, half-finished buildings, offices and storefronts. Long lines form outside the shrinking number of government bakeries still operating. In some of the suburbs, people have confessed to eating dogs and cats, and imams have even issued decrees saying it is religiously permissible.
Outside the Umayyad Mosque in the heart of old Damascus, Nasreen, 25, cradled her baby in her lap one recent evening. She and her siblings, husband and parents, who declined to give their family name for fear of reprisals, were cramped into a single room nearby, having fled the suburb of Daraya after their home was damaged.
With rising rent depleting their savings, and the shop they relied on for income now sealed off behind a government blockade, they accept occasional handouts from neighborhood organizations. But what weighs on them most are thoughts of the future: They said they could not imagine when or how they might return to a hometown where entire blocks have been bombed to rubble.
"We have only God," she said.
Even those still in their homes are increasingly suffering as inflation soars and food shortages grow, especially in areas blockaded by the government or rebels. Many are angry and mystified that more help has not reached them from the outside world.
"It is as if we are living on Jupiter or Mars," said Qusai Zakarya, a spokesman for an opposition council in Moadhamiya, south of Damascus, where the government has not allowed aid convoys to enter for nine months. "Everyone is looking at us from the window and we are in a separate world. Everyone left us alone, every single person on this planet."
In a news conference in Kuwait on Thursday, the Turkish foreign minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, said that Turkey, which has absorbed 600,000 Syrian refugees, would keep its border with Syria open, but he also expressed his "deep disappointment and frustration because of the absence of a proper reaction by the international community" to the humanitarian crisis.
A $1.5 billion international aid effort, carried out under dangerous and politically charged conditions by the United Nations, the Syrian Arab Red Crescent and smaller local organizations, provides stopgap food, schooling and medicine to millions of people. But it is underfinanced, covers just a fraction of the needs, fails to reach people in blockaded areas and does not begin to address the collapse of Syria's health, education and economic infrastructure and its devastating implications for the country's future, aid officials in Syria and across the region say.
"If we continue to deal with this crisis as a short-term disaster instead of a long-term effort, the region will face even more severe consequences," Neal Keny-Guyer, the chief executive of Mercy Corps, wrote recently, calling for increased American financing and a new focus on longer-term development projects, like repairing water infrastructure.
Some go further, saying that the only meaningful humanitarian action now is to end the fighting.
Omar Abdelaziz al-Hallaj, an independent Syrian adviser to aid, development and conflict resolution efforts in the region, told the Lebanese Economic Association in Beirut recently that the focus must be shifted "from saving a few lives to saving more lives by halting the violence."
The war, Mr. Hallaj and United Nations officials in Syria said, is disintegrating administrative and social structures at a pace that makes it impossible to deliver adequate aid even if financing were available, which it is not. "No donor funds have ever been known to be given in the magnitude of aid needed in Syria," Mr. Hallaj said.
To help the more than six million people displaced or severely affected by the crisis inside Syria, the United Nations has asked for $1.5 billion, far less than the $3 billion it has requested to aid the two million refugees outside the country. The discrepancy stems in part from United Nations principles of dealing with sovereign states, under which the plan is intended only to support efforts led by the Syrian government. That creates a politically awkward situation, in that much of the need is in rebel-held areas.
If the war goes on for another year, Mr. Hallaj said, Syria "will be reduced to the bottom of the development ladder, along with countries like Somalia and Yemen," a shocking fall for a country that before the war produced most of its own food and medicine, and despite worsening economic inequality had a strong social safety net and educational system by regional standards.
The Syrian government prides itself on continuing to pay salaries even in areas controlled by the opposition, and in some cities local ministry offices continue to work with United Nations agencies. But the estimated $10 billion the government used to pump annually into local spending for social services, utilities, subsidies and the like has mostly evaporated, Mr. Hallaj said.
Aid workers and analysts warn that as the war continues into its third winter -- with harvests depleted by fighting -- deaths from hunger, disease and cold could begin to exceed those from the violence, which has already killed 115,000 people. A trickle of reported malnutrition deaths of sick and vulnerable people in blockaded areas could be a harbinger of more widespread famine, aid workers say.
In Damascus recently, where most United Nations agencies work in the otherwise nearly empty Four Seasons Hotel, aid workers offered example after example of how their sizable efforts remain a drop in the bucket.
Barbara Atherly, the head of Unicef's education program in Syria, said that the agency was providing one million children with schooling, increasingly by distributing educational materials to families and communities to organize lessons themselves, since many schools have been destroyed and teachers have dispersed.
But more than three million children are directly affected by the crisis, Unicef's Syria director, Youssouf Abdel-Jelil, said, including more than two million internally displaced and another million in hard-to-reach conflict areas. That does not include more than a million children who have fled the country.
Over all, two million children have not had regular access to schooling in the past year, he said, adding that as the conflict continues, "there is a real risk of a lost generation of Syrians."
The World Food Program is feeding three million people a month, plying dangerous roads with 1,200 trucks and employing 9,000 people. But that leaves two million displaced people without food aid, and understates the need in pockets where deliveries have not reached in months.
Those areas include rebel-held suburbs of Damascus blockaded by the government and government-held parts of Aleppo.
"Their situation is dire," said Matthew Hollingworth, the food program's Syria director. Hundreds of thousands of people are living on what food they can grow and the small amounts of food they can get past checkpoints, he said, as stored food stocks dwindle "to a frighteningly low level."
Tarik Jasarevic, a spokesman for the World Health Organization, said that replacing the prescription drugs once provided by the government would cost $500 million yearly, dwarfing his agency's entire budget in Syria.
In the southern province of Dara'a, a third of health workers have fled, especially from rural areas, Mr. Abdel-Jelil of Unicef said. He described one woman who crossed the front lines to bring her children to the city for vaccines.
Most of all, he said, children are paying the price in terms of health, education and psychological trauma.
"A lot are talking adult talk, about visas, about borders, about relatives who are outside of the country," Mr. Abdel-Jelil said. "They still have dignity and resilience. But there is a limit to resilience."

Abstract: Updated, 8:05 p.m. | A federal judge has ruled that Goldman Sachs must pay the legal fees of a former computer programmer accused of stealing code from the bank, a decision that wades into a hot-button issue as more and more Wall Street employees find themselves ensnared in lawsuits and investigations. [...]of these two misguided prosecutions, Sergey Aleynikov lost his marriage, his home, his job, his life savings, his good name and, for a full year, his freedom," Kevin Marino, a lawyer for Mr. Aleynikov, said in an e-mail.

Full text:   Updated, 8:05 p.m. | A federal judge has ruled that Goldman Sachs must pay the legal fees of a former computer programmer accused of stealing code from the bank, a decision that wades into a hot-button issue as more and more Wall Street employees find themselves ensnared in lawsuits and investigations.
In an opinion issued Tuesday, Judge Kevin McNulty of Federal District Court in New Jersey said Goldman had a legal obligation to pay certain lawyer bills for its former programmer, Sergey Aleynikov, because he was an officer of the bank during the time in question.
"I hold that the term 'officer' encompasses Aleynikov's position as a vice president" of Goldman Sachs, the judge wrote.
The judge noted that during the last six years, Goldman had paid the lawyer bills for 51 of 53 employees who needed a legal defense.
Mr. Aleynikov's situation has been one of the more unusual white-collar criminal prosecutions in recent years. After Goldman reported him to the authorities, federal and state officials separately brought charges against him. Now, depending on the final outcome, the government's actions against Mr. Aleynikov could cost Goldman more than $4 million.
"As a result of these two misguided prosecutions, Sergey Aleynikov lost his marriage, his home, his job, his life savings, his good name and, for a full year, his freedom," Kevin Marino, a lawyer for Mr. Aleynikov, said in an e-mail. "That the party which provoked all that misfortune must now begin to underwrite it is good news indeed."
A spokesman for Goldman Sachs, Michael S. DuVally, declined to comment. Representatives of the United States attorney's office for the Southern District of New York and the Manhattan district attorney's office also declined to comment.
The question of who should pay the legal bills of an employee accused of wrongdoing has become an increasingly important topic at banks and among the white-collar bar.
Corporate bylaws and state statutes typically permit, and sometimes require, companies to pay legal defense fees for their directors, officers and employees. Without such rules, companies would probably find it difficult to hire and retain people. The policy is intended to protect employees from lawsuits or investigations that relate to their work.
In the postcrisis era, sprawling government investigations including mortgage fraud, insider trading, money-laundering and the global benchmark interest rate Libor have led hundreds of bank employees to retain lawyers.
This wave of white-collar prosecutions has required financial firms to make hard choices on whether to pay defense fees for their employees.
Morgan Stanley paid the legal fees of Joseph F. Skowron III, a fund manager accused of insider trading while working for the bank. But after Mr. Skowron pleaded guilty, Morgan Stanley successfully clawed back $10 million in salary and lawyer fees from its former employee.
SAC Capital Advisors, the giant hedge fund charged with insider trading, has picked up the bill for former employees fighting the government. It is financing the defense, for instance, of two former portfolio managers, Michael S. Steinberg and Mathew Martoma, who are awaiting trial. But the fund is not paying the legal bills of former employees who have pleaded guilty, like Richard S. Lee or Noah Freeman.
"Mounting a defense in any federal criminal case is extraordinarily expensive, particularly in the context of large-scale financial frauds," said Harlan Protass, a defense lawyer at Clayman & Rosenberg. "Today, that cost has only increased with the sheer volume of e-mails and other documents that have to be reviewed."
The issue of corporate indemnification has become especially pitched at Goldman, which is mired in several prominent cases.
It has paid more than $35 million in lawyer fees for a former director, Rajat K. Gupta, who was convicted in an insider trading case of leaking boardroom talks to the hedge fund magnate Raj Rajaratnam.
In the case of Mr. Gupta, as a director, he was entitled to have his legal fees paid under the bank's bylaws. Mr. Gupta has agreed to reimburse Goldman if a court denies his appeal.
The bank also made a decision to pay for the defense of Fabrice Tourre, a former Goldman vice president accused of securities fraud. A jury found Mr. Tourre liable after a three-week civil trial this summer.
But Goldman drew the line at Mr. Aleynikov, a Russian immigrant who served as a vice president in Goldman's high-frequency trading group.
Mr. Aleynikov's legal odyssey began four years ago, when federal authorities arrested him after Goldman reported his misconduct to the United States attorney in Manhattan. Mr. Aleynikov was charged with stealing secret source code for high-frequency trading software as he was leaving to join a start-up.
A jury found him guilty in 2010, and Mr. Aleynikov was sentenced to eight years in federal prison. But an appeals court reversed that conviction last year on grounds that the government misapplied the corporate espionage laws to his case.
Mr. Aleynikov was released from prison, but six months later, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., the Manhattan district attorney, filed his own case, accusing Mr. Aleynikov of state crimes. Mr. Aleynikov is fighting those charges.
After the state charged Mr. Aleynikov, his lawyers sued Goldman in federal court. They argued that Goldman was obligated to pay his bills, relying on a section of the bank's bylaws that require the firm to pay lawyer fees for employees charged in criminal or civil proceedings in connection with their role as an officer of the bank.
Goldman denied he was an officer of the bank. It described Mr. Aleynikov as "a midlevel computer programmer with no managerial responsibilities." And his position as a "vice president," the bank said, was nothing more than title inflation, a courtesy label used on Wall Street to make jobs sound more important than they actually are.
Judge McNulty disagreed with the bank. He ordered Goldman to advance Mr. Aleynikov the money that he was spending to fight the state case, an amount already exceeding $700,000.
The court also said Goldman must pay reasonable legal fees incurred by Mr. Aleynikov fighting the bank on the legal-fee issue. So far, those fees are $1.1 million, though Goldman could dispute the amount.
Judge McNulty ordered further discovery on the amount owed Mr. Aleynikov related to the federal case. Mr. Aleynikov's lawyers have put that amount at about $2.3 million.
The judge offered Goldman some grim consolation.
"Goldman may understandably find the result galling; it believes that Aleynikov has stolen its property," wrote the judge. "If there is any comfort, it may lie in the fact that Goldman has also indemnified and advanced fees in cases where the conduct was alleged to be unlawful and, in the broader sense, no less harmful to Goldman."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Abstract: According to EDF, which is working with the two Chinese companies on nuclear power stations in China, the companies will be "strategic and industrial partners" in the project and will be given the "opportunity to gain experience in the U.K. and will support their long-term objective of becoming leading developers in the U.K." But at the news conference, Henri Proglio, EDF's chief executive, played down the Chinese role, saying that EDF was in charge along with the French reactor designer Areva, and that British companies would be assigned more important roles.

Full text:   LONDON -- In a back-to-the-future bet on its energy policy, the British government announced a long-elusive $26 billion deal on Monday to build the first new nuclear power station in Britain since 1995.
But in many ways, it is a move that reaches even further back -- beyond the deregulatory and privatization policies of Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s, to an earlier time when Britain and many other Western countries did not assume that their national energy needs would be served by market forces.
In reaching its nuclear deal with EDF Group, the big French state-controlled utility, and opening the door to financing from China, the British government signaled that whether in terms of environmental concerns, consumer prices or Britain's long-term energy independence, the free market alone no longer served the national interest.
"This government is facing a looming energy crisis in this decade thanks to years of neglect and underinvestment," Edward Davey, the British secretary of energy and climate change, said at a news conference in London.
Britain has been gripped by growing worries about its future power supplies, with supply falling and prices rising. Electric utilities have been reluctant to invest in new gas-fired plants to replace dirtier coal-burning ones because of many uncertainties -- including a new energy bill winding its way through Parliament and the growth of subsidized wind and solar energy projects.
Mr. Davey said that Britain would need to replace about 60 percent of its generating capacity "in a relatively short time," as Britain closes coal-fired plants to meet its climate-change objectives of cutting greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2025.
The country will also gradually close its mostly aging collection of nuclear plants, which now produce 19 percent of Britain's power. Only one of the plants, Sizewell B, which was finished in 1995, has modern technology.
The twin reactors envisioned in Monday's announcement are to be built at Hinkley Point, in southwest England, which is currently the locale of two 1970s-era reactors. They would advance the government's goal of adding more low-carbon sources of energy, but the project will come with a huge price tag. It is the kind of long-term project, with an even longer horizon for paying for itself, that private investors alone would be unlikely to undertake. The overall costs of building the plants is estimated at £16 billion, or $26 billion, in 2012 terms.
To reduce the investment risk, Britain and EDF are bringing in two state-backed Chinese companies, the China General Nuclear Corporation and the China National Nuclear Corporation. EDF also says it is talking to other investors that may take as much as a 15 percent stake.
The Chinese companies will take a stake of 30 to 40 percent in Hinkley Point. According to EDF, which is working with the two Chinese companies on nuclear power stations in China, the companies will be "strategic and industrial partners" in the project and will be given the "opportunity to gain experience in the U.K. and will support their long-term objective of becoming leading developers in the U.K."
But at the news conference, Henri Proglio, EDF's chief executive, played down the Chinese role, saying that EDF was in charge along with the French reactor designer Areva, and that British companies would be assigned more important roles.
That EDF alone cannot finance the plant "highlights the complexities of modern nuclear power projects," said Antony Froggatt, an industry analyst at Chatham House, a research institute in London. He said that it would be "better to invest in other" alternative sources of energy like wind and solar power.
Consumers will also wait a long time to receive electricity from the new nuclear plants, which EDF says will provide power equivalent to 7 percent of British consumption and enough to power almost six million homes. If EDF makes its final investment decision in summer 2014, the first of the two Hinkley Point reactors will not begin producing power until 2023.
British consumers and taxpayers will pay much of the bill. EDF will be guaranteed a price per megawatt hour of £89.50 to £92.50 -- about $144.50 to $149.40 -- for 35 years. Those prices, to be fully indexed to inflation, would be almost double current wholesale power prices.
Analysts say the terms may wind up being generous for EDF, which says it will make a return of about 10 percent from the project.
Vincent de Rivaz, chief executive of EDF Energy, the company's British arm, said that any cost savings would be shared between investors and consumers.
The British government may have had little choice if it wanted to sign a deal at this time. Other potential suppliers like Hitachi of Japan are considered years behind EDF in their technology.
Nuclear power has attractions. Unlike renewables like solar and wind it produces steady, reliable power for decades. But the upfront costs are huge and there is no payoff for a decade or more.
It is difficult to persuade a provider to build a nuclear plant without some guarantee, particularly now, when the emergence of shale gas in the United States and the growth of renewable energy in Europe are creating uncertainty about power prices.
And while Hinkley Point will not begin providing power for 10 years, the high costs of the plant will inevitably stoke the debate about rising energy bills in Britain. Even as the deal was being struck, millions of Britons were learning of increases in energy charges, including more than three million customers of NPower, a utility that announced on Monday that it would increase electricity prices by 9.3 percent and gas prices by 11 percent.
"This is a terrible deal for billpayers," said Caroline Lucas, a member of Parliament for the Greens, who called for an investigation by the National Audit Office, a spending watchdog. "At a time when the costs of renewable energy are falling, it's reckless for the government to subsidize the nuclear industry in this way."

Full text:   THE MAP AND THE TERRITORY
Risk, Human Nature, and the Future of Forecasting
By Alan Greenspan
Illustrated. 388 pages. The Penguin Press. $36.
Alan Greenspan, the former Federal Reserve chairman, writes in his new book, "The Map and the Territory," that he has been thinking about bubbles since the financial crisis of 2008. Specifically, he has been trying to understand why he and so many other economic forecasters failed to see the housing bubble that caused the crisis.
The mistake, he writes, is that forecasters treated humans as rational decision makers -- a functional fiction that no longer seems functional. But Mr. Greenspan sees a way forward: Humans, he writes, are irrational in predictable ways. What economists like to call "the animal spirits" can be incorporated into economic models.
"I have recently come to appreciate that 'spirits' do in fact display 'consistencies' that can importantly enhance our ability to identify emerging asset price bubbles in equities, commodities and exchange rates -- and even to anticipate the economic consequences of their ultimate collapse and recovery."
This is promising stuff. It might even make an interesting book. But the subject barely holds Mr. Greenspan's attention for a single chapter.
The rest of this book is instead devoted to a discursive tour of recent economic history, punctuated by conservative policy prescriptions. He declares that he no longer finds it possible to make economic forecasts because of "governmental restrictions against competition in domestic markets."
This tour has its attractions. Mr. Greenspan, one of the nation's most astute economic observers, has a rare talent for framing economic trends. He writes, for example, that as the value of the nation's economic output has increased since the 1970s, the weight has not. He means this literally: If everything "Made in the U.S.A." in 2013 was placed on a giant scale, it would weigh about as much as everything "Made in the U.S.A." in 1977. It's hard to imagine a more vivid illustration of what it means to say that the United States has shifted toward a "knowledge economy."
Still, Mr. Greenspan has been talking about the weight of the economy for a few decades now, and much of this book feels similarly familiar.
Accounts of the financial crisis, in particular, have assumed the character of Mr. Potato Head kits. There is a box of standard explanations, and each writer picks the ones he finds most appealing. Mr. Greenspan's Potato Head is made up of predictable parts: He blames the government for encouraging subprime lending but absolves the Federal Reserve's policy of low interest rates.
He has not tried to enliven this account with any history of his involvement as Fed chairman from 1987 until 2006. He covered some of that ground in his 2007 memoir, "The Age of Turbulence," but that book, written before the financial crisis, already seems dated.
In this new book, Mr. Greenspan writes that the crisis could have been entirely prevented by stricter capital standards, which would have limited the unstable reliance of financial institutions on borrowed money. But he does not explain that under his leadership, the Fed played the lead role in creating rules that let banks set their own capital levels, with predictable results.
"The marked increase in risk taking of a decade ago could have been guarded against wholly by increased capital," he writes. "Regrettably, that did not occur, and the accompanying dangers were not fully appreciated, even in the commercial banking sector."
The most provocative part of the book is Mr. Greenspan's assertion that government spending on Social Security, Medicare and other entitlement programs is the reason that the American economy has grown more slowly in recent decades. He writes that taxation of upper-income households is reducing their ability to invest in new ideas and new machines and new buildings. Less investment yields less innovation, slower growth in productivity and less economic growth.
With an economist's precision, he calculates that this decline in investment has reduced growth since 1965 by 0.21 percentage points a year -- "a consequential difference," he writes, of about $1.1 trillion in lost output.
Americans must choose, he writes: "Do we wish a society of dependence on government or a society based on the self-reliance of individual citizens?"
This is actually an optimistic view about the stagnation of innovation and growth. Robert Gordon, an economist at Northwestern University, has won a wide audience for his view that we've simply run out of transformative ideas. Mr. Gordon and other economists also see a wide range of other problems, including an aging population, declining educational achievement and rising income inequality.
Mr. Greenspan is suggesting that the problem can be fixed by throwing money at it.
Yet it is not obvious that the American economy has been suffering from a lack of financing. While Americans saved less, the rest of the world was only too happy to shovel money into the United States. Mr. Greenspan in this same book subscribes to the view that the housing crash was caused in part by an overabundance of foreign investment in the American economy.
Furthermore, taxation cannot be the reason Americans are saving less. The New York Times reported last year that most Americans in 2010 paid a smaller share of income in taxes than households with the same inflation-adjusted incomes paid in 1980. Mr. Greenspan notes that the wealthy are paying more in taxes -- but that is only true because they are making more money. Households earning more than $200,000 saw the largest decline in taxation as a share of income.
It's also worth noting that productivity and growth have sagged most dramatically since President George W. Bush cut taxes in 2001.
Maybe another round of tax cuts would turn things around.
Or maybe we really are just running out of new ideas.

Abstract: The recession has followed familiar labor patterns, with unemployment rates among college graduates roughly half those of high school graduates, just as in every recession since the mid-1970s. In time, these young college graduates will find work and they will earn pay that is significantly higher than what they would have earned had they not gone to college. Because the more education you have, the more you earn.

Full text:   Perhaps we underestimate ourselves. Five years after the Lehman collapse triggered the deepest recession in eight decades, the middle class may be solving the vexing problems of income inequality and stalled wages on its own.
Faced with unemployment and dim job prospects, Americans made one significant change that should alter their fortunes and those of the middle class for decades: they went back to school. During the recession, there has been a sharp surge in the number of Americans who are getting a college degree.
For much of the last several decades young Americans, particularly young men, had shied away from college. As a share of the population, there were actually more male college degree holders among those ages 25 to 29 in 1976 than there were in 2006. Between 2000 and 2006, the share of all Americans ages 25 to 29 with a four-year college degree dipped by 0.7 percentage points, with men leading the decline, falling from 27.9 percent to 25.3 percent.
Americans have now reversed that decline by going to school in unprecedented numbers. In 2011, there were 3.2 million more people enrolled in higher education than there were in 2006. This 18 percent increase in enrollment was the largest such jump since the end of the Vietnam War.
In the last six years, American higher education institutions conferred nearly 3.5 million more degrees (from associates to Ph.D.'s) than they did over the six years before that. By last year, 29.8 percent of men and 37.2 percent of women ages 25 to 29 possessed four-year college degrees. This blows past previous highs.
Educational gains during the recession were not reserved for the young. By 2010, there were nearly 8 million students over the age of 25 enrolled in higher education institutions, 1.2 million more than in 2007. Degrees conferred at all levels of education for all races, ages and genders are up from six years ago.
The knock on the American work force is that when it comes to brainpower, it has fallen behind our international competitors. In a recent survey of 23 countries by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, American adults were mediocre in both math and reading. In "The Undereducated American," Anthony P. Carnevale and Stephen J. Rose assert that the United States has been underproducing college graduates since the 1980s, creating a labor force unable to match the needs of employers.
But is college still worth it today? It's not just that college graduates are riding out the meager recovery living in their parents' basements; the fear is that they will permanently underperform in the labor market. This seems unlikely. The recession has followed familiar labor patterns, with unemployment rates among college graduates roughly half those of high school graduates, just as in every recession since the mid-1970s.
In time, these young college graduates will find work and they will earn pay that is significantly higher than what they would have earned had they not gone to college.
How can we be so certain? Because the more education you have, the more you earn. In 2012, two-year-degree holders earned close to $7,000 more per year than their high-school-diploma-only counterparts. Someone with a four-year degree earned roughly $15,000 more than that same someone with an associate degree. A professional degree reaped nearly $35,000 more than a four-year college degree, according to the Department of Labor.
What this means is that the income mobility problem that drives policy makers nuts disappears for those who get a degree. Over the past few decades, those born into the middle three income quintiles were more than twice as likely to reach the top income quintile if they possessed a college degree compared with those who did not. The steepest mobility gains came from those in the second poorest quintile. Nearly two-thirds of these working-class Americans jumped to the richest quintile (37 percent) or the next richest quintile (27 percent) on the basis of earning a college degree.
But we still face serious obstacles if we want to turn this recession-led college resurgence into one of the dominant economic trends of the 21st century. First, almost 60 percent of adults over the age of 25 still do not have any degree beyond a high school diploma. For men in particular, this is a problem. When inflation is accounted for, the peak earnings year for men with a high school diploma was 1973. We're living in a fantasy if we think that 40-year trend is about to change.
Likewise, college graduation rates are still far too low. Even now, 46 percent of students enrolled in a four-year college will not have a degree after six years.
And then there are the record levels of student debt. For people under 35, student loans are the second largest source of debt behind mortgages. College tuition has increased faster than inflation every single year since 1981.
So what can we do? Anya Kamenetz, the author of "Generation Debt," has put together some excellent ideas for Third Way, the centrist policy organization where we both work. Let's start by reducing the number of college administrators per 100 students, which jumped by 40 percent between 1993 and 2007. We should demand a cease-fire to the perk wars in which colleges build ever-more-luxurious living, dining and recreational facilities. Blended learning, which uses online teaching tools together with professors and teaching assistants, could also help students master coursework at less cost.
There are 37 million Americans with some college experience, but no degree. So pegging government tuition aid to college graduation rates would entice schools to find ways of keeping students in class. And eliminating some of the offerings of rarely chosen majors could bring some market efficiencies now lacking in education.
The most commonly discussed solutions to the problem of income inequality seem unlikely to get to the heart of the problem. Yes, we could raise additional taxes on the wealthy, but we just did that. Bumping up the minimum wage would help, but how high would lawmakers allow it to go? We should look instead at what Americans are already doing to solve this problem and help them do it far more successfully and at less cost.
Jonathan Cowan is president of Third Way, a centrist policy organization, where Jim Kessler is the senior vice president for policy.

Abstract: The hedge fund SAC Capital Advisors is moving closer to a plea deal with prosecutors that would force it to wind down its business of managing money for outside investors, punctuating its decline from the envy of Wall Street to a firm caught in the government's cross hairs. The winding-down of the investment adviser business at the company, owned by the billionaire investor Steven A. Cohen, would be a symbolic move for the hedge fund, which has already returned billions of dollars to investors who fled as its legal problems escalated.

Full text:   The hedge fund SAC Capital Advisors is moving closer to a plea deal with prosecutors that would force it to wind down its business of managing money for outside investors, punctuating its decline from the envy of Wall Street to a firm caught in the government's cross hairs.
An agreement to stop operating as an investment adviser is one feature of a larger agreement SAC is negotiating as it seeks to resolve insider trading charges, according to people briefed on the case. The plea deal, these people said, would also require SAC to plead guilty to criminal misconduct and pay more than $1 billion in penalties, a record for an insider trading prosecution.
The winding-down of the investment adviser business at the company, owned by the billionaire investor Steven A. Cohen, would be a symbolic move for the hedge fund, which has already returned billions of dollars to investors who fled as its legal problems escalated. It will probably continue to operate in a different form as a so-called family office, allowing Mr. Cohen to manage his personal fortune. Under the proposed terms of the tentative deal with the government, however, he will be prohibited from managing outside money for some period of time.
The people briefed on the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, cautioned that the deal could still fall apart and an agreement was not imminent.
A spokesman for SAC declined to comment. Previously, the spokesman said that "SAC has never encouraged, promoted or tolerated insider trading." Representatives for the government also declined to comment.
As the negotiations unfolded in recent weeks, the people briefed on the matter said, the government demanded $1.8 billion in penalties from SAC. The government was asking for $900 million in fines and $900 million in forfeited profits.
SAC's lawyers were urging the government to deduct from that amount the $616 million the fund has already paid to the Securities and Exchange Commission, which previously issued civil charges against the firm's subsidiaries.
The government seems prepared to strike that compromise. If SAC agrees to the deal, one of the people said, it would pay $900 million in fines and forfeit an additional $284 million to the government, reflecting the $616 million credit.
SAC's payments, if approved, would eclipse those of earlier noteworthy Wall Street prosecutions.
Raj Rajaratnam, the hedge fund manager who was convicted of insider trading in 2011, was ordered to pay $156.6 million. Michael R. Milken, the junk bond pioneer who pleaded guilty to securities fraud charges more than two decades ago, paid about $1 billion, adjusted for inflation.
While SAC would be agreeing to a record penalty, it could have been steeper for the company. If it balked at a plea deal, the people briefed on the matter said, the government threatened to pursue a much larger fine against the fund.
And with next month's insider trading trial of Michael S. Steinberg, one of Mr. Cohen's former employees who is central to the indictment of the firm, SAC faces the prospect of an even stiffer penalty. The government, according to one of the people briefed on the matter, was contemplating doubling its demand to more than $3 billion if SAC refused to settle and Mr. Steinberg was subsequently convicted.
The tentative plea deal is emerging just months after federal prosecutors in Manhattan and the F.B.I. announced the indictment of SAC, calling the fund "a magnet for market cheaters." It was a rare criminal action against such a large corporation.
The indictment, announced in July, cited the many prosecutions of SAC's former employees as proof that the firm and its units permitted a "systematic" insider trading scheme to unfold from 1999 to 2010. Six former SAC employees have pleaded guilty to insider trading while at the fund. Two others, Mr. Steinberg and Mathew Martoma, are fighting the charges and have trials scheduled.
Preet Bharara , the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, called SAC's scheme "substantial, pervasive and on a scale without known precedent in the history of hedge funds."
SAC was left with little to do but cooperate. Under the law of corporate criminal liability, an entity like SAC would be held responsible for the acts of its employees. And the employees who have admitted insider trading charges are cooperating with prosecutors and would most likely testify at a trial, bolstering the government's case.
In the aftermath of the indictment, investors continued to flee SAC, but the fund stayed afloat as banks and other trading partners continued to do business with it. SAC managed about $15 billion at the beginning of the year, but virtually all of its outside investors have asked for their money back. After returning that money in installments over the coming months, SAC would be left managing about $9 billion of Mr. Cohen's own money.
In addition to his investments, Mr. Cohen owns one of the world's largest private art collections, and he plans to sell three prominent paintings at a Sotheby's auction next month.
The group -- two works by Andy Warhol and one by Gerhard Richter -- could raise as much as $60 million, according to Sotheby's estimates.

After Pause, Resupplying Economic Data

Abstract: [...]of the delayed data, as well as the economic fallout from the shutdown itself, most experts don't expect any Fed tapering to begin until December at the earliest and possibly not until early 2014.

Full text:   Even as Wall Street breathed a sigh of relief on Thursday that the government shutdown was over and the risk of a default on United States debt was off the table for now, attention immediately turned to a critical, if more ordinary, matter for investors and traders: when will federal number-crunchers be providing data on the economy again?
The short answer is that the first new figures will be available early next week, but the bigger picture is one of delays stretching into December. What is more, the catch-up process could also help slow any decision by the Federal Reserve to ease back on its stimulus efforts.
The most eagerly awaited number, the update from the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics on unemployment and job creation in September, will come out Tuesday, Oct. 22, two and a half weeks after it was originally supposed to be released. And the October jobs report, originally set for a Nov. 1 release, will be delayed until Friday, Nov. 8.
The Consumer Price Index for September will slip from an original release date of Oct. 16 to an Oct. 30 announcement. And the first estimate for economic growth in the third quarter, prepared by the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis, is vulnerable to a delay from the original release date, Oct. 30.
"We are talking to our sister statistical agencies and we hope to come up with a new release schedule as soon as possible," said Jeannine Aversa, a spokeswoman for the Bureau of Economic Analysis. "We hope to have more information next week."
The statistics aren't of interest just to economists and other number watchers.
Most of the time, or at least in the absence of cliffhangers like the approach to the government shutdown and debt ceiling deadline, Wall Street zigs and zags with each new reading on trends like unemployment, economic growth and inflation.
The unemployment data are being watched especially closely now because the Federal Reserve has said any decision on whether to ease back on stimulus efforts depends on continuing improvement in the labor market.
And without information from the labor statistics bureau, no one knows if that is happening. As a result of the delayed data, as well as the economic fallout from the shutdown itself, most experts don't expect any Fed tapering to begin until December at the earliest and possibly not until early 2014.
Before the government closed down on Tuesday, Oct. 1, the Labor Department had been planning to release the September jobs data that same week. The monthly unemployment report is based on two separate surveys, one of businesses, the other of households, so compiling the finished report is a time-consuming process, economists said.
Much of the work for the September report had been completed by the time of the shutdown, allowing Labor Department officials to move quickly to reschedule the release for Tuesday.
Announcements for other figures from the bureau, like the consumer inflation report for October, will slip past the original mid-November release date, while the November producer price index will probably be delayed into mid-to-late December.
The Commerce Department is hoping to come up with its own revised schedule on Friday, one official said. "Our data production is like a factory," he said. "It's not like we can hire more people to clear the logjam. But I'm sure they will be working late to get this out quickly."
The Bureau of Economic Analysis depends on data from the Census Bureau, another branch of the Commerce Department, for many of its reports. And the economic directorate of the Census Bureau alone has 1,300 to 1,400 staff members, the official explained, so rebooting systems after nearly three weeks is not so simple.
"Our vision of the economy became increasingly blurred," he said. "It's going to take a little time to get our vision to be better."
One piece of data that the government has managed to release during the shutdown, initial unemployment claims, showed a drop of 15,000, to 358,000, in the week that ended Oct. 12. Still, that is well above the 308,000 weekly average recorded in September.
But Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the accuracy of those numbers was undermined by the fallout from the shutdown as well as technical problems in California.
"The jobless claims numbers are hopelessly compromised by the distortions caused by the California systems mess and the government shutdown," he wrote in a report Thursday. "Furloughed federal government workers are not counted in the numbers but people temporarily laid off as a result of the shutdown are included. The Labor Department, however, has no way of identifying these people, so we are in the dark."
Another indicator Thursday, the October survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, was stronger than expected. The current conditions index came in at 19.8, above the 17.1 average for the third quarter.
