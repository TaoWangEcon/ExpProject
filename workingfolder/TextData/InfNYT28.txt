Abstract: MR. ABE, who faces elections in July in the upper house of the Diet, Japan's parliament, has not unveiled all the details of his policy, which comprises "three arrows": monetary easing, fiscal policy and structural reform. Forced for many years to adjust to competitive pressures from overseas, Japanese companies said in a government survey last year that they were profitable at an exchange rate of 84 yen to the dollar, a big change from 1986, when they said they needed a rate of 175 yen to the dollar.

Full text:   A GENERATION ago, Japan was a colossus on any investing map of the world.
Envious foreigners called its export-driven economy a "miracle." Its real estate and stock markets seemed to defy gravity, and its financiers were so flush with cash that they bought skyscrapers, golf courses and corporate empires far from Japan's shores.
Then the bubble burst. In 1990, Japan began more than 20 years of stagnation and deflation. Invest in Japan? For most foreigners, it was wiser to avoid it. At the end of 1989, the Topix, a k a the Tokyo Stock Price index, reached 2,881. Now it's less than half that.
It's possible, at least, that those lost decades are finally over. Japanese markets have become turbocharged again, and are beginning to move markets worldwide. This year alone, the Topix has risen more than 22 percent in dollar terms, far exceeding the gain of the Dow Jones industrial average and nearly every other major stock market. The yen has weakened sharply, trading at more than 100 to the dollar for the first time in four years. That exchange rate should make many Japanese companies more profitable and more competitive. It may also inject inflation into the Japanese economy, encouraging consumers to spend and companies to invest.
"What is happening in Japan is revolutionary," said Mohamed El-Erian, the chief executive of Pimco, one of the world's largest bond managers. "Nothing they've done since the Second World War comes close in terms of economic experimentation," he said.
It's far too soon to judge whether "Abenomics" -- the new policies of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Haruhiko Kuroda, the Bank of Japan governor -- will be successful. But they have already begun to change expectations within Japan and around the world.
Most crucially, there are signs that the policies may be breaking Japan's debilitating spiral of deflation. In April, Mr. Kuroda declared that Japan would achieve an inflation target of 2 percent within two years -- an ambitious goal that he said he would achieve by doubling the country's monetary base.
The central bank, which has already been holding short-term interest rates near zero, is making direct purchases of long-term bonds and other securities. That program of quantitative easing is enormous, Mr. El-Erian said: "It is much bigger than the Federal Reserve's in the United States, when you consider the size of the two economies."
Is the new monetary policy working? It hasn't been in place long, and no up-to-date inflation data is yet in hand. The latest government figures show that in March, Japan's consumer price index fell 0.5 percent, annualized, a deflationary reading. But Japan's bond prices imply that expectations for inflation two years from now have already jumped to well above 1.6 percent.
"It's not quantifiable yet, but the psyche of the Japanese consumer may actually be changing," said Taizo Ishida, lead manager of the Matthews Japan fund, a stock mutual fund for American investors. "Anecdotally, you can feel it," he said. "People are beginning to put money into equity mutual funds in Japan, and consumers are buying luxury goods. But we'll have to see where this ends up."
MR. ABE, who faces elections in July in the upper house of the Diet, Japan's parliament, has not unveiled all the details of his policy, which comprises "three arrows": monetary easing, fiscal policy and structural reform. Monetary easing is the only one of the three that is substantially under way. It appears to be largely responsible for the yen's weakening and could have a sharp impact.
Forced for many years to adjust to competitive pressures from overseas, Japanese companies said in a government survey last year that they were profitable at an exchange rate of 84 yen to the dollar, a big change from 1986, when they said they needed a rate of 175 yen to the dollar.
The current rate of more than 100 yen to the dollar will make many export-oriented companies much more profitable, said Eileen Dibb, a portfolio manager and Japan specialist at Pyramis Global Advisors, the institutional arm of Fidelity Investments. Her portfolios include Toyota and Fuji Heavy Industries, and both should benefit from the yen depreciation, she said. While the cheaper yen could heighten trade frictions, Mr. Abe says he would like Japan to join the negotiations for the Trans-Pacific Partnership, an Asia-Pacific free trade pact supported by the Obama administration.
Ms. Dibb is bullish on the Japanese stock market, saying it is still quite reasonably priced even after its recent run. In 1988, for example, the Topix traded at a price-to-book ratio of 6.5, compared with only 1.4 today, yet current earnings are attractive and strengthening. For the first time in years, she says, the outlook is extremely positive. "It's as though Japan has turned the lights back on," she said.
Mr. Abe has adopted a stimulative fiscal policy. It may give the economy a short-term boost, but in a speech in April, Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, warned that Japan's fiscal policy "looks increasingly unsustainable," saying its debt-to-G.D.P. ratio is now nearing an extraordinarily high 245 percent.
Japan has some factors in its favor, however, making it quite different from debt-burdened countries like Greece, said M. Campbell Gunn, portfolio manager of the T. Rowe Price Japan fund. Japan's debt is overwhelmingly financed by its own citizens, he noted; it is denominated in its own currency, and Japan runs a steady current-account surplus, all of which insulate it from bond market pressure.
Furthermore, he said, Japan can reduce debt by privatizing or more efficiently operating billions of dollars worth of state-owned assets, like the nation's ports and its postal system, which doubles as a gigantic savings bank. "Japan now is in some ways like the U.K. before Margaret Thatcher," he said. "There is much that could be done if the government wanted to do it."
Structural problems, however, are major impediments to economic growth. Japan's population has been aging and declining in size, said Roger Aliaga-Díaz, a senior economist at Vanguard. Unless Japan permits enough immigration to offset this, he said, demographic constraints are likely to trim gross domestic product by 1.3 percentage points a year. "That's a big hurdle for Japan," he said.
Shifts like raising the retirement age and removing impediments to work force participation by women could improve matters, but improvements are likely to be slow in coming, he said.
Still, Japan's markets have awakened, its economy may be reviving, and the flood of yen is certainly flowing into other markets around the world, Mr. El-Erian said. "This is an ambitious effort," he said. But, he added, "Japan's mounting debt load and difficult structural problems make this program a very high-risk and high-reward one."

Full text:   Despite several quarters of controversy over bribery allegations in Mexico, Wal-Mart Stores' profitable earnings and strong sales in recent quarters made it a Wall Street darling, and its stock price hit a record high on Wednesday.
On Thursday, though, the company's financial picture worsened as it reported quarterly results that missed analysts' expectations, citing factors like a cold spring season and late tax refunds, and the stock price began to decline. Shares fell $1.36 to close at $78.50.
"We didn't have the first-quarter performance we wanted," Michael T. Duke, the chief executive, said in a statement.
Net income rose 1.1 percent, to $3.8 billion, up 1.1 percent from the period a year earlier, while revenue rose 1 percent, to $114.2 billion; analysts expected revenue of $116.3 billion.
United States same-store sales dropped for the first time since the summer of 2011, declining by 1.4 percent, versus Wal-Mart's projection of around flat. Visits to stores also fell, by 1.8 percent in the quarter.
While consumers remained under pressure, nothing drastic had changed in their economic state in the quarter, said Charles M. Holley Jr., Wal-Mart's chief financial officer, in a call with reporters. Instead, the lower-than-expected sales in the United States were because of colder weather than last year, the payroll tax increase, tax refunds that came in later than usual and little inflation in food prices.
Internationally, the company's sales grew 2.9 percent, to $33 billion, and Wal-Mart said it increased market share in several countries despite the weak sales. Mr. Duke said that the company was "disappointed in our expense control in International"; Mr. Holley explained that Walmart International lacks many of the tools the domestic business does in terms of forecasting when employees need to be in stores or when customer traffic will spike.
On a per-share basis, earnings for the fiscal first quarter, which ended April 30, were up 4.6 percent to $1.14 a share, a penny below analysts' expectations. The company forecast lower second-quarter profit than the $1.29 a share analysts were expecting, giving a range of $1.22 to $1.27. Its shares closed down 1.7 percent.
Expenses for the quarter shot up by 44.4 percent, or $200 million, mostly because of a larger-than-expected bill for the bribery allegations in Mexico Last year, The New York Times reported that Wal-Mart de Mexico officials had paid bribes to smooth expansion in the country, and executives at the company's Bentonville, Ark., headquarters had known of the bribes and declined to take action. After learning of The Times's investigation, Wal-Mart began an inquiry into potential violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and also began a compliance review.
The company spent $73 million on expenses associated with those reviews, while it had expected to spend only $40 million to $45 million. Excluding that cost, Wal-Mart said its corporate expenses would have increased by just 14.6 percent. Mr. Holley said that Wal-Mart expects to spend $65 million to $70 million on those expenses in the second quarter.
More recently, labor and consumer groups have been pressuring Wal-Mart to take steps to ensure factory safety in Bangladesh, where it produces many of its goods and where a building collapse last month killed more than 1,000 workers.
This week, Wal-Mart announced it would not join a broad factory safety plan supported by H&M and other large retailers, but would pursue its own plan, including conducting inspections of the 279 Bangladeshi factories it uses.
It seems the working conditions in Bangladesh are not at the forefront for Walmart's shoppers. Mr. Holley said Thursday that "we really haven't had much feedback from that."

New Jobless Claims Rise, And Housing Starts Fall

Full text:   New data released Thursday on the United States economy showed some worrisome signs.
Jobless claims rose sharply last week, while housing starts tumbled in April and a gauge of underlying inflation pointed to weak demand.
The data could feed fears over the impact of a government austerity drive that began in January and could also raise pressure on the Federal Reserve to continue to buy bonds to support the economy.
The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits climbed last week at the fastest pace in six months, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits jumped by 32,000 to 360,000. That was the biggest jump since November and confounded analysts' expectations for a more modest increase.
"I think there's plenty of slack in the labor market," said Tanweer Akram, an economist with ING U.S. Investment Management in Atlanta.
Futures indexes for United States stocks turned lower after the data's publication, and so did yields on government debt. The dollar weakened against the euro and the yen.
A Labor Department analyst said no states had estimated their data, and there were no signs that furloughs for government employees had played a significant role in last week's increase in claims.
The economy has shown signs that growth slowed late in the first quarter and in April as Washington's push to trim the budget deficit weighed on consumers and businesses. The federal government raised taxes in January, and sweeping budget cuts were initiated in March.
Many analysts have noted that a reluctance by employers to lay off workers has made an outsize contribution to recent improvements in employment levels. Last month, employers added 165,000 new jobs while the unemployment rate dropped to a four-year low at 7.5 percent.
Housing has also been an economic bright spot, but a separate report showed groundbreaking for new homes fell more than expected in April. The Commerce Department said starts at building sites for homes fell 16.5 percent last month. Still, permits to build new homes increased, a reassuring indication that the housing sector could still contribute to the economic recovery.
In a third report, a sharp drop in gasoline costs led consumer prices to tumble in April by the most in over four years, while a gauge of underlying inflation was also weak.
The Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index slipped 0.4 percent, the biggest decline since December 2008 when America was suffering some of the worst days of its financial crisis. Analysts had expected a more modest 0.2 percent decline in last month's prices.
In the 12 months through April, consumer prices rose 1.1 percent. That is well below the Fed's 2 percent inflation goal. Much of April's decline in prices was because of an 8.1 percent dive in gasoline costs, the biggest since December 2008.

Full text:   Stocks fell on Thursday, with the downturn accelerating late in the day after a Federal Reserve official said the central bank could begin easing up on its monetary stimulus this summer.
The three major stock indexes earlier traded in a tight range, supported by a gain of more than 12 percent in Cisco Systems shares and as investors took in a batch of economic data that pointed to slower growth.
But the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index finished near its session low after the comments from John C. Williams, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, who also said the Fed could end its bond purchases this year, assuming the labor market continued to grow stronger. Mr. Williams is not a voter on the Fed's policy-setting panel this year.
"When a Fed governor is out there and mentions this possibility, it does spook the market a little, because I don't think anybody quite knows how the stock market is going to react" after the stimulus ends, said Timothy M. Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Group in New York.
The Fed's purchases of $85 billion a month in bonds have been a significant driver of the rally in equities that has taken indexes to highs and pushed the S.& P. 500 up nearly 16 percent this year.
Analysts also said the comments could have been viewed as a reason to take a pause after such a strong run-up in stocks.
"It turned a boring day into a bit of profit-taking," Mr. Ghriskey said.
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 42.47 points, or 0.28 percent, to 15,233.22 at the close. The S.& P. 500 fell 8.31 points, or 0.50 percent, to end at 1,650.47. The Nasdaq Composite Index slipped 6.38 points, or 0.18 percent, to finish at 3,465.24.
Earlier, the Dow reached a new intraday high, at 15,302.49.
The Nasdaq fared better than the other two major indexes as Cisco shot up 12.6 percent, to $23.89, after it posted a higher-than-expected quarterly profit and said current-quarter revenue could increase.
Economic data set a lackluster tone in markets early in the day as factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region contracted, while housing starts plummeted 16.5 percent in April. New claims for jobless benefits unexpectedly jumped last week.
However, investors had speculated that soft underlying inflation also meant the Fed had room to continue its economic stimulus.
Wal-Mart Stores fell 1.7 percent, to $78.50, and dragged on the Dow after it posted a quarterly profit that missed expectations, with sales down 1.4 percent at United States stores open at least a year.
Tesla Motors shares gained 8.7 percent, to $92.25, after the carmaker said it aimed to raise $830 million through a stock-and-debt offering that would be used to repay its Energy Department loans with interest. The stock has surged more than 50 percent since the company reported earnings last week.
The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 18/32, to 98 27/32, dropping the yield to 1.88, from 1.94 on Wednesday.

Abstract: Fund managers remember only too well how Alan Greenspan encouraged the stock bubble of the late 1990s, convincing investors that he would bail them out if the stock market dropped severely. Right up at the top, Mr. Bernanke delivered this laugher: "Of course, the Fed has always paid close attention to financial markets, for both regulatory and monetary policy purposes."

Full text:   The economics world has been having a lot of fun with hedge fund managers.
After several such managers at a recent conference denounced the aggressive money-printing policies of Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, the economic blogosphere rose up to mock them.
Many hedge fund managers have been predicting that high inflation and fleeing creditors would send interest rates skyrocketing. Stanley Druckenmiller, Paul Singer, J. Kyle Bass and David Einhorn -- all big names in the investing world -- have warned against the supposedly runaway central banker. Mr. Druckenmiller said that Mr. Bernanke was "running the most inappropriate monetary policy in history."
And they have been wrong. Those silly hedge fund managers. They don't understand macroeconomics! As Paul Krugman (and many others) have explained, the lack of demand explains why there isn't any inflation and why interest rates haven't risen despite all the money-printing.
Economists and bloggers have been competing to figure out why these supposedly smart guys are so confused. In an astute post, a Berkeley economist, Brad DeLong, explained his theory: hedge fund managers thought they could muscle the Fed into caving on its big trade, much like they got JPMorgan Chase to cave on the "London Whale" trades. But they fought the Fed, and the Fed won.
Or perhaps they are simply expressing class preferences. They are ideologues, worried about their tax bills and redistribution policies. Hedge fund managers are wealthy. Asset owners hate inflation because it destroys the value of their holdings.
Or, more subtly, maybe it's an expression of preferences in their narrow professional role. These fund managers get paid mainly to manage other people's money. It's much easier to do that when assets are more volatile and when the short-term interest rates are significantly lower than long-term rates. Fixed-income managers like Pimco used to make a decent return buying long-term Treasuries, essentially investing in risk-free assets and charging fees to do it. No longer. Mr. Bernanke has revealed many of these managers to be empty suits -- and they are lashing out.
The Druckenmillers of the world have been and will continue to be wrong about a coming debt crisis and runaway inflation. A dose of moderate inflation would help the economy right now. It would spur spending and investment, and ease debtors' plight.
But what these investors are expressing should trouble all of us: they have almost no confidence in the Federal Reserve or the economics profession. And for good reason.
It's impressive that the Fed and many economists have successfully predicted the path of interest rates and inflation in the wake of the worst financial crisis in a generation. But neither the central bank nor academicians managed to predict or prevent the crisis in the first place. The failure dwarfs the accomplishment.
The Fed's track record is out-and-out abysmal. Fund managers remember only too well how Alan Greenspan encouraged the stock bubble of the late 1990s, convincing investors that he would bail them out if the stock market dropped severely. Worse, Mr. Greenspan urged people in 2004 to buy homes by taking out adjustable rate mortgages. Then the central bank did nothing to curtail the housing bubble. (Whether the Fed kept rates too low for too long is hotly debated; in Mr. Greenspan's defense, the credit bubble kept inflating after the Fed started raising rates.)
The Fed began its lender-of-last-resort role in 2007, but did little to avoid or minimize the financial crisis. Once it hit, it did the right thing to flood the markets with money, but -- along with the Treasury and a passive Justice Department -- let banks and top executives escape penalty. And now, asset prices are going wild. Junk bonds are up. Stocks are up. Housing in Phoenix and Brooklyn is going mad.
This prebubble euphoria only undermines the Federal Reserve's fragile credibility. It reinforces the notion that it seems to know only two things: how to inflate bubbles and how to studiously not recognize them.
Flush from their victory predicting inflation and interest rates, some economists discount the worrisome market activity. Mr. Krugman, a columnist for The New York Times, recently urged Mr. Bernanke to ignore bubble talk.
And lo and behold, the Fed chairman gave a talk on the very subject last week.
The Fed needs to convince the markets that it is on high alert for excesses that could cause the next crisis. And it has to come from the chairman. Encouragingly, Mr. Bernanke said the Fed was on the lookout for unusual valuations, high leverage, new and dangerous products and excessive risk-taking.
Alas, the speech had shortcomings. Right up at the top, Mr. Bernanke delivered this laugher: "Of course, the Fed has always paid close attention to financial markets, for both regulatory and monetary policy purposes."
Of course. With notably rare exceptions, as Mr. Greenspan might put it.
Then Mr. Bernanke scared hedge fund managers out of their open-collar shirts and fleeces by reiterating long-standing Fed dogma: that bubbles cannot be identified ahead of time and that "neither the Federal Reserve nor economists in general predicted the past crisis."
Answering questions, he gave an example of what the Fed might be looking for. "Microsoft's stock is worth well more than it was some time ago, and it could still prove to be a bubble," Mr. Bernanke said, "but so far, so good."
Microsoft? Hello 1999! Is this what state-of-the-art monitoring gets us?
But Mr. Bernanke hasn't spoken about what may be a deeper problem: What if the Fed's loose monetary policy, with its giant bond purchases, is harmful?
If the price of lower unemployment were that hedge fund managers get a little richer, of course, we'd take the jobs. And if the choice were between helping someone get a job today or curtailing a potential crisis in the future, you put people to work now (though it depends on how big the crisis is likely to be).
But that might not be the choice. It sure seems as if Fed policy is helping only the wealthy, and not doing much for the economy. The net worth of the top 7 percent of American households rose in the first two years of the recovery, while the net worth of the bottom 93 percent declined. The percentage of working-age people who have jobs is dangerously low. Median income was lower in 2011 than it was in 1999. This cannot all be laid at the feet of the financial crisis. Working-age male income has been squeezed for decades. The economy has deeper problems.
Maybe monetary policy is simply reinforcing these trends.
Professional investors see it that way.
"What a lot of hedge fund managers are worried about is the inflation in asset prices, not cost and wages," said James Chanos, a noted hedge fund manager who is left of center. "This is leading to recurring booms and busts, which in addition are exacerbating income inequality."
The Fed has explicitly welcomed rising asset prices as a sign that its monetary policies are working, as lower rates push investors to put their money to work. But something is wrong. Companies are sitting on their profits. Businesses aren't investing and hiring enough.
In fact, the Fed may be inadvertently making things worse. What if it succeeds in bringing average people back into the markets right at the top? Is the Fed setting these poor suckers up to come in to buy from the hedge fund managers?
"The people you are trying to help don't get the message till the end of move," Mr. Chanos said. "You keep impoverishing them."
Now, I'm not remotely suggesting that the hedge fund denunciations are motivated out of a desire to help the unemployed. Please.
But they can read markets, and they can see that the Fed isn't engineering the hiring, inflation and recovery it would like. Instead of dismissing the critiques, the Fed and economists would do well to pay heed.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text:   LONDON -- After five years of dire warnings about the state of the British economy, the governor of the Bank of England raised the outlook for growth on Wednesday and said a recovery was "in sight."
Mervyn A. King, in his last scheduled news conference before retiring from the central bank in July, said the economy would grow faster and consumer prices would increase slower than was anticipated in February.
Britain's economy could grow by 0.5 percent this quarter after growing 0.3 percent in the first three months of this year, the Bank of England said. Inflation could peak at 3.1 percent toward the end of the summer, a lower level than had been expected.
"There is a welcome change in the economic outlook," Mr. King said. The "projections are for growth to be a little stronger and inflation a little weaker than we expected three months ago. That is the first time I have been able to say that since before the financial crisis."
The improved outlook is backed by a string of economic data from the last two months. The value of British homes rose to the highest level in almost three years in April, the mortgage lender Halifax said. An index measuring business confidence also increased, the services sector grew more than some economists expected in April and industrial output was stronger.
But Mr. King also said it was "no time to be complacent" because inflation remains above the central bank's target of 2 percent and the labor market is still weak. Threats to a sustained recovery continue to come from outside Britain, especially from the euro zone, its largest single export market, Mr. King said. The euro zone, of which Britain is not a part, on Wednesday reported its sixth consecutive quarter of economic decline.
Some economists maintained that Mr. King's outlook was too optimistic. David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce, a business lobby group, forecast that the speed of the recovery would be "somewhat slower" and that "our exporters will face obstacles over the year ahead."
Britain has been struggling to generate growth because concern about unemployment and rising consumer prices has cut into the disposable income of consumers. Banks have also been reluctant to lend, and businesses have held back on hiring and other investments. The government's austerity program, which includes a reduction of public pensions, benefits and jobs, has also depressed spending and investment.
Mr. King, who is being succeeded by Mark Carney of the Bank of Canada, said that the Bank of England would have to continue to strike a balance by trying to bring down inflation without hurting the economy. "Attempting to return inflation to target too rapidly would result in even slower growth and higher unemployment," he said.
Unemployment rose in the first three months of this year and wage increases dropped, according to the Office for National Statistics. Unemployment as calculated by the International Labor Organization rose 15,000 to 2.52 million, for a rate of 7.8 percent.
"Given the challenging economic conditions at the end of last year, it's unsurprising that we're now seeing fewer people in work," said Neil Carberry, director for employment and skills at the Confederation of British Industry, an employers' group. "What's encouraging, however, is that economic conditions seem to be improving and that full-time jobs are still being created."
To help the economy recover, the Bank of England left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 0.5 percent this month. Some economists expect the rate to remain at this record low for at least another year. After the slight improvement in the economic outlook, members of the Bank of England's rate-setting committee could decide to hold off adding economic stimulus by expanding the bank's bond-purchasing program.

Full text:   WE NEED NEW NAMES
By NoViolet Bulawayo
296 pages. Little, Brown & Company. $25.
"When things fall apart, the children of the land scurry and scatter like birds escaping a burning sky," NoViolet Bulawayo writes in her deeply felt and fiercely written debut novel. "They flee their own wretched land so their hunger may be pacified in foreign lands, their tears wiped away in strange lands, the wounds of their despair bandaged in faraway lands, their blistered prayers muttered in the darkness of queer lands." They leave behind their mothers and fathers and "the bones of their ancestors in the earth" -- they leave behind "everything that makes them who and what they are, leaving because it is no longer possible to stay."
The place they are leaving, in this case, is Zimbabwe, that African nation brutalized by more than 30 years of malignity and neglect under the autocratic rule of Robert Mugabe -- a country reeling, as the journalist Peter Godwin noted in his powerful 2011 book "The Fear" from unemployment, hunger, inflation, AIDS and the government's torture and violent intimidation of all political opposition. The place many of them are hoping to flee to is the United States -- the destination of the novel's young narrator, Darling, who will begin a new life there with her aunt.
Darling is 10 when we first meet her, and the voice Ms. Bulawayo has fashioned for her is utterly distinctive -- by turns unsparing and lyrical, unsentimental and poetic, spiky and meditative. It is the voice, early on, of a child -- observant, skeptical and hardhearted in the way children can be. She pinches a sick baby she does not want to hold in church so that he will cry and she can hand him back to his mother, and she is coldly standoffish when her long-absent father returns home from South Africa, having become sick with AIDS.
Darling processes the misfortunes of Zimbabwe and its politics through the eyes of a child -- talk of elections and hopes of change are something grown-ups engage in; she and her friends are more concerned with filling their empty stomachs with stolen guavas and inventing games to pass the time. School belongs to the time Before -- before the police came and bulldozed their houses, before they were all forced to move into tin shacks, before their fathers lost their jobs and life changed.
Using her gift for pictorial language, Ms. Bulawayo gives us snapshots of Zimbabwe that have the indelible color and intensity of a folk art painting: "men huddled like sheep and playing draughts under the lone jacaranda," the blooming purple flowers almost make them "look beautiful in the shade without their shirts on," sitting there, "crouched forward like tigers"; the women doing their best to look pretty, wearing "a bangle made from rusty, twisted wire," a "flower tucked behind an ear," "earrings made from colorful seeds," "bright patches of cloth sewn onto a skirt."
There is desperation here, however. As it becomes clear that elections have failed to bring about any kind of change, as men leave home in search of work and families fracture, young and old alike dream of escape -- to America or Europe, or failing that, South Africa, or maybe Dubai or Botswana, someplace where "at least life is better" than in this "terrible place of hunger and things falling apart."
Thanks to her Aunt Fostalina, who lives in "Destroyedmichygen" (Detroit, Michigan), Darling does make it to the United States. At first she is surprised by the astonishing variety and plenitude of food, by the wealth of everyday choices ("Do you prefer this or that? Are you sure? -- as if I have become a real person") and by the silent mystery of snow: it's like "we're in the crazy parts of the Bible, there where God is busy punishing people for their sins and is making them miserable with all the weather."
Once she is a teenager, she quickly adopts the habits of friends from school, even if she doesn't exactly care for them -- listening to Rihanna, trying on armfuls of clothing at the mall (and leaving them in huge messy piles in the dressing room) and watching pornography online. She acquires an American accent, gets A's in school ("because school is so easy in America even a donkey would pass") but resists her aunt's efforts to goad her into pursuing a career in medicine.
Darling promises her mother that she will come home for a visit soon, even though she knows she won't because she doesn't have the proper paperwork to return to America again. She misses the friends she grew up with, but at the same time feels estranged from them. One of them, Chipo, tells her on a Skype call that she can't refer to Zimbabwe as her country anymore, since she treated it as a burning house and ran away from it instead of trying to put out the flames: "Darling, my dear, you left the house burning and you have the guts to tell me, in that stupid accent that you were not even born with, that doesn't even suit you, that this is your country?"
Ms. Bulawayo gives us a sense of Darling's new life in staccato takes that show us both her immersion in and her alienation from American culture. We come to understand how stranded she often feels, uprooted from all the traditions and beliefs she grew up with, and at the same time detached from the hectic life of easy gratification in America. We hear her anger at white liberals who speak patronizingly about the troubles of "Africa," lumping together all the countries on that continent as though they were interchangeable parts of one big mess. And we come to understand the bittersweet emotions involved in the choice that many immigrants make to give their children names that will "make them belong in America."
At one point, in an effort to make Darling's experiences broadly representative, Ms. Bulawayo writes an entire chapter using the plural pronoun "we" -- speaking of the move to America, and the bitterness so many immigrants feel, as they are forced to take menial jobs or find their hopes frustrated:
"When we got to America we took our dreams, looked at them tenderly as if they were newly born children, and put them away; we would not be pursuing them. We would never be the things we had wanted to be: doctors, lawyers, teachers, engineers. No school for us, even though our visas were school visas. We knew we did not have the money for school to begin with, but we had applied for school visas because that was the only way out."
Such generalizations are the one misstep in this otherwise stunning novel. Not only because they try to project one point of view onto the experiences of a wide and varied group of immigrants, but also because they are not always true. For instance, the remarkably talented author of this book, the novel's jacket tells us, was "born and raised in Zimbabwe," and moved to the United States, where she earned an M.F.A. from Cornell and is now a Wallace Stegner Fellow at Stanford -- which sounds very much like a dream achieved.

Full text:   TOKYO -- Japan's economy grew at a robust annualized pace of 3.5 percent in the first quarter, preliminary data showed, the first sign that the bold monetary and economic policies of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe were starting to bear fruit.
Japanese growth came to 0.9 percent for the January-to-March period compared with a year ago, driven by higher household consumption and exports, government data showed. That beat market expectations of 0.7 percent for the quarter, or 2.8 percent for the annualized pace.
Exports grew 3.8 percent, pushed higher by strong shipments of cars and other manufactured goods to the United States on the back of a weaker yen, offsetting a slump in exports to China and Europe.
Personal consumption, which makes up the largest part of Japan's gross domestic product, grew 0.9 percent, as consumer sentiment brightened amid signs of an economic recovery.
The solid pace, which came after two quarters of contraction and a quarter of just 0.2 percent growth, appeared to point to the beginnings of a long-awaited turnaround in the world's third-largest economy, after the United States and China. "It is a sign that the Abe administration's economic policies are starting to show results," the economics minister, Akira Amari, said.
The latest numbers have come as early validation for Mr. Abe, who took office in December, and has used what has been called a three-arrowed bid to lift Japan out of its long deflationary slump. He has focused on an aggressive monetary policy that has flooded the economy with cheap money, major fiscal spending and reforms to make the economy more competitive.
Under Mr. Abe, the central bank has sought to double its monetary base and to generate inflation of 2 percent by 2014. This first arrow has been accompanied by a devaluation of the yen by some 20 percent in the last six months, which has been a boon for exporters. Exporters from Toyota to Sony have reported a rebound in profit in the first quarter of 2013, thanks in good part to the policy.
In recent days, however, concerns have grown over rising interest rates in the government bonds market, which could threaten Japan's monetary policy. Japan is vulnerable to rising borrowing because of its high public debt burden, which is twice the size of its economy.
Still, investors have piled into Japan's stock market, emboldened by expectations of rosy corporate profits and an economic recovery. The Nikkei stock index has risen by an astonishing 46 percent since Mr. Abe took office.
Japan is also getting a boost from the second arrow, more fiscal spending. Mr. Abe pushed through an emergency stimulus package of 10 trillion yen in February, and has followed up with a 92.6 trillion yen initial budget for 2013, which Japan's Parliament approved late Wednesday.
Economists say that for the economy to keep growing, the third arrow will be crucial: mainly structural reforms that aim to make the economy more competitive, for example by making Japan's labor market more flexible and lowering barriers to trade.
"For the rally to continue and be fundamentally driven, Abe must convince the market that his 'third arrow' will benefit Japan's underlying economy," the UBS economists Daiju Aoki and Toru Ibayashi said.

Abstract: Lia van Wijk, 58, the chief financial officer at a policy research center in Amsterdam, praises the Dutch retirement system, which combines a Social Security-like fund with a nearly universal pension system to which employers contribute. Fearing budget deficits and large unfunded retirement liabilities, the Netherlands has joined Britain, Italy, the United States and other countries in raising its retirement age, a move that increases contributions to the system while holding down outlays.

Full text:   THE United States can boast that it has the world's best basketball players, fighter jets and country and western singers. But hardly anyone would ever boast that the United States has the world's best retirement system.
Fifty-eight percent of American workers are not even in a pension or 401(k) plan. The Social Security system faces the threat of a huge shortfall. One-third of America's retirees get at least 90 percent of their retirement income from Social Security, with annual benefits averaging a modest $15,000 for an individual. And just ask any participant in a 401(k) plan about the scary roller-coaster ride of the last six years.
Scores of other countries have elaborate retirement systems, and some of them avoid the biggest pitfalls of America's retirement system.
In Australia, there is nearly universal participation among workers in a 401(k)-type retirement plan because of a government mandate. In the Netherlands, pension laws require that workers' 401(k)-like plans be converted into lifetime annuities to ensure they do not spend down all their savings before they turn 75 or 80.
In Britain, the government has pressed retirement fund managers to keep administrative fees on many plans to less than half the average in the United States.
A new report ranking various countries' retirement systems gives the United States a C, considerably worse than the A received by Denmark and the B-plus given to the Netherlands and Australia. The study, by the Mercer consulting firm and the Australian Center for Financial Services, weighs adequacy of benefits, breadth of coverage and other factors, and points to numerous weaknesses in the American system.
Those shortcomings include contribution rates too low to assure adequate retirements for middle-class Americans and many workers withdrawing large sums from their 401(k)'s before they retire.
The report also cites poverty-level retirement benefits for many low-income workers and pensions that fail to keep up with inflation. It also points to the common practice of retirees withdrawing large sums from their 401(k)'s soon after retiring, leaving many without an adequate income stream if they live past 80.
Lia van Wijk, 58, the chief financial officer at a policy research center in Amsterdam, praises the Dutch retirement system, which combines a Social Security-like fund with a nearly universal pension system to which employers contribute.
"It's rather a good system," she said, noting that she had at first worried that she would not have a large enough pension because she had once spent many years traveling abroad. But now she feels reassured, having steered additional money into her pension fund.
Ms. Van Wijk likes the Dutch system of converting workers' pension reserves into an annuity upon retirement. "There are real advantages to taking an annuity," she said.
She complained, however, that the Netherlands had increased its retirement age from 65 to 66 1/2. Fearing budget deficits and large unfunded retirement liabilities, the Netherlands has joined Britain, Italy, the United States and other countries in raising its retirement age, a move that increases contributions to the system while holding down outlays.
"The Dutch realize that there can be too much leakage," said Peter Kiveron, director of the Holland Financial Center, a research group, insisting that the United States and other countries make it too easy for people to take large amounts out of their 401(k)'s long before they retire and as soon as they retire, causing people to run out of funds well before they turn 75 or 80. "The Dutch have learned their lessons and have a very rigid system."
Even a cursory study of retirement systems abroad makes clear that many countries are far more willing than the United States to mandate painful steps by employers and workers.
Chile requires workers to contribute 10 percent of each paycheck to a 401(k)-type fund. In Australia, employers must contribute 9 percent of each worker's salary into a retirement fund, and that contribution is set to rise to 12 percent in 2020. Australia's politicians, conservative and liberal, concluded that the country's version of social security was providing retirees with too paltry a basic retirement check.
In the United States, such moves would prompt many to denounce heavy-handed grabs of workers' pay and expensive burdens on employers. But experts say it would be wise to study other nations' systems for tips on strengthening America's system.
John A. Turner, director of the Pension Policy Center in Washington, said some foreign features might not fit American culture, like mandated participation in the pension system as in Australia and Chile. He does not advocate such a mandate.
"We're quite different from many other countries," he said. "There's an emphasis on individual freedoms and rights and responsibilities versus collectivism -- although I admit we will never have high pension coverage without some form of mandate."
"In the United States, collective is a four-letter word," agreed Harry Smorenberg, head of a Netherlands-based consulting firm on pensions and founder of the World Pension Summit.
The United States does have some mandates, although they are often overlooked. Employers must pay 6.2 percent of each employee's salary into Social Security, and every employee must also contribute that amount.
A second pillar of America's retirement system -- 401(k)'s -- is voluntary, although some employers have embraced automatic enrollment for their employees while giving them the right to opt out. The third pillar is individual savings, including individual retirement accounts or I.R.A.'s. The Center for Retirement Research at Boston College warned that 53 percent of American households were at risk of not having enough to maintain their living standards in retirement.
Teresa Ghilarducci, a professor of economics at the New School, said America's voluntary system was badly broken because nearly six out of 10 workers were not in pension or 401(k) plans. She favors an Australia-type mandate.
"We use our tax code far more than other countries to try to encourage socially beneficial behavior," she said. "We're spending hundreds of billions of dollars to incent people to save for retirement through 401(k)'s and I.R.A.'s. That costs us a huge amount of money without much effect on getting people to save for retirement."
Other countries' systems offer a variety of contrasts:
¶ In France, the retirement age is 60, rising to 62 in 2017. In Britain, it is 67, with some calling that callously high. (Americans born from 1943 to 1959 qualify for full retirement benefits at age 66, and those born in 1960 or later qualify at 67, although people can begin receiving reduced retirement benefits at age 62.)
¶ In Chile, when women give birth, the government makes a special bonus contribution into their 401(k)-type plan to compensate for the months away from their job when they would not be contributing to those plans.
¶ In Sweden, if the nation's overall social security financing worsens from one year to the next, that country's fiscal guardians -- to prevent huge, unfunded liabilities -- set a slightly lower annual retirement benefit for all who reach retirement age that year (remaining unchanged until they die). And if Sweden's social security finances improve the following year, there is a recalculation, and those who reach retirement age the next year will receive slightly higher benefits throughout retirement.
¶ In Britain, when young workers first sign up for a 401(k)-type plan, the default option in the government's main new savings plan has them investing mainly in bonds -- while in the United States young workers are advised to invest mainly in stocks.
"In the U.K., they say first-time savers are very sensitive to losing money early on, so they put them in bond funds so they'll have positive returns," said David C. John, an economist at the AARP's Public Policy Institute. "As time goes on, they'll be moved more into equities."
¶ In the Netherlands, if a company is deemed unable to finance its long-term pension obligations, the central bank can order reduced benefits for current and future retirees to help keep the company afloat. United States law bars companies from reducing pension benefits they have contractually agreed to.
"We took drastic action to get these plans back into a safety zone," Mr. Smorenberg, the Dutch pension consultant, said.
¶ Singapore requires employees to contribute 20 percent of their pay and employers 16 percent toward a savings fund for retirement, health care and housing. The government guarantees a 2.5 annual return. Despite the high percentage contributed, many Singaporeans end up without enough money for retirement because they withdraw large sums to buy houses.
Despite such disparate strategies, many countries have similar worries. "Every country is worried about workers saving enough and about increasing longevity," Professor Ghilarducci said. "Every country is worried about investing retirement funds correctly, and every country wants to minimize risks to the taxpayer so there aren't large, unknown bills in the future."
In 1986, when Australia's social security program provided average retirement benefits of just one-third of preretirement pay, Parliament, pushed by labor unions, began requiring employers to contribute 3 percent of employee earnings into a 401(k)-like fund. When that still left many Australians near poverty in retirement, legislators increased the contribution to 9 percent.
Alan Matheson, 75, a retired social worker and minister who lives near Melbourne, said the Australian system had been good to him and his wife, Barbara, 69, a retired nurse. Both receive social security benefits while drawing from their retirement savings. "The system works well if you own a house," he said. "But if you don't own your own house or if you're single, things will be more difficult for you."
He said Australians backed the plan to raise retirement contributions to 9 percent and then 12 percent because "there's a widespread acceptance by the population that with the aging of the population, the government is not going to be able to pay its Age Pension," the Australian name for the social security system.
Australian workers have several investment options, including investment funds set up by companies and unions, and "retail" funds, much like mutual funds. Experts estimated that an Australian worker who contributes for 30 years into such a fund will have retirement income equal to 70 percent of preretirement pay -- the percentage that many experts recommend.
"Before compulsion we found that most people didn't save enough for retirement," said Ian Silk, chief executive of AustralianSuper, a multi-employer pension fund. He called the mandate "the single most important feature of the Australian system."
Dana M. Muir, a pension expert at the University of Michigan, opposes a compulsory plan like Australia's, but she said the United States should borrow one aspect of the Australian system: no legal liability if a company makes imprudent decisions in setting up a 401(k)-type plan. The risk of legal liability, Professor Muir said, is a big reason many American businesses decide not to set up 401(k) plans -- and a major reason the American participation rate is so low.
Although Australia's plan is praised, experts say it has one major flaw. It does not provide an annuity option for most retirees, meaning many run the risk of emptying out their retirement fund long before they die.
In 2007, New Zealand created the world's first nationwide, government-sponsored savings plan that automatically enrolls workers, while giving them the option not to participate.
The"KiwiSaver" plan -- built alongside the basic social security-type system -- gives employees the option of contributing 3, 4 or 8 percent of their pay, with employers required to contribute 3 percent. Workers choose which investment funds to put KiwiSaver money in, and those who do not choose are steered into six conservatively invested funds.
To encourage participation, the government provides a $1,000 tax-free "kick-start" contribution for each new participant upon enrollment, as well as a housing down payment of up to $5,000 after someone has participated in the program for three years.
The government determines investment offerings, but there are not dozens, as in the United States. "If you look at the U.S. experience," said Mr. John of the AARP, "having tons of investment alternatives drives some people away from participating."
Chile reformed its retirement system during the dictatorship of Gen. Augusto Pinochet. In 1981, he largely replaced the country's traditional social security-type plan with a 401(k)-type plan for everyone who entered the work force from that year onward.
Under the plan, 10 percent of each employee's salary was automatically deposited into a 401(k)-type retirement fund, with workers having a choice of investment options. Today more than 90 percent of Chilean workers are in the system, which resembles, but goes further than, the partial Social Security privatization that President George W. Bush pushed unsuccessfully.
Patricio Navia, a professor of political science at the Diego Portales University in Chile, said the system was effective in getting most Chileans to save significant amounts for retirement. But he said there were shortcomings. The number of major investment funds has shrunk to six, from 15, leaving limited competition that has resulted in high fees.
And those unemployed for long stretches or working in the informal economy often did not save enough for retirement, causing the government to adopt a supplementary system in 2008 to top up the retirement funds of low-income retirees.
Another problem: As many Chileans paid into their new 401(k)-type plans instead of social security, that strained the financing of the pay-as-you-go social security plan. "For the U.S., making such a transition would be extremely costly," Professor Navia said. "You can't meet all your obligations in the pay-as-you-go system without receiving the money from people who are still working."
In Britain, the government long had a voluntary savings program to supplement its main social security system. But officials grew alarmed that just a third of Britain's workers were participating, so it enacted a 401(k)-type program that all employers must participate in unless they already have pension plans.
Under the program, employers must enroll all their employees in a retirement plan, although workers can opt out. The employer contributes 3 percent of each worker's pay, the worker contributes 4 percent and the government 1 percent. The goal is to raise the worker participation rate to at least 70 percent.
"So far the opt-out rate is low -- that's very encouraging," said Jane Vass, director of public policy at Age UK, Britain's version of the AARP.
Many participants are not even choosing from the array of investment options. "The research shows that many employees didn't want a large amount of choice because that makes decisions more difficult," Ms. Vass said. "So the vast bulk of people go for the default scheme," often a target date fund.
Senator Tom Harkin, an Iowa Democrat, has proposed creating a mandatory retirement savings plan much like Britain's, with modest contributions by employers and employees. But in a country with a distaste for government mandates, his proposal could face rough going.
Mr. John of AARP said the United States could borrow only so much from other countries' ideas. "Each country's retirement system reflects their culture, their identity and their history," he said. "It would be a mistake to assume that because something works in country 'X' it will work in the United States."

Full text:   BIG market moves always give investors a bit of portfolio vertigo. Are you too close to the edge in terms of risk? Could you get burned again as in 2008?
Few retirement savers do a comprehensive review of their portfolios to see if the sum of the parts creates an unwieldy amount of risk. But by turning to some commonly used gauges in money management circles and asking some crucial questions, you can quantify your portfolio risk -- and decide how much will allow you to sleep at night.
An essential question to ponder first is your risk capacity -- that is, your ability to sustain a loss of a certain percentage without compromising your future standard of living. Some investors have several portfolios and other assets, so a hit to their stock holdings wouldn't impair their lifestyle over time. Others, however, are more vulnerable.
Your time horizon is a prime consideration. If you have decades before you withdraw retirement funds, you have time to bounce back from a market downturn; those in or near retirement may want to take less risk. And even if you have plenty of time, you may not be able to stomach much volatility.
"What is your investment horizon, and how long do you envision withdrawing funds?" asked Hal Ratner, chief investment officer of Morningstar's European investment advisory service, "and what is the likelihood that either of those periods might change?"
One fundamental way of seeing how your retirement kitty would suffer in a downturn is to vet the various risk measures of the funds or stocks in the portfolio.
For example, you can look at how the fund or stock performed during the worst years, focusing on the 2008 collapse. This is pretty simple to look up online with services like Yahoo Finance or Morningstar.
You can also look at an index fund that represents what you hold as a benchmark. For instance, one proxy for large-cap stocks is the SPDR S.& P. 500 exchange-traded fund, which lost nearly 38 percent in 2008. Could a catastrophic drop like that happen again? It's possible, but the more important question is, could you afford to lose nearly $4 out of $10 invested? Would you have enough time to recover from such a loss before you retired? Picking the right benchmark is important to see that you're comparing apples to apples.
Another useful indicator for mutual and exchange-traded funds, found on Morningstar.com, is an upside or downside capture ratio. When a fund rises, the upside capture ratio will tell you what percentage of the market's gain it's capturing. A good number is close to 100 percent. On the downside, when the market drops, you want that percentage to be smaller.
Individual stocks with long-term records can also be vetted for downside risk. Prices can be incredibly volatile -- particularly for big blue chips -- so pay attention to total return, which is the price and the dividend payment. Exxon Mobil, for example, one of the largest United States stocks by market capitalization, has had a seesaw price history as the market either favored or backed away from energy stocks. The company' stock lost 13 percent in 2008 and 12 percent in 2009, but has appreciated over the last three years.
For long-term stockholders, drops can offer opportunities, so downside risk isn't an absolute measure. If you plan to hold a dividend-paying stock like Exxon Mobil, you can always buy more shares at a lower price when it falls, at no commission if you're in the dividend-reinvestment plan that most big companies offer. But don't put most of your money in any single company, including your employer's. You'll compound risk in one holding, and there's no need to do that when you can own mutual or exchange-traded funds that own hundreds of securities.
Once you get an idea of how much a stock or fund can lose during a market crash, you need an idea of past and present volatility, which is measured by standard deviation, a statistic that shows variation from an average. High standard deviations reflect high price volatility and generally greater risk.
Advisers can examine your portfolio and measure standard deviation. Or you can find those numbers online. In any case, flag funds or stocks that have high standard deviations. Do they represent large portions of your portfolio? Do you have a good idea of what might happen to your wealth if they go south?
"The standard way of measuring risk is standard deviation," said Derek Tharp, a financial planner with Mote Wealth Management in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. When working with advisers, he cautioned investors to "look at what you want to accomplish -- how do you want to get you there?"
Doing a risk budget, that is, a written statement of how much risk you're willing to take, is part of the portfolio-planning process. You can always go for higher returns, but this always means accepting more risk. Your risk budget should be part of what money managers call an "investment policy statement." This is a set of written objectives for risk, return and long-term goals. Are you focused mainly on income, appreciation or a combination? These are essential details for your statement.
Experienced planners, Mr. Tharp suggested, can run analyses to see if your portfolio will realize your goals. A planner should be able to give you the probability of having enough to retire comfortably with your asset mix.
What if you or your adviser discovers that you're taking on too much risk? Simple adjustments can be made to reallocate to less risky assets, like bonds. While the value of stocks can evaporate in a bad downturn, bonds deliver an interest stream and the principal invested, regardless of what the market is doing.
But that doesn't mean you can't lose money in bonds. The worst year in the last 20 years for intermediate-term bonds was 1994, when they lost 5 percent in total return, according to Ibbotson Associates (though you don't lose money in government bonds if you hold to maturity). The next-worst year was a 2 percent loss in 2009. So ratcheting up your bond holdings is generally good for capital preservation.
Just keep an eye on credit risk, diversification and inflation. You can still lose money in bonds if the issuer defaults, or you could miss out on a better opportunity if interest rates rise. You are most vulnerable in bond mutual funds or if you trade them.
Ultimately, creating a prudent portfolio means having a conversation. Talk about it with your advisers, spouse or partner at least once a year.
What you can expect in any given year is a subject that Cathy Pareto, a financial planner in Coral Gables, Fla., says she discusses with clients: "Plot out a chart. What's a realistic range of returns in actual dollar amounts? When markets are doing well, everyone wants to take on more risk. But what is your specific objective?"
When you sift through all of your portfolio vulnerabilities, you need to ask two key questions: What's the worst case for what I own, and would a loss based on that dire case hurt my lifestyle in the future?
If you're a long-term investor or won't need your nest egg for decades, you have some flexibility. If not, you need to make some changes to reduce risk. If you see the amount of risk you have will imperil your future lifestyle, now's the time to take action: don't wait for the market to tank to spur you to action.

Abstract: [...]why does Mr. Obama keep talking to them about a deal? Because Republicans still have powerful incentives to strike one. For one thing, a new Congressional Budget Office report on Tuesday eased one source of pressure for a deal. Because of higher-than-expected revenues and slower-than-expected spending growth, the budget office projected that the 2013 deficit would be $642 billion -- $200 billion less than projected just three months ago, and less than half its size from four years ago as a proportion of the economy.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Ask around the White House and the Capitol, and you will quickly find reasons to doubt that Republicans will compromise with President Obama on a budget deal that includes more tax increases and spending cuts in social programs.
So why does Mr. Obama keep talking to them about a deal? Because Republicans still have powerful incentives to strike one.
Delaying steps to rein in Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, the subjects of Republican doomsday warnings for years, means delaying significant attempts to curb the size of the government. The longer the delay, the sharper and more immediate the changes Washington must eventually make to ease the long-term fiscal squeeze.
Even if Republicans take control of Congress and the White House in the next two elections -- allowing them to put in place a budget plan without major compromises -- they would then shoulder the political responsibility for the inevitable pain that comes from curbing those huge and popular programs. Much as Republicans may dislike Mr. Obama and his policies, a Democratic president can provide them a measure of political cover.
"There are Republicans who believe that we should wait," Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, said at a fiscal meeting held by the Peter G. Peterson Foundation last week. "If we wait until 2017, which in essence is what they're saying, I think we're taking a huge risk."
That may be precisely what happens. For one thing, a new Congressional Budget Office report on Tuesday eased one source of pressure for a deal. Because of higher-than-expected revenues and slower-than-expected spending growth, the budget office projected that the 2013 deficit would be $642 billion -- $200 billion less than projected just three months ago, and less than half its size from four years ago as a proportion of the economy.
For another, events of recent years have repeatedly proven the political difficulty of overhauling benefit programs. President George W. Bush tried in 2005 to restructure Social Security through partial privatization, and a Republican Congress, frightened of political fallout, refused. After Republicans fueled by Tea Party fervor recaptured the House in 2010, conservatives had new hopes of trimming social programs.
But Congressional Republicans, while winning cuts in "discretionary" spending, failed to strike a "grand bargain" curbing entitlements. Mr. Obama won re-election over a Republican ticket that, as Mr. Bush had done, proposed a fundamental restructuring in the nature of a major entitlement program benefiting older Americans.
This time it was Medicare. Mr. Obama derided the Republican proposal as a "voucher" plan that would shift financial burdens onto elderly beneficiaries.
"The notion of large-scale entitlement reform has lost its appeal," said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a Republican economist, citing a shift in attention toward overhauling the tax code. "You can't fix it with this Congress and this president."
President Obama, having accepted many more spending cuts than tax increases since Republicans won the House in 2010, has set additional tax increases as the price of an entitlement deal. The House speaker, John A. Boehner of Ohio, and the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, having acquiesced to end most of the high-end Bush tax cuts late last year, have ruled out further tax increases.
Substantively, opponents of a compromise argue that further tax increases would harm the economy. Mr. Obama and Senate Democrats, the opponents say, will never accept the structural changes needed for the government's long-term solvency anyway.
Politically, resisting tax increases would shield Republican incumbents from primary challenges. A recovering economy is already shrinking near-term deficits. And deferring unpopular cuts on entitlements could help Republicans win back the Senate in 2014 and the White House in 2016.
Yet other Republicans fear that stepping away from the bargaining table could saddle the party with a different problem. Without cuts in entitlement programs, which can only come through a deal with Mr. Obama, Republican leaders will have trouble making Congress do something they acknowledge it must do -- raise the debt limit.
Two years ago, Republicans approached a similar moment lifted by two significant tail winds. Jittery financial markets joined voters in backing Republican demands for spending cuts. Mr. Obama needed to negotiate deep ones -- now known as sequestration -- to defer the threat of a government default past his re-election campaign.
Those winds have shifted. Safely re-elected, Mr. Obama has promised not to negotiate any further on the debt limit. He and his advisers believe that House Republicans, who face re-election next year, have more to lose politically over a showdown.
Some Republicans agree with them.
"The president's not at risk -- our majority's at risk," said Representative Tom Cole, an Oklahoma Republican who serves on the House Budget and Appropriations Committees. "You plunge the country into economic crisis, you lose your majority."
He predicted "a very substantial" compromise with the White House this year, pushing debt limit votes past the 2014 election.
Many Republicans fault Mr. Obama for resisting structural changes to entitlements as well as lesser changes, like raising the Medicare eligibility age, which he entertained in 2011. But Mr. Cole, like Mr. Portman, credits the president for proposing or signaling that he will bargain on reduced inflation adjustments for Social Security benefits and other government programs; additional "means testing" for Medicare, which would reduce benefits for high-income recipients; and increased out-of-pocket costs for some beneficiaries.
"Those are all worthwhile steps, and we should grab every one of them," said R. Glenn Hubbard, who advised Mr. Bush's administration and Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential campaign.
Having seen both fall short in seeking far-reaching entitlement changes, Mr. Hubbard endorsed the idea of a narrower compromise so long as the tax increases it contained did not raise marginal rates, which he considers most harmful to economic growth.
"This notion that you're going to wait for a grand bargain -- in our process, you could wait an awful lot of time for that to happen," said Mr. Hubbard, now the dean of Columbia University's Business School. "The longer we wait, the greater the risk that current beneficiaries will have to be cut."
As for the political calculus of entitlement curbs, he added, "It's much better for Republicans to have it happen on President Obama's watch."
Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the House Budget Committee chairman and a leading Republican advocate of entitlement changes, appears to be trying to keep the possibility of such a limited deal alive through slowly developing negotiations with his Senate Budget Committee counterpart, Senator Patty Murray of Washington. It hinges on tax code changes -- and politically consequential word-parsing over whether additional revenue would come from tax increases or economic growth.
"The question is, can we make divided government work?" Mr. Ryan asked at the Peterson Foundation session. "Can we get a down payment on the problem?"
For all the resistance on the right to compromise, some conservative economists still hope so.
"The problem will be so much worse in four years," said Joseph Antos, a former official in President Ronald Reagan's administration who is now at the American Enterprise Institute. He predicted that Congressional Republicans would ultimately accept a bargain including modest additional tax increases, but only after "the maximum amount of political hell."
But to call this approach a strategy, Mr. Antos added, is "very generous."

Full text:   Stocks rallied to new highs on Tuesday as investors picked up large companies' shares on the expectation that stimulus by the Federal Reserve would help propel the rally further.
Gains were broad, but growth sectors outperformed their peers, with bank stocks leading the way. Bank of America, up 2.8 percent, at $13.34, was the Dow's biggest percentage gainer, and Citigroup rose 2.4 percent, to $50.09.
Wall Street has rallied without a significant correction since the beginning of the year, pushing major indexes to highs and pushing the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index up almost 16 percent for 2013.
The ascent has been driven in large part by the Federal Reserve's easy monetary policy, intended to stimulate the economy, though investors' focus has turned to when the Fed may start to rein in its bond-buying program.
"The developed economies of the world are all easing aggressively, the money is looking for a home and it's ending up in the stock markets," said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Ala.
For now, investors are betting that the central bank will be careful not to remove its support too soon, to keep from disrupting the economic recovery it is trying to foster, Mr. Hellwig said.
So far, declines in the market have been met with buying, and investors are trying to gauge how long that can last.
"People are, indeed, trying to participate in the rally, but at the same time, they're trying to be cautious," said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer of Commonwealth Financial, based in Waltham, Mass.
The S.& P. 500 financial sector index rose 1.7 percent.
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 123.57 points, or 0.82 percent, to close at 15,215.25. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 16.57 points, or 1.01 percent, to end at 1,650.34. Both indexes hit highs, without adjusting for inflation. The Nasdaq composite index climbed 23.82 points, or 0.69 percent, to 3,462.61, its highest close since November 2000.
During the session, the Dow hit an intraday high, not adjusted for inflation, of 15,219.55, while the S.& P. 500 climbed to a similar intraday high of 1,651.10.
The Nasdaq touched a 52-week intraday high of 3,468.67.
The market traded sideways for the last three sessions, gaining just 0.07 percent as the winding down of the quarterly earnings season and a light economic calendar left investors without a strong catalyst for further gains.
The Dow's gains were limited by weakness in Intel, down 1 percent at $23.84, and the UnitedHealth Group, off 1.1 percent at $61.73.
Sony shares listed in the United States rose 9.9 percent, to $20.76, after the hedge fund investor Daniel Loeb called on the company to spin off its lucrative entertainment arm.
Nokia unveiled a new version of its Lumia smartphone line, but its shares fell 5.2 percent, to $3.64, on the New York Stock Exchange. The research company Gartner said Nokia lost 5 percentage points of market share in the first quarter, to 14.8 percent.
Solar power companies' shares fell after Trina Solar lowered a previous estimate for panel shipments and said its results would be hurt by a foreign currency exchange loss. The stock fell 8.8 percent to $5.41, while Yingli Green Energy slid 6.4 percent to $2.36.
Most corporate earnings have exceeded expectations this quarter. With 90 percent of the S.& P. 500 companies having reported results, 67.2 percent have topped earnings expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data, even with the average over the last four quarters. However, only 46.9 percent have exceeded revenue estimates, below the 52 percent average over the same period.
The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 19/32 to 97 29/32, pushing the yield up to 1.98 from 1.92 on Monday.

Full text:   BRUSSELS -- Europeans have never been wild about the European Union. With the region sapped by the euro crisis, confidence in the institution and the benefits it was supposed to provide is flagging faster and further than ever before, according to an influential opinion survey released Monday.
The results of an annual survey by the Pew Research Center, a nonpartisan organization based in Washington, show a deepening disillusionment with the union in major member countries.
The results of the survey suggest that more citizens than ever could end up opposing the transfer of more power to European Union institutions that may be vital for transforming the euro into a viable currency over the long term.
"The effort over the past half-century to create a more united Europe is now the principal casualty of the euro crisis," according to a report that Pew published with the survey results. The title of the report summed it up: "The New Sick Man of Europe: the European Union."
The poll pointedly noted that, "No European country is becoming more dispirited and disillusioned faster than France." Last year, 60 percent of the French surveyed said they had a favorable impression of the European Union. This year only 41 percent did, a decline of 19 percentage points that was the biggest annual drop among the countries surveyed.
The results corresponded to some degree to the health of a nation's economy. Only Greeks and Italians professed less belief in the benefits of economic union than the French, according to Pew. In Germany, 60 percent held a favorable impression of the union.
That could have everything to do with the listless economy in France, which is on the verge of joining much of Southern Europe in recession and has an unemployment rate of 11 percent. The German economy has fared better and has a relatively low unemployment rate of 5.4 percent.
"French and the Germans differ so greatly over the challenges facing their economies that they look as if they live on different continents, not within a single European market," the authors of the Pew report wrote. As a result, the "French look less like Germans and a lot more like the Spanish, the Italians and the Greeks."
The gloomy view is understandable given the economic crisis in Europe.
"The limits of the European Union institutional architecture are perceived more directly by the citizens now," said Enzo Moavero Milanesi, Italy's minister for European affairs, in an interview. "They have always been known, but citizens expected a more rapid and efficient response to the crisis and ended up complaining about the lengthy procedures, the many meetings, the difficult discussions.
"But it's a paradox," said Mr. Milanesi. "The E.U. has made great steps toward further integration and a strengthened monetary union. We even started discussing forms of possible political union, but people are still disappointed."
One of the smallest declines in sentiment -- two percentage points, to 43 percent -- was in Britain. But the economic union has never been popular there.
"We should try and renegotiate our relationship with the European Union," said William Drake, co-founder of the investment advisory firm Lord North Street in London, expressing an opinion shared by many in his country. He added that many regulations were "not being properly discussed and debated by our own democratically elected Parliament. It sort of feels like we don't rule our own country anymore."
The polls were conducted during March in Germany, Britain, France, Italy, Spain, Greece, Poland and the Czech Republic, by telephone or in person, with between 700 and 1,100 adults in each country. Each poll has a margin of sampling error of either three or four percentage points.
In France, where voters eight years ago rejected a constitutional treaty meant to streamline decision-making in the European Union and lay out a blueprint for its future, 77 percent of Pew survey respondents said this year that European economic integration had made things worse for their country. That was an increase of 14 percentage points from the previous poll.
Many opinions in Greece and Italy were harsher. One Italian interviewed Monday, Anna Nardi, said her country's high debt and economic recession indicated that Italy had "lost out" so far as a member of the union.
"But now there are no alternatives," said Ms. Nardi, who is co-chief executive, with her sister, of an outdoor furniture factory in Vicenza, which exports more than half of its goods to other countries in the union. The trouble, she said, was her own country's poor track record in sticking to laws and rules agreed to in Brussels.
"The E.U. says do 'X' and you've got Germany, which applies it 1,000 percent, while countries like Italy or Spain try to find loopholes so that they can get around the issue," she said. "These discrepancies have to be overcome."
Among the French, the Pew survey found a reluctance to provide financial assistance to other member states in trouble.
"Since the euro, everything has all just gotten more expensive," Eric Holenreith, a 37-year-old maintenance worker for the city of Paris, said Monday in an interview.
"We were already overtaxed and now we are sending all this money to Brussels and to help the people in Greece or Spain or wherever," Mr. Holenreith said. "But now these people have no work because of the crisis and they are coming here looking for jobs. It has me worried because there are already not enough jobs for the French."
Sylvia Maucuer, 55, who owns a pharmacy in Paris, said the spate of economic rescue packages for France's neighbors had exposed wide gaps in governments' fiscal discipline. "Everyone is not making the same effort," she said.
One surprise in the Pew findings is that the German public might not be as opposed to providing financial aid to other European countries as the country's policy makers often suggest.
Since the Greek debt crisis exploded three years ago, lawmakers in creditor nations like Germany have warned that their own taxpayers will not accept the mounting costs of bailouts. But among the richer nations surveyed, the Germans were most likely to be willing to extend such aid, though it was with the support of only 52 percent of the Pew respondents.
And only in Germany among the countries surveyed did at least half the public say they supported giving more power to Brussels to deal with the economic crisis. The survey "contradicts oft-repeated narratives about the Germans: that they are paranoid about inflation, disinclined to bail out their fellow Europeans and debt-obsessed," the report said.
That result could buoy some Europeans' hopes that after national elections in Germany in September the government could move more swiftly to adopt policies letting the country share more financial risks with other Union members, a step that many economists regard as the only way to overcome the crisis.
In Germany, support for the euro remains strong, in part because the single currency helps Germany's export-oriented economy. But there is also concern about the cost of the euro zone crisis and the lack of a strong system to ensure fiscal discipline among euro zone countries.
"I am in favor of the euro if we get to fix its problems," Ulf Mark Schneider, chief executive of Fresenius, a health care company listed on Germany's blue-chip DAX index, said Monday by e-mail. "Ever larger bailouts or lower interest rates will not get the job done, structural reforms are needed. The core problem of the euro is that monetary policy is fully harmonized and fiscal policy is not."
Mr. Schneider said the euro zone needed a better system for making decisions, rather than the ad hoc crisis management that existed now.

Full text:   LAST July, when the Dow Jones industrial average was still stuck below 12,900 and investors were seeking safety in bonds, Seth J. Masters made a startling argument.
Mr. Masters, the chief investment officer of Bernstein Global Wealth Management, said that people were so traumatized by the financial crisis that they were seriously underestimating the stock market. In fact, the chances were quite good that by the end of the decade, the Dow would rise more than 7,000 points and reach 20,000, he said.
In some important ways, he said, stocks at that moment had become safer than bonds. "This argument may seem provocative," he told me back then. "But that's only because market conditions are so unusual, and so many people have become so pessimistic."
Last week, Mr. Masters made essentially the same argument, but it sounded much less provocative. In fact, after months of soaring prices, new stock market records and minuscule bond yields, it may even be the Wall Street consensus.
"It seems we're somewhat ahead of schedule but I think we're still on track for Dow 20,000 by the end of the decade," Mr. Masters said last week. "The odds have just gotten better." And despite the stock market's recent meteoric rise, he said, stocks still look relatively cheap, certainly compared with bonds.
"It's not that the expected return on stock right now is really that high," he said. "It's that the return on government bonds is indubitably very low."
That unfavorable verdict on bonds is no accident. In a sense, it's the policy of the Federal Reserve. Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, says he is trying to make traditionally riskier assets like stocks relatively attractive, increasing investors' wealth and in that way stimulating the economy.
As far as the bond market goes, the yield on a benchmark 10-year Treasury note was only 1.5 percent when I spoke to Mr. Masters in July, and it is about 1.9 percent now. To put those yields in perspective, the average for 10-year bonds since 1962 has been more than 6.5 percent, according to quarterly Bloomberg data. In other words, since last July, bond yields have risen by the tiniest bit, and they remain extraordinarily low, on a historical basis.
For bond investors, particularly retirees, these low yields pose a serious dilemma. "This situation creates great problems for people trying to live off the income they can get from bonds," Mr. Masters said. (I'll explore this issue further in a future column.)
For now, it's worth noting that the problem for income-seekers will sort itself out eventually when bond yields rise and prices fall. But that shift is likely to inflict considerable harm on unwary investors.
That day of reckoning keeps receding, however, as global economic growth and inflation remain constrained. That alone tends to keep bond rates low. Furthermore, government spending cuts like the budget sequestration in the United States have reduced economic growth substantially, in the view of the International Monetary Fund and other forecasters.
And as long as unemployment is high and inflation is low, the Fed says it will continue to keep short-term interest rates near zero -- and buy $85 billion a month in long-term bonds and other securities. Other central banks have made similar promises. At least for a while, then, historically low interest rates seem likely to persist, for short-term bills as well as for long-term bonds.
The likelihood of low bond yields helps explain the relatively high stock market returns expected by Mr. Masters. And a new study suggests that those yields are the main factor behind the bullish stock market consensus of financial analysts on Wall Street and in academia.
Fernando Duarte and Carlo Rosa, two economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, described their study last week in "Are Stocks Cheap? A Review of the Evidence," a posting on the New York Fed's Liberty Street Economics blog. They analyzed 29 separate economic models and found that most predicted extremely high stock returns for the next five years. Why? There are many wonky reasons but in the end, they said, it is "mainly due to exceptionally low Treasury yields at all foreseeable horizons."
This may be the prevailing view among professional analysts, but mutual fund flows suggest the great mass of investors have not yet embraced it. Over the last seven years, according to calculations by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, mutual fund investors worldwide have poured a net $1.1 trillion into bond funds, and taken $900 billion out of stock funds.
In the United States, investors began moving some money back into stock funds in January, but not all that much. So far this year, they poured significantly more into bond funds -- $85.4 billion into bonds compared with only $73.2 billion into stocks, according to Investment Company Institute estimates. And in the week ending May 1, the institute's preliminary numbers show, the outflow from stock funds had resumed, with a net withdrawal of $4.4 billion.
Clearly, individual investors are still holding a relatively high allocation of fixed-income securities in their portfolios. That suggests that there is plenty of fuel for further stock market rallies.
NONE of this implies that high stock market returns are a sure thing, however. To the contrary, Mr. Masters said: "I don't think the path to Dow 20,000 will be linear -- and it certainly won't be a straight line up. There will be declines, you can count on that."
Mr. Duarte and Mr. Rosa wondered whether market returns were predictable at all, saying, "The jury is still out on this one, and the debate among academics and practitioners is alive and well."
Mr. Masters noted that his forecast assumes economic growth of more than 3 percent this year and comfortable earnings by American companies. Those assumptions -- and many others -- could lead investors astray. Like nearly everybody else, his firm assigned a low probability to an event like the financial crisis. It could well miss another catastrophe, and so he advises a cautious, diversified approach to investing.
With those caveats, he said he had used all of the information available to calculate the prospects for the market. "I still think that the best forecast for the rest of the decade is Dow 20,000," he said.

Full text:   Finance ministers from leading global economies on Saturday avoided a public rift with Japan over policies driving down the value of its currency, while keeping up pressure on Germany to help lift growth in Europe.
At the end of two days of talks among the Group of 7 finance ministers outside London, other nations appeared to accept -- at least for now -- Japan's explanation that its new monetary efforts were meant to stimulate its domestic economy, rather than to drive down the yen on international currency markets.
The chancellor of the Exchequer in Britain, George Osborne, said on Saturday that ministers from the G-7, made up of the United States, Germany, Japan, Britain, Italy, France and Canada, had reaffirmed earlier commitments on exchange rates and agreed to make sure policies are "oriented towards achieving domestic objectives." Other officials described the talks as in-depth and positive. Last week, the dollar breached the 100-yen mark for the first time in over four years.
The two-day meeting, in Buckinghamshire, also focused on efforts to stem tax avoidance and on banking reform, and Mr. Osborne said it was "important to complete swiftly our work to ensure that no banks are too big to fail." The officials discussed efforts to create a European banking union, which have slowed in recent months.
"We agreed on the importance of ensuring banks' balance sheets are adequately capitalized to enable them to play their role in supporting the economy," Mr. Osborne said.
The talks took place against a background of growing austerity fatigue in Europe, and concern that the region's focus on reducing deficits and debt risked driving some economies into a downward spiral.
One United States Treasury official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said there was a recognition that, because of the economic weakness in southern European nations like Greece, Portugal and Spain, it was "more important than ever" to have higher private demand in the euro zone countries that are performing better. Germany has the most room to lift demand, although the Treasury official did not identify it or other countries by name.
The official added that recent, positive suggestions that France and Spain should have more time to reduce their budget deficits would be helped by "a greater contribution of private demand" from better-performing European countries.
But a German official, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity, disputed any consensus on that point, noting that there was no official statement on the matter after the meeting. As planned, no communiqué was issued after the event. The idea of stimulating domestic demand is contentious in Germany, in part because of the risk of stoking inflation.
Nevertheless, the German finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, seen as one of the main architects of the euro zone's austerity policies, has shown some signs of greater flexibility and said, before the meeting, that he supported the European Union's move to give France and Spain more time for deficit reduction.
Slow growth in much of the developed world, and particularly in Europe, provided an uncertain backdrop to the meeting, despite efforts by several central banks to stimulate economic activity.

Full text:   On its face, Friday's announcement that the nation's gross domestic product expanded at a 2.5 percent annual rate in the first quarter was good news, following as it did an only marginally positive result for the previous three-month period.
But, alas, that rosy headline figure masked disturbing signs: an economy whose recovery has failed to match the pace of past expansions may now be facing a deceleration in its own modest growth rate.Start with the G.D.P. figures, which can be misleading because of temporary fluctuations in the inventories maintained by businesses. Adjusted for those changes, the economy's annualized growth rate shows a steady deceleration over the past three quarters, from 2.4 percent to 1.9 percent to 1.5 percent.
That's on top of a highly disappointing employment report for March, when only 88,000 new jobs were created, compared with an average of 197,000 for the previous six months.
And other economic measures -- ranging from retail sales to the index of leading economic indicators -- have begun to display softness and even declines. All told, at a minimum, we have entered yet another spring slowdown.
Perhaps it will prove transitory, as the pauses of the past three years have been. But worrisome signs suggest that this time may, indeed, be different.
For one thing, hourly wages, after adjustment for inflation, haven't budged in more than three years. That's unusual during an ostensible period of recovery, particularly from such a vicious recession.
Without higher incomes, consumers can't expand their purchases (at least not without dipping into their savings).
Meanwhile, Washington's budget wars have thus far produced a fistful of undesirable policy changes. Instead of thoughtful reforms -- particularly to programs like Medicare and Social Security -- to begin to bring the nation's long-term debt under control, Congress has adopted a series of meat-ax measures.
While that has shrunk the federal deficit significantly -- this year, the deficit is likely to come in at around $775 billion, compared with $1.1 trillion in the previous year -- the sudden contraction is likely to slow the economy further, cutting the growth in America's economic output this year by about 1.5 percentage points. Using basic yardsticks, that measures out to 1.5 million fewer jobs.
Finally, the weak world economy has knocked one American strategy for ratcheting up growth -- faster increases in exports -- badly off the rails. Just three years ago, United States exports were expanding at a 27 percent annual rate; today they are barely growing, and sales to Europe's hard-hit economies are declining.
To be sure, unlike Europe, where countries have faced double-dip recessions (and, in some cases, the prospect of a triple-dip), the United States is highly unlikely to experience a similar fate.
Our economy still exhibits some signs of strength, like the gathering recovery in housing construction and home prices. That has been aided by a strong stock market, which has rebuilt the value of retirement accounts and other investments.
But without rising incomes (and with mortgage financing still constrained), Americans' ability to buy new homes will remain limited.
Meanwhile, the stock market recovery has been built on the shaky pilings of higher corporate profitability that has resulted far more from cutting costs than from growing revenues. That's not sustainable.
The challenges listed above, of course, would be substantial by themselves.
But the most worrisome aspect of our current economic doldrums is that we can't expect any of the factors weighing on it to be self-correcting. For example, the lack of wage growth owes much to the continuing effects of globalization, a trend that has benefited the United States as a whole while hurting many workers.
Nor are the prospects bright for renewed expansion in Europe, or for a resumption of the meteoric growth rates we once saw in emerging market nations, particularly in China.
Were Washington functional, policy makers could significantly ameliorate these effects. First and foremost, Congress could adopt budget policies that would accomplish more thoughtful, more gradual -- and yet, ultimately, more substantial -- deficit reduction.
Instead of deep, across-the-board cuts in many important investment programs, ranging from infrastructure to research and development, we need to protect those initiatives while adjusting our social welfare programs to live within our means and protect the truly needy.
To address the effects of globalization, so much more can be done in education and training to prepare workers for the skilled jobs that play better to America's strengths.
Congress would be doing the American people a service if it came together to tackle these more consequential questions, and not just the problem of air-traffic delays.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text:   LONDON -- With the British economy showing feeble signs of resilience and a new central bank governor waiting in the wings, the Bank of England decided on Thursday to keep its benchmark interest rate and its economic stimulus program unchanged.
The central bank left its interest rate at 0.5 percent, a record low, and held its program of bond-buying at £375 billion, or about $581 billion. The stimulus program, also known as quantitative easing, frees more money for lending to businesses and individuals.
Some economists expect the Bank of England to expand its stimulus program this year to help the recovery, while others said recent economic data were encouraging and that further stimulus might not be necessary.
Where they agree is that any action would probably wait until the next central bank governor, Mark Carney, takes over in July from Mervyn A. King, who has held the position since 2003.
"There are broad improvements in business sentiment, and with equity markets heading to new highs, we are not expecting anything" until Mr. Carney arrives, said James Knightley, an economist in London with ING Bank.
The British economy narrowly avoided falling back into a recession for a third time in five years at the beginning of this year. The 0.3 percent growth it recorded in the first three months of this year was hardly a sign of a robust recovery, but it allowed George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, to dispel critics of his austerity measures, who had argued that spending cuts and tax increases would pull Britain back into a recession.
While still in decline, the manufacturing and construction industries shrank less than some economists had expected in April and the services sector also strengthened last month. Economic confidence is improving and house prices increased to the highest level in almost three years in April, according to Halifax, a mortgage lender.
Under pressure to show his austerity program was indeed repairing the British economy by reducing the budget deficit without choking off growth, Mr. Osborne in March gave the Bank of England more flexibility in supporting the economy without the need to lower inflation in the short term.
Consumer price inflation is at 2.8 percent, above the Bank of England's 2 percent target. Prices have been climbing faster in Britain than in the euro zone or the United States, squeezing households as salaries remain broadly unchanged.
The European Central Bank cut its benchmark interest rate to a record low of 0.5 percent from 0.75 percent last week. The move was widely expected and was seen as mostly symbolic, to show that the E.C.B. president, Mario Draghi, was willing to act to bolster the euro zone as recession threatened to engulf countries that were previously spared, like Germany.
The troubles in the euro zone have been weighing on Britain, which is a member of the European Union but not part of the euro zone. The region is Britain's largest single export market. Mr. Osborne repeatedly pointed to weak demand for goods and services from the euro zone as a reason for the slow recovery of the British economy.
Mr. Knightley is among those economists who expect the arrival of Mr. Carney at the helm of the Bank of England, in two months, to bring some change there.
Mr. Carney, now the governor of the Bank of Canada, might be more specific about what to expect from interest rates in the future, Mr. Knightley said. Few economists expect interest rates to increase before the end of next year.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Abstract: Instead of focusing on keeping overnight interest rates close to zero -- which seemed to be having little effect in reviving growth -- the central bank aimed to double the amount of money in circulation, seeking to produce annual inflation of about 2 percent. The central bank is following an asset purchase program to inflate the economy by aggressively buying longer-term bonds and doubling its government bond holdings in two years.

Full text:   TOKYO -- For almost two decades Japan's economic fortunes have deteriorated, and little seemed to be done about it.
But in the last few months, the nation's new prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has pushed policy makers and other officials to take bold steps to revive one of the world's largest economies. Their handiwork was evident on Thursday when the Japanese yen hit 100 to the dollar for the first time in four years.
Normally a weakening exchange rate might be taken as a sign of decline. The yen has fallen nearly 14 percent against the dollar this year, and no currency has fallen more except the Venezuelan bolívar. But in Japan's case, it is a sign that the policies put in place by Mr. Abe and Haruhiko Kuroda, chairman of the Bank of Japan, are starting to work. A weaker yen makes Japanese exports more competitive around the world.
The most immediate impact of the weaker yen has been the boost in profits of the major exporters. This week, the Toyota Motor Corporation reported net income in the last 12 months jumped threefold, and Sony produced an annual profit for the first time in five years. Both companies forecast further profit increases largely because of the weaker yen.
Perhaps more important, particularly for the citizens of Japan who have suffered from a long period of falling wages and prices, the yen's move is expected to kindle inflation in the once moribund economy.
Bank of Japan has moved aggressively to reinvigorate the economy and fight deflation. Last month, the central bank announced a decisive break with its earlier policies. Instead of focusing on keeping overnight interest rates close to zero -- which seemed to be having little effect in reviving growth -- the central bank aimed to double the amount of money in circulation, seeking to produce annual inflation of about 2 percent.
"This is new territory for the Bank of Japan, and the market is responding to that," said Aroop Chatterjee, foreign exchange strategist at Barclays Capital in New York. "The Bank of Japan announced very strong monetary policy easing at the start of April."
However, he said the more immediate trigger for the rate to cross Thursday's threshold was signs of strength in the United States economy.
Amari Akira, Japan's economic revitalization minister, quickly focused attention away from Japan's role in weakening its own currency, in a bid to stave off accusations that Japan was manipulating the yen to bolster its exports. Rather, he said the dollar's strength reflected investors' hopes for an economic comeback in the United States.
"It's the dollar that's in demand because economic recovery in America is gathering steam," Mr. Amari said at a morning news conference.
The efforts by the Bank of Japan to continue to flood the economy with liquidity is likely to keep downward pressure on the yen in the coming months. The central bank is following an asset purchase program to inflate the economy by aggressively buying longer-term bonds and doubling its government bond holdings in two years.
By mid-morning in Tokyo on Friday, the dollar was trading at 101.09 yen.
Japanese officials say the policy does not overtly pursue a lower yen rate, which could raise tensions with other exporting nations like the United States. But a weaker yen is a welcome development in some ways.
The depreciation of the yen may be a step in the right direction as the authorities try to stimulate some growth. However, Japan still faces many stiff challenges until it breaks out of its period of deflation. It has an aging and shrinking population and cumbersome regulations that make the economy inefficient.
As Mr. Abe has tried to put a new focus on reviving the economy, he has also fought with the central bank's former leaders over setting the 2 percent inflation goal. Mr. Abe's pressure in the end led to the resignation of the bank's previous governor, the moderate Masaaki Shirakawa. His departure led to the appointment of Mr. Kuroda, who shares Mr. Abe's economic philosophy.
Marc Chandler, global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York, said some in the market were speculating that the yen had been driven lower by non-Japanese investors. Those investors were anticipating that cash-rich Japanese investors were finally going to start selling their yen holdings to buy American and other foreign bonds in a hunt for higher yields outside Japan.
While the weaker yen is good for Japanese exporters, it makes imported products more expensive. That in turn can make selling foreign goods there harder.
In a statement, the American Automotive Policy Council reacted strongly to Thursday's milestone. "The depth of Japanese currency manipulation has reached a new low," said Matt Blunt, the council's president. He said the yen's weakening will cost American exports and jobs.
Still, there are concerns that too weak a currency could bring pain to a country dependent on imports for its energy and food. The Fukushima nuclear crisis, which has all but shut down Japan's nuclear power program, has already led to surging oil and gas imports and rising energy prices.
News shows have breathlessly covered recent price increases in items like tissue paper and canned tuna, perhaps a sign of the shock that prices should rise at all after more than a decade of deflation, rather than any immediate risk to household finances.
The key, economists say, is how much exporters and other corporations buoyed by the weaker yen will pass on their windfall to consumers, by hiring more workers and raising wages. Mr. Abe himself has been publicly pressuring corporate executives to raise pay, declaring on television last month that companies needed to "return favorable corporate earnings to their workers," prompting a string of companies to declare wage increases or extra bonuses in recent months.
"If wages can rise, then the return to inflation is good news," Nicholas Smith, Japan strategist at CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, said in a recent research note. "If wages are going to be flat or down, all we are going to see is stagflation."

Abstract: "Closing the foreign currency loophole in our sanctions policy is critical in our efforts to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapons capability," the sponsors, led by Senator Mark Steven Kirk, an Illinois Republican, and Senator Joe Manchin III, a West Virginia Democrat, said in a statement on the new legislation, which they called "the Iran Sanctions Loophole Elimination Act."

Full text:   Seeking to escalate pressure on Iran, a bipartisan group of senators introduced legislation on Wednesday that would deny the Iranian government access to its foreign exchange reserves parked in the banks of other countries, estimated to be worth as much as $100 billion, mostly in euros.
The legislation, which has strong support, would be the first major new sanction confronting Iran since its inconclusive round of negotiations with the big powers last month on its disputed nuclear program. Despite Iran's repeated denial, the West suspects it is aiming to be able to build nuclear weapons.
The United States and the European Union have enacted a broad range of economic sanctions aimed at pressuring Iran in those negotiations, but sponsors of the legislation contend that Iran is not bargaining in good faith while it continues to enrich uranium.
Part of the reason, they say, is that Iran has been able to work around the worst effects of the sanctions by tapping its foreign currency reserves overseas, which are largely beyond the reach of current restrictions.
"Closing the foreign currency loophole in our sanctions policy is critical in our efforts to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapons capability," the sponsors, led by Senator Mark Steven Kirk, an Illinois Republican, and Senator Joe Manchin III, a West Virginia Democrat, said in a statement on the new legislation, which they called "the Iran Sanctions Loophole Elimination Act."
It would impose severe penalties on any foreign financial institution that conducts foreign exchange transactions on behalf of Iran's central bank or other Iranian entity that is already blacklisted by other sanctions. It would also be retroactive to Thursday, regardless of the passage date.
Supporters of the legislation contended it sent a significant message of bipartisan resolve to Iran at a time when the efficacy of the sanctions strategy has been increasingly called into question, largely because it has not dissuaded Iran from continuing to enrich uranium.
"The strong support the bill enjoys from Senate Democrats demonstrates that Congress does not accept the argument advanced by some that pressure should be relieved," said Mark Dubowitz, the executive director of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington group that has advocated for more sanctions.
"It also demonstrates that the Obama administration understands that Iran cannot be allowed to exploit loopholes in international sanctions while it refuses to agree to a negotiated settlement over its nuclear program," he said.
Blocking Iran's access to billions of dollars' worth of its own money in foreign markets could cause significant complications for the country, where presidential elections are set for next month and the economy's troubles are a major issue.
Sanctions already in place have basically halved sales of oil, Iran's most important export, contributed to surging inflation, caused shortages of imports and sharply reduced the value of the national currency, the rial. Foreign exchange reserves are considered an important pillar in keeping the rial from collapse.
Critics said the new legislation risked further alienating Iranians who suspect that the sanctions' true purpose is not to pressure Iran in the nuclear negotiations, but to cause an economic implosion that would lead to regime change. Instead of forcing leaders to be more flexible on the issue, critics say, the legislation could harden their positions.
"When we've cemented a sanctions escalation path, we're creating a trajectory toward actual confrontation," said Trita Parsi, the founder of the National Iranian American Council, a Washington group that opposes sanctions. Some Iranian leaders, he said, see the sanctions "as a train that can only go in one direction and has no brakes."
Alireza Nader, an Iran specialist at the RAND Corporation, said the timing of the bill also could send the wrong signal to Iranian leaders, who he contended are already scrambling because of the sanctions imposed so far -- despite their projection of defiance.

Teacher Pay Hurt by Recession, Report Says

Abstract: According to the National Center for Education Statistics, average teacher salaries increased less than 1 percent, in inflation-adjusted terms, from 2000-12.

Full text:   During the recession and its aftermath, public schools took a hit as both state coffers and local property taxes shriveled. That showed up in shrinking employment, but also in teacher salaries.
According to a report being released Tuesday, the vast majority of teachers in the nation's largest school districts took a pay cut or saw their pay frozen at least one year between 2008 and 2012.
The report by the National Council on Teacher Quality, a nonprofit group that advocates for tougher teacher standards, looked at salary data across 41 of the country's 50 largest school districts. Average annual teacher pay increases, which included cost-of-living and contractually negotiated raises as well as increases awarded for extra years of experience, dropped from 3.6 percent in the 2008-09 school year to 1.3 percent in the 2011-12 year. (The report did not include increases that teachers may have received for extra degrees or certifications.)
Despite the downturn, some districts managed to give teachers larger pay increases. Chicago public schoolteachers, who went on strike last year, enjoyed the largest salary increases across the four-year period covered by the report, with an average 6.5 percent increase. Other districts that increased pay at higher-than-average rates during the recession and recovery period included Milwaukee, New York, Baltimore, Jefferson County in Kentucky and Fresno, Calif.
In Chicago, teachers received contractually negotiated raises of 4 percent in 2009, 2010 and 2011 as well as increases for extra years of experience. The school board voted to rescind the contractual raises in June 2011, one of several issues that triggered the strike.
"There is a coterie of people who believe that we do not deserve a raise," said Karen Lewis, president of the Chicago Teachers Union. She added, "It's not a matter of the hours we swipe in or swipe out, but the work that continues for us under increasingly difficult circumstances."
At the other end of the spectrum, pay for teachers in Albuquerque decreased from 2008-12 as the Legislature, which controls most school financing in New Mexico, did not appropriate funds for raises.
"It's a tough time being a public school employee," said Don Moya, chief financial officer of the Albuquerque Public Schools.
Across the country, teacher pay did not increase significantly over the last decade. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, average teacher salaries increased less than 1 percent, in inflation-adjusted terms, from 2000-12.
What's more, average teacher pay -- $56,643, according to the Department of Education -- is lower than the average pay in many other professions that require college and graduate degrees.
"I just see we're going down a road we cannot succeed in," said Dennis Van Roekel, president of the National Education Association.
Kate Walsh, president of the National Council on Teacher Quality, said districts should pay much higher salaries to fewer teachers.
"We think the profession needs to make more use out of really great classroom teachers," Ms. Walsh said, "and pay those teachers a whole lot more money."

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- One of the economic mysteries of the last few years has been the bigger-than-expected slowdown in health spending, a trend that promises to bolster wages and help close the wide federal deficit over the long term -- but only if it persists.
Major new studies from researchers at Harvard University, the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation and elsewhere have concurred that at least some of the slowdown is unrelated to the recession, and might persist as the economy recovers. David M. Cutler, the Harvard health economist and former Obama adviser, estimates that, given the dynamics of the slowdown, economists might be overestimating public health spending over the next decade by as much as $770 billion.
Between 2009 and 2011, total health spending grew at the lowest annual pace in the last five decades, at just 3.9 percent a year, although rising out-of-pocket costs have hit millions of families. In contrast, between 2000 and 2007, those annual growth figures ranged between 6.2 and 9.7 percent, according to government figures. Data from the Altarum Institute, a nonprofit research organization in Ann Arbor, Mich., suggests that the low pace of growth has continued through 2012 and early 2013.
The studies -- including some released Monday in the journal Health Affairs -- shed new light on the precise mix of factors that have led to the flattening-out.
Economists concur that the deep recession and sluggish recovery are the main reasons for slowing growth in spending. During the recession, millions of Americans lost their jobs, and thus their insurance coverage; millions more struggling families were reluctant to see a physician or undergo a procedure. But the slowdown in health costs proved steeper than forecast. It also occurred in populations whose health spending was mostly sheltered from the economic gyrations, like Medicare patients.
That led economists to surmise that other factors were at play. In new research, the Kaiser Family Foundation estimated that the recession accounted for about three-quarters of the lower spending trajectory, with the rest attributed to other factors not directly related to the economy. Professor Cutler of Harvard calculates that the recession accounted for about 37 percent.
Among other factors, the studies found that rising out-of-pocket payments had played a major role in the decline. The proportion of workers with employer-sponsored health insurance enrolled in a plan that required a deductible climbed to about three-quarters in 2012 from about half in 2006, the Kaiser Family Foundation has found. Moreover, those deductibles -- the amount a person needs to pay before insurance steps in to cover claims -- have risen sharply. That exposes workers to a larger share of their own health costs, and generally forces them to spend less.
Thus, while economists have cheered the flattening in health spending, families have assumed more and more of the health care burden: even if households benefit from the slower growth in health costs in the long term, they might suffer in the short term as their out-of-pocket health costs rise at a painful economic time to begin with.
"The slowdown in health costs is completely unreal to average people," said Drew Altman, the president of the Kaiser Family Foundation. "Experts measure aggregate spending. But people's costs have gone up 140 percent over the past 10 years, while wages only went up 40 percent."
In a new study in Health Affairs, Michael E. Chernew of the Harvard Medical School and his co-authors estimate that rising out-of-pocket payments, like deductibles and copays, account for about 20 percent of the decline in health spending.
Other major factors include lower Medicare payment rates, the less-rapid development of new medical treatments -- especially prescription drugs -- and changes in the way that insurers pay health care providers. Over the last decade, for instance, hundreds of hospitals and doctors have started to accept "bundled payments" for a course of treatment, rather than charging per procedure. Many health systems have also forged agreements with insurers to move away from fee-for-service medicine, instead writing contracts that compensate them for delivering less, but higher-quality care.
Policy makers in Washington consider that last change to be one of the most promising ones, though economists say they believe it is only just starting to show up in health spending statistics -- if at all. "For a few years, it was like what Bob Solow used to say about computers and productivity growth -- you could see it everywhere but in the numbers," said Professor Cutler of Harvard.
Forecasters generally expect the low pace of health cost growth to continue through 2013.
But come 2014, the significant expansion of insurance coverage through the Affordable Care Act will start to increase national health spending by hundreds of billions of dollars, although the underlying pace of inflation might remain low. Consolidation among medical providers also might start to push up the pace of cost growth, a more worrisome trend in the long term.
The economic recovery and falling unemployment should lead to higher spending, too. "Some return to higher spending is baked into a stronger economy," said Mr. Altman of the Kaiser Family Foundation. "That's going to be blamed on the A.C.A., and it shouldn't be."
But health economists are hopeful that the dozens of provisions in the Affordable Care Act designed to hold down costs might kick in as other factors fade. "My sense is that it's really gathering speed," Professor Cutler said of changes away from fee-for-service medicine. "Folks were taking tentative steps before the Supreme Court decision came down, but now everybody knows it's locked in and the governors are deciding about the Medicaid expansion. If you're a hospital executive, you're now saying: 'I need to figure out how I'm going to adjust to this.' "
Over the long term, a reduction in health inflation could be a boon for both families and the federal government. Policy makers consider rising health costs to be the biggest threat to the budget. Rising health costs have also eaten up more of workers' pay, contributing to the decline in real incomes over the last 15 years.

Abstract: According to the Labor Department, workers 25 to 34 years old are the only age group with lower average wages in early 2013 than in 2000. The United States, for example, has lost its once-large lead in producing college graduates, and education remains the most successful jobs strategy in a globalized, technology-heavy economy.

Full text:   WASHINGTON
THE idle young European, stranded without work by the Continent's dysfunction, is one of the global economy's stock characters. Yet it might be time to add another, even more common protagonist: the idle young American.
For all of Europe's troubles -- a left-right combination of sclerotic labor markets and austerity -- the United States has quietly surpassed much of Europe in the percentage of young adults without jobs. It's not just Europe, either. Over the last 12 years, the United States has gone from having the highest share of employed 25- to 34-year-olds among large, wealthy economies to having among the lowest.
The grim shift -- "a historic turnaround," says Robert A. Moffitt, a Johns Hopkins University economist -- stems from two underappreciated aspects of our long economic slump. First, it has exacted the harshest toll on the young -- even harsher than on people in their 50s and 60s, who have also suffered. And while the American economy has come back more robustly than some of its global rivals in terms of overall production, the recovery has been strangely light on new jobs, even after Friday's better-than-expected unemployment report. American companies are doing more with less.
"This still is a very big puzzle," said Lawrence F. Katz, a Harvard professor who was chief economist at the Labor Department during the Clinton administration. He called the severe downturn in jobs "the million-dollar question" for the economy.
Employers are particularly reluctant to add new workers -- and have been for much of the last 12 years. Layoffs have been subdued, with the exception of the worst months of the financial crisis, but so has the creation of jobs, and no one depends on new jobs as much as younger workers do. For them, the Great Recession grinds on.
For many people with jobs and nest eggs, the economy is finally moving in the right direction, albeit a long way from booming. Average wages are no longer trailing inflation. Stocks have soared since their 2009 nadir, and home prices are increasing again. But little of that helps younger adults trying to get a foothold in the economy. Many of them are on the outside of the recovery looking in.
The net worth of households headed by people 44 and younger has dropped more over the past decade than the net worth of middle-aged and elderly households, according to the Federal Reserve. According to the Labor Department, workers 25 to 34 years old are the only age group with lower average wages in early 2013 than in 2000.
The problems start with a lack of jobs. In 2011, the most recent year for which international comparisons exist, 26.2 percent of Americans between ages 25 and 34 were not working. That includes those for whom unemployment is a choice (those in graduate school, for example, or taking care of children) and those for whom it is not (the officially unemployed or those who are out of work and no longer looking). The share was 20.2 percent in Canada, 20.5 percent in Germany, 21 percent in Japan, 21.6 percent in Britain and 22 percent in France.
The European economy has deteriorated over the last two years, and the American economy has strengthened modestly. But the job growth here has been fast enough merely to keep pace with population growth, which suggests that this country still lags in the employment of young adults. In 2000, by contrast, the United States led Germany, Britain, France, Canada and Japan -- as well as Australia, Russia and Sweden -- in such employment rates. The nation now trails them all. Older American workers have also lost relative ground, but not as much.
As Mr. Katz, Mr. Moffitt and others note, an explanation of the root causes remains elusive. But there are obvious suspects, and each probably plays a role.
The United States, for example, has lost its once-large lead in producing college graduates, and education remains the most successful jobs strategy in a globalized, technology-heavy economy. It is no accident that the most educated places in the country, like Boston, Minneapolis, Washington and Austin, Tex., have high employment rates while the least educated, including many in the South and inland California, have low ones. The official unemployment rate for 25- to 34-year-old college graduates remains just 3.3 percent.
Beyond education, the nation has also been less aggressive than some others in using counseling and retraining to help the jobless find work. To take one small example, a recent study in France by the renowned M.I.T. economist Esther Duflo and four colleagues found that placement programs for unemployed workers helped not only the workers but the economy too. The counseled workers were more likely to find work, and they did not simply take jobs from other candidates. Overall employment rose more quickly in the regions with job counseling.
Other research notes that the United States has expanded parental leave and part-time work less than other countries -- and, perhaps relatedly, employment rates among women here have slipped.
Whatever role these trends are playing, they do not appear to fully explain the employment decline. It is too big and too widespread. Existing companies are not adding jobs at the same rate they once did, and new companies are not forming as quickly.
What might help? Easing the parts of the regulatory thicket without societal benefits. Providing public financing for the sorts of early-stage scientific research and physical infrastructure that the private sector often finds unprofitable. Long term, nothing is likely to matter more than improving educational attainment, from preschool through college (which may have started already).
Many business executives and economists also point to immigration policy. Done right, an overhaul could make a difference, many say, by allowing more highly skilled immigrants to enter the country and by making life easier for those immigrants already here. Historically, immigrants have started more than their share of new companies.
Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of the jobs slump is that the Americans in their 20s and 30s who have been most affected by it remain decidedly upbeat. They are much more hopeful than older generations, polls show, that the country's future will be better than its past.
Based on what younger adults have been through, that resilience is impressive. It's probably necessary, too. The jobs slump will not end without a large dose of optimism.

Full text:   IT'S a ho-hum economy, at best. Four years after the end of the Great Recession, gross domestic product appears to be growing at a lackluster pace, labor productivity is lagging and, despite a slight improvement last month, the unemployment rate is still a painfully high 7.5 percent.
Yet in the financial markets, it's a much happier world. An epic rally in stocks has been roaring ahead, with the Dow Jones industrial average on Friday briefly surpassing 15,000 for the first time.
Thanks to the intervention of the Federal Reserve, the bond market remains improbably strong, too. The benchmark 10-year Treasury rate fell as low as 1.612 percent last week, driving prices, which move in the opposite direction, to stratospheric levels. That helped Apple sell $17 billion of bonds at yields once reserved for the sovereign debt of only the safest governments.
In short, it's been a giddy time to be an investor. But while the financial markets are soaring, the real economy appears to be mired in an endless slog. That discrepancy raises a troubling question: How long can financial portfolios continue to swell if wages, employment and corporate revenue remain constrained?
Unfortunately, there is no clear answer.
"The beauty of economics is that we are still arguing about the causes of the start and the end of the Great Depression," said James W. Paulsen, the chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis. "We'll be debating these questions for the rest of our lives."
Economists and market strategists have plenty of opinions, however, and Mr. Paulsen, who takes a glass-half-full perspective on the current situation, is no exception.
He says the stock market rally can continue so long as the economy keeps growing at what he prefers to call a "modest" pace, rather than a disappointing one. Despite evidence to the contrary -- most crucially, stubbornly high unemployment -- he maintains that the recovery is actually quite good under the circumstances. And, he said, it's robust enough for American corporations to churn out solid profits that will bolster stock returns.
That provides no comfort for people who are out of work or earning inadequate wages, he said, but it may reassure investors and be useful for public policy.
Why? Mr. Paulsen has been arguing for years that the annual rate of economic growth is likely to remain in the low single digits because of a long-term demographic shift: the aging of the American population. The working-age population has been expanding less rapidly, at an annualized rate of 1.1 percent from 1986 to 2012, down from 1.7 percent from 1960 to 1985.
Mr. Paulsen favors liberalizing immigration rules, which would reverse this trend and spur more robust growth, he said. Until that happens, he said, "it's possible that 4 percent annual growth is all we are going to get, and we should be happy with it."
In the first quarter of this year, the annualized G.D.P. growth rate was only 2.5 percent, he points out, but it would have been 4 percent if the effects of government budget cuts had been excluded. Government austerity is a drag on the economy now, he said, but is likely to become less severe at some point, when a longer-term solution replaces the draconian budget sequestration.
Whatever the reason for less-than-stellar economic growth, American companies have been reaping handsome profits. And corporate America's ability to preserve its profit margins has been a linchpin of the market rally, said David J. Kostin, the chief United States equity strategist at Goldman Sachs.
An important metric, recurring profit margin, has plateaued near 9 percent, according to his calculations, and as long as it continues at that level, it should be enough to propel the market upward. Last week was the heart of earnings season for American companies. More than 80 percent of the companies in the S.& P. 500 have reported results for the first quarter and, by and large, they fared well, he said.
"The stock market is trading at fair value today, and I think it can continue to climb higher in line with earnings growth," he said.
Goldman projects that the American economy will grow at a rate of 2 percent this year, he said. In the quarter, sales reported so far at S.& P. 500 companies -- which include revenue from faster-growing markets like China's -- were virtually flat, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. But profits grew 5.7 percent. "We aren't seeing an extraordinary level of economic growth," he said, "so companies need to take other measures to enhance profits."
ONE thing that companies are doing is "being very careful about costs and about hiring," he said, which helps explain the anemic labor market. And by borrowing at low rates, businesses can use the money for productive purposes or to engage in financial engineering.
They can buy back shares -- thus increasing earnings per share -- or increase dividends or both, which is what Apple plans to do with its borrowed billions. (Apple is keeping a cash hoard of more than $100 billion overseas, at least partly to avoid incurring a tax liability in the United States.)
Low interest rates will be with us a good while longer, Fed policy makers reiterated last week. They said they'd keep rates low as long as inflation was subdued and unemployment stayed high. In fact, they suggested that they might even add stimulus -- increasing their $85 billion a month in bond purchases -- if economic conditions worsen.
"For the stock market the Federal Reserve is the big wild card," said Ed Clissold, United States market strategist at Ned Davis Research in Venice, Fla. "As long as the Fed and the other central banks keep pumping liquidity into the economy, our base case is that the cyclical bull market in stocks can continue."
But Mr. Clissold said the lack of meaningful sales growth for S.& P. 500 companies concerned him. Weak sales could presage a drop in profit margins, he said. And if profit margins decline sharply -- by about 10 percent or so -- history suggests that it's time to say goodbye to the bull market. And that's the least of it.
A sharp drop in sales and profit margins might also be an early indicator of an outright recession. That would bring untold pain to many people, not just stock investors.
For now, though, while he is scrutinizing the numbers closely, they appear to be benign.
It may not be a great economy, but the financial markets are partying on.

Full text:   Washington may be hitting the brakes, but the private sector is still rolling ahead, helping create nearly 200,000 jobs a month, on average, since the beginning of the year and forcing the overall unemployment rate in April down to its lowest level since the end of 2008.
This push-and-pull dynamic was evident in data released Friday by the Labor Department, as private employers added 176,000 people to their payrolls even as the public sector shed an additional 11,000 workers.
The latest figures painted a somewhat brighter picture of the overall economy than had been expected as the government sharply revised upward its estimate for job creation in the previous two months. Those revisions concluded that the economy generated a robust 332,000 jobs in February, not the 268,000 originally reported, and 138,000 in March, up from 88,000.
The news sent the stock market soaring to new highs, with major stock market indexes closing up 1 percent for the day.
Still, at 7.5 percent, a slight drop from last month's 7.6 percent, the jobless rate remains far higher than it typically would be this far into a recovery. It is also a full percentage point above the level the Federal Reserve has said it wants to see before it will consider raising interest rates from their current levels near zero.
As a result, most experts expect the economy to continue to be buffeted by countervailing factors in the months ahead, with business activity and the Fed providing a healthy measure of support for growth even as fiscal austerity in Washington makes a substantial drop in the unemployment rate unlikely.
"The drag from the government sector is quite substantial," said Gregory Daco, senior principal economist at IHS Global Insight. "Given the fiscal headwinds, the private sector is doing O.K."
Despite repeated fears of a double-dip recession, an economy that has endured a spring swoon for three consecutive years and other potential perils, the country's rate of job creation has been remarkably steady, if subdued. Over the last three years, the economy has added an average of 162,000 jobs a month, within a hairbreadth of April's pace, at least as initially estimated, of 165,000 new jobs.
But experts have been warning that the economy and job creation are likely to slow in the second quarter, largely as a result of fiscal tightening in Washington. Payroll taxes increased in January, and the effect of across-the-board spending cuts mandated by Congress is expected to be felt more broadly in the months ahead.
While the private sector has been on the upswing since last summer, cutbacks in government employment continue to prevent a stronger acceleration in the economy, economists said.
"If it weren't for the government, the economy would be stronger," said Mr. Daco, citing the spending cuts hitting now, as well as the higher Social Security deductions for all workers and increased income taxes for top earners that began in January.
On the other hand, he said, "If the Fed hadn't loosened monetary policy, we'd be seeing weaker growth. Both sides are generating opposing forces."
Even though job growth now looks better, continued strains in the economy and data this week showing inflation over the last 12 months running at a low 1 percent rate suggest that the Fed is not likely to slow its $85 billion in monthly bond purchases intended to stimulate the economy for at least the next few months. On Wednesday, the Fed said it was "prepared to increase or reduce the pace of its purchases," depending on the outlook for the labor market and inflation.
The White House was quick to highlight Friday's report, even as it warned of the potential dangers from the fiscal squeeze.
"While more work remains to be done, today's employment report provides further evidence that the U.S. economy is continuing to recover from the worst downturn since the Great Depression," Alan Krueger, chairman of President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, said in a statement. Mr. Krueger urged Congress to replace automatic budget cuts with a more balanced approach. "Now is not the time for Washington to impose self-inflicted wounds on the economy," he said.
Republicans cautioned against drawing too positive a conclusion from April's data. "President Obama's desperate hype-and-blame campaign will try to spin today's anemic jobs report six ways to Sunday," Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, said in a statement. "But the facts remain clear: too many Americans have been unemployed for far too long. For millions, the economy is simply not working."
The jobs report provided plenty of fodder for differing views. On the positive side, the size of the labor force increased, while the total number of unemployed Americans dropped by 83,000 to 11,659,000. What's more, the ranks of the long-term unemployed, defined as workers who have been out of a job for 27 weeks or more, declined especially sharply, falling by 258,000 to 4.4 million. That is still far above what is typical at this stage of a recovery, but it is a marked improvement from past months. The long-term unemployed have been a particular cause of concern for economists in this recovery, because skills degrade the longer a person is out of the work force, and employers are reluctant to hire someone who has not held a job in a while.
On the downside, the least-educated workers continue to bear the brunt of elevated joblessness, with the unemployment rate for workers who failed to graduate from high school rising to 11.6 percent from 11.1 percent in March. At the other end of the education spectrum, unemployment among people with a college degree or more remained at a low level, rising by 0.1 of a percentage point to 3.9 percent.
Employment in the construction sector, which increased at a healthy pace in the first three months of 2013, actually dipped by 6,000 in April. The recovering housing market has been one of the bright spots in the economic landscape, and economists will be closely watching to see if higher home prices and increased construction translate into additional jobs. The manufacturing sector, which is closely watched as a gauge of broader economic strength, was unchanged in April.
Analysts noted that the number of hours worked fell in April, another sign that the economy is having trouble generating enough additional income and jobs to help lift spending. The typical workweek fell to 34.4 hours from 34.6 in March. Average hourly earnings inched up 4 cents to $23.87.
The economy has been showing other signs of weakness of late. Several indicators beginning in March have pointed to much slower growth, with everything from retail sales to manufacturing looking soft recently.
"In one line: Not bad, especially in the light of beaten-down expectations," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist with Pantheon Macroeconomic Advisors, after Friday's report. "This could have been much worse."

Full text:   Is college worth it? Given the growing price tag and the frequent anecdotes about jobless graduates stuck in their parents' basements, many have started to question the value of a college degree. But the evidence suggests college graduates have suffered through the recession and lackluster recovery with remarkable resilience.
The unemployment rate for college graduates in April was a mere 3.9 percent, compared with 7.5 percent for the work force as a whole, according to a Labor Department report released Friday. Even when the jobless rate for college graduates was at its very worst in this business cycle, in November 2010, it was still just 5.1 percent. That is close to the jobless rate the rest of the work force experiences when the economy is good.
Among all segments of workers sorted by educational attainment, college graduates are the only group that has more people employed today than when the recession started.
The number of college-educated workers with jobs has risen by 9.1 percent since the beginning of the recession. Those with a high school diploma and no further education are practically a mirror image, with employment down 9 percent on net. For workers without even a high school diploma, employment levels have fallen 14.1 percent.
But just because college graduates have jobs does not mean they all have "good" jobs.
There is ample evidence that employers are hiring college-educated workers for jobs that do not actually require college-level skills -- positions like receptionists, file clerks, waitresses, car rental agents and so on.
"High-skilled people can take the jobs of middle-skilled people, and middle-skilled people can take jobs of low-skilled people," said Justin Wolfers, a professor of public policy and economics at the University of Michigan. "And low-skilled people are out of luck."
In some cases, employers are specifically requiring four-year degrees for jobs that previously did not need them, since companies realize that in a relatively poor job market college graduates will be willing to take whatever they can find.
That has left those who have spent some time in college but have not received a bachelor's degree to scramble for what is left. Employment for them fell during the recession and is now back to exactly where it began. There were 34,992,000 workers with some college employed in December 2007, and there are 34,992,000 today.
In other words, workers with four-year degrees have gobbled up all of the net job gains. In fact, there are more employed college graduates today than employed high school graduates and high school dropouts put together.
It is worth noting, too, that even young college graduates are finding jobs, based on the most recent data on this subgroup. In 2011, the unemployment rate for people in their 20s with at least a bachelor's degree was 5.7 percent. For those with only a high school diploma or a G.E.D., it was nearly three times as high, at 16.2 percent.
Americans have gotten the message that college pays off in the job market. College degrees are much more common today than they were in the past. In April, about 32 percent of the civilian, noninstitutional population over 25 -- that is, the group of people who are not inmates of penal and mental facilities or residents of homes for the disabled or aged and who are not on active military duty -- had a college degree.
Twenty years ago, the share was 22 percent. Given the changing norms for what degree of educational training is expected of working Americans, employers might assume those who do not have a four-year degree are less ambitious or less capable, regardless of their actual ability.
These forces might help explain why there is so much growth in employment among college graduates despite the fact that the bulk of the jobs created in the last few years have been low-wage and low-skilled, according to a report last August from the National Employment Law Project, a liberal research and advocacy group. Today nearly one in 13 jobs is in food services, for example, a record share.
Clearly, positions in retail and food services are not the best use of the hard-earned skills of college-educated workers, who have gone to great expense to obtain their sheepskins. Student loan borrowers graduate with an average debt of $27,000, a total that is likely to grow in the future.
But nearly all of those graduates are at least finding work and income of some kind, unlike a much larger share of their less educated peers. And as the economy improves, college graduates will be better situated to find promotions to jobs that do use their more advanced skills and that pay better wages, economists say.
The median weekly earnings of college-educated, full-time workers -- like those for their counterparts with less education -- have dipped in recent years. In 2012, the weekly median was $1,141, compared with $1,163 in 2007, after adjusting for inflation. The premium they earn for having that college degree is still high, though.
In 2012, the typical full-time worker with a bachelor's degree earned 79 percent more than a similar full-time worker with no more than a high school diploma. For comparison, 20 years earlier the premium was 73 percent, and 30 years earlier it was 48 percent.
And since a higher percentage of college graduates than high school graduates are employed in full-time work, these figures actually understate the increase in the total earnings premium from college completion, said Gary Burtless, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, an independent research organization.
So, despite the painful upfront cost, the return on investment on a college degree remains high. An analysis from the Hamilton Project at the Brookings Institution in Washington estimated that the benefits of a four-year college degree were equivalent to an investment that returns 15.2 percent a year, even after factoring in the earnings students forgo while in school.
"This is more than double the average return to stock market investments since 1950," the report said, "and more than five times the returns to corporate bonds, gold, long-term government bonds, or homeownership."

Full text:   I'm scheduled to deliver the commencement address Friday at my alma mater, Grambling State University in Louisiana, so I've been giving quite a bit of thought to the America into which these students are graduating.
I must admit that finding hopeful, encouraging things to say has been exceedingly difficult, in part because the landscape at the moment -- particularly for young adults -- is so bleak.
Here are some of the facts that I'm up against rhetorically and that these students will be up against more literally.
1. Being a college graduate is becoming less exceptional. As the Pew Research Center pointed out in November, "Record shares of young adults are completing high school, going to college and finishing college." College graduation rates are growing even more in other countries. And Anya Kamenetz noted in The Atlantic magazine in December, "During the past three decades, the United States has slipped from first among nations to 10th in the percentage of people holding a college degree, even as the job market has eroded for Americans without one."
2. Graduates are emerging with staggering amounts of debt and entering a still-sluggish job market. This is causing them to delay major life decisions, like marriage or buying a home or even moving out of their parents' home.
A Pew report from February 2012 found that:
"Since 2010, the share of young adults ages 18 to 24 currently employed (54 percent) has been its lowest since the government began collecting these data in 1948. And the gap in employment between the young and all working-age adults -- roughly 15 percentage points -- is the widest in recorded history. In addition, young adults employed full time have experienced a greater drop in weekly earnings (down 6 percent) than any other age group over the past four years."
3. Emerging markets, like China and India, have become major competitors for exportable jobs.
4. Income inequality between top earners and the rest of America has risen. And the recovery since the Great Recession has essentially been a recovery of the rich. A recent study by Emmanuel Saez, a professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley, found that:
"From 2009 to 2011, average real income per family grew modestly by 1.7 percent but the gains were very uneven. Top 1 percent incomes grew by 11.2 percent while bottom 99 percent incomes shrunk by 0.4 percent. Hence, the top 1 percent captured 121 percent of the income gains in the first two years of the recovery."
This was similar to a finding by the Pew Research Center last month:
"During the first two years of the nation's economic recovery, the mean net worth of households in the upper 7 percent of the wealth distribution rose by an estimated 28 percent, while the mean net worth of households in the lower 93 percent dropped by 4 percent."
5. At the same time, the cost of basic goods has soared. For example, when I graduated from college the average price of a gallon of gas was about $1 (adjusted for inflation, that would still be less than $2), and it's currently nearing $4. Some people now have to make desperate choices: a tank of gas, a bag of groceries or a bottle of medicine.
6. Our politics have become polarized to the point of paralysis. A Pew poll last June found that Americans' "values and basic beliefs are more polarized along partisan lines than at any point in the past 25 years."
What gives me hope is that despite this dire environment, young people remain more optimistic than anyone else. Some of that may simply be the intrinsic glow of youth, but I believe that with this generation, something more is afoot.
This is a generation of people who have come of age in an era of overlapping traumas -- terrorism and wars and recession. They have also come of age in changing times, and are more tolerant and less punitive in their social view. They see this country, and the world, differently than we older folks do. Theirs is an America waiting to be made better, not one that is simply, and irreversibly, getting worse.
According to a CNN/ORC poll released last month, young adults (those 18 to 34) were the most likely to think that things were going well in this country.
I plan to tap into that optimism on Friday, and I hope to reflect some of it back at those beaming faces under square hats.
Dear college graduates, this is your moment and your America. Both need your vision and demand your efforts. Keep your head up and your hopes rising. Congratulations and good luck. You'll need it, and I'll be rooting for you. (Flip tassels.)

Abstract: [...]a growing number of economists believe that our very high levels of inequality are not just whacking the incomes of the "have-nots" but are slowing job growth as well. [...]financial deregulation has become the enemy of full employment: it funnels capital to unproductive parts of the economy, and plays a key role in the "shampoo cycle" of bubble, bust, repeat.

Full text:   WASHINGTON
THOUGH yesterday's employment report revealed a slowly improving job market, the jobless rate is still elevated, at 7.5 percent, with 11.7 million people looking for work, including 4.4 million who have been doing so for at least half a year. About eight million more were stuck in underemployment ("involuntary" part-timers) last month, unable to find the hours of work they sought.
These measures persist amid an economic expansion continuing since mid-2009, a roaring stock market and a housing market that's now reliably in recovery.
While the high jobless numbers are partly a legacy of the Great Recession, the fact is that our economy has generated too few jobs for most of the last 30 years and is likely to continue to do so. The only viable response is a return to an idea that once animated domestic policy making: full employment, the notion that everyone who wants to work should be able to find a job, and if the market isn't up to the task, then the government must fill the gap.
For decades in postwar America, the maintenance of full employment, defined as an unemployment rate below 5 percent, was enshrined in law, beginning with the Employment Act of 1946 and revisited in 1978 in the Humphrey-Hawkins Act. It was a central goal of the Democratic Party, labor unions and advocates of social and racial justice.
And it usually worked. While conservatives and businesses pushed back -- tight labor markets meant more worker bargaining power, higher wages and less profitability -- between 1949 and 1979 the market was at full employment over two-thirds of the time. Since then, it has been at that level just a third of the time.
How did this happen? Both the politics and economics are implicated.
Politically, as union power declined, the concerns of Democratic policy makers shifted from working-class issues like jobs and toward the concerns of upper-income constituents, like inflation, taxes and budget balancing.
Economically, a number of trends have created persistent, upward pressure on the jobless rate. Since 2000 -- the last time the market was at full employment -- productivity is up about 30 percent, while employment has been flat. And that's not just because of the recession; the same pattern prevailed during the 2000s expansion.
One explanation may be that capital investment has become, to put it politely, more "labor saving." Yes, this process has been going on forever, but robotics and other ways of automating tasks may be accelerating it.
Second, our large and persistent trade deficits have exported too much demand. There's nothing wrong, and a lot right, with increased global trade. The problem comes when it stays out of balance for so long, as it has in America, with trade deficits averaging 5 percent of G.D.P. in the 2000s, compared with 1 percent in the 1990s. That's millions of net jobs lost.
Third, a growing number of economists believe that our very high levels of inequality are not just whacking the incomes of the "have-nots" but are slowing job growth as well. Part of this works through the demand channel: with so much spending power in the hands of so few, consumer demand is becoming bifurcated. Walmart will do well on one end, Neiman Marcus on the other, with too little in between. Another part works through misallocation: too much economic activity devoted to "innovative" finance and too little to sectors more germane to middle-class jobs and incomes.
What would it take to reverse these trends? For one thing, in the near term, do no harm. Austerity, including sequestration, is the economic version of medieval leeching. The Federal Reserve continues to apply high doses of monetary stimulus, and that's supporting low interest rates, which in turn are linked to the improving housing market. But it can't do it alone, and Congress is counteracting such tailwinds with fiscal headwinds.
We also need a significant, permanent program to absorb excess labor (an explicit part of the Humphrey-Hawkins law). We should consider restarting and rescaling a subsidized jobs program from the 2009 Recovery Act that, though relatively small, made jobs possible for hundreds of thousands of workers.
And we have to reassess our manufacturing policy, including reducing the trade deficit. That means both reshaping our dollar policy -- going after competitors who suppress their currencies' value to get an edge on net exports -- and public investments in areas where clean energy intersects with production.
Finally, financial deregulation has become the enemy of full employment: it funnels capital to unproductive parts of the economy, and plays a key role in the "shampoo cycle" of bubble, bust, repeat. Less volatile capital markets mean fewer shocks to the job market.
If that is too interventionist, there's another approach. Like many European countries, we could ask less of our people in terms of work, and hold them harmless by broadly redistributing our productivity gains. But I don't see that in our future. What I do see is a growing disconnection between growth and jobs. Setting a path to full employment is the best way to alter that dark vision.

Full text:   Ever since the financial crisis struck, and the Federal Reserve began "printing money" in an attempt to contain the damage, there have been dire warnings about inflation -- and not just from the Ron Paul/Glenn Beck types.
Thus, in 2009, the influential conservative monetary economist Allan Meltzer warned that we would soon become "inflation nation." In 2010, the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development urged the Fed to raise interest rates to head off inflation risks (even though its own models showed no such risk). In 2011, Representative Paul Ryan, then the newly installed chairman of the House Budget Committee, raked Ben Bernanke, the Fed chairman, over the coals, warning of looming inflation and intoning solemnly that it was a terrible thing to "debase" the dollar.
And now, sure enough, the Fed really is worried about inflation. You see, it's getting too low.
Before I get to the trouble with low inflation, however, let's talk about what we should have learned so far.
It's not hard to see where inflation fears were coming from. In its efforts to prop up the economy, the Fed has bought more than $2 trillion of stuff -- private debts, housing agency debts, government bonds. It has paid for these purchases by crediting funds to the reserves of private banks, which isn't exactly printing money, but is close enough for government work. Here comes hyperinflation!
Or, actually, not. From the beginning, it was or at least should have been obvious that the financial crisis had plunged us into a "liquidity trap," a situation in which many people figure that they might just as well sit on cash. America spent most of the 1930s in a liquidity trap; Japan has been in one since the mid-1990s. And we're in one now.
Economists who had studied such traps -- a group that included Ben Bernanke and, well, me -- knew that some of the usual rules of economics are in abeyance as long as the trap lasts. Budget deficits, for example, don't drive up interest rates; printing money isn't inflationary; slashing government spending has really destructive effects on incomes and employment.
The usual suspects dismissed all this analysis; it was "liquidity claptrap," declared Alan Reynolds of the Cato Institute. But that was four years ago, and the liquidity trappers seem to have been right, after all.
And it's worth mentioning another issue on which the inflation non-worriers have been vindicated: how to measure inflation trends. The Fed relies on a measure that excludes food and energy prices, which fluctuate widely from month to month. Many commentators ridiculed this focus on "core" inflation, especially in early 2011, when rising food and energy prices briefly sent "headline" inflation above 4 percent even as the core stayed low. But, sure enough, inflation came back down.
So all those inflation fears were wrong, and those who fanned those fears proved, in case you were wondering, that their economic doctrine is completely wrong -- not that any of them will ever admit such a thing.
And, at this point, inflation -- at barely above 1 percent by the Fed's favored measure -- is dangerously low.
Why is low inflation a problem? One answer is that it discourages borrowing and spending and encourages sitting on cash. Since our biggest economic problem is an overall lack of demand, falling inflation makes that problem worse.
Low inflation also makes it harder to pay down debt, worsening the private-sector debt troubles that are a main reason overall demand is too low.
So why is inflation falling? The answer is the economy's persistent weakness, which keeps workers from bargaining for higher wages and forces many businesses to cut prices. And if you think about it for a minute, you realize that this is a vicious circle, in which a weak economy leads to too-low inflation, which perpetuates the economy's weakness.
And this brings us to a broader point: the utter folly of not acting to boost the economy, now.
Whenever anyone talks about the need for more stimulus, monetary and fiscal, to reduce unemployment, the response from people who imagine themselves wise is always that we should focus on the long run, not on short-run fixes. The truth, however, is that by failing to deal with our short-run mess, we're turning it into a long-run, chronic economic malaise.
I wrote recently about how, by allowing long-term unemployment to persist, we're creating a permanent class of unemployed Americans. The problem of too-low inflation is very different in detail, but similar in its implications: here, too, by letting short-run economic problems fester we're setting ourselves up for a long-run, perhaps permanent, pattern of economic failure.
The point is that we are failing miserably in responding to our economic challenge -- and we will be paying for that failure for many years to come.

Full text:   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia -- The European Central Bank cut its benchmark interest rate to a record low on Thursday. But its president, Mario Draghi, indicated that his promise last year to do "whatever it takes" to save the euro had limits.
For now, at least, the bank remains unwilling or unable to wield the more powerful weapons that many economists say are needed to jolt the Continent out of recession. Although the big fear last year that the euro zone might break apart has receded, the danger now could be prolonged stagnation like that which has plagued Japan for most of the last two decades.
Even the traditionally conservative Bank of Japan has become bolder lately, aggressively buying government bonds to try to double the supply of money in circulation and spur growth. Such a step would be unthinkable for Mr. Draghi, who is hemmed in by the bank's narrower mandate and the historically rooted inflation fears of Germany, the euro zone's wealthiest and most politically powerful member.
The bank's Governing Council, meeting in Bratislava, reduced its benchmark interest rate to 0.5 percent from 0.75 percent. But that move was widely seen as mostly symbolic, to avoid the impression that the bank and Mr. Draghi were doing nothing as the euro zone recession threatens to engulf countries, like Germany, that have previously been spared.
The central bank also extended its promise to provide banks with as much cheap cash as they need through 2014, and said it was exploring ways to use the European Union's house bank to stimulate lending to small businesses.
Intriguingly, Mr. Draghi raised the possibility of imposing a "negative rate" on the deposits that banks routinely park at the central bank, essentially charging banks to store their money. That might discourage lenders from hoarding cash rather than lending. But it could have unintended consequences. For example, banks might store huge amounts of paper bills as a low-risk alternative to central bank vaults.
Mr. Draghi insisted that the rate cut, which takes effect May 8, would stimulate growth, especially now that the economic slump that has afflicted Spain and Italy for more than a year is spreading north to countries like Germany, Austria and Finland. Anticipating skepticism, he urged reporters "not to underestimate the impact" of the rate cut and other measures at his news conference on Thursday, under a crystal chandelier in an ornate building that houses the Slovak Philharmonic. It was one of the central bank's twice-a-year meetings in the capital of one of its member countries.
Not only is the central bank avoiding Japanese-style shock therapy, but it remains far from pursuing any equivalent of the so-called quantitative easing that the United States Federal Reserve Board and the Bank of England have used to stimulate their economies.
"The bright minds in the Eurotower are still working hard to come up with a new magic bullet," Carsten Brzeski, an economist at ING Bank, said in a note to clients, referring to the central bank's headquarters in Frankfurt. "In the meantime, the only thing Draghi found in his tool kit was an old tool and a chill pill to keep markets happy in the waiting room."
Under the euro zone's political structure as a loose confederation, the European Central Bank does not have the monolithic power of the Fed, Bank of England or Bank of Japan. Even if Mr. Draghi and some others on the 23-member Governing Council wanted to do more to spur growth, they are hamstrung by a charter that obliges the bank to defend price stability above all else and forbids it from providing financing to governments.
Mr. Draghi has at times been willing to stretch that mandate. Last summer, for example, he promised to buy government bonds in unlimited amounts to control borrowing costs. His expression of resolve has been enough to keep speculators at bay and tamp down the interest rates on Spanish and Italian debt, without any actual bond purchases.
Mr. Draghi also must contend with the politics of the central bank's Governing Council, which includes the heads of all 17 national central banks in the euro zone. Germany, in particular, remains staunchly opposed to bond buying or other aggressive measures to stimulate growth, for fear of inflation.
"There are 17 governors of 17 member states with completely opposing views," said Zsolt Darvas, a research fellow at Bruegel, a research organization in Brussels. "There are major disagreements." The need to promote consensus breeds caution, he said.
Mr. Darvas also noted that the European Union lacked a central treasury that would stand ready to provide financial backup if central bank investments went wrong, as the United States Treasury implicitly backs the Fed. "That probably makes the E.C.B. more reluctant to take risks," Mr. Darvas said.
Mr. Draghi promised on Thursday to continue letting banks borrow as much as they wanted at the benchmark rate for "as long as needed," and at least until mid-2014. That was a longer time commitment than the E.C.B. has offered in the past.
Bank loans are still readily available in the northern countries, so it is easier for an official rate cut to reach borrowers. In the latest sign of trouble in Europe's core, two stalwarts of corporate Germany, BMW and Siemens, warned on Thursday of lower profits for 2013 because of the weakness in European markets.
While acknowledging that the slowdown was spreading to Germany, Mr. Draghi listed several indicators that he said signaled that the euro zone was healing, including big gains in the Italian and Spanish stock markets and lower market interest rates on their government bonds. Some economists argue that the central bank can do little to force-feed credit to small businesses in countries like Greece and Portugal that are having prolonged downturns. Banks' reluctance to lend reflects the fact that many businesses and consumers are poor credit risks.
The rate cut, Mr. Draghi said, "is going to be more effective today than it would have been a few months ago."
Even at its new low of 0.5 percent, though, the central bank benchmark rate remains higher than the 0.25 percent rate the Federal Reserve has had in place since late 2008.
In another disturbing parallel to Japan, inflation in the euro zone was just 1.2 percent in April, well below the European Central Bank's target of about 2 percent. Mr. Draghi gave no indication Thursday that the bank was worried that the euro zone was edging toward deflation, the growth-sapping decline in wages and prices that vexed Japan. But a few analysts have begun to warn of the danger of such a price spiral, which could be more destructive than runaway inflation because it is so difficult to reverse.

Full text:   JAKARTA, Indonesia -- The fruit and vegetables that slowly gather flies in the morning heat at the Bendungan Hilir market in central Jakarta include both imported and Indonesian produce, but according to local sellers, origin does not matter: Everything is expensive.
Indonesians are accustomed to the pain of rising food prices in a country where about 100 million people live on $2 a day or less. But both patrons and vendors at the market think things will get worse: The low fuel prices they count on, kept among the cheapest in the world by aggressive subsidies, may soon skyrocket, too.
The national government has announced it wants to increase the price of gasoline, because state subsidies that keep it well below the international market rate are burning a hole in the budget.
The country's Finance Ministry says spending on fuel subsidies could reach $23 billion in 2013, compared with about $20 billion last year. Total subsidies for electricity and fuel could end up costing about $32 billion, or 20 percent of the 2013 budget. The Indonesian government's statistics show that it spends more on fuel subsidies annually than it does on social programs and capital expenditures combined.
On Tuesday, PresidentSusilo Bambang Yudhoyonosaid he would submit a revised 2013 budget to the House of Representatives in May that would include a fuel price increase, but would also revive a cash compensation program for poor families to cushion the blow.
"Usually when the price of gasoline goes up, all other prices go up," said Therasa Natalia, 22, who runs a noodle stall in the market. "It pushes up transportation costs, and everything from food to clothes is higher. Even if it's only private cars paying more, everything will go up. It's always like that."
Last month, Mr. Yudhoyono's government floated the idea of a two-tier gasoline pricing plan meant to shield Indonesia's poor and lower classes from higher costs.
People who drive motorcycles and public transportation vehicles would continue to pay 4,500 rupiah per liter, or about $1.74 per gallon, while owners of private vehicle and commercial vehicles like delivery trucks and company cars would pay 6,000 rupiah, a 33 percent increase.
However, cabinet ministers and aides to Mr. Yudhoyono said this week that under the new plan, fuel prices would probably increase for everyone to 6,500 rupiah per liter. On Wednesday, tens of thousands of people from labor unions and groups representing women, students and environmentalists protested that proposal during street marches to observe Labor Day.
Although Indonesia has a plenty of oil production fields and is among the top 25 oil-producing nations in the world, it is a net importer of petroleum. Gasoline is so heavily subsidized that at the end of 2012, the country had the lowest fuel prices of any net oil-consuming nation in the world, according to the World Bank. The second-lowest was the United States, where a gallon sold for $3.29 on Dec. 31 -- nearly twice as much as in Indonesia.
The Indonesian Finance Ministry has estimated that the country will exceed the 2013 budget quota of 46 trillion liters, or 12 trillion gallons, of subsidized fuel by at least 15 percent or more. Savings from eliminating or reducing a fuel subsidy could go to crucial public social programs including health care, as well as much-needed infrastructure investment, according to analysts.
Ms. Natalia said she would be willing to endure higher gasoline prices -- and the accompanying increases in the prices of food, clothing and other items -- if the government would spend every penny of the money it saved on social and national development programs.
But even then, she had doubts. Ms. Natalia predicted that unscrupulous traders would start hoarding staple foods like rice before a fuel price increase to drive prices up even further, perhaps setting off a crime wave in Jakarta.
"It's the ordinary people who are victimized," she said.
Fuel subsidies are a highly political and emotional issue in Indonesia. Some of the unrest that led to the ouster of the authoritarian PresidentSuharto, who died in 2008, was rooted in fuel prices.
Mr. Yudhoyono drew theatrical, albeit minor, protests when he raised gasoline prices in 2005 and 2008, mainly because he gave poorer Indonesians cash handouts to ease the blow. But he then lowered fuel prices before his landslide re-election in 2009, while keeping the handouts in effect, angering his political rivals.
In March 2012, Mr. Yudhoyono proposed raising fuel prices again, but even members of his own governing coalition revolted to embarrass him, quashing his plan at a raucous House of Representatives session as student and labor groups outside clashed with riot police officers on live national television.
Mr. Yudhoyono was twice elected to office on a platform sympathetic to the country's poor, and even with national elections scheduled for 2014 and his governing Democratic Party lagging in the polls, he has few viable alternatives but to raise gasoline prices in some fashion, according to analysts.
Indonesian law prevents Mr. Yudhoyono's government from running a budget deficit higher than 3 percent, and the Finance Ministry estimates that raising gasoline prices would keep the deficit below the legal threshold.
"It's better than nothing," said Ndiame Diop, lead economist at the World Bank in Jakarta. "It sends the signal that the government is doing something."
However, Mr. Diop said any incremental price increase should be viewed as a stopgap measure. The Indonesian private sector, the World Bank and others have long appealed to the Indonesian government to get rid of subsidies altogether, mainly because studies have shown that the country's rich benefit from them far more than its poor do.
Still, Mr. Diop said, an increase in the price of a liter of gasoline to make it even fractionally closer to the international market level would have to be accompanied by the same compensation program for the poor that Mr. Yudhoyono's government had in 2005 and 2008, which was viewed as effective.
"Our key point is compensation -- the need to compensate the poor from the spike in inflation following a fuel subsidy reform," he said.
About 29 million Indonesians live below the country's national poverty line -- 250,000 rupiah per person per month or 1,250,000 rupiah per family per month, and in urban areas, 350,000 rupiah per person per month or 1,500,000 rupiah per family per month. A further 70 million, categorized as near poor, live just above that line. Didik Rachbini, a prominent economist and member of Mr. Yudhoyono's National Economic Council, which comprises economists and leading businessmen and advises the president on economic policy, said the government had a longstanding fear that increasing the price of fuel would push tens of millions of near-poor Indonesians below the poverty line.
"If we increase fuel prices for everyone, the price of 15 to 20 basic goods will also increase, such as rice," he said. "It would reduce the purchasing power of the poor."
Indonesia has one of the world's strongest emerging-market economies, with growth of better than 6 percent for the past three years. It also has a higher rate of foreign direct investment as a percentage of gross domestic product, at 2.75 percent, than countries like Brazil (2.69 percent), India (1.4 percent) or China (1.36 percent), according to BBVA Research in Hong Kong.
Despite the country's economic boom, Mr. Rachbini said, income among Indonesia's poor and near poor rose 2 percent in 2012, compared with a nationwide average of 4.8 percent and between 7 percent and 8 percent for more affluent Indonesians.
Hence, Mr. Rachbini said, quasi- socialist policies like low-cost gasoline are needed to maintain stability, given Indonesia's high levels of poverty.
"Our budget policy is almost like a socialist country," Mr. Rachbini said, jokingly. "It's like Venezuela. But in my view, it brings the stability that gives a chance for foreign investment to come and for us to build our economy."
Yet Mr. Yudhoyono must balance Indonesia's status as a hot investment destination against deficits in its budget and its current account balance, a measure of foreign trade and investment, which have political, social and even security consequences. He has repeatedly wavered -- and has been accused of being weak -- on reducing fuel subsidies since being re-elected in 2009 and is highly sensitive to street demonstrations like those on Wednesday, according to analysts.
Mr. Yudhoyono again hedged his bets Tuesday by throwing the political hot potato back into the House, saying fuel prices would be raised "when the poverty funding is ready" from lawmakers when they debate his 2013 budget revision. Some lawmakers were on record last month as being against cash compensation because it could give Mr. Yudhoyono's Democratic Party a lift before the legislative elections next year.
Average Indonesians are anxiously considering their budget and transportation options.
Kamela, a 55-year-old homemaker who shops regularly at the Bendungan Hilir market, said she would have to stop driving her Toyota Yaris and take public buses if the government raised the price of gasoline by even 1,500 rupiah.
"I can't just switch to a motorcycle, because I am scared to drive on the streets -- it's dangerous," she said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text:   LOS ANGELES -- For "Star Trek Into Darkness," the coming $190 million movie from J. J. Abrams, the mission is to boldly go where no Star Trek film has gone before -- and get audiences overseas to care.
"Star Trek" may be one of the biggest franchises in Hollywood history, but it has one surprising flaw: Captain Kirk doesn't travel well. Foreign moviegoers for one reason or another have never fully embraced the swaggering Starfleet captain and his oddball crew. That is a major problem for Paramount Pictures now that international ticket sales account for up to 80 percent of a movie's total gross.
A 2009 effort to revive the Star Trek movie series was a smash hit in North America, taking in about $280 million, after adjusting for inflation. But box-office analysts were deeply disappointed by the film's foreign box office total of $139 million.
So Paramount has revved up its engines to warp speed for "Into Darkness," which is already playing in some countries and will arrive in the United States on May 17. The Viacom-owned studio has increased its international marketing budget for the film by 35 percent over that for the 2009 film, asked stars to do an unusual amount of globetrotting and staggered the release dates to shield "Into Darkness" from competition.
Paramount's bid to draw in more foreign ticket buyers even extended to casting decisions and the script, which turns on a more terrestrial story. "Into Darkness" finds the Enterprise crew called back home, where a terror force has infiltrated the Starfleet organization.
"The team has really been in the weeds, so to speak, going country by country and looking at every possible opportunity," Brad Grey, Paramount's chairman, said of the studio's marketers in particular. "On a profit level, focusing on your shareholders, this is now how detailed you have to be on pictures of this scope and scale."
Mr. Grey added, "Between J. J. outdoing himself and our efforts to build up our global distribution system, I'm very, very confident that the franchise is finally going to live up to its potential." In 2009, "Star Trek" may have been a disappointment outside North America, but it also represented enormous progress. The preceding film in the franchise, "Star Trek: Nemesis" in 2002, took in a grand total of $31 million overseas.
But Paramount and its financing and producing partner, Skydance Productions, are counting on "Into Darkness" to do much better -- perhaps delivering a 100 percent increase over the 2009 movie's overseas gross. The studio has little room for error. Hollywood's major studios will release as many as eight movies each over the summer, but Paramount will issue only two: "Into Darkness" and the risky "World War Z," an intense zombie thriller starring Brad Pitt.
Pure science fiction has long been a difficult sell overseas, where audiences generally prefer space movies that have more fantasy elements, like "Star Wars." The Star Trek movies, at least until Mr. Abrams came along to direct the 2009 version, also lacked eye-popping visual effects, leaning more on makeup tricks and drama on the bridge of the Enterprise.
Six "Star Trek" television shows, all notable for their kitsch, have been dubbed and distributed overseas, creating a solid (albeit older) fan base. But the TV show also hurts Paramount's big-screen efforts, adding to a perception that the franchise is an impenetrable universe of characters and story lines.
The 2009 film, which featured a young cast but no proven stars, was in some ways torpedoed by Paramount's own distribution decisions. Four other big releases -- "X-Men Origins: Wolverine," "Angels & Demons," "Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian" and "Terminator Salvation" -- all opened in the same period, giving "Star Trek" little time to find its way.
This time, Paramount has decided on a staggered rollout, releasing "Into Darkness" in Australia, Germany, Britain and Mexico before the United States and Canada, and holding the movie back elsewhere. It will not arrive in Japan until August, for instance. Unlike the 2009 chapter, "Into Darkness" is planned for distribution in China. All told, Paramount will stage red carpet premieres in seven countries.
Cast members and producers have been crisscrossing the globe for months as part of advance marketing efforts. Chris Pine, who plays Capt. James Kirk, was dispatched to Tokyo in December to unveil a nine-minute trailer. More recently, Bryan Burk, an "Into Darkness" producer, went on an 11-city foreign tour -- South America, Asia, Europe -- to show 35 minutes of the movie, almost a third of it, to journalists and exhibitors.
Paramount went out of its way to cast foreign actors, in particular adding the British star Benedict Cumberbatch as the villain. And writers tried to produce a self-contained plot that would be exciting to loyal Star Trek fans but not put off people who know nothing about the franchise, which now includes 12 movies. (Research showed that foreign ticket buyers viewed the 2009 film as "too Trekkie and too sci-fi," in the words of one Paramount executive.)
"Classically people think that it's a space film, but this one is a very earthbound story," Mr. Pine recently said at a convention for theater owners.
Judging by advance excerpts Paramount has shown, the studio has added some superhero touches; Mr. Pine, for instance, dons a space suit and zooms through an asteroid field in a sequence that resembles an "Iron Man" moment.
The "Iron Man" movies, as Paramount knows, having distributed the first two, are enormously popular overseas.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve said Wednesday that its economic stimulus campaign would press forward at the same pace it has maintained since December, putting to rest for now any suggestion that it was leaning toward doing less.
The Fed emphasized that it was ready to increase or decrease its efforts to spur growth and reduce unemployment as necessary, a more balanced position than it took earlier in the year, reflecting the reality that a strong winter has once again yielded to a disappointing spring.
It was the first time that the Fed had explicitly mentioned the possibility of doing more in a policy statement, although officials, including the Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, have made the point repeatedly in public remarks.
Analysts disagreed about the central bank's intent. Some saw it as a signal that the Fed's next move could be an expansion of its stimulus.
Others, however, said the Fed was simply underscoring that it did not plan to reduce its asset purchases. It is buying $85 billion a month in Treasury and mortgage-backed securities.
"I don't think there's much chance of them stepping it up," said Jim O'Sullivan, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics in New York. "But this is certainly their way of saying there's no bias toward scaling down."
The Fed maintained a relatively sunny economic outlook in its statement, released after a two-day meeting of its policy-making committee. It said that the economy was expanding at a "moderate pace" and that the labor market had shown "some improvement." It added, however, that federal spending cuts were "restraining economic growth," an implicit critique of the rest of the government.
That language was stronger than the Fed had used in previous assessments of the economic impact of fiscal policy. Fed officials have repeatedly expressed frustration that fiscal policy is working at cross-purposes with their own monetary policy. The statement also noted that the pace of inflation had slackened, a potential sign of economic weakness. Bringing the annual rate of inflation closer to its target of 2 percent has been a primary goal of the Fed's four-year-old stimulus campaign, but the statement expressed little concern about the recent deceleration to a pace of only about half that level.
Investors and the Fed have taken the view that inflation is likely to return to a more normal pace without additional effort.
"The committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic growth will proceed at a moderate pace and the unemployment rate will gradually decline" to a level the Fed regards as acceptable, the statement said.
Michael Feroli, chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase, said the stability of the Fed's economic outlook suggested that policy, too, would remain stable.
"In effect, the Fed signaled that the pace of asset purchases would be data dependent in both directions, but that right now the data gives them little reason to change in either direction," Mr. Feroli wrote Wednesday in a note to clients.
The statement won support from 11 of the Federal Open Market Committee's 12 members. Esther George, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, cast the dissenting vote, as she has at each meeting this year, citing concerns about potential "economic and financial imbalances" and the risk of excessive inflation.
The pace of economic growth appeared to slow in the weeks between the Fed's previous meeting and the one this week. Inflation slackened in March to the slowest pace in two years, while employers added the fewest jobs in any month since last summer. And economists say that the pain of federal spending cuts is just beginning to tell.
Inflation was 1.1 percent during the 12 months ending in March, according to the most recent data from the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the Commerce Department's index of personal consumption expenditures. That is well below the 2 percent annual pace that the Fed considers healthy.
The share of Americans with jobs has not increased since the recession.
The central bank is modestly expanding its stimulus campaign each month, as it increases the size of its bond portfolio. The Fed's most recent economic projections, published in March, showed most officials expected persistently low inflation and persistently high unemployment for years to come.
Officials, however, are reluctant to do more. They see modest benefits and uncertain costs in buying more bonds. The volume of the Fed's first-quarter purchases already roughly equaled the volume of new mortgage bond issuance and about 72 percent of the volume of new issuance of long-term federal debt.
And the Fed already has tied the duration of low interest rates to the unemployment rate, announcing in December that it intended to hold its benchmark short-term interest rate near zero at least as long as the unemployment rate remained above 6.5 percent, provided that inflation remained under control.
An official account of the Fed's previous meeting, in March, showed that officials discussed reducing the monthly volume of bond purchases. Some officials who supported the purchase program when it began last year said they saw evidence that the economy was growing more quickly, and that the Fed might be able to curtail the volume of its asset purchases by the third quarter.
An account of this week's meeting will be released in three weeks, providing a comparable look at the latest round of internal debate. But analysts said that the changed language in the statement reflected a shift in that debate.
The statement said, "The committee is prepared to increase or reduce the pace of its purchases to maintain appropriate policy accommodation as the outlook for the labor market or inflation changes." The Fed's previous statement said it would adjust the level of purchases based on economic conditions.
Michael Gapen, director of United States economic research at Barclays Capital, wrote in a note to clients that the statement was "a fairly obvious nod to some of the recent softness in economic activity, labor markets and inflation." He said it reinforced his view that the Fed would maintain its $85 billion pace through the end of the year.
The Fed also could increase the impact of its campaign by telling investors how long it will run -- either in terms of a date or an economic target. But officials say that it has been impossible to reach a consensus on that issue.

Full text:   The euro zone jobless rate rose to a record 12.1 percent in March, a sharp reminder that unemployment remains among the region's biggest problems.
The unemployment rate in the 17-nation currency union ticked up by one-tenth of a percentage point from February, when the previous record was set, Eurostat, the statistical agency of the European Union, reported from Luxembourg. A year earlier, the rate was 11 percent.
A separate report Tuesday from Eurostat showed that inflation dropped sharply, well below the European Central Bank's target rate of 2 percent a year. The annualized rate of inflation for consumer prices was 1.2 percent in April 2013, down from March, when it was 1.7 percent.
The reports, along with other recent data that suggested that the economy was healing more slowly than many had hoped, could prompt the European Central Bank to take action at its policy meeting on Thursday. The central bank could cut its key interest-rate target, already at a record low of 0.75 percent, by a quarter point, economists said, though the impact of such a move would probably be slight because banks remain less than eager to lend.
"Stabilizing the peripheral euro zone countries will take at least until the end of 2013," said Ralph Solveen, an economist with Commerzbank in Frankfurt. As a result, he said unemployment would probably keep rising "until next spring."
For the 27-nation European Union, the jobless rate was unchanged in March, at 10.9 percent. Eurostat estimated that 26.5 million men and women were unemployed in Europe, including 5.7 million young people.
Jobless figures for both the euro zone and the European Union are the highest Eurostat has reported since it began keeping the data in 1995, in the days before the euro. In comparison, the unemployment rate in the United States was 7.6 percent in March.
The European economy remains trapped in a torpor with little relief in sight. Governments have tightened public finances to meet deficit targets, and companies remain reticent about hiring. The euro zone's gross domestic product is widely expected to decline for a second consecutive year in 2013.
Manufacturers are largely dependent on demand from outside Europe for growth. Carmakers, which employ about two million people in Europe, anticipate that sales in the European Union will this year fall back to levels last seen in the early 1990s.
A decline in energy prices helped push the inflation rate lower, but Jennifer McKeown, an economist in London with Capital Economics, said that the jobless problem was probably itself part of the reason for the downward pressure on prices.
She said in a note that it would be "a disappointment" if the central bank failed to ease rates and "announce further unconventional policies to boost bank lending."
Two nations are staggering under depression-level jobless rates: Greece, where the European sovereign debt crisis began, had a rate of 27.2 percent in January, the latest month for which data were available; and Spain, which had unemployment of 26.7 percent in March.
Portugal was next at 17.5 percent. Germany, which has the largest economy in the European Union, was at 5.4 percent, with only Austria, at 4.7 percent, lower. Britain's rate was 7.8 percent, while France's was 11 percent.

Chinese Way of Doing Business: In Cash We Trust, Exclusively

Abstract: Since 1988, the 100-renminbi note, graced by Mao Zedong's visage, has been the largest note in circulation, even though the economy has grown fiftyfold.

Full text:   SHANGHAI -- Lin Lu remembers the day last December when a Chinese businessman showed up at the car dealership he works for in north China and paid for a new BMW 5 Series Gran Turismo -- entirely in cash.
"He drove here with two friends in a beat-up Honda," Mr. Lin recalled. "One of his friends carried about $60,000 in a big white bag, and the buyer had the rest in a heavy black backpack."
Lugging nearly $130,000 in cash into a dealership might sound bizarre, but it's not exactly uncommon in China, where hotel bills, jewelry purchases and even the lecture fees for visiting scholars are routinely settled with thick wads of renminbi, China's currency.
This is a country, after all, where home buyers make down payments with trunks filled with cash. And big-city law firms have been known to hire armored cars to deliver the cash needed to pay monthly salaries.
For all China's modern trappings -- the new superhighways, high-speed rail networks and soaring skyscrapers -- analysts say this country still prefers to pay for things the old-fashioned way, with ledgers, bill-counting machines and cold, hard cash.
Many experts say it is not a refusal to enter the 21st century as much as wariness, of the government toward its citizens and vice versa.
Doing business in China takes a lot of cash because Chinese authorities refuse to print any bill larger than the 100-renminbi note. That's equivalent to $16. Since 1988, the 100-renminbi note, graced by Mao Zedong's visage, has been the largest note in circulation, even though the economy has grown fiftyfold. (The country's national icon, Chairman Mao, appears on nearly every note: the 1-, 5-, 10-, 20, 50- and 100- renminbi note.)
Chinese economists and government officials often suggest that printing larger denomination notes might fuel inflation. But there is another reason.
"I'm convinced the government doesn't want a larger bill because of corruption," said Nicholas R. Lardy, a leading authority on the Chinese economy at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, noting that it would help facilitate corrupt payments to officials. "Instead of trunks filled with cash bribes you'd have people using envelopes. And there'd be more cash leaving the country."
All the buying, bribing and hoarding forces China to print a lot of paper money. China, which a millennium ago was the first government to print paper money, accounts for about 40 percent of all global paper currency output, according to a report published by the China Banknote Printing and Minting Corporation. Adjusting for the size of its economy, China has about five times as much cash in circulation as the United States.
In the United States, the highest denomination printed is $100; in Japan, it is the 10,000-yen note, worth about $100; the 500 is the highest-denomination euro note, worth about $650. No major economy has limited itself to such a low denominated bill as China.
By making the 100-renminbi note the largest bill, the nation's citizens need more of it to buy a television or Swiss watch, never mind a car, home or a yacht, which China's state-run media said was bought a few years ago by men bearing two suitcases filled with cash.
Following those paper bills as they course through this booming economy offers a fascinating glimpse into how China's financial system works, and how parts of the country remain stuck in yesteryear.
"In large parts of China, it still looks like the U.S. in the 1950s: most everything is in cash," said Jeffrey R. Williams, executive director of the Harvard Center Shanghai and a former bank executive who has worked in China for more than 30 years. "In the U.S., you might have one bill-counting machine at a bank, but here every teller has one."
Although China's coastal cities have flourished during the 30 years of economic prosperity, economists say the country's interior remains poor and disconnected from the more modern aspects of the financial grid. As a result, the poor prefer to do business in cash.
The rich also like to deal in cash, and they typically hide their money in the underground economy to avoid government scrutiny of their wealth. As was the case in other developing economies of Asia, easily traceable credit cards and checks are not commonly used.
"The average Chinese trusts neither the Chinese banks nor the Communist Party," said Friedrich Schneider, an authority on shadow economies around the world and a professor of economics at the Johannes Kepler University of Linz in Austria. "This is simply a mistrust of government. And so lots of people deal only in cash."
That lack of trust fosters a cat-and-mouse game between the government and its subjects, analysts say. Executives make secret cash deals to earn outside consulting fees while working at state-run companies. The government responds by trying to penetrate a vast underground economy, where off-the-books transactions are conducted almost entirely in cash, because it is harder for the authorities to trace and tax.
Often, the culprits are the very government officials who are supposed to be upholding the laws.
Take the case of Wen Qiang, the former police chief in the city of Chongqing. He was caught in 2009 with nearly a million dollars in renminbi, carefully wrapped in plastic bags and hidden in a water tank at a relative's home.
In another case, the brother of China's former railway minister was caught hiding about $5 million worth of renminbi at his home, some of it stored so poorly that the mildewed bills broke one government bill-counting machine.
To keep a lid on the illegal cash transfers, China restricts cross-border money transfers and places limits on foreign currency exchange.
Understandably, printing all that money is a major endeavor. The China Banknote Printing and Minting Corporation runs 80 production lines with 30,000 workers, six bank note companies, two paper mills, a printmaking company, a plate-making corporation and a firm that produces special anticounterfeiting security lines.
The People's Bank of China, which oversees the operation, declined to comment on what the government calls the "name cards of the Republic."
Perhaps those paper bills should come with a warning about storage practices. Last month, a migrant worker in Shanghai discovered that mice had chewed into tiny pieces the $1,200 his wife stored in a closet.
A local bank agreed to exchange the money if the man could reassemble at least three-quarters of a bill.
"But the bills are now in small pieces and it's almost impossible to fix them," said Zhao Zhiyong, the 37-year-old worker. "Who could know that the money would be chewed by mice?"

Full text:   State financing for preschool fell by more than $548 million, or close to 10 percent, in the 2011-12 school year, the largest annual drop in a decade, according to a report released Monday.
"The State of Preschool," released by the National Institute for Early Education Research at Rutgers University, also showed that enrollment in state-financed preschool has stagnated at about 28 percent of 4-year-olds and 4 percent of 3-year-olds.
The decline in financing worked out to about $400 per child. Of the 40 states that offer state-subsidized preschool, 27 states reduced per-child funds in 2011-12. The overall financing figures were adjusted for inflation.
W. Steven Barnett, director of the institute and lead author of the report, described the preschool situation as "a state of emergency."
The report, which has been released annually since 2002, came a few weeks after President Obama outlined a plan to finance preschool for all 4-year-olds from low- or moderate-income families. The plan, which would cost $66 billion over 10 years, would be paid for by raising federal cigarette taxes to $1.95 from $1.01 per pack.
At a news conference in Washington to unveil the report, Arne Duncan, the secretary of education, said children from low-income families start kindergarten an average of 12 to 14 months behind their wealthier peers in language development and pre-reading skills. "That is morally and educationally unacceptable," he said. "And from a long-term economic competitiveness standpoint, it is just plain dumb."
Over the decade, state financing per child has fallen more than $1,100 since 2001-02, though overall financing increased 48 percent over the same period. Michael J. Petrilli, executive vice president at the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, an education policy group, said the figures reflected an expansion in enrollment.
"This is a policy choice we're making," Mr. Petrilli said, "which is to spread the money around to lots of kids instead of targeting it on the neediest kids."
The report noted that quality standards for preschool programs had slipped over the past year. Out of the 40 states that provide state--financed preschool, only four states and one program in Louisiana met 10 benchmarks set by the institute.
Given that research showing long-term benefits of early education come from studies of high quality programs, Kris Perry, executive director of the First Five Years Fund, an advocate of early education for disadvantaged children, said she was particularly concerned. "We really should not be tolerating publicly subsidized care that is not quality," she said.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve is making modest progress in its push to reduce the unemployment rate. But that is not the jobs goal Congress actually established for the Fed. The central bank is supposed to be maximizing employment. And on that front, it is not making progress.
The share of American adults with jobs has hovered around 58.5 percent for more than three years, roughly five percentage points below its prerecession peak.
Job creation has merely kept pace with population growth. The unemployment rate, now 7.6 percent, has fallen mostly because people stopped looking for work.
There is little sign, however, that Fed officials are considering an expansion of their four-year-old stimulus campaign as the Fed's policy-making committee prepares to convene Tuesday and Wednesday in Washington.
"We are seeing an impact from our policies," Eric S. Rosengren, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston president, said in a recent interview. But "I think we're pushing the interest-sensitive sector about as far as we're going to be able to push it at this time."
Fed officials backed away from talk of an early retreat from the current program of asset purchases -- $85 billion a month in Treasury and mortgage-backed securities -- after economic growth and inflation both rose more slowly than expected in the first quarter.
The Fed's preferred inflation gauge rose 1.2 percent, below its 2 percent target. But that is as far as the pendulum has swung.
The Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, and his allies point to increased sales of homes and autos and the rising stock market as evidence that the asset purchases are working. "After reviewing the efficacy and costs of this program, I have concluded that the efficacy has been as high or higher than I expected at the onset of the program and the costs the same or lower," William C. Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said in a recent speech.
But there are several reasons officials remain reluctant to do more. The benefits of additional asset purchases appear modest, at best. The consequences of buying more bonds are uncertain. And officials are frustrated that their monetary policy is being forced to play a role that most economists and Fed officials say could be more easily and effectively performed by fiscal policy.
Another reason the Fed is not embracing new measures is that it already has tied the duration of low interest rates to the unemployment rate. The Fed said in December that it intended to hold interest rates near zero at least as long as the unemployment rate remained above 6.5 percent, provided that inflation remained under control. The theory is that the economy will get as much stimulus as it needs.
"Communications from Fed leadership cast some doubt on the appetite of the key policy makers for increasing the monthly flow of purchases," Michael Feroli, chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase, wrote in an analysis of the coming meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee. "If the F.O.M.C. were to increase total purchases, they would prefer to do so by lengthening the time period over which they purchase $85 billion per month, rather than by increasing the monthly pace of those purchases."
The Fed has good reasons for focusing on the unemployment rate. Historically, as people looking for jobs find work, people sitting at home start looking, so that total employment increases as the unemployment rate declines.
But recent research by two Fed economists suggests the current plan will not work if the Fed begins to reduce its efforts when unemployment falls below 6.5 percent, because that is not low enough to draw people into the job market.
The economists, Christopher J. Erceg and Andrew T. Levin, both on leave at the International Monetary Fund, calculated that the number of people who wanted jobs but were not looking now exceeded the number actively searching.
"It's safe to ignore the participation rate during normal times," Mr. Levin said earlier this month at a conference held by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, where the paper was presented. "Our message is that it may not be safe to ignore it now."
They argued that the Fed should continue its stimulus campaign until those people were drawn back into the job market, and were able to find jobs -- in other words, that the Fed should focus on employment rather than unemployment.
The implication is that the Fed should hold interest rates near zero even after the unemployment rate returns to a more normal level and even if inflation starts to rise.
Some Fed officials are skeptical of such arguments. James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, warned in a presentation earlier this month that the Fed should not increase its efforts to reduce unemployment if the price is higher inflation.
"Such an approach may be highly counterproductive," he said, citing economic simulations that yielded better outcomes when the Fed maintained its focus on stabilizing the annual rate of inflation at about 2 percent.
Fed officials raise other doubts. Narayana Kocherlakota, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, said in a recent interview that economists understood the relationship between the unemployment rate and inflation, allowing for careful calibration of Fed policy. By contrast, he noted, it would be more difficult to set a target for labor force participation because of demographic changes, like the growing share of retirees.
Still, Mr. Kocherlakota said, the 6.5 percent unemployment threshold is too high. He wants to reduce it to 5.5 percent.
Other officials say that they, too, might favor more accommodation if declines in the unemployment rate are not matched by a rising employment rate.
"We do not want to get to 6.5 percent just by having people pull out of the labor force," Mr. Rosengren of the Boston Fed said. "We want to get to 6.5 because employment is expanding and we're adding jobs faster than labor force growth."

Full text:   On its face, Friday's announcement that the nation's gross domestic product expanded at a 2.5 percent annual rate in the first quarter was good news, following as it did an only marginally positive result for the previous three-month period.
But, alas, that rosy headline figure masked disturbing signs: an economy whose recovery has failed to match the pace of past expansions may now be facing a deceleration in its own modest growth rate.Start with the G.D.P. figures, which can be misleading because of temporary fluctuations in the inventories maintained by businesses. Adjusted for those changes, the economy's annualized growth rate shows a steady deceleration over the past three quarters, from 2.4 percent to 1.9 percent to 1.5 percent.
That's on top of a highly disappointing employment report for March, when only 88,000 new jobs were created, compared with an average of 197,000 for the previous six months.
And other economic measures -- ranging from retail sales to the index of leading economic indicators -- have begun to display softness and even declines. All told, at a minimum, we have entered yet another spring slowdown.
Perhaps it will prove transitory, as the pauses of the past three years have been. But worrisome signs suggest that this time may, indeed, be different.
For one thing, hourly wages, after adjustment for inflation, haven't budged in more than three years. That's unusual during an ostensible period of recovery, particularly from such a vicious recession.
Without higher incomes, consumers can't expand their purchases (at least not without dipping into their savings).
Meanwhile, Washington's budget wars have thus far produced a fistful of undesirable policy changes. Instead of thoughtful reforms -- particularly to programs like Medicare and Social Security -- to begin to bring the nation's long-term debt under control, Congress has adopted a series of meat-ax measures.
While that has shrunk the federal deficit significantly -- this year, the deficit is likely to come in at around $775 billion, compared with $1.1 trillion in the previous year -- the sudden contraction is likely to slow the economy further, cutting the growth in America's economic output this year by about 1.5 percentage points. Using basic yardsticks, that measures out to 1.5 million fewer jobs.
Finally, the weak world economy has knocked one American strategy for ratcheting up growth -- faster increases in exports -- badly off the rails. Just three years ago, United States exports were expanding at a 27 percent annual rate; today they are barely growing, and sales to Europe's hard-hit economies are declining.
To be sure, unlike Europe, where countries have faced double-dip recessions (and, in some cases, the prospect of a triple-dip), the United States is highly unlikely to experience a similar fate.
Our economy still exhibits some signs of strength, like the gathering recovery in housing construction and home prices. That has been aided by a strong stock market, which has rebuilt the value of retirement accounts and other investments.
But without rising incomes (and with mortgage financing still constrained), Americans' ability to buy new homes will remain limited.
Meanwhile, the stock market recovery has been built on the shaky pilings of higher corporate profitability that has resulted far more from cutting costs than from growing revenues. That's not sustainable.
The challenges listed above, of course, would be substantial by themselves.
But the most worrisome aspect of our current economic doldrums is that we can't expect any of the factors weighing on it to be self-correcting. For example, the lack of wage growth owes much to the continuing effects of globalization, a trend that has benefited the United States as a whole while hurting many workers.
Nor are the prospects bright for renewed expansion in Europe, or for a resumption of the meteoric growth rates we once saw in emerging market nations, particularly in China.
Were Washington functional, policy makers could significantly ameliorate these effects. First and foremost, Congress could adopt budget policies that would accomplish more thoughtful, more gradual -- and yet, ultimately, more substantial -- deficit reduction.
Instead of deep, across-the-board cuts in many important investment programs, ranging from infrastructure to research and development, we need to protect those initiatives while adjusting our social welfare programs to live within our means and protect the truly needy.
To address the effects of globalization, so much more can be done in education and training to prepare workers for the skilled jobs that play better to America's strengths.
Congress would be doing the American people a service if it came together to tackle these more consequential questions, and not just the problem of air-traffic delays.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Abstract: Since the recession ended in mid-2009, quarterly growth has averaged around 2 percent.

Full text:   At first glance, the latest economic growth report, released Friday, appears to show the economy revving up. In reality, the economy is either stuck in low gear, or worse, slowing to a stop as budget cuts harm not only the users of overstretched government services but the overall economy. This precarious situation urgently calls for more federal spending, not less, though that message has been lost on Congress.
From January through March, the economy grew at a modest annual rate of 2.5 percent, compared with a measly 0.4 percent in the last three months of 2012. That seems like a big jump, but it was less than economists expected and does not alter the big picture. Since the recession ended in mid-2009, quarterly growth has averaged around 2 percent. Every acceleration from that pace has inevitably petered out, which is why unemployment is high and pay is low nearly four years into what is officially an economic recovery.
Worse, there are signs in the latest report of a renewed slowdown. Excluding inventories, which tend to artificially depress growth in some quarters and raise it in others, growth in the first quarter of 2013 was only 1.5 percent, compared with 1.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2012 and 2.4 percent in the third quarter.
Underneath it all is the fiscal drag from ill-advised and ill-timed austerity measures. With the expiration this year of the payroll tax break, personal income declined sharply last quarter, forcing consumers to draw on their savings to support their spending. That is unsustainable, presaging weaker consumption in the months to come and, with it, weaker overall growth.
At the same time, cutbacks in government spending took a big chunk out of growth, reflecting, in part, the onset of automatic budget cuts under the sequester. The hit from lower public spending will only intensify in the quarters to come as the sequester takes full effect, threatening to push growth below its already paltry 2 percent average.
There is a tendency, in the gloom, to look for bright spots. Housing, for example, showed continued growth in the first quarter, but it was more than offset by the drag from cuts in government spending. If overall growth remains sluggish or even slows down, that could overwhelm the housing recovery, because the pace of home sales is inseparable from the pace of the economy. Without enough growth to power jobs and pay, potential homeowners will simply not have the income and credit profiles to buy.
Lack of demand is also bound to take an increasing toll on corporate earnings, which also have been a bright spot. Already, some prominent companies, including I.B.M. and Caterpillar, have reported disappointing results, a reflection of waning demand not only in the United States but in recessionary Europe and in China, where growth has been below expectations. The longer and more widespread the weakness is, the less faith investors will have in the ability of the Federal Reserve to engineer a rebound. The real danger in the Fed's efforts to revive the economy is not that its actions will cause inflation -- of which there is no evidence -- but that they will fail to revive the economy by any meaningful measure, denting investor confidence and, in the process, the stock market.
That is not to blame the Fed. For years, Congress and the Obama administration have been working at cross-purposes to the Fed, as strategies to cut the budget have taken priority over strategies to increase growth, jobs and pay. Republicans have insisted on austerity for ideological and political reasons. The administration has done better by adding new taxes and investments to the cuts, but the reductions are still deep and damaging. The budget fights have endured even as the intellectual arguments for near-term deficit reduction have collapsed. They have endured even as the economies that have enforced budget cuts most strenuously have contracted, notably in Britain and in much of the rest of Europe. And they endure even as the United States remains impaired by fiscal wounds that are, unfortunately and undeniably, self-inflicted.

Abstract: Having just filed tax returns, many people may not want to think about how the changes to the tax code under the American Taxpayer Relief Act, passed in early January, could affect them. In California, a will alone is not enough to avoid the state's getting involved in the probate process, said Andy Katzenstein, a partner in the personal planning department at Proskauer, a law firm.

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDEDWITH the federal tax on estates now kicking in at $5.25 million -- or $10.5 million for a couple -- it may seem that only the very wealthy need to worry about paying the tax. But that doesn't mean that everyone else can forget about an estate plan.
Consider the people who fill out forms designating who inherits assets like an insurance policy and then never go back and revise the forms when, for instance, they divorce and remarry. And then, there are the parents who have not determined who will serve as guardians for their children.
"Even though you have less than $10 million or even if you have more, you really want to guide the family as best you can," said Stuart Kessler, a certified public accountant and director at the accounting firm CohnReznick.
Having just filed tax returns, many people may not want to think about how the changes to the tax code under the American Taxpayer Relief Act, passed in early January, could affect them.
But if they don't, they may be shocked come next year's tax season. Or worse they may end up making financial plans based on a cursory understanding of what the changes mean for them and regret it later.
Over the next couple of weeks, I am going to look at how the tax changes could sway people's thinking on estate planning, investments and insurance and why people need to think clearly about how they are responding.
This week, I'm looking at estate planning, where the focus over the last decade has been on the exemption amount and the tax rate above it. The exemption rose steadily and the tax rate fell from 2001 until 2010, when the estate tax disappeared for most of that year. When the tax returned in 2011 and 2012, the exemption was set at a historically generous $5 million indexed for inflation and a 35 percent rate above that.
The American Taxpayer Relief Act made the exemption permanent at the 2011 level, indexed for inflation, and set the tax for anything exceeding that amount at 40 percent. It also kept the exemptions and taxes the same for gifts made in a person's lifetime.
Here is a look at why people at different income levels need to pay attention to their estate plans.
THE NECESSITY OF FEAR When his nephew was about to marry in March, Mr. Kessler took the young man to lunch and offered advice: draft a will. While not exactly a romantic thought, it was a practical one. And Mr. Kessler said he often pressed clients with far less than $10 million to do the same -- and to revisit it often.
"They feel they've set this in motion and don't have to deal with this for 10 years," he said. "I'm not crazy about that idea. I usually bug them in three years."
It is easy to imagine a family with a modest amount of money having a child with a spending or substance abuse problem or a checkered marital history who would benefit from having an inheritance put into trust.
But there are simpler issues that could be overlooked if people figured there was no longer a need to think about an estate plan.
One is the beneficiary designation form, which determines who gets assets like a retirement account or an insurance policy. Many times, people fill out these forms when accounts are opened and then forget about them, even as the account or insurance policy grows or people's life situations change. That form overrides a will.
People with dependent children also need an estate plan to make sure they have life insurance and guardians for their children. "That's one of the major issues here," Mr. Kessler said. "Forget about when the kids get the money. It's, Who's going to take care of them?"
Some states intervene when a person dies without a will -- and charge fees to sort things out. In California, a will alone is not enough to avoid the state's getting involved in the probate process, said Andy Katzenstein, a partner in the personal planning department at Proskauer, a law firm.
A better plan, he said, would be to set up a revocable, or living, trust that holds the assets. It has the added advantage of keeping prying eyes out of someone's affairs.
"Michael Jackson's will is being probated," Mr. Katzenstein said. "He actually had a living trust, but he didn't put his assets in it."
He added, "Maybe your estate is less than $10 million and you're not going to pay federal estate taxes, but if you don't put it in a living trust, it's public and everyone can see what you have."
SPRING CLEANUP Many wealthy people made decisions last year about their estates that they may now regret because they expected that both the exemptions for the estate tax and the related gift tax would be reduced. In some cases, people gave away various types assets to beat the deadline.
Instead, both exemptions were actually raised. The gift tax exemption is $130,000 higher this year, and many of those who tried to beat the change at the end of last year now have to clean up what they did. Some people who rushed to make the gift put cash up to the $5.12 million limit, or $10.24 million for couples, into a trust, planning to substitute a less liquid asset -- say real estate or part of a company -- when they had time to get it valued. Yet since the trusts were written to give them plenty of time to do this, the risk now is that without pressure to get it done, they may forget about it.
"There isn't a time limit, but if you think assets are going up in value, the sooner you swap the noncash assets, the sooner you're moving the appreciation over to the other side," Mr. Katzenstein said.
There are worse situations to be in. Faith Xenos, chief investment officer of Singer Xenos Wealth Management, had a client who put shares of a building on elegant Lincoln Road in Miami Beach into a trust for his children. The building was valued at $50 million for the trust, a huge discount on what it was really worth but great for estate planning purposes.
"One quarter later, they were offered $100 million for it," she said. There was no way they could sell it without running afoul of the Internal Revenue Service because the building obviously didn't appreciate in value by that much in a few months. "It wouldn't pass the smell test," she said. "It was the tax tail wagging the dog."
NEW UNCERTAINTY The new estate tax amounts have been called permanent, but tax planners fear elected officials could change them at some point.
President Obama's budget proposal last week seeks to bring the exemption level -- "permanent" for a mere three months -- back to $3.5 million and increase the tax rate on assets exceeding that to 45 percent from 40 percent. This would not happen until 2018, if at all, but it has made people jittery about what else could change.
But a more immediate issue is an estate plan that has a credit shelter trust written into it. These trusts were used to make sure both spouses got their full exemptions. But the new law includes a provision called portability that allows the surviving spouse to use any leftover exemption amount, even if it was not put in trust.
If the estate tax exemption were to be reduced in the future, the portability of the leftover exemption might be lost. The more immediate concern is moving assets into a marital trust now may incur a state estate tax bill.
In New York, for example, the state exemption is $1 million. If a credit shelter trust were funded for $5 million, the estate could owe $400,000 to New York but nothing to the federal government. If the assets just passed to the spouse, the bill would be zero.
Jennifer Immel, senior wealth planner at PNC Wealth, said the wealthy could put provisions in their estate plans to use a credit shelter trust if the laws had changed again by the time the first spouse died. In other words, Ms. Immel said, "they can take the money outright or let it fund the trust."
And this shows why the world of estate planning remains complicated.
Correction: May 3, 2013, Friday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The Wealth Matters column on Saturday, about the intricacies of estate planning under new federal laws, misidentified a type of trust that is at issue under the new rules. It is a credit shelter trust, not a marital trust. (The two are treated differently under estate tax law, and the terms are not interchangeable as used in the column.)

Full text:   It's not great, but it's still probably the best growth the American economy is going to see for a while.
Economic activity picked up in the first quarter of this year, with output expanding at an annualized pace of 2.5 percent, according to a Commerce Department report released on Friday. The number was a welcome improvement from the unusually sluggish growth at the end of 2012, but significant government spending cuts and the pinch from recent tax increases look likely to keep the economy in stall speed in the months ahead.
"We just have not been able to hit escape velocity, to get us growing fast enough to make up for the ground we lost during the recession," said Steve Blitz, director and chief economist at ITG Investment Research. He forecasts growth around 2 to 2.5 percent for the rest of the year, which is slower than the economy's long-term average. "Government spending is clearly a negative, but the reason why it's such a strong negative is because there's nothing else in the private sector really driving things forward."
Economists noted that even the decent growth in the first quarter was probably somewhat overstated, with some of the improvement caused mostly by a rebound from the bare 0.4 annual growth rate in the fourth quarter of 2012. Businesses drew down their back-room inventories at the end of last year, so they needed to replenish them at the start of 2013. But that stockroom rebalancing appears to have restored inventories to acceptable levels and probably will not drive much more business spending growth later in the year.
Similarly, consumer spending was stronger in the first quarter, growing at its fastest pace since late 2010. But Mr. Blitz discounted even that apparently good news because so much of the extra spending was in housing and utility costs, which could have been driven by unusually cold weather.
It also seems unlikely that consumers will spend as freely in the months ahead, economists said. Consumer sentiment and retailer reports suggest that households are starting to feel squeezed from the lapse of the two-year payroll tax holiday. That meant the Social Security tax rate rose 2 percentage points in January, adding about $700 a year to the typical worker's tax bill.
Wage stagnation may also put a crimp in spending. Much of the job growth, after all, has been concentrated in relatively low-paying areas like food services and retail, and household incomes have been more or less flat since May, according to Sentier Research.
On the bright side, gas prices have fallen sharply in the last two months, which means households have more money free for other kinds of purchases.
The most immediate concern for many businesses and consumers is the shrinking government.
In the first quarter of this year, government spending fell at an annual rate of 8.4 percent, after a decrease of 14.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2012 -- with the cuts driven by sharp declines in military spending. Both declines happened largely before the bulk of Congress's across-the-board spending cuts took place. The so-called sequester is scheduled to strip $85 billion out of federal spending before Oct. 1, cuts that will have secondary effects throughout the private sector. Furloughed federal workers, for example, will spend less money at local businesses.
While lower government borrowing and spending can help free resources for business when the economy is operating closer to its capacity, that is not the case today. What may moderate the drag from federal spending cuts is the prospect that state and local governments may stop cutting and start spending more now that their tax revenue has risen in the last year, said Paul Dales, senior United States economist at Capital Economics.
Still, more federal cuts will probably overwhelm whatever may happen at the state and local levels.
"With fiscal tightening weighing on the spring and summer quarters, we expect weaker growth ahead," Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomic Advisers, said in a note to clients. "We have seen good quarters before, but what counts is sustainability, and on that score we are deeply unconvinced."
The pace of economic activity may have already begun to slow, given recent disappointing reports about economic indicators in March. Hiring slowed sharply last month, for example, and orders for durable goods like aircraft and metals fell more than analysts had expected. Some economists are keeping their fingers crossed that unusually cold weather was responsible for these dismal numbers, which would mean the slowdown was temporary.
Even some of the other bright spots in the latest gross domestic product report showed a slight slowdown from last quarter. Business spending on equipment and software, for example, rose at an annual rate of 3 percent in the first quarter of 2013, but not as quickly as in the fourth quarter of 2012, when it rose 11.8 percent. Residential investment spending -- housing, essentially -- had its third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, but again, the pace in the first quarter was not quite as robust as it was at the end of last year (12.6 percent annual growth in the first quarter, compared to 17.6 percent the previous quarter).
The housing recovery is "becoming an important driver of economic growth and will probably continue to be, which is one thing that really sets the U.S. out from other countries right now," Mr. Dales said.
Strength in the housing market, particularly the rise in home prices, could make consumers feel richer and therefore more willing to spend, said Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist at MFR Inc. He cautioned that the housing market might not be a strong driver of growth for very long, because the current rebound is coming from "unsustainably low levels of activity from the depths of the recession." In the future, he said, "we'll probably see a calmer rate of growth."
Nothing in Friday's report looks likely to change Federal Reserve policy, economists said. The Fed has indicated it will slow its asset purchases and raise interest rates only after considerable economic improvement.
Justin Wolfers, an economics professor at the University of Michigan, said the government's fiscal policy was a drag on the economy. He suggested that the Fed might also not be doing enough to bolster employment, given that inflation rates are still below official targets.
"The bigger picture is that we have a fledgling recovery which needs help but isn't getting it," he said.
Friday's report was the Commerce Department's initial estimate for gross domestic product growth, and the numbers will be revised substantially in coming months. This summer the department will also will also release its benchmark revisions, which are a more comprehensive overhaul of how it calculates the size and growth of the economy. Those revisions will probably affect all of the numbers released over the last several decades.

Abstract: The Labor Department last week reported the levels of "usual weekly wages" reported by Americans questioned in the household survey that determines the unemployment rate. The Consumer Price Index in the third quarter of 2010 was a little lower than it had been two years earlier. Because wages are "sticky," they tend not to decline in nominal terms even if there is deflation.

Full text:   THE median pay of American workers has stagnated in recent years, but that is not true for all workers. When adjusted for inflation, the wages of low-paid workers have declined. But the wages for better-paid workers have grown significantly more rapidly than inflation.
The Labor Department last week reported the levels of "usual weekly wages" reported by Americans questioned in the household survey that determines the unemployment rate. The figures are released quarterly, with details on the distribution of wages available since 2000.
Those figures are different from total income, in that they ignore investment income as well as bonuses or overtime that is not considered usual. The national median wage in the first quarter of this year was $827 a week. In 2013 dollars, the median wage 13 years before was $819, so the increase is about 1 percent. The figures include all workers over the age of 25.
The department said that to reach the 90th percentile -- that is, to earn more money than 90 percent of those with jobs -- a person needed to earn $1,909 a week. That figure was nearly 9 percent higher than in early 1980.
To reach the 10th percentile -- earning less money than 90 percent of those with jobs -- required an income of $387 a week. After adjusting for inflation, that figure is down 3 percent from 2000.
The accompanying charts show the trends over time for the 25th and 75th percentiles, as well as the median and the 10th and 90th percentiles.
Put another way, in 2000 a worker in the 75th percentile made 48 percent more than a worker at the median, or 50th percentile. Now, a worker in that group earns 58 percent more.
The trends have been similar within education groups. The median income of college graduates in the first quarter of this year was $1,189 a week. Adjusted for inflation, that figure was about 1 percent less than the median 13 years earlier. To make the 90th percentile, a college graduate needed to earn $2,585 a week, a figure that is about 8 percent higher than the 2000 earnings needed.
There were somewhat similar trends among those with only high school diplomas, who are shown in the chart, and among those who attended college but did not earn a bachelor's degree. Only among high school dropouts was the pattern different. Their real wages have fallen at every percentile.
The accompanying charts seem to indicate that real incomes went up for most groups during the financial crisis in 2009. That is, at least, a little misleading for several reasons. First, the number of people with full-time jobs declined. To the extent that those who lost jobs tended to be nearer the lower end of the wage distribution, that by itself would automatically raise the median income.
The second reason for that is that inflation virtually vanished during the crisis. The Consumer Price Index in the third quarter of 2010 was a little lower than it had been two years earlier. Because wages are "sticky," they tend not to decline in nominal terms even if there is deflation. But when inflation returned, wage levels did not keep up.
It should also be noted that the people in the top 10 percent, or the bottom 10 percent, may change from one year to the next. It is possible that some people in the bottom 10 percent did better than the charts indicate, moving up to a higher percentile in later years. And, of course, some people presumably moved in the other direction as well.

Debt, Growth and the Austerity Debate

Abstract: (In 2012, the ratio of debt to gross domestic product was 106 percent in the United States, 82 percent in Germany and 90 percent in Britain -- in Japan, the figure is 238 percent, but Japan is somewhat exceptional because its debt is held almost entirely by domestic residents and it is a creditor to the rest of the world.) The fact that high-debt episodes last so long suggests that they are not, as some liberal economists contend, simply a matter of downturns in the business cycle.

Full text:   CAMBRIDGE, Mass.
IN May 2010, we published an academic paper, "Growth in a Time of Debt." Its main finding, drawing on data from 44 countries over 200 years, was that in both rich and developing countries, high levels of government debt -- specifically, gross public debt equaling 90 percent or more of the nation's annual economic output -- was associated with notably lower rates of growth.
Given debates occurring across the industrialized world, from Washington to London to Brussels to Tokyo, about the best way to recover from the Great Recession, that paper, along with other research we have published, has frequently been cited -- and, often, exaggerated or misrepresented -- by politicians, commentators and activists across the political spectrum.
Last week, three economists at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, released a paper criticizing our findings. They correctly identified a spreadsheet coding error that led us to miscalculate the growth rates of highly indebted countries since World War II. But they also accused us of "serious errors" stemming from "selective exclusion" of relevant data and "unconventional weighting" of statistics -- charges that we vehemently dispute. (In an online-only appendix accompanying this essay, we explain the methodological and technical issues that are in dispute.)
Our research, and even our credentials and integrity, have been furiously attacked in newspapers and on television. Each of us has received hate-filled, even threatening, e-mail messages, some of them blaming us for layoffs of public employees, cutbacks in government services and tax increases. As career academic economists (our only senior public service has been in the research department at the International Monetary Fund) we find these attacks a sad commentary on the politicization of social science research. But our feelings are not what's important here.
The authors of the paper released last week -- Thomas Herndon, Michael Ash and Robert Pollin -- say our "findings have served as an intellectual bulwark in support of austerity politics" and urge policy makers to "reassess the austerity agenda itself in both Europe and the United States."
A sober reassessment of austerity is the responsible course for policy makers, but not for the reasons these authors suggest. Their conclusions are less dramatic than they would have you believe. Our 2010 paper found that, over the long term, growth is about 1 percentage point lower when debt is 90 percent or more of gross domestic product. The University of Massachusetts researchers do not overturn this fundamental finding, which several researchers have elaborated upon.
The academic literature on debt and growth has for some time been focused on identifying causality. Does high debt merely reflect weaker tax revenues and slower growth? Or does high debt undermine growth?
Our view has always been that causality runs in both directions, and that there is no rule that applies across all times and places. In a paper published last year with Vincent R. Reinhart, we looked at virtually all episodes of sustained high debt in the advanced economies since 1800. Nowhere did we assert that 90 percent was a magic threshold that transforms outcomes, as conservative politicians have suggested.
We did find that episodes of high debt (90 percent or more) were rare, long and costly. There were just 26 cases where the ratio of debt to G.D.P. exceeded 90 percent for five years or more; the average high-debt spell was 23 years. In 23 of the 26 cases, average growth was slower during the high-debt period than in periods of lower debt levels. Indeed, economies grew at an average annual rate of roughly 3.5 percent, when the ratio was under 90 percent, but at only a 2.3 percent rate, on average, at higher relative debt levels.
(In 2012, the ratio of debt to gross domestic product was 106 percent in the United States, 82 percent in Germany and 90 percent in Britain -- in Japan, the figure is 238 percent, but Japan is somewhat exceptional because its debt is held almost entirely by domestic residents and it is a creditor to the rest of the world.)
The fact that high-debt episodes last so long suggests that they are not, as some liberal economists contend, simply a matter of downturns in the business cycle.
In "This Time Is Different," our 2009 history of financial crises over eight centuries, we found that when sovereign debt reached unsustainable levels, so did the cost of borrowing, if it was even possible at all. The current situation confronting Italy and Greece, whose debts date from the early 1990s, long before the 2007-8 global financial crisis, support this view.
The politically charged discussion, especially sharp in the past week or so, has falsely equated our finding of a negative association between debt and growth with an unambiguous call for austerity.
We agree that growth is an elusive goal at times of high debt. We know that cutting spending and raising taxes is tough in a slow-growth economy with persistent unemployment. Austerity seldom works without structural reforms -- for example, changes in taxes, regulations and labor market policies -- and if poorly designed, can disproportionately hit the poor and middle class. Our consistent advice has been to avoid withdrawing fiscal stimulus too quickly, a position identical to that of most mainstream economists.
In some cases, we have favored more radical proposals, including debt restructuring (a polite term for partial default) of public and private debts. Such restructurings helped deal with the debt buildup during World War I and the Depression. We have long favored write-downs of sovereign debt and senior bank debt in the European periphery (Greece, Portugal, Ireland, Spain) to unlock growth.
In the United States, we support reducing mortgage principal on homes that are underwater (where the mortgage is higher than the value of the home). We have also written about plausible solutions that involve moderately higher inflation and "financial repression" -- pushing down inflation-adjusted interest rates, which effectively amounts to a tax on bondholders. This strategy contributed to the significant debt reductions that followed World War II.
In short: many countries around the world have extraordinarily high public debts by historical standards, especially when medical and old-age support programs are taken into account. Resolving these debt burdens usually involves a transfer, often painful, from savers to borrowers. This time is no different, and the latest academic kerfuffle should not divert our attention from that fact.

Abstract: The government's economists remain bullish about growth, arguing that Paraguay, devastated by a 19th-century war that wiped out most of its male population and ruled throughout much of the 20th century by Gen. Alfredo Stroessner, one of the world's longest-ruling dictators, is emerging from decades of ostracism in the global economy.

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDEDASUNCIÓN, Paraguay -- Walk into the headquarters of the central bank of Paraguay, a sprawling seven-story structure surrounded by flowering silk floss trees, and the message is clear: officials proudly display charts showing a dizzying economic boom, with growth reaching 13 percent this year, making Paraguay the fastest-growing country in the Americas.
But just a few minutes away by car one recent morning, grandmothers waded through raw sewage in the labyrinthine slum of La Chacarita, scavenging copper wire and aluminum cans to sell at scrap yards.
"Tell me about this growth," said Cecilia Aguirre, 60, grasping a plastic bag holding her day's takings, worth about $4. Squinting under the hot sun, she said she worked every day to feed the four grandchildren who live in her home. Asked about Paraguay's robust economy, she added, "I've heard of no such thing in my lifetime."
Indeed, Paraguay's economic boom, fueled by bountiful harvests of export commodities like soybeans and corn, exists only in pockets. In parts of Asunción, showrooms are selling out of Porsches and Audis, and cranes are putting the finishing touches on luxury towers like the Ícono, a 37-story skyscraper of SoHo-inspired lofts.
Yet much of the country, which has long figured among South America's poorest and most unequal nations, remains left behind. More than 30 percent of the population lives in poverty, according to the central bank, and Paraguay ranks near the bottom among South American countries in reducing poverty over the last decade, according to the United Nations.
Social spending for antipoverty projects is minimal, largely because taxation is lacking. Paraguay did not even have an income tax until this year, but even though the new across-the-board rate is low, at 10 percent, few people are expected to pay it, as exemptions and loopholes abound. The result: the economic boom may be accentuating the festering inequality in one of Latin America's most politically unstable nations.
"Nearly all of the growth is driven by highly mechanized agriculture, which generates few jobs for the population," said Andrew Nickson, an expert on Paraguay's development policies at the University of Birmingham in Britain. "With a government that finances itself largely through value-added taxes and taxes on imports, you have a situation rather like a low-income African country."
Paraguay is a landlocked nation about the size of California, sandwiched between southern Brazil and northern Argentina, with a population of 6.5 million. About 77 percent of its arable land is controlled by 1 percent of the nation's landowners, according to the last agricultural census, and land disputes simmer in various parts of the country.
Activists claim that for decades large tracts of land were illegally distributed by corrupt officials, leaving many land titles in question. In one particularly bloody clash last June, 11 peasants and six police officers were killed at a soy estate in Curuguaty, in eastern Paraguay.
Legislators seized on that episode as a way to oust Fernando Lugo, the former Roman Catholic bishop who was elected president in 2008, ending six decades of one-party rule. Mr. Lugo had initially been expected to focus on reducing inequality, but faced obstacles in doing so.
Paraguay's new president is one of the nation's wealthiest men, the tobacco magnate Horacio Cartes, who was elected Sunday after promoting conservative, business-friendly policies during his campaign. He recognized poverty as an issue but has been vague about any plans for reducing it beyond trying to create more jobs through private investment.
The government's economists remain bullish about growth, arguing that Paraguay, devastated by a 19th-century war that wiped out most of its male population and ruled throughout much of the 20th century by Gen. Alfredo Stroessner, one of the world's longest-ruling dictators, is emerging from decades of ostracism in the global economy.
Paraguay sold $500 million of bonds in January in international markets, a rare source of financing for a nation overlooked by many foreign bankers for decades. Inflation and unemployment remain low, at less than 2 percent and less than 6 percent, respectively, and the overall poverty rate has fallen to about 32 percent in 2011 from 44 percent in 2003, said Roland Horst, a board member at the central bank.
"We do have a peasant issue now and then," Mr. Horst said in an interview. "But there is less tension than 10 years ago." He said the government had been trying to reduce poverty, noting that a program of giving small cash stipends to people in extreme poverty, begun in 2005, now included more than 75,000 families. Other economists, however, dispute such sunny assessments, arguing that the economy remains subject to wide swings, surging this year thanks in part to favorable weather conditions for certain crops, after contracting slightly in 2012 when farmers struggled with a drought.
They also contend that Paraguay's social welfare programs remain meager compared with antipoverty projects in neighboring countries, which have lifted tens of millions of people out of abject living conditions. They blame Paraguay's relatively weak state, with tax collection corresponding to only about 18 percent of gross domestic product, a figure lower than that of African nations like Congo and Chad.
"The statistics showing historically low unemployment are a farce," said Luis Rojas Villagra, an economist at the National University, who estimates that as much as half of Paraguay's work force is unemployed or underemployed in jobs with degrading wages and working conditions.
"How is it possible to reconcile the fact that hundreds of people survive each day by sifting through garbage in the municipal dump of Asunción while Paraguayans are also the biggest per-capita spenders in Punta del Este?" said Mr. Rojas Villagra, referring to the Uruguayan resort city where rich Paraguayans vacation alongside moneyed Argentines and Brazilians.
Such contrasts persist across Paraguay's economy. Pockets of luxury, for instance, are expanding near Ciudad del Este, the city on the Brazilian border renowned as a smuggler's haven.
One development, the Paraná Country Club, includes mansions selling for more than $3 million, largely to soybean growers or business executives from Brazil who have opened factories in Paraguay, a migration of manufacturing that is starting to resemble that of companies from the United States opening factories in low-wage Mexican border cities.
"2013 is starting to look like an amazing year," said Thelma Amaral, an architect who designs homes near Ciudad del Este.
But elsewhere, including the soybean regions at the root of the growth, examples abound of disparities and disputes, largely over land. A small leftist rebel group, the Paraguayan People's Army, has been picking off security forces in remote areas. Last weekend, the group killed at least one police officer and wounded several others.
In December, gunmen shot dead Vidal Vega, a leader of the peasant movement involved in the deadly clash at Curuguaty. He had been expected to be a witness at the criminal trial intended to shed light on the massacre. The inquiry into his killing, as in similar cases of peasant leaders killed in Paraguay in recent years, has turned up few leads.
Correction: April 29, 2013, Monday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Thursday about how an economic boom is under way in pockets of Paraguay but not in much of the country, one of South America's poorest, misspelled the surname of an expert on Paraguay's development policies at the University of Birmingham in Britain. He is Andrew Nickson, not Dickson.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- In July 1996, the Federal Reserve broke the metronomic routine of its closed-door policy-making meetings to hold an unusual debate. The Fed's powerful chairman, Alan Greenspan, saw a chance for the first time in decades to drive annual inflation all the way down to zero, achieving the price stability he had long regarded as the central bank's primary mission.
But Janet L. Yellen, then a relatively new and little-known Fed governor, talked Mr. Greenspan to a standstill that day, arguing that a little inflation was a good thing. She marshaled academic research that showed it would reduce the depth and frequency of recessions, articulating a view that has prevailed at the Fed. And as the Fed's vice chairwoman since 2010, Ms. Yellen has played a leading role in cementing the central bank's commitment to keep prices rising about 2 percent each year.
Ms. Yellen is now widely viewed as a logical candidate to succeed the current Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, when his term ends in January 2014. She has worked closely with him in shaping and building support for the Fed's campaign to stimulate the economy and bring down unemployment.
But some of Ms. Yellen's critics remain wary. They worry that she would not be sufficiently concerned about the possibility that inflation will accelerate as the economic recovery gains strength. If nominated, she could face opposition from Senate Republicans who have repeatedly expressed concern that the Fed's campaign would destabilize financial markets and make controlling the pace of inflation more difficult.
"I think people read Janet Yellen's speeches as saying that she puts a higher weight on joblessness compared to inflation" than the typical member of the Fed's policy-making committee, said Vincent Reinhart, formerly the head of the Fed's monetary policy staff and now the chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley. "And that includes Ben Bernanke."
He added, however, that her nomination would be unlikely to shake financial markets because she already exercises considerable influence, so any shift in policy would most likely be modest.
Moreover, Ms. Yellen's personal qualities, highlighted by the 1996 episode, have helped her win supporters even among her ideological opponents.
"She makes an argument on the merits and she sticks with it," said Alan Blinder, an economics professor at Princeton nominated to the Fed alongside Ms. Yellen in 1994. "And she's good at articulating an argument in a way that doesn't leave people on the other side hopping mad at her."
Despite their disagreement at the time, Mr. Greenspan said that he continued to hold Ms. Yellen in high regard. "I did listen to her more carefully because she articulates her position in a way that you can follow it analytically," he said in an interview. "Intuitions are useless. Janet's conversation and her presentations were factually based, and that always got my attention."
If confirmed, Ms. Yellen would become the first woman to lead a major central bank. She is 66, seven years older than Mr. Bernanke. She would be 71 by the end of a four-year term as chairwoman. But she remains in good health, and friends say that, like other prominent women of her generation, she regards herself as being in the prime of a late-blooming career. Nor would she be the oldest person to lead the Fed. Mr. Greenspan began his fifth and final term in 2004 at 78.
Ms. Yellen, slight, white-haired and described by one colleague as a "small lady with a large I.Q.," does not loom like Paul Volcker nor cut like Mr. Greenspan. Her personal style more closely resembles Mr. Bernanke's soft-spoken manner. The force of her arguments can catch people by surprise.
Kevin Hassett, a staff economist at the Fed when Ms. Yellen arrived in 1994, recalled that she started to eat lunch regularly in the staff cafeteria to subvert the hierarchical system that limited communication between Fed governors and the vast army of research economists. Other governors had tried to change the rules but Ms. Yellen, he said, found a way around them.
"It showed a kind of grace and wisdom that is very unusual in Washington," said Mr. Hassett, now a fellow at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute.
Mr. Hassett is among those who worry that Ms. Yellen does not place a sufficient emphasis on controlling inflation. "But I hold her in the highest possible regard," he said. If the Obama administration is "going to pick a Fed chair that thinks the way they do, then Janet Yellen would be the best possible choice."
There has been no official word from the White House or Mr. Bernanke that the Fed will have a new chairman next year. The decision is up to Mr. Obama, and aides say he has not yet focused on who he wants in the job.
But Mr. Bernanke may have signaled his departure last week when the Fed announced that he planned to skip an annual summer conference in Jackson Hole, Wyo. The Fed's chairman has attended the event in each of the previous 25 years.
People who have spoken with Mr. Bernanke say he is tired after leading the Fed through eight years that were mostly consumed by crisis. Mr. Bernanke has also sought to make monetary policy more transparent and predictable, dispelling the image of the Fed chairman as a kind of artist. "I don't think that I'm the only person in the world who can manage the exit" from the Fed's current policies, he said last month. The only way to prove that point would be to let someone else do it.
President Obama, for his part, has the opportunity to nominate the first Democrat to lead the Federal Reserve since President Carter chose Mr. Volcker in 1979 -- and the person he selects will serve a term that extends two years beyond his own.
Ms. Yellen has avoided questions about her future, but she, too, appeared to address the subject indirectly this month. Asked about the dearth of female economic policy makers, she responded that it was "something we're going to see increase over time, and it's time for that to happen."
She declined a request to be interviewed for this article.
There are other potential candidates for the job, including Roger W. Ferguson Jr. and Professor Blinder, both former Fed officials, and economic advisers to Mr. Obama including Timothy F. Geithner and Lawrence H. Summers. But Ms. Yellen appears to be the front-runner in a race that has not actually started quite yet.
None of the other obvious candidates possess the same combination of academic credentials and policy-making experience. No Fed chairman has been as deeply steeped in both the theory and practice of central banking.
"In the realm of plausible candidates, she is by far the best," said Christina Romer, a former chairwoman of Mr. Obama's Council of Economic Advisers who is an economics professor at the University of California, Berkeley. She has known Ms. Yellen for years and counts her as a friend.
Asked who else she would recommend that the president consider for the job, Ms. Romer responded, "I would stop after No. 1."
Ms. Yellen, born in Brooklyn in 1946, has said that she became interested in economics as a way of thinking logically about how to help people. She studied at Yale under the Nobel laureate James Tobin, a leading proponent of the view that governments could mitigate recessions. Professor Tobin, now dead, told Business Week magazine in 1997 that Ms. Yellen had "a genius for expressing complicated arguments simply and clearly."
She built an academic career at Berkeley together with her husband, the economist George A. Akerlof, whom she met in a Fed cafeteria. Much of their work together highlighted flaws in the economic theory that markets operate efficiently, a theory that basically treats government policy as inherently costly. Their work showed that government, including central banks, could indeed adopt economic policies that improved people's lives.
Colleagues and people familiar with their work said that Professor Akerlof, who shared the Nobel in economics in 2001 with Joseph E. Stiglitz and A. Michael Spence, was the more creative thinker, while Professor Yellen was more rigorous
"George can sometimes go off in a direction that is untethered from the real world, and Janet was better at bringing it back," said Professor Romer, who joined the Berkeley economics faculty with her husband and collaborator, David Romer, about a decade after Ms. Yellen and Mr. Akerlof.
In 1994, the Clinton administration nominated Ms. Yellen to the Fed on the recommendation of Laura D'Andrea Tyson, a colleague at Berkeley then serving as the head of the Council of Economic Advisers.
Ms. Yellen and Professor Blinder were chosen to check the Fed's tendency to curtail growth for fear of inflation. But in an unlikely twist, Mr. Greenspan became the strongest advocate for letting the economy grow more quickly, and Ms. Yellen helped provide intellectual justification for keeping interest rates low.
"She was much more aware of the current state of academic literature on fairly technical issues," Mr. Greenspan recalled. "I found her very useful in that regard."
At the time of the 1996 debate, inflation had fallen to a relatively stable pace of about 3 percent a year, eliminating much of the unpredictability that had plagued the economy. Mr. Greenspan saw clear benefits in pushing all the way to zero. But some economists worried that lower inflation might result in permanently higher unemployment, by making it difficult to adjust wages. And it would bring the economy dangerously close to deflation, the destabilizing condition in which falling prices freeze economic activity as people anticipate lower prices.
"I believe that heading toward 2 percent inflation would be a good idea, and that we should do so in a slow fashion, looking at what happens along the way," Ms. Yellen said at the 1996 meeting. The debate continued for years; the Fed finally adopted a 2 percent inflation target last year.
But Laurence H. Meyer, a former Fed governor, recalled the 1996 meeting as a turning point. "She was the one who really brought the story that inflation could be too low," said Mr. Meyer, a senior adviser at MacroEconomic Advisers. "And she was very effective. Once she said it, it seemed so obvious and sensible."
Ms. Yellen began a second stint at the Fed in 2004 when she was named president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. She has played a leading role in the Fed's movement to provide "forward guidance" about the path of policy over the next several years, persuading investors that it is safe to accept lower interest rates.
But it is easy to overstate her differences with those more focused on inflation. "I think I am as committed to price stability and the attainment of price stability as any member of the F.O.M.C.," a reference to the Federal Open Market Committee, Ms. Yellen said at a 2010 luncheon in Los Angeles. "When the time has come, am I going to support raising interest rates? You bet."

Full text:   Last week the International Monetary Fund hosted a conference of some of the world's top macroeconomists to assess how the most intense crisis to have shaken the industrialized economies since the Great Depression has changed the profession's collective understanding of how the world economy works.
Two things struck me about the conclave. The first was hearing George Akerlof, a Nobel-winning economist from Berkeley, take to the lectern to compare the crisis to a cat stuck in a tree, afraid to move.
The second was realizing how, after five years of coping with the consequences of the disaster, there is still so much uncertainty about what policies are needed to prevent another financial shock from tipping the world economy into the abyss again a few years down the road.
"We don't have a sense of the final destination," said Olivier Blanchard, chief economist of the monetary fund. "Where we end I really don't have much of a clue."
In determining what is a sustainable level of government debt, or whether central banks should focus on anything other than inflation, or what should be done to prevent further bubbles from destabilizing economies, he argued "we are still very much navigating by sight."
If you are one of the nearly five million American workers who have been unemployed for over six months, or one of the six million Spaniards, three million Italians or 1.3 million Greeks without a job or a clear prospect of finding one, this amounts to a tragedy.
Considering that the large and complicated financial institutions that set off the crisis five years ago have only gotten larger and more complex, the gap in knowledge is downright scary.
It is scarier to consider how politicians have chosen to ignore much of what the profession has learned from the experience.
Berkeley's David Romer counted six shocks that hit the United States in the last three decades alone. The economy dodged the bullet in two -- the Latin American debt crisis of the 1980s and the Russian default in the 1990s, which led to the bailout of a hedge fund, Long-Term Capital Management.
It took a hit in three -- the collapse of much of the savings and loan industry in the late 1980s, the 1987 stock market crash and the dot.com implosion. But it got hammered in the last one.
Economists used to think it was obvious how to contain such shocks. No point trying to stop a bubble from inflating, they thought; it would be impossible to identify in the first place. The best a central bank like the Federal Reserve could do is stand ready to cut interest rates after the bubble burst, patch up the financial system and set the economy back on track. In terms of budgets, governments should aim for a prudent level of debt to retain space to borrow and spend when it was needed.
Now, interest rates have been near zero for years, and growth has not been restored to acceptable levels. And few if any of the economists gathered at the International Monetary Fund's headquarters in Washington would venture a guess about what level of debt would be prudent these days.
On the eve of the financial crisis, Spain's net debt was just over 25 percent of its economic output. The ratio of net debt to gross domestic product in Ireland hovered around 11 percent. Martin Wolf, chief economic commentator of The Financial Times, said that Britain's debt ratio was close to a 300-year low, way below its level during the Industrial Revolution.
It wasn't low enough, apparently. Five years later, Ireland's bailout of its banks took its net debt to 102 percent of its economic output. Spain's debt hit 80 percent of G.D.P. And Britain's reached 86 percent -- the highest since the 1960s.
This is of enormous consequence. One lesson from the crisis -- first learned in the 1930s and corroborated in several contemporary analyses -- is that when interest rates lose their power to stimulate the economy, additional government spending can help generate real growth. Still, the fear of "excessive" debt has led many governments to cut spending even in the face of economic stagnation.
Countries like Ireland and Spain have pretty much lost their ability to raise money in financial markets. They are now struggling to reduce debt with little success: cutting public spending in the midst of severe downturns only makes economic performance worse, adding to the debt burden.
Yet even in Britain or the United States, which can still borrow at near-record-low interest rates, governments have taken to cutting public spending at the expense of growth and jobs.
Perhaps this is natural. After all, the crisis upended a consensus. Economists and policy makers bred to think that all that was needed to run a prosperous economy was to keep inflation low, strive for fiscal balance and deregulate have found themselves in a more complex world. In this world, financial bubbles matter, capital flows are of dubious merit, low interest rates fail to stimulate growth and government spending becomes the only tool with real traction to spur economic activity.
And there is reason to be cautious. With total government debt in the rich world stuck at around 100 percent of its combined economic output, there is a legitimate fear that a rise in interest rates could tip off a financial death spiral. Moreover, if countries with debt levels well under 50 percent of G.D.P. were so devastated by the crisis, it is hard to imagine what might happen to them if another were to hit them.
Still, the argument against debt is often overstated. Disagreement and uncertainty among economists have given the political systems in Europe and the United States ample license to engage in austerity policies that frankly are proving counterproductive -- making recovery more difficult and painful.
In his assessment at the end of the conference, Mr. Akerlof argued that the response in the United States had been reasonable. From the bank bailout to the fiscal stimulus to zero short-term interest rates, "the economic policies postrecovery have been close to what a good, sensible economist doctor would have ordered" for the stranded cat.
But other economists were not quite as sanguine. Indeed, one take-away from the economic conclave is that it may be a fantasy to think that the world's economies can be steeled to withstand a shock like those the financial system can provide. If so, the urgent task is what kind of limits should be imposed on banking and the rest of finance to temper its propensity to careen toward disaster.
Financial regulation is being tightened around the world. Banks are being required to raise more capital than before. Bigger banks face tougher rules. Still, there is no consensus on which new institutions might be needed to monitor and temper finance, or how tough the rules should be.
What good does the modern financial system do, for the rest of us? What determines financial fluctuations and shocks? How do they affect the broader economy? What can governments do to make them less disruptive? Economists have few answers.
"We don't have a clue of what financial stability actually means," Mr. Blanchard confessed.
Mr. Romer said, "Five years into a crisis of this magnitude, we should be, 'Oh my God, the cat has been in the tree for five years, it's time to get the cat down out of the tree and figure out how to make sure the cat doesn't go up the tree again."'

Abstract: Agricultural commodities like wheat that are included in broad indexes like the GSCI have come to share in these price movements, he says. Because so many commodities are finite, Mr. Jacks says, population pressures and industrial growth have given prices a modest upward long-term trend that should eventually dominate again. Low interest rates and the liquidity uncorked by the Federal Reserve and other central banks helped account for commodities' climb in recent years, he says, but asset classes like stocks now benefit more from that easy money.

Full text:   IN waves of intense selling, an array of commodities extracted from beneath the earth's surface -- from gold and silver to oil, aluminum and copper -- has fallen sharply in price this month.
Each commodity is unique, of course, with its own problems and personality. Gold retains an almost theological status among some of its adherents, who say it's the one true store of value -- yet gold's price swings have been stunning. Oil has plenty of swagger, and its fluctuations have brought economies to their knees and countries into conflict. Copper is quietly useful and is said to convey so much information about global trends that it is called Dr. Copper -- the commodity with a Ph.D. in economics.
Yet despite many idiosyncrasies, commodities have been moving largely in the same direction. With some exceptions and interruptions -- notably, during the financial crisis -- all of these finite resources rose in value for a decade or so. And at least for the moment, that overriding trend appears to have been broken.
What is striking is that a broad market consensus has rapidly emerged: that the immediate prospects for many high-flying commodities have grown appreciably bleaker.
"I see further declines ahead for most commodities," says Julian Jessop, chief global economist and head of commodities research for Capital Economics in London.
In reports this month, a host of investment banks and brokerage firms have said that a range of commodities is caught in a downdraft. Edward L. Morse, global head of commodities research at Citigroup in New York, said he "expects 2013 to be the year in which the death bells ring for the commodity supercycle." This, he wrote, should be the first year "in over a decade in which, broadly, commodity prices end the year lower than when the year started."
Already this year, many commodities have built up deficits. Gold is down 16.3 percent, while silver, its less glamorous sidekick, has fallen 23.1 percent. Copper has lost 13.3 percent, and oil, 4.3 percent. The S.& P. GSCI index, which tracks a basket of commodities futures contracts, is down 7.5 percent.
If commodities don't recover together by year-end, it would be a significant reversal. From 2000 through March, gold prices rose 13.8 percent, annualized, compared with 10.9 percent for copper, 10.6 percent for oil and 9.6 percent for the S.& P. GSCI, according to Bloomberg. That's a reason Mr. Morse and some other analysts have called the long climb a supercycle.
David S. Jacks, an economics professor at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia who has analyzed more than 160 years of prices for 30 commodities, subscribes to this view. He says he has found a modest, 2 percent annualized price increase since 1950, adjusted for inflation. But he discerns supercycles within this trend. After roughly 15 years of generally upward movement, he believes that we have entered a phase of declining prices.
Like Mr. Morse and Mr. Jessop, he says that after the Asian currency crisis of the late 1990s, the explosive growth of resource-hungry emerging economies like China's helped set off a multiyear commodities price boom. And he says today's apparent slowdown in China, and signs of weakness in the global economy, have contributed to the current decline.
Mr. Jacks has found tight correlations among nearly all "hard" commodities -- "those that are extracted from the ground, rather than grown on it." Part of this may be because of the "financialization" of commodities -- their inclusion in indexes and exchange-traded funds that let traders place bets by pressing a button. Agricultural commodities like wheat that are included in broad indexes like the GSCI have come to share in these price movements, he says.
Because so many commodities are finite, Mr. Jacks says, population pressures and industrial growth have given prices a modest upward long-term trend that should eventually dominate again.
MR. JESSOP agrees with some but by no means all of this. While he expects gold to recover as an alternative to currencies like the dollar, he says commodities over all are likely to decline for a while.
Low interest rates and the liquidity uncorked by the Federal Reserve and other central banks helped account for commodities' climb in recent years, he says, but asset classes like stocks now benefit more from that easy money. He says shocks from the euro zone and China are more likely to hurt commodities than equities, especially in the United States. That's because stocks "represent a claim on the cash flow of corporations for years to come," he says, "and those long-term flows aren't as economically sensitive as commodities are."
But he does not recognize the existence of commodities supercycles.
"It's been more like a roller coaster, with booms and busts and prices moving up and down," he says. All else equal, he says, when prices rise, demand tends to decline and supply to increase -- leading to a glut. "I'm not sure that I see any cycles beyond that."
Jeremy Grantham, founder of the Boston asset management firm GMO, sees the commodities price decline as a short-term investing opportunity for individuals and for his own family foundation, which has made major donations to organizations focused on the environment, including InsideClimate News, the nonprofit that recently won a Pulitzer Prize.
Mr. Grantham says he is making long-term buys of "good farmland and forestry and, secondly, in good stuff in the ground like oil, copper, potash and phosphate." He quickly adds, "Skip coal and tar sands because they will be priced out of business." Natural gas, which has been plentiful and cheap in the United States, is likely to be in high demand and climb in price, he said.
Seeing the planet as endangered by climate change, he says human ingenuity must respond fast enough to stave off disaster. In the meantime, he says, crucial commodities are likely to be in scarce supply -- and he expects them to rise in value over the next decade.
"There just isn't enough of these things," Mr. Grantham said. "Of that I'm confident."

Full text:   SINCE 1997, we have lived through the biggest real estate bubble in United States history -- followed by the most calamitous decline in housing prices that the country has ever seen.
Fundamental factors like inflation and construction costs affect home prices, of course. But the radical shifts in housing prices in recent years were caused mainly by investor-induced speculation.
Anyone contemplating the purchase of a home wants an idea of where prices will be when it is eventually time to sell, perhaps many years later. For that kind of long-term forecasting, we need to understand the reasons for the recent, violent price cycle, and whether it is likely to repeat itself.
History has much to teach us about real estate bubbles, and some of it is reassuring. The land booms of New York State in the 1790s, Kansas in the 1850s, California in the 1880s and Florida in the 1920s all appear to have been relatively isolated events. And the cycle was not repeated in short order.
But those events were fundamentally different from the recent housing bubble. As relatively local phenomena, involving a fairly small number of adventurers, they did not consume most people's attention. And a major cause can be easily identified: they developed from the promotion of supposedly valuable lots of land.
In fact, outside of New York City and a few urban centers, most speculators in past decades didn't focus much on home prices. The term "housing bubble" was not even in their vocabulary. Land, not houses, was the object of their desires. They had "land mania" or "land fever."
In a 1932 book, "The Great American Land Bubble," Aaron M. Sakolski offers a vivid history of these manias, going back hundreds of years. There were repeated examples of promoters creating land subdivisions with vaunted plans for development, and advertising campaigns to sell them to investors.
As president in the 1790s, George Washington helped promote the sale of lots in his namesake capital city, and even bought some himself. Earlier in his life, he was a surveyor, and in 1763, he was a founder of the Mississippi Land Company, which was to acquire land, survey and subdivide it, and sell off individual farm and town plots to settlers. While his involvement in the development of Washington, D.C., was ultimately successful, his earlier company failed.
Land fevers tend to have a definite starting point and vector of contagion: they begin when a promoter subdivides land into lots small enough for many investors, and are usually accompanied by an advertising blitz with glowing descriptions of the future town and country, setting off a buzz and speculative excitement.
The Florida land bubble of the 1920s provided a turning point in public opinion, thanks to newspaper reporting around the country that made it clear that a mania was being artfully promoted. Anne O'Hare McCormick wrote in The New York Times in 1925: "What impressed me most was that every jungle and swamp and palmetto hummock from Lake City to Key West is staked out in city lots and offered for sale as building sites." Such colorful writing can have a lasting impact. Many people now remember the image of the trusting Northerner unwittingly buying a lot in a Florida swamp. And the whole enterprise of subdivision, advertising and promotion of empty lots for sale, which made the manias possible, faded.
Shady operators were called purveyors of "premature subdivisions" and "defunct subdivisions." Local regulators came to demand that development plans were at least intended to produce homes that people would actually live in, not sham operations to defraud ignorant investors.
The first widely documented, nationwide speculative fever attached to single-family homes, as opposed to lots, was in the housing boom of 1943 to 1950. But home prices remained relatively quiet for many years thereafter. Starting in the 1970s, home price bubbles became more frequent and severe. By the end of the 20th century, housing speculation became at least a pastime for many Americans.
THE great housing bubble of the 2000s was diffused widely through the population and didn't owe its beginnings to any single promotional scheme. The bubble became so big apparently because of a number of kinds of financial promotion -- of subprime mortgages, no-down-payment mortgages, securitized mortgages and other innovations.
It was also driven by confusion about supply: people without much experience with housing bubbles seemed to accept the old real estate argument that because land is finite, its price must rise. And they may have thought that when they bought a home, they were primarily investing in land.
If so, they were wrong, but not by as much as they would have been in previous decades. According to a 2007 study by Morris Davis of the University of Wisconsin and Jonathan Heathcote of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, the share of nonfarm home value accounted for by land rose to 36.4 percent in 2000 from 15.3 percent in 1930. In an update, they put the percentage at 23.7 percent in the third quarter of 2012.
In fact, except in some densely populated areas, the value of a home has always been mostly in the structure, not the land. But because land's fraction was rising until recently, people may have been deluded into thinking that investments in housing and land were one and the same.
By 2000, many people appeared to have forgotten that when home prices rise sharply, builders are likely to increase the supply, which tends to bring prices back down. We had such a supply response in the 2000s, and with a vengeance. In the near future, at least, while a speculative investing culture may re-emerge among homeowners, it is likely to be tempered by the memory of crashing prices.
Housing prices themselves aren't the only speculative factors relevant to the housing market. Speculation in the bond or mortgage market counts as well.
Interest rates have been declining for decades now. Clearly, that cannot continue on the same track for another 10 years, because rates would have to turn negative.
But, of course, inflation can rise -- and it's easy to imagine that both it and interest rates will rise substantially, creating a bonanza for home buyers who have already locked in low rates. And because rates are so low now, they could climb a lot once they turn.
In short, it's quite possible that the next decade might bear a resemblance to the 1960s or '70s, when inflation and interest rates kept surprising people on the upside, culminating in 18 percent rates on 30-year mortgages in 1981, and inflation that was almost as high.
Homeowners did very well if they bought in 1960 or 1970, locked in low fixed-rate mortgages and saw the nominal values of their homes soar while their real mortgage balances declined. (Buyers since then have generally not fared as spectacularly.)
A more moderate path is also possible: without going back to the extremes of the '60s or '70s, higher fixed-rate mortgage rates might return.
With rates now relatively low, this could be an auspicious time to buy a house with a fixed-rate mortgage. That could make good sense for people who aren't out to bet on the housing or mortgage markets but are instead focused on settling into a home for the long term.

Full text:   What do you get when you combine evangelical fervor with leverage and rising speculation?
The gold market, circa 2013.
In the more than four decades since President Richard M. Nixon severed the dollar's last ties to gold, there have been two bull markets in gold -- markets that peaked not that far apart, when adjusted for inflation. To a believer, gold is different from any other commodity. The others are expected to rise and fall with supply and demand. A supply shock, perhaps caused by a drought in Brazil or a confrontation in the Persian Gulf, may send the price of orange juice or oil soaring. A fall in economic activity may depress the value of any industrial commodity. A commodity, like any other investment, can become overvalued or undervalued.
But to the faithful, that doesn't include gold. Sure, it has uses in the real economy, like jewelry and dentistry. But that is not the important issue. To them, it is money. It cannot be overvalued.
There was a time when gold really was money, when the gold standard reigned supreme. Its record was not an especially good one. There was the minor issue of supply shocks -- as when gold from the New World caused drastic inflation in Spain -- and there were repeated panics and depressions in the 19th century. A determination to stick to the gold standard helped worsen the Great Depression.
But to those who revere gold, such problems are minor compared to the sins of fiat money, which is defined as money not anchored in gold but instead determined by central bankers, who can -- and eventually will -- surrender to political pressures to devalue the currency. Discretion will be abused.
Those who back the gold standard think "you can design a rule that will tell you what to do, no matter what the circumstances," says Robert J. Barbera, the co-director of the Center for Financial Economics at Johns Hopkins University. "But there is no one-size-fits-all rule for monetary policy. Ultimately, you need discretion."
Central bankers go in and out of fashion. Back in the late 1970s and early 1980s, as inflation grew and grew in the United States and other developed economies, their credibility was challenged as never before. Gold, and its sort-of sibling, silver, soared, but then crashed back to earth well before Paul A. Volcker, then the chairman of the Federal Reserve, proved he could and would tame inflation, even if doing so sent the American economy into back-to-back recessions.
During January 1980, as the first of those recessions was beginning, gold went from a little over $500 an ounce to $850 and then back under $700.
By early 1999, when Time Magazine put the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, on its cover as the head of "the Committee to Save the World," central bankers had become geniuses. (The other members of that committee were the former Treasury secretary, Robert E. Rubin, and his deputy at the time, Lawrence H. Summers, who later succeeded Mr. Rubin.) The stock market was booming, recessions were distant memories and gold was under $300 an ounce.
After 1980, gold never got close to $800 an ounce until, once again, the central bankers began to look imperfect. In 2007, as the American economy struggled to deal with what was then seen as the subprime housing crisis, gold climbed back above $800 and then set a new high, in nominal dollars, early in 2008, early in the American recession.
This time around, the sin of central banks appeared to be one of inadequate regulation, and of allowing a credit boom to get out of hand. If William McChesney Martin Jr., a former Fed chairman, once said the Fed's job was "to take away the punch bowl just when the party gets going," Mr. Greenspan was spiking the punch during his final years.
The hostility to the Fed since then has been largely based on worries that, Ben S. Bernanke, Mr. Greenspan's successor, was going to destroy the dollar. Having lowered short-term rates to virtually zero, the Fed and other central banks have purchased huge quantities of government bonds. That is not printing money in the sense that no printing press is involved, but in every other sense it is.
Surely, said those who believe in gold, burdensome inflation was just around the corner. The Republican platform in 2012 did not use the phrase "gold standard," but said "as we face the task of cleaning up the wreckage of the current administration's policies," a Republican administration would appoint a "commission to investigate possible ways to set a fixed value for the dollar."
By the time of the Republican convention, it turned out, gold had peaked at a little more than $1,900 an ounce. This week, in what looked like panic selling, the metal fell back below $1,400.
In 1980, as in this year, gold had attracted a lot of speculators who might or might not care about a gold standard, but who knew a rising market when they saw one. Exchange-traded funds have made it a lot easier to invest in gold -- no need to store a gold bar or a bag of coins -- and they have also made it much easier to borrow money to support such positions. Margin calls no doubt had something to do with Monday's plunge, as they did with the collapse of silver futures back in 1980.
In 1980, a case could be made that those margin calls, in the futures market, were brought on by a conspiracy against the people who had driven prices up. An article in Fortune Magazine pointed to changes in the rules at the commodity exchange, making it all but impossible to speculate on silver prices continuing to rise. This time, there are no obvious changes in rules to explain the plunge. It may be that a lot of people simply placed bets with borrowed money, expecting a disaster that has not arrived, and now are scrambling to minimize their losses.
Perhaps, as in 1980, evidence is growing that the central bankers are getting it right -- or at least right enough. By coincidence, the day after the Monday plunge in gold, the International Monetary Fund released its World Economic Report, with a chapter titled "The dog that didn't bark: Has inflation been muzzled?" The chapter had a suitable quantity of "buts" and "howevers," but the basic answer was "Yes," in large part because people trust central bankers and assume that central bank inflation targets will be met, at least in the long run.
"Fears about high inflation should not prevent monetary authorities from pursuing highly accommodative monetary policy," the I.M.F. concluded.
It may be a coincidence, but this week's plunge coincided with growing publicity for a currency that sounds a little like gold, at least if you are not paying close attention. That is the digital currency called bitcoin, which has of late been more volatile than a dot-com stock in 1999. Invented in 2009, its supply supposedly is controlled by a rigid computer program, making it, like gold, not subject to central bank manipulation. It got an endorsement last week from The Economist magazine: "Regulators should keep their hands off new forms of digital money such as bitcoin," the magazine wrote, proclaiming that the bitcoin's "unique digital signature" makes it "impossible to forge."
To gold advocates, that kind of talk is dangerous.
"The bitcoin is not the answer to the Federal Reserve's depredations against the dollar," wrote Steve Forbes, a former presidential hopeful, in his blog at Forbes.com. "The basic reason: It has no fixed value. It trades like a stock or commodity. In recent days it has been crashing after a spectacular rise in terms of dollars. Such volatility makes it useless as a means to do transactions."
Of course, you could say something similar about gold.

Full text:   Are we moving from the crash to the bubble, dispensing with that pesky economic recovery thing altogether?
The Federal Reserve is well into its third round of "quantitative easing," in which it buys longer-term assets to bring down long-term lending rates. We are about five and a half years into the Fed's extraordinary monetary policies (its out-of-the-box lending programs began before the crash, in late 2007).
The effect the central bank hopes to produce hasn't materialized. Despite modest growth, the economy remains a wellspring of misery, with mass unemployment, wage stagnation and factories going unused. In March, a smaller percentage of working-age people were actually working than at any other time since 1979.
Through its unconventional policies, the Fed is trying to ease the crisis. It has succeeded in driving down lending rates. Ben S. Bernanke and company would also like to kindle inflation expectations, spurring people to buy and companies to invest today instead of waiting until tomorrow. Supposedly, all of this will drive a self-sustaining economic recovery.
Instead, the Fed has kindled speculation. Investors are desperate for yield and are paying up for riskier assets. In areas like real estate, structured finance and equities, the markets are ahead of the fundamentals. It doesn't look to me like a bubble yet. But I would call it the Dysplasia Stage, abnormal growth that looks precancerous.
It's not just an economic or financial issue, it's cultural and psychological. We seem to have unlearned what real growth is and simply substituted speculative bubbles. Policy makers are either paralyzed or barrel forward because this is all they know how to do.
Let's first take the stock market. On the standard measures of looking at estimated earnings, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index isn't particularly high. But that's misleading. Corporate earnings are extremely high as a percentage of the gross domestic product. Margins are high. Is that sustainable?
There are more reliable measures of stock market value, and they look frothy. One gauge, the price of stocks based on the past decade of earnings, is named after the Yale economist Robert J. Shiller. Using that, stocks are too expensive by 65 percent. Alternatively, many investors look at something called the Q, devised by the economist James Tobin, which compares stock prices with corporate net worth. The nonfinancial companies are overpriced by 57 percent. The stock market is not at 1999 or 1929 levels, but it has reached other previous peaks of 1906, 1936 and 1968, according to Smithers & Company, a London-based research shop.
To make stocks correctly priced, "either earnings have to explode heavenward for 10 years or else stock prices have to come in a lot," said Scott Frew, who runs Rockingham Capital Partners, a small hedge fund. He expects earnings to fall.
It's not just stocks. Investors are bidding up junk bonds, commercial mortgage-backed securities and bundles of corporate loans called collateralized loan obligations. Last month, investors were paying more for such loans than at any time in the last five years. They are snapping up billions of dollars in securities made up of subprime auto loans.
And the housing market isn't just rising, but roaring back so fast you can feel the G-force coming off the reports. Home prices in Phoenix went up 23 percent over the last year, according to the latest Standard & Poor's Case-Shiller index. More than one in four homes in Phoenix was purchased by an investor who bought more than five homes, up from 16 percent a year earlier.
"I am now starting to become less skeptical" about the worries over a new housing bubble, said Christopher J. Mayer, a real estate economist at Columbia University. When local money is on the sidelines and outside buyers come in to snap up real estate, that typically ends badly, he added.
So what's going on?
The Fed is engaged in "trickle-down monetary policy," said Daniel Alpert, managing partner of Westwood Capital, an investment bank. "This type of monetary policy is making the wealthy wealthier and hoping that it trickles down to the shop floor."
But "trickle down has never worked," he said. "The wealthy don't need to consume. And when there is oversupply of capacity, the wealthy don't need to invest in new capacity."
Has the Federal Reserve monetary policy reached the average American? To a certain degree, yes. Many Americans have been able to refinance their homes. Those auto loans may be helping people get to and from work.
But the economic effects are modest for the size and scope of the effort. Investors glory in the asset inflation. The most pronounced effect of low mortgage rates has been to allow people with good credit and low debt to refinance multiple times over the last few years. Stock ownership is concentrated among the wealthy; junk bonds and collateralized loan obligations only more so.
Mr. Alpert says the first round of quantitative easing was necessary to ease the liquidity problem in the markets -- the unwillingness of investors to conquer their fears and buy up assets. But the third round is "unnecessary," he said.
Others disagree. Dean Baker, an economist from the liberal-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research who warned about the housing bubble much earlier than most, doesn't see a bubble yet. He advocates continuing quantitative easing.
Mr. Baker adds a note of caution, however. Regulators should move to high alert; Federal Reserve officials should start speaking out to signal that they are paying attention to the abnormalities. Eric S. Rosengren, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, gave a recent speech raising areas of concern, only to dismiss them as not overly worrisome yet.
At least he was thinking about the issue. As with cancer, the key is to intervene early.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- A panel of former senior American officials and outside experts, including several who recently left the Obama administration, issued a surprisingly critical assessment of American diplomacy toward Iran on Wednesday, urging President Obama to become far more engaged and to reconsider the likelihood that harsh sanctions will drive Tehran to concessions.
In a report issued by the Iran Project, the former diplomats and experts suggested that the sanctions policy, rather than bolstering diplomacy, may be backfiring. As the pressure has increased, the group concluded, sanctions have "contributed to an increase in repression and corruption within Iran" and "may be sowing the seeds of long-term alienation between the Iranian people and the United States."
The critique comes as both Israel and Congress are urging the administration to go in the opposite direction, to put a sharp time limit on negotiations and, if necessary, to go beyond the financial and oil sanctions that have caused a tremendous drop in the value of the Iranian currency and sent inflation soaring.
"I fundamentally believe that the balance between sanctions and diplomacy has been misaligned," said Thomas R. Pickering, who was one of the State Department's highest-ranking career diplomats and whom the department has called on to head up important investigations, including one into the death last fall of the American ambassador to Libya.
In an interview, Mr. Pickering also contended that Mr. Obama should review the covert program against Iran -- which has included computer sabotage of its nuclear facilities -- to "stop anything that is peripheral, that is not buying us much time" in slowing Iran's progress. The report itself, however, says nothing about the sabotage effort, which has been a major element of the American strategy.
Mr. Pickering, who is such a towering figure in the State Department that a major program to train young diplomats is named for him, is not the only prominent signatory of the report. Others include Lee H. Hamilton, who was a leader of the commission on the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and serves on Mr. Obama's intelligence advisory board; Anne-Marie Slaughter, the director of policy planning during Mr. Obama's first term; and Ryan C. Crocker, who served in many prominent ambassadorial positions. Former Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, an early mentor to Mr. Obama in the Senate, was among the Republican signatories.
At the core of the difference in strategy are these questions: Are the increasing sanctions likely to harden Iran's position and convince its supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, that the president's real goal is overthrowing the current government? Or are they likely to convince the Iranians, eventually, that the price of continuing the country's nuclear program is simply too high, as Mr. Obama has argued?
So far, there is plenty of evidence that the sanctions are hurting Iran, but none that they are changing the course of the country's nuclear program. Still, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted this week to bolster sanctions, if necessary, and Israel has argued that the stalling of the most recent round of talks has offered only more proof that the Iranians are playing for time, seeking to expand their nuclear enrichment capacity while keeping the talks limping along.
Mr. Obama and his diplomats have insisted that the sanctions they have imposed are in support of diplomacy. A State Department spokeswoman, Jen Psaki, said in a statement that the administration was sticking with its approach.
"We just completed a series of diplomatic talks" with America's allies in dealing with Tehran, Ms. Psaki said, "including three recent rounds of meetings that included Iran." She said that "a dual track approach of rigorous sanctions and serious negotiations is the right approach. However, the onus is on Iran to take the next steps and move the process forward."

Full text:   WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- Consumer prices fell in March for the first time in four months and industrial production slipped, strengthening the argument for the Federal Reserve Board to maintain its monetary stimulus to speed up economic growth.
Other data released on Tuesday suggested that the housing market recovery was losing momentum, even though builders started work on new homes at an annual rate of more than one million units for the first time since June 2008.
"For the Fed, it's business as usual," said Millan Mulraine, senior economist at TD Securities. "There is not likely to be an acceleration in growth momentum that would cause them to shift their policy stance anytime soon."
The Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index edged down 0.2 percent last month as gasoline prices tumbled, unwinding some of February's 0.7 percent increase. Economists expected a flat reading.
Underscoring the benign inflation environment, consumer prices rose just 1.5 percent in the 12 months through March -- the smallest increase since July. Prices increased 2 percent year-on-year in February.
Stripping out volatile energy and food costs, the so-called core C.P.I. was up only 0.1 percent after gaining 0.2 percent in February. That lowered the 12-month increase to 1.9 percent in March from 2.0 percent in February.
A separate report from the Fed showed that production at the nation's factories decreased 0.1 percent after advancing 0.9 percent in February. The decline was fairly broad-based, with output dropping for primary metals and electronics. Automobile assembly, however, increased.
Despite the factory weakness, overall industrial production rose 0.4 percent last month, mainly because of a jump in utilities' output.
Economic data for January and February have suggested growth accelerated in the first quarter after activity almost stalled in the final three months of 2012.
But in a replay of the previous two years, the economy appears to have hit a speed bump at the end of the quarter, with data ranging from employment to retail sales and manufacturing weakening significantly in March.
Much of the weakness is blamed on higher taxes and deep government spending cuts put in place in Washington.
"We definitely see the second quarter slowing from the first in terms of overall growth across many of the sectors. Obviously, the drag from fiscal policy is playing into this a little bit," said Erik Johnson, senior United States economist at IHS Global Insight.
A third report from the Commerce Department showed that housing starts rose 7.0 percent last month to a 1.04 million-unit annual rate, the highest in nearly five years.
The increase in home building was driven by the volatile multifamily sector, while groundbreaking for single-family units fell. In addition, permits for future construction tumbled 3.9 percent -- reversing February's gain.
That suggested a slowdown in housing activity, coming on the heels of a report on Monday that showed a third consecutive decline in homebuilders' confidence in April.
"The decline in single starts and permits is consistent with recent hints the housing recovery has lost some momentum," said David Sloan, senior economist at 4Cast Ltd.

Full text:   9:02 p.m. | Updated
Gold prices tumbled 9 percent on Monday, the sharpest drop in 30 years, heightening fears that investors' faith in the safe haven has been shattered.
The steep fall in gold, after a slump on Friday, led a broader sell-off in commodities and stock markets. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 2.3 percent -- its sharpest one-day decline since early November. Crude oil prices fell to under $90 a barrel, and copper dropped to a 17-month low.
The catalyst was disappointment over Chinese growth, which has been a bright spot in a global economy marred by uneven recoveries and Europe's persistent debt problems.
A report on Monday showed that Chinese economic growth unexpectedly slowed to an annual pace of 7.7 percent in the first months of the year, from 7.9 percent at the end of 2012, suggesting that China's demand for industrial materials would soften.
Weak regional manufacturing data in the United States also weighed on the United States stock market, as did the explosions in Boston later in the day.
Still it was gold that took the market spotlight on Monday.
The price of the metal has been undergoing an extraordinary reversal from a decade-long rally. Since reaching a high of $1,888 an ounce in August 2011, gold has been on a downward slope. The decline picked up pace on Friday, when gold fell 4 percent, officially taking it into a bear market, which is defined as a 20 percent drop from its recent high.
The damage worsened on Monday, when the price of an ounce of gold dropped 9.35 percent, or $140.40, to $1,360.60 for the April contract -- the sharpest such one-day decline since February of 1983.
A number of banks, including Goldman Sachs, have recently lowered their forecasts for gold. But the recent drop has been greater than even the most pessimistic predictions.
"We've traded gold for nearly four decades and we've never ... ever... EVER... seen anything like what we've witnessed in the past two trading sessions," Dennis Gartman, a closely followed gold investor, wrote to clients on Monday.
The shift in gold's fortunes presents a moment of reckoning for many so-called gold bugs, who had expected their financial lodestar to continue moving up in response to the Federal Reserve's effort to stimulate the economy through bond-buying programs.
The assumption among gold bugs was that the flood of new money would cause inflation, making hard assets like gold more attractive. So far, though, there have been few signs of inflation taking root even as central banks in Japan and Europe have begun their own aggressive bond-buying programs.
"Gold has had all the reason in the world to be moving higher -- but it hasn't been able to do it," said Matt Zeman, a metals trader at Kingsview Financial. "The situation has not deteriorated the way that a lot of people thought it could."
The recent drop in gold prices has been partly attributed to signals from powerful members of the Fed that the central bank may begin to wind down its bond-buying programs. But the list of reasons to sell gold grows longer by the day. European politicians have indicated that Cyprus may need to sell off some of its gold holdings to pay for its bank bailout, which could lead other countries to do the same.
The market decline, like the decade-long run-up, has also been attributed to the new financial instruments that have made buying gold easier for a wide array of investors. The most prominent products are gold exchange-traded funds, which can be traded on stock exchanges, and which together hold as much gold as all but a few of the world's largest central banks.
Hedge funds have used gold E.T.F.'s to gain exposure to the precious metal, but have been selling them off en masse in recent weeks. The largest such exchange-traded fund, with the ticker symbol GLD, had its most active day ever on Monday.
"The exits are only so wide and there are too many people trying to leave all of the sudden," said Bart Melek, a commodity strategist at TD Securities.
Many gold analysts have said that the demand for physical gold is stronger than the demand for financial products linked to gold, like exchange-traded funds and futures contracts. But this has not been enough to prop up the market.
On Monday, the most obvious catalyst for the carnage was the disappointing Chinese economic data that led to talk that China will no longer need the same physical resources to expand.
In the commodities world, this did not hurt only gold. Silver dropped over 12 percent, platinum 5.6 percent and the benchmark oil contract was down 3.9 percent. Stock indexes fell 1.5 percent in Japan and 0.6 percent in England.
The S.& P. 500 dropped 2.3 percent, or 36.49 points, to 1,552.36 on Monday. The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 1.8 percent, or 265.86 points, at 14,599.20. The Nasdaq composite index fell 2.4 percent, or 78.46 points, to 3,216.49.
In the bond market, interest rates fell as investors shifted their money to less risky assets. The price of the Treasury's 10-year note rose 9/32, to 10226/32, while its yield dropped to 1.69 percent, from 1.72 percent late Friday.

Full text:   Bitcoin's wild ride may not have been the biggest business story of the past few weeks, but it was surely the most entertaining. Over the course of less than two weeks the price of the "digital currency" more than tripled. Then it fell more than 50 percent in a few hours. Suddenly, it felt as if we were back in the dot-com era.
The economic significance of this roller coaster was basically nil. But the furor over bitcoin was a useful lesson in the ways people misunderstand money -- and in particular how they are misled by the desire to divorce the value of money from the society it serves.
What is bitcoin? It's sometimes described as a way to make transactions online -- but that in itself would be nothing new in a world of online credit-card and PayPal transactions. In fact, the Commerce Department estimates that by 2010 about 16 percent of total sales in America already took the form of e-commerce.
So how is bitcoin different? Unlike credit card transactions, which leave a digital trail, bitcoin transactions are designed to be anonymous and untraceable. When you transfer bitcoins to someone else, it's as if you handed over a paper bag filled with $100 bills in a dark alley. And sure enough, as best as anyone can tell the main use of bitcoin so far, other than as a target for speculation, has been for online versions of those dark-alley exchanges, with bitcoins traded for narcotics and other illegal items.
But bitcoin evangelists insist that it's about much more than greasing the path for illicit transactions. The biggest declared investors in bitcoins are the Winklevoss brothers, wealthy twins who successfully sued for a share of Facebook and were made famous by the movie "The Social Network" -- and they make claims for the digital product similar to those made by goldbugs for their favorite metal. "We have elected," declared Tyler Winklevoss recently, "to put our money and faith in a mathematical framework that is free of politics and human error."
The similarity to goldbug rhetoric isn't a coincidence, since goldbugs and bitcoin enthusiasts -- bitbugs? -- tend to share both libertarian politics and the belief that governments are vastly abusing their power to print money. At the same time, it's very peculiar, since bitcoins are in a sense the ultimate fiat currency, with a value conjured out of thin air. Gold's value comes in part because it has nonmonetary uses, such as filling teeth and making jewelry; paper currencies have value because they're backed by the power of the state, which defines them as legal tender and accepts them as payment for taxes. Bitcoins, however, derive their value, if any, purely from self-fulfilling prophecy, the belief that other people will accept them as payment.
However, let's leave that strangeness on one side, along with the peculiar "mining" process -- actually a process of complex calculation -- used to add to the bitcoin stock. Instead, let's focus on the two huge misconceptions -- one practical, one philosophical -- that underlie both goldbugism and bitbugism.
The practical misconception here -- and it's a big one -- is the notion that we live in an era of wildly irresponsible money printing, with runaway inflation just around the corner. It's true that the Federal Reserve and other central banks have greatly expanded their balance sheets -- but they've done that explicitly as a temporary measure in response to economic crisis. I know, government officials are not to be trusted and all that, but the truth is that Ben Bernanke's promises that his actions wouldn't be inflationary have been vindicated year after year, while goldbugs' dire warnings of inflation keep not coming true.
The philosophical misconception, however, seems to me to be even bigger. Goldbugs and bitbugs alike seem to long for a pristine monetary standard, untouched by human frailty. But that's an impossible dream. Money is, as Paul Samuelson once declared, a "social contrivance," not something that stands outside society. Even when people relied on gold and silver coins, what made those coins useful wasn't the precious metals they contained, it was the expectation that other people would accept them as payment.
Actually, you'd expect the Winklevosses, of all people, to get this, because in a way money is like a social network, which is useful only to the extent that other people use it. But I guess some people are just bothered by the notion that money is a human thing, and want the benefits of the monetary network without the social part. Sorry, it can't be done.
So do we need a new form of money? I guess you could make that case if the money we actually have were misbehaving. But it isn't. We have huge economic problems, but green pieces of paper are doing fine -- and we should let them alone.

Full text:   CARACAS, Venezuela -- In an unexpectedly close race, Venezuelans narrowly voted to continue Hugo Chávez's revolution, electing his handpicked political heir, Nicolás Maduro, to serve the remainder of his six-year term as president, officials said late Sunday.
But the thin margin of victory could complicate the task of governing for Mr. Maduro, emboldening the political opposition and possibly undermining Mr. Maduro's stature within Mr. Chávez's movement.
His opponent, Henrique Capriles Radonski, refused to recognize the results, citing irregularities in the voting and calling for a recount.
Mr. Maduro, the acting president, narrowly defeated Mr. Capriles, a state governor who ran strongly against Mr. Chávez in October. Election authorities said that with more than 99 percent of the vote counted, Mr. Maduro had 50.6 percent to Mr. Capriles's 49.1 percent. More than 78 percent of registered voters cast ballots.
"These are the irreversible results that the Venezuelan people have decided with this electoral process," Tibisay Lucena, the head of the electoral council, said as she read the result on national television late Sunday.
Mr. Maduro gave a defiant speech that suggested little willingness to make concessions. "We have a just, legal, constitutional and popular electoral victory," he said.
Mr. Capriles was equally defiant. "We are not going to recognize the result until every vote is counted, one by one," Mr. Capriles said. "The big loser today is you, you and what you represent," he said, referring to Mr. Maduro.
Meanwhile, there were also signs that the strident, Chávez-style anti-American message that Mr. Maduro used during the campaign would now be set aside to improve Venezuela's strained relations with the United States.
Venezuela is a major oil supplier to the United States with immense reserves, and under Mr. Chávez it has also been a major thorn in Washington's side, wielding its oil and its diplomatic muscle to oppose American policy everywhere from Cuba to Syria. Mr. Chávez, who succumbed to cancer on March 5, built his political career on flaying the United States and its traditional allies in the Venezuelan establishment, and Mr. Maduro followed his mentor's script throughout the campaign with an acolyte's zeal.
He accused former American diplomats of plotting to kill him, suggested that the United States had caused Mr. Chávez's illness, and had his foreign minister shut the door on informal talks with the United States that began late last year. A senior State Department official in Washington said the harsh rhetoric had made the possibility of improved relations more difficult.
But over the weekend, with his election victory looking likely, Mr. Maduro sent a private signal to Washington that he was ready to turn the page. Bill Richardson, the former governor of New Mexico, who was in Caracas as a representative of the Organization of American States, said in an interview that Mr. Maduro called him aside after a meeting of election observers on Saturday and asked him to carry a message.
"He said, 'We want to improve the relationship with the U.S., regularize the relationship,' " Mr. Richardson said.
The foreign minister, Elías Jaua, met with Mr. Richardson on Sunday, and said Venezuela was ready to resume the talks that it had cut off, Mr. Richardson said.
Though Mr. Chávez's death raised the possibility of a realignment in the hemisphere, Mr. Maduro's victory would seem to extend the life of the leftist coalition of countries that coalesced around Mr. Chávez. Mr. Maduro seems certain to continue the lifeline of oil sales on preferential terms that Venezuela provides to Cuba, whose leaders were close allies of Mr. Chávez.
Yet even his supporters say that Mr. Maduro lacks his predecessor's sharp political instincts and magnetism, and many questions remain about how effectively he will lead at home and abroad.
At the voting booth on Sunday, Mr. Chávez was as much on voters' minds as the two candidates were. Mr. Maduro went all-out to associate himself with the dead leader and his idiosyncratic style of socialism, which remains broadly popular in Venezuela, especially among poorer voters. His image was everywhere in Mr. Maduro's campaign, and the candidate even told voters that Mr. Chávez's spirit had appeared to him in the form of a little bird. An awkward campaigner who struggled to connect with supporters, Mr. Maduro took to whistling like a bird at his rallies.
Voters seemed to respond on Sunday. "The commander's legacy should continue, toward a better future," said Alejandro Rodríguez, 34, after casting his ballot at a school in a neighborhood known as Gato Negro, or Black Cat. "I voted for the commander's son, Nicolás Maduro," Mr. Rodríguez said, echoing the candidate who called himself "the son of Chávez." Driving the point home, a large banner on a pedestrian overpass near the school entrance said, "A vote for Maduro is a vote for Chávez."
Just as he did when running against Mr. Chávez last October, Mr. Capriles managed to energize and inject hope into a fractious and battered opposition. He represented a coalition of groups from across the political spectrum. But it was not clear if the opposition's unity and momentum could be maintained after the defeat, in the face of a government that holds a virtual monopoly on power.
In the election last October, Mr. Chávez received nearly 8.2 million votes, or 55 percent, compared to nearly 6.6 million, or 44 percent, for Mr. Capriles.
But Mr. Maduro could also face pressure from within Mr. Chávez's movement, from competing leaders or groups in government and the armed forces who do not feel the need to obey him with the absolute loyalty they once gave to Mr. Chávez.
Just as Mr. Chávez did, Mr. Maduro sought to exploit the bitter divide between loyalists and opponents.
"The country is going to be more polarized, divided into two parts," said Rafael Huizi Clavier, a retired vice admiral who supported Mr. Capriles. "There is more confrontation, because the campaign has been very hard and the differences have been exacerbated. There is more antagonism between the two sides."
The new president will face a host of challenges as he serves out the rest of Mr. Chavez's term, which began in January. The economy suffers from high inflation -- just over 20 percent last year -- and from chronic shortages of many basic foods, medicines and other goods. Many economists predict that economic growth will slow significantly this year and some say the nation could slip into recession.
The government-owned oil monopoly, Petróleos de Venezuela, is a crucial source of government revenue, but it has been struggling with stagnant production and problems at its refineries. The country's electrical grid is plagued by blackouts, which are frequent in many areas of the country outside Caracas.
And violent crime is rampant. As recently as Thursday, four people were shot to death in three separate incidents at a sprawling election rally for Mr. Maduro in Caracas, according to local news media accounts.

Full text:   A four-day rally in the stock market came to an end on Friday as signs of a slowing economy rattled commodity markets, weighing down energy and mining companies.
The price of crude oil dropped 2 percent, to $91 a barrel, as weak United States economic reports followed forecasts for diminished demand for oil.
Gold plunged $64, to $1,501 an ounce, reaching its lowest level since July 2011.
One cause for the latest plunge was a government report that wholesale prices in the United States fell the most in 10 months in March. Traders tend to sell gold when inflation wanes. Traders also pushed gold prices lower on reports that Cyprus may sell some of its gold reserves, possibly prompting other weak European countries like Italy and Spain to do the same.
Compared with the commodities markets, the stock market looked stable. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped just 0.08 of a point to close at 14,865.06. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 4.52 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,588.85.
The two major indexes finished the week with strong gains: The Dow rose 2.1 percent, and the S.& P. 500 rose 2.3 percent.
David Joy, the chief market strategist for Ameriprise Financial, said it was as if the stock market was telling a different story from the bond and commodity markets.
Copper and other industrial metals slid along with gold on Friday, while Treasury yields sank near their lows for the year. He said the moves implied that traders in those markets were more worried about an economic slowdown.
"It gives me pause," Mr. Joy said. "Commodities and bonds are telling stock investors: don't be in such a hurry to say the U.S. economy is in great shape."
The sharp drop in gold futures tugged down mining companies. Barrick Gold shares lost 8.5 percent, to $22.62, Newmont Mining stock fell 5.9 percent, to $36.37, and Freeport-McMoRan shares fell 2.7 percent, to $31.92.
Materials and energy stocks fell the most of the 10 industry groups in the S.& P. 500, with materials stocks down 1.5 percent and energy shares off 1.3 percent.
The Nasdaq composite dropped 5.21 points, to 3,294.95, a fall of 0.2 percent.
A handful of reports issued Friday heightened concerns. Sales at retailers fell in March, and companies restocked their shelves at a much slower pace in February than in the month before. That is usually a sign that companies expect weaker spending from consumers and businesses. A measure of consumer sentiment from the University of Michigan also slumped.
Still, the stock market has held up well, leaving "a lot of investors scratching their heads," said Lawrence Creatura, a fund manager at Federated Investors.
This earnings season will most likely determine which direction the market takes, Mr. Creatura said. Next week, when Bank of America, Google and other big names turn in their quarterly results, could make the difference.
Wells Fargo reported stronger quarterly profits on Friday, but its revenue fell short of Wall Street's forecasts. The bank's stock lost 0.8 percent, to $37.21.
Treasury yields were near their lows for the year. The yield on the 10-year note dropped to 1.72 percent, from 1.79 percent late Thursday. The low point of the year, 1.69 percent, was reached April 5. The price rose
21/32, to 102 17/32.

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDEDPresident Obama is no longer pressing to raise income tax rates on the rich. But that doesn't mean he thinks the wealthy are paying enough in taxes.
Outlining his budget proposals to Congress on Wednesday, Mr. Obama pushed to raise more than $600 billion in new revenue, mainly by curbing deductions for the most affluent taxpayers and forcing million-dollar earners to pay a minimum rate of 30 percent. Under the White House plan, deductions for tax breaks like mortgage interest and contributions to charities would be capped at a maximum rate of 28 percent. The caps would limit the value of the breaks to the top 3 percent of taxpayers who face higher marginal tax rates and generate about $529 billion in additional revenue over 10 years.
Many of the budget proposals, including the limit on deductions, have been made before by the Obama administration. Analysts said Congress was unlikely to adopt them in isolation, but that some Republicans might be open to a broader deal that included measures to close various loopholes in the tax code.
Chuck Marr, director of federal tax policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said the main part of the tax proposal -- curbing tax deductions for high earners -- could form part of a future deal because they were close to what Republicans have themselves proposed in the past. "In any agreement that finally comes together this will be the core revenue piece of it," he said.
At the same time, the administration formally proposed the so-called Buffett Rule, which would impose a new minimum 30 percent tax rate on households earning incomes above $1 million. It said this could generate an additional $53 billion in revenue over a decade. It is named after Warren E. Buffett, the billionaire investor, who said in an Op-Ed article in The New York Times that he was paying a lower tax percentage than members of his office.
"This proposal will prevent high-income households from using tax preferences, including low tax rates on capital gains and dividends, to reduce their total tax bills to less than what many middle class families pay," according to the White House.
Roberton Williams, senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center in Washington, said the rule's inclusion in the budget proposal was an indication that the Obama administration was determined "to make sure that the rich people pay something."
Tax rates for high-earners were increased this year for the first time in two decades as part of the postelection deal to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff and to help pay for the cost of expanded health care coverage.
Despite those increases, the effective tax burden for the very wealthy remained considerably lower than in past decades, according to Emmanuel Saez, professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley. He estimated the recent tax increases could take the total average federal tax rate of the top 0.1 percent of earners to about 40 percent, compared with about 51 percent in 1981. The total tax take from that group had fallen to about 33 percent after the Bush tax cuts.
In its proposal, the Obama administration also proposed a $3 million limit on tax-deferred individual retirement accounts -- another tax measure aimed at wealthy individuals who have been accused of using the accounts to shelter large amounts of money rather than for simple savings.
The White House also proposed, as it has in the past, ending the preferential treatment of private equity and hedge fund profits, known as carried interest. These profits are currently taxed as a long-term capital gain.
The treatment of carried interest has for years been strongly defended by elements of the financial industry, and the White House proposal was quickly attacked on Wednesday by the leading private equity industry trade group. Even supporters of the proposal conceded that it faced stiff political opposition.
"Republicans are never going to sign off on this," said Andrew Fieldhouse, an analyst at the Economic Policy Institute.
While most of the proposed tax increases were aimed at higher earners, there were important proposals that would affect all individuals.
The administration proposed higher taxes on tobacco products to pay for early childhood education, raising about $78 billion over a decade.
Its plan for a new cost-of-living formula to reduce future Social Security benefits would also involve indexing income tax brackets to the different measure of inflation. This would effectively increase the money raised by the income tax across the board over the next decade, affecting "people throughout the income distribution," said Donald Marron, director of the Tax Policy Center.
President Obama said he was still committed to lowering the federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent. But he also wanted to close tax loopholes that allow many companies to pay a much lower effective corporate tax rate.
In the budget, he proposed eliminating special tax privileges for the oil, gas and coal industries to save a further $44 billion over 10 years, increased taxation of foreign earnings, and special rules for corporate jets.
The Business Roundtable, a lobbying group that represents major corporations, said it welcomed any cut in corporate taxes, but wanted the reductions to be part of broader reform, and objected to measures that aimed at particular industries.
"Singling out certain industries for taxation is bad tax policy," the group said in a statement.
Correction: April 13, 2013, Saturday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Thursday about President Obama's budget proposal to Congress referred imprecisely to those taxpayers who would pay a minimum federal income tax rate of 30 percent. That rate would apply to earnings above $1 million a year -- not to "millionaires," those with a net worth at that level.

Abstract: Below the streets of Lower Manhattan, in the vault of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the world's largest trove of gold -- half a million bars -- has lost about $75 billion of its value. [...]5 billion that flowed into gold-focused mutual funds in 2009 and 2010, according to Morningstar, helped the funds reach a peak value of $26.3 billion. Since hitting a peak in April 2011, those funds have lost half of their value.

Full text:   Below the streets of Lower Manhattan, in the vault of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the world's largest trove of gold -- half a million bars -- has lost about $75 billion of its value. In Fort Knox, Ky., at the United States Bullion Depository, the damage totals $50 billion.
And in Pocatello, Idaho, the tiny golden treasure of Jon Norstog has dwindled, too. A $29,000 investment that Mr. Norstog made in 2011 is now worth about $17,000, a loss of 42 percent.
"I thought if worst came to worst and the government brought down the world economy, I would still have something that was worth something," Mr. Norstog, 67, says of his foray into gold.
Gold, pride of Croesus and store of wealth since time immemorial, has turned out to be a very bad investment of late. A mere two years after its price raced to a nominal high, gold is sinking -- fast. Its price has fallen 17 percent since late 2011. Wednesday was another bad day for gold: the price of bullion dropped $28 to $1,558 an ounce.
It is a remarkable turnabout for an investment that many have long regarded as one of the safest of all. The decline has been so swift that some Wall Street analysts are declaring the end of a golden age of gold. The stakes are high: the last time the metal went through a patch like this, in the 1980s, its price took 30 years to recover.
What went wrong? The answer, in part, lies in what went right. Analysts say gold is losing its allure after an astonishing 650 percent rally from August 1999 to August 2011. Fast-money hedge fund managers and ordinary savers alike flocked to gold, that haven of havens, when the world economy teetered on the brink in 2009. Now, the worst of the Great Recession has passed. Things are looking up for the economy and, as a result, down for gold. On top of that, concern that the loose monetary policy at Federal Reserve might set off inflation -- a prospect that drove investors to gold -- have so far proved to be unfounded.
And so Wall Street is growing increasingly bearish on gold, an investment banks and others had deftly marketed to the masses only a few years ago. On Wednesday, Goldman Sachs became the latest big bank to predict further declines, forecasting that the price of gold would sink to $1,390 within a year, down 11 percent from where it traded on Wednesday. Société Générale of France last week issued a report titled, "The End of the Gold Era," which said the price should fall to $1,375 by the end of the year and could keep falling for years.
Granted, gold has gone through booms and busts before, including at least two from its peak in 1980, when it traded at $835, to its high in 2011. And anyone who bought gold in 1999 and held on has done far better than the average stock market investor. Even after the recent decline, gold is still up 515 percent.
But for a generation of investors, the golden decade created the illusion that the metal would keep rising forever. The financial industry seized on such hopes to market a growing range of gold investments, making the current downturn in gold felt more widely than previous ones. That triumph of marketing gold was apparent in an April 2011 poll by Gallup, which found that 34 percent of Americans thought that gold was the best long-term investment, more than another other investment category, including real estate and mutual funds.
It is hard to know just how much money ordinary Americans plowed into gold, given the array of investment vehicles, including government-minted coins, publicly traded commodity funds, mining company stocks and physical bullion. But $5 billion that flowed into gold-focused mutual funds in 2009 and 2010, according to Morningstar, helped the funds reach a peak value of $26.3 billion. Since hitting a peak in April 2011, those funds have lost half of their value.
"Gold is very much a psychological market," said William O'Neill, a co-founder of the research firm Logic Advisors, which told its investors to get out of all gold positions in December after recommending the investment for years. "Unless there is some unforeseen development, I think the market is going lower."
Gold's abrupt reversal has also been painful for companies that were cashing in on the gold craze. In the last year, two gold-focused mutual funds were liquidated after years of new fund openings, Morningstar data shows. Perhaps the most famous company to come out of the 2011 gold rush, the retail trading company Goldline, has drastically cut back its advertising on cable television, lowering spending to $3.7 million from $17.8 million in 2010, according to Kantar Media.
Goldline agreed to pay $4.5 million last year to settle charges brought by the city attorney of Santa Monica, Calif., accusing the company of running a bait-and-switch operation. Goldline did not respond to requests for comment for this article.
But the worst news for gold is probably good news for the broader economy, which, though still struggling to grow, has recovered from its lows.
"As the economy improves, the demand for gold as a financial hedge declines more than the fundamental demand for gold jewelry increases," said Daniel J. Arbess, a partner at Perella Weinberg Partners, who sold off his fund's large stake in gold in the fourth quarter of 2012.
Investment professionals, who have focused many of their bets on gold exchange-traded funds, or E.T.F.'s, have been faster than retail investors to catch wind of gold's changing fortune. The outflow at the most popular E.T.F., the SPDR Gold Shares, was the biggest of any E.T.F. in the first quarter of this year as hedge funds and traders pulled out $6.6 billion, according to the data firm IndexUniverse. Two prominent hedge fund managers who had taken big positions in gold E.T.F.'s, George Soros and Louis M. Bacon, sold in the last quarter of 2012, according to recent regulatory filings.
"Gold was destroyed as a safe haven, proved to be unsafe," Mr. Soros said in an interview last week with The South China Morning Post of Hong Kong. "Because of the disappointment, most people are reducing their holdings of gold."
Gold's most vocal bulls say gold doubters are losing faith too easily. Peter Schiff, the chief executive of the investment firm Euro Pacific Capital, said that he still expected gold to hit $5,000 an ounce within a few years because, he said, the world is headed for a period of dangerous hyperinflation.
"People believe the U.S. economy is recovering. It's not," said Mr. Schiff.
The most famous investor who is standing by gold is John Paulson, the hedge fund manager who made a fortune betting against the American housing market. His $900 million gold fund reportedly dropped 26 percent in the first two months of this year.
Mr. Paulson's losses were particularly severe because he bet heavily on gold mining companies, which have fallen more sharply than gold itself.
Mr. Norstog, in Pocatello, made a similar mistake. He put his money in a gold fund that was focused on mining company stocks.
"If I had to do it all over again, I would have just bought the gold," Mr. Norstog said. "At least that way I could have run my fingers through the glittering coins."

Full text:   Global growth is likely to remain tepid this year and central banks should keep their easy monetary policies in place, the head of the International Monetary Fund said on Wednesday.
"Thanks to the actions of policy makers, the economic world no longer looks quite as dangerous as it did six months ago," Christine Lagarde, the I.M.F. managing director, told the Economic Club of New York.
While there were signs that financial conditions were improving, Ms. Lagarde said those changes were not translating into improvements in the real economy.
"In present circumstances, it makes sense for monetary policy to do the heavy lifting in this recovery by remaining accommodative," Ms. Lagarde said.
"We know that inflation expectations are well anchored today, giving central banks greater leeway to support growth," she added.
She said a three-speed recovery was under way, led by fast-growing emerging economies, followed by countries like the United States that are on the mend, and with the euro zone and Japan trailing.
In January, the I.M.F. trimmed its 2013 forecast for global growth to 3.5 percent from 3.6 percent, and projected a 4.1 percent expansion in 2014. It said the world economy grew 3.2 percent in 2012.
Ms. Lagarde said the exceptionally loose monetary policies of central banks in advanced economies was a concern for emerging economies, which fear a sudden reversal of the large capital flows that have flooded their economies in recent years as investors have sought higher yields.
"Right now, these risks appear under control," Ms. Lagarde said, but she urged emerging economies to increase their defenses to deal with possible repercussions when the Federal Reserve and other central banks start to cut back their monetary stimulus.

Abstract: In August, Jesús Silva Herzog, Mexico's finance minister, flew to Washington to tell Paul Volcker at the Federal Reserve and Donald Regan at the Treasury Department that Mexico could not make its coming payments to American and other foreign banks. In Mexico's case, runaway government spending in the 1970s, fueled by high oil prices and greased by foreign debt, threatened to bankrupt the country after the Fed sharply raised interest rates to curb rampant inflation in the United States, increasing Mexico's interest payments even as oil prices crashed to earth.

Full text:   I was in Mexico City in the summer of 1981, just out of high school, when Mexico's president, José López Portillo, announced he would defend the peso "like a dog" against speculative attacks.
His approach to economics was unorthodox but creative. He tried to raise oil prices by sheer force of will -- firing the director of the state oil company Pemex for having the temerity to reduce the price of Mexican crude as oil plummeted on international markets. He froze dollar accounts in local banks to try to stem capital flight.
But the canine defense didn't work. In 1982, interest on foreign debt swallowed almost two-thirds of the country's export revenue. In February, Mexico's currency started plummeting. In August, Jesús Silva Herzog, Mexico's finance minister, flew to Washington to tell Paul Volcker at the Federal Reserve and Donald Regan at the Treasury Department that Mexico could not make its coming payments to American and other foreign banks.
Tweak a few of the details and Mexico in the 1980s looks a lot like most Southern European countries today. In Mexico's case, runaway government spending in the 1970s, fueled by high oil prices and greased by foreign debt, threatened to bankrupt the country after the Fed sharply raised interest rates to curb rampant inflation in the United States, increasing Mexico's interest payments even as oil prices crashed to earth.
Similarly, money poured into Spain and Greece when investors persuaded themselves that the bonds of all members of the euro zone should be as safe as Germany's, the region's most creditworthy country. In Greece, this allowed a government spending binge. In Spain it ignited a housing bubble. Both countries were left with an unbearable burden when the world economy hit a wall, creditors took flight and the money stopped.
European decision-making during the crisis of the last few years also shares some of the erratic nature of Mexican policy under President López Portillo. Cyprus was somehow allowed to threaten the euro area's banking system. European leaders then "solved" the problem by imposing capital controls that -- like those tried by Mexico -- are unlikely to work and will undoubtedly provide new headaches down the road.
But the most relevant parallel is one that European leaders refuse to see. If there is one overwhelming lesson from the debt crisis that struck Mexico and other Latin American countries so hard three decades ago, it is that countries that cannot grow will not pay. It is up to creditors, too, to allow them to grow. It took Mexico and its lenders seven years to figure that out. The European crisis is in its fifth year. You would think they might have learned something by now, but no.
Mexicans remember what happened after Mr. Silva Herzog's flight to Washington as the "lost decade." Miguel de la Madrid, who took over as president the following December, promised deep budget cuts in exchange for bridge loans and debt rescheduling. That didn't work, so Mexico cut a new deal, getting new loans from commercial banks, the United States and the International Monetary Fund, in exchange for cutting government payrolls and subsidies, selling state-run companies and opening the country to foreign trade.
I started college a little before Mr. Silva Herzog's trip. In the five-plus years it took me to get a degree (Mexican degrees take longer) the Mexican economy contracted about 2 percent. By the time I got my graduate degree two years later, gross domestic product per person was 8 percent less than it was in 1982. Yet despite the enforced austerity, Mexico's foreign debt in 1988 still amounted to 56.5 percent of Mexico's economic output, more than it had six years before.
This must sound familiar to Europe's unemployed. If anything it's far worse there. The Greek economy has shrunk more than a fifth over the last five years. Government debt amounts to about 170 percent of the economy; it was 100 percent when the crisis started. The economies of Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Italy are smaller, too, than they were five years ago. Their debt burden is heavier. And still, European leaders insist that more of the same must be the solution.
Charles Dallara -- who earlier this year stepped down as the head of the Institute of International Finance, the lobbying group for multinational banks -- despairs of the depth of austerity imposed on Europe's debtor countries by its creditors in Berlin and Brussels.
Having worked on Latin America's debt problems at the Treasury Department and the International Monetary Fund throughout the 1980s, he has a keen sense of what did not work. "They do not understand the flaws in their approach," he told me. "It is fraying the fabric of democracy."
But Latin America suggests there could be light at the end of the European debt tunnel, if only policy makers there could learn from previous experience.
Mexico's creditors performed a U-turn. Michel Camdessus, the head of the monetary fund then, became convinced that countries willing to continue economic reforms had to "count on a more adequate alleviation of the present drag of debt-service payments on their adjustment efforts."
Staring at the prospect of an imminent Mexican default that could have sunk some big American banks, Nicholas Brady, the newly minted Treasury secretary, prepared a plan for banks to reduce Mexico's debts on a "voluntary" basis instead. "The problem was too much debt," Mr. Brady told me. "The solution to too much debt is not more debt."
In 1990, the deal was concluded by the Mexican government of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. Strong-armed by the Treasury Department and the monetary fund, banks swapped old Mexican debt for Brady bonds backed by United States Treasuries that offered a reduction in principal, below-market interest rates or new money. Mexico's economy expanded by 4 percent, the strongest growth since 1981. The Brady plan became the template for debt reduction across Latin America and beyond.
What can Europe learn from this experience? Proponents of austerity will probably note that the harsh years planted some of the seeds of Mexico's recovery. Bankers will remark that Mexico's absolute debt reduction package was small -- much less than the 50 percent or so already granted to Greece. Economists will note that Mexico had a degree of freedom that no member of the euro area has: it could devalue its currency to gain export competitiveness.
Nonetheless, the Brady plan was a crucial ingredient. It not only reduced Mexico's interest costs, it also produced a jolt of confidence that pushed down domestic interest rates and buoyed the peso -- reducing the burden of foreign debt. It prompted flight capital to return to the country and set off an investment boom.
Yet perhaps the most important lesson to be had about the dynamics of economic crises and relief is about what it takes to motivate the political will to act.
To some extent, we owe the Brady plan to the cold war. Political unrest simmered across Latin America. In 1988, Mexican voters almost ousted the party that had ruled the country since 1929. The region, Washington feared, risked falling into Soviet clutches. Arizona's governor, Bruce Babbitt, even called Mexico "the ultimate domino."
Lt. Col. John C. Mangels, studying at the Air War College in 1988, caught the flavor of thinking at the time. "A financially devastated and chaotic Mexico would strongly interfere with our ability to maintain an East-West balance," he wrote. "The long-term security threat from Mexico thus hinges on economics."
In a speech almost three years ago, Mr. Brady asked himself whether something like the Brady plan could work now. "I'm not sure," he answered. "The level of cooperation I've described doesn't happen by chance, or easily."
So far, Southern Europe's 1930s-style depression has done little to sway Europe's paymasters in Berlin. But the quagmire across the southern tier could rend Europe as deeply as the Iron Curtain divided East and West. Isn't it time for another U-turn?

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDEDMargaret Thatcher, the "Iron Lady" of British politics, who set her country on a rightward economic course, led it to victory in the Falklands war and helped guide the United States and the Soviet Union through the cold war's difficult last years, died on Monday in London. She was 87.
Her spokesman, Tim Bell, said she died of a stroke at the Ritz Hotel. She had been in poor health for months and had suffered from dementia.
Prime Minister David Cameroncut short a visit to Continental Europe to return to Britain after receiving the news, andQueen Elizabeth II authorized a ceremonial funeral with military honors -- a notch below a state funeral -- at St. Paul's Cathedral in London. A statement from the White House said that "the world has lost one of the great champions of freedom and liberty, and America has lost a true friend."
Mrs. Thatcher was the first woman to become prime minister of Britain and the first to lead a major Western power in modern times. Hard-driving and hardheaded, she led her Conservative Party to three straight election wins and held office for 11 years -- May 1979 to November 1990 -- longer than any other British politician in the 20th century.
The strong economic medicine she administered to a country sickened by inflation, budget deficits and industrial unrest brought her wide swings in popularity, culminating with a revolt among her own cabinet ministers in her final year and her shout of "No! No! No!" in the House of Commons to any further integration with Europe.
But by the time she left office, the principles known as Thatcherism -- the belief that economic freedom and individual liberty are interdependent, that personal responsibility and hard work are the only ways to national prosperity, and that the free-market democracies must stand firm against aggression -- had won many disciples. Even some of her strongest critics accorded her a grudging respect.
At home, Mrs. Thatcher's political successes were decisive. She broke the power of the labor unions and forced the Labour Party to abandon its commitment to nationalized industry, redefine the role of the welfare state and accept the importance of the free market.
Abroad, she won new esteem for a country that had been in decline since its costly victory in World War II. After leaving office, she was honored as Baroness Thatcher of Kesteven. But during her first years in power, even many Tories feared that her election might prove a terrible mistake.
In October 1980, 17 months into her first term, Mrs. Thatcher faced disaster. More businesses were failing and more people were out of work than at any time since the Great Depression. Racial and class tensions smoldered. Even her close advisers worried that her push to stanch inflation, sell off nationalized industry and deregulate the economy was devastating the poor, undermining the middle class and courting chaos.
At the Conservative Party conference that month, the moderates grumbled that they were being led by a free-market ideologue oblivious to life on the street and the exigencies of realpolitik. With electoral defeat staring them in the face, cabinet members warned, now was surely a time for compromise.
To Mrs. Thatcher, they could not be more wrong. "I am not a consensus politician," she said. "I am a conviction politician."
In an address to the party, she played on the title of Christopher Fry's popular play "The Lady's Not for Burning" in insisting that she would press forward with her policies. "You turn if you want to," she told the faltering assembly. "The lady's not for turning."
Her resolve did the trick. A party revolt was thwarted, the Tories hunkered down, and Mrs. Thatcher went on to achieve great victories. She turned the Conservatives, long associated with the status quo, into the party of reform. Her policies revitalized British business, spurred industrial growth and swelled the middle class.
But her third term was riddled with setbacks. Dissension over monetary policy, taxes and Britain's place in the European Community caused her government to give up hard-won gains against inflation and unemployment. By the time she was ousted in another Tory revolt -- this one over her resistance to expanding Britain's role in a European Union -- the economy was in a recession and her reputation tarnished.
To her enemies she was -- as Denis Healey, chancellor of the Exchequer in Harold Wilson's government, called her -- "La Pasionaria of Privilege," a woman who railed against the evils of poverty but who was callous and unsympathetic to the plight of the have-nots. Her policies, her opponents said, were cruel and shortsighted, widened the gap between rich and poor and worsened the plight of the poorest.
Mrs. Thatcher's relentless hostility to the Soviet Union and her persistent call to modernize Britain's nuclear forces fed fears of nuclear war and even worried moderates in her own party. It also caught the Kremlin's attention. After she gave a hard-line speech in 1976, the Soviet press gave her a sobriquet of which she was proud: the Iron Lady.
Yet when she saw an opening, Mrs. Thatcher proved willing to bend. She was one of the first Western leaders to recognize that the Soviets would soon be led by a member of a new generation,Mikhail S. Gorbachev, and invited him to Britain in December 1984, three months before he came to power. "I like Mr. Gorbachev," she said. "We can do business together."
Her rapport with the new Soviet leader and her friendship with PresidentRonald Reaganmade Mrs. Thatcher a vital link between the White House and the Kremlin in their tense negotiations to halt the arms race of the 1980s.
Brisk and argumentative, she was rarely willing to concede a point and loath to compromise. Colleagues who disagreed with her were often deluged in a sea of facts, or what many referred to as being "handbagged."
"She had high standards, and she expected everyone to do their work," John O'Sullivan, a special adviser to the prime minister, recalled in 1999. "But there was a distinction. She was tougher on her ministers than she was on her personal staff. The more humble the position, the nicer she was."
Though she was the first woman to lead a major political party in the West, she rubbed many feminists the wrong way. "The battle for women's rights has largely been won," she declared. "I hate those strident tones we hear from some women's libbers." She relished being impolitic. "You don't follow the crowd," she said. "You make up your own mind."
The arts and academic establishments loathed her for cutting their financing and called her tastes provincial, her values narrow-minded. In 1985, two years into her second term, she was proposed for an honorary doctorate at Oxford, a laurel traditionally offered prime ministers who had attended the university, as she had. The proposal, after a faculty debate, was rejected.
Yet her popularity remained high.
"Margaret Thatcher evoked extreme feelings," wrote Ronald Millar, a playwright and speechwriter for the prime minister. "To some she could do no right, to others no wrong. Indifference was not an option. She could stir almost physical hostility in normally rational people, while she inspired deathless devotion in others."
The Grocer's Daughter
Margaret Hilda Roberts was born on Oct. 13, 1925, in Grantham, Lincolnshire, 100 miles north of London. Her family lived in a cold-water flat above a grocery store owned by her father, Alfred, the son of a shoemaker. Alfred Roberts was also a Methodist preacher and local politician, and he and his wife, Beatrice, reared Margaret and her older sister, Muriel, to follow the tenets of Methodism: personal responsibility, hard work and traditional moral values.
Margaret learned politics at her father's knee, joining him as he campaigned for alderman and borough councilman as an independent. "Politics was in my bloodstream," she said.
She won a scholarship to Kesteven and Grantham Girls School. In 1943, at 17, she was admitted to Somerville College, Oxford, to study chemistry. Barred from joining the Oxford Union debating society -- it did not admit women until 1963 -- she became a member of the Oxford University Conservative Association and its president in 1946. She graduated in 1947 and earned a master's degree in chemistry, then worked as a chemical researcher and studied law.
Entering politics, she was selected at 23 to be a Conservative candidate for Parliament, and in 1949 she met Denis Thatcher, a well-to-do businessman and former artillery officer who had been decorated for bravery during World War II. They married in December 1951. In August 1953, Mrs. Thatcher gave birth to twins, Mark and Carol, who survive her, along with grandchildren. (Sir Denis died in 2003.) That December, she was admitted to the bar and came to specialize in patent and tax law.
As the couple prospered, Mrs. Thatcher gained the financial independence to devote herself to politics. "Being prime minister is a lonely job," she wrote in her memoir, "The Downing Street Years" (1993). "It has to be; you cannot lead from the crowd. But with Denis there, I was never alone."
In 1950 she campaigned to be a member of Parliament from Dartford, a Labour Party preserve. She was the youngest woman to run for a seat that year, a time when Prime Minister Clement Attlee, who had oustedWinston Churchillin an upset on July 5, 1945, was seeking re-election. Mr. Attlee had gone on to create a welfare state that promised full employment, state ownership of industry, public housing and a national health service. As expected, Mrs. Thatcher was defeated. She ran again the next year, and lost, but she did better than expected in both races.
In 1951 the Tories began a 13-year run as the party in power, first under the aging Churchill and then under Anthony Eden, Harold Macmillan and Alec Douglas-Home. But in exchange for support on foreign affairs, the Tories compromised with the unions and accepted the government's growing role in the marketplace. This "policy of consensus" was successful. Mr. Macmillan, seeking re-election in 1959, said, "Most people have never had it so good."
Few Tories dared voice misgivings as inflation spread, productivity dropped and deficits grew. Mrs. Thatcher, elected to the House of Commons that year from the largely middle-class Finchley district in north London, was among those who swallowed their doubts.
In 1964, the Tories, exhausted by scandal, a souring economy and internal divisions, lost power to Harold Wilson's Labour Party. But as the economy grew more feeble and the unions more militant, Mr. Wilson was ousted in 1970 by the Conservative leader,Edward Heath. He appointed Mrs. Thatcher secretary for education.
As a Conservative cabinet minister, she fought budget cuts in the university system and pushed to rebuild schools in poor areas with a zeal, as Hugo Young wrote in his critical 1989 biography, "The Iron Lady,"that "would have done credit to the best of the socialists."
But it was her effort to restrict a free-milk program for schoolchildren that made her a national figure. Though poor children were exempt from the cutbacks, and the previous Labour government had also reduced free milk in schools, the opposition leapt to the attack. When Mrs. Thatcher argued in Parliament that the cuts would help finance more worthwhile programs, she was jeered. The tabloids labeled her "Thatcher the Milk Snatcher." Her children were taunted at school. Her husband, worried, suggested that perhaps she should quit politics.
The government stood firm on the milk issue. But as the economy worsened, Mr. Heath retreated, imposing wage and price controls as inflation surged and igniting strikes. His U-turn angered the Tory right. Moreover, it proved futile. In the wake of the 1973 Arab-Israeli war, the oil-producing nations of OPEC imposed huge price increases that stoked inflation. By winter 1974 Mr. Wilson was back in power.
The following December, the Conservative Party revised its rules for choosing a leader and opened a series of votes to the rank and file. Mrs. Thatcher, in what many regarded as an act of political gall, declared her candidacy. One British bookmaker, Ladbrokes, put the odds against her at 50 to 1.
Mrs. Thatcher finished ahead of Mr. Heath on the first ballot, 130 to 119. It was not enough for victory, but Mr. Heath was forced to drop out. In the second ballot, on Feb. 11, 1975, Mrs. Thatcher defeated the other contenders, all of them men.
For the next four years, as Labour ran the country, she fought to reshape her party. The conservatism she espoused was guided by the tenets of classic liberalism: faith in the individual, in economic freedom and in limited government power. But she had to contend with conservatism's basic reluctance to change with the times.
As the party of tradition, the Tories had little place for women in its upper echelons. All party leaders, for example, joined the Carlton Club, which excluded women. The club would not change its rules for Mrs. Thatcher, but she was accorded an honorary membership. Still, resentment lingered. At a party conference Mr. Heath studiously ignored her.
Mrs. Thatcher's prescription for change was based on the ideas of the conservative economists Friedrich von Hayek andMilton Friedman. Hayek believed that political and economic freedom were inseparable; Friedman argued that economic productivity and inflation were determined by the amount of money the government put into the economy, and that the heavy government spending advocated by Keynesian economics distorted the natural strength of the marketplace.
Mrs. Thatcher and her allies asserted that the Tory policy of consensus had allowed the country to lurch leftward as each successive leader, seeking the middle of the road, was forced to compromise with a leftist agenda. For her part, she cared little for theories. She called for an all-out attack on inflation, pledged to denationalize basic industry and promised to curb union power.
By the mid-1970s, Britain was the sick man of Europe. Nearly half of the average taxpayer's income went to the state, which now determined compensation for a third of the nation's work force: those employed by nationalized industries. In late 1978 and early '79, strikes paralyzed Britain. As the "winter of discontent" dragged on, Prime Minister James Callaghan, of the Labour Party, failed to survive a no-confidence vote and called an election for May 3.
Callaghan, who was known as Sunny Jim, drew higher personal ratings in opinion polls than Mrs. Thatcher. But on election day the Tories walked away with 43.9 percent of the vote. Labour received 37 percent and the Liberals 13.8 percent. It was the largest swing to the right in postwar history.
First Term
Mrs. Thatcher moved swiftly. "I came to office with one deliberate intent," she later said. "To change Britain from a dependent to a self-reliant society, from a give-it-to-me to a do-it-yourself nation."
It was a painful beginning. Income tax cuts balanced by rising gasoline duties and sales taxes fueled inflation. Unemployment spread as she slashed subsidies to faltering industries. Tight money policies drove up interest rates to as high as 22 percent, strengthening the pound, hobbling investment at home and hurting competitiveness overseas. A record 10,000 businesses went bankrupt. Saying it would take years to cure Britain of the havoc wrought by socialism, Mrs. Thatcher warned, "Things will get worse before they get better."
In the summer of 1981 -- the same one in which Charles, the Prince of Wales, married Lady Diana Spencer-- discontent boiled over into days of rioting in the London district of Brixton; the inner cities of Liverpool, Manchester and Bristol; and many other areas. Televised reports of rioting, arson and looting shocked the nation. The prime minister, resisting advisers who counseled more social spending and jobs programs, called for greater police powers. Yet, in the face of national shame over the violence, she was forced to give way.
There were other compromises. Retreating from its declaration that state industries must sink or swim in the free market, the government came to the aid of British Airways and British Steel.
Mrs. Thatcher later said that 1981 was her worst year in office. But by the spring of 1982, things were looking up. Inflation was falling; so was the value of the pound, which gave a boost to Britain's exports and, along with tax cuts, began to feed economic growth.
In foreign affairs, she won some small victories. Standing up to the European Community, she argued that her country paid out much more to the organization than it got back in benefits, and won a significant reduction in contributions. Though her rhetoric and style had caught the world's eye, she had yet to stake a position as a world leader. Then, on April 2, 1982, Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands.
British settlers had lived on those remote islands in the South Atlantic, long claimed by Argentina, since the 1820s, and negotiations over their future had been dragging on for years. The Argentine military junta under Gen. Leopoldo Galtieri, eager to divert attention from economic and social unrest, moved to take the Falklands by force, gambling that once the islands were occupied, Argentine forces would never be ousted.
As the United States and other allies pushed for talks to avoid bloodshed, Mrs. Thatcher ordered a Royal Navy fleet to the South Atlantic. In a 10-week war, the British retook the islands in fighting that left some 250 British servicemen and more than 1,000 Argentines dead. The victory doomed Argentina's military government and cemented Mrs. Thatcher's reputation as a leader to be reckoned with.
Second Term
Her political fortunes were enhanced by squabbling among her opponents. Far-left factions and militant union leaders were gaining strength in the Labour Party as economic discontent and tensions with the Soviet Union grew.
In 1980, Mrs. Thatcher and PresidentJimmy Carterhad agreed to deploy American intermediate-range cruise missiles in Britain in response to a Soviet buildup in Eastern Europe. Under Mr. Reagan, who succeeded Mr. Carter the next year, the United States, with Mrs. Thatcher's support, persuaded other European allies to deploy the missiles. The arms buildups ignited demonstrations across Western Europe.
When Mrs. Thatcher called an election in June 1983, Labour's new chief, Michael Foot, campaigned for a unilateral ban on nuclear weapons, withdrawal from the European Community, further nationalization of industry and a huge jobs program.
Mr. Foot's turn to the left alienated Labour's center and right wing, and this time the bookmakers put the odds heavily in Mrs. Thatcher's favor, and they had no regrets. The conservatives won 397 of the 650 seats in Parliament, the biggest swing in voting since Labour's landslide victory against Churchill in 1945. The working class voted heavily for the Conservatives.
It was an axiom of British politics that one never picked a quarrel with the pope or the National Union of Mineworkers. Mrs. Thatcher flouted it. The coal mines, nationalized in 1947, were widely seen as unprofitable, overstaffed and obsolescent, and in 1984 the government announced plans to shut down several mines and to eliminate 20,000 of the industry's 180,000 jobs.
In response, Arthur Scargill, the Marxist president of the union, used union rules to elude a rank-and-file vote and, on March 6, 1984, called a walkout.
It was a violent strike. Night after night, the television news broadcast images of hundreds of miners battling the police. On Nov. 30, at a mine in South Wales, a taxi driver taking a miner to work was fatally injured when a concrete slab was dropped on his cab.
Though the episode shocked the Labour Party and many miners, Mr. Scargill refused to condemn it, alienating Neil Kinnock, the new Labour leader, and other supporters. As members of his own union sought to have the strike declared illegal, newspaper cartoons pictured Mr. Scargill flinching under Mrs. Thatcher's flailing handbag. The strike finally ended in March 1985, after 362 days, without a settlement.
'Popular Capitalism'
Mrs. Thatcher now pushed harder to fulfill her vision of "popular capitalism." The sale of state-owned industries shifted some 900,000 jobs into the private sector. More than one million public housing units were sold to their occupants. And the chancellor of the Exchequer, Nigel Lawson, announced in 1985 that for the first time since the 1960s, the Treasury would not require deficit spending in its next fiscal budget.
Across the Atlantic, Mr. Reagan cheered Britain's turnaround. He and Mrs. Thatcher did not always agree; he thought she was too reluctant on cutting taxes, while she was wary of his insouciance over rising federal deficits. When Mr. Reagan, without warning the British, ordered troops to invade the Caribbean nation of Grenada, a member of the Commonwealth, in the wake of a Communist coup, Mrs. Thatcher gave him a dressing down. Nevertheless, the Reagan-Thatcher axis was, in the words of Hugo Young, "the most enduring personal alliance in the Western world throughout the 1980s."
The prime minister supported Mr. Reagan's stand against Communism, echoing White House assertions that Fidel Castro's Cuba was exporting revolution to Nicaragua and other Latin American states. She was equally vigorous in supporting the United States' fight against terrorism. In April 1986, after terrorist attacks in Western Europe, the United States sought permission to launch American warplanes from bases in Britain for attacks on Libya. Mrs. Thatcher granted it. The bombing destroyed the living quarters of the Libyan leader, Col.Muammar el-Qaddafi. Mrs. Thatcher's support for the mission outraged many Britons. But she said that terrorism demanded a united response.
Mrs. Thatcher had shown similar resolve at the Conservative Party conference in Brighton in 1984. On the evening of Oct. 12, as she worked on a speech in her hotel room, a bomb exploded on the floor below, killing four people and wounding more than 30. Among the dead was the wife of the Tories' chief whip, John Wakeham. A cabinet minister, Norman Tebbit, and his wife were wounded. The Irish Republican Army claimed responsibility. The next day Mrs. Thatcher addressed the party as planned, declaring, "All attempts to destroy democracy by terrorism will fail."
Despite the sectarian violence, Northern Ireland was not high on her agenda. Mrs. Thatcher saw the troubles there as intractable and her policies as simply preserving the status quo.
She was more flexible over South Africa, where the struggle against institutionalized racism was growing more violent. Though she regarded apartheid as repugnant, she initially refused to impose economic sanctions on South Africa, arguing that apartheid would ultimately be undone by greater trade and the prosperity and yearnings for democracy that come with it. But pressured by other Commonwealth countries, she grudgingly reversed herself.
On another problem involving the British Empire's complex legacy, Mrs. Thatcher had more success, at least at first. In 1984, Britain reached an agreement with China over the fate of Hong Kong, which was to revert to China in 1997. Under a formula of "one country, two systems," the political freedoms and economic structure of Britain's wealthiest colony would stand for 50 years, preserving Hong Kong's capitalist economy under a Communist state.
But in the turmoil after the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989, China, fearing a democratic Hong Kong's influence on the mainland, was far less amenable to granting the territory representative government. When the British governor, Chris Patten, handed over the colony to China in 1997, Hong Kong's political future remained uncertain.
The Cold War's End
"Some of these diplomatic minuets you have to go through I cannot stand," Mrs. Thatcher once said, by way of paying a compliment to Mr. Gorbachev. He forsook rhetoric for blunt realism, she said, and "that suits me better."
In the 1980s, the Soviet Union was rife with political disillusion and economic chaos. The Reagan administration sought to add pressure by moving ahead with high-tech weapons, including plans for the Strategic Defense Initiative, the space-based defense system known as Star Wars, which would in theory enable the United States to intercept incoming nuclear missiles.
Mr. Gorbachev was unalterably opposed to Star Wars, as were many in the West. Mrs. Thatcher was also against it, though she publicly supported it. At a White House meeting she warned that the project was a costly pipe dream. "I am a chemist," she is said to have told the president. "I know it won't work."
But she changed her mind after being assured that Britain would receive a goodly share of the business in researching and developing the system. At a meeting in Washington in December 1984, she helped draft a position on Star Wars, later adopted by Mr. Reagan, that assured the Soviets that the program would enhance nuclear deterrence, not undercut it, and that it would not get in the way of arms control talks.
Nevertheless, it did. During a summit meeting in Reykjavik, Iceland, in October 1986, Mr. Reagan and Mr. Gorbachev came close to an agreement to ban nuclear weapons altogether. But when Mr. Gorbachev insisted first on an American promise to drop the Strategic Defense Initiative, Mr. Reagan refused, and the negotiations fell apart.
The president's position infuriated his critics. But many people in NATO and the Pentagon were relieved. "The fact is that nuclear weapons have prevented not only nuclear war but conventional war in Europe for 40 years," Mrs. Thatcher said in a speech. "That is why we depend and will continue to depend on nuclear weapons for our defense."
Mrs. Thatcher did not fare so well in other battles. In the face of popular opposition, she retreated from plans to privatize the water industry and the National Health Service, replace college grants with a student loan program, cut back pensions and revamp the social security system. Many predicted she would not win a third term. But the economy continued to work in her favor. When she called an election for June 1987, the Tories were returned to power.
Third Term
That October, Wall Street crashed. In the following months, disagreements among the Tories over Britain's future in the European Community and a series of other events forced Mrs. Thatcher to surrender hard-fought gains.
She believed that linking the pound to other currencies would erode Britain's political independence. Mr. Lawson, her chancellor of the Exchequer, argued that it would be better to lay the groundwork for joining the European monetary system by tying the pound to the more stable German mark. Without telling the prime minister, Mr. Lawson, in January 1987, had informally begun to peg the pound to the mark.
Meanwhile, the government's tax-cutting and easy-credit policies fed an investment and housing boom, again fueling inflation. Mr. Lawson, reluctant to allow the value of the pound to rise above the ceiling he had imposed to keep it in range with the mark, ignored calls for higher interest rates. As his actions became apparent, the prime minister accused him of misleading her and warned that the practice had to stop.
But Mr. Lawson and his supporters saw the European monetary system not only as a step toward European integration but also as a safeguard against the kind of wide swings in the pound's value that had so disrupted Britain's economic health in the past. On this fundamental issue the Tories were split, the two sides set on a collision course.
As inflation rose, Mr. Lawson reversed himself and raised interest rates. The sudden effort to stanch the money flow threw Britain into recession. In October 1989, Mr. Lawson resigned, but many devoted Thatcherites admitted that she bore much of the blame.
Other misjudgments were laid at her door. In an effort to make the local authorities more accountable for the way they spent tax money, Mrs. Thatcher pushed through a measure that replaced property taxes with a "poll tax" on all adult residents of a community. The tax was intended to make everyone, not just property owners, pay for local government services. In practice, the measure was manifestly unfair and deeply unpopular. In March 1990, protests flared into riots. Within her own party, there was a growing feeling that the Iron Lady had become a liability.
The Fall
That November, tensions among the Tories exploded. The deputy prime minister, Geoffrey Howe, the last survivor of the original Thatcher cabinet of 1979, was known for his loyalty, though he disagreed with the prime minister's policy toward Europe. Now their differences came to a boil. At a cabinet meeting, "Margaret was incredibly rude to Geoffrey," Kenneth Baker, another minister, recalled. "It was the last straw for Geoffrey, and he resigned that night."
The next day Michael Heseltine, a former defense minister who favored greater links with Europe, announced that he would challenge Mrs. Thatcher for the party leadership. On Nov. 20, as the prime minister was attending a summit meeting in Paris, the Tories took a vote. For Mrs. Thatcher, whose approval ratings in the polls were falling, the outcome was bleak: though she beat Mr. Heseltine, 204 votes to 152, under party rules her majority was not strong enough for her to keep her place.
The race, now wide open, took an unexpected turn. Mrs. Thatcher was awaiting results of the party ballot with her family and friends at 10 Downing Street when she learned that Mr. Heseltine had lost to the soft-spoken chancellor of the Exchequer,John Major, a protégé of hers. When someone said that her colleagues had done an awful turn, she replied, "We're in politics, dear."
Though vowing at first to "fight on and fight to win" the second ballot, she was persuaded to withdraw. After speaking to the queen, calling world leaders and making a final speech to the House of Commons, she resigned on Nov. 28, 1990, leaving 10 Downing Street in tears and feeling betrayed.
After leaving office, Mrs. Thatcher traveled widely and drew huge crowds on the lecture circuit. She sat in the House of Lords as Baroness Thatcher of Kesteven, wrote her memoir and devoted herself to the Margaret Thatcher Foundation, to further her values.
She remained forthright in expressing her opinions. During her final months in office, she had bolstered President George Bush in his efforts to build a United Nations coalition to oppose Iraq after it invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, 1990. At the time of the invasion, Mrs. Thatcher was meeting with Mr. Bush and other world leaders at the Aspen Institute in Colorado. "Remember, George," she is said to have told him, "this is no time to go wobbly."
In retirement, she continued to call for firmness in the face of aggression, advocating Western intervention to stop the ethnic bloodshed in the Balkans in the early 1990s. After the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, she endorsed PresidentGeorge W. Bush's policy of sanctioning pre-emptive strikes against governments that sponsored terrorism. She also backed the war to oust the Iraqi leader,Saddam Hussein.
By then, according to her daughter, Mrs. Thatcher had begun to show signs of the dementia that would overtake her and become, to much criticism, the focus of "Iron Lady," a 2011 film about her withMeryl Streepin the title role.
But while she was of sound mind, Mrs. Thatcher never let up on her anti-Europe views. "In my lifetime, all the problems have come from mainland Europe, and all the solutions have come from the English-speaking nations across the world," she told the Conservative Party conference in 1999. Her words drew predictable outrage, but few doubted that Mrs. Thatcher, as usual, had meant exactly what she said.
She also did not shy from criticizing her successors' actions, including Mr. Major's handling of the economy. Her frankness often embarrassed the Tories. It seemed to many that Mrs. Thatcher preferred Labour's new leader,Tony Blair, to Mr. Major.
That perception was not surprising, since Mr. Blair's victory over Mr. Major in 1997 seemed in a curious way to emphasize the success of Mrs. Thatcher's policies. Mr. Blair led his "New Labour" party to victory on a platform that promised to liberate business from government restrictions, end taxes that discouraged investment and reduce dependence on the state.
Mrs. Thatcher's legacy, "in most respects, is uncontested by the Blair government," Mr. Young, her biographer, said in a 1999 interview. "It made rather concrete something she once said: 'My task will not be completed until the Labour Party has become like the Conservative Party, a party of capitalism.' "
Correction: April 17, 2013, Wednesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An obituary on April 9 about the former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher overstated what is known about one aspect of a 1986 bombing of Libya carried out by the United States with the Thatcher government's support. Although initial news reports, in The Times and elsewhere, said Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi's baby daughter was killed in that attack, her death was never confirmed, and reporting in recent years has shown that Qaddafi most likely lied about her death. Therefore it is probably not the case that the bombing "killed one of his children."

Abstract: Mrs. Thatcher's prescription for Britain in the 1980s -- faith in market forces, willingness to impose short-term austerity in the service of long-term prosperity, and skepticism or even hostility to the fiscal and social costs of the welfare state -- prefigured some of the policies Germany and European regulators are still recommending, wrongly in the view of many economists, for the struggling Southern European countries.

Full text:   LONDON -- As word of Margaret Thatcher's death spread on Monday, it seemed fitting that Prime Minister David Cameron was engaged in what had been billed as a European tour to bring the Continent around to her conservative way of thinking, particularly about Britain's relationship with Europe.
Mrs. Thatcher, many Britons said, transformed their country, opening the way for sweeping privatization and deregulation, legitimizing wealth and unleashing acquisitive, entrepreneurial passions among her compatriots. But Thatcherism, as it came to be known, never found fertile soil on the Continent, not even after the financial crisis and euro zone woes that have plunged much of Europe into an economic gloom at least as dark as that of 1970s Britain.
Yet her doubts about a "European superstate" and the common currency ring true today, nearly a quarter of a century after she resigned. She correctly predicted in her memoirs that Germany's historical fears about inflation would lead to slow-growth policies that would deepen the problems of the euro zone's weaker, less efficient economies, which could no longer rely on devaluation to solve their problems.
Mrs. Thatcher's prescription for Britain in the 1980s -- faith in market forces, willingness to impose short-term austerity in the service of long-term prosperity, and skepticism or even hostility to the fiscal and social costs of the welfare state -- prefigured some of the policies Germany and European regulators are still recommending, wrongly in the view of many economists, for the struggling Southern European countries.
But few of those nations, even in the hard-hit southern tier, have shown the political strength or will to face down the entrenched forces -- unions, state-owned enterprises, encrusted political elites -- that Mrs. Thatcher did, and the crisis drags on without resolution.
It is an indelible part of the Thatcher legacy that her success in remaking Britain never drew the Continent closer to its cantankerous, offshore cousins. Nonetheless, she remains the revered icon of British conservatism, a yardstick for true believers in the free market and the ability of capitalism to spread prosperity in a way that socialist redistribution never could.
Within moments of the announcement of Mrs. Thatcher's death at age 87, Queen Elizabeth II and Mr. Cameron offered tributes to what he called "a great leader, a great prime minister, a great Briton." Mr. Cameron said Parliament would be recalled on Wednesday for a special session in her honor.
The prime minister's office said that, in line with her family's wishes, Mrs. Thatcher would not be accorded a full state funeral but would nonetheless be buried with military honors. That ceremony is to take place on a yet-to-be-announced day next week, at St. Paul's Cathedral. Officials gave no other details, beyond saying that the arrangements would be similar to those made after the death in a Paris car crash in 1997 of Diana, Princess of Wales, whose coffin was carried through crowds in London on a horse-drawn caisson.
The last prime minister to be accorded similar honors was Winston Churchill in 1965, a comparison that spoke for Britain's sense of Mrs. Thatcher as a historical figure, and, as many of her admirers said on Monday, as perhaps the country's greatest peacetime leader.
Mrs. Thatcher was Britain's first female prime minister, serving for 11 years, beginning in 1979. Many Britons remembered her as a dominant yet divisive figure, whose impact on British life and society was enduring, if deeply contentious at the time, and whose pervasive influence on political thinking about the role of the state in free societies spread far beyond Britain's shores.
Along with President Ronald Reagan, with whom she helped define modern conservatism, Mrs. Thatcher propagated a faith in the redemptive power of capitalism that became dominant around the world, and hastened the fall of Communism. But she also helped to unleash market forces, and unravel social compacts, in ways that many societies have yet to resolve.
Even on the day of her death, political leaders, commentators and ordinary citizens from Cyprus to Greece and Portugal, and in the United States, were enmeshed in often angry debates over the policies that defined her legacy. Those crosscurrents continue to play out in her own country, a laboratory under Mr. Cameron for harsh austerity policies.
In addition to the changes she wrought at home, Mrs. Thatcher passionately defended her view of Britain as a significant power in the world, with interests and influences of her own that were independent of the 27-nation European Union. Just as she once famously declared "No! No! No!" in Parliament in response to a French-led push for closer European integration, she looked to Britain's "special relationship" with the United States, not to Europe, as a way of leveraging Britain's weight in international affairs, a view also strongly held by Mr. Cameron.
Since she retired from politics in 1990, toppled by her own party elite, Britain has hewed to her skepticism about Europe, if anything drifting even further from the Continent. It is not a subscriber to some of main vehicles of integration -- the euro currency, and the Schengen accord on free travel across the continent's internal frontiers. Bowing to powerful Thatcherite euroskeptic forces in his party, Mr. Cameron has promised a referendum on continued British membership in the European Union by 2017.
He has also balked at a European push for restrictions on bankers' bonuses and opposed the imposition of stiffer Europe-wide taxes on financial trading. Those measures are anathema to Mr. Cameron's Conservatives and to the financial industry that is centered in the City of London, which has served as a fount of Britain's now-beleaguered prosperity.
If there was a symbol on Monday of the Thatcher legacy, it was that of a British prime minister abandoning an overture to Europe to return home to mourn at a shrine to euroskepticism whose influence still tugs at many ideological passions.
Mr. Cameron spoke for most Conservatives when he said Monday that Mrs. Thatcher had not simply led Britain, "she saved our country."
But the commemorations were accompanied by more acerbic, even vitriolic, remembrances from those who saw her as a destructive figure who had ruptured the economic and social fabric of postwar Britain and left a country that was more divided, more selfish and, for the have-nots, more resentful than at any time in its recent history.
Across the world, the response to Mrs. Thatcher's death appeared to oscillate between similar poles. Many foreign leaders and commentators spoke about her as President Obama did, as "one of the great champions of freedom and liberty," and as an example to women that "there is no glass ceiling that can't be shattered."
However, there were others, particularly on the political left, who spoke with bitterness of the vogue that spread across the globe in the name of Thatcherism and, they said, consigned millions without recourse to the rewards of free enterprise to lives of unrelieved poverty.

Full text:   The Bank of Japan's new antideflation policy made waves throughout the global financial system on Monday, driving down the yen and lifting share prices in Tokyo, but economists said the effect had yet to be fully felt overseas.
The most visible sign of the move by the bank, which is the country's central bank, was the sharp decline of the yen and a 2.8 percent rise in the benchmark Nikkei 225-stock average. The dollar settled at 99.32 yen on Monday in New York, a four-year high. The euro traded at 129 yen, its highest level in more than three years.
"They're taking a page out of the quantitative easing playbook, multiplied two and a half times what the Fed is doing," said Michael H. Strauss, chief investment strategist at Commonfund in Wilton, Conn.
That, he said, created a situation where institutions and individuals both faced pressure to buy stocks, at home and overseas.
The shake-up was touched off on Thursday by Haruhiko Kuroda, the new Bank of Japan governor, who announced a decisive break with his predecessor's policies. He said the bank would nearly double the amount of Japanese currency held by individuals and banks over the next two years as it tries to raise the annual inflation rate to its new 2 percent target.
Mr. Kuroda's plan calls for the central bank to inject nearly 62 trillion yen, or $630 billion, into the economy this year, new money that must find a home. Some of that will undoubtedly end up overseas.
"This is a very big new injection of money into the global system," said Thomas Mayer, senior adviser to Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt, and overseas bonds and equities will be among the beneficiaries.
United States stocks and bonds, which are already trading at high levels, are one obvious target for investors with yen to spend, he said. Core European countries like Germany, France and Britain are also favored destinations for Japanese capital, as are Australia and New Zealand.
The debt of governments in the developed world is already trading at low yields, Mr. Mayer noted, but as long as the euro zone crisis continues, struggling southern euro countries like Spain, Italy and Portugal may attract rather less investor interest because of concern about political risk.
While the size of the Japanese intervention is perhaps unprecedented relative to the size of the country's economy, the Bank of Japan is in good company. The Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and the European Central Bank have all poured in liquidity and worked to hold interest rates down as the global financial sector creaks along year after year. That money is credited with helping to keep government borrowing costs low and to push the Dow Jones industrial average to high levels this month.
A weakening Japanese currency opens a window for international investors to profit on two fronts. With the central bank's main interest rate target near zero, they can borrow the yen cheaply, then lend it abroad.
This "carry trade" offers the possibility of higher returns overseas -- and if the yen falls, investors also reap a foreign-exchange gain since they can repay the loan in cheaper yen.
Of course, a rising yen would bring the opposite result, but the magnitude of the central bank's plan could persuade investors that the currency is set to fall further.
Julian Jessop, chief global economist at Capital Economics in London, estimated that the dollar would continue strengthening to 110 yen this year and to 120 yen next year.
"The Bank of Japan's new policy stance surely does amount to a game changer," he noted, "at least for the currency markets."
The weakening yen may also be felt by companies operating outside Japan -- like American and German automakers and South Korean device manufacturers, which compete head-to-head with Japanese corporations. Those companies may find themselves under pressure to squeeze profit margins to compete against suddenly flush Japanese competitors.
"Some of these Japanese companies were profitable at 78 yen to the dollar," Mr. Strauss said, so the dollar at 100 yen would be a boon for the corporate sector.
It will take time for competitors to Japanese companies to feel the effects, Mr. Mayer said, but he cautioned that there were larger concerns to consider: "By injecting such a large amount of money into the global financial system, you may end up distorting prices in such a way that it causes distortions in the real economy."
Mr. Strauss said the biggest effect would be felt in Japan, where an investor could hold a 10-year government bond with a yield of less than 0.4 percent or could take on a little more risk in stocks.
The lesson after the Japanese investment bubble collapsed in 1990 was "never own equities again," he said, but the moment may have arrived where that no longer holds true.
But today's Japanese investors are more cautious than those of a generation ago, he added.
"I don't think they're going to go out and buy Pebble Beach," he said, referring to the golf course in California that was acquired by a Japanese business owner in 1990 at a wildly inflated price.

Abstract: With all the temporal troubles Venezuela faces, including out-of-control crime, high inflation and production problems in the country's all-important oil industry, Mr. Maduro's campaign has done its best to leverage the spiritual, emphasizing his close, continuing ties to the deceased leader. Mr. Chávez was a charismatic populist and a thorn in the side of Washington, which he pilloried as an imperialist force of evil even as he reaped the financial benefits of Venezuela's being the fourth-largest foreign oil supplier to the United States.

Full text:   SAN FELIPE, Venezuela -- Nicolás Maduro is certainly not the first political candidate to invoke the name and legacy of a dead leader to win votes. But he may be the first to say that his political mentor, President Hugo Chávez, visited him from beyond the grave in the form of a little bird.
In what stands out as the most surreal moment of Venezuela's presidential campaign -- a race whose central personality is the deceased president -- Mr. Maduro told the nation that Mr. Chávez's spirit came to him as a tiny bird that flew into a chapel where he was praying.
So now at campaign rallies he whistles like a bird.
An intense, compressed campaign for president is under way in Venezuela, a month after Mr. Chávez's death from cancer. Voters will go to the polls on Sunday to choose between Mr. Maduro, Mr. Chávez's handpicked political successor, and Henrique Capriles Radonski, a state governor who just six months ago mounted an energetic but losing campaign against Mr. Chávez.
With all the temporal troubles Venezuela faces, including out-of-control crime, high inflation and production problems in the country's all-important oil industry, Mr. Maduro's campaign has done its best to leverage the spiritual, emphasizing his close, continuing ties to the deceased leader.
At times, it seems as if Mr. Chávez is running again himself. At Mr. Maduro's rallies, images of Mr. Chávez are everywhere, with the slogan "Chávez lives!" Mr. Chávez's old campaign songs blast from loudspeakers. His picture is displayed on huge television screens on the stage where Mr. Maduro speaks. Hawkers sell key rings with a picture of Mr. Chávez on one side and Jesus on the other. Supporters sing along to a recording of Mr. Chávez belting out the national anthem.
Mr. Maduro drives home the point by telling crowds that his only mission, if he wins, will be to carry out the socialist revolution that Mr. Chávez left unfinished. He calls himself "the son of Chávez."
Mr. Chávez was a charismatic populist and a thorn in the side of Washington, which he pilloried as an imperialist force of evil even as he reaped the financial benefits of Venezuela's being the fourth-largest foreign oil supplier to the United States.
Mr. Maduro, 50, who was Mr. Chávez's vice president and is now interim president, has followed his mentor's lead. He expelled two military attachés from the United States Embassy, saying they were seeking to destabilize the country, and suggested that the United States might have caused Mr. Chávez's cancer. He accuses former American diplomats of plotting to kill him. And he recently slammed the door on talks aimed at improving relations between the two countries.
But just in case that is not enough, he wants people to know that Mr. Chávez, who is worshiped by many as something close to a god, has come to him from the great beyond.
Appearing on television last week from Mr. Chávez's hometown, Sabaneta, in the western plains, he told the nation that he had been praying in a small chapel when a little bird flew in, perched on a rafter and sang to him. Mr. Maduro said that he whistled back and that the bird responded.
"I felt his spirit," Mr. Maduro said. "I felt him there as if he was blessing us, telling us: 'Today the battle begins. Go to victory."'
The story brought jeers from the opposition and even some raised eyebrows from supporters. But Mr. Maduro is betting there are plenty of believers among the masses.
"It's a message from our commander," said Elena Quiñones, 54, at a Maduro rally in this western city. She carried a homemade sign with photos of Mr. Chávez framing one of the campaign's main slogans: "I swear to you, Chávez, my vote is for Maduro."
"We have to continue the revolution with his son, which is Nicolás Maduro," Ms. Quiñones said.
Mr. Maduro, who spent years far from the hustings as foreign minister, is not a polished campaigner, and he often seems to struggle to connect. At the rally here many ignored his speech, chatting and drinking beer. A large circle formed around a group of young people playing drums and dancing, oblivious to the candidate's speech blasting from nearby speakers.
"Maduro is going to win through Chávez," said Livia Llovera, 42, who works at a preschool. "If it was just him, he might not. The leader is Chávez. We will admire him forever."
Crammed into just a few weeks, the campaign has turned negative fast. Mr. Maduro mocks Mr. Capriles, calling him Caprichito, a play on his name that suggests he is capricious.
He claims the opposition plans to sabotage the electrical network to disrupt the election, and he accused Mr. Capriles of preparing to abandon the campaign and move to New York. On Sunday, Mr. Maduro said a close aide to Mr. Capriles was in cahoots with plotters seeking to kill him.
Mr. Capriles, 40, has hardly been demure himself, calling Mr. Maduro "Fresh Lies" and "the little bird's candidate." He has accused Mr. Maduro's United Socialist Party of obtaining a secret code that can turn digital voting machines on and off.
Mr. Maduro is widely considered the favorite. Mr. Chávez, who dominated political life here for 14 years with his outsize personality and firm hold on power, beat Mr. Capriles by 11 percentage points in October, although Mr. Capriles received the most votes for an opposition candidate since Mr. Chávez was first elected in 1998. Mr. Chávez died March 5; the winner of Sunday's election will complete his six-year term, which began in January.
Mr. Capriles has once again energized a demoralized and fragmented opposition. He is a more polished campaigner than Mr. Maduro. And he seems to have a stronger personal connection with his followers than Mr. Maduro does, a striking turnaround, since Mr. Chávez was legendary for his rapport with the masses.
Mr. Chávez's followers have been through several grueling weeks after the death of their revered leader. And Mr. Maduro's rallies seem at times to struggle against a sense of emotional exhaustion.
The opposition, by contrast, did not have a chance to release its emotions in public after the death of Mr. Chávez, who was hated by some as fiercely as he was loved by others. Mr. Capriles is now feeding off that pent-up energy.
Still, Mr. Chávez's party has a strong get-out-the-vote machine, and it taps nearly unlimited government resources. Government workers are required to attend rallies. Government television stations broadcast every event, and government ministries openly take part in the campaign. At a recent rally in Maracay, a north-central city, people in red T-shirts provided by the government stood in line to get lunches distributed by government workers that included products like bottled juice, made in government-run factories.
Mr. Capriles relies on financing from private companies and donors, and his campaign events are broadcast on a privately owned station closely allied with the opposition.
But most observers say the field is tilted strongly in Mr. Maduro's favor, citing a court system packed with loyalists and an electoral council that refuses to curb the use of government resources in the campaign.
While Mr. Maduro may be shying away from original ideas, the campaign is not without novelty.
At the Maracay rally, Mr. Maduro whistled into a microphone, pointing to an imaginary bird fluttering overhead. Carolina Díaz, 38, carried a poster showing Mr. Maduro's head on a yellow banana (the word "maduro" in Spanish sometimes refers to a ripe plantain). On stage, Mr. Maduro looked incongruously like a boy scout, in a khaki shirt, a red neckerchief and a small green backpack that he has started wearing, saying it is packed with Mr. Chávez's revolutionary dreams.
"Maduro is not convincing," said Edesia Rodríguez, 58, a Capriles supporter at a rally for Mr. Capriles in the city of Barinas, in Mr. Chávez's home state. "He is basing his campaign on what Chávez was. He has nothing new to offer."
But that may be what many Chávez loyalists want. As thousands congregated for the rally in Maracay, two die-hard Chávez supporters discussed their certainty that Mr. Maduro would be elected to carry out the leader's legacy.
"I say to God, let me live until April 14 to vote for Chávez," said one of the men, Nayef Mussa, 67.
"For Maduro," his friend, Marco Rojas, 43, corrected him.
"Bah." Mr. Mussa waved a hand dismissively. "It's the same thing."

Full text:   Margaret Thatcher, who died of a stroke on Monday at age 87, transformed Britain more thoroughly than any other prime minister of the past half-century. She was a pathbreaker from the moment she took office in 1979 as Britain's first, and so far only, female prime minister. And she was the rare conservative leader to come not from the upper echelons of Britain's class-obsessed society, but from a modest apartment above her father's grocery.
But much more than that distinguished the 11 years of Mrs. Thatcher's government, which followed years of tepid leadership, economic stagnation and high inflation. She tamed the power of Britain's once powerful labor movement by shutting down inefficient coal mines and privatizing state-owned industries. She encouraged an entrepreneurial culture that had grown timid and somnolent. With her powerful, plain-spoken approach to issues large (like Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait) and relatively small (the brief war over the Falkland Islands), she reawakened Britain's taste for military engagement.
In the process, she revived policy debates among political parties that had grown too comfortable with safe consensus mumbling. As she pushed the conservatives to the right, she pushed the Labour Party to the center. Without Mrs. Thatcher, there probably would have been no Tony Blair.
She had many critics, and her record was not all triumphal. Eventually, Mrs. Thatcher's relentless negativism on the European Union and her bullying style of leadership pushed her own party to drive her from office in 1990. Over the intervening years, much of the glow has faded from Mrs. Thatcher's economic achievements.
The capitalist revival she sparked did not slow the over-financialization and deindustrialization of the economy, with clear and negative consequences in the 2008 financial crash. Her weakening of the unions also led to a regressively skewed distribution of wealth and, her critics said, a widening gap between rich and poor.
Arguably, Mrs. Thatcher's popular military successes made it easier for Mr. Blair to carelessly and recklessly follow George W. Bush into Iraq. But Mrs. Thatcher knew how to stand up to Ronald Reagan when she needed to -- for example, over the ill-considered United States invasion of Grenada.
She was one of the first Western leaders to recognize the reformist intentions of Mikhail Gorbachev, showed remarkable foresight on the dangers of climate change, and in general managed Britain's global role more deftly than her successors.
Mrs. Thatcher was, without a doubt, a divisive political figure in her day. The passage of time has drained much of the old anger and left behind her record of accomplishments.

Full text:   THIS is the kind of market that makes cautious investors long for the comfort of cash.
Stocks? They seem a little frothy. Bonds? Ugh -- low rates, inflation worries. Real estate? Still a hard sell.
For decades, investors have waited out financial fogs like these in the haven of money market mutual funds. Unfortunately, the outlook for money funds themselves is just as obscure these days.
After wrangling for four years over new rules that would fundamentally change how money funds work, the Securities and Exchange Commission has hit the pause button to await the arrival of a new chairwoman and to study the accounting and tax issues raised by its reform agenda. The money-fund industry, meanwhile, is bracing for new rules while facing old realities: low interest rates that discourage investors and compress fees.
"There is a huge overhang of uncertainty for the industry right now," said James J. Angel, a finance professor at Georgetown who has researched the money-fund issue. "Eventually, the S.E.C. is going to do something. The question is, what will that be?"
One spot of certainty is that the commission will soon have new leadership. Mary Jo White, President Obama's choice to head the agency, is expected to be confirmed by the Senate and sworn in soon. She will be the third person to hold the commission's gavel in less than six months -- Commissioner Elisse B. Walter has served as chairwoman since Mary L. Schapiro stepped down in December.
By law, money funds can buy only top-quality, short-term assets like overnight bank notes or Treasury bills. And unlike other mutual funds, their price is always quoted at $1 a share, with gains treated as interest earned. Those features of safety and stability made them a popular place to park both family and corporate cash, and after their debut in 1971, they hummed along for decades, attracting little regulatory attention.
That changed in September 2008, when Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy set off a run at the Reserve fund family, whose money funds owned about $800 million in Lehman notes. The panic spread to other money funds and abated only after a temporary government guarantee program was imposed.
In the aftermath, regulators like Ms. Schapiro came to see money funds as a threat to the stability of the financial system. In 2010, the commission adopted new rules aimed at making the funds safer and more liquid, including a requirement that they disclose their portfolio holdings each month. That allows regulators to step in before problems arise for investors -- an approach that commission officials want to extend to the entire mutual fund universe.
But many regulators feel that more needs to be done on the money-fund front. Besides Ms. Schapiro, they include members of the Financial Stability Oversight Council, a 15-member panel of government officials and regulators created after of the 2008 crisis and housed in the Treasury Department.
During her tenure, Ms. Schapiro pushed the commission to adopt rules that would replace the stable, $1-a-share price with a floating share price. That change, she argues, would remind investors that shares of money funds can go up and down with the market, and that they aren't as safe as federally guaranteed bank accounts. She also supported an alternative proposal to require funds to keep a 1 percent cash cushion to help cover redemptions, augmented "in times of stress" by a provision under which investors could withdraw no more than 97 percent of their money at one time. The remaining 3 percent would be held back for 30 days to help stabilize the fund.
Ultimately, neither alternative could attract enough votes on the five-member commission and, last August, she officially withdrew them.
But it was a messy maneuver. Commissioners Daniel M. Gallagher, Troy A. Paredes and Luis Aguilar, who opposed Ms. Schapiro's plan, complained publicly that she had painted them as unconcerned about the risks posed by money funds when in fact they simply did not agree that her plan was the best way to reduce those risks.
Mr. Gallagher and Mr. Paredes in particular urged the commission staff to look into other options, specifically the idea of allowing money-fund boards to impose "gates" -- temporary restrictions on redemptions -- when necessary to "stave off a run" or "mitigate the concerns of investors who otherwise may be inclined to redeem." That notion has some grudging acceptance in the fund industry, at least for funds dominated by institutional investors.
In withdrawing her proposals, Ms. Schapiro essentially called for reinforcements. The opposition on the commission "provides the needed clarity for other policy makers" concerned about money-fund risks, she said last summer, and she urged other regulators to step into the fray.
The oversight council obliged. In November, it released a plan for an overhaul largely mirroring Ms. Schapiro's agenda, except for an option that would preserve the stable share price so long as cash cushions and some withdrawal restrictions were imposed. Like the Schapiro plan, the council's proposals were condemned as unnecessary by the mutual fund industry and as unworkable by many money-fund customers, especially corporate finance executives and state and municipal treasurers.
But the plan was hailed as overdue by the Systemic Risk Council, a nonprofit advisory group headed by Sheila C. Bair, former chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and by some consumer advocates, notably "Occupy the S.E.C.," an offshoot of the Occupy Wall Street movement.
By the time the council's proposals were released, the S.E.C. staff had produced a study showing that the 2010 rules had made funds "more resilient now to both portfolio losses and investor redemptions than they were in 2008." But even with those rules in place, no fund could have survived the Reserve fund panic, the staff concluded. It dismissed worries that money-fund changes would impair the corporate and government credit markets.
The study did not specifically address the feasibility of "gates," which individual investors in money funds might find as alarming as a floating share price. Nor did it deal with the corporate treasurers' complaints about accounting and tax issues that would accompany a fluctuating share price. According to industry executives, commission staff members have recently been doing additional research in those areas.
A result is expected to be a new slate of proposals that can pre-empt the oversight council and win passage on a commission that will soon be led by Ms. White -- who has kept her own counsel on the topic. At her recent confirmation hearing, she barely mentioned the phrase "money market funds" in her prepared statement. Questioned about the issue, she said only that she was "acutely aware of the value of the money market fund product" and would "take care that that is not harmed."
THE industry landscape isn't ideal for wholesale regulatory change, according to figures from the Investment Company Institute, the mutual fund trade group. The number of money funds has steadily fallen -- to 580 last year, from 1,039 in 2000 -- as low interest rates discourage savers and the industry consolidates.
The total amount invested in those funds is now $2.6 trillion, down from $3.8 trillion just before the 2008 crisis. And to avoid erasing the tiny returns paid to investors, fund companies had to waive a total of $18 billion in fees from 2009 to 2012; that's 50 percent more than they waived from 2000 to 2008.
Those bleak economics clearly constrain the regulatory options -- a "cash cushion" requirement sounds especially far-fetched -- but continued uncertainty isn't helpful, either.
The next shoe may drop soon. The annual meeting of the Investment Company Institute is scheduled for the first three days of May in Washington; traditionally, the head of the S.E.C. is the closing speaker at that event. If Ms. White has been sworn in by then, the lectern will most likely be hers -- and the fog may finally start to lift a little for money-fund investors.

Full text:   Is the party over?
With both the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index hitting new highs this week, and the S.& P. 500 having already gained 10 percent in the first quarter, a growing chorus of analysts and financial advisers are warning investors that it is too late to join the rally.
Their logic seems unassailable: if ideally the goal of investing is to buy low and sell high, stock investors would indisputably be buying high right now. That the market would continue at anywhere near its first-quarter pace -- an annualized return of 40 percent -- stretches credulity. And by historical norms, this bull market, which began in March 2009, is aging.
Of course, this is what experts almost always say when stocks rise to new highs. So I wondered, what would have happened to investors who bought stocks in the past only after stock indexes hit new highs?
To find out, I used the S.& P. 500 index, and looked for those points where the index hit a new high at least one year after its previous high. (These points should not be confused with market peaks, which can be identified only in hindsight.) I used a one-year intervening decline because new highs get attention only when a substantial period of time has elapsed since the previous one.
By my count, there have been eight such new highs since the S.& P. assumed its current form in 1957. I also looked at the high reached by the S.& P.'s predecessor in 1954.
If investors had ignored the adage that the easy money had already been made and bought an index fund at those points, then held the investment for five and 10 years, how would they have fared?
In all but one instance -- if investors had bought in October 2007 -- they would have realized positive returns, not adjusted for inflation. Even in that case, when the S.& P. 500 surpassed the previous high set in 2000, the five-year loss was modest. Of course, it is too soon to know what the 10-year result will be, but with the market's recent new highs, the index has recouped all its losses.
In several cases over those years, the gains were spectacular, ranging from over 100 percent to 200 percent and more. The best returns would have been realized by investors who bought in mid-1989, when the S.& P. 500 surpassed the high previously set in October 1987, before the crash that year. By 1999, investors had nearly quadrupled their money in one of the market's greatest bull runs.
(Of course, they were headed for a crash in 2000. Even though the market reached a peak that year, by my definition there was no new milestone high because the index had not traded below its October 1987 high for a year or more.)
It seems that buying high -- or at least at new highs -- may not be such a bad strategy after all.
Several experts I consulted this week suggested the result may not be as surprising as it seems.
Richard Sylla, a professor of the history of financial institutions and markets at New York University, pointed out that anyone who bought stocks early in the great bull markets beginning in the mid-1950s and in 1982 experienced outsize returns, even if they bought at new market highs. By contrast, if they bought at new highs reached in mid-1967 or 1972, returns were tepid, even negative when adjusted for inflation.
"The long periods between new highs -- 1929 to 1954, 1968 to 1982, and 2000 to 2007 -- were periods marked by both bad economic policies and wars," Professor Sylla said. "The periods of steady advance -- 1954 to 1968 and 1982 to 2000 -- featured better economic policies and minor wars. Right now, it seems to me that economic policies are improving, as is the economy as we put the financial crisis behind us, and we are getting out of wars instead of into them, knock on wood. That could indicate that we are in the early stages of a period that might resemble 1954 to 1968 or 1982 to 2000. So the recent new highs could well be a signal that it's a good time to invest in equities."
Jeremy J. Siegel, a finance professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and author of the classic "Stocks for the Long Run," said he agreed that "the data doesn't bear out that just because the market has hit a new all-time high, it's too late to buy stocks."
What matters, he said, are fundamental measures of valuation. And in that regard, he said: "I believe that we're on a very strong bull leg because of market valuations and record low interest rates. The market is selling at about 14 times projected 2013 earnings. That's below the long-term average over 200 years of about 15. If the market immediately gained 7 to 8 percent, we'd only be at the mean. That gives us plenty of room for further gains. It would have to go up another 30 to 40 percent for there to be the first warning signs."
The big rallies in the 1950s and 1980s also began when the stock market's price-earnings ratio was modestly below the historical average. At the peak of the Internet bubble in 2000, the market price-earnings ratio was over 30.
"These are very good times for equity investors, and I think the five-year returns from here will be very good," Professor Siegel said. "There's a lot of skepticism after the worst bear market in 75 years and two serious bear markets in one decade. It's sobering and it scared a lot of people. That's not the sign of a market top."
Jeremy Grantham, co-founder and chief investment strategist of GMO, a large asset manager, sounded a more cautious note. Mr. Grantham, who has gained recognition for his ability to spot investment bubbles, argued that current price-earnings ratios had been suppressed by high and unsustainable profit margins.
"Jeremy Siegel is very clever," Mr. Grantham said, "but he was bullish in 2007. He believes these extravagantly high profit margins are sustainable. But if you adjust for normalized margins, the United States market is pretty expensive."
To which Professor Siegel responded: "Margins are high because of increased foreign sales, which have higher margins, and lower interest rates. These factors are not going away anytime soon."
Mr. Grantham said that by some measures, the United States stock market is overvalued by about a third. "I'd say the odds of getting a good 10-year return from today are very slim. I'd guess there's a 25 percent chance of an average return, and a 75 percent chance of a subaverage return," he said. He has recommended that clients underweight United States stocks.
"That's been painful," Mr. Grantham said. "You have to grit your teeth and suck it up. But you should have a decent amount of money in reserve because this is a vulnerable market."
Still, even Mr. Grantham conceded that this was not 2000 or 2007, and said the market might well notch further gains. "It doesn't feel like 2000," he said, when he famously argued that the S.& P. 500 was 50 percent overvalued.
"My personal view is that this doesn't feel like the end," he said. Investors, prodded by the Fed's low interest rate policy, "can drive this market higher and they probably will."
"The inevitable decline will be equivalently more painful," he added.
All three agreed that corrections were inevitable, that they might even be healthy, and that, as Professor Sylla put it, "nothing goes up forever." Plenty could go wrong for investors, from nuclear saber-rattling in North Korea and Iran to political gridlock in Washington and renewed crisis in the euro zone. But there is always something to worry about.
As Professor Siegel emphasized, one reason that investors who buy at new highs have done well over five- and 10-year periods is that stocks nearly always do well over long periods.
"The long-term trend of the market is up," he said. "You shouldn't buy when valuations are at their peaks, but even then, if you wait long enough, you'll be bailed out."

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The speaker of the House, John A. Boehner, waved aside reports on Friday that President Obama would seek a new budget compromise next week, accusing the president of again demanding tax increases in exchange for "modest entitlement savings."
"If the president believes these modest entitlement savings are needed to help shore up these programs, there's no reason they should be held hostage for more tax hikes," Mr. Boehner said in a statement. "That's no way to lead and move the country forward."
At the same time, Mr. Obama's supporters on the left quickly vented their anger about his plans, saying they would not accept changes to Social Security and Medicare that would threaten the programs and harm beneficiaries.
"Evidently the president either does not understand or does not care how critically important Social Security and Medicare are, not just to seniors but to middle-aged and younger workers for whom these programs are likely to be even more crucial," said Eric Kingson, a co-chairman of the Strengthen Social Security coalition, a group of unions and left-leaning organizations.
The sharp reaction was a preview of what is likely to come on Wednesday when the president formally unveils his annual budget for the fiscal year that begins on Oct. 1. The New York Times reported on Friday that the document would call for a deal similar to the final compromise offer that Mr. Obama made to Mr. Boehner last year before talks fell apart -- cuts to entitlement programs in exchange for new revenues from tax increases.
Among those cuts is a change in the way inflation is calculated for Social Security called a "chained" Consumer Price Index, which Republicans have supported in the past. Administration officials said the president would only accept such proposals now if Republicans were willing to support increased revenues.
The reaction from both sides also demonstrates how little space there is in Washington for a bipartisan deal when it comes to tax and spending issues.
For the president, the budget proposal -- which will come two months after he is required by law to release a federal spending plan -- appears to be another attempt to test whether Republicans can accept further tax increases under any circumstances.
"It is not the ideal proposal, but the president recognizes, unlike, I guess, Republicans, that we're not in the business in Washington of getting everything we want," said Jay Carney, the White House press secretary. "That does not happen."
But, Mr. Carney added, "the president believes that we ought to deal with our deficit challenges in a balanced way, and he's looking for partners on the other side of the aisle who agree with him."
To that end, the president is to have dinner with a dozen Republican senators on Wednesday evening just after he releases his budget.
The reaction from Mr. Boehner and other Republicans suggests that a deal remains elusive, in large part because Republicans remain suspicious about how far the president is willing to go in making serious entitlement cuts that would anger his supporters.
Mr. Boehner said that the president had "never lived up to his rhetoric" about being willing to cut entitlement programs.
"In reality, he's moved in the wrong direction, routinely taking off the table entitlement reforms he's previously told me he could support," Mr. Boehner said in his statement.
Representative Eric Cantor, Republican of Virginia, the House majority leader, also seemed unimpressed. On CNBC's "The Squawk Box," he said that if the president agreed with Republicans about some entitlement changes, he should agree to make them without additional tax increases.
Mr. Cantor said he did not understand "why we just don't see the White House come forward and do the things that we agree on." But, he added, "I am in a wait-and-see mode as to whether this White House is really serious."
White House officials noted that the Social Security inflation proposal was something that Republican leaders, including Mr. Boehner and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, once embraced.
"They have been advocated by Republicans," Mr. Carney told reporters Friday. "It means Republicans' being willing to accept what speaker of the House John Boehner said was good policy three months ago -- not an outlandish request."
Advocates of taking action to confront the nation's debt praised Mr. Obama's proposals. Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said the president's proposals "point the way toward an emerging bipartisan consensus between the administration and Congressional leaders over essential fiscal issues."
Liberals, however, are already balking.
"President Obama's plan to cut Social Security would harm seniors who worked hard all their lives," said Anna Galland, the executive director of the liberal group MoveOn.org. "Under this plan, a typical 80-year-old woman would lose the equivalent of three months' worth of food every year. That's unconscionable."

Full text:   MEXICO CITY -- When Banco Santander held the $4.13 billion public stock offering of its Mexico subsidiary here last September, a mariachi band and Mexican folk dancers set the festive mood for a media breakfast in a sun-filled dining room atop the stock exchange's skyscraper.
The offering -- the largest ever in Mexico and trailing only initial public offerings from Facebook and Japan Airlines in terms of size in 2012 -- was just one sign of the strong revival of the nation's financial services sector.
Both global and local banks are jostling to underwrite stock issues. Mexican companies are looking for financing to help expand and make acquisitions. New structured finance products are attracting billions from local pension funds.
And with the continuing crisis in Europe and lackluster growth hurting the United States and other economies, Mexico's growth prospects are attracting investment banks and investors hunting for ways to gain greater exposure to international markets.
"It's the coming of age of the Mexican market," said Eduardo Cepeda, J.P. Morgan's senior country officer.
It is a marked change from just a few years ago, when the loss of manufacturing jobs to China and recession in the United States had left the country's economy stagnant for the better part of a decade.
The current atmosphere is not without risks. For one, the new government has yet to present a convincing plan for tackling organized crime and drug cartels, which carry out kidnappings and gruesome killings that still dominate headlines. And persistent low wages in Mexico also serve to tamp down domestic demand.
Still, changes have taken place to foster optimism in the financial services industry. The new government of President Enrique Peña Nieto, who took office in December, has managed to recast the country's image by moving vigorously on legislation to attack problems that are a drag on growth.
Even before Mr. Peña Nieto took office, prudent policies had whittled away government debt, built up foreign reserves, controlled inflation and stabilized the peso. Growth of about 4 percent in 2011 and again in 2012 outpaced Brazil.
"Investment bankers benefit from upswings and downturns," said Mauro Guillén, a professor of international management at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. "Everybody is expecting a lot of deals in Mexico."
The financial services industry is making up for lost time, jumping back into an emerging market that had long been overlooked. The sector's growth is also being helped by an important new player in the local market: Mexico's pension funds, which manage nearly $160 billion in assets. That figure is expected to double over the next six years, according to Carlos Ramírez Fuentes, the president of Consar, the government's pension fund regulator.
"The Mexican financial system is still relatively small," Mr. Ramírez said. "The resources are growing fast, and you need different alternatives for investment."
Mexico created a pension plan 15 years ago that channels a percentage of each worker's salary into a private fund, run by a manager called an Afore, a Spanish acronym.
For the first decade, Afores were limited to buying government debt. As regulators began to relax the rules, the funds diversified into corporate debt, and then into the stock market and structured finance instruments.
The pension funds continue to "redefine the capital markets" in Mexico, said Jaime Martínez-Negrete, the president of Morgan Stanley Mexico, which opened a broker-dealer in late 2010 to serve the local market. "It's a market that is becoming more deep and broad in its products."
To attract investment from those pension funds, Mexico's stock market and the finance ministry created a special vehicle, a structured equity security known as a CKD.
The CKD allows investors to buy into a publicly traded fund that typically invests in infrastructure, real estate and private companies. Since they were first created in 2009, there have been 29 issues, worth about $4.8 billion.
A subset of the CKDs has been Mexico's version of real estate investment trusts, known as Fibras. "There is enormous potential for growth and development for CKDs and Fibras," said Gema Sacristán, chief of the financial markets division at the Inter-American Development Bank in Washington. "Mexico's regulators should continue looking for new investment schemes and institutional investors."
Mexico's stock market is also showing signs of revival, although it is still relatively small compared to Brazil's, its main rival in Latin America. With only a handful of new issues a year or even less, the stock market is worth just 46 percent of gross domestic product, compared with about 150 percent for Brazil, Luis Téllez, the president of the Mexican Stock Exchange, said.
But initial public offerings are showing signs of life. Mr. Téllez said he expected 15 I.P.O.'s this year, although the total amount they raise may be lower than in 2012 because of the size of the Santander deal. Last month, Sempra Energy's Mexico subsidiary raised $600 million in the exchange's third corporate I.P.O. of the year.
Also among this year's offerings was the I.P.O. of Grupo Sanborns, the retail arm of the billionaire Carlos Slim Helú's empire. It sold $950 million in shares to finance expansion.
Both foreign and domestic investors are buying the shares, Mr. Téllez said. "For foreign investors, it is very reassuring that there are Mexican institutional funds that can also take the paper."
There are a number of more subtle factors working in favor of more stock offerings, bankers say. One of those is an evolution in the closely held family-owned businesses, which have been reluctant to list or have so few shares floating that they are very illiquid.
Another change may be a move by more multinationals, like Santander and Sempra, to sell shares in their subsidiaries in Mexico, where growth prospects are higher than at home.
Wal-Mart's Mexican subsidiary, for example, which is the country's largest private employer, trades on the Mexican exchange at about double the price-to-earnings ratio that Wal-Mart Stores trades at on the New York Stock Exchange.
"Right now, we have experienced the longest period in three decades of a continuous open window for equities," Mr. Martínez-Negrete said.
The market for credit is also growing. After the peso crisis of 1994 sent Mexico's banks into free fall, they were sold off to global banks. But the new owners were conservative about lending in Mexico. The banks are strongly capitalized and have complied with new international standards known as Basel III.
The government's sound finances means it can issue 30-year bonds priced in pesos. Foreign funds are buying along with local ones. "This shows a lot of confidence in the currency and in the credit of the government," Mr. Cepeda said.
For the first time in many years, local companies are generating cash and looking to expand at home and abroad, said Alfredo Capote, the head of investment banking at Banamex, Citigroup's Mexico subsidiary. "Investors like these stories because there are very few stories of growth and consolidation around the world," he said.
At the same time, foreign manufacturers are returning to Mexico as a production platform for the recovering American market. At the top of that list are global automakers, which are investing $10 billion in new assembly plants.
Mexico "has exported its way to prosperity," said William H. Gross, the founder of Pimco, which has been accumulating Mexican sovereign debt over the last 18 months. "They now own dollars as opposed to owing dollars."

Full text:   FRANKFURT -- The head of the European Central Bank on Thursday rejected suggestions that Cyprus or any other country might give up the euro or be better off if it did.
During the last year, Mario Draghi, president of the bank, has managed to quiet financial markets, cap government borrowing costs and contain the euro zone crisis by making it clear that the bank would not allow the 17-country euro currency union to come apart. But it is not clear what tools he sees at his disposal.
In a news conference, he also gave no indication how the central bank might stimulate the moribund economies of the euro zone. The bank said Thursday that it would leave its benchmark interest rate unchanged. "Cyprus is no turning point in euro policy," Mr. Draghi said. There is "no Plan B."
Making sure that "credit will flow to the real economy seems to be the E.C.B.'s No. 1 priority," Carsten Brzeski, an economist at ING Bank, wrote in a note to investors. "However, judging from today's news conference, the E.C.B. looks rather clueless on how to tackle the problem."
The bank left its benchmark interest rate unchanged on Thursday at 0.75 percent, while the Bank of England held its rate steady at 0.5 percent. With both central banks' rates already at record lows, there might be little room to use interest rates as an economic stimulus. But the euro zone economies, like that of Britain, are stagnant and in need of help wherever they can find it.
Mr. Draghi said the European Central Bank was looking for new ways to stimulate lending in the weak euro zone economy and could move quickly. "We will assess all the data in coming weeks and we stand ready to act," he said, without offering many clues about what measures he might have in mind.
The global financial crisis in recent years has forced central banks around the world to do much more than simply tweak the official interest rate as they did in the past. On Thursday, Haruhiko Kuroda, the new governor of the Bank of Japan, Japan's central bank, announced that it would seek to double the amount of money in circulation over two years to try to end years of falling prices.
Mr. Draghi said there was a consensus among the 23 members of the European Central Bank's governing council not to cut rates even lower "for the time being." The bank also discussed other, unconventional ways to help countries where credit remained tight, he said.
"The experiences of other countries tell us we have to think deeply before we can come up with something useful and consistent within our mandate," he said.
Large-scale purchases of corporate debt, which the Federal Reserve has used to stimulate lending in the United States, would be more difficult in Europe because most companies get their credit directly from banks, Mr. Draghi indicated.
With inflation already below the European bank's target of about 2 percent, some analysts have worried that the euro zone faces a risk of deflation -- a broad decline in prices that can be more destructive and difficult to cure than inflation. Mr. Draghi said, however, that risks to price stability were "broadly balanced," indicating that he did not see a major risk of deflation.
Data from Markit, a research firm, confirmed the continued downturn on Thursday. Its survey of business activity showed a marked drop in France and a stalling of growth in Germany, the largest and most robust economy in the euro zone.
Mr. Draghi predicted that the euro zone would recover, but he sounded slightly less confident than in the past. "Tight credit conditions," he said, "will continue to weigh on economic activity."
The Bank of England's decision to keep the benchmark interest rate unchanged on Thursday was made despite concern that new data might show that the British economy fell back into recession at the start of the year.
Mr. Draghi found himself devoting much of the hourlong news conference to trying to dispel fears that Cyprus represented an ominous new phase of the euro zone crisis.
Mr. Draghi acknowledged that an initial decision by officials from the European Union, the International Monetary Fund and the central bank to impose a tax on small bank deposits was "not smart, to say the least." But he pointed out that euro zone officials had quickly corrected that error.
At the same time, he defended the decision that did stick: to place much of the burden of bailing out Cyprus banks on large depositors. In a long discourse on the lessons of Cyprus, he said it showed the need for centralized banking supervision that would enable regulators to detect problems before they became a broader threat.
While European leaders have agreed to give the central bank power to oversee euro zone banks, they remain divided on measures to protect depositors and to deal with failed financial institutions.
Mr. Draghi warned that countries where banking risk was several times larger than the economy -- as in Cyprus, Britain and Luxembourg -- were especially vulnerable. Those countries have to be more conservative, he said, avoiding large budget deficits and ensuring that the banks have ample capital buffers. "If anything, the events on Cyprus have reinforced the governing council's determination to support the euro while maintaining price stability and acting within our mandate," he said. The muted market reaction to events in Cyprus, he said, showed that "we are now in a position to cope with serious crises without them becoming existential or systemic."
He said no country in the euro zone would be better off leaving the euro, as some commentators have suggested. "What was wrong with Cypriot economy doesn't stop being wrong if they are outside of the euro," Mr. Draghi said. "An exit entails many risks -- big risks."

Abstract: The central bank said it had inflated the economy by aggressively buying longer-term bonds and doubling its government bond holdings in two years. If Japan recklessly pursued aggressive monetary and fiscal policies, "the long-term interest rate could rise and fiscal collapse would ensue," said Ryutaro Kono, an economist at BNP Paribas.

Full text:   TOKYO -- Haruhiko Kuroda, the new governor of the Bank of Japan, delivered on his promise to drastically change Japan's economic policy to end a long, debilitating era of deflation.
The nation's central bank announced on Thursday that it would double the amount of money in circulation and try to produce annual inflation of about 2 percent. "This is monetary easing in an entirely new dimension," Mr. Kuroda said after the bank's decision.
The central bank said it had inflated the economy by aggressively buying longer-term bonds and doubling its government bond holdings in two years. The bank said it would aim to create a robust 2 percent inflation rate "at the earliest possible time."
This major shift in Japan's monetary policy is a stark contrast to years of what many economists said was a halfhearted battle to end deflation. Deflation is a damaging fall in prices, profits and wages, and it weighs on economic growth.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who took office in late December, has made beating deflation a central point of his economic policy. He wrestled with the bank's former leaders over creating the 2 percent inflation goal. Mr. Abe's pressure was so relentless that the bank's previous governor, the moderate Masaaki Shirakawa, resigned weeks before the end of his term. That departure led to the appointment of Mr. Kuroda, who shares Mr. Abe's economic philosophy.
Mr. Kuroda emphasized the break with history, repeatedly pointing to a graph showing the planned jump in the country's money supply as he answered reporters' questions on the bank's new policies.
"Incremental steps of the kind we've seen so far weren't going to get us out of deflation," Mr. Kuroda said. "I'm certain we have now adapted all policies we can think of to meet the 2 percent price target," he said.
And if prices do not rise as expected, he said he "would not hesitate" to step up the bank's easing program. Mr. Kuroda faulted his predecessors for fearing the possibility of igniting runaway inflation and for being too ready to pull back at the first sign of higher inflation.
Japanese stocks have soared in recent months on anticipation of a reversal in monetary policy under Mr. Abe. It was fanned by recent assurances from Mr. Kuroda that he would do "whatever it takes" to defeat deflation.
But in recent days, the stock market had retreated as investors wondered whether Mr. Kuroda would make good on his promises.
Shortly after the bank's announcement, the benchmark Nikkei 225 index jumped from negative territory to end the day 2.2 percent higher. The yen weakened to 96.13 yen per dollar in Tokyo from about 93 yen before the announcement.
"Kuroda did it," Masaaki Kanno, economist at JPMorgan Securities Japan, said in a note to clients. "This is a historical change in the B.O.J.'s policy."
Some economists were cautious, though. The central bank's giant purchases of government debt could eventually be seen by investors as enabling runaway public spending, quashing confidence that Japan would ever pare its already sky-high public debt. They also said it could also drive up long-term interest rates.
If Japan recklessly pursued aggressive monetary and fiscal policies, "the long-term interest rate could rise and fiscal collapse would ensue," said Ryutaro Kono, an economist at BNP Paribas.
Others argue that rising prices, once stoked, can be hard to control, a fear related to memories of Japan's bubble economy of the 1980s and the subsequent painful collapse.
Some experts also question whether monetary policy alone can end deflation in Japan. The country has other deflationary pressures like an aging and shrinking population and cumbersome regulations that make the economy inefficient. They say that lending has not increased at a high enough rate despite the easy money already available because businesses and consumers see little potential for growth.
Mr. Kuroda said that such risks or doubts should not hold the bank back from fighting deflation.
"We have debated the side effects but we are currently not concerned that long-term interest rates might spike, or conversely, that there would be an asset bubble," Mr. Kuroda said. "That risks exist should not hold us back from pursuing much-needed monetary easing. We will keep in mind those risks, but push ahead," he said.
He also said that once Japan had fought off deflation and restarted its economy, lending would surely follow, spurring more economic growth in a virtuous cycle. "We are already seeing an improvement in sentiment among consumers and companies," he said. "As the economy expands, and prices rise, lending will also grow."
In a statement detailing the new measures, the bank said it would buy longer-term government bonds, lengthening the average maturity of its holdings to seven years from three years and expanding Japan's monetary base to 270 trillion yen by March 2015.
Under that plan, the bank will buy about 7 trillion yen in bonds each month, equivalent to over 1 percent of its gross domestic product, which is almost twice the bond purchases of the United States Federal Reserve Bank.
The policies are part of a new asset purchase framework that focuses on the monetary base instead of the overnight interest rate. That rate has remained close to zero for years with little effect on increasing prices or expanding the economy. The bank will also consolidate all its purchases in a single operation in an effort to improve transparency of the bank's purchases.
Mr. Kuroda said that the bank would suspend, for now, a long-standing rule that limits its bond holdings to the amount of money in circulation. The new governor pointed out that limit had already been surpassed anyway.
Mr. Kuroda acknowledged that Japan's new monetary push was weakening the yen, which will bolster Japan's exporters at the expense of overseas rivals. A weak yen has long been a sticking point between Tokyo and its trading partners. But he declined to comment further, saying currencies were beyond his mandate as central bank governor.
Government officials welcomed the bank's decision.
"The bold monetary easing steps go beyond expectations," said Akira Amari, the economic minister. "The Bank of Japan is finally steering Japan toward rising prices."

Abstract: [...]if Republicans continue to resist the president, the White House believes that most Americans will blame them for the fiscal paralysis. Besides the tax increases that most Republicans continue to oppose, Mr. Obama's budget will propose a new inflation formula that would have the effect of reducing cost-of-living payments for Social Security benefits, though with financial protections for low-income and very old beneficiaries, administration officials said.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- President Obama next week will take the political risk of formally proposing cuts to Social Security and Medicare in his annual budget in an effort to demonstrate his willingness to compromise with Republicans and revive prospects for a long-term deficit-reduction deal, administration officials say.
In a significant shift in fiscal strategy, Mr. Obama on Wednesday will send a budget plan to Capitol Hill that departs from the usual presidential wish list that Republicans typically declare dead on arrival. Instead it will embody the final compromise offer that he made to Speaker John A. Boehner late last year, before Mr. Boehner abandoned negotiations in opposition to the president's demand for higher taxes from wealthy individuals and some corporations.
Congressional Republicans have dug in against any new tax revenues after higher taxes for the affluent were approved at the start of the year. The administration's hope is to create cracks in Republicans' antitax resistance, especially in the Senate, as constituents complain about the across-the-board cuts in military and domestic programs that took effect March 1.
Mr. Obama's proposed deficit reduction would replace those cuts. And if Republicans continue to resist the president, the White House believes that most Americans will blame them for the fiscal paralysis.
Besides the tax increases that most Republicans continue to oppose, Mr. Obama's budget will propose a new inflation formula that would have the effect of reducing cost-of-living payments for Social Security benefits, though with financial protections for low-income and very old beneficiaries, administration officials said. The idea, known as chained C.P.I., has infuriated some Democrats and advocacy groups to Mr. Obama's left, and they have already mobilized in opposition.
As Mr. Obama has before, his budget documents will emphasize that he would support the cost-of-living change, as well as other reductions that Republicans have called for in the popular programs for older Americans, only if Republicans agree to additional taxes on the wealthy and infrastructure investments that the president called for in last year's offer to Mr. Bohener.
Mr. Obama will propose other spending and tax credit initiatives, including aid for states to make free prekindergarten education available nationwide -- a priority outlined in his State of the Union address in February. He will propose to pay for it by raising federal taxes on cigarettes and other tobacco products.
"The president has made clear that he is willing to compromise and do tough things to reduce the deficits, but only in the context of a package like this one that has balance and includes revenues from the wealthiest Americans and that is designed to promote economic growth," said a senior administration official, who, like others, declined to be identified confirming details about the coming budget.
"That means," the official added, "that the things like C.P.I. that Republican leaders have pushed hard for will only be accepted if Congressional Republicans are willing to do more on revenues."
But just this week, Representative Eric Cantor, Republican of Virginia, the House majority leader, reiterated the party's antitax stance and called for reducing spending by cutting waste and making changes in federal programs. The growth in the so-called entitlement programs, especially for health care, is a main driver behind projections of mounting federal debt as baby boomers age and medical costs rise.
Mr. Obama's budget was due in February but administration officials said it was delayed by the year-end fiscal negotiations and resulting tax changes. It will arrive on Capitol Hill hours before the president dines on Wednesday evening with a dozen Senate Republicans -- his second such parlay in recent weeks.
While the group is likely to also discuss gun-safety and immigration legislation, the timing of Mr. Obama's budget release is all but certain to make it a prime topic.
Some Senate Republicans have been urging the president to speak out more to Americans about his ideas for reducing the growth of entitlement programs. While the White House posted the offer to Mr. Boehner on its Web site this year, aides previously said that Mr. Obama would not include its provisions in his official budget documents. To do so, some said, would expose him to Democrats' criticism that he is too quick to compromise and allow Republicans to embrace the proposals for spending cuts, in particular the C.P.I., but ignore those for tax increases.
Neither the president nor senior aides privately hold much hope that Republican leaders -- Mr. Boehner and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Senate Republican leader -- will compromise. So Mr. Obama's strategy of reaching out to other Senate Republicans reflects a calculation that enough of them might cut a budget deal with the Democratic Senate majority. If that happens, the reasoning goes, a Senate-passed compromise would put pressure on the House to go along.
According to administration officials, the president's budget plan would reduce projected annual deficits by $1.8 trillion over 10 years, even with the select spending increases. To offset the initiatives' cost and avoid adding to deficits, Mr. Obama will propose the tobacco tax increase, a limit of $3 million on how much people can accumulate in tax-preferred savings accounts and repeal of a loophole that allows people to collect both disability and unemployment benefits.
Together with the $2.5 trillion in deficit reductions that Mr. Obama and Congressional Republicans have agreed to since 2010, that would bring the total deficit reduction to more than $4.3 trillion over 10 years by the administration's computations -- just over the goal that both parties have set for stabilizing the growth of the national debt.
The deficit, which for this fiscal year is expected to be equal to 5.5 percent of the size of the economy, as measured by the gross domestic product, would decline to 1.7 percent by 2023, according to officials.
Of the more than $2.5 trillion to date in projected 10-year budget savings, nearly 80 percent would result from spending cuts. The rest would derive from tax increases on high incomes that became law on Jan. 1, in the tax agreement that the two parties reached at year-end when the efforts for a broader deficit-reduction deal collapsed.
Mr. Obama's proposals to reduce deficits $1.8 trillion more over a decade track his offer to Mr. Boehner, adjusted for the roughly $600 billion in higher taxes that became law in January. He will propose more than $600 billion in new revenues -- his last offer had called for $1.2 trillion in taxes -- mostly by limiting to 28 percent the deductions that individuals in higher tax brackets can claim. Congress has ignored that idea in past years.
Deficits would be reduced another $930 billion through 2023 as a result of spending cuts and other cost-saving changes to domestic programs, and $200 billion more due to reduced interest payments on the federal debt.
Mr. Obama's proposed spending reductions include about $400 billion from health programs and $200 billion from other areas, including farm subsidies, federal employee retirement programs, the Postal Service and the unemployment compensation system.
In Medicare, the savings would mostly come from payments to health care providers, including hospitals and pharmaceutical companies, but Mr. Obama also proposes that higher-income beneficiaries pay more for coverage.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve officials are grappling publicly with a better kind of problem than most they've confronted in recent years: what if the labor market continues to improve more rapidly than they had expected?
The economy added an average of 187,000 jobs a month from September to February, slightly faster than the average monthly pace from 2004 to 2006, the best years of the last economic upswing. The government plans to release a preliminary estimate Friday morning of March job creation.
Some Fed officials have suggested in recent weeks that if economic growth continues on its present trajectory, the central bank should begin to roll back its economic stimulus campaign by the middle of the year, ahead of expectations.
But the Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, and his allies remain wary that another surprising spring will be followed by another disappointing summer. Janet L. Yellen, the Fed's vice chairwoman, who is viewed as a potential successor to Mr. Bernanke, reflected that caution in a speech on Thursday.
"I am encouraged by recent signs that the economy is improving and healing from the trauma of the crisis, and I expect that, at some point, the F.O.M.C. will return to a more normal approach to monetary policy," she said, referring to the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets policy for the central bank.
For now, she said, the Fed needs to remain focused on reducing unemployment.
Ms. Yellen also commented obliquely on her own future. Asked whether the economics profession, and central banks, needed more women in positions of power, she responded that such a need was "something we're going to see increase over time, and it's time for that to happen."
The Fed announced last year that it intended to hold short-term interest rates near zero so long as the unemployment rate remained above 6.5 percent. It also said that it would buy $85 billion a month in Treasury and mortgage-backed securities to accelerate the decline. By expanding its asset holdings, the Fed continuously increases the scale of its effort to stimulate the economy.
Stronger data has raised hopes that the economy is once again growing fast enough to reduce the unemployment rate, which stood at 7.7 percent in February, little changed from 7.8 percent in September. But more than 20 million Americans are unable to find full-time jobs and it is not yet clear that the recent uptick in the economy is sustainable. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.77 percent on Thursday, indicating that some investors are pessimistic about the economy's prospects.
In recent months, weekly claims for unemployment benefits have declined. But the Labor Department reported on Thursday that claims spiked in the latest week to the highest level in four months, although it cautioned that the estimate was unusually imprecise because the week included Easter.
"House prices are going up more than I would have expected six months ago," Ms. Yellen said. "I think it's making people feel a whole lot better." She added: "I don't have any doubt that our policies are contributing to the lowest interest rates, whether it's borrowing for a car or borrowing for a mortgage. I believe that that is not only caused by our policy, but our policy is contributing."
John C. Williams, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said on Wednesday in Los Angeles that he might support a reduction in the volume of the Fed's asset purchases by summer and a suspension of the program before the end of the year.
"I'm hopeful that the economy has finally shifted into higher gear," said Mr. Williams, who supported the purchases last year.
Esther L. George, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, reiterated on Thursday her view that the Fed should scale back immediately. Ms. George cast the sole dissenting vote at the last two meetings of the Fed's policy-making committee. She told an audience in El Reno, Okla., on Thursday that she was more concerned than her colleagues that the Fed's efforts to suppress borrowing costs could result in financial instability and faster inflation.
Ms. Yellen and other officials, however, seem inclined to postpone any decisions. The pace of economic growth has remained weak relative to the pace of job growth. The most recent round of federal spending cuts has only just begun to show results. And Fed officials have overestimated the strength of the recovery repeatedly in recent years, only to find the economy needed still more help. Caution may now dictate doing more rather than less.
"I have not seen enough evidence yet to convince me that 2013 is going to break out of that pattern that we've seen, really over the last four years," Dennis P. Lockhart, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, said on Thursday in Dayton, Ohio, according to Bloomberg News. Mr. Lockhart, who spoke as part of a panel discussion, said that it might be appropriate to curtail purchases late this year or early next year if the economy continued to add at least 180,000 jobs a month. Charles L. Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, who appeared on the same panel, set a higher bar, saying he'd like to see "200,000-a-month increases for like six months," Bloomberg News reported.
Deciding when to stop buying is complicated, because the benefits of the asset purchases are both mechanical and psychological. The Fed is mechanically suppressing borrowing costs, but it is also reinforcing in the public eye its broader commitment to hold down borrowing costs for years to come. Fed officials argue that suspending its purchases would maintain a constant level of downward pressure on borrowing costs, because the Fed would continue to hold the same quantity of bonds. But investors have responded to the suspension of earlier rounds of asset purchases as if the Fed were signaling the start of a broader retreat, reducing the economic benefits of the policy even without shrinking the portfolio.
In recent months, Fed officials said they had concluded that reducing the volume of purchases, rather than stopping abruptly, could help the Fed to communicate with investors more precisely.
"In my view," Ms. Yellen said, "adjusting the pace of asset purchases in response to the evolution of the outlook for the labor market will provide the public with information regarding the committee's intentions and should reduce the risk of misunderstanding and market disruption as the conclusion of the program draws closer."

Full text:   When the Great Depression struck, many influential people argued that the government shouldn't even try to limit the damage. According to Herbert Hoover, Andrew Mellon, his Treasury secretary, urged him to "Liquidate labor, liquidate stocks, liquidate the farmers. ... It will purge the rottenness out of the system." Don't try to hasten recovery, warned the famous economist Joseph Schumpeter, because "artificial stimulus leaves part of the work of depressions undone."
Like many economists, I used to quote these past luminaries with a certain smugness. After all, modern macroeconomics had shown how wrong they were, and we wouldn't repeat the mistakes of the 1930s, would we?
How naïve we were. It turns out that the urge to purge -- the urge to see depression as a necessary and somehow even desirable punishment for past sins, while inveighing against any attempt to mitigate suffering -- is as strong as ever. Indeed, Mellonism is everywhere these days. Turn on CNBC or read an op-ed page, and the odds are that you won't see someone arguing that the federal government and the Federal Reserve are doing too little to fight mass unemployment. Instead, you're much more likely to encounter an alleged expert ranting about the evils of budget deficits and money creation, and denouncing Keynesian economics as the root of all evil.
Now, the fact is that these ranters have been wrong about everything, at every stage of the crisis, while the Keynesians have been mostly right. Remember how federal deficits were supposed to cause soaring interest rates? Never mind: After four years of such warnings, rates remain near historic lows -- just as Keynesians predicted. Remember how running the printing presses was going to cause runaway inflation? Since the recession began, the Fed has more than tripled the size of its balance sheet, but inflation has averaged less than 2 percent.
But the Mellonites just keep coming. The latest example is David Stockman, Ronald Reagan's first budget director, who has just published a mammoth screed titled "The Great Deformation."
His book doesn't have much new to say. Although Mr. Stockman's willingness to criticize some Republicans and praise some Democrats has garnered him a reputation as an iconoclast, his analysis is pretty much standard liquidationism, with a strong goldbug streak. We've been doomed to disaster, he asserts, ever since F.D.R. took us off the gold standard and introduced deposit insurance. Everything since has been a series of "sprees" (his favorite word): spending sprees, consumption sprees, debt sprees, and above all money-printing sprees. If disaster was somehow avoided for 70-plus years, it was thanks to a series of lucky accidents.
So it's more or less the usual stuff. In particular, like so many in his camp, Mr. Stockman misunderstands the meaning of rising debt. Yes, total debt in the U.S. economy, public and private combined, has risen dramatically relative to G.D.P. No, this doesn't mean that we as a nation have been living far beyond our means, and must drastically tighten our belts. While we have run up a significant foreign debt (although not as big as many imagine), the rise in debt overwhelmingly represents Americans borrowing from other Americans, which doesn't make the nation as a whole any poorer, and doesn't require that we collectively spend less. In fact, the biggest problem created by all this debt is that it's keeping the economy depressed by causing us collectively to spend too little, with debtors forced to cut back while creditors see no reason to spend more.
So what should we be doing? By all means, let's restore the kind of effective financial regulation that, in the years before the Reagan revolution, helped deter excessive leverage. But that's about preventing the next crisis. To deal with the crisis that's already here, we need monetary and fiscal stimulus, to induce those who aren't too deeply indebted to spend more while the debtors are cutting back.
But that prescription is, of course, anathema to Mellonites, who wrongly see it as more of the same policies that got us into this trap. And that, in turn, tells you why liquidationism is such a destructive doctrine: by turning our problems into a morality play of sin and retribution, it helps condemn us to a deeper and longer slump.
The bad news is that sin sells. Although the Mellonites have, as I said, been wrong about everything, the notion of macroeconomics as morality play has a visceral appeal that's hard to fight. Disguise it with a bit of political cross-dressing, and even liberals can fall for it.
But they shouldn't. Mellon was dead wrong in the 1930s, and his avatars are dead wrong today. Unemployment, not excessive money printing, is what ails us now -- and policy should be doing more, not less.

Full text:   RICHMOND, Va. -- Federal Reserve officials regularly air their views in public speeches, but they rarely engage in public debates. On Tuesday night, two of the officials who disagree most sharply about the Fed's current policy did just that.
The exchange between Charles L. Evans, an outspoken advocate for the Fed's efforts to stimulate the economy, and Jeffrey M. Lacker, the Fed's most persistent internal critic, suggested their differences are as much a matter of temperament as economics.
Mr. Lacker, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, said he did not expect the economy to recover the losses sustained during the recession. "It's hard to talk about the economic outlook without being a little bit of a sourpuss," he said during a panel discussion sponsored by Virginia Commonwealth University.
Mr. Evans, describing himself as "the happy guy in the room," said the recovery had been postponed rather than canceled.
Mr. Lacker said he doubted monetary policy had more power to increase growth.
Mr. Evans said the Fed had an obligation to try because unemployment remained high.
Mr. Evans said the Fed would have sufficient warning of inflationary pressures to keep price increases under control. Mr. Lacker said he was worried the Fed was overconfident about its ability to manage the risk.
Both men emphasized that their views could prove to be wrong.
Their basic difference is about whether it would be better to do too little or too much.
The Fed is trying to stimulate the economy by suppressing interest rates, reducing borrowing costs and encouraging risk-taking. It intends to hold short-term rates near zero at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6.5 percent. The rate stood at 7.7 percent in February. To hasten that process, the Fed also is buying $85 billion a month of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities.
The Fed's course continues to be set by its chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, and a centrist majority he has carefully assembled who regard asset purchases as necessary and effective. In recent months, Mr. Bernanke and his supporters have argued forcefully that the risks of doing too little exceed the risks of doing too much.
"I do not claim that there are no costs or risks associated with our unconventional monetary policy regime," one of Mr. Bernanke's closest allies, William C. Dudley, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said last month. "But I see greater cost and risk in moving prematurely to a policy setting that might not prove sufficiently accommodative to ensure a sustainable, strengthening recovery."
Mr. Bernanke said last month that the Fed's next step is likely to be a reduction in the volume of monthly asset purchases rather than an abrupt cessation. And even that first step may not come for some time.
Dennis P. Lockhart, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, said Tuesday that he thought the Fed would need to keep buying bonds at least until the end of this year, and possibly into next year.
"There are encouraging developments in the economy, to be sure, but the evidence of sustainable momentum that will deliver 'substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market; is not yet conclusive," Mr. Lockhart said. "I favor a 'wait and watch' mode for the time being. Several more months of positive data -- especially in a range of employment data--would give me confidence that the economy has real traction and is unlikely to backslide."
Mr. Evans made clear that he, too, wants the Fed to keep buying bonds. He has said that the central bank needs to demonstrate that its commitment to reduce unemployment equals its commitment to control inflation.
The Fed is charged by Congress with minimizing unemployment, which has persisted at high levels since the financial crisis, and stabilizing prices.
"Our credibility will ultimately be judged by how we do on both of these mandates, not just the price mandate," Mr. Evans said Tuesday night. "I think we will be judged very badly" if officials do not act forcefully to reduce unemployment and instead, he said, "worry obsessively" about inflation.
Only one Fed official has gone further than Mr. Evans and suggested that the Fed should increase its efforts to stimulate the economy.
Narayana Kocherlakota, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, reiterated in a speech Tuesday that the Fed should hold short-term rates near zero at least so long as the unemployment rate was above 5.5 percent, one percentage point lower than the Fed's current 6.5 percent threshold.
Mr. Lacker, by contrast, said Tuesday night that he saw little evidence the Fed's efforts were helping the economy. He said that reflected the limits of monetary policy, particularly the experimental strategies the Fed has deployed in recent years. He also noted that the Fed had repeatedly overestimated the strength of the recovery.
"There's little more that we can do," Mr. Lacker said of monetary policy. "There's little more that we can contribute to growth."

Double-Digit Inflation Worsens in Iran

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDEDIran's double-digit inflation rate worsened for the sixth consecutive month in March, the government said on Monday, in what appeared to be an implicit acknowledgment that international sanctions linked to the disputed Iranian nuclear program are causing some economic harm.
The government's statistics office said the rate increased in March to an annualized 31.5 percent, compared with 30.2 percent in February and 26.4 percent a year earlier, the semiofficial Mehr News Agency reported. The Mehr report did not offer an explanation for the increase except to specify that much of it was in the categories of food, beverages and tobacco.
Many economists say the real rate could be at least double the official rate, partly because it does not fully take into account the prices of many imported goods, which have become prohibitively expensive. The main reason is the severe depreciation of the rial, Iran's national currency, as the sanctions that have limited Central Bank activities and oil exports have taken hold.
Some experts believe the Iranian inflation calculation deliberately understates the actual rate in order to present a public face of resistance to the coercive pressures inflicted by the sanctions, which have been imposed largely by the United States and European Union.
"It's unclear how the Iranian government calculates the inflation rate, especially given the lack of transparency and accountability within the political system, but the official rate announced by the Iranian government is politically motivated," said Alireza Nader, an Iran specialist in Washington at the RAND Corporation.
He said the prices of some food items had increased by as much as 100 percent in recent months.
"Of course inflation was high before sanctions against the Central Bank, but there are indications that sanctions have pushed Iran's inflation much higher," he said. "This means a more severe economic outlook for the Iranian government, and the population's continued loss of confidence in the Islamic Republic's ability to keep the economy afloat."
Proponents of the sanctions have argued that they are not meant to hurt the Iranian people, but rather to create enough pressure on the government so that it is more willing to negotiate. The sanctions advocates say they are working, as reflected in Iran's eagerness to re-engage in talks with the major powers aimed at resolving the nuclear dispute.
Iran's foreign minister, Ali Akbar Salehi, said last week that he was hopeful that "forward movement" would be achieved at the next round of talks on Friday and Saturday in Almaty, Kazakhstan.
Critics of the sanctions argue that despite the public Iranian expressions of optimism, there has been no sign that the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is willing to soften his hostility to what he regards as American bullying.
Correction: April 4, 2013, Thursday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A picture on Tuesday with an article about Iran's announcement that its double-digit inflation had worsened in March for the sixth consecutive month was published in error. It showed a spice shop in the Deira section of Dubai, United Arab Emirates, not one in Deira, Iran. (There is no Deira in Iran.) The article also misspelled the middle name of Iran's foreign minister in some editions. He is Ali Akbar Salehi, not Akhbar.

Full text:   GREENWICH, Conn.The Dow Jones and Standard & Poor's 500 indexes reached record highs on Thursday, having completely erased the losses since the stock market's last peak, in 2007. But instead of cheering, we should be very afraid.
Over the last 13 years, the stock market has twice crashed and touched off a recession: American households lost $5 trillion in the 2000 dot-com bust and more than $7 trillion in the 2007 housing crash. Sooner or later -- within a few years, I predict -- this latest Wall Street bubble, inflated by an egregious flood of phony money from the Federal Reserve rather than real economic gains, will explode, too.
Since the S.&P. 500 first reached its current level, in March 2000, the mad money printers at the Federal Reserve have expanded their balance sheet sixfold (to $3.2 trillion from $500 billion). Yet during that stretch, economic output has grown by an average of 1.7 percent a year (the slowest since the Civil War); real business investment has crawled forward at only 0.8 percent per year; and the payroll job count has crept up at a negligible 0.1 percent annually. Real median family income growth has dropped 8 percent, and the number of full-time middle class jobs, 6 percent. The real net worth of the "bottom" 90 percent has dropped by one-fourth. The number of food stamp and disability aid recipients has more than doubled, to 59 million, about one in five Americans.
So the Main Street economy is failing while Washington is piling a soaring debt burden on our descendants, unable to rein in either the warfare state or the welfare state or raise the taxes needed to pay the nation's bills. By default, the Fed has resorted to a radical, uncharted spree of money printing. But the flood of liquidity, instead of spurring banks to lend and corporations to spend, has stayed trapped in the canyons of Wall Street, where it is inflating yet another unsustainable bubble.
When it bursts, there will be no new round of bailouts like the ones the banks got in 2008. Instead, America will descend into an era of zero-sum austerity and virulent political conflict, extinguishing even today's feeble remnants of economic growth.
THIS dyspeptic prospect results from the fact that we are now state-wrecked. With only brief interruptions, we've had eight decades of increasingly frenetic fiscal and monetary policy activism intended to counter the cyclical bumps and grinds of the free market and its purported tendency to underproduce jobs and economic output. The toll has been heavy.
As the federal government and its central-bank sidekick, the Fed, have groped for one goal after another -- smoothing out the business cycle, minimizing inflation and unemployment at the same time, rolling out a giant social insurance blanket, promoting homeownership, subsidizing medical care, propping up old industries (agriculture, automobiles) and fostering new ones ("clean" energy, biotechnology) and, above all, bailing out Wall Street -- they have now succumbed to overload, overreach and outside capture by powerful interests. The modern Keynesian state is broke, paralyzed and mired in empty ritual incantations about stimulating "demand," even as it fosters a mutant crony capitalism that periodically lavishes the top 1 percent with speculative windfalls.
The culprits are bipartisan, though you'd never guess that from the blather that passes for political discourse these days. The state-wreck originated in 1933, when Franklin D. Roosevelt opted for fiat money (currency not fundamentally backed by gold), economic nationalism and capitalist cartels in agriculture and industry.
Under the exigencies of World War II (which did far more to end the Depression than the New Deal did), the state got hugely bloated, but remarkably, the bloat was put into brief remission during a midcentury golden era of sound money and fiscal rectitude with Dwight D. Eisenhower in the White House and William McChesney Martin Jr. at the Fed.
Then came Lyndon B. Johnson's "guns and butter" excesses, which were intensified over one perfidious weekend at Camp David, Md., in 1971, when Richard M. Nixon essentially defaulted on the nation's debt obligations by finally ending the convertibility of gold to the dollar. That one act -- arguably a sin graver than Watergate -- meant the end of national financial discipline and the start of a four-decade spree during which we have lived high on the hog, running a cumulative $8 trillion current-account deficit. In effect, America underwent an internal leveraged buyout, raising our ratio of total debt (public and private) to economic output to about 3.6 from its historic level of about 1.6. Hence the $30 trillion in excess debt (more than half the total debt, $56 trillion) that hangs over the American economy today.
This explosion of borrowing was the stepchild of the floating-money contraption deposited in the Nixon White House by Milton Friedman, the supposed hero of free-market economics who in fact sowed the seed for a never-ending expansion of the money supply. The Fed, which celebrates its centenary this year, fueled a roaring inflation in goods and commodities during the 1970s that was brought under control only by the iron resolve of Paul A. Volcker, its chairman from 1979 to 1987.
Under his successor, the lapsed hero Alan Greenspan, the Fed dropped Friedman's penurious rules for monetary expansion, keeping interest rates too low for too long and flooding Wall Street with freshly minted cash. What became known as the "Greenspan put" -- the implicit assumption that the Fed would step in if asset prices dropped, as they did after the 1987 stock-market crash -- was reinforced by the Fed's unforgivable 1998 bailout of the hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management.
That Mr. Greenspan's loose monetary policies didn't set off inflation was only because domestic prices for goods and labor were crushed by the huge flow of imports from the factories of Asia. By offshoring America's tradable-goods sector, the Fed kept the Consumer Price Index contained, but also permitted the excess liquidity to foster a roaring inflation in financial assets. Mr. Greenspan's pandering incited the greatest equity boom in history, with the stock market rising fivefold between the 1987 crash and the 2000 dot-com bust.
Soon Americans stopped saving and consumed everything they earned and all they could borrow. The Asians, burned by their own 1997 financial crisis, were happy to oblige us. They -- China and Japan above all -- accumulated huge dollar reserves, transforming their central banks into a string of monetary roach motels where sovereign debt goes in but never comes out. We've been living on borrowed time -- and spending Asians' borrowed dimes.
This dynamic reinforced the Reaganite shibboleth that "deficits don't matter" and the fact that nearly $5 trillion of the nation's $12 trillion in "publicly held" debt is actually sequestered in the vaults of central banks. The destruction of fiscal rectitude under Ronald Reagan -- one reason I resigned as his budget chief in 1985 -- was the greatest of his many dramatic acts. It created a template for the Republicans' utter abandonment of the balanced-budget policies of Calvin Coolidge and allowed George W. Bush to dive into the deep end, bankrupting the nation through two misbegotten and unfinanced wars, a giant expansion of Medicare and a tax-cutting spree for the wealthy that turned K Street lobbyists into the de facto office of national tax policy. In effect, the G.O.P. embraced Keynesianism -- for the wealthy.
The explosion of the housing market, abetted by phony credit ratings, securitization shenanigans and willful malpractice by mortgage lenders, originators and brokers, has been well documented. Less known is the balance-sheet explosion among the top 10 Wall Street banks during the eight years ending in 2008. Though their tiny sliver of equity capital hardly grew, their dependence on unstable "hot money" soared as the regulatory harness the Glass-Steagall Act had wisely imposed during the Depression was totally dismantled.
Within weeks of the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy in September 2008, Washington, with Wall Street's gun to its head, propped up the remnants of this financial mess in a panic-stricken melee of bailouts and money-printing that is the single most shameful chapter in American financial history.
There was never a remote threat of a Great Depression 2.0 or of a financial nuclear winter, contrary to the dire warnings of Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman since 2006. The Great Fear -- manifested by the stock market plunge when the House voted down the TARP bailout before caving and passing it -- was purely another Wall Street concoction. Had President Bush and his Goldman Sachs adviser (a k a Treasury Secretary) Henry M. Paulson Jr. stood firm, the crisis would have burned out on its own and meted out to speculators the losses they so richly deserved. The Main Street banking system was never in serious jeopardy, ATMs were not going dark and the money market industry was not imploding.
Instead, the White House, Congress and the Fed, under Mr. Bush and then President Obama, made a series of desperate, reckless maneuvers that were not only unnecessary but ruinous. The auto bailouts, for example, simply shifted jobs around -- particularly to the aging, electorally vital Rust Belt -- rather than saving them. The "green energy" component of Mr. Obama's stimulus was mainly a nearly $1 billion giveaway to crony capitalists, like the venture capitalist John Doerr and the self-proclaimed outer-space visionary Elon Musk, to make new toys for the affluent.
Less than 5 percent of the $800 billion Obama stimulus went to the truly needy for food stamps, earned-income tax credits and other forms of poverty relief. The preponderant share ended up in money dumps to state and local governments, pork-barrel infrastructure projects, business tax loopholes and indiscriminate middle-class tax cuts. The Democratic Keynesians, as intellectually bankrupt as their Republican counterparts (though less hypocritical), had no solution beyond handing out borrowed money to consumers, hoping they would buy a lawn mower, a flat-screen TV or, at least, dinner at Red Lobster.
But even Mr. Obama's hopelessly glib policies could not match the audacity of the Fed, which dropped interest rates to zero and then digitally printed new money at the astounding rate of $600 million per hour. Fast-money speculators have been "purchasing" giant piles of Treasury debt and mortgage-backed securities, almost entirely by using short-term overnight money borrowed at essentially zero cost, thanks to the Fed. Uncle Ben has lined their pockets.
If and when the Fed -- which now promises to get unemployment below 6.5 percent as long as inflation doesn't exceed 2.5 percent -- even hints at shrinking its balance sheet, it will elicit a tidal wave of sell orders, because even a modest drop in bond prices would destroy the arbitrageurs' profits. Notwithstanding Mr. Bernanke's assurances about eventually, gradually making a smooth exit, the Fed is domiciled in a monetary prison of its own making.
While the Fed fiddles, Congress burns. Self-titled fiscal hawks like Paul D. Ryan, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, are terrified of telling the truth: that the 10-year deficit is actually $15 trillion to $20 trillion, far larger than the Congressional Budget Office's estimate of $7 trillion. Its latest forecast, which imagines 16.4 million new jobs in the next decade, compared with only 2.5 million in the last 10 years, is only one of the more extreme examples of Washington's delusions.
Even a supposedly "bold" measure -- linking the cost-of-living adjustment for Social Security payments to a different kind of inflation index -- would save just $200 billion over a decade, amounting to hardly 1 percent of the problem. Mr. Ryan's latest budget shamelessly gives Social Security and Medicare a 10-year pass, notwithstanding that a fair portion of their nearly $19 trillion cost over that decade would go to the affluent elderly. At the same time, his proposal for draconian 30 percent cuts over a decade on the $7 trillion safety net -- Medicaid, food stamps and the earned-income tax credit -- is another front in the G.O.P.'s war against the 99 percent.
Without any changes, over the next decade or so, the gross federal debt, now nearly $17 trillion, will hurtle toward $30 trillion and soar to 150 percent of gross domestic product from around 105 percent today. Since our constitutional stasis rules out any prospect of a "grand bargain," the nation's fiscal collapse will play out incrementally, like a Greek/Cypriot tragedy, in carefully choreographed crises over debt ceilings, continuing resolutions and temporary budgetary patches.
The future is bleak. The greatest construction boom in recorded history -- China's money dump on infrastructure over the last 15 years -- is slowing. Brazil, India, Russia, Turkey, South Africa and all the other growing middle-income nations cannot make up for the shortfall in demand. The American machinery of monetary and fiscal stimulus has reached its limits. Japan is sinking into old-age bankruptcy and Europe into welfare-state senescence. The new rulers enthroned in Beijing last year know that after two decades of wild lending, speculation and building, even they will face a day of reckoning, too.
THE state-wreck ahead is a far cry from the "Great Moderation" proclaimed in 2004 by Mr. Bernanke, who predicted that prosperity would be everlasting because the Fed had tamed the business cycle and, as late as March 2007, testified that the impact of the subprime meltdown "seems likely to be contained." Instead of moderation, what's at hand is a Great Deformation, arising from a rogue central bank that has abetted the Wall Street casino, crucified savers on a cross of zero interest rates and fueled a global commodity bubble that erodes Main Street living standards through rising food and energy prices -- a form of inflation that the Fed fecklessly disregards in calculating inflation.
These policies have brought America to an end-stage metastasis. The way out would be so radical it can't happen. It would necessitate a sweeping divorce of the state and the market economy. It would require a renunciation of crony capitalism and its first cousin: Keynesian economics in all its forms. The state would need to get out of the business of imperial hubris, economic uplift and social insurance and shift its focus to managing and financing an effective, affordable, means-tested safety net.
All this would require drastic deflation of the realm of politics and the abolition of incumbency itself, because the machinery of the state and the machinery of re-election have become conterminous. Prying them apart would entail sweeping constitutional surgery: amendments to give the president and members of Congress a single six-year term, with no re-election; providing 100 percent public financing for candidates; strictly limiting the duration of campaigns (say, to eight weeks); and prohibiting, for life, lobbying by anyone who has been on a legislative or executive payroll. It would also require overturning Citizens United and mandating that Congress pass a balanced budget, or face an automatic sequester of spending.
It would also require purging the corrosive financialization that has turned the economy into a giant casino since the 1970s. This would mean putting the great Wall Street banks out in the cold to compete as at-risk free enterprises, without access to cheap Fed loans or deposit insurance. Banks would be able to take deposits and make commercial loans, but be banned from trading, underwriting and money management in all its forms.
It would require, finally, benching the Fed's central planners, and restoring the central bank's original mission: to provide liquidity in times of crisis but never to buy government debt or try to micromanage the economy. Getting the Fed out of the financial markets is the only way to put free markets and genuine wealth creation back into capitalism.
That, of course, will never happen because there are trillions of dollars of assets, from Shanghai skyscrapers to Fortune 1000 stocks to the latest housing market "recovery," artificially propped up by the Fed's interest-rate repression. The United States is broke -- fiscally, morally, intellectually -- and the Fed has incited a global currency war (Japan just signed up, the Brazilians and Chinese are angry, and the German-dominated euro zone is crumbling) that will soon overwhelm it. When the latest bubble pops, there will be nothing to stop the collapse. If this sounds like advice to get out of the markets and hide out in cash, it is.

Full text:   WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- Consumer spending rose in February and Americans' outlooks perked up this month, further signs of an acceleration in economic activity in the first quarter after a near stall late last year.
Data reported on Friday also showed a rebound in income growth, putting the economy in a better shape to deal with tighter fiscal policy, particularly $85 billion in across-the-board federal government spending cuts known as the sequester.
"The economy is in a good place now in terms of momentum and strength, and it will need it as the government spending cuts will take something off growth as the year progresses," said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ in New York.
Consumer spending increased 0.7 percent last month after a 0.4 percent rise in January, the Commerce Department said.
Part of the increase in spending, which accounts for about 70 percent of United States economic activity, was because of higher gasoline prices. But Americans also bought long-lasting goods like automobiles and spent more on services. The price of gas rose 35 cents a gallon last month.
After adjusting for inflation, spending was up 0.3 percent after rising by the same margin in January. Economists said it was headed toward its fastest growth pace since 2010.
"It appears that consumer spending actually accelerated in the first quarter despite the tax hikes implemented at the start of the year," said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York.
Some economists bumped up their first-quarter economic growth estimates.
Barclays raised its gross domestic product forecast by 0.7 percentage point, to 3.3 percent. Macroeconomic Advisers lifted its estimate by three-tenths of a point to 3.5 percent. The economy grew a 0.4 percent annual pace in the fourth quarter.
A separate report showed that households this month seemed to shrug off the deep government spending cuts. The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan index of consumer sentiment rose to a reading of 78.6, from 77.6 in February.
"Consumers have discounted the administration's warning that economic catastrophe would follow the reductions in federal spending, and consumers have renewed their expectation that gains in employment will accelerate through the rest of 2013," said the survey's director, Richard Curtin.
And they have reason to be optimistic. With steady improvement in the labor market, income increased a healthy 1.1 percent after tumbling 3.7 percent in January.
Employment growth gained steam in February, factory activity touched a one-and-a-half-year high and first-time filings for jobless benefits have increased just modestly so far in March.
Last month, the income at the disposal of households after inflation and taxes increased 0.7 percent, after dropping 4 percent in January.
With income growth outpacing spending, the saving rate -- the percentage of disposable income that households save -- rose to 2.6 percent, from 2.2 percent in January.
The higher gasoline prices pushed up inflation, with a price index for consumer spending rising 0.4 percent after being flat for two straight months. February's increase in the PCE index was the largest since August.
But a core reading that strips out food and energy costs rose only 0.1 percent after increasing 0.2 percent in January, showing no sign of underlying inflation pressures. Core prices were up 1.3 percent, well below the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target.
The benign inflation picture should give the Fed room to continue with its monetary stimulus as it seeks to bolster job growth.

Full text:   The most widely followed barometer of the United States stock market rose to a new high on Thursday, exceeding its 2007 peak, while most of the rest of the world could only look on in envy.
The nominal record set by the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is the latest sign that the American economy is recovering some of the strength it had before the financial collapse of 2008, partly helped by stimulus from the Federal Reserve.
It has been a little more than three weeks since the Dow Jones industrial average hit a milestone high, also set in October 2007, but the S.& P. is considered more representative of the breadth of American stocks.
The S.& P. reached its new nominal high after several days of flirting with the record as investors struggled with the turmoil caused by Cyprus's banking crisis. The milestone capped a strong first quarter, in which the index rose 10 percent to hit the high.
Meanwhile, stock markets in nearly every other large economy around the world are still well below their records. An index of the entire world's stock market, without the United States, is still down about 29 percent from the level it hit in 2007, according to an analysis by Ned Davis Research. Only some smaller nations, such as Denmark, Mexico and Colombia, have fully recovered their losses.
Workers in the United States have learned that the stock market's performance is not always a good gauge of the underlying economy's strength. Unemployment in the United States has remained stubbornly high at the same time that share prices have risen since bottoming out in March 2009. Even with the record level, the S.& P. 500 is still not back to its 2007 level when inflation is taken into account.
Still, the performance of the American stock market would have seemed improbable during the depths of the crisis, given that it was financial markets in the United States that led the global economy into recession. Strategists and economists have said that the divergence since then is largely a result of the relative speed with which the United States government and corporate sector responded to the causes of the 2008 crisis.
"The U.S. addressed the problems of the financial crisis faster and with much more ferocity than the rest of the world," said Edward M. Clissold, a market strategist at Ned Davis Research.
The S.& P. 500 finished Thursday up 0.4 percent, or 6.34 points, at 1,569.19. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 0.4 percent, or 52.38 points, to 14,578.54. That is 11 percent above its level at the beginning of the quarter.
The Nasdaq composite index rose 0.3 percent, or 11 points to 3,267.52, far below the heights it reached during the dot-com boom in 2000.
Economists have given much of the credit for the market's recovery to the Fed, which worked quickly with the rest of the federal government to bail out and revamp the nation's banks and financial system, which the European Central Bank started doing in earnest only last year. While bank bailouts remain contentious, they have allowed the institutions to resume lending.
The Fed also acted on its own to pump money into the economy with bond-buying programs known as quantitative easing. Many central bankers around the world worried that those programs would result in extreme inflation. There are also fears that the American economy will not be able to remain on its current trajectory once the Fed draws back. But all that has not stopped other countries from beginning to copy the Fed's lead.
"The Fed has won the battle, and continues to win the battle," said Jack Malvey, the chief global markets strategist at BNY Mellon.
In Japan, the government of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was elected last December after promising a more aggressive approach to monetary policy. Japan's Nikkei index has been the best performer of any of the world's large stock markets in the first quarter of this year, rising 19 percent. That still leaves the Nikkei almost 68 percent below the heights it scaled in 1989 before Japan's real estate market soured.
The European Central Bank began taking more aggressive action to stimulate the Continent's economy last year, most notably after the bank's president, Mario Draghi, said last July that he would do "whatever it takes to preserve the euro." Since then, European stock indexes have roughly kept pace with the S.& P. 500, but the MSCI index of European stocks remains 28 percent below its 2007 peak.
The other major catalyst for the ascent of the American stock market is the cost-cutting strategy used by corporate executives, which has raised profit and allowed companies to increase dividends to shareholders. That strategy, however, has exacted a toll on American workers, who have faced layoffs and pay cuts.
In Europe, by contrast, the greater legal protections offered to workers have made it harder for companies to revamp their businesses for the current economic environment.
"There is a very aggressive corporate mind-set, that a lot of people don't agree with," said Joseph P. Quinlan, the chief market strategist for Bank of America's private wealth management division. "But corporate America has proved that it is much nimbler and more resilient" in the new economic climate.
In many emerging economies, the lagging performances of the stock markets have not necessarily pointed to slower overall growth.
China's economy, for instance, continues to expand at a significantly faster pace than the American economy. But China's stock market has suffered because growth is slower than many investors expected just a few years ago. In addition, Chinese companies are more reliant on exports to places like Europe than corporate America. That has contributed to the MSCI China index remaining down 42 percent from highs in 2007.
Even with higher economic growth in some developing countries, investors have sought out American investments as a haven during the last few years when big shocks threatened the global economy. Last year alone, $385 billion in foreign money flowed into American stocks and bonds, while investors in the United States sent almost no new money overseas, according to data released this week by the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis.
Many strategists expect the big global threats to diminish as 2013 goes on, which could help encourage more investing outside the United States. So far this year, the stock markets in a number of countries have done better than the S.& P. 500.
Even in the United States, the rising market has not helped all stocks. Citigroup's shares, for instance, are worth 92 percent less than they were back in 2007. That is almost the percentage the Greek stock market is down from its 1999 peak.
In the bond market, interest rates showed little change on Thursday. The price of the Treasury's 10-year note slipped 2/32, to 101 11/32, while its yield remained steady at 1.85 percent.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- They came to an opening night beer blast at the National Air and Space Museum, 4,000 strong in baseball caps and T-shirts, to look at the Wright Brothers' airplane and drink Citizen by DC Brau, which also makes a wryly named hometown brew, Corruption.
Craft beer brewers marched on Washington this week for their industry's first conference in the nation's capital. They were there to engage in a local pastime that goes pint in hand with drinking: lobbying. As part of the conference, hundreds of small-scale brewers met with Congressional staff members to press for a tax cut that they say would make it easier for them to brew more beer and hire more workers.
"For every 31 gallons that we brew, $7 goes to Uncle Sam," said Jeff Hancock, a co-founder of DC Brau, one of five craft breweries that have opened in the District of Columbia and its close suburbs in the last two years, joining dozens more in the rest of Virginia and Maryland.
Washington is just one of many places where craft brewing is booming.
"We are the victims of our own success," said Patrick Conway, owner of the Great Lakes Brewing Company in Cleveland. Mr. Conway brought a delegation of 12 employees to Washington to network and publicize his brews with tap takeovers at local bars. "We're always being courted by distributors," he said. "It's not our intention to sell in every state, but we are flattered."
The Brewers Association, which organized the conference, says 409 small breweries and brew pubs opened in the United States in 2012, up 18.5 percent from the year before. Craft beer's success defies the economic conditions businesses have faced since the recession, largely because it is considered an affordable luxury.
"Beer is sort of a recession-proof industry," said Jill McCluskey, a professor of agricultural economics at Washington State University. "In bad economic times, it's something that people can still afford."
With overall beer sales up 1 percent in 2012 after shrinking by about the same margin in 2011, most of the growth has been among specialty brewers. Their share of the market grew to 6.5 percent in 2012, from 5.7 percent in 2011. The $10.2 billion spent on craft beer represented 10.2 percent of money spent on all beer in 2012.
The small beer makers were out in full force at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center, the site of the Craft Brewers Conference, where they occupied 240,000 square feet, more than four football fields, for their trade show. Hop growers and malt makers began serving beers that used their products at 11:30 a.m. on Wednesday and Thursday while hundreds of the industry's suppliers displayed fermenters, tap handles and neon bar signs.
The growth has not been lost on politicians. The bipartisan House Small Brewers Caucus, which has 116 members from 35 states, has introduced the Small Brewer Reinvestment and Expanding Workforce Act, or Small BREW Act.
Commercial beer makers pay a federal tax on every barrel of beer they produce. It is a progressive tax: small breweries, producing fewer than two million barrels a year, pay $7 on their first 60,000 barrels. For every 31-gallon barrel above 60,000, they pay $18. Only about 100 craft breweries in the United States produce more than 15,000 barrels a year. About 95 percent of craft breweries and brew pubs produce less than that. Bigger brewers, like Anheuser-Busch InBev, which produced 98.5 million barrels in 2011, pay $18 for every barrel.
The Small BREW Act would reduce the tax on the first 60,000 barrels to $3.50. For every barrel beyond 60,000 but before two million, the tax would be $16. After two million, breweries would pay the full $18 tax. Any brewery that produces fewer than six million barrels a year -- which includes the bigger craft players, like the Boston Beer Company, maker of Samuel Adams, which turned out 2.7 million barrels last year -- would be eligible for the tax reduction.
Not everyone thinks the tax cut would be a good thing. The current tax levels were put in place in 1991 and have not changed since then. A rate that kept pace with inflation would make the taxes closer to $12 for small brewers and $30 for the big beer makers.
"The taxes that are included in the price of the beer do not begin to pay for the social costs of drinking," said Phillip J. Cook, a professor of economics and public policy at Duke University, who thinks the failure to keep up with inflation means beer is now too cheap. "It would be reasonable to let consumers decide what they wanted to drink and not to foster this segment of this particular industry through this kind of industrial policy or tax policy."
A report on reducing the nation's budget deficit from the Center for American Progress suggests raising the excise tax to about $50 a barrel of beer regardless of the brewery's size, which would bring in billions of dollars in additional revenue. If the Small BREW Act were to pass, it would cost the government $67 million a year at current levels, according to the Brewers Association.
Representative Jim Gerlach, a Pennsylvania Republican whose state is home to more than 100 small breweries, introduced the bill with Representative Richard E. Neal, a Massachusetts Democrat. Mr. Gerlach said the tax cut would have a positive economic impact because the brewers would use the windfall to expand. "They take every bit of loose change that they can get and plow it back into their operations," he said.
The economic impact on small brewers could be significant. But in most of Congress it is viewed as little more than a "rounding error," Bob Pease, the chief lobbyist for the Brewers' Association, said. The tax has little chance of being considered outside of broader tax reform legislation, he added.
Even without the tax cut, Mr. Pease says he thinks the growth of the craft beer industry is set to continue.
"They are going to hire people whether or not the bill passes," he said. There are more than 1,200 breweries in the planning stages; if those all went into business it would increase by more than 50 percent the 2,347 brew pubs and breweries currently operating.
But the growth of the industry has been so explosive that some in the industry now say that a slowdown is inevitable, regardless of what happens on the tax front.
"Eventually," said Herbert Sachs, the president of Saxco International, a company that makes glass bottles for the beer industry, "that ends in too much beer sloshing around."

Full text:   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The American economy grew at a faster rate at the end of last year than previously estimated, providing evidence that growth might have accelerated in early 2013 despite higher taxes and cuts in government spending.
The nation's gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 0.4 percent in the October-December quarter, the Commerce Department said on Thursday, slightly better than the previous growth estimate of 0.1 percent. The revision reflected stronger business investment and export sales.
Analysts say they think the economy is growing at a rate of around 2.5 percent in the current January-March quarter, which ends this week.
Steady hiring has kept consumers spending this year. A rebound in company stockpiling, further gains in housing and more business spending also likely drove faster growth in the first quarter.
The 0.4 percent growth rate for the gross domestic product, the economy's total output of goods and services, was the weakest quarterly performance in almost two years and followed a much faster 3.1 percent increase in the third quarter. The fourth quarter was hurt by the sharpest fall in military spending in 40 years.
For all of 2012, the economy grew 2.2 percent, after a 1.8 percent increase in 2011 and a 2.4 percent gain in 2010. Since the recession ended in mid-2009, the economy has expanded at subpar rates as a string of problems including higher gas prices and Europe's debt crisis has acted as a drag on the United States economy.
Growth appears to be strengthening this year even after taxes increased on Jan. 1 and automatic government spending cuts totaling $85 billion started to take effect on March 1. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the combination of tax increases and spending cuts could trim economic growth this year by about 1.5 percentage points. The office is predicting just 1.5 percent growth for 2013.
But the economy is showing signs of holding its own against the fiscal drag.
Employers have added an average of 200,000 jobs a month since November. That helped reduce the unemployment rate in February to 7.7 percent, a four-year low.
The number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits did rise by 16,000 last week, the second straight weekly increase. But the longer-term trend in layoffs remained consistent with an improved job market.
Applications rose to a seasonally adjusted 357,000 for the week ending March 23, the Labor Department said Thursday. That is an increase from 341,000 the previous week, which was revised slightly higher.
The four-week average, a less volatile measure, rose 2,250 to 343,000. Even with the gain, the average is only slightly higher than the five-year low of 340,750 attained the previous week. Economists pay closer attention to the four-week average because it smooths out week-to-week fluctuations.
The total number of people receiving some kind of unemployment aid is also down sharply. Nearly 5.5 million people were receiving unemployment aid as of the week ended March 9, the latest data available. That figure is up roughly 87,000 from the previous week but still well below the 7.2 million of a year earlier.
The government will release its initial look at first-quarter growth on April 26.

Full text:   RIO DE JANEIRO -- Brazil's oil production is falling, casting doubt on what was supposed to be an oil bonanza. Imports of gasoline are rising rapidly, exposing the country to the whims of global energy markets. Even the nation's ethanol industry, once envied as a model of renewable energy, has had to import ethanol from the United States.
Half a decade has passed since Brazilians celebrated the discovery of huge amounts of oil in deep-sea fields by the national oil company, Petrobras, triumphantly positioning the country to surge into the top ranks of global producers. But now another kind of energy shock is unfolding: the colossal company, long known for its might, is losing the race to keep up with the nation's growing energy demands.
Saddled with a nationalist mandate to buy ships, oil platforms and other equipment from lethargic Brazilian companies, the oil giant is now facing soaring debt, major projects mired in delays and older fields, once prodigious, that are yielding less oil. The undersea bounty in its grasp also remains devilishly complex to exploit.
Now, instead of symbolizing Brazil's rise as a global powerhouse, Petrobras embodies the sluggishness of the nation's economy itself, which, after racing ahead at 7.5 percent in 2010, slowed to less than 1 percent last year, eclipsed by growth in other Latin American nations like Mexico and Peru.
Until recently, Petrobras was second in value only to ExxonMobil among publicly traded energy companies. But its fortunes have tumbled to the point that it is now worth less than Colombia's national oil company. That fall has accentuated an increasingly bitter debate here over President Dilma Rousseff's attempts to use Petrobras to shield the Brazilian population from the nation's economic slowdown.
"Petrobras was once thought indestructible, but that is no longer the case," said Adriano Pires, a prominent Brazilian energy consultant. "Petrobras is now a tool of short-term economic policy, used to protect domestic industry from competition and fight inflation. This disastrous process will intensify if it is not reversed."
Ms. Rousseff, like her predecessor and political mentor, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, has relied heavily on state companies like Petrobras to create jobs and spur the economy. As a result, the president and her top advisers argue, unemployment remains near historic lows, an approach in economic management that contrasts sharply with Europe and the United States.
In a recent speech, Ms. Rousseff explained that her government's priority was lifting millions of Brazilians out of poverty.
"Those betting against us," she warned, "will suffer serious financial and political losses."
To bolster Ms. Rousseff's approval ratings going into a presidential election in 2014, Petrobras is building new refineries, pursuing offshore oil and buying most of its equipment from Brazilian companies, all of which have created tens of thousands of jobs and delivered some tangible political benefits.
"My life is better," said Adinael Soares Silva, 38, a welder at a Petrobras refinery under construction in Itaboraí, a city near Rio de Janeiro. He said he was pleased with his salary of about $800 a month. "Where I was, I didn't have enough to have a savings account," he said. "Now I do."
But while Petrobras has helped keep Brazil's unemployment low, around 5.4 percent, a growing chorus of critics points to the obvious problems at the company, including its backlog of projects and an inability to satisfy the country's thirst for oil, forcing it to import foreign gasoline and sell it at a loss.
After Brazil made its deep-sea oil discoveries in 2007, the government pushed to put Petrobras firmly in control of the new areas, a move that critics say could strain the company even further. It was a marked departure from the 1990s, when authorities ended Petrobras's monopoly as part of a radical restructuring of the economy. Petrobras remained under state control but was exposed to market forces, emerging as a hybrid nimbly competing with foreign oil companies.
Today, Petrobras seems far less nimble. In 2012, its production fell 2 percent, the first such decline in years.
The international energy industry is also changing, especially in the United States, as momentum shifts toward extracting oil and natural gas from onshore shale formations. Brazil is thought to have large shale reserves itself, but the government remains focused on its costly deep-sea megaprojects.
"The United States is redrawing the global petroleum map, while in Brazil euphoria has given way to inertia," Folha de São Paulo, one of Brazil's most influential newspapers, said in a recent editorial.
Compounding matters, Brazil's demand for gasoline surged about 20 percent in 2012, reflecting a car-manufacturing industry that has boomed partly as a result of government efforts to lift production.
Petrobras still lacks enough refineries able to process crude oil, forcing it to buy increasing amounts of gasoline from abroad. And it is still losing money on gasoline imports as the government keeps domestic fuel prices relatively low, to keep inflation from accelerating in a slow-growing economy.
Energy analysts contend that the government is using Petrobras to further its own political objectives. Ms. Rousseff's administration, for instance, has hewed to measures aimed at reviving the country's shipbuilding industry, by requiring Petrobras to buy many of its ships and oil platforms from Brazilian shipyards.
But these ventures have struggled with large cost overruns of their own, sometimes delivering vessels late or not at all, cutting into Petrobras's hopes of meeting ambitious production targets.
Then there are the delays at oil refineries under construction. One such complex, in Pernambuco State, was conceived in 2005 as a way for Brazil to forge closer political ties with oil-rich Venezuela. Eight years later, Venezuela has yet to invest in the project, which has faced various delays as Petrobras shoulders the entire cost of building it.
Describing the accumulation of problems at Petrobras, Exame, Brazil's top business magazine, bluntly accused the government of "destroying Brazil's largest company," accompanying the claim with an illustration of a fuel dispenser from a filling station in the shape of a noose.
The sense of dismay reflects, at least in part, Petrobras's stature. Founded in 1953, it wields clout from its Brutalist-style headquarters here in spheres well beyond the energy industry, sponsoring everything from literary festivals to the Carnival celebration in Salvador, a city in northeast Brazil.
Despite the challenges it faces, Petrobras remains profitable and much less constrained by political ideology than some other large national oil companies. In Mexico, for instance, Pemex has long retained its monopoly status despite production declines, and now the government is considering opening it to greater private investment.
Petrobras is also far more transparent than Petróleos de Venezuela, the national oil company that President Hugo Chávez, who died this month, transformed into an extremely politicized pillar of his government, purging it of thousands of employees after a bitter strike and forcing it to focus on new tasks like food distribution.
Maria das Graças Foster, the chief executive of Petrobras, has been exceptionally frank about the company's problems. In recent conference calls with analysts, she said that oil production should remain steady this year or perhaps even decline slightly again. But she also responded sharply to critics, claiming that output from the new deep-sea fields had reached 300,000 barrels a day. By 2020, the company expects to double overall production to 4.2 million barrels a day.
Other executives at the company have similarly sought to temper expectations that Brazil will enter a robust phase of energy independence.
José Carlos Cosenza, a Petrobras executive, has warned that Brazil may need to import large amounts of fuel for almost another decade. Moreover, gasoline demand is expected to climb even higher as Brazilians buy more cars.

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDEDLOS ANGELES -- Hollywood finally lured moviegoers out of their caves.
For the first time this year two movies arrived to $30 million or more in ticket sales in North America, giving studios hope that a dismal box-office stretch was behind them. "The Croods," about a prehistoric family's road trip, took in an estimated $44.7 million over the weekend, easily enough for No. 1, while "Olympus Has Fallen" took in a stronger-than-expected $30.5 million, for second place.
Even "Spring Breakers," Harmony Korine's lurid art-house tale of bikini-clad killers, lived up to its hype, taking in about $5 million in relatively limited national release.
Still, moviegoing in the United States and Canada remains deeply troubled. Ticket sales for the year to date total $2.06 billion, a 13 percent decline from the same period a year ago, according to Paul Dergarabedian, a box-office analyst for Hollywood.com. Attendance has fallen 14 percent.
Star-packed movies like "Gangster Squad" and "The Incredible Burt Wonderstone" have arrived to virtual shrugs. An expensive fantasy, "Jack the Giant Slayer," flopped outright. Movies aimed at men ("The Last Stand," "Broken City" and "21 & Over") have disappointed in assembly-line fashion.
One of the few exceptions, "Oz the Great and Powerful" from Walt Disney Studios, sold an additional $22 million in tickets over the weekend, placing third. "Oz" has now taken in $177.6 million in North America over three weeks. (Crucial overseas sales, however, have been soft.)
"The Call" (Sony) was fourth, selling about $8.7 million in tickets, for a two-week total of $30.9 million. "Admission," a new comedy starring Tina Fey and Paul Rudd, was an underwhelming fifth, taking in about $6.4 million. But it cost Focus Features only an estimated $13 million to make.
DreamWorks Animation urgently needed the cave people of "The Croods" to succeed. The studio's last release, "Rise of the Guardians," was a box-office failure, prompting an $87 million write-down. "The Croods" also represents the beginning of a new distribution partnership for DreamWorks Animation, which parted ways with Paramount Pictures late last year in favor of 20th Century Fox.
Opening-weekend results for "The Croods," which cost at least $135 million to make, are on par with "How to Train Your Dragon," also from DreamWorks with a March release date, which took in $46.5 million over its first three days in 2010 (after adjusting for inflation) and went on to gross about $500 million worldwide and spawn two sequels, a TV series and a live arena show. But "How to Train Your Dragon" also received much stronger reviews than "The Croods."
"Olympus Has Fallen," an R-rated White House action thriller starring Gerard Butler, cost Millennium Films about $70 million to make and was distributed by FilmDistrict. Aside from giving Mr. Butler's career a much-needed lift, the strong turnout puts pressure on Sony's similar "White House Down," planned for June release.
The inexpensive "Spring Breakers," distributed by A24, played in 1,104 theaters -- a huge release by independent film standards but a modest one compared with mainstream Hollywood. ("The Croods," for example, was booked into 4,046 theaters.) Mr. Korine, still best known for writing "Kids" (1995), has never had this kind of success as a director; his previous four films took in less than $500,000 combined.
Starring Selena Gomez, Vanessa Hudgens and James Franco and fueled by drugs, sex and violence, "Spring Breakers" was backed by an aggressive social media marketing campaign orchestrated by A24, an upstart distributor, and theAudience, a company partly owned by the William Morris Endeavor talent agency that seeks to build (and exploit) networks of fans across Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.
Correction: March 26, 2013, Tuesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Monday about movie ticket sales over the weekend misstated the ranking of the film "Admission" in some editions. As the article correctly noted, "The Call" sold about $8.7 million in tickets and ranked fourth and "Admission" took in about $6.4 million. Thus "Admission" was fifth, not fourth.

Full text:   Automatic spending cuts are a mindless way to budget, and they will leave the nation in the dark. Here's how: Under the cuts, the Census Bureau budget will be $845 million, well below the Obama administration's $970 million request. That will force the bureau to delay completion of the Economic Census, an immense survey done every five years that provides the benchmark measurements for economic growth and other vital indicators, including inflation and productivity. Without such data, policy makers, business leaders, investors, economists and social researchers will be at a disadvantage.
In fact, they already are. The last Economic Census was in 2007, which means that figures generated today are tied to data from before the recession. The responses to the 2012 survey would normally be analyzed by the fall of 2013. Under the budget cuts, the survey will not be finished until well into 2014.
Even then, it is unlikely to give a full picture of business ownership in America, including the types and numbers of businesses owned by veterans, women and minorities. Such detailed data collection is generally done late in the five-year cycle, which means that it may not be far enough along to finish under current constraints.
Without such specific data, there is no way to judge the performance of government efforts to broaden business opportunities, including loan programs and entrepreneurship training for veterans. Nor will it be possible to coherently analyze the problems of small businesses.
The cuts also come as the bureau is starting to test new methods for the 2020 decennial census, like using the Internet to replace expensive door-to-door surveying. In short, the cuts come just as the bureau's duties are ramping up. That is why the White House asked for extra money, and why the Republicans were wrong to deny it.

Full text:   THE first couple of years of economic recovery after the Great Recession were notable for one no-show.
The housing industry made no contribution at all.
Now it appears that industry is finally starting to recover. Housing starts are rising at a rapid rate, albeit from a very low level. And last year, residential construction spending, adjusted for inflation, climbed 12 percent, after declining for a record six consecutive years.
The Census Bureau reported this week that single-family housing starts rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 618,000 in February, the highest level since June 2008, months before the collapse of Lehman Brothers turned a recession into a global credit crisis.
Over the last 12 months, 551,000 single-family units were started, and an additional 255,000 multifamily units. As is shown in the accompanying charts, that was an increase of 28 percent from the period a year earlier. Not since the early 1980s, when the economy was coming out of a double-dip recession caused in large part by soaring interest rates that made homes unaffordable, had starts risen so rapidly.
But as can also be seen from the charts, the recovery has not propelled the housing industry far. The total level of starts is still lower than at any time before the recession, and in the fourth quarter of last year, the residential construction industry accounted for only 2.6 percent of the total gross domestic product. That figure was up from the low, reached in mid-2009, of just 2.2 percent, but it was far below the 6.3 percent reached in late 2005, when the housing bubble was at its peak.
The last time housing construction contributed so little to the economy was during World War II.
In normal economic recoveries, housing construction supplies a substantial part of the growth recorded in the first year or two after the recession ends. But in this recovery, it kept shrinking. Over all, real housing spending contracted in every year from 2006 to 2011. But the 12 percent gain last year was the fastest since 1993, another period of recovery.
The building industry, devastated by the collapse of the boom, is only starting to recover. The number of new homes offered for sale peaked at 570,000 in mid-2006, as the boom was ending, and many of the homes built then took years to sell. The latest figures show that only 150,000 new homes were offered for sale in January, including houses that are planned as well as those partly or completely built. That is up only a little from the low of 142,000 reached last summer.
The number of homes being offered before construction begins has remained close to level for two years at a little more than a quarter of the peak. That is a sign that few new communities have been started, despite the rise in housing starts.

Abstract: To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the committee expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens.

Full text:   Following is the text of the Federal Reserve's statement on Wednesday announcing it was holding its base federal funds target rate at a record low between zero and 0.25 percent:
Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January suggests a return to moderate economic growth following a pause late last year. Labor market conditions have shown signs of improvement in recent months but the unemployment rate remains elevated. Household spending and business fixed investment advanced, and the housing sector has strengthened further, but fiscal policy has become somewhat more restrictive. Inflation has been running somewhat below the committee's longer-run objective, apart from temporary variations that largely reflect fluctuations in energy prices. Longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.
Consistent with its statutory mandate, the committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic growth will proceed at a moderate pace and the unemployment rate will gradually decline toward levels the committee judges consistent with its dual mandate. The committee continues to see downside risks to the economic outlook. The committee also anticipates that inflation over the medium term likely will run at or below its 2 percent objective.
To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the committee decided to continue purchasing additional agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month and longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month. The committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. Taken together, these actions should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative.
The committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months. The committee will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability. In determining the size, pace, and composition of its asset purchases, the committee will continue to take appropriate account of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases as well as the extent of progress toward its economic objectives.
To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the committee expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens. In particular, the committee decided to keep the target range for the federal rate at 0 to ¼ percent and currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6 ½ percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored.
In determining how long to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, the committee will also consider other information, including additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments. When the committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent.
Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Ben S. Bernanke, chairman; William C. Dudley, vice chairman; James Bullard; Elizabeth A. Duke; Charles L. Evans; Jerome H. Powell; Sarah Bloom Raskin; Eric S. Rosengren; Jeremy C. Stein; Daniel K. Tarullo; and Janet L. Yellen. Voting against the action was Esther L. George, who was concerned that the continued high level of monetary accommodation increased the risks of future economic and financial imbalances and, over time, could cause an increase in long-term inflation expectations.

Full text:   RIVALING earlier American moguls who built elaborate edifices to house their art collections, magnates of the 21st century are pouring their fortunes into founding their own ambitious museums.
The flurry of building in recent years includes Eli Broad's contemporary art museum in Los Angeles; the musical instruments museum in Phoenix founded by Robert J. Ulrich, the former Target chief executive and chairman; the H. Ross Perot family's science museum in Dallas; Alice Walton's Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Arkansas; and -- an early example of the trend -- Paul Allen's rock 'n' roll museum in Seattle, which opened in 2000.
The trend coincides with a modest rise in arts philanthropy, with support up an inflation-adjusted 1 percent last year, according to the most recent Giving USA report, prepared by the Center on Philanthropy at Indiana University.
"We are a people who like making grand statements," said James R. Hackney, managing partner at Alexander Haas, an Atlanta-based fund-raising consultant to cultural institutions, "and we are in a time where people have great wealth, like the golden age of the 1880s or the 1920s."
The $13.2 billion given to the arts, culture and the humanities in 2011, the Giving USA report noted, was lifted by an $800 million Walton Family Foundation endowment for Crystal Bridges, "the largest cash donation ever recorded to an art museum in the United States."
Although only 4 percent of charitable giving goes to arts and other cultural groups, the attraction of leaving a legacy by founding a museum endures, said Robert Grimm, the director at the University of Maryland Center for Philanthropy and Nonprofit Leadership.
"Philanthropists today have been entrepreneurs and innovators in their fields, and they continue to want to be engaged and leave their mark," he said. "Most people remember John D. Rockefeller and Andrew Carnegie, because of the buildings and the 3,000 libraries, but few know who Julius Rosenwald was," Mr. Grimm said of the man who co-owned Sears, Roebuck & Company.
Rosenwald, despite his cultural philanthropy, left "no physical symbol to remind us of his contributions," Mr. Grimm said. "If there were, more people would probably know about him. If your name is on something, there is a tendency for it to be remembered."
Today's museum builders say they are providing valuable cultural additions to communities, including some areas that have long been lacking in such institutions.
Yet there are critics of the practice. The phrase "vanity project" is sometimes associated with people who believe their collections are unique and should remain permanently intact in their own buildings. In addition, such museums can be a "significant loss to the existing museum fabric" by draining away money, said Barry Lord, co-founder of Lord Cultural Resources, a global museum consultant.
"But it's a whole different matter if the primary motivation is trying to focus attention on an area of art, rather than a cultural institution built only to draw attention to one collector's effort," he said.
Enshrining individual art collections in free-standing buildings had its heyday early last century with collectors like Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, but it never completely died off. In 1961, the Amon Carter was opened in Fort Worth to house paintings by Frederic Remington and other noted American artists owned by Mr. Carter, a newspaper publisher. Other major collectors have given their art to existing institutions.
But a museum founder "cuts a bigger swath and draws more recognition," said Mr. Lord, "rather than having the art swallowed up in a larger institution and probably sitting in storage for most of the time."
The cost can be daunting, said Mr. Lord, whose "Manual of Museum Planning 2012" advises would-be founders to calculate $800 to $1,000 a square foot to build a museum. And he warns that costs jump from there depending on factors like the thickness of walls.
"It's seldom less than an $80 million investment," Mr. Lord concluded, and requires a separate, often substantial, operating budget.
Despite this, the new museums are notable for grandeur.
For example, Crystal Bridges, designed by the architect Moshe Safdie, takes up 201,000 square feet on a 120-acre wooded site in Walmart's home base, Bentonville, Ark. At any one time, the museum displays 450 to 500 works by notable artists like Gilbert Stuart, George Bellows and Norman Rockwell.
The museum, which has an annual operating budget of $18 million, employs more than 125 people. In its first year, 2012, it had more than 600,000 visitors. Ms. Walton, whose $21 billion net worth makes her the eighth-richest person in the United States, according to 2012 Forbes calculations, has collected American art for more than two decades and chose her home area to provide a cultural institution in an area without one, she has said.
"At Crystal Bridges we share the story of America through outstanding artworks, in a setting that highlights the beauty of our region," she said. Her focus is to make the museum "accessible to everyone," she added, so admission is free and school field trips, including buses and lunch, are paid for.
Neither Ross Perot, a donor to cultural, medical and educational causes, nor his family are noted collectors and the family "had rarely put their name on anything," said Carolyn Perot Rathjen, one of Mr. Perot's five children and chairman of the board of the Perot Museum of Nature and Science. But Ms. Rathjen and her siblings -- their father is No. 113 on the Forbes wealthiest list -- put in $50 million for the $185 million museum, which opened last year.
"The content is very broad," said Ms. Rathjen of the exhibits, which include fossils and a solar system at the museum designed by Thom Mayne. "So we saw this as offering great experience for the whole family, and for students coming here on field trips."
Not all the museums are in hometowns. Mr. Ulrich, the former Target executive, lives mostly in Minneapolis, but he decided to found the Musical Instrument Museum in Phoenix, largely because of its tourist-friendly location.
"I was sitting in a cafe in Brussels, Belgium, after the third time I had seen the musical instruments museum there," he said, "and I began talking to my friend about how we might create a museum that would include music from everywhere in the world and be totally unique. That was the challenge."
Mr. Ulrich provided more than $100 million for the $250 million museum, which was designed by Richard Varda and opened in 2010. It displays some 5,000 instruments, both on loan and owned, and extends over 200,000 square feet on a 20-acre site.
"We do have treasures, but it's touching, playing and hearing these instruments that's the primary focus," he said. "It's an experience of pure joy."

Fed to Maintain Stimulus Efforts Despite Jobs Growth

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Employment has been increasing at a healthy clip for the last few months, but the Federal Reserve is not ready to relax just yet.
"We need to see sustained improvement," the Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said at a news conference on Wednesday. "One or two months doesn't cut it. So we're just going to have to keep providing support for the economy and see how things evolve."
The Fed's policy-making committee said much the same thing in a stilted statement issued just before Mr. Bernanke took questions, announcing that it would continue to hold down short-term interest rates and buy $85 billion a month in Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities.
Mr. Bernanke's remarks suggested that the Fed would reduce its asset purchases if job growth continued at the current pace, the first time he has said that the central bank is likely to reduce the amount of monthly purchases before it stops buying entirely.
But such a change remains at least a few months away, and quite possibly longer. The Fed is wary of pulling back too soon, a mistake it has already made several times in recent years. It is waiting to assess the impact of the federal spending cuts that began this month. And Mr. Bernanke said the members of the Federal Open Market Committee, which makes policy for the Fed, "have not been able to come to an agreement" about the goals of the asset purchases or, by extension, when they should end.
Mr. Bernanke, who has made job growth the Fed's top priority for the first time in its 100-year history, spoke about the issue in personal terms. Asked when he last had spoken to an unemployed person, he said that one of his own relatives was out of work.
"I come from a small town in South Carolina that has taken a big hit from the recession," Mr. Bernanke said. "The last time I was there, the unemployment rate was about 15 percent. The home I was raised in had just been foreclosed upon. I have a great concern for the unemployed, both for their own sake but also because the loss of skills and the loss of labor force attachment is bad for our whole economy."
Mr. Bernanke also may have provided some insight into his own future. Asked repeatedly about his interest in a third term as Fed chairman, Mr. Bernanke demurred several times before telling one reporter, "I've spoken to the president a bit but I really don't have any information for you at this juncture."
The Fed said last year that it planned to hold short-term interest rates near zero at least as long as the unemployment rate remained above 6.5 percent. The rate stood at 7.7 percent in February and has barely budged in half a year. Most economic forecasters do not expect the threshold to be reached before 2015.
The asset purchases are intended as a short-term measure to catalyze faster job growth; the Fed has said it will slow increasing its collection of Treasuries and mortgage bonds, a policy known as "quantitative easing," once it is convinced that employment is increasing at a sustainable pace.
The unusual rigidity of this basic course has diminished the importance of the Fed's regular meetings, and it has to some extent created a problem of foreshortening. The next change in policy is necessarily the major subject of discussion among Fed officials, analysts and investors. But that may make the next change seem nearer than it really is. It is quite possible that the year could pass without any significant change.
"In one line: Sustainability, sustainability, sustainability," Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomic Advisors, wrote in a note to clients. "Mr. Bernanke clearly does not want even to consider slowing Q.E. until he is convinced that any such run of strength now is a permanent shift."
The decision, of course, does not rest with Mr. Bernanke alone. And he noted on Wednesday that there was no consensus on the policy-making committee about how much longer asset purchases should continue. "We've not been able to come to an agreement about what guidance we should give," he said.
As is often the case, Fed officials are not just debating how to respond to economic circumstances. They are debating the nature of those circumstances.
The economy has grown more robustly in recent months -- the committee hailed "a return to moderate economic growth following a pause late last year" -- and job growth has increased since the Fed began its latest stimulus campaign in September.
But even as spending by consumers and businesses drives growth, the Fed noted that fiscal policy "has become somewhat more restrictive."
"The committee continues to see downside risks to the economic outlook," the statement said.
The Fed separately released economic forecasts by 19 of its senior officials showing that their expectations had actually soured slightly. They predicted growth of 2.3 percent to 2.8 percent this year, down from a forecast in December of 2.3 percent to 3 percent. The consensus forecast for 2014 also fell. Officials now expect growth of 2.9 percent to 3.4 percent in 2014, compared with a December forecast of growth from 3 percent to 3.5 percent.
Concerns about inflation remained in abeyance. Fed officials do not expect inflation above 2 percent over the next three years, well below their self-imposed ceiling of 2.5 percent inflation. At the same time, officials were modestly more optimistic about job growth. They predicted that the unemployment rate would rest between 6.7 and 7 percent at the end of 2014. In December, they predicted that the rate would sit between 6.8 and 7.3 percent at the end of 2014.
Against concerns that the pace of growth remains subpar, the Fed continues to weigh the possibility that its efforts will destabilize financial markets by encouraging excessive risk-taking.
So far, support on the committee for the stimulus remains strong. The decision to press forward was supported by 11 of the 12 voting members of the Federal Open Market Committee. Esther L. George, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, recorded the only dissent, as she did in January, citing concerns about stability and future inflation.

Abstract: Mr. Bernanke and the Fed's vice chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, "have been abundantly clear in recent commentary that the improvement in the labor market to date falls far short of what they will need to see before reducing monetary policy accommodation," Joseph LaVorgna, chief United States economist at Deutsche Bank, wrote last week in a note to clients.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Each time in recent years that the Federal Reserve has paused in its efforts to stimulate the economy, it has come to regret the decision as premature. Its leading officials say the recovery has been slower as a consequence of those pauses. It is a mistake they do not want to repeat.
When the Fed's policy-making committee meets on Tuesday and Wednesday, its members are likely to spend a lot of time talking about the potential costs of the current stimulus campaign. Then the Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, will probably seek to reassure investors that the Fed plans to press on.
The central bank is buying $85 billion a month in Treasury and mortgage-backed securities because it wants unemployment to fall more quickly. While recent economic data suggests that growth is quickening, Mr. Bernanke has said that the situation remains unacceptable and that the pace of progress is uncertain.
Mr. Bernanke and the Fed's vice chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, "have been abundantly clear in recent commentary that the improvement in the labor market to date falls far short of what they will need to see before reducing monetary policy accommodation," Joseph LaVorgna, chief United States economist at Deutsche Bank, wrote last week in a note to clients.
Also, the federal government has just embarked on another round of spending cuts, known as sequestration, and the extent of the resulting drag on the economy may not be evident for several months.
"The Fed will not take overt steps to scale back its asset purchases any time soon," Lou Crandall, chief economist at Wrightson ICAP, a New York-based financial research firm, wrote last week. "The Fed is not going to take any chances until it is sure that we have avoided another spring/summer swoon."
The central bank has said that it plans to hold short-term interest rates near zero at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6.5 percent. It was 7.7 percent in February. The asset purchases are intended to hasten the arrival of that moment by further reducing long-term borrowing costs for businesses and consumers.
Mr. Bernanke built a broad consensus among Fed officials last year in favor of taking both steps, and analysts say that supporters of the policy remain firmly in the majority of the Fed's 12-member Federal Open Market Committee. Only one official dissented at the most recent meeting in January.
But Fed officials who disagree with the policy, including some who do not hold votes on the committee this year, have become increasingly vocal in their criticisms. And among officials who support the purchases, there is disagreement about how much longer the Fed should keep its foot on the gas.
The focus of those concerns has shifted from the remote threat of inflation to the possibility that low interest rates could destabilize financial markets, in part by encouraging investors to take outsize risks.
Such concerns can dilute the impact of the Fed's efforts by causing investors to doubt how much longer rates will remain low. In response, Mr. Bernanke and other supporters of the current policies have tried in recent weeks to persuade markets that the purchases will continue because the benefits far outweigh the potential costs. Indeed, Mr. Bernanke argued recently that pulling back could pose even larger risks to stability by weakening the economy.
"In light of the moderate pace of the recovery and the continued high level of economic slack, dialing back accommodation with the goal of deterring excessive risk-taking in some areas poses its own risks to growth, price stability and, ultimately, financial stability," he said this month. "Indeed, as I noted, a premature removal of accommodation could, by slowing the economy, perversely serve to extend the period of low long-term rates."
In seeking to persuade markets that it plans to press forward, the Fed must also contend with evidence that the economy is gaining strength. Fed officials projected in December that the economy would expand 2.8 percent to 3.2 percent this year, the fastest growth since the recession. Analysts expect an updated forecast on Wednesday to be modestly more optimistic.
The Fed has said that it will continue to stimulate the economy for an unusually extended period, even as the recovery gains strength. Since the benefits of that policy depend on its credibility, it is searching for ways to communicate more clearly with investors so that expectations of its eventual retreat do not become a premature drag on growth.
"At this stage in the business cycle, central bankers obsess that market participants will expect policy tightening to come sooner and more sharply than is consistent with sustained economic expansion," said Vincent R. Reinhart, chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley.

Full text:   FIVE years into the Great Depression, one out of five workers in the United States was unemployed. The economy was nearly 20 percent smaller in 1934 than it had been at the peak, in 1929.
The Greeks can only wish they had it so good.
The Greek government this week released its estimate of economic output in the fourth quarter of last year, and also published its unemployment report.
For the year as a whole, the Greek economy, measured in 2005 euros, fell to 168.5 billion euros, down 6.4 percent from the previous year. That was a little better than the 7.1 percent decline in 2011. The last time the Greek economy was smaller than in 2012 was in 2001. The cumulative decline since 2007 was 20.1 percent.
In December, the unemployment rate was 26.4 percent, and that figure actually looked a little encouraging because it was lower than the 26.6 percent reported for November. Not since May 2008, when the rate fell half a percentage point to 7.3 percent, had there been a single month when the unemployment rate was reported to have fallen.
The accompanying charts compare the changes in gross domestic product and unemployment in the United States during the five years after 1929 with the changes in Greece during the five years after 2007.
There is reason to take all the numbers with a grain of salt. The American figures were estimated after the fact, by the government for G.D.P. and by the National Bureau of Economic Research for unemployment. For G.D.P., only annual changes were estimated.
The Hellenic Statistics Authority, Greece's compiler of official numbers, has a history of deception -- the country lied to get into the euro zone -- and it now cannot apply seasonal adjustments to its quarterly G.D.P. estimates. As a result, the figures shown in the charts are calculated by adding up the four quarters of each year. But European officials now vouch for the quality of Greek figures.
Perhaps the most telling difference between the course of the two economies comes in government consumption spending -- basically spending that is not for investment, as in building roads or bombers. In the United States, that spending was growing even under President Herbert Hoover and helped to cushion the economy's fall. In Greece, required by Europe to follow a course of harsh austerity, that spending has fallen rapidly, even if it has not declined as rapidly as some Europeans want.
By the fifth year of the Depression, personal consumption spending had begun to recover in the United States. In Greece last year, it fell 9.1 percent, more than in any other year of the downturn.
Greece publishes monthly overall unemployment figures, but provides details only on a quarterly basis. The charts show the trends of joblessness by sex and age group through the third quarter of last year, the most recent available. Women are more likely to be unemployed in every age group shown, and older workers are far less likely to be jobless than younger ones. Even the groups that look good by comparison are doing poorly. Among men age 45 to 64, nearly one in six is out of work. Among men 30 to 44, the figure is one in five.
Rates for teenagers and people over 65 are not shown, since few of them are in the labor force. The picture is glum for those teenagers who do want jobs. The male unemployment rate is 52 percent, and the rate for women is 81.5 percent. Most of those over 65 who say they want to work do have jobs, but the proportion of such people in the labor force has been falling in recent years.

Populations Of U.S. Fish Rebound

Abstract: [...]many other New England fish were recovering more slowly, mostly because of overfishing and environmental problems, Mr. Sewell said. [...]recently, he said, New England regulators had set targets only for total catches instead of setting strict quotas under which any excess catch would be deducted from the following year's quota.

Full text:   Many commercial fishing stocks off the United States coast that were depleted by decades of overfishing are returning to abundance, thanks largely to a 1996 law that effectively ordered limits on catches until the fish populations had rebounded, a newly released analysis of federal data on fish populations states.
The analysis, by the Natural Resources Defense Council, concludes that 21 of 44 species that it studied have met rebuilding targets and 7 others have made significant progress, increasing their populations by at least 25 percent.
Sixteen have made less or no progress, the report stated, including 10 species off the New England coast, most of them popular bottom-dwelling fish like cod and flounder. In half of those cases, the fish populations had grown by more than 25 percent but were still being overfished.
All have been managed under the 1996 law, the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, which sets a 10-year target for rebuilding each species.
Brad Sewell, a lawyer for the resources group and the main author of the analysis, said the uptick in fish populations was especially impressive in light of what he called a dismal record in most other parts of the world.
"When you look at the population trajectories of dozens and dozens of stocks, you see '96 as a real watershed," he said. "You see this cause and effect between implementing the law and the upward population trajectory."
The report noted that between 2008 and 2010, the average revenues from catches of the 28 fish that made the most rebuilding progress had jumped 54 percent, allowing for inflation, from the start of their rebuilding.
The report's calculations are based entirely on annual reports on fish stocks issued by the National Marine Fisheries Service. The service has labeled 124 species overfished, but the report focused on 44 for which there were enough data to draw conclusions on their rebuilding progress.
Mid-Atlantic fish stocks reported the most progress; all seven species examined had met population targets, including bluefish, black sea bass and summer flounder. Many New England stocks also recovered fully, including sea scallops, haddock, monkfish and yellowtail flounder.
But many other New England fish were recovering more slowly, mostly because of overfishing and environmental problems, Mr. Sewell said. Until recently, he said, New England regulators had set targets only for total catches instead of setting strict quotas under which any excess catch would be deducted from the following year's quota.
Six of the eight species that made the least progress are off New England, including Atlantic cod, winter flounder and ocean pout. And even some species making slightly better progress, like the slow-growing Atlantic halibut, could take decades to rebuild, he said.
"They were the size of small boats, and they virtually went extinct," he said. "They're coming back. But it will be a long haul."

Full text:   10:58 p.m. | Updated
The government's multiyear campaign to ferret out insider trading on Wall Street has yielded multiple prosecutions of former employees of SAC Capital Advisors, the giant hedge fund owned by the billionaire investor Steven A. Cohen.
On Friday, federal authorities took aim at the fund itself.
In what officials are calling the largest-ever settlement of an insider trading action, SAC agreed to pay securities regulators about $602 million to resolve a civil lawsuit related to improper trading at the fund.
The landmark penalty exceeds, at least before adjustment for inflation, the fines meted out in the 1980s-era scandals involving Ivan F. Boesky and Michael R. Milken, records at the time. It also underscores SAC's central role in the government's recent push to prosecute illegal conduct on trading desks and in executive suites, an effort that has yielded about 180 civil actions and more than 75 criminal prosecutions.
SAC also agreed Friday to pay $14 million to resolve its role in an insider trading ring that illegally traded technology stocks including Dell.
"These settlements call for the imposition of historic penalties," said George S. Canellos, the Securities and Exchange Commission's acting enforcement director.
Mr. Canellos said the resolutions did not prevent the future filing of additional charges against any person, specifically citing Mr. Cohen, who was not named as a defendant in the civil actions on Friday. Mr. Cohen has not been charged with any wrongdoing and has told his clients that he believes he has behaved properly.
In the bigger case, the agency said an SAC unit would forfeit $602 million to settle claims that it sold nearly $1 billion in shares of two pharmaceutical companies after a former portfolio manager at the fund received secret information from a doctor about problems with a new drug for Alzheimer's disease.
For SAC, which is based in Stamford, Conn., manages $15 billion and holds one of the best investment records on Wall Street, the settlements, while another blow to its reputation, resolve a matter that caused some of its investors to withdraw their money. Investors became skittish last fall after regulators warned SAC that they planned to sue the fund.
"These settlements are a substantial step toward resolving all outstanding regulatory matters and allow the firm to move forward," said Jonathan Gasthalter, a spokesman for SAC.
The settlements still need to be approved by Judge Victor Marrero of Federal District Court in Manhattan, the presiding judge in the case. As part of its agreement with regulators, SAC neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing. That entrenched S.E.C. practice -- permitting defendants to settle civil claims without acknowledging wrongdoing -- has come under increased scrutiny by the courts, a trend that legal experts say could lead the judge to question the settlement.
The cases brought on Friday echo earlier criminal charges against SAC employees. In December, prosecutors indicted Mathew Martoma, a former SAC portfolio manager at the center of the questionable drug-stock trades tied to a new Alzheimer's drug. And Jon Horvath, a former SAC analyst, pleaded guilty last year to participating in the Dell insider trading ring. In its legal filing on Friday, the S.E.C. said Mr. Horvath had leaked secret information to two colleagues; previously, the commission said that only one former SAC employee had received tips.
A lawyer for Mr. Martoma said SAC's resolution of the two lawsuits had no bearing on his client, who has denied the charges.
"SAC's business decision to settle with the S.E.C. in no way changes the fact that Mathew Martoma is an innocent man," said Charles A. Stillman, the lawyer. "We will never give up our fight for his vindication."
On a conference call with reporters, government officials bragged that the $616 million amount dwarfed other prominent insider trading settlements. Raj Rajaratnam, a former hedge fund manager convicted in 2011, paid $156 million in combined criminal and civil penalties. Mr. Boesky, a central figure in the 1980s trading scandals, paid $100 million then.
The sum also exceeds the amounts of older enforcement actions, including a $550 million settlement with Goldman Sachs in 2010 related to fraud accusations tied to the sale of mortgage investments, and a $400 million settlement with Mr. Milken, the junk bond financier, in 1990.
The larger of the two cases settled on Friday was based on powerful evidence against Mr. Martoma, the former SAC portfolio manager. The government said Mr. Martoma had caused SAC to sell nearly $1 billion in shares of Elan and Wyeth because he obtained secret information from a doctor about clinical trials for a drug being developed by the companies. Prosecutors have secured the testimony of the doctor who reportedly leaked Mr. Martoma the drug trial data.
In bringing the criminal charge against Mr. Martoma, prosecutors appeared to be moving closer to building a case against Mr. Cohen. The complaint noted that Mr. Cohen had a 20-minute phone call with Mr. Martoma the night before SAC began dumping its holdings. Prosecutors, though, have not claimed that Mr. Cohen knew that Mr. Martoma had confidential data about the drug's prospects.
The F.B.I. has tried unsuccessfully several times to persuade Mr. Martoma to plead guilty and cooperate against Mr. Cohen.
While the $602 million settlement in the Martoma case is a prodigious sum, it is considerably less than the maximum that the S.E.C. could have extracted. The agreement required SAC to pay about $275 million, an amount representing disgorged illegal gains, as well as $52 million in interest. In addition, SAC agreed to pay a $275 million penalty, an amount equal to the illicit gains. Under the securities laws, however, the S.E.C. could have secured a penalty of three times that amount, or $825 million.
The forfeited money will come from SAC, meaning that the firm will write the government a check. SAC's investors will not pay anything or absorb any losses. The $616 million will go into a general revenue fund of the United States Treasury.
Representing SAC in its talks with the S.E.C. were Martin Klotz of Willkie Farr & Gallagher and Daniel J. Kramer of Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison.
While the resolution of these two cases provides a measure of relief to SAC and its clients, the hedge fund's legal problems have already damaged its business. Though SAC has returned about 30 percent annually to its investors over the last two decades -- a virtually peerless track record -- many of its clients have parted ways with the fund.
Last month, SAC investors asked to withdraw $1.7 billion, more than a quarter of the $6 billion that the fund manages for outside clients. The balance of SAC's $15 billion belongs to Mr. Cohen and his employees. The next regularly scheduled deadline for SAC clients to ask for their money back is mid-May.
In calls with concerned clients, SAC has highlighted its stepped-up efforts in building its legal staff and compliance procedures -- an initiative that Mr. Gasthalter reiterated Friday. "We are committed to continuing to maintain a first-rate compliance effort woven into the fabric of the firm."
On a conference call discussing the case, Mr. Canellos was asked whether the S.E.C. felt that SAC was committed to keeping a strong culture of compliance.
"I sure hope they are," Mr. Canellos said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text:   BUENOS AIRES -- Pope Francis was celebrated here on Thursday by faithful congregants and priests in some of this capital city's vast slums as he started his papacy on an austere note, shunning the throne reserved for him at the Vatican, but the praise was tempered by criticism of him for his hard-line conservative views on a range of issues, including gay rights and artistic expression.
The streets of Buenos Aires, where Francis, formerly Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio, was archbishop until Wednesday, captured the sense of ambivalence over the first Argentine to be named to head the Vatican. Thousands flooded into parts of the city, snarling traffic and bellowing into loudspeakers -- not to champion their new pope but to protest for increases in salaries and antipoverty benefits in a country with galloping inflation.
At the Metropolitan Cathedral here, a steady but far from overwhelming stream of the devout and curious filed inside, where José de San Martín, a leader in the independence struggle against Spain, is entombed. At the entrance, some stopped before a computer-printed photograph of Francis under the words "Habemus Papam," Latin for "We have a pope."
"We've sold almost nothing," said Daniel Martínez, 50, who was selling buttons with the new pontiff's picture displayed on a jersey of Argentina's national soccer team. "If Argentina had won the World Cup, the plaza would be full. Since it's the ascension of the pope, people take it more calmly."
Gay rights groups were far from calm in their reaction to Francis, with one organization, the Argentine Federation of Lesbians, Gays, Bisexuals and Transsexuals, pointing out that he had described a plan to legalize same-sex marriage as a "plan of the devil." The group called his selection as pope a "radicalization of the Vatican's position against recognizing diverse families."
Similarly, León Ferrari, one of Argentina's most prominent conceptual artists, called the selection of Francis as pope a "horror" in an interview with the Brazilian newspaper Folha de São Paulo. In the 1990s, Francis clashed with Mr. Ferrari over an exposition of his work that included a piece depicting Jesus crucified on a United States Air Force fighter jet.
Elsewhere, however, parishioners who said their lives were changed by Francis spoke warmly of his selection. In a parish called Virgin of the Miracles of Caacupé, in an area of slums in southern Buenos Aires with uncompleted brick houses along potholed alleys, a 13-year-old boy, Walter Nuñez, said he was proud to know Francis.
"He would come on some Sundays and look after me," said Mr. Nuñez, who at age 2 was adopted into a family of nine when his mother died. At age 8, he was baptized by Francis. "He was a common man," he said. "He was like all of us."
Indeed, Francis is well known throughout Buenos Aires for his crusading work among the poor and vulnerable. The Rev. José Juan Cervantes, 42, said Francis began an initiative in 2008 to assist victims of human trafficking, insisting on being called Father Jorge when he came to the crime-ridden district of Constitución each year to celebrate Mass in an open-air plaza.
One of the most biting reactions to Francis came in a statement from the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo, the association of women whose children were disappeared during Argentina's military dictatorship, from 1976 to 1983. The group contrasted Francis, who has long been criticized for not confronting the dictatorship, with the 150 or so other priests who were killed during the so-called Dirty War.
"About this pope they named, we have only to say, 'Amen,' " Hebe de Bonafini, the group's president and a longstanding critic of the incoming pope, said in a statement steeped in irony.

Full text:   The Dow Jones industrial average extended its winning streak to 10 days on Thursday and ended at another nominal high as investors were encouraged by data showing that the labor market's recovery was improving.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index made a late-day run at its nominal closing high, set in October 2007, but it ended two points away. The Dow industrials have been setting nominal highs, unadjusted for inflation, since March 5, when they surpassed a high also set in October 2007.
The last time the Dow rose for 10 consecutive days was November 1996.
Stocks have accelerated their rally without a major consolidation since the start of the year, driven by improvement in the economy and the Federal Reserve's continuation of its easy monetary policy.
So far this year, the Dow is up nearly 11 percent, while the S.& P. 500 is up 9.6 percent.
"It's simply a natural progression for prices to move to new highs in order for the market to advance. I don't think it's scaring investors," said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of the Solaris Group.
"Fund flows really have reversed direction, and money started moving out of money markets, and some from fixed income to equities," Mr. Ghriskey said. "This kind of trend doesn't change easily, so we can expect a lot more to come in."
The Dow industrials gained 83.86 points, or 0.6 percent, to 14,539.14. The S.& P. 500 rose 8.71 points, or 0.6 percent, to 1,563.23.
The Nasdaq composite index advanced 13.81 points, or 0.4 percent, to end at 3,258.93, still well below its nominal high of 5,000, reached in the dot-com boom in 2000.
Data on Thursday provided fresh signs of strength in the United States labor market as the number of new filings for unemployment benefits fell for the third consecutive week.
Ten of the Dow's 30 stocks hit at least 52-week highs, including Walt Disney. I.B.M.'s shares hit a high of $215.80, up $3.74, or 1.8 percent.
Energy shares led the Dow and the S.& P. 500 higher, with the S.& P. energy sector index gaining 1.3 percent. Chevron was among the Dow's biggest percentage gainers, rising $1.64, or 1.4 percent, to $120.
After the bell, the Federal Reserve released scores for 18 bank holding companies that showed how low their capital ratios would fall under proposed plans for dividends and stock buybacks if "severely adverse" economic conditions unfolded over the next two years. JPMorgan Chase shares fell 2 percent in extended-hours trading, while Goldman Sachs fell 1.9 percent.
During the regular session, Apple rose $4.15, or 1 percent, to $432.50, even though its rival, Samsung Electronics, introduced a new Galaxy smartphone on Thursday.
Shares of eBay, operator of one of the largest online marketplaces, climbed 82 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $51.80 after Evercore Partners raised its rating on the company to overweight.
On the downside, shares of Amazon, the world's biggest Internet retailer, fell $9.36, or 3.4 percent, to $265.74 after JPMorgan cut its rating to neutral from overweight and reduced its price target to $300 from $333.
E*Trade shares lost 97 cents, or 8.2 percent, to $10.85 after Citadel, the company's largest investor, said it was selling its stake in the company.
In the bond market, interest rates moved modestly higher. The price of the Treasury's 10-year note slipped 4/32, to 99 22/32, while its yield rose to 2.04 percent from 2.02 percent late Wednesday.

Full text:   Gov. Andrew Cuomo and state legislative leaders are hammering out the $142 billion state budget for the 2013-14 fiscal year, which must be approved by April 1. It is crucial that more financing be allocated to public schools, both in upstate areas and in New York City.
Many poorer school districts, especially those upstate, are suffering from financial problems created by the property tax cap that was championed by Mr. Cuomo and imposed by Albany lawmakers in 2011. The problem in New York City, which has no tax cap, is different. Mr. Cuomo and legislators threatened to cut at least $240 million in state aid to the city because Mayor Michael Bloomberg and the teachers' union failed to produce a new evaluation system for teachers by a January deadline. Surely, he must realize that hurting the schools will not lead to better outcomes for children, which is the purpose of creating rigorous teacher evaluation systems.
Smaller districts are in great need of more state aid. As predicted, the state law that caps the annual increase in property taxes at 2 percent or the inflation rate, unless 60 percent of the voters agree to more, has hit hardest on some of the poorest school districts. The current formula for allotting school aid is skewed to help districts of politically powerful legislators; it should be changed to spread more money to impoverished areas. Ultimately, lawmakers will also have to find a better source of revenue for schools than property taxes.
In a recent lawsuit, the New York State United Teachers and parents from several school districts offer some alarming details. Some districts have cut science and social studies teachers, dropped advanced placement classes and eliminated summer school programs. The Elmira City School District -- where more than half of its 7,000 students are eligible for free and reduced-price lunches -- failed to get 60 percent of voters to agree to a bigger tax increase. As a result of the vote and the loss of state aid, school leaders had to cut 126 of 1,220 positions, including 10 foreign language teachers and 12 reading teachers.
In negotiations over the state budget, lawmakers will have to deal with many important priorities, including a higher minimum wage for workers and more state aid for struggling cities and towns. Depriving poor communities and New York City of education funds would be particularly counterproductive.

Full text:   TOKYO -- In the late 1990s, in the thick of the Asian financial crisis, a top Japanese Finance Ministry official turned to his protégé and found him engrossed not in policy documents, but in a chunky volume of the works of Aristotle.
That bookish aide, Haruhiko Kuroda, was approved on Friday to become the next Bank of Japan governor, one of the most thankless jobs in a country plagued for decades with economic problems. He will need more than Aristotelian logic to turn years of the central bank's policies on their head.
The Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, who took office in December, has pointed his finger at the central bank and its seemingly hapless monetary decision-making as the root cause of the country's economic woes. The bank must take a far tougher stance against deflation, Mr. Abe has demanded, to stem the sluggish profits, spending and investment that have weighed on the Japanese economy since the 1990s.
Mr. Kuroda, 68, is tasked with bringing about a regime change at the bank, something he himself, a critic of the bank, has previously called for. His track record of disparaging the central bank for not doing more to fight deflation as well as a career that has spanned the stodgy halls of Japanese bureaucracy and the negotiation tables of global finance convinced Mr. Abe that he was the man for the job, officials say.
"Speed is of the utmost importance," Mr. Kuroda told a parliamentary hearing earlier this week. "I intend to pursue bold monetary easing, both in scale and in quality."
It will be a tough job, though one that offers a chance to right the Bank of Japan's blemished history of missteps and blunders in attempting to right one of the world's major economies.
The Bank of Japan's woes reach back to the mid-1980s, when it lowered interest rates to prop up an economy reeling from a rapidly strengthening yen. And despite signs that the easy money was helping to fuel a spectacular bubble economy, the bank kept interest rates low, finally tightening policy in 1989. By that time, stock and land prices had more than quadrupled from five years earlier.
The painful memories of the collapse of that bubble and the drawn-out economic pain it has brought the Japanese economy have paralyzed the bank's decision-making, critics including Mr. Kuroda charge. The bank progressively lowered its policy interest rate through the 1990s, hitting zero in 1999, but was reluctant to try more unconventional policies. The governor at the time, Masaru Hayami, thought the possibility of a return to Japan's bubble economy was still all too real and argued that deflation was not entirely a bad phenomenon.
By 2001, Japan's economy was again slumping and the bank finally tried its hand at buying up assets to create new money in the economy, a policy known as quantitative easing. Even then, the bank officials continued to voice doubts over that policy's effectiveness, even exiting quantitative easing at the first signs of an uptick in the economy in 2006.
As the global economic crisis plunged Japan's economy into its worst recession in decades, the bank has again been slow to adopt an expansionary monetary policy. Until recently, the bank also refused to set a clear inflation target.
Mr. Kuroda has long been a critic of the bank's missteps. In his 2005 book, "Success and Failure in Fiscal and Monetary Policy," he denounces the bank for constantly standing behind the curve in its understanding of the economy and deflation.
"It is dead wrong to assume that once policy interest rates are at zero, nothing much else can be done," Mr. Kuroda wrote. "Fundamental responsibility for preventing deflation lies in monetary policy," he added. At parliamentary hearings, Mr. Kuroda has committed to expanding Japan's monetary base to achieve a goal of 2 percent inflation, a level not seen since the early 1990s. He said he would do "whatever it takes" to beat deflation and restore economic growth. He also suggested that he would be open to buying long-term government bonds, as well as corporate assets, to pump more funds into the economy. However, he ruled out foreign bond purchases and was cautious about lowering the floor on short-term interest rates, which are currently at 0.1 percent.
"A dream team is set to lead the regime change at the Bank of Japan," Hajime Takata, chief economist at the Mizuho Research Institute, said in a breathless note to clients, referring to Mr. Kuroda and his two deputies, Kikuo Iwata and Hiroshi Nakaso, who also were approved by Parliament on Friday. Their terms begin on Wednesday.
At first glance, Mr. Kuroda's background as a Finance Ministry bureaucrat does not paint a picture of a colorful game-changer who may push for the kind of bold action that could finally jump-start Japan's economy. Born to parents who were also government bureaucrats, Mr. Kuroda was known as a quiet student in school, and dreamed of becoming a teacher. He was often found in the library instead of sweating it out in sports like his flashier classmates, one of whom went on to become chief cabinet secretary under former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi.
"We sometimes did jump rope, low-key things like that," said Sadatomo Matsudaira, a retired former anchor for the public broadcaster, NHK, and Mr. Kuroda's classmate through middle and high school in Tokyo. "He was very smart, but not one to assert leadership. He'd instead be right behind the leader," said Mr. Matsudaira, now a professor at the Kyoto University of Art and Design.
His intellect took Mr. Kuroda to Tokyo University's prestigious law department, then to the powerful Finance Ministry, and later to Oxford, where he earned a master's degree in economics. Back at the ministry, Mr. Kuroda made his mark in international tax and currency policy, both areas that thrust him into global financial negotiations.
As the ministry's top currency official from 1999 to 2003, Mr. Kuroda orchestrated trillions of yen's worth of market interventions in a bid to drive down the value of the yen. The act fended off global criticism while he pressed the United States and other trading partners to accommodate those moves.
Steering Japan's central bank could require those same skills of diplomacy, especially when Japan is accused of deliberately weakening the yen to benefit its exporters. Easing monetary policy further, as Mr. Kuroda is expected to do, could lead to an even weaker yen, sparking fresh complaints.
A bigger challenge, some experts say, is how much he can work effectively with the Bank of Japan rank and file, who conduct the bank's daily market operations, and with members of the bank's policy-setting board. Many within the bank still harbor longstanding reservations against aggressive easing, which the departing governor, Masaaki Shirakawa, favored.
The bank's policies have been blamed unfairly for Japan's economic woes, they say; deflation is not a product of policy missteps but reflect wider changes like an aging and shrinking population and deepening integration of Japan's economy with its Asian neighbors, where manufacturing is less expensive. And it is the government, these officials say, that must do more for economic growth and innovation.
Mr. Kuroda, in his 2005 book, answers that it does not matter why deflation occurs; it should still be the central bank's mission to fight it.
"You have to remember that the B.O.J. is a massive organization. You could say, 'March left!' but that doesn't mean everyone will march your direction," said Eiji Sakakibara, Mr. Kuroda's mentor at the Finance Ministry, the same official who puzzled over Mr. Kuroda's penchant for Greek philosophy. "He will first need to challenge very deep-rooted views at the bank, and that will not be easy."
Mr. Kuroda already appeared to face opposition from the bank's top ranks earlier this week after a board member, Koji Ishida, was quoted in media reports as saying the next governor should not take unorthodox steps too hastily.
Any big shift in the bank's policy framework would first require "a comprehensive examination of the purpose, means, costs and effects as well as the transmission channel of monetary policy," Mr. Ishida was quoted by Bloomberg as saying after a meeting with business leaders.
The inflationary push policy has its own critics. Some warn that inflation will cause a dangerous spike in interest rates on the country's already high government debt. Others simply say the Japanese economy is simply too broken to grow.
"Saying Japan needs fiscal-monetary stimulus is like saying a car needs gasoline. You can fill the tank to overflowing, but if the engine remains broken, no one is going anywhere," Richard Katz, an economic writer, opined in The International Economy magazine.
In an 1989 essay in the same magazine, Mr. Kuroda seemed resigned to the realities of policy making in an imperfect world. In the essay, he waxed lyrical about what another Greek sage, Socrates, would have made of currency management.
Such a task, Mr. Kuroda quotes his philosopher as saying, "is a beast that can only live in the gray zone between success and failure, uncertainty and hope."

Full text:   WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- The number of Americans who filed new claims for unemployment benefits dropped last week for a third consecutive week. The figure came in below the expectations of analysts and was the latest indication that the labor market recovery was gaining traction.
Other data on Thursday showed that an increase in the cost of gasoline last month pushed up producer prices, but a lack of broad price pressures gives the Federal Reserve scope to maintain its easy monetary policy.
The report on jobless claims added to a range of data -- in areas like retail sales, manufacturing and employment -- that suggested higher taxes were having a limited impact on the economy.
"The recent labor market data signal at least steady, and potentially improving, job growth so far in 2013 despite the implementation of various forms of fiscal tightening," said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan Chase.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 332,000 last week, the Labor Department said.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected first-time applications to rise to 350,000.
The four-week moving average for new claims, a better measure of trends in the labor market, fell to a five-year low.
While the signs of strength in the jobs market could intensify an already lively debate at the Fed on the future course of monetary policy, economists said the central bank was unlikely to scale back its monetary stimulus.
The Fed's policy makers meet next week to assess the economy and are widely expected to keep buying $85 billion in Treasury and mortgage-backed securities a month in an effort to spur even stronger economic growth. They have said the Fed would keep buying bonds until there was a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market.
A second report from the Labor Department offered little reason to worry about an uptick in inflation, with wholesale food prices almost reversing January's increase and the cost of automobiles rising only marginally.
But gasoline prices jumped 7.2 percent last month, enough to push the Producer Price Index up a relatively steep 0.7 percent after a 0.2 percent advance in January. In the 12 months through February, the index -- prices received by farms, factories and refineries -- rose 1.7 percent, the fastest rise since October and up from a 1.4 percent gain the prior month.
Underlying inflation pressures remained contained, however, with wholesale prices excluding volatile food and energy costs rising 0.2 percent after a similar increase in January. In the 12 months through February, this so-called core producer price index was up 1.7 percent, the smallest rise since January 2011.
Separately, the United States current account deficit narrowed in the fourth quarter, aided by an increase in services exports and more income earned abroad, the Commerce Department reported Thursday. It said the current account deficit, which measures the flow of goods, services and investments into and out of the country, fell to $110.4 billion, from an upwardly revised $112.4 billion in the third quarter.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected the fourth-quarter current account deficit to widen to $112.8 billion from a previously reported $107.5 billion for the third quarter.

Full text:   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans spent at the fastest pace in five months in February, pushing up retail sales by 1.1 percent from January. About half the increase reflected higher gasoline prices, but even excluding fuel purchases, retail sales rose 0.6 percent.
The report from the Commerce Department on Wednesday showed that Americans kept spending last month despite higher Social Security taxes that took effect this year.
Core retail sales, which exclude the volatile categories of purchases of gasoline, autos and building supplies, rose 0.4 percent in February compared with January.
Economists were encouraged by the stronger-than-expected gain in retail sales. Some said the increase means the economy may be growing faster in the January-March quarter than they had forecast.
"This all suggests that the hit to spending from the payroll tax cut and higher gasoline prices, which reduce the amount of cash available to spend on other items, hasn't been too bad," said Paul Dales, senior United States economist at Capital Economics. "The recent pickup in both employment and earnings growth bodes well for consumption growth later in the year, too."
Auto sales rose 1.1 percent after a 0.4 percent January increase. The February gain was the biggest since December. Sales at gas stations surged 5 percent, the biggest advance since a 6 percent rise in August.
Sales at general merchandise stores, a category that includes major department stores such as Macy's and big discount stores such as Walmart and Target, rose 0.5 percent in February. But the department store category as a whole fell 1 percent.
The solid increase in retail sales showed that Americans kept spending despite a payroll tax increase that has lowered take-home pay this year for most workers. A person earning $50,000 has about $1,000 less to spend in 2013. A household with two high-paid workers has up to $4,500 less.
The economy grew at a rate of only 0.1 percent in the fourth quarter, but many analysts believe the American economy will grow a modest 2 percent this year.
In a separate report, the Commerce Department said businesses increased their inventories by 1 percent in January from December, an encouraging signal that they expect consumers will spend more this year. That increase is up from 0.3 percent growth in December and the biggest gain since May 2011.
Total business sales fell 0.3 percent in January after a slight 0.1 percent rise in December.
Retail inventories increased 1.5 percent. Wholesale inventories grew 1.2 percent, the biggest gain in 13 months. Inventories held by manufacturers rose 0.5 percent.
Finally, the Labor Department reported Wednesday that import prices rose 1.1 percent in February after a 0.6 percent gain the previous month. Fuel imports jumped 4.9 percent. Excluding fuel, import prices were flat.
Low import costs have helped hold down inflation in the United States. Even with the last two months of increases in oil costs, import prices have fallen 0.3 percent in the 12 months ending in February.
Export prices rose 0.8 percent in February from January, pushed up by higher prices for agricultural goods. In the past year, export prices have increased 1.5 percent, led by a 13.4 percent jump in farm goods.

Full text:   MOSCOW -- Asserting further personal control over the Russian economy, President Vladimir V. Putin nominated on Tuesday a close political ally, who is now serving as his chief economic adviser, to become the new chief of the Russian central bank.
The nomination of Elvira Nabiullina signals strongly that the bank will lower rates in the months ahead, something Mr. Putin has been pressing for against the advice of the bank's current leadership.
Worryingly for investors, Mr. Putin nominated a confidante despite a consensus among global economic policy planners that countries with independent central bankers tend to do better economically over the long term. Yet Mr. Putin already controls other ostensibly independent institutions in Russia, like Parliament.
Mr. Putin's government has also advocated for more seats on the bank's board and plans to combine the functions of the stock market regulator, the equivalent of the Securities and Exchange Commission, with the central bank, further centralizing financial regulatory control.
"The central bank isn't simply a commercial bank, it is above all the regulator of our financial system and the most powerful institution responsible for state economic policy," Mr. Putin said in making the announcement, in comments carried by news agencies.
Supporters of a more independent institution had hoped a deputy central bank chairman, Aleksei Ulyukayev, might take over as a candidate representing continuity and independence.
Mr. Ulyukayev in January had taken the unusual step for a Russian state official of defying obvious demands from the Kremlin. It wanted lower interest rates; Mr. Ulyukayev argued that such a move risked further stoking inflation, now at 7.3 percent.
But members of Mr. Putin's economic team, including Ms. Nabiullina, have been openly pushing for lower rates that might stimulate faster growth closer to the 8 percent or so common during Mr. Putin's first two terms.
Still, speaking at his country residence, Novo-Ogaryovo, Mr. Putin suggested on Tuesday some compromise with supporters of the current bank leadership by announcing that Sergey M. Ignatiev, the current central bank chairman, would remain as an adviser to Ms. Nabiullina.
Investors are likely to react negatively to the appointment, which was announced after the close of the market Tuesday in Moscow, said Ivan Tchakarov, the chief economist for Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States, at Renaissance, a Moscow investment bank.
"She is often seen as a close political ally of Putin," Mr. Tchakarov said of Ms. Nabiullina. "This will certainly be perceived by markets as a signal that the central bank of Russia in the future will be much more subject to pressure. This is a blow to the independence of the central bank."
Mr. Tchakarov said the appointment was a signal of higher inflation and a weaker ruble to come.
That is what the government has wanted. In February, Dmitry A. Medvedev, Russia's prime minister, released an economic policy statement calling for 5 percent annual growth, up from 3.5 percent last year. At the same meeting, Mr. Putin obliquely blamed the central bank, formally known as the Bank of Russia, saying current bank rates were not conducive to growth. That seemed to seal Mr. Ulyukayev's fate.
While a policy of lower rates might work to boost economic growth in large, stable economies like the United States or European countries with so-called safe haven currencies, the calculus is different in Russia, where lower interest rates risk turning away currency traders, who will dump the high-risk ruble if returns drop.
This occurred in Belarus, Russia's neighbor, during a balance of payments crisis two years ago when the Belarussian currency, also called the ruble, collapsed.
Still, Belarus's central bank on Tuesday cut its main interest rate below 30 percent, against the advice of the International Monetary Fund. That cut, to 28.5 percent, was seen as a sign of a loss of central bank independence. In Belarus, the country's authoritarian president, Aleksandr Lukashenko, had flatly threatened to fire the central bank leadership if they did not lower rates.
Hungary's prime minister, Viktor Orban, recently made a similar move, naming his economics minister and ally, Gyorgy Matolcsy, to head the central bank.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Senate Democrats and House Republicans on Tuesday outlined vastly divergent approaches to shoring up the government's finances, a reminder of how far apart they remain on fiscal policy even as both sides insist publicly that a bipartisan compromise is possible.
As part of the effort to find common ground, President Obama made a rare appearance at a gathering of Democratic senators -- his first of four meetings with lawmakers on Capitol Hill this week -- to explore ways that the two parties could overcome differences that have deadlocked the budget process for much of the last five years.
But in many ways, the two parties seemed to be working in parallel universes.
House Republicans, led by Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, presented a tax and spending plan that relies on many of the same policies that became lightning rods for critics during the 2012 presidential campaign, when Mr. Ryan was the party's vice-presidential nominee. At the White House, a senior administration official said that the Republican budget demonstrated how complicated negotiations would be.
The Republican plan sets out to balance the budget in a decade and would cut spending by $4.6 trillion through 2023, in large part by rolling back many of Mr. Obama's signature legislative accomplishments. It would repeal the health care overhaul of 2009, eliminate the subsidized insurance exchanges and Medicaid expansion that make up the core of the law, and turn Medicare into a system of private insurance plans financed by federal vouchers.
Republicans would also do away with Wall Street regulatory laws that Mr. Obama championed and cancel the financing his administration sought for a high-speed rail network.
Senate Democrats, meanwhile, were pressing forward with a budget they planned to start moving through the committee process on Wednesday. Before they could proceed, they had to set aside differences among themselves over how much to change costly but cherished federal benefit programs. When Mr. Obama met with them on Tuesday, several voiced concerns about cuts to Social Security and Medicare.
The Democrats' budget plan will not call for adjusting the way inflation is calculated as a way to lower the future cost of those benefits, though Mr. Obama has said such a change should be on the table in talks with Republicans.
In stark contrast to the austerity measures and dismantling of top Obama administration priorities that are at the center of the Republican plan, the Democrats' budget would create new government initiatives, expand others and seek to generate more tax revenue.
Their proposal calls for a new $100 billion economic stimulus initiative for job training and repair to roads and bridges, projects that Democrats say they would pay for by closing loopholes in the tax code that benefit large corporations and wealthy individuals. All told, Democrats believe they can save nearly $1 trillion through such tax changes.
They would save an additional $1 trillion by trimming spending, with a quarter of those cuts coming from the Pentagon.
But as lawmakers on Tuesday began their budget deliberations for the fiscal year that starts Oct. 1, a stopgap measure to finance the government until then ran into trouble in the Senate as Tom Coburn of Oklahoma and John McCain of Arizona, both Republicans, raised objections, saying it included wasteful pork-barrel spending.
Democrats immediately seized on Mr. Ryan's budget as a sign that the Republican Party had failed to heed the lessons of the 2012 elections, which denied Mr. Ryan and Mitt Romney the presidency and cut the Republican ranks in both houses of Congress.
Senior administration officials said the Ryan budget underscored the hurdles the White House would confront if it hoped to reach an overarching budget deal with House Republicans. If Republicans demonstrate that absolutism in negotiations, a senior official said, there is no chance for an agreement.
"This budget reflects the same skewed priorities the Republican Party has championed for years -- the same skewed priorities Americans rejected in November," Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader, said in remarks on the Senate floor on Tuesday. "We've seen this show before."
But Mr. Ryan said the election results would not intimidate Republicans into backing down.
"The election didn't go our way -- believe me I, I know what that feels like," Mr. Ryan said at a news conference during which he was asked repeatedly why his party was doubling down on proposals that the American people appeared to have rejected in November.
"That means we surrender our principles? That means we stop believing in what we believe in?" he said, continuing: "We think we owe the country a balanced budget. We think we owe the country solutions to the big problems that are plaguing our nation: a debt crisis on the horizon, a slow-growing economy, people trapped in poverty. We're showing our answers."
Republicans said their plan would balance the budget in 10 years, a contention the White House said was impossible given that it would cut the top marginal income tax rate, which the wealthiest Americans pay, to 25 percent from 39.6 percent, depriving the government of considerable tax revenue.
During the presidential campaign, Mr. Romney promised to cut the top income tax rate by seven percentage points, a $5 trillion hole in the government's financing that Mr. Obama mocked as mathematically impossible to fill. Mr. Ryan's plan would lower the top rate by 14.6 percentage points but keep the government's finances unchanged, it says, with closings of tax loopholes he has declined to detail.
Mr. Ryan said in his plan that the deficit would fall to $528 billion in the 2014 fiscal year, down modestly from the $616 billion deficit forecast last month by the Congressional Budget Office.
From there, the deficit's drop would be steeper; the plan projects it to be $125 billion in 2015 and $69 billion in 2016, with a $7 billion surplus in 2023.
Medicaid would be cut by an additional $756 billion, by turning it into block grants to the states and limiting growth. Other so-called mandatory programs -- not subject to Congress's annual discretion -- would be cut by $962 billion. States would be allowed to put time and access limits on food stamps, for instance, and agricultural subsidies would be cut by $31 billion.
Discretionary programs, already squeezed by caps imposed in 2011 and automatic across-the-board cuts that went into force this month, would be cut by an additional $249 billion. Pell grants, a popular federal aid program for higher education, would be capped at the current level of $5,645 for 10 years. And federal education and job training programs would be consolidated.
Neither party's budget will become law. They are merely statements of policy priorities. But they will form the basis for any negotiations to reach what lawmakers hope will be a broader compromise on fiscal and economic issues that will end the cycle of passing stopgap budgets.
