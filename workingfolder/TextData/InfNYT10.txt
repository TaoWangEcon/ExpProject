Full text: The Restaurant Week gambit is so old that it has been co-opted by cities across the country and abroad and even by New York City boroughs and neighborhoods. But the prospect of a discounted gourmet meal still tickles the taste buds of savvy foodies like Radha Day. Ms. Day was a teenager living in Italy when business leaders in New York cooked up the inaugural Restaurant Week in the summer of 1992. But since she arrived here a decade ago, she has faithfully sampled prix fixe menus in aspirational dining rooms around the city.
She can describe with relish each course of the first Restaurant Week lunch she enjoyed in 2007 and already knows where she will partake when this year's edition of the expanded promotion begins this month. The 390 participating restaurants officially begin taking reservations Monday morning, but Ms. Day and her colleagues at the United Nations got a head start.
The table they have their sights set on is at Riverpark, an East Side creation of celebrity chef Tom Colicchio that has posted its Restaurant Week offerings. So, Ms. Day already has her palate primed for the octopus carpaccio appetizer and the zucca filled with patty pan squash.
"My dad has this saying: 'I live for the 12 centimeters of tongue in my mouth,"' Ms. Day said, explaining the origin of her love of food.
During past Restaurant Weeks -- the program now spans four weeks in midsummer and three weeks of the winter -- Ms. Day's adventurous appetite has led her deep into the East Village for Austrian cuisine and to Aquavit to sample the Scandinavian fare of chef Marcus Samuelsson.
"For sure, there was herring involved," Ms. Day said, when pressed on what she ate at Aquavit several years ago. She recalled prodding a Singaporean colleague who balked at the herring by saying, "Come on, you guys eat weirder stuff than that."
Enticing New Yorkers and tourists to patronize establishments during slack periods is the aim of Restaurant Week, said Tracy Nieporent, the chairman of the restaurant committee of NYC & Company, the city's tourism marketing agency. This summer's promotion will run from July 24 through Aug. 18.
"The reason we do it is it always generates a good volume of business when times are a little slower," said Mr. Nieporent, who is the director of marketing for the company that operates Tribeca Grill and five other restaurants.
But that benefit was not envisioned a quarter-century ago when Tribeca Grill and 93 other restaurants signed on for the first iteration of Restaurant Week. The program was conceived as a favor to the delegates and media representatives who came to town for the Democratic National Convention in July 1992.
Charged with finding ways of entertaining the visitors, Tim Zagat and Joseph Baum persuaded restaurateurs to draw up bargain lunch menus that they expected would be money-losers. The original price of $19.92 for a three-course meal at such celebrated places as Tavern on the Green and Windows on the World drew an overwhelming response.
Accounts from that year -- long before Open Table or text messages existed -- describe phones ringing off hooks from morning until night. "Nobody had ever had this choice of restaurants," Mr. Zagat recalled in an interview last week.
Though out-of-towners were the intended targets, the offer appealed to local residents who considered culinary temples like Montrachet and Le Cirque to be beyond their reach, Mr. Zagat said. "When you told them that would cost only $19.92, they said, 'I can afford that,"' he said.
Restaurant owners were pleasantly surprised when the promotion turned out to be a boon for business, Mr. Zagat said. "We thought we were asking them to make a charitable contribution to the city at a time when we had a lot of reporters here," he said, recalling that some expensive French restaurants begged off because they couldn't afford to accept so little.
"But almost immediately after we did it just about everybody said, 'Gee, this was good. We thought we were going to be losing a lot of money this week,"' Mr. Zagat recounted.
Restaurants now plead to be included, even though the cost of admission to Restaurant Week has not kept pace with inflation. The price is holding steady this year at $29 for lunch and $42 for dinner.
This year's participants cover all five boroughs and 34 cuisines, said Fred Dixon, the chief executive of NYC & Company. He cited data from Open Table, which calculated that Restaurant Week reservations made online since 2007 had generated $108 million in spending.
"Dining is such an integral part of a New York City visit," Mr. Dixon said. "It's part and parcel of visiting New York and living in New York."
Over the years, the Restaurant Week concept has become as ubiquitous as beet and goat cheese salad. Los Angeles cast it as Dine LA. Indianapolis has Devour Indy. Toronto stages Summerlicious and Winterlicious. It has spawned imitations even within New York City. Brooklyn held Dine In Brooklyn in March. The Sunnyside section of Queens held the fourth annual Sunnyside Restaurant Week in September.
Mr. Nieporent said NYC & Company should be able to keep Restaurant Week going "for a long time like a hit show." He said he had not seen any indication of a loss of momentum, joking, "Someday we'll do Restaurant Year and take a few weeks off for good behavior."
Tribeca Grill Was One of 94 Restaurants That Signed On for the First Restaurant Week, in July 1992.; "the Reason We Do It Is It Always Generates a Good Volume of Business When Times Are a Little Slower," Said Tracy Nieporent, Director of Marketing for the Company That Operates Tribeca Grill, at Left and Below, and Five Other Restaurants.

Full text: Over the last few months, incoming numbers on the job market made it seem that the United States was closing in on full employment -- the state where very nearly everyone who wants a job has one, and efforts to boost the economy further just create inflation. The June numbers released Friday are a big "not so fast" moment for that theory.
In their particulars, the latest numbers are more consistent with an economy that has some room to run. This economic expansion, now eight years old, may have some life in it yet.
If the economy were at full employment, we would expect the rate at which employers were adding jobs to slow down. You can't add workers to your payrolls if there are no workers to take those jobs. And as recently as a month ago it appeared that job growth was slowing down -- not in an alarming way, but in the way you might expect in a job market that was becoming tight.
Never mind. In June, the nation added 222,000 jobs, and previous months' job growth numbers were revised up by a combined 47,000. That was enough to push the average monthly job gains for the first half of 2017 to 180,000, basically the same as the 187,000 average in 2016. It had seemed that job growth was decelerating this year, but that no longer appears so (or at least, if it is so, we'll need a few more months of data to prove it).
Part of the reason this strong job growth is taking place despite a low unemployment rate is that there were, in June at least, more people coming into the labor force. One of the most disappointing results in the May numbers was a sharp drop in the number of people in the labor force, but it looks to have been a statistical aberration, almost completely reversing itself in June.
With the unemployment rate relatively low -- 4.4 percent in June -- future growth in employment will need to come not from people who are actively looking for a job today, but from pulling people into the job market who currently aren't working or looking for work at all.
The overall trend in 2017 isn't great on that front. The civilian labor force has increased by only 84,000 people a month on average, down from 140,000 in 2016. But the June numbers are at least some assurance that things aren't as bad as the May numbers suggested and that there continue to be potential workers out there who might join the labor force with an economy that truly hums.
Which brings us to a third area in which the data point to some room for further improvement in the jobs picture. Wage growth showed no sign of improvement in June; average hourly earnings rose 0.2 percent and are up 2.5 percent over the last year. Those numbers aren't horrendous given low inflation, and aren't shocking given low growth in labor productivity. But they hardly point to an environment where employers are so desperate for workers that they are, in the aggregate, getting into bidding wars for their talents.
Indeed, the 2.5 percent annual growth in hourly earnings is consistent with the pattern in place for years now. It is neither an acceleration nor a deceleration. In any market, you expect that when something is getting scarce, its price will rise more quickly. The fact that wages -- the price of labor -- are not rising more quickly is a good hint that labor is not as scarce as the 4.4 percent unemployment rate might suggest.
And while unemployment rose (from 4.3 percent) for good reasons in June -- people entering the labor force -- the simple fact that not all of those new entrants were immediately snapped up by employers is a hint that there may be some slack remaining in the job market. The broader measure of unemployment known as U-6 rose even more, reversing a drop in May and rising to 8.6 percent from 8.4 percent.
Job creation is more robust than it had seemed, while wage growth is soft and the labor force is growing. It would be a mistake to make too much of one month's numbers, but for now the numbers support optimism that the labor market has room to get better -- with higher wages for more workers -- before it gets worse.

Payrolls Expand, Even as Pay Lags

Full text: Automobile sales may be slowing, e-commerce is putting the squeeze on bricks-and-mortar stores, and overall economic growth is limp. But the labor market has nevertheless managed to charge ahead. Employers added an impressive 222,000 jobs in June, the government reported on Friday. Although the jobless rate ticked up slightly to 4.4 percent, it was because some people who had dropped out of the labor force were lured back.
But the hunger for workers and mounting complaints of labor shortages have raised a vexing question: Why isn't the heightened demand for workers driving up pay?
The Federal Reserve pointed to that conundrum in the updated report on the American economy it sent to Congress on Friday. "Despite the broad-based strength in measures of employment," it said, "wage growth has been only modest, possibly held down by the weak pace of productivity growth in recent years."
The Fed's report reflected its overall confidence in the country's economic direction, which has led it to begin raising interest rates for businesses and consumers after years of holding them near zero to encourage investment and risk-taking. After increasing its benchmark rate last month, the Fed is expected to do so at least once more before the year's end.
One of its aims is to head off any inflation that might result from a tight job market that prompts employers to offer higher pay to get the workers they need. Yet prices have been rising at a slow pace, and sluggish wage growth suggests that the fear may be premature.
"The payroll number is well above expectations," said Jim O'Sullivan, chief United States economist for High Frequency Economics. "It's pretty clear that the trend in employment growth is strong enough to keep the unemployment rate trending down." Revisions to earlier estimates brought the monthly average gain since April to 194,000. But year-over-year wage growth plodded along at 2.5 percent.
"The wage numbers are certainly weaker than expected," Mr. O'Sullivan said, "so it keeps alive the whole debate about the relationship between slack and inflation, and how far the Federal Reserve should allow the unemployment rate to fall."
June was the eighth anniversary of the end of the recession, when the economy hit bottom, with employers shedding hundreds of thousands of workers and the jobless rate more than double what it is today. But many workers have yet to fully benefit from the expansion.
"This is not a market we have typically seen," said Michael Stull, senior vice president at the staffing company Manpower North America. "We have not before seen unemployment drop, low participation rates and wages not move. That tells you something's not right in the labor market."
Employers are very aware that the pool of workers is shrinking and they are rethinking traditional qualifications like length of experience, Mr. Stull said.
"Employers will take on hard-working, reliable workers even if they don't have an opening," he said.
At the same time, he said that workers were "pushing back a little bit about driving an hour for a $10-an-hour job at a distribution center on the outer rim of the city."
"You need a car for that," Mr. Stull said, "and you can't have a car on $10 an hour."
That's a familiar problem to Tom Thompson, owner of Star Cleaning Systems in Columbus, Ohio. He is looking to add two or three part-time workers to his 20-member staff.
"Very few people show up for interviews, and if they do, they don't show up for the job," Mr. Thompson said. "I'm spending 80 to 90 percent of my time recruiting. I triple-book appointments for interviews, and I'm lucky if I get one person to show up."
He is offering $9.25 an hour to start, with bonuses and increases for workers who stick around. Running a new company, he said, he cannot afford to pay significantly more.
Nearby distribution centers for big companies like Amazon are sucking up most of the available labor, Mr. Thompson said. "I sometimes wish there was actually a higher unemployment rate," he said.
Like Star Cleaning, Rooforia Home Exteriors in Omaha often finds customers through Thumbtack, an online marketplace for hiring people to complete tasks. These days it is the workers who are tougher to find.
"We did everything we could to recruit people and had not one application," said Rooforia's owner, Sarah M. Smith.
She is depending on guest-worker visas to fill openings for the season, which runs from the spring through November. "It's hard work in Nebraska," Ms. Smith said. "We have hot summers, and you're on a black asphalt roof."
At $17 an hour, she said, "the pay is fair."
"We get a lot of people saying the visa program is taking jobs away from Americans," Ms. Smith said, "but in reality, they're not taking the jobs because there is no one even willing to do the jobs."
"We had one person we recruited," she said. "He didn't even show up the next day."
Patrick Bass, chief executive of Thyssenkrupp North America, part of a German multinational conglomerate, said his company was increasingly relying on methods common in Germany like apprenticeships, partnerships with colleges, and internships.
"We're willing to invest in the people and bring them in and train them," Mr. Bass said. "But for the basic-skill job, we're seeing a higher turnover rate than normal. People are job shopping a bit, because they can. They're trying different things to see what they like."
While the government's statistics offer a bird's-eye perspective, hiring is essentially local. "Even in an era of low national unemployment, with recent jobs reports showing the national unemployment rate ticking down close to 4 percent, jobs are not always available and not everyone who wants work can find it," Martha Ross, a fellow at the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution, noted in her blog. "There is no one-size-fits-all approach to help people prepare for and find jobs."
Professional services showed a healthy gain in jobs last month, possibly reflecting the hiring of new college graduates. Other sectors that showed substantial gains included health care, social assistance and food services.
Reviews of the economy tend to reflect political affiliations, with Republicans more optimistic since the election than Democrats. Ideology aside, however, uncertainty about federal policy may be weighing on the economy. Businesses reported a burst of optimism after President Trump's election, in part because of expectations that the new administration would enact fiscal measures like tax cuts. But that buoyant outlook is fading.
"This cautious approach to investment may in part reflect uncertainty about the policy environment," Stanley Fischer, the Fed's vice chairman, told an audience in Vineyard Haven, Mass., on Thursday. "Providing more clarity on the future direction of government policy is highly desirable."
Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said in a statement,"This new report shows positive gains: Job creation came in higher than expected and the labor force grew," but he added, "We have a lot more work to do."
Much of Mr. Trump's pro-business agenda remains stalled in Congress. Although Republicans control the White House and both legislative chambers, they have so far been unable to agree on a final budget, a new health care plan, a tax overhaul or an infrastructure program.
"This is an unprecedented level of political uncertainty," said William E. Spriggs, chief economist for the A.F.L.-C.I.O. "That is creating a drag on the economy."
Juanita Duggan, chief executive of the National Federation of Independent Businesses, said, "Small-business owners seem to be in a holding pattern while they wait to see what Congress will do with taxes and health care."

Full text: If the halting, messy debate over legislation to overhaul health care has taught us anything so far, it's that when it comes to health care, Republicans don't know what they want, much less how to get it. After years of campaigning on the promise of repealing the Affordable Care Act, when it finally came time to act, Republicans put together a plan that looks like a stingier, skimpier version of Obamacare in the individual market, plus a rollback of the law's Medicaid expansion (delayed until after the next presidential election -- long enough that it might not happen).
When asked about the status of the health care bill this week, Senator Pat Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, responded, "I didn't expect Donald Trump to win, I think most of my colleagues didn't, so we didn't expect to be in this situation." In short, Republicans didn't plan on having to follow through on their promises.
Democrats, on the other hand, share a distinct vision of robust universal coverage guaranteed by the government and paid for by a combination of delivery-system efficiencies and higher taxes.
What Republicans need, then, is a set of guiding principles -- a health care vision that should work from the ground up, that imagines a more affordable and more effective system, one that's fairer and more focused.
For starters, it would mean giving up on comprehensive universal coverage. Otherwise, Republicans will just end up bargaining on the terms set by Democrats, as they are now.
One might reasonably object that Republicans have already given up on that goal, based on their own plans, which would disrupt coverage for millions in the first year alone and result in far fewer people insured in the long run.
The problem for Republicans is that they have not yet backed away from universal coverage rhetorically. Senior Republicans still criticize Obamacare for covering too few people. This disconnect between what Republicans say and what they are willing to do has kept the party from moving in more productive directions.
Which brings us to a second principle: unification, not fragmentation.
For decades, the health care system has been broken into several distinct layers: Medicare, Medicaid and employer-provided coverage. The first two are paid for directly by the government. The third is subsidized implicitly through the tax code, which does not tax health benefits provided by employers as income.
This tax break is the original sin of the United States health care system. Worth more than $250 billion annually, it has enormously distorted the market, creating an incentive for employers to provide ever-more-generous insurance while insulating individuals from the true cost of care. It discourages job switching and entrepreneurship, and offers an unfair advantage to the comfortably employed.
Medicare, meanwhile, offers a huge system of federal benefits to older Americans that typically run far beyond what most have paid in. Its introduction was associated with explosive growth in hospital-costs inflation during the 1970s.
Rather than overhauling this fragmented system, both Obamacare and the Senate bill leave its distortions largely in place. Obamacare nibbled at its edges by paring back Medicare to finance new coverage and by applying a tax to high-cost health insurance plans provided by employers. But President Barack Obama delayed that tax until 2020; the Senate legislation would delay it until 2026, suggesting it may never take effect at all.
The result is an unequal system in which health insurance is understood more as a way of prepaying for medical care than as a protection from financial risk.
That's where the third principle comes in: Health coverage is not the same as health care. Instead, it is a financial product, a backstop against financial ruin. Health care policy should treat it as one. There is some question about how much programs like Medicaid contribute to measurable physical health outcomes, but there is no arguing that it effectively insulates beneficiaries from financial shocks.
Health care policy that treated insurance as a hedge against financial shock could relieve one of the most salient worries of the middle class -- that chance might curse them with unaffordably high medical expenses.
For noncatastrophic, nonemergency medical expenses, Republicans ought to promote affordability rather than subsidies. All layers of the nation's health care system are subsidized either directly or implicitly, and the subsidies shield individuals from the costs of their decisions and create incentives for providers to deliver more care rather than better care. Republicans should look for ways to limit cost increases directly.
One way to do this is to encourage supply-side innovations in addition to demand-side reforms. The tangle of regulations governing health care can make it difficult for providers to respond to market signals and innovate. Doctor-owned hospitals are restricted by law, for example, and certificate-of-need requirements force medical providers to obtain licenses in a process that effectively requires them to ask permission from competitors to expand.
Finally, Republicans should always focus government assistance on the poorest and sickest: This should be obvious, and yet it is not. Our system subsidizes workers with six-figure salaries and wealthy retirees while sidelining the poor and the sick in Medicaid, a system that many doctors won't participate in because of low reimbursement rates.
No one starting from scratch would design a system that looks like this. And while starting from scratch is not possible, that is, in essence, what a Republican vision should seek to do.
This might mean reforming Medicaid, or creating a program with a similar goal of aiding the poor and the sick, but also seeking to make it more effective for those it covers. It might mean widely expanding health savings accounts or a broader system of catastrophic health insurance. It might mean seeking to limit the price-distorting power of hospital monopolies. It would almost certainly mean substantial reforms to both Medicare and the tax treatment of employer-sponsored health insurance. Hopefully, it would mean pursuing ideas that no one has thought of yet.
Republicans should have no illusions: Selling this vision would take a significant investment of time, creativity and study, policy entrepreneurship and some difficult political and legislative choices. It would require patience and political salesmanship. And it would not result in an immediately popular bill that could easily pass in the Senate with 51 Republican votes this summer. In the short term, it would mean retreat.
But over time it would distinguish Republicans from their Democratic rivals and give them a positive, productive policy pitch to run on, while giving voters better choices for health care.
It would also, not incidentally, have the advantage of improving the nation's health care system.

Full text: Working hard and getting ahead used to go hand in hand. But that was a long time ago, before decades of stagnating incomes and rising inequality took their toll. A study published recently by the National Bureau of Economic Research provides an unvarnished look at the damage. The researchers, from the University of Minnesota, the University of Chicago, Princeton University and the Social Security Administration, analyzed the lifetime income histories of millions of workers who started working from 1957 to 1983 and the partial histories of those who entered the work force after that. The research thus measures not only annual ups and downs or average gains and losses, but also longer-term economic mobility.
The findings are a stark reminder that the twin scourges of poor wage growth and income inequality, left unaddressed, will only worsen.
Men have been harder hit than women, partly because they had more to lose. Lifetime income rose modestly for the typical man who entered the labor force from 1957 to 1966. But then it began to decline. In all, the median lifetime income for men who began working in 1983 was lower than for men who started in 1967, by 10 percent to 19 percent, depending on the inflation measure used.
That works out to a total lifetime income loss of $96,100 to $243,350 -- even after accounting for the rise in the value of nonwage benefits. The decline was mainly a result of lower pay after adjusting for inflation, and not from reductions in weekly hours or years in the work force. Over the same period, the median lifetime income of women increased by 22 percent to 33 percent, as more women spent more hours and years in the labor force. But the gains, from a very low starting point, were smaller than men's losses and were not enough to eliminate the historic gap in hourly pay between men and women.
Will lifetime income continue to lag? The answer, unfortunately, appears to be yes. The researchers found that declining lifetime income among men after 1967 was almost entirely attributable to lower incomes at younger ages, without any offsetting increases at later ages. Similarly, among women, the gains in lifetime income had slowed over time, in large part because of slowing growth after age 45. Since today's workers face those same trends, the same downward trend in lifetime income is likely.
As workers lose ground, inequality deepens, because money that would flow to wages tends to flow instead to those at the top of the income ladder. Indeed, the researchers found that incomes of younger workers entering the labor market are more unequal than in the past, suggesting that inequality in lifetime incomes will persist and even worsen.
The study shows that stagnating wages and rising inequality are deeply entrenched. There is no cure-all, but there are policy remedies. Updated overtime pay standards would raise pay broadly in the service sector, as would closing the gender pay gap, through better disclosure of corporate pay scales, anti-discrimination legislation and litigation. Exposure of the differences between the pay of executives and the pay of workers would shed light on some unjustifiable gaps, and call into question tactics like share buybacks that reward shareholders even as workers are shortchanged.
Reasonable people can disagree on how to approach the problem. But no one can deny that a problem exists and that it demands a response.

Full text: CORRECTION APPENDED. Republican lawmakers have their own version of the facts about the impact of their replacement for the Affordable Care Act. Here is an assessment.
Senator Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania said falsely that the bill "does not pull the rug from anyone currently covered by Obamacare, and keeps the Medicaid expansion."
A reader asked The New York Times to examine Mr. Toomey's claims specifically as they related to Pennsylvania, where more than 700,000 people gained insurance through the Medicaid expansion and 360,000 through the exchanges set up by the Affordable Care Act.
While the Senate bill does not revoke expanded Medicaid eligibility, it does gradually reduce the federal government's contributions, while also capping future funding on a per-enrollee basis. The bill's changes to premium tax credits and its elimination of cost-sharing subsidies would affect all age groups, but especially older Americans.
This would lead to 15 million fewer Medicaid enrollees and seven million fewer in the individual market within the next decade, the Congressional Budget Office estimated.
According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan health research group, Pennsylvanians would see a 72 percent increase in out-of-pocket premium costs under the new bill, compared with a national average increase of 74 percent.
Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee argued that the bill actually "increases Medicaid funding" at the rate of inflation, though current funding exceeds that.
Mr. Alexander's carefully worded statement is technically accurate, but leaves a misleading impression.
The bill places a limit on the federal government's share of Medicaid spending for different groups at different times. In 2020, it pegs funding growth to the medical inflation rate for children and adults at 3.7 percent, and at 4.7 percent for disabled adults and older Americans. In 2025, growth for all groups would be tied to the Consumer Price Index.
But Medicaid spending for adults and children under the current law is expected to grow faster, at 4.9 percent per year -- a "substantial" difference in funding, the budget office said.
Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, said the bill would "reduce taxes on the middle class," but most of the benefits go to high-income earners.
The budget office estimated that the bill includes tax cuts totaling $700 billion over the next decade. People at all income levels would see some of the money, but characterizing the cuts as a boon for the middle class is misleading.
More than $230 billion comes from repealing two taxes that apply only to individuals making over $200,000 a year. The bill would also eliminate a tax on health insurers, amounting to a cut of $145 billion.
Middle-class households would see an average tax cut of $280, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. In contrast, a household in the top 0.1 percent would get a cut of $250,000. Looking at overall distribution, two-thirds of the $700 billion would line the pockets of the richest one-fifth of Americans.
The White House and President Trump used a flawed report to claim the Affordable Care Act led to premiums' doubling and tripling.
A reader asked The Times to check a graphic circulated in the White House's newsletter, Your 1600 Daily, stating that premiums "are up by 105 percent" since the A.C.A.'s enactment. Mr. Trump later bemoaned a 206 percent (actually 203 percent) increase in Alaska specifically.
The figures come from a May report from the Department of Health and Human Services that said premiums increased to $476 this year from $232 in 2013, before the health care law took full effect. According to the report, average premiums in Alaska jumped to $1,041 from $344.
As The Times explained in a fact-check of Mr. McConnell, the comparison is imperfect -- and Mr. Trump errs further by selectively choosing the second-highest increase to exaggerate the report's findings.
Mr. Trump compares two fundamentally different universes of plans: all the plans on the individual market in 2013 and those only on the federal exchange in 2017. The plans are different, with Affordable Care Act plans covering more and sicker people and offering more comprehensive benefits.
The report also does not take into account premium tax credits that most Obamacare enrollees -- 93 percent in Alaska, according to a different Health and Human Services report -- receive to help blunt the cost of premiums. Subsidies in Alaska this year averaged $976 a month, so people actually paid significantly less under the current bill than they did in 2013.
Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin suggested misleadingly that the A.C.A. "caused" a gap in Medicaid coverage.
An estimated 2.6 million people are uninsured because they live in states that did not expand Medicaid, but earn too little to qualify for premium tax credits in the Affordable Care Act markets. Blaming the health care law for the coverage gap distorts a chain of causality.
As written, the law provides subsidies for marketplace insurance for people with moderate annual incomes, from 100 to 400 percent of the poverty level (about $22,160 for a family of four). It simultaneously increases Medicaid eligibility for low-income individuals, to 138 percent of the poverty level from the previous threshold of 44 percent.
But the Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that the federal government could not compel states to expand their programs, with 19 states then declining to do so. In those states, people making 44 to 100 percent of the poverty level did not qualify for Medicaid or marketplace subsidies.
"The A.C.A. intended to provide coverage across the income spectrum," said Rachel Garfield, a Medicaid expert at the Kaiser Family Foundation. "The only reason that gap exists is because of those state decisions."

Correction: July 7, 2017, Friday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Tuesday about Republican tax-cut proposals misstated the percentage of households that would get a tax cut of $250,000. It is the top 0.1 percent, not the top 1 percent.

Confidence Has Boomed. The Economy? Not Really.

Full text: After Donald J. Trump won the presidential election, Americans' optimism about the economic future soared. But midway through the year, that optimism has not translated into concrete economic gains. This seeming contradiction exposes a reality about the role of psychology in economics -- or more specifically, how psychology is connected only loosely to actual growth. It will take more than feelings to fix the sluggishness that has been evident in the United States and other major economies for years. Confidence isn't some magic elixir for the economy: Businesses will hire and invest only when they see concrete evidence of demand for their products, and consumers intensify their spending only when their incomes justify it.
The sharp rise in economic optimism after the election came through no matter how the question was asked or who answered, whether the survey was intended to capture consumer confidence or consumer comfort or consumer sentiment. It was true in surveys of small-business owners and of C.E.O.s of some of the biggest companies in the world. And the rise during the winter months in these surveys has mostly been sustained in the months since.
But the economy is plodding along at the same modest rate it has for the last eight years nonetheless -- at least when you look at "hard" data around economic activity instead of "soft" data like surveys, as analysts put it.
President Trump said on Twitter on Sunday that the stock market was at an "all-time high" and that unemployment was at its lowest level in years, both of which are true (he added that wages would start going up, which is certainly possible).
But in overall measures of economic activity, the expansion looks much as it has for years, with steady growth of around 2 percent. The Trump economy so far looks an awful lot like the Obama economy.
For all of business executives' apparent enthusiasm, the nation is adding jobs more slowly in 2017 than it did in 2016, and investment spending by businesses is growing modestly; new orders for capital goods are up only 0.7 percent so far in 2017.
Consumers' spending was 2.7 percent higher in the first four months this year than in the same period of 2016, adjusted for inflation -- which is slower than the 3.2 percent year-over-year gain at the end of 2016.
And while the stock market has been surging and the Federal Reserve has raised short-term interest rates, long-term Treasury bond yields remain very low, suggesting that traders do not buy the idea that growth is poised to accelerate. A falling dollar suggests currency markets see improving prospects in Europe and elsewhere.
There is no sign a recession is brewing, but neither is there evidence for the kind of boom you might expect if you believe that confidence is a crucial driver of economic growth.
This is less surprising when you look at the historical record of confidence surveys.
When financial commentators talk about the economy, they often use the elusive concept of confidence as part of their narrative. It's hard to describe what is happening in the global economy, with billions of people producing trillions of dollars of goods and services. Using a vague psychological concept is a tidy way of describing why things happen when the underlying drivers are uncertain.
To say that "the economy is slowing down because people are less confident" sounds a lot better than "the economy is slowing down for a whole bunch of complex reasons that I'm not really sure about." Confidence has a kind of mystical explanatory power thanks to its vagueness.
But "confidence" isn't really some psychological pixie dust that determines the economic future. Rather, it often reflects underlying fundamentals -- whether consumers see job opportunities readily available, for example, and whether businesses are seeing strong advance orders.
"Confidence generally goes up when we see strong income growth or big gains in household wealth," said Karen Dynan, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics whose former work for the Treasury Department and Federal Reserve included forecasting consumer spending. "You'll typically see higher consumption spending after that happens. But it's caused by the rise in income and wealth, not the rise in confidence."
Sometimes these surveys can pick up on shifts in those fundamentals before they are evident in more concrete data points. But that doesn't mean that they do a fantastic job on their own of predicting the economic future.
Since 1999, there has been a fairly strong correlation between the Conference Board's consumer confidence index and the growth in personal consumption expenditures over the ensuing six months, just as you might expect. (And if the past relationship holds, spending levels will accelerate.)
But that chart looks about the same if you instead look at the relationship between growth over the preceding six months and the next six months. In fact, that correlation was stronger than confidence. In other words, if you had just predicted that the immediate future would be similar to the recent past, you would have done a better job projecting consumer spending during the last couple of decades than if you had relied only on a confidence survey.
Confidence surveys can make economic forecasts more accurate, according to some analysis -- but only in certain circumstances, and if used correctly.
For example, Michelle L. Barnes and Giovanni P. Olivei of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston found that forecasts are more accurate when they build in data from the Reuters/University of Michigan survey that is also used to calculate consumer sentiment. And Stéphane Dées and Pedro Soares Brinca of the European Central Bank found that confidence surveys can provide information about the future that economic fundamentals do not at economic turning points, and may be a factor in how crises spread between countries.
Those results suggest that why confidence shifts matters a great deal. At certain moments, ordinary consumers and businesses may instantly pick up on shifting economic fundamentals that would take time to show up in the official economic data.
For example, from July through November of 2007, consumer sentiment and confidence numbers plummeted, even as measures of consumer spending and employment were relatively steady. Credit was tightening and the housing crisis was worsening, but consumers seemed to pick up that the economy was on the verge of a recession (which began in December 2007) before it was at all clear from official data.
For every example like that, though, you can also find the reverse. Those same measures of confidence fell precipitously in September 2005, in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. That disaster ultimately had no major impact on the overall economy.
When confidence rises or falls suddenly, the move will predict a shift in economic performance only if something happens to the fundamentals to justify it. The early warning that confidence surveys offered on the 2008 recession was useful, but the downturn happened not because consumer confidence fell, but because the underlying forces around housing and credit that it reflected were so damaging. The post-Katrina drop wasn't matched by any major deterioration in economic fundamentals, so it was a mere historical blip.
One clue as to which precedent applies here is in the partisan breakdown in sentiment surveys. Instead of an across-the-board improvement in confidence, it appears that Republicans became sharply more confident while Democrats became somewhat less so. That implies that the postelection confidence surge was about conservatives feeling more giddy about their side winning than about the broad mass of Americans picking up on improving economic fundamentals not yet evident in the data.
The Trump administration's promises of major tax cuts, infrastructure spending and pro-growth regulatory policy have been slow in coming, but could conceivably change that over time.
But history shows that confidence alone won't cut it.

Full text: Here's a look at what's coming up this week. BANKING
A financial crisis-era case is a first in Britain.
A group of former Barclays executives will make their first court appearance in London on Monday after they were charged, along with the bank, last month with misrepresenting arrangements with Qatar when the bank raised money as the financial crisis worsened in 2008. The bank raised a total of $15 billion with two capital infusions from Qatar and other investors in June and October 2008, allowing it to avoid a government bailout, unlike several of its British banking rivals.
The criminal charges against Barclays are the first to have been brought in Britain against a bank for actions taken during the financial crisis. The four former executives -- including a onetime chief executive, John S. Varley -- are among the most senior bank managers to be charged anywhere in a crisis-era case. Chad Bray
AUTO INDUSTRY
A decline in auto sales is expected to continue.
Automakers on Monday report how many new vehicles they sold in June, and analysts expect some gloomy results. Kelley Blue Book is forecasting a decline of 3.6 percent, to 1.46 million new cars and light trucks. More important, if that outlook holds, June would be the sixth month in a row with declining sales. Most forecasters now expect auto sales to fall this year, to around 17.1 million light vehicles, down from the record 17.5 million sold in 2016. Neal E. Boudette
ECONOMY
A modest increase is seen in construction spending.
On Monday, at 10 a.m., the Commerce Department will release data on construction spending in May. After a strong increase of 1.4 percent in April, economists are looking for a more modest 0.3 percent rise in May. The residential portion of the report could be softer. That, in turn, could hurt the level of overall economic growth for the second quarter. Nelson D. Schwartz
MARKETS
U.S. markets will take a July Fourth breather.
On Tuesday, financial markets and government offices in the United States will be closed for Independence Day, giving Americans the chance to fire up their grills and, later, to watch the fireworks. Other global markets and governments will be open as usual. Zach Wichter
REGULATION
Uber's legal fight in Europe continues.
On Tuesday, Uber's battle with the European authorities will reach a new stage. The advocate general of the European Court of Justice is expected to publish an opinion on the ride-hailing service's operations in France. In May, the advocate general designated Uber as a transportation company, rather than a digital service, that would thus have to comply with regional rules. Prashant Rao
ECONOMY
Minutes will offer insight on the Fed's thinking.
The Federal Reserve delivered on schedule during the first half of the year, raising its benchmark interest rate in March and again in June. It was the first time since the financial crisis that its plans were not spoiled by economic wobbles. The minutes of the June meeting, which the Fed will publish on Wednesday, may provide some fresh information for those trying to gauge whether the Fed will stay on course during the second half of the year. Inflation remains more sluggish than the Fed would like, but Janet L. Yellen, the Fed's chairwoman, has pointed to the strength of job growth as a reason to believe that inflation will rebound. Investors are close to evenly divided on the chances of a December rate increase. Binyamin Appelbaum
The pace of hiring in June will offer clues on the job market.
On Friday, at 8:30 a.m., the Labor Department will release figures for hiring and unemployment in June. Wall Street economists estimate the economy added 180,000 jobs, with the unemployment rate remaining 4.3 percent. While economic reports have been mixed lately, experts will closely watch the pace of hiring in June to see if the strong job market so far this year remains on track. One wild card: Calendar quirks and the end of the school year could produce a drag on education jobs, reducing the total payroll figure. Nelson D. Schwartz
'Very difficult' trade talks are expected when the G-20 meets.
Trade will be high on the agenda when Group of 20 leaders begin two days of meetings in Hamburg, Germany, on Friday. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany has already predicted that the talks will be "very difficult." German-American relations are at a low after a series of reciprocal snubs, including one last week when organizers of an economic conference in Berlin cut short a speech that Wilbur Ross, the secretary of commerce, was delivering by video link. But Mr. Ross also called for the resumption of talks on a trans-Atlantic trade pact, a project dear to the Europeans. Jack Ewing

Full text: The bond market is flashing warning signals that bad times may be ahead for the stock market and the economy. That is probably not what most people want to hear -- stock investors especially. In the first half of the year, after all, stocks have performed spectacularly. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index returned 9 percent through June, churning out gains so regularly that it may seem churlish to note that clouds are appearing on the horizon.
Yet like a long-range forecast about a possible storm, an old and trusted financial indicator is telling us that trouble may be looming.
Simply put, while the Federal Reserve has been raising short-term interest rates since December, the bond market hasn't gotten the memo. The longer-term rates that are set through bond market trading have, for the most part, been declining, though there was a brief reversal in the last few days. But the disconnect over the last few months is a sign that bond investors believe economic growth and inflation are still weak and the Fed's actions are premature.
In the past, when disputes between the Fed and the bond market have persisted and grown, they have sometimes predicted big problems ahead -- like a plunging stock market and, eventually, a recession.
"I think people should be paying close attention to all of this right now," said David Rosenberg, chief economist and strategist at Gluskin-Sheff in Toronto. "When do you want to make sure you've got an umbrella? When rain is in the forecast or after it's already started pouring?"
Rain is coming, Mr. Rosenberg said, recommending that investors prepare by keeping enough cash on hand and setting up their portfolios to weather a storm. Regions like the eurozone are in an earlier stage of the economic cycle, he said, and may be better bets now. He urges caution in the United States. "I can't tell you when it is going to happen," he said, "but the economic cycle has not been abolished, and the chances of a recession are rising."
Though there is widespread concern about the behavior of the fixed-income markets, some analysts aren't as convinced that the forecast is quite so gloomy.
"There are grounds for concern, certainly," said Edward Yardeni, an independent economist and strategist, who has been studying the bond markets for decades. "But we're in a very strange world now, and it's hard to know how this will all play out."
"The economy is growing very slowly," he added, "at a pace of less than 2 percent per year, a rate that we used to call 'stall speed,' in the belief that when the economy is that feeble, it will fall into a recession. But that hasn't happened. The economy keeps growing, the stock market keeps going up, yet inflation remains very low. Where are we heading? There are many possibilities here. This isn't the economy we used to know."
Understanding the situation more deeply requires a little technical knowledge, so bear with me.
The Federal Reserve, along with other central banks, lowered short-term rates to near-zero levels during the financial crisis. With the economy on the mend, and asset prices like stocks and real estate soaring, Fed officials have begun raising short-term rates and say they intend to continue to do so.
What is unusual is that while the short-term rates that are controlled and heavily influenced by the Fed have been rising, the longer-term rates that the bond market sets have generally been dropping. That is why 30-year fixed mortgage rates are still below 4 percent, not all that much higher than they were a year ago.
The benchmark 10-year Treasury note, for example, declined from more than 2.6 percent in March to about 2.1 percent earlier in June. (It rose to 2.3 percent on Friday.) The rate on the 10-year note has been hovering at only about 1 percentage point above the Fed funds rate and 0.6 or 0.7 of a percentage point above the three-year Treasury note.
In bond market jargon, "the yield curve has been flattening" -- meaning short- and long-term interest rates have been moving closer to parity. In itself, such a development is unusual. But if the trend continues, with shorter-term rates rising above longer-term rates, the message from the bond market would amount to a flashing red light.
In such a case, bond mavens would say, "The yield curve has inverted," implying a reversal of the natural order of things, because most of the time, investors demand a yield premium for tying their money up for longer periods. An inversion would express deep skepticism about Fed policy and about the health of the economy. In the past, inversions have often predicted economic recessions and sharp declines in the stock market.
In fact, the last yield-curve inversion occurred in 2006 and 2007, according to data maintained by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Recession probabilities climbed, a model maintained by the New York Fed showed, and for good reason. The economy plunged into recession in December 2007, and, by some measures, it is still recovering. That's why the yield curve's messages are worth taking seriously.
That said, we don't have an inversion at this point, and we may not go there at all.
"Just because the yield curve is flattening doesn't mean that it will become an inversion," said Jeffrey Kleintop, chief global investment strategist at Charles Schwab. At the moment, he said, the British economy has been battered by "Brexit" and other worries and is quite vulnerable to a downturn. But he believes that the probability of a recession in the United States in the next 12 months is low. "I think we've probably got a year or more of growth ahead here," he said.
Mr. Yardeni remains bullish on United States stocks and is cautiously positive about the economy, saying low bond yields probably reflect persistently low inflation, which could be benign. Factors like demography (the aging of the baby boom generation), technology (the efficiency of smartphones and cloud computing) and globalization have changed the economy and reduced the inflation rate, he said.
Low inflation, along with low global interest rates, are at least partly responsible for the low bond yields in the United States. Those low yields have been a boon to people who own bonds because yield and price move in opposite directions: The benchmark Bloomberg Barclays Aggregate index returned more than 2.4 percent through June, despite predictions early in the year of bad times for bond investors.
The danger signals from the bond market could easily change to another pattern. The Fed may pause in raising short-term rates, though that could unleash irrational exuberance and drive already stretched stock prices higher. On the other hand, the bond market could blink, raising bond yields and relieving the tension. But that would be far more likely if, counter to current expectations, inflation or economic growth began to surge.
For now, the rally in risky assets like stocks continues unabated, while the conflict between the Fed and the bond market continues. Fed officials indicate that they are determined to keep raising short-term rates and to begin reducing the Fed's bond holdings -- perhaps preparing the central bank for action whenever the next recession comes.
At a bare minimum, the policy choices ahead are difficult. And for investors, there is ample reason for caution.

Full text: A sell-off in global bonds continued on Friday, as the realization set in that the end is near for policies that have kept interest rates exceptionally low for a decade. A speech this week by Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, signaled at best a very small change in the direction of monetary policy. But a confluence of upbeat utterances by Mr. Draghi and other top central bankers, along with growing optimism about the long-suffering eurozone, added up to an aha moment for financial markets.
Investors and traders seemed to suddenly realize that the era of ultracheap money is coming to an end. The revelation led to a wholesale reassessment of the relative prices of stocks and bonds.
Markets, which had been sleepy most of the year, awoke with a start. Yields on government bonds in Britain, Germany and the United States have all moved higher.
Mr. Draghi set off the excitement, perhaps unintentionally, with a speech Tuesday morning in Sintra, Portugal, that gave an unusually cheerful view of the eurozone. He ticked off a series of positive indicators, including 16 quarters of growth, with almost all countries benefiting, and 6.4 million new jobs. Only a few years ago, some economists were predicting the euro's demise.
The comment that investors picked up on, however, was convoluted and open to interpretation.
"As the economy continues to recover," Mr. Draghi said, "a constant policy stance will become more accommodative, and the central bank can accompany the recovery by adjusting the parameters of its policy instruments -- not in order to tighten the policy stance, but to keep it broadly unchanged."
Some analysts interpreted the cryptic sentence to mean that the European Central Bank will dial back its stimulus as the economy improves. That is not exactly news. Mr. Draghi said as much at a news conference this month.
But markets are acutely sensitive to any sign that the central bank will begin reducing the size of its purchases of government and corporate bonds, a process known as tapering. Mr. Draghi's remark was seen as a slight departure from his previous signals, and European Central Bank officials were quick to try to temper market reaction.
"Personally," Vítor Constâncio, the central bank's vice president, said in an interview with CNBC on Wednesday, "I don't see anything in the speech that would be different from, say, the previous two main interventions about monetary policy done by the president."
Still, bond markets took notice. Yields for 10-year bonds in Britain and Germany, which move inversely to price, have risen in the past week, indicating expectations that interest rates and inflation will rise.
The yield on the 10-year German government bond, the benchmark debt for the eurozone, has increased to 0.457 percent, from 0.253 percent a week ago. Britain's 10-year bond yield has also risen, to 1.246 percent, from 1.031 percent, while yields on 10-year Treasury bonds were up, as well.
In the United States on Friday morning, the Dow Jones industrial average and the S.&P. 500 were both slightly higher after losses the previous day. Earlier, Asian stocks fell, while shares in Europe were little changed.
"It is the opening for the E.C.B. to move toward tapering," said Carsten Brzeski, chief economist for Germany and Austria at ING Bank in Frankfurt.
The shift was subtle, but it was reinforced a day later when Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, made comments also interpreted as signaling a reduction in central bank stimulus. That was enough to lead to big movements in asset prices.
Mr. Brzeski said he thought the market reaction was overdone. "Apparently there are still market participants who thought this stimulus would last forever," he said.

Full text: SINTRA, Portugal -- The rise of robots has long been a topic for sci-fi best sellers and video games and, as of this week, a threat officially taken seriously by central bankers. The bankers are not yet ready to buy into dystopian visions in which robots render humans superfluous. But, at an exclusive gathering at a golf resort near Lisbon, the big minds of monetary policy were seriously discussing the risk that artificial intelligence could eliminate jobs on a scale that would dwarf previous waves of technological change.
"There is no question we are in an era of people asking, 'Is the Robocalypse upon us?"' David Autor, a professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, told an audience on Tuesday that included Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, and dozens of other top central bankers and economists.
The discussion occurred as economists were more optimistic than they had been for a decade about growth. Mr. Draghi used the occasion to signal that the European Central Bank is edging closer to the day when it will begin paring measures intended to keep interest rates very low and bolster the economy.
"All the signs now point to a strengthening and broadening recovery in the euro area," Mr. Draghi said. His comments pushed the euro to almost its highest level in a year, though it later gave up some of the gains.
But along with the optimism is a fear that the economic expansion might bypass large swaths of the population, in part because a growing number of jobs could be replaced by computers capable of learning -- artificial intelligence.
Policy makers and economists conceded that they have not paid enough attention to how much technology has hurt the earning power of some segments of society, or planned to address the concerns of those who have lost out. That has, in part, nourished the political populism that contributed to Britain's vote a year ago to leave the European Union, and the election of President Trump.
"Generally speaking, economic growth is a good thing," Ben S. Bernanke, former chairman of the Federal Reserve, said at the forum. "But, as recent political developments have brought home, growth is not always enough."
In the past, technical advances caused temporary disruptions but ultimately improved living standards, creating new categories of employment along the way. Farm machinery displaced farmworkers but eventually they found better paying jobs, and today their great-grandchildren may design video games.
But artificial intelligence threatens broad categories of jobs previously seen as safe from automation, such as legal assistants, corporate auditors and investment managers. Large groups of people could become obsolete, suffering the same fate as plow horses after the invention of the tractor.
"More and more, we are seeing economists saying, 'This time could be different,"' said Mr. Autor, who presented a paper on the subject that he wrote with Anna Salomons, an associate professor at the Utrecht University School of Economics in the Netherlands.
Central bankers have begun examining the effect of technology on employment because it might help solve several economic quandaries.
Why is workers' share of total earnings declining, even though unemployment is at record lows and corporate profits at record highs? Why is productivity -- the amount that a given worker produces -- stuck in neutral?
"The mere fact that we are organizing this conference here in Sintra testifies to our interest in that discussion," Benoit oeure , a member of the European Central Bank's executive board, said in an interview, referring to the "Robocalypse" debate.
Of particular interest to the European Central Bank is why faster economic growth has not caused wages and prices to rise. The central bank has pulled out all the stops to stimulate the eurozone economy, cutting interest rates to zero and even below, while printing money. Four years of growth have led to the creation of 6.4 million jobs. Yet inflation remains well below the bank's official target of below, but close to, 2 percent.
One explanation is that more work is being done by advanced computers, with the rewards flowing to the narrow elite that owns them.
Still, among the economists in Sintra there was plenty of skepticism about whether the Robocalypse is nigh.
Since the beginning of the industrial age, almost every major technological innovation has led to dire predictions that humans were being permanently replaced by machines.
While some kinds of jobs were lost forever, greater efficiency led to more affordable goods and other industries soaked up the excess workers. Few people alive today would want to return to the late 1800s, when 40 percent of Americans worked on farms.
Robocalypse advocates underestimate the power of scientific advances to beget more scientific advances, said Joel Mokyr, a professor at Northwestern University who studies the history of economics.
"Think about what computers are doing to our ability to discover science," Professor Mokyr said during a panel discussion, citing computers that can solve equations that have baffled mathematicians for decades. There may be breakthroughs that "we can't even begin to imagine."
There are other explanations for stagnant wages besides technology.
Companies in Japan, the United States and Europe are sitting on hoards of cash, doling out the money to shareholders rather than investing in new buildings, equipment or innovative products. Just why is another topic of debate.
Hal Varian, the chief economist at Google -- whose self-driving technology may someday make taxi drivers unnecessary -- said that the plunging cost of information technology "has virtually eliminated the fixed cost of entering a business." Companies can rent software and computing power over the internet.
And flat wages reflect the large number of women who have entered the work force in recent decades as well as the post World War II baby boom, Mr. Varian said, adding that those trends have run their course. "We are going to see a higher share going to labor," he said.
Yet already, disruptions caused by technology help account for rampant pessimism among working-class and middle-class people across the developed world.
Mr. Bernanke referred to polls showing that about twice as many Americans say the United States is on the wrong track than say the country is moving in the right direction.
As a result, "last November Americans elected as president a candidate with a dystopian view of the economy," Mr. Bernanke said.
Mr. Autor, co-author of the Robocalypse paper, concluded that it was too early to say that robots are coming for people's jobs. But it could still happen in the future.
"I say not Robocalypse now," Mr. Autor said, "perhaps Robocalypse later."

The False Premise of G.O.P. Tax Cuts

Full text: With the Senate effort to upend Obamacare suspended for the Fourth of July holiday, there's a chance to step back and examine the assumptions behind Republicans' longstanding objections to the social safety net -- as well as the flaws in those assumptions. From Ronald Reagan's invocation of a "welfare queen," to Mitt Romney's derision of "takers," to the House and Senate bills to cut taxes for the rich by taking health insurance away from tens of millions of people, the premise of incessant Republican tax cutting is that the system robs the rich to lavish benefits on the poor.
But here is an essential and overlooked truth: As a share of the economy, federal spending on low-income people, other than for their health care, has been falling steadily since it peaked in 2011, after the Great Recession, and while it's still slightly above the long-term average, it is declining, according to a recent series of reports by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
Mandatory non-health programs like food stamps, earned-income tax credits and Supplemental Security Income for impoverished elderly and disabled people currently equal 1.5 percent of the gross domestic product, only modestly above the 40-year average of 1.3 percent. Moreover, if spending on those programs continues its current downward trend, it will fall below the long-run average by 2024.
The costs of smaller non-health programs whose financing is appropriated each year are also shrinking, because of restrictions built into the budget process. Spending on these programs -- including housing assistance, worker training and heating aid -- equals 0.6 percent of the economy, the lowest level since 1970. If current trends hold, it will fall to 0.5 percent by 2027, the lowest level since 1966.
Spending has risen for Medicaid, which the Senate and House health care bills would slash. But the increase is not the result of generosity or waste. Much of it is from rising nursing home admissions as the population ages. Medicaid insures most nursing home residents -- after they have exhausted their savings.
Medical inflation, which usually rises faster than the general inflation rate, also pushes up Medicaid costs. But Medicaid is not driving that inflation. In fact, compared with privately insured care, Medicaid's costs have risen more slowly over the past decade and its costs per beneficiary are lower, partly because it has no profit margin.
By using Medicaid to cover millions of previously uninsured people, Obamacare chose the most economical and efficient part of the health care system to achieve a historic reduction in the number of uninsured. And by using tax increases on the well-to-do to pay for expanded coverage, the expansion did not add to budget deficits.
In the next decade, higher spending on low-income health programs is expected to be offset by lower spending on other low-income programs. So total federal spending on people struggling to get by is projected to hold steady.
That is not lavish. And it is not an excuse for tax cuts that deprive tens of millions of people of health insurance.

Full text: In 2010, when Democrats passed the Affordable Care Act, Republicans complained that they did so with no Republican support. Democrats responded by pointing out that the centerpiece of their plan -- tax credits to buy private insurance -- came from a Republican governor, Mitt Romney of Massachusetts. Something similar is happening today. Democrats are denouncing the partisan nature of the Republican effort to repeal and replace Obamacare. They're right to note that if the new bill passes the Senate, it will do so along party lines.
But the core planks of the Senate Republicans' health bill -- the Better Care Reconciliation Act -- borrow just as much from Democratic ideas as Obamacare borrowed from Republican ones.
The Senate bill's plan to reform Medicaid by tying per-enrollee spending to medical inflation through 2025 and to consumer inflation thereafter was borrowed from a nearly identical 1995 proposal by President Bill Clinton. Indeed, the main difference between the Clinton proposal and the Republican one is that the Clinton proposal would have tied per-enrollee spending to growth in the gross domestic product. Historically, medical inflation has been higher than G.D.P. growth.
The Senate bill replaces the A.C.A.'s Medicaid expansion with a robust system of tax credits for which everyone under the poverty line is eligible. Under Obamacare, you could enroll in private insurance exchanges only if your income exceeded the poverty line.
The tax credit system employed in the Senate Republican bill is stronger than the A.C.A.'s, because it adjusts the value of the credits not only to benefit those with low incomes but also to encourage younger people to enroll in coverage.
If the Republican plan increases participation by the young, premiums will become more affordable for everyone, because insurers set premiums to reflect an average of the costs of covering everyone who signs up for a given insurance plan. If only older people sign up, average costs in the plan are higher, leading to higher premiums. If young and old sign up, average costs are lower, and premiums go down.
The bipartisan heritage of the bill does not eliminate areas of philosophical disagreement between conservatives and progressives. It increases the role of private insurers, and decreases the role of state-run Medicaid programs in covering the uninsured. It reduces federal spending on health care, whereas Obamacare increased it. The Senate bill repeals or rolls back all of the A.C.A.'s tax increases.
But think about it this way. Imagine an alternate universe in which, in 2009, Democrats and Republicans passed a bipartisan health bill. That bipartisan bill -- let's call it the Baucus-Collins Act -- expanded coverage to tens of millions of Americans through a system of means-tested, age-adjusted tax credits in a voluntary-but-regulated individual insurance market where insurers were required to charge the same premiums to the sick and the healthy and guarantee coverage for those with pre-existing conditions.
In the Baucus-Collins Act, this increased spending on the uninsured was paid for through reforms of the Medicare program. In addition, the alternate-universe bill enacted a near-replica of Mr. Clinton's proposal for Medicaid reform in order to make the program fiscally sustainable over the long term. The act also capped the previously unlimited tax break for employer-sponsored health insurance, albeit at a high threshold.
Democrats and Republicans would be celebrating historic reforms that expanded coverage in a fiscally responsible way. Both blue states like California and red states like Texas would see substantial coverage gains. And we might be talking about further bipartisan efforts to strengthen the Baucus-Collins Act.
What I've just described as a bipartisan achievement is, in effect, the synthesis of Obamacare and the Senate Republican health care bill. Under this combination of reforms, states like Texas and Florida -- states that didn't expand Medicaid -- could see substantial coverage gains, because residents would be eligible for the Senate bill's means-tested tax credits.
It's likely that, if the Senate bill passes, more Americans will have health insurance five years from now than do today.
The Congressional Budget Office believes that solely because Republicans would repeal the A.C.A.'s individual mandate, by 2026, more than 15 million fewer people will buy health insurance, regardless of what senators do to direct more financial assistance to the poor and the vulnerable. That's not a flaw in the Senate bill; it's a flaw in the C.B.O.'s methods.
There are areas of the Senate bill that should be improved. Republicans should appropriate additional funds to help low-income enrollees afford their deductibles. States could choose to deploy these additional funds either as direct cost-sharing subsidies or as health savings accounts that individuals would themselves control.
But make no mistake: If the Senate passes this bill, after the partisan noise has died down, we will look at the 2010s as a period of substantial progress in American health care.

Full text: Stock indexes closed mostly higher on Monday, snapping a four-day losing streak for the Dow Jones industrial average on a day of largely listless trading. Utilities led the gainers as falling bond yields made high-dividend companies more attractive to investors seeking income. Phone companies and real estate investment trusts, which also tend to offer higher yields, made gains. Financial stocks also did well. Technology companies declined the most, giving up gains from a recent rally.
"It's a pretty low volatility day and a continuation of the trend we saw last week, which is equity markets largely treading water," said William Northey, chief investment officer at the private client group at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index added 0.77 points, or 0.03 percent, to close at 2,493.07; the Dow gained 14.79 points, or 0.1 percent, to 21,409.55; and the Nasdaq composite index slid 18.10 points, or 0.3 percent, to 6,247.15. The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks rose 1.86 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,416.64.
The major stock indexes were headed slightly higher in early trading but spent much of the day wavering between small gains and losses.
Early on, investors received discouraging news on the economy from the Commerce Department, which reported that orders for durable goods, items meant to last at least three years, slid 1.1 percent in May. That was the second straight decline and a larger drop than analysts were expecting.
That helped pull down bond yields, which have been weighed down by increased demand from overseas bond investors seeking better yields and persistently low inflation in the United States. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was down to 2.12 percent on Monday before bouncing back to 2.14 percent by late afternoon.
The trend made high-dividend stocks favorite buys for many investors seeking income, including utilities such as FirstEnergy and Exelon.
FirstEnergy climbed $1.18, or 4.1 percent, to $30.09, and Exelon gained 71 cents, or 1.9 percent to $37.21.
Several real estate investment trusts also climbed. Kimco Realty rose 48 cents, or 2.7 percent, to $18.47. CBRE Group picked up $1.13, or 3.2 percent, to $36.48.
Store Capital, a real estate investment trust, jumped 11.3 percent after news that Warren E. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway was buying a 9.8 percent stake. The stock gained $2.34 to $23.11.
Traders also bid up shares in companies undergoing leadership changes.
Pandora Media, a streaming music service, rose 2.2 percent after reports that its founder and chief executive, Tim Westergren, was stepping down. The stock picked up 18 cents to $8.46.
Supervalu, a grocery chain, gained 3.1 percent after it said Bruce Besanko would step down as chief financial officer. The stock climbed 9 cents to $3.03.
Arconic Manufacturing was the biggest decliner in the S.&P. 500, slumping 6 percent after a published report asserted that it knowingly supplied flammable panels for London's Grenfell Tower, where a fire on June 14 left 79 people dead or missing. Arconic slid $1.53 to $24.01.
Crude oil prices recovered after wavering in early trading. Benchmark United States crude rose 37 cents, or 0.9 percent, to settle at $43.38 a barrel in New York. Brent, the international standard, gained 29 cents, or 0.6 percent, to close at $45.83 a barrel in London. Oil prices hit their lowest point last week since August and are 15 percent below where they were a year ago.
Gold fell $10 to settle at $1,246.30 an ounce. Silver slid 8 cents to $16.57 an ounce, and copper was little changed at $2.63 a pound.
The dollar rose to 111.89 yen from 111.26 yen late Friday. The euro weakened to $1.1181 from $1.1199.

Full text: Here's a look at what's coming up this week. ECONOMY
Does automation kill jobs or promote growth?
The European Central Bank will host prominent economists in Sintra, Portugal, for its annual forum on monetary policy. The focus of this year's discussion, held Monday through Wednesday, will be productivity and investment, looking at, for example, whether automation kills jobs or leads to more growth and prosperity. Ben Bernanke, former chairman of the Federal Reserve, will be the dinner speaker on Monday. Jack Ewing
A report on durable goods may alter growth estimates.
On Monday at 8:30 a.m., the Commerce Department will report durable goods orders for May. Over all, economists are looking for a drop of 0.6 percent, weighed down by the volatile aircraft category. More significant will be core demand for durable goods like automobiles and appliances, which is expected to rise by 0.3 percent. If the core number is weaker than that, it could further pressure estimates for economic growth in the second quarter. Nelson D. Schwartz
China's premier will detail the state of its economy.
Premier Li Keqiang of China is expected to give his latest assessment of the Chinese economy's strengths and weaknesses in a speech on Tuesday in Dalian, in northeastern China. He will be the keynote speaker at the World Economic Forum's Annual Meeting of the New Champions, held five months after the forum's annual event in Davos, Switzerland. The emphasis this year is on the so-called Fourth Industrial Revolution of robots and web-enabled technologies. Keith Bradsher
Amid inflation worries, the Bank of England issues an outlook.
The Bank of England on Tuesday is expected to provide its semiannual outlook on the financial stability of the British financial system. Within the report, the central bank's Financial Policy Committee will lay out its assessment of the risks and weaknesses in the financial system and any measures needed to address them, including tightening capital requirements for banks.
Members of bank's Monetary Policy Committee have become increasingly concerned about the rise in inflation as the value of the British pound has depreciated against the dollar and other currencies since Britain voted last year to leave the European Union. In August, the central bank set its benchmark interest rate at 0.25 percent, a historic low, on concerns that "Brexit" could weigh on economic growth. But the British economy has performed better than expected in the past year, and inflation has increased. Chad Bray
BANKING
Stress test results will let banks move ahead on dividends.
On Wednesday, the nation's largest banks will learn how many dividends they can pay out to shareholders and the number of shares they can buy back this year. The Federal Reserve will announce the results of the second phase of its annual stress test. The banks easily cleared the first phase last week, demonstrating their huge stockpiles of capital and setting off renewed calls from the industry to loosen up some of the rules. Michael Corkery
MEDIA
Britain has options as it decides on Fox's plan to buy Sky stake.
The British government will rule by Thursday on whether 21st Century Fox can buy the remaining stake in Sky, a local satellite giant, that it does not already own. The country's government can approve the $14.9 billion deal, force concessions from Rupert Murdoch and his executives at Fox, block the takeover or ask regulators to carry out a more in-depth review. The British authorities will also make a separate judgment by Thursday on whether 21st Century Fox officials are "fit and proper" to hold Sky's broadcasting licenses. That comes at an awkward time for the company as it looks to move on from a sexual harassment scandal at Fox News. Mark Scott
ECONOMY
Slight rises are expected in income and consumption data.
On Friday at 8:30 a.m., the Commerce Department will release data on personal income and consumption in May. Economists are expecting a slight rise in both, but recent signs of softer automobile sales make the consumption number something of a wild card. As with the durable goods data out on Monday, economists will watch these figures closely for clues about overall growth in the second quarter, which ends Friday. Nelson D. Schwartz

Full text: "We do not believe in untrammeled free markets. We reject the cult of selfish individualism. We abhor social division, injustice, unfairness and inequality." This sounds like the manifesto of a hard-left political party, sternly aiming to cleanse society not only of a failed ideology (untrammeled free markets) but also of its cultural tenor (selfish individualism). Such critiques are now commonplace among insurgent left-wing movements in the United States and Europe, like the one that anointed Jeremy Corbyn leader of the British Labor Party and then increased the party's share of the popular vote. The above-quoted rejection of free-market capitalism, however, appeared last month in the manifesto of Britain's Conservative Party as it called an election designed to expand its parliamentary majority. It is the clearest evidence in plain prose, after the shocks of Brexit and Donald Trump's victory, of a world in interregnum: Mass disaffection has ended an era and inaugurated a turbulent new phase.
In this new reality, the rhetoric of the conservative right echoes that of the socialistic left as it tries to acknowledge the politically explosive problem of inequality. The leaders of Britain and the United States, two countries that practically invented global capitalism, flirt with rejecting the free-trade zones (the European Union, Nafta) they helped build. One sign of the general confusion is the desperate improvisation by politicians on the right as they try to respond to angry voters -- often at the risk of failure, as Theresa May's election campaign proved this month. May opposed Brexit before the referendum last year and then became its hard-line advocate within the Conservative Party. She began to echo Trump's denunciation of cosmopolitan elites, announcing that "if you believe you're a citizen of the world, you're a citizen of nowhere."
But in their appeals to the working classes, Trump and May also sound a lot like Bernie Sanders and Corbyn. Britain's Conservative Party mimicked its Labor rival by arguing for more transparency on executive pay and a higher minimum wage. The Tories, traditionally representatives of big business and the landed aristocracy, weirdly resembled the fiery trade unionists of the past in their demand that workers be represented on corporate boards.
In trying to build an "economy that works for everyone" -- a phrase that May lifted from Corbyn -- politicians of all stripes seem to be hurriedly abandoning the experiment in neoliberal economics that, beginning in the 1980s, disempowered government, enriched a minority and made many more feel left behind. You need recall only a few resonant declarations from the 1980s to appreciate the extraordinary counterrevolution underway in Anglo-America. "Society? There is no such thing," the Conservative prime minister Margaret Thatcher proclaimed. "There are individual men and women, and there are families." Thatcher wanted to "roll back the frontiers of the state." From across the Atlantic, her ideological kin Ronald Reagan shared the sentiment: "Government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem."
In Britain, Conservatives today claim that "government can and should be a force for good" and refuse to rule out tax increases for high earners. But back in the 1980s, they promoted a vision in which a community of self-interested individuals was a force for good. Government's role in economic planning, social welfare and wealth redistribution was stigmatized as a foe of individual initiative and self-regulating markets. "The market is a more powerful and more reliable liberating force than government can ever be," Thatcher asserted. Reagan promised: "You know, there really is something magic about the marketplace when it's free to operate. As the song says, 'This could be the start of something big.' "
And so it was: a social and intellectual as well as an economic and political revolution that transformed Britain and the United States. Thatcherism, which emerged as a series of improvised responses to Britain's economic crisis in the 1970s, mutated into a revolutionary ideology -- one that gave as much priority to "market forces" as Marxism once gave to class struggle.
Thatcher did not simply insist that markets were more effective economically than centralized planning. In her view, society itself could be reorganized around the laws of the market, with myriad self-interested individuals voluntarily competing with one another and producing optimal outcomes for all. Not since the heyday of social Darwinism in the 19th century, as the intellectual historian Daniel T. Rodgers wrote in "Age of Fracture," had "the idea of the beneficent results of competition cut so broad a swath through public and academic discourses or been called upon to do and explain so much."
It is also true that a range of cultural figures, from Harold Pinter to Angela Carter, denounced Thatcherism as wicked. But the harsh, moralizing critiques missed the true scale of Thatcher's reconstruction of social as well as economic realms. With her promise of prosperity, she managed to convince a significant part of the British population that with cheap credit and privatized public services, they would become stakeholders in the system. These invitations to private pleasures were adorned with invocations of British identity. Under Thatcher, there was a nationalistic surge of feeling "great again." In 1982, her determination to take back the Falkland Islands from their Argentine usurpers baffled Reagan. But the exploits of the Royal Navy perfectly consummated a British fantasy, nurtured today among Brexiteers, of regained imperial vigor.
Thatcherism was further entrenched by Tony Blair's "New" Labor Party (1997-2007) and David Cameron's Conservative "modernizers" (2010-16). Blair sought, with some help from Bill Clinton's triangulations, to put a human face on selfish individualism. Government, he suggested, was not the problem -- or not entirely. Its main task was to help individuals help themselves in the universal competition opened up by globalized markets. Individual wealth creation remained the goal: As Peter Mandelson, a theoretician of New Labor, put it, "We are intensely relaxed about people getting filthy rich." During the long reign of New Labor, inequality grew in Britain, and Thatcher-style deregulation and privatization proceeded, often by stealth through public-private partnerships. David Cameron, who proudly claimed to be Blair's "true heir," mounted a radical assault on the welfare state that revealed how deeply Thatcherism shaped a whole generation of British politicians (and journalists).
An influential part of the British media -- from the respectable Economist to the jingoistic Daily Mail -- presumed, along with the bipartisan Thatcherites, that "there is no alternative" to market forces. May, however, confirmed that not only is there an alternative (an interventionist state) but also that the right is eager -- in Britain as much as in the United States -- to appropriate this increasingly popular remedy of the left. Her party's manifesto was almost communistic in its assertion that the government's "power should be put squarely at the service of this country's working people." May even co-opted the Labor Party's old promise, originally denounced as "Marxist" by the Conservative Party, to cap energy prices.
Such ideological cross-pollination angered and baffled those still faithful to the memory of Reagan and Thatcher. The Economist denounced May's leftish program as "perverse" and "risky." George Osborne, a former chancellor of the Exchequer in Cameron's government, accused May of following Jeremy Corbyn in a terrible "retreat" from globalization.
May broke many ideological taboos in her eagerness to turn angry disaffection with Thatcher's long revolution into electoral gains. She still failed to persuade a clear majority of the British electorate of her credentials as a savior of the working people. The Conservative Party's savage cuts to spending on public services belied her redistributionist rhetoric -- which seemed more authentic when it came from Corbyn, who has promised to renationalize the railways and abolish tuition fees. For many British people, especially the young, the unabashedly socialist Corbyn seems more committed to reimposing the tax and regulatory regimes that force the rich to rediscover their social obligations.
Confronted with the nearly impossible tasks of Brexit and a struggling economy, May and her successors are doomed to failure with their impersonation of the left, let alone their rightist fantasy of restored greatness. As economic growth slows and inflation rises on the heels of Britain's decision to leave the European Union, the "hard" Brexit that May advocated looks even more like an imperial fantasy of self-sufficiency. It is most likely to be abandoned. In any case, the interventionist British state that could presumably heal the open wounds of inequality no longer exists. It has been hollowed out by decades of outsourcing and marketization. The Conservatives may cling to power by forming an alliance with an ultraright Northern Irish party. But increasingly forced to own their economic failures, they will struggle to rebrand themselves as partisans of an economy that "works for everyone."
A new economic consensus is quickly replacing the neoliberal one to which Blair and Clinton, as well as Thatcher and Reagan, subscribed; politicians are scrambling to articulate it, often blatantly breaking with their own history. Certainly, May's frantic left-wing posturing against inequality and social division confirmed that the Anglo-American revolution of the 1980s -- built around a strong prejudice against government and for free markets -- is over. At least in Britain. May, the conservative daughter of a country vicar, will probably be best remembered for advancing, inadvertently, a counterrevolution of the left.

Full text: THE Obamacare replacement that the House sent to the Senate might as well have had a note scrawled across its pages: Save us from ourselves. And the Senate bill, which just emerged from Mitch McConnell's underground laboratories into the light of day, does indeed improve upon the House's bill in several important ways. But is that enough to make the new version an electoral winner for Republicans? Probably not: At best one might say that it's a political suicide attempt that's somewhat less likely to succeed. Is it enough to make it sound public policy? Again, I think not: There are good ideas worked in, but still too much needless callousness.
The best argument for the bill is twofold. First, it officially reconciles the Republican Party to the idea that the government should provide support for working-class health insurance -- a necessary and overdue reconciliation. Second, it takes part of Obamacare's basic structure -- tax credits, pegged to income, to enable the lower-middle class and near poor to afford coverage -- and uses it to further two of the more compelling conservative health policy objectives: higher-deductible plans (which tend to reduce health care cost inflation) rather than comprehensive ones (which exacerbate it), and subsidies for private insurance rather than Medicaid for the near-poor, because private coverage may deliver better health.
So far, so reasonable. Also reasonable: a loosening of age-based price controls to make the exchanges more viable, and the fact that the Senate's bill's income-based credits are less stingy than the House bill's flat credit, and thus less likely to leave the poor and old with impossible premiums to pay.
But stinginess is still the essential problem for the Senate's alternative. High-deductible insurance plans make less sense the poorer you get, which is why they should ideally be encouraged from the top of the income ladder down -- through a cap on the tax subsidy for employer-provided insurance, ideally, a sound conservative idea left at the altar by this bill.
Pushing them from the bottom of society only makes sense if you're also willing to pre-fund health savings accounts for the near-poor, so that they can actually hope to pay their out-of-pocket costs. But this costs money that Republicans prefer to reserve for tax cuts. So the bill's attempted transition from Medicaid to private coverage would inevitably leave the people transitioning worse off, with deductibles that they couldn't pay even if their choice of doctors were technically better.
Meanwhile the middle-class Americans most justifiably aggrieved by Obamacare -- the people just above the subsidy cutoff, buying unsubsidized insurance that Obamacare made less affordable -- will gain little from the bill, and because the subsidy ceiling is lowered (from 400 percent of poverty to 350 percent) their ranks will actually increase.
The House bill, flawed in so many respects, at least made an effort on this front, since its flat subsidy was available to the people currently getting hosed by Obamacare prices. But maintaining a smaller version of that subsidy would have, once again, cost money, so instead the health care law's biggest losers will continue to lose out.
Politically, then, it's very hard to see a clear constituency for this bill, apart from the mostly wealthy voters who will appreciate its rollback of Obamacare's tax increases. Because it preserves more reasonable subsidies than the House bill and because its Medicaid drawdown happens in the distant 2020s -- which is to say, perhaps never -- it might not be an outright political catastrophe. But it's still the act of a party dedicated primarily to rescuing the rich from their tax rates, rather than stewarding the common good.
The best conservative health policy analysis proceeds from the controversial but, I think, correct perspective that much health spending is wasted and that people do not value or benefit from insurance as much as liberal technocrats presume. That analysis lends support to some of the provisions in this bill. But a more holistic, less plutocratic conservatism would not stop there: In an environment where de-industrialization and social breakdown have driven the working class Trumpward, saying we should not oversubsidize their health insurance should be followed by saying so that we can find other ways to help them.
Which the Republican Party could do, if it so chose. It could pass this bill, flaws and all, and then use the projected cost savings for a tax reform that doesn't just use, say, a small child tax credit as a fig leaf for huge upper-bracket tax cut, but that's actually organized around payroll tax cuts, refundable child tax credits, a larger earned-income tax credit, and other measures that would make up for the thinning of working-class insurance coverage with more cash in paychecks and bank accounts.
If that happens, I will recant my opposition to this bill. But I don't expect any such recantation to be required, because the Republican Party remains what it is, not what the country needs it to become.

Full text: FAIRFIELD, Conn. -- They bestrode the business world, or at least the suburban corporate campus, like a colossus. Sitting behind burnished wooden desks, in glass-walled corner offices like the one Jeffrey R. Immelt occupied at General Electric's former headquarters here, a select group of American chief executives were once more akin to statesmen than businessmen.
G.E. moved out of this sprawling Skidmore, Owings & Merrill-designed emblem of 1970s corporate modernism in favor of smaller, humbler digs in downtown Boston last year. And last week, Mr. Immelt unexpectedly announced plans to retire after 16 years in the top job, amid a sagging stock price and pressure from activist investors.
General Electric is just the latest storied name in corporate America to show its leader the door. Ford's chief executive, Mark Fields, had been in the job for less than three years when he was fired in late May. Two weeks earlier, Mario Longhi of U.S. Steel abruptly stepped down.
With these departures, the American era of the baronial chief executive, sitting atop an industrial dominion with all the attendant privileges, is drawing to a close.
It is one consequence of a transformed economic landscape in which many of the mega-corporations that defined 20th-century commercial life are confronting a host of new business and technological challenges. These changes -- in corporate leadership, on boards and across Wall Street -- are recasting the very idea of industry in America.
"The C.E.O. with a big office, a tenure of 10 or 20 years, in a suit and tie, is becoming a thing of the past," said Vijay Govindarajan, who served as G.E.'s chief innovation consultant in 2008 and 2009 and now teaches at Dartmouth's Tuck School of Business.
Mr. Immelt's exit from G.E. is particularly telling, given the company's reputation as a training ground for the future chief executives of other companies. He tried to change G.E., yet couldn't react quickly enough to the forces affecting companies like his.
These include the rising power of activist investors, who buy up stakes in companies and then demand changes. Activists are now hunting much bigger game, demanding double-digit annual earnings growth in a stagnant economy. Or else.
It is a reality only too familiar to John Mackey, the co-founder and chief executive of Whole Foods Market. On Friday, after pressure from activists -- a group he had referred to in an interview days before as "greedy bastards" -- Whole Foods was acquired by Amazon for $13.4 billion.
That deal also shows how the digital age has upended the competitive landscape, pitting companies in vastly different industries against one another.
"Who ever thought Ford would be competing with Google?" said Michael Useem, a professor of management at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania who has studied corporate leadership for decades. "But they are, and Mark Fields wasn't moving fast enough."
Boards, too, have changed, evolving from country-club-like collections of the same familiar faces into a much more diverse and demanding constituency.
To be sure, the money is better than ever. And pockets of unbridled ambition and occasional excess remain, especially in Silicon Valley, where Apple's new $5 billion spaceshiplike headquarters opened in April.
But for most of the Fortune 500, the unquestioned power and perks, the imperviousness to criticism from the likes of shareholders, and the outsize public profile that once automatically came with the corner office have gone the way of the typewriter and the Dictaphone.
"These people were bigger than life, and I saw it up close," said Kevin Sharer, a former chief executive of Amgen who worked as a top aide to Mr. Immelt's legendary predecessor at G.E., Jack Welch. "They were a combination of chief executive, statesman and rock star. They were unassailable."
A Naval Academy graduate, then an officer, before joining G.E. in 1984, Mr. Sharer said the only place that evoked a feeling of power comparable to the long hallways and corner offices of Fairfield in its prime was aboard the fast attack nuclear submarines where he once served as chief engineer.
"We had the confidence, the swagger, and we felt like we had unlimited industrial potential," he said. "Could we buy RCA or NBC? Of course we could. I'm not complaining, but this is absolutely not the case today."
That confidence extended well beyond the boardroom or the executive suite, providing a high profile not only in local communities, but in national affairs as well. Immediately after President Trump declared that the United States was pulling out of the Paris accord on global warming this month, Mr. Immelt offered a blunt dissent on Twitter.
"Disappointed with today's decision on the Paris Agreement," he wrote. "Climate change is real. Industry must now lead and not depend on government."
As Amgen's chief executive in the spring of 2009, Mr. Sharer visited the White House repeatedly to meet with Obama administration officials as they designed what would become the Affordable Care Act. He also played a key role in getting fellow pharmaceutical industry chiefs to support the legislation.
Now retired and teaching at Harvard Business School, Mr. Sharer said he would never do that today, as wading into bitterly partisan public debates offers little upside for corporate leaders, and risks damage to their company's reputation.
As a result, while companies in many ways have more economic and political power than ever, "chief executives now shy away from weighing in on the policy level or broader societal issues," Mr. Sharer said. "They're more focused on running their companies."
There are exceptions. Besides Mr. Immelt's outspokenness on the climate issue, last year Kenneth C. Frazier of Merck called out "bad actors" in the pharmaceutical industry for exorbitant price increases. Timothy D. Cook of Apple challenged Mr. Trump's proposed immigration restrictions in January.
Still, Mr. Immelt's exit leaves a void at the intersection of business and public policy, along with the retirement this year of Douglas R. Oberhelman, the Caterpillar chief who led both the Business Roundtable and the National Association of Manufacturers.
"If you start fooling around in Washington with the Business Roundtable or writing op-eds, activist investors will ask what you're doing," Mr. Useem said.
G.E.'s next chief executive, John Flannery, is highly regarded inside and outside the company, said Bill George, a professor at Harvard Business School who served as chief executive of Medtronic. Mr. George is much more optimistic than Mr. Sharer on whether chief executives will continue to speak out on broader issues, but he doesn't expect Mr. Flannery to emulate his predecessor's high profile.
"I don't see him stepping into that role," Mr. George said. "He's going to keep his head down and focus on the numbers."
The Fall of 'Carpet Land'
At Exxon Mobil, it's referred to as the God Pod. On the 11th floor of Procter & Gamble's headquarters in Cincinnati, there was Mahogany Row. And while the official name of the executive wing at G.E.'s Fairfield headquarters was E3, inside the company it was known as Carpet Land.
And no wonder. From the Persian rugs that lined the hallways to the plush wool floor covering in Mr. Immelt's office and private conference room, the carpets created the hushed atmosphere of a monastery or library.
"It was so quiet, you could feel the energy drain out of you," said Ann Klee, the G.E. executive who oversaw the move to Boston and the development of its new headquarters there.
What these executive aeries all shared was an Olympus-like sense of remoteness, authority and defined hierarchy.
At G.E., even in Carpet Land, office size grew in lock step with rank, and the biggest corner space was reserved for the chief executive. Not only did Mr. Immelt have his own bathroom, but his two administrative assistants had a private bathroom and a pantry.
The abundant perks -- in G.E.'s case, two helicopter pads, a shoeshine station and an executive dining room linked to the kitchen below by dumbwaiters -- fed the sense of exalted status. At the same time, faster economic growth and rising earnings camouflaged the cost of these indulgences.
With G.E.'s profits and shares soaring in the 1980s, Mr. Welch oversaw the construction of a private 28-room hotel known as the Guest House to serve visiting executives and others, with no expense spared on the parquet floors, wood-burning fireplaces and a Steinway piano, which was left behind when the company moved out.
"Nothing was off-the-shelf," said Bill O'Brien, a 19-year G.E. veteran who helped supervise the Fairfield facility. "With Jack Welch, everything was custom and the operation was five star, spot on."
Almost 16 years after Mr. Welch retired in 2001 and Mr. Immelt took over, G.E. shares have never regained their 2000 peak. So while Mr. Immelt successfully steered the company through a near-death experience during the 2008 financial crisis, refocused it on its industrial roots and shed its ancillary businesses, it became a natural target for activist investors.
One of those was Nelson Peltz, a onetime corporate raider who relied on Michael R. Milken's junk bonds for financing back when Mr. Welch was building his Guest House. Mr. Peltz has come a long way since then, having scored big wins forcing laggards like Heinz and Wendy's to improve their performance, and he acquired a $2 billion stake in G.E. in 2015.
By early this year, Mr. Peltz's Trian Fund was pressing G.E. for deeper cost cuts, and to link executive pay more closely to lower expenses and higher profits. In March, Bloomberg warned of "a do-or-die showdown" between Mr. Peltz and Mr. Immelt, while Fox Business reported that Mr. Immelt was in the "hot seat" and could be forced to retire ahead of schedule.
G.E.'s chief communications officer, Deirdre Latour, denied that activist pressure was a factor in Mr. Immelt's decision to retire. "Sixteen years is a long time," she said.
But at 61, Mr. Immelt is four years younger than Mr. Welch when he stepped down, and joins a long list of otherwise respected executives whose stately succession plans were seemingly interrupted by impatient investors.
"C.E.O. tenure is down from the 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s, and the G.E. situation is a reflection of that," said Jason D. Schloetzer, a professor at Georgetown University's McDonough School of Business. "Without this outside pressure, it's likely Jeff Immelt would have served out his term and retired at 64 or 65."
Now other chief executives are feeling the same pressure, including Mary T. Barra of General Motors. "She's being pulled in different directions," Mr. Schloetzer said, noting that G.M.'s shares have barely budged in the last two years, even as the broader stock market has soared.
If Ms. Barra can't turn things around in 12 to 18 months, Mr. Schloetzer said, she could share a fate similar to that of Mr. Fields at Ford.
Indeed, Mr. Fields's defenestration was more shocking in many ways than Mr. Immelt's slow-motion fade, said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld of the Yale School of Management.
"He's the poster child for what's happened to the C.E.O. job," Mr. Sonnenfeld said. "Until last month, people thought dynastic family capital like the Ford family was the solution to rampant short-termism. I'm sorry Ford forgot that recipe."
'Now the C.E.O. Has a Boss'
How did activist investors acquire such outsize power over publicly traded companies?
For starters, even as the activists' assets have grown, the number of public companies has shrunk drastically, said Matthew Slaughter, dean of Dartmouth's Tuck School. From 1997 to 2015, the number of companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq and the old American Stock Exchange dropped by half, falling to 3,766 from 7,507.
"With fewer public companies out there, any one of them is more likely to become a target of interest for one hedge fund or another," Mr. Slaughter said.
At the same time, activists are getting more, well, active. More than 300 American companies were targeted by these investors in 2015, up from just over 100 in 2010, according to Mr. Useem of Wharton. They're also becoming more successful at winning board seats, as fewer companies stagger their board elections over three-year cycles.
What's more, chief executives have less internal latitude. In 2001, more than half of new C.E.O.s also assumed the position of chairman when they took over. By 2016, only 10 percent occupied both roles, according to an analysis by Strategy&, the strategy and consulting arm of PwC.
"You don't have the C.E.O. running the board too," said Gary L. Neilson, a principal with Strategy&. "Now the C.E.O. has a boss."
Boards themselves have changed, Mr. Sonnenfeld added. A few decades ago, a Pittsburgh-based giant like U.S. Steel would draw board members from a local pool of business and community leaders.
"There was a downside in terms of cronyism, mutual back-scratching and a hesitance to criticize," he said. "The positive was that they were anchored in their communities and they invested in them. Now, for C.E.O.s, all the constituencies have changed."
So while boards are still willing to dole out huge golden parachutes to C.E.O.'s, even if they fail, they've become much more generous with money than they are with additional time.
The glaring exception to the trends outlined by Mr. Sonnenfeld is in the technology sector. But in many ways, these firms are the exception that proves the rule, because they play by different rules.
Google's Class B shares have 10 times the voting power of normal shares, enabling the founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, to retain control of the holding company Alphabet without owning a majority stake.
Facebook also has a multi-class stock structure that effectively guarantees that the founder Mark Zuckerberg will retain control even as he sells shares. And on this point, the company offers no apologies.
"This is not a traditional governance model, but Facebook was not built to be a traditional company," the company said last year. "The board believes that a founder-led approach has been and continues to be in the best interests of Facebook, its stockholders and the community."
The staggering profitability of the tech giants provides their leaders with more than a little of the swagger the industrial executives once possessed.
In 1990, the revenues of Detroit's Big Three automakers totaled $250 billion while they employed 1.2 million people, according to a study by the McKinsey Global Institute.
Silicon Valley's top three companies in 2014 had almost the same revenues before adjusting for inflation -- $247 billion -- but with 137,000 employees, they required a work force just one-tenth the size.
That kind of efficiency adds up to huge profits, soaring stock prices and few complaints from investors. Or as Brooks C. Holtom, a professor of management at Georgetown, put it, "If your stock is doing well, your job is safe."
The Shrinking Executive Suite
If the old quarters for G.E.'s top brass were akin to a pedestal, the new ones are more like a fishbowl. At G.E.'s interim headquarters in Boston, and in the permanent one set to open next year, the offices for top leaders have glass walls that enable them to see out and, in turn, let employees see in.
They are also much smaller. In Fairfield, a handful of senior G.E. leaders and their assistants occupied 44,000 square feet in the executive wing. Now the same group shares a total of just 7,800 square feet, less space than in the big mansions many C.E.O.s inhabit in places like Greenwich, Conn., or the Bay Area.
"It has a much more collaborative feel, and the glass replicates the transparency of working together," said Ms. Klee, the G.E. executive. "The Fairfield campus was beautiful, but it lacked the spark you feel here. It's a different time, and we like the power and energy and creativity that comes from mixing people together."
Perhaps, but like the fallen statue of Ozymandias in Shelley's poem, the old monuments to corporate power did possess a certain grandeur.
G.E.'s 66-acre Fairfield campus was purchased for $31.5 million last fall by Sacred Heart University, according to Michael J. Kinney, the school's senior vice president for finance and administration.
"There's not as big a need for corporate headquarters like this any more," said Mr. Kinney, who as a Kraft executive once worked in a similarly spectacular setting in the Taj Mahal-like General Foods building in Rye Brook, N.Y. "Those were the days."
Mr. Kinney has big plans to convert the old offices into classrooms, a business incubator space and a computer engineering center, among other things. Students will be trained in hospitality at the former Guest House.
As a result, the university has kept the campus in pristine condition since the last G.E. executives left. "The only things missing are the Persian rugs and the artwork," said Mr. O'Brien, who now serves as Sacred Heart's director of facilities.
"It's such a different vibe with the kids all here," said Mr. O'Brien, who added that he's still getting used to people strolling around the manicured grounds rather than quietly shuttling between hushed offices.
Walking around the pub in the Guest House Mr. Welch built, Mr. O'Brien confessed to a little nostalgia for G.E.'s glory days in Fairfield. "Can't you see just see Jack running the world from here in '87 or '88?"
The Vast Connecticut Headquarters That Housed General Electric for More Than Four Decades Included the Chief Executive's Office, Top, Where Jack Welch and Jeffrey R. Immelt Presided, and the Boardroom, Above. Grandiose Corporate Ambitions Can Still Be Seen in the Technology Industry, Like Apple's New $5 Billion Spaceshiplike Headquarters in Cupertino, Calif, Below.

Full text: CORRECTION APPENDED. Helmut Kohl, a towering postwar figure who reunified Germany after 45 years of Cold War antagonism, propelled a deeply held vision of Europe's integration and earned plaudits from Moscow and Washington for his deft handling of the fall of the Berlin Wall, died on Friday at his home in Ludwigshafen, Germany, the Rhine port city where he was born. He was 87.
"We mourn," his party, the Christian Democratic Union, said on Twitter in announcing his death.
With his diplomacy, resolve and readiness to commit huge sums to ending his country's division, Mr. Kohl was remembered by many as a giant of epochal times that remade Europe's political architecture, dismantled the minefields and watchtowers of the Iron Curtain and replaced the eyeball-to-eyeball armed confrontation between East and West with an enduring, if often challenged, coexistence between former sworn foes.
A physically imposing man -- he stood 6 feet 4 inches and weighed well over 300 pounds in his leadership years -- Mr. Kohl pursued his and his country's political interests as Germany's chancellor with persistent, even stubborn, determination. He could be "an elephant in a china shop," as he described himself, and he overcame European opposition to unification the same way he handled political opposition at home: by the force of a jovial yet dominating personality.
Germany in particular faced the challenge of engaging with a formerly dictatorial, Soviet-backed East and welding it to a prosperous West that drew its support from Western allies. Between the two lay a gulf of mistrust.
Unlike many Germans, Mr. Kohl never shied from expressing pride in what he often called "this, our Fatherland," even when the phrase unsettled many who had suffered at his country's hands in World War II. In dealing with the legacy of Germany's Nazi past, Mr. Kohl, who was a 15-year-old member of the Hitler Youth when the war ended, invoked what he called "the absolution of late birth" so often as to offend some listeners.
A politician most of his adult life, Mr. Kohl was chancellor for 16 years starting in 1982, longer than any German leader since Bismarck. He ruled the Christian Democratic Union as if it were his fief.
His political career ended with defeat, however, in elections in 1998, and his legacy was later clouded by disgrace over a party fund-raising scandal.
Even so, that was not the image that emerged in the many tributes offered on Friday.
"We feel that a life has ended and he who lived it will go down in history," Chancellor Angela Merkel said, her voice shaking. "In this moment, I am thinking with great respect and great gratitude on that life and work."
She added, "It will take some time before we realize what we have truly lost."
President Emmanuel Macron of France praised Mr. Kohl for his role both in unifying Germany and in solidifying Franco-German friendship. "We lose a great European," he said in a message in German on Twitter. And Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, ordered flags at the European Union to be lowered to half-staff in Mr. Kohl's honor.
In his later years Mr. Kohl was seen as a diminished figure, infirm and in a wheelchair after a fall resulted in a head injury in 2008 that made speech difficult for him. Far from focusing on his achievements as one of Europe's dominant statesmen, critics raked over his private life. His first wife, Hannelore Kohl, committed suicide in 2001, ostensibly because of a rare allergy to light, which had forced her into a nocturnal existence.
In 2008, shortly after his fall, Mr. Kohl announced his intention to marry a companion, Maike Richter, 35 years his junior and a former economic adviser in the chancellery. She was later accused of limiting access to him and his archives.
After the war, he spent his entire political life in the new Christian Democratic Union of Konrad Adenauer and Ludwig Erhard. Like them, he made his overriding goal the rebuilding of Germany within a united Europe.
Aware that Germany could be reunified only with the support of both the United States and the Soviet Union, Mr. Kohl formed close ties with the elder President George Bush and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. He also befriended President François Mitterrand of France, who helped him overcome the apprehensions of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain.
In a memoir, Mr. Kohl quoted Mrs. Thatcher as saying just after the Berlin Wall fell in 1989: "Twice we defeated the Germans! Now they're back again."
In 1985, to mark the 40th anniversary of the Nazis' defeat, Mr. Kohl insisted that President Ronald Reagan visit a German military cemetery in Bitburg, even after it was discovered that members of the Waffen-SS, the Nazi paramilitary force that carried out the Holocaust, had been buried there alongside ordinary German soldiers.
American officials sounded out Mr. Kohl about letting the president off the hook, to no avail, according to former Secretary of State George P. Shultz.
"President Reagan was deeply affected by the strength and vehemence of Kohl's views," Mr. Shultz wrote in his memoirs. "Kohl was adamant. He had a choice, Kohl said: President Reagan could go to Bitburg, or he could cancel and see the Kohl government fall."
The president went to the former Nazi concentration camp in Bergen-Belsen and then, without regrets, to Bitburg. But Mr. Shultz observed, "Kohl's unbending iron will did seem to demonstrate a massive insensitivity, on the one hand, to the troubles he was causing Ronald Reagan and, on the other, to the trauma this episode caused in the Jewish community around the world and, beyond the Jewish community, to all who remembered the Holocaust and its horrors."
Mr. Kohl was a German leader who could identify with the young men, some buried at Bitburg, who had been swept up by the Nazi war machine, and he was proud of his provincial roots in the nearby Palatinate region, close to the French border. After rising to the chancellor's office in 1982, he won four elections in a row -- two as chancellor of West Germany and two after it absorbed the Communist German Democratic Republic. But he lost the fifth, in 1998, when the Social Democrats returned to power under Gerhard Schröder.
A year later, German prosecutors discovered a network of secret bank accounts and charged Mr. Kohl with using them to hide illegal contributions to his party. Expressing regret for "mistakes," Mr. Kohl refused to disclose the names of any donors, even after a parliamentary inquiry was begun. In early 2001, Mr. Kohl paid a fine of more than $100,000 to end a criminal case against him and left Parliament the next year.
Months earlier, though, potential successors had begun to circle, sensing that the scandal had stripped away Mr. Kohl's hallmark mantle of political invulnerability. In December 1999, Ms. Merkel, one of his Christian Democratic Union protégés from the formerly Communist part of Germany, wrote in the daily newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung that it was time for Mr. Kohl to withdraw from politics and "make way for the successors, the younger generation."
Ms. Merkel took over the Christian Democrats in 2000 and became chancellor in 2005, the first woman to hold the office.
Well into his retirement, Mr. Kohl, who had once referred to Ms. Merkel as "das mädchen" -- the girl -- continued to snipe at her from the wings, questioning her handling of European politics. In 2016, he urged her to show restraint after Britain voted to leave the European Union. But by then, Ms. Merkel was eyeing a fourth run at the chancellery in 2017 -- potentially equaling or even surpassing her one-time mentor's record in Germany's highest office.
Witness to War
Helmut Joseph Michael Kohl was born in Ludwigshafen on April 3, 1930, the third and last child of Cäcilie E. and Hans Kohl, a civil servant and tax expert who had been a soldier in World War I.
When Hitler invaded Poland in 1939, Mr. Kohl's father answered the call to arms and did not return home until 1945. His elder brother, Walter, also volunteered and was killed in action in 1944. By then, Ludwigshafen was under almost daily attack from Allied bombers, and young Helmut, who, like most boys his age, had become a member of the Hitler Youth, was pressed into service to dig charred corpses from the ashes. Later, he fed ammunition to antiaircraft guns in the Bavarian Alps.
In the spring of 1945, after surviving a heavy Allied bombing of Berchtesgaden and its environs in the Bavarian Alps, where Hitler had a retreat, Mr. Kohl decided the war was over for him. With a few friends, he set off on foot for his hometown, 250 miles away.
"Still in our Hitler Youth uniforms and without papers of any kind, we avoided the roads, on which truck after truck of American troops were rolling, and ran along the rail lines or over the crossties," Mr. Kohl wrote years later.
After the Nazis capitulated in May, the group fell into the hands of Polish laborers, who gave them a beating. When he finally got home, in early June, he found Ludwigshafen three-quarters destroyed but the Kohl family home still standing.
There, as a student preparing for university studies, he met a refugee from East Germany, Hannelore Renner, whom he married in 1960.
Ms. Kohl projected a public image of traditional middle-class respectability, but after her suicide in 2001, Heribert Schwan, a journalist who had ghostwritten three volumes of Mr. Kohl's autobiography and claimed to have had close access to his wife, depicted her as a tragic figure who had worn the trappings of a political spouse "like armor" to shield her unhappiness in the role. She had been profoundly disturbed by his refusal to identify anonymous donors in the party financing scandal that ended his political career, Mr. Schwan said.
With his second marriage, critics said Mr. Kohl appeared to be in thrall to his wife, Maike. She was credited both with tending to him assiduously in his infirmity and limiting access to him by his former associates, including Juliane Weber, his onetime office manager and confidante for three decades.
Der Spiegel, an influential newsmagazine that acknowledged a troubled relationship with Mr. Kohl, said in 2012 that the "link between political history and the physical frailty of this once-powerful man" had "turned his twilight years into a tragedy that is being closely watched in Germany."
Besides his second wife, Mr. Kohl's survivors include his sons, Walter and Peter. A complete list of survivors was not immediately available.
Mr. Kohl went to college in Frankfurt and later in Heidelberg. He joined the Christian Democratic Union when he was only 17. His doctoral thesis in history, submitted a decade later, was on the rebirth of political parties in his home region after the war. The next year he was elected to the legislature of the postwar federal state of Rhineland-Palatinate, and in 1967 he became the state premier.
But his ambition was to be his party's national leader. He realized that goal in 1973, a year before Willy Brandt, the Social Democratic chancellor who had begun a hotly contested policy of gradual reconciliation with Communist East Germany and the Soviet Union, resigned after it was discovered that a Communist spy had infiltrated his office. Mr. Kohl ran against Brandt's successor, Helmut Schmidt, in 1976, came surprisingly close to victory, and moved to Bonn to lead the opposition in the national Parliament.
He became chancellor in 1982 when Mr. Schmidt's coalition partners, the Free Democrats, switched their support to Mr. Kohl's party. But despite having run campaigns with the slogan "Freedom or Socialism," he left mostly unchanged the Brandt-Schmidt policy of gradual opening to the Communist East.
In office, he occupied a villa behind his Bonn office on the Rhine during the week and liked to dine at unprepossessing Italian restaurants. He commuted home to Ludwigshafen by helicopter on weekends, when he could indulge in his favorite German dish, stuffed sow's belly, often inflicted on foreign visitors invited down for an evening at his home.
A Handshake at Verdun
Mr. Kohl saw German reconciliation with France as vital to restoring German respectability. Not invited to ceremonies in June 1984 to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the Allied landings in Normandy, he went in September to Verdun, the scene of costly French-German battles in World War I, for an emotional handshake over the graves of the fallen with President Mitterrand.
After he won the 1987 elections, Mr. Kohl was host of the first visit to Bonn by an East German Communist leader, Erich Honecker, who was seeking billions of West German marks to prop up his ailing economy. His cordiality puzzled those who had long thought of Mr. Kohl as staunchly anti-Communist, and long after East Germany disappeared, he successfully resisted attempts to open secret files that Communist intelligence had maintained on his activities.
Mr. Kohl and Mr. Gorbachev had their first meeting in Moscow in October 1988. But by then communism had begun to unravel all over Eastern Europe, and it became clear that Mr. Gorbachev was not ready to use Soviet military might to keep that from happening.
By the summer of 1989, tens of thousands of people were fleeing East Germany through Hungary and Czechoslovakia to West Germany, and Mr. Kohl saw that reunification might be within reach.
After Mr. Honecker was deposed and his successors opened the Berlin Wall on the night of Nov. 9, 1989, Mr. Kohl surprised his allies with a prompt 10-point plan for a German confederation.
But the enthusiastic crowds he encountered in subsequent visits to East Germany convinced him that confederation was not enough. Confident of support in Washington, he made a 52-hour visit to Moscow and a retreat in the Caucasus Mountains in July 1990 and secured Mr. Gorbachev's acquiescence in the unification of the two German states in the Federal Republic, within NATO.
"We did not take part in the war directly, we do not have it on our conscience," Mr. Kohl wrote of Mr. Gorbachev, "but we still remember the war in our mind's eye, we have seen its horrors, we have experience that others do not have. And we must bring all of it to bear to advance civilization."
That Oct. 3, Mr. Kohl celebrated reunification with a fireworks demonstration in Berlin. It was the apogee of his career.
East Germany, thought to have had the strongest economy of any European Communist country, turned out to be bankrupt. Mr. Kohl gave eastern Germans the deutsche marks they had long craved, though at a 1:1 exchange rate, which left their inefficient state-run industries unable to compete on Western economic terms. Many collapsed.
But in the first postwar all-German elections, in December 1990, he campaigned on the promise that unity would bring a flowering in the East, and won with 43.8 percent of the vote for his party.
Within a year, though, more than a million people in the East were out of work. Leftist demonstrators in Halle, in the East, spattered Mr. Kohl with eggs, calling him a "liar." Mr. Kohl went after them with clenched fists before being restrained. In the West, taxpayers felt taken advantage of when government spending to rebuild eastern Germany's shattered infrastructure sunk the deficit toward $400 billion. Inflation accelerated, and when the central bank pushed up interest rates, it was blamed for causing recession in much of Western Europe.
The prospects for European unity also suffered. At the end of 1991, Mr. Kohl and his fellow leaders, meeting in Maastricht, the Netherlands, had agreed to an ambitious plan for European economic, monetary and political union. But almost immediately the project became bogged down in the economic difficulties and squabbling over Europe's failure to end the war in the Balkans. Some blamed the Kohl government for the start of the war, saying it had been hasty in recognizing Croatia, a German ally during World War II, when it broke away from Yugoslavia.
"I've been wrong about some things since 1990, but who hasn't been?" Mr. Kohl said in 1994, when polls were predicting yet again that his era was ending. He won elections that year, too, but the government's majority was razor-thin.
Mr. Kohl began warning that the German welfare state, with its robust mark, 35-hour workweek and five-week vacations, was becoming uncompetitive in the global economy. Unemployment soared to nearly 4.7 million -- 12.2 percent of the work force -- within two years.
Unemployment like this had been unknown in Germany since the 1930s, when it contributed to the rise of the Nazis. Mr. Kohl's party had created the welfare state in part to prevent such horrors from ever happening again. But now, he told his compatriots, belt-tightening and budget-cutting would be the order of the day, with the hope that a united Europe with a common currency would eventually bring renewed prosperity.
Long an advocate of a single European currency, Mr. Kohl was accused of ignoring what turned out to be one of its most stubborn challenges after it came into circulation: Without a political and fiscal union to buttress it, the currency, the euro, remained prey to crises, like the turmoil that drove Greece to the brink of economic collapse in the mid-2010s.
'Ruining My Europe'
At the close of the 20th century, Mr. Kohl had resisted pressures to turn over the party leadership to somebody younger. Instead, he decided to prove his critics wrong and run for chancellor again in 1998 against Mr. Schröder's Social Democrats, who argued that after 16 years it was time for a change. Mr. Kohl's party went down to defeat.
Mr. Schröder was no more successful in solving the unemployment problem than his predecessor, but Ms. Merkel eventually reaped the benefits of an overhaul introduced under Mr. Schröder.
In recent years, with European unity shaken by recession, Mr. Kohl was outspokenly critical of his successors for, as he put it, "ruining my Europe." Among other things, he faulted them for insisting on financial austerity in response to the global recession that began in 2007.
But he denied dismissing them as imbeciles, as he was quoted as doing in "Legacy: The Kohl Transcripts" (2014), a book by Mr. Schwan and Tilman Jens that drew on hundreds of hours of confidential interviews that Mr. Schwan said he had done in ghostwriting Mr. Kohl's memoirs. One quotation had him saying that Ms. Merkel "didn't even know how to properly use a knife and fork."
Mr. Kohl disputed the accuracy of that and 115 other quotations and sued the authors and their publisher, a subsidiary of Random House, for violation of privacy. In April 2017, a court in Cologne awarded him damages of a million euros ($1.1 million), a record. The defendants appealed.
Later in 2014 he published "With Concern for Europe," a book written with his wife. "Have we lost our minds -- and our sense of responsibility, too?" he wrote.
For all the rancor surrounding Mr. Kohl at home, however, his standing among former allies on the world stage remained largely intact.
"In more than size, he was the largest figure on the European continent in decades," former President Bill Clinton wrote in his memoir, "My Life," in 2004. And in a statement on Friday, the elder former President Bush called Mr. Kohl "a true friend of freedom, and the man I consider one of the greatest leaders in postwar Europe."

Full text: We're following major market developments throughout the day. Tech Stocks Are Down Again
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was down slightly on Thursday afternoon, with shares of technology giants leading the decline. Tech stocks have been slipping since Friday and the Nasdaq is on track for its second consecutive weekly loss.
The benchmark S. & P. index has risen 17 percent in the last year, leading to recent fears that stocks are overvalued.
Snap, the parent company of the social messaging app Snapchat, declined nearly 4 percent on Thursday, nearing its March initial public offering price of $17. The stock is down 28 percent since that offering, as Facebook continues to copy many of Snapchat's most popular features.
Booz Allen Under Investigation
Booz Allen Hamilton, the consulting firm, said on Thursday that the Justice Department was conducting an investigation related to some of its cost accounting and indirect cost charging practices with the United States government. The firm earns billions of dollars each year in intelligence work.
The company's shares fell about 12 percent to $34.50 after the close of trading.
Bank of England Holds Rates Steady
The Bank of England took a more hawkish tone than expected on Thursday. The central bank held its main interest rate steady, but warned that inflation, after rising at a faster than expected pace in May, could remain above the central bank's target "for an extended period."
The central bank's monetary policy committee voted 5 to 3 to keep its benchmark interest rate at 0.25 percent, the level since August when it was cut to a historic low.
The vote was closer than expected, with the three dissenting committee members voting for an immediate increase to 0.5 percent. Many economists had expected the central bank to keep the rate steady, but not by such a narrow vote.
The surprise split in the vote sent the pound higher against the dollar.
The Bank of England said that inflation, at 2.9 percent, had risen well above the monetary policy committee's expectations and could exceed 3 percent by autumn. The bank considers a 2 percent inflation rate as a sign of healthy economic growth.
Inflation "is likely to remain above the target for an extended period as sterling's depreciation continues to feed through into the prices of consumer goods and services," the bank said in a news release.
The committee also voted to keep its bond-purchasing program at the same level -- 435 billion pounds, or about $555 billion.
The decision came a day after the Federal Reserve, as expected, raised its benchmark interest rate to 1.25 percent, the third-consecutive quarterly increase by the central bank amid economic expansion in the United States. -- CHAD BRAY

Yellen, the Fed and the Case of the Missing Inflation

Full text: Inflation has stubbornly stayed lower than the Federal Reserve has desired for the past eight years, and it has been falling in the last few months. In a move that could well define her chairmanship of the central bank, Janet Yellen is betting that falling prices are a temporary blip that will soon be forgotten. If her forecast is right, the Fed policy meeting on Wednesday will turn out to be a nonevent in a gradual return to normal policy. If she's wrong, the June 2017 meeting will look like a giant unforced error that unnecessarily prolonged an era in which the Fed proved impotent to get inflation up to the 2 percent level it aims for and lost credibility needed to fight the next downturn.
The Federal Reserve is assigned a "dual mandate" -- its mission is to achieve maximum employment and stable prices. Ms. Yellen emphasized that the job market looked quite healthy, justifying the Fed's decision to raise interest rates for the second time this year and fourth time in 18 months.
She is a labor market scholar, after all, and in her view the labor market looks pretty darn good, with a 4.3 percent unemployment rate and the economy still producing more new jobs than it is new workers.
Using the economic models on which the Fed has traditionally relied and which were taught to generations of undergraduates, that would seem to set the stage for higher inflation. Employers would compete for workers and hike wages, fueling broader price increases for all types of goods and services.
But there is little evidence this cause-and-effect is actually happening.
The Fed has defined stable prices as inflation of 2 percent. Right now, not only are key inflation measures below that level, but they are also falling. The most recent reading of the inflation measure favored by the Fed is at only 1.5 percent. And the Consumer Price Index, excluding volatile food and energy prices, rose 1.7 percent over the year ended in May, down from 2.2 percent in February.
In other words, the jobs side of the mandate would seem to offer Ms. Yellen and her colleagues a green light to raise rates steadily to keep the economy from overheating, while the inflation side would seem to offer instead a yellow light, and arguably a red one.
But at Wednesday's meeting, only one official with a vote dissented from the rate increase: the Minneapolis Fed president, Neel Kashkari. Moreover, 12 of 16 Fed officials think that at least one more rate increase this year would be justified, based on newly released projections the central bank released.
This sure looks like a central bank that has set its course for 2017 and will continue on it unless strong evidence emerges that it has misread the state of the economy. The line between intellectual confidence and mere stubbornness can be thin, however.
Ms. Yellen emphasized that monetary policy "is not on a preset course" and that she and her colleagues "have taken note of the fact that there have been several weak readings" on inflation lately.
But, she added, "it's important not to overreact to a few readings, and data on inflation can be noisy." Twice, she mentioned factors that seem to be temporarily depressing inflation measures. A pricing war among mobile phone service providers has led to falling prices for cellphone plans, and prescription drug prices have made what appears to be a one-time drop.
In effect, she argued, brushing off those one-time drops is the equivalent of brushing off a one-time surge in, say, energy prices that may drive inflation higher but not affect the long-term trend on inflation.
But evidence from the bond market suggests that global investors aren't so sure. The gap between rates on regular and inflation-protected bonds suggests that consumer prices in the United States will rise only 1.6 percent a year in the next five years, down from 2 percent in March. Even for the five years after that, the rate of inflation implied by bond prices has fallen from 2.1 percent to 1.9 percent.
The recent inflation numbers are not so low as to suggest some deflationary spiral is imminent. It's probably not worth obsessing too much over prices rising 1.5 percent instead of the targeted 2 percent. The direct cost of mildly undershooting the Fed's inflation target is low, favoring creditors over debtors, for example, but it's not likely to cause any broad economic distress.
What is worrisome is not direct economic damage, but the fact that the Fed has missed its (arbitrary) 2 percent target in the same direction -- undershooting -- year after year. If it's not a drop in prices for cellphone plans, it's a falloff in oil prices, or cheaper imports because of a strong dollar.
That in turn implies that the low-growth, low-inflation, low-interest-rate economy since 2008 isn't going anywhere. This would prove especially damaging if the economy ran into some negative shock; a lack of Fed credibility could leave it less able to prevent a recession. Already, the combination of lower inflation and interest-rate rises adds up to higher "real," or inflation-adjusted, interest rates, which could constrain growth in the quarters ahead.
Setting monetary policy, it has been said, is akin to driving a car by looking only in the rearview mirror. When Federal Reserve officials set interest rate policy, they can look only at how the economy has performed in the past and feed information into models to make decisions that will not show their effects until months into the future.
Ms. Yellen has earned the benefit of the doubt as an economic forecaster: Her abilities to peer into the rearview mirror and direct the car appropriately are strong. She was early to understand the peril of the financial crisis and the need for aggressive monetary intervention, according to transcripts of Fed meetings from 2007 to 2010. Her decision to plod ahead with gradual rate increases as chairwoman looks pretty good so far -- the job market is looking healthier than it has in a decade.
There's a good chance the Yellen chairmanship will end early next year, if President Trump declines to reappoint her. For the sake of the economy, we should hope she has one more good call in her, and that the June 2017 Fed meeting is one we soon forget.

Full text: Stocks on Wall Street dipped Wednesday as investors worried about weak retail sales and oil prices sank. The Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the third time in six months. The Commerce Department said retail spending declined in May, which surprised analysts. Investors reacted by buying traditionally safe assets like government bonds and high-dividend companies and by selling stocks from industries that depend more on economic growth. Bond yields hit their lowest level of 2017. Oil prices also hit an annual low after the government's weekly report on oil stockpiles.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slid 2.43 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,437.92. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 46.09 points, or 0.2 percent, to a record 21,374.56. After a late tumble in technology stocks, the Nasdaq composite index lost 25.48 points, or 0.4 percent, to 6,194.89.
In the past few weeks, Wall Street has been disappointed by several economic reports. That did not appear to change the Fed's thinking, even though higher interest rates tend to slow economic growth. For years, investors have hoped for faster growth.
"This economy has always been something of a healthy tortoise," said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. "I think growth will pick up a bit, but there is sort of a failure to bounce in this economy."
The Commerce Department said people spent less money at gas stations, department stores and electronics retailers last month. GameStop, a video game seller, was down 35 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $21.55, and Kohl's, a department store chain, dropped 38 cents, or 1 percent, to $37.66.
In a separate report, the Labor Department said consumer prices had slipped, partly because of lower energy prices. That is one reason there has been little inflation in the economy lately, a continued concern for Federal Reserve policy makers.
Bond prices jumped. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.13 percent from 2.21 percent. Earlier, the 10-year note hit its lowest level since November.
Oil futures plunged after the United States said oil supplies had shrunk only slightly last week while gasoline stockpiles grew. Benchmark crude fell $1.73, or 3.7 percent, to settle at $44.73 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, shed $1.72, or 3.5 percent, to close at $47 a barrel in London.
Exxon Mobil lost 89 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $82.07 and Anadarko Petroleum sank $1.94, or 3.9 percent, to $47.28.
The Fed also gave more details about its plans to shrink its bond portfolio. This year, it will reduce the amount of principal payments it invests in new bonds. It does not plan to sell any bonds.
The dollar slid to 109.53 yen from 109.96 yen. The euro edged up to $1.1220 from $1.1212.
Biogen, a drugmaker, fell and Alexion Pharmaceuticals rose after the companies said Paul Clancy, chief financial officer of Biogen, would move to Alexion in the same capacity at the end of July. Analysts said Wall Street had a lot of respect for Mr. Clancy, who has been Biogen's chief financial officer for 10 years.
Biogen declined $8.05, or 3.1 percent, to $253.37, and Alexion gained $10, or 9.3 percent, to $118.
Gold rose $7.00 to $1,272.80 an ounce. Silver jumped 37 cents, or 2.2 percent, to $17.14 an ounce. Copper slipped 2 cents to $2.57 a pound.
The German DAX advanced 0.3 percent and the French CAC-40 lost 0.4 percent. The British FTSE 100 fell 0.3 percent. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 retreated 0.1 percent, and the Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong advanced 0.1 percent. In South Korea, the Kospi retreated 0.1 percent.

Full text: A President at War With His Fed Chief, 5 Decades Before Trump By Kevin Granville
A new president takes office with big plans, and needs a booming economy to help underwrite his promises. A Federal Reserve chief sees an economy starting to overheat, and begins warning of the need for higher interest rates.
They were bound to clash: Lyndon B. Johnson, the new president, and William McChesney Martin, the longtime, fiscally conservative Fed chairman.
It is a conflict from the 1960s with echoes in the present day, as President Trump's campaign talk of robust tax cuts, job growth and economic expansion is bumping up against calls by the Fed chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, for a cautious rise in interest rates, lest inflation get out of control.
Today, when Ms. Yellen acts, we figure she is not doing Mr. Trump's bidding. She and Fed policy makers are expected this week to increase the benchmark rate for the fourth time in less than two years. But that independence was not always assumed in the Fed's early years, and Martin's standoff with Johnson provided a template for interactions between the Federal Reserve and the White House for decades to come.
Within days of ascending to the White House after President John F. Kennedy's assassination in November 1963, Johnson had an agenda that included passage of a big income tax cut that had been one of Kennedy's legislative priorities. A year later, after winning the 1964 election, Johnson pursued fighting two wars: one on poverty, and one in Vietnam. Both would lead to significant budget deficits.
Martin saw all this additional spending as a formula for inflation. He also feared he was not getting accurate information from the administration on their spending plans -- that some spending on the Vietnam War was not being reported.
Their conflict led to a fiery climax at the Johnson Ranch near Johnson City, Tex., when Martin was unwilling to bend to the president's will.
1.
The relationship -- destined to range from warm to cagey to confrontational -- was off to a good start when, eight days after the tragic shooting in Dallas, Johnson telephoned Martin to express gratitude for a note of support.
Johnson: Bill, I just want to thank you for your most thoughtful and generous letter and I appreciate it so much, and I feel quite comfortable and get strength from the knowledge that you're at that desk.
Martin: Well, that's very nice of you, Mr. President. I'm just delighted to do anything I can to be of help. You can count on me completely.
Johnson: Well, you just assume that you're starting out with someone who doesn't know much about your shop and then you start to tell me what I ought to know about it.
Martin: Well, I certainly will help in every way that I can, Mr. President. I'm sure you know a great deal already, but I'll help in every way I can.
2.
Martin, named the Fed chairman by President Harry S. Truman, was overseeing an economic expansion that had begun two and a half years earlier, in early 1961. But he was keenly aware of the Fed's role of anticipating and preventing recessions. And he liked a good line. "The function of the Federal Reserve," he said, "is to take away the punch bowl just as the party is getting good."
Johnson, the shrewd Texas lawmaker who had seemed out of sorts as Kennedy's vice president, had no interest in slowing growth. In his first major address after taking office, he called on Congress to pass the income tax cuts first proposed by his predecessor.
"No act of ours could more fittingly continue the work of President Kennedy than the early passage of the tax bill for which he fought all this long year," he said, speaking to a joint session of Congress and a national television audience. A thunderous ovation followed.
Less than a month later, Martin, caricatured by the political cartoonist Herblock as a tightwad with a stiff, high collar, said the prospect of a tax cut was causing "excessive optimism."
"If the present euphoria should be translated by a tax cut in a real surge in the economy," he warned Fed policy makers on Dec. 17, "the system might be faced with the need for a change in the discount rate or some other drastic action to be taken at the first opportunity."
3.
By March 1964, Congress had passed the tax cut and the economy was cruising. In August, Guy Noyes, the Fed's chief economist, was nothing short of effusive. "It is hard to be critical of the recent performance of the economy," he said. "It has been little short of magnificent."
This rosy picture was disrupted by an event across the Atlantic.
Johnson: Hi, Bill.
Martin: Hello, Mr. President.
Johnson: How're ya.
Martin: Fine. I thought that, I had a little press conference ...
Johnson: Yup.
Martin: ... this afternoon on this action we took.
Martin's folksy banter belied a crisis that had demanded quick reflexes by the Fed. By a narrow margin, British voters elected the first Labour government in 15 years, and its ministers followed with a series of big spending plans to nationalize industries and expand social services. The prospect of inflation prompted currency traders to dump the British pound, forcing the Bank of England to raise its discount rate to 7 percent from 5 percent, a huge jump. To prevent those higher rates from drawing dollars away from the United States, the Fed raised its own rate, by one-half of 1 percentage point.
Martin: What I said to the press was this, that I wanted to make it clear that we would not have raised the discount rate at this time if it had not been for the British action, that we had been for some time watching the possibility of inflationary pressures developing or some problems with the balance of payments developing, but that you had indicated that you wanted us to stimulate the economy in every way that we could. ... We have not -- the Federal Reserve -- given them any advice or had they asked any advice. We had informed them of what we were doing, but we had taken our action entirely independently, and as an insurance premium on behalf of the American dollar.
Johnson: That's good.
Martin: I just wanted you to know. You know, you never can tell what the press will do with these things.
Johnson. Yup.
Johnson seemed to appreciate how Martin used a news conference to calm any distress in the markets, but he had one question: Would the rate increase tighten the money supply in the United States?
Johnson: You don't see in this any lack of availability of funds?
Martin: I don't see any at all. We're watching it very carefully in the exchange market, and the market behaved pretty well today -- of course, this was before our announcement this afternoon. But my guess is that we can handle it and we're going to try to increase, actually increase over the next 10 days, the availability of money through the reserve mechanism.
Johnson: That's wonderful, Bill. I hope you'll watch that and do everything you can. I'd hate for this to turn the other way on us.
4.
In Martin's eyes the situation was already turning, and in 1965 he began speaking publicly about his concerns. He was afraid the growing cost of the Vietnam War would force a devaluation of the dollar. He saw yet another budget deficit (there had been several in a row) at a time when budget deficits were still looked at askance. In a speech in May, he called it an era of "perpetual deficits and easy money" -- red flags among central bankers.
Then in June, at Columbia University, he laid down the gauntlet in a speech that described "disquieting similarities" between the current economic climate and the years leading to the Great Depression: "Then, as now, government officials, scholars and businessmen are convinced that a new economic era has opened, an era in which business fluctuations have become a thing of the past."
His words were heard. That afternoon the New York Stock Exchange had one of its sharpest declines since Kennedy's assassination, and the next day The New York Times reported on Page 1 that "Reserve Board Chief Compares Boom Today With That of 20's." Johnson, at his next news conference, went out of his way to dispel "gloom and doom" about the economy.
Behind the scenes Johnson was viscerally angry over Martin's remarks. According to Robert P. Bremner in his book "Chairman of the Fed," Johnson asked his attorney general, Nicholas Katzenbach, to determine if a president could legally remove a Fed board member from office. (He was advised that disagreeing with administration policies did not constitute "termination for cause.")
5.
In late November Martin signaled to Johnson's Treasury secretary that he thought he would have the votes for a rate increase at the Fed's Dec. 3 meeting. The secretary, Henry H. Fowler, relayed this news to Johnson, and they agreed that Martin should delay any action, at least until January, when the administration's budget estimates would be available.
Martin's behavior, Fowler said, was giving Americans the impression there were "two quarterbacks" running the economy -- Martin and Johnson.
Fowler: We ought to really try to hold him back now. One, because it's not the right way to operate -- it's just not right for him to go ahead without knowing what the cards are. Number two, it makes the country feel that we're divided, and it makes the country feel there are two quarterbacks down here -- one fellow's playing one game and one fellow's playing another. And as I told him the other day, the country is entitled to have the assurance that its economic and financial policies are being determined by a sensible group of reasonable men sitting around together.
On the morning of Friday, Dec. 3, the day of the Fed's policy-making meeting, Martin again called Fowler to tell him of the imminent rate increase. Johnson, at his Texas ranch recovering from gallbladder surgery, was livid that his calls for a delay were being ignored. Speaking to Fowler by phone, he made a historical reference going back nearly 150 years: the so-called Bank War when President Andrew Jackson whipped up a populist frenzy against Nicholas Biddle and his Bank of the United States, a predecessor of the Federal Reserve.
Johnson: I would hope that he wouldn't call his board together and have a Biddle-Jackson fight -- I'm prepared to be Jackson if he wants to be Biddle -- have a fight like that. Right now I don't want that in public.
Johnson made sure Fowler passed along his warning.
Johnson: It's going to hurt my pride, and it's going to hurt my leadership, and it's going to hurt the best champion business has got in this country.
His voice rising, he then told Fowler they needed to replace Martin with a "tough guy" to run the central bank.
Johnson: Then, Henry, you all got to think of -- around the clock, too, before you get sick -- as to where we can get a real articulate, able, tough guy that can take this Federal Reserve place.
Martin resisted the appeals. At the Board of Governors meeting that afternoon, he called for a vote to raise the discount rate a half-percentage point, to 4.5 percent. But before the vote, he conceded that raising the rate would essentially wave a red flag before the critics of an independent Federal Reserve, in Congress and in the White House. "We should be under no illusions," he told his colleagues. "A decision to move now can lead to an important revamping of the Federal Reserve System, including its structure and operating methods. This is a real possibility and I have been turning it over in my mind for months."
The vote was 4 to 3. Martin cast the deciding ballot.
In Texas, Johnson was enraged. Joseph Califano, an aide (later a cabinet secretary under President Jimmy Carter), recalled Johnson's "burning up the wires to Washington, asking one member of Congress after another, 'How can I run the country and the government if I have to read on a news-service ticker that Bill Martin is going to run his own economy?"'
Martin was summoned to explain why he had defied the president.
6.
Martin flew down to the Johnson Ranch on Monday, Dec. 6, along with Fowler and other advisers. The president met them at an airstrip behind the wheel of his Lincoln convertible. They piled in and he drove them to the house.
There, Johnson got Martin alone and did not mince words. According to different accounts, the 6-foot-4 Johnson pushed the shorter Martin up against a wall.
"You went ahead and did something that you knew I disapproved of, that can affect my entire term here," Johnson said, as Martin recalled later in an oral history. "You took advantage of me and I'm not going to forget it, because here I am, a sick man. You've got me into a position where you can run a rapier into me and you've run it."
"Martin, my boys are dying in Vietnam, and you won't print the money I need," he said.
Martin stood his ground. He pointed out that he had given the president fair warning that a raise was coming. More broadly, he insisted that he and the president had different jobs to do, that the Federal Reserve Act gave the Fed responsibility over interest rates.
"I knew you disapproved of it, but I had to call the shot as I saw it," he said.
The two eventually stepped outside and tried to assure reporters that any differences had been patched up. Their sour expressions, captured in newspapers the next day, suggested otherwise.
Despite their differences, Johnson renominated Martin to the Fed chairman's job one year later. Martin would step down in 1970 during the administration of Richard M. Nixon, the fifth president he served under, after having had the longest term of any Fed chief.
The economic expansion that started in 1961 would continue until nearly 1970 -- the second longest ever, a credit to Martin's stewardship. But many argue that he was too slow to raise the discount rate.
In fact, the increase in rates approved in December 1965 did little to control inflation, which would creep higher after the mid-1960s and become a defining issue in the next two decades. A successor, Paul A. Volcker, was forced to push interest rates to nearly 20 percent to bring prices down.
In the end, it appears Martin left the punch bowl out too long.

Full text: The prospect of good jobs at good pay has faded of late, and the government is only threatening to make things worse. Cutting taxes on the wealthy, especially by rescinding health insurance for millions, and deregulating Wall Street -- the centerpieces of the Trump agenda -- help those who need no help while depriving the government of resources that could help create well-paying jobs and bolster people's incomes. Such trickle-down economics encourages business polices that make the work force less secure.
At the same time, the Federal Reserve, apparently concluding that the economy is at or near "full employment," appears ready to cool it down with still higher interest rates. The thought is that the jobless rate, 4.3 percent, cannot go any lower without causing excessive inflation -- even though economic growth has been modest, job growth has slowed in recent months, and inflation remains below the Fed's 2 percent target.
The upshot is that both fiscal and monetary policy are moving in ways to inhibit wage growth when it is desperately needed.
Last year, the median hourly wage rose 3.1 percent as employers steadily added jobs throughout the economy. In recent months, though, as job growth has slowed, wage growth has fallen to an annual rate of about 2.5 percent. That's better than nothing, but unless wage gains are strong and sustained, workers will perpetually be making up for ground that has been lost over decades as wages have barely budged while executive pay and shareholder returns have soared. If wage gains reflected decades-long gains in labor productivity -- the measure of the economic growth created by workers -- an American making around $40,000 today would instead be making about $60,000.
A labor market in which wage growth is slowing still has room to grow, because when job conditions are truly tight, wages rise as employers compete for workers. A rate increase would continue to prop up stock prices but would hurt workers. Such an outcome would be impossible to square with the Fed's mandate to promote full employment and stable prices.
To raise wages, the government could raise the federal minimum wage (last increased in 2009) and modernize overtime pay rules for salaried workers (last updated fully in 1975). At the least, any tax cut should be focused on low- and moderate-wage earners by vastly increasing the earned-income tax credit, at far less cost than Mr. Trump's proposed high-end tax cut. If a family of four making $40,000 received a credit of $6,000 rather than $2,000, as under current law, the extra income would go a long way to repairing the damage from prolonged stretches in which wage earners have lost out while executives and investors have triumphed. It would also make sense for the federal government to tax and borrow to pay for infrastructure projects, which would create jobs in the near term while boosting the economy's productive potential; unfortunately, Mr. Trump's plan seems more intent on enriching private builders than benefiting the general public.
The White House and Congress show no sign of altering the path they are on, but the Fed has generally shown flexibility in the face of changing conditions. Pay raises for American workers depend on Republican leaders' changing their ways and on the Fed's reverting to form.

Full text: Blame the inexperienced director, Alex Kurtzman, for delivering a mess of a movie. Scratch that: Fault Universal for settling on a script that emphasized action over characters and campy fun. Actually, perhaps a baggage-laden Tom Cruise was the problem. Or was it the horror-based marketing campaign? All of the above?
Whatever the reasons -- some analysts also pointed to the continued strength of "Wonder Woman," which remained No. 1 in its second weekend, collecting about $57.2 million -- "The Mummy" arrived to just $32.2 million in North American ticket sales. That was a disappointing start for a film that cost hundreds of millions of dollars to make and market and was supposed to stir excitement for Universal's coming cavalcade of monster-movie remakes.
"The Mummy," to be followed by new versions of "The Bride of Frankenstein," "The Invisible Man" and "The Creature From the Black Lagoon," among others, received abysmal reviews. Ticket buyers were similarly underwhelmed, according to CinemaScore exit polls.
Overseas, where audiences (and the news media) mostly don't care as much about Mr. Cruise's past foibles and ties to Scientology, "The Mummy" did much better, taking in a sturdy $141.8 million, according to comScore. Universal said on Sunday that China generated $52.2 million in weekend ticket sales, a record for a movie starring Mr. Cruise.
Generally speaking, foreign ticket buyers are less sensitive to reviews. Analysts also say that overseas audiences, especially in countries where Hollywood has only recently made inroads, are less worn out by the continued revisiting of classic characters. (Universal's previous "Mummy" series concluded less than a decade ago. That series started in 1999, with a film that took in $64.6 million in the United States and Canada over its first three days, after adjusting for inflation.)
Still, North America remains the world's biggest movie market, and Universal now finds itself in a difficult position. The studio is counting on its planned Dark Universe of monster movies to compete at the box office (unlike Disney, Warner Bros., 20th Century Fox and Sony, Universal does not make superhero movies) and bolster its theme parks. But a re-evaluation of the monster initiative's creative direction may now be necessary.
Other studios have overcome similar challenges. Warner's efforts to build an interconnected superhero "universe," for instance, got off to a weak start. A shift in approach -- and executives -- resulted in "Wonder Woman," a runaway critical and commercial hit that has now taken in $435 million globally.
Misses for Universal are relatively rare. The studio, which will release "Despicable Me 3" on June 30, ranks second for the year in terms of domestic market share (behind Disney), driven by smashes like "The Fate of the Furious" and "Get Out."
In the most recent quarter, Universal had $368 million in operating profit, up from $167 million a year earlier.

Full text: LONDON -- Right about now, Eddie Stamton, a construction worker, would normally be making preparations to jet off to a sandy stretch of the Mediterranean for a summer holiday. Not this year. In the year since Britain's shocking vote to abandon the European Union, the British pound has surrendered 13 percent of its value against the euro, raising the cost of cherished European vacations. Food from other lands -- meat, cheese, wine -- is more expensive, too. So is gasoline.
Accelerating inflation may help explain the stunning electoral rebuke of Prime Minister Theresa May and her governing Conservative Party as well as the unexpected strengthening of the Labour Party in Thursday's parliamentary elections. Consumers are grappling with rising prices, and wages have not kept pace. The economy is weakening.
Mr. Stamton, 51, who lives in northeast London, has traditionally voted for the Conservatives, yet this time he gave his support to the U.K. Independence Party, the fringe party that has long advocated that Britain ditch Europe. Never mind that the consequences of that position, the falling pound, have yielded the indignity at hand -- trading the sun-splashed beaches of Greece for the shaded parks of south London.
"Travel is more expensive," Mr. Stamton said. "I'm just going to stay home."
Here is the economic backdrop for the tumultuous period of political uncertainty now unfolding. Mrs. May and her party have lost their governing majority just as Britain is set to negotiate terms in its tricky divorce with Europe -- "Brexit," as it is widely known. As the Conservatives try to hang on to control of the government, a weakening economy is likely to intensify the sense of grievance among ordinary Britons who have not gained the spoils from recent years of growth.
The economy expanded by only 0.2 percent over the first three months of the year compared to the previous quarter, far less than the 0.7 percent pace of growth seen at the end of 2016. It grew at an annualized pace of 2 percent during the quarter.
Consumer spending makes up nearly two-thirds of British economic activity, meaning the troubles of ordinary people can have decisive influence over the economy -- and politics, for that matter. For the average worker, rising prices for everyday consumer goods are landing atop a decade of stagnating wages.
Few economists expect that Britain will fall into a recession, but the consensus envisions disappointing economic growth ranging between 1.5 percent and 1.75 percent annually over this year and next.
Last year's Brexit referendum was in part a rejection of the economic elite from millions of working people who have suffered declining wages while watching London transformed into a carnival of wealth for globe-trotting financiers.
The prime minister called for the elections on the strength of polls showing her party capturing an expanded parliamentary majority, aiming to solidify her hand as she negotiates exit terms with Europe. But her miserable showing in Thursday's polls suggest that the same forces that produced Brexit have assailed the government that is supposed to execute it: Many Britons are dissatisfied with their economic lot.
In the dozen years since Vaidas Zelskis entered Britain from his native Lithuania to pursue work as a carpenter, his wages have grown from about 120 pounds a day (about $224 dollars at the exchange rates of the time) to about £180 now, or $233. But over the same time, his usual assortment of groceries have soared from some £50 per week to more like £120.
"The rich people can always afford what they want," Mr. Zelskis said as he took a cigarette break on a recent morning outside his current job at the Shard, an iconic skyscraper south of the River Thames. "But the middle class really feels it."
Much as in the United States, most working people in Britain have yet to fully recover from the traumatic financial crisis that began in 2008.
Britain's average weekly wages are lower today than they were a decade ago after accounting for inflation, noted Martin Beck, lead British economist at Oxford Economics in London. This, despite the fact that Britain's unemployment rate dropped to 4.6 percent in April, a level last seen in 1975.
"For most people, there hasn't been a real recovery for years," Mr. Beck said.
In years past, low unemployment has tended to push up wages, as employers found themselves forced to pay more to compete for a smaller pool of workers. Why this typically enriching dynamic has failed to emerge now is the subject of considerable debate among economists.
Unions are far weaker than years ago. The gig economy has replaced full-time jobs with part-time and temporary stints, diluting the power of workers to demand higher pay.
A surfeit of global uncertainties -- Brexit, President Trump's threats to dismantle institutions at the heart of the global order -- have perhaps made companies reluctant to add costs.
The weaker pound has given a boost to British exports, making them lower priced than European and American competitors. British whiskey, salmon and chocolate have been selling in increasing volumes.
But Britain imports more food than it exports. Many of the country's key export industries -- automotive, aerospace and medical devices -- draw on suppliers in Europe for components. Even as the weak pound makes the prices of their finished wares more competitive, it also raises their costs.
The economy also faces the loss of top-dollar banking jobs as London's status as a leading international financial center confronts the challenges posed by Brexit. Roughly one-third of the industry's business involves handling transactions for clients in Europe. Once Britain is out of the European Union, much of that business may be effectively illegal, requiring that banks satisfy the proclivities of regulators in the 27 remaining members of the bloc.
The financial industry has been lobbying the government to forge a deal with Europe that would maintain the status quo, enabling the money to keep flowing unimpeded. In weakening Mrs. May's stature, the election may have increased the chances she will soften her line and assent to compromises that would preserve Britain's inclusion in the European market.
Even so, global banks cannot afford to wait in the hopes that a useful deal will be struck. They are already drawing up plans to move jobs to cities elsewhere in the European Union as they seek to ensure that -- whatever comes -- they will be able to execute all trades. Britain could suffer losses of 15,000 to 80,000 jobs over the next two years, according to studies.
Investment continues to grow modestly, because major projects take years to plan and execute. But most economists assume it will slow as Brexit separates the Britain from the rest of the European marketplace, undermining the incentive for multinational companies to use Britain as a regional hub.
"As the outlines of Brexit negotiations begin to take shape, companies are going to be a lot more concerned," said Peter Dixon, a global financial economist at Commerzbank AG in London. "Even if companies don't slash investment, they are likely to postpone expansions."
For now, scrutiny focuses on the increasingly beleaguered British consumer.
Outstanding credit card balances across Britain were nearly 10 percent higher in April compared with a year earlier, the fastest pace of growth in more than a decade, the Bank of England disclosed. That stoked worries that consumers could soon exhaust their sources of cash as their paychecks are effectively diminished by inflation.
"People have been able to borrow to keep consumer spending growing faster than real incomes," said John Hawksworth, chief economist for PwC UK in London. "There's a question mark as to how much the consumer can keep the economy going on its own."
Jennifer Corbin, a 48-year-old mother of five who lives in Wembley, northwest London, already has an answer to that question: Her family is economizing, forgoing their annual summer trip to the Canary Islands, where sunshine is abundant.
"Food, housing, travel. Everything is more expensive now," she said at the beginning of a recent three-day weekend, as she and her family awaited a train to a coastal destination that was closer at hand -- Brighton Beach, at the southern reaches of England.
There, the forecast was for chilly rain, followed by chillier rain.

Full text: CARACAS, Venezuela -- Armando Cañizales left his viola at home that day. Eighteen and talented, he was a success story of Venezuela's state-run music program for the poor. But he decided it was time to join the street protests against the government that had supported his career.
As teenagers throwing rocks retreated from a line of soldiers, Mr. Cañizales moved forward alone. He said nothing as he advanced, arms outstretched, palms facing up.
Then the fatal shots rang out.
"When he fell, I didn't even know it was him," said William Hernández, 19, a friend and fellow musician a short distance from Mr. Cañizales during the protests last month. He never expected Mr. Cañizales, who had expressed no political views to him, to be at the march. The viola had seemed to be the only thing on his mind.
Venezuela's political unrest is testing the loyalties of many who have benefited from the socialist-oriented government -- and at times were its strongest defenders. Doctors and nurses at public hospitals hold marches to demand supplies for empty clinics. Police officers, themselves suffering shortages of food, now question the government's battle with protesters.
Yet no group has been tested quite like Venezuela's classical musicians, who for years have been drawn from the country's working-class barrios.
They belong to the Simón Bolívar Musical Foundation, known to Venezuelans simply as El Sistema, Spanish for "the System." For four decades, the state-financed program trained hundreds of thousands of musicians across social classes, an achievement unheard-of anywhere else in Latin America and one that has left the music world in envy.
El Sistema's youth orchestra toured the United States during years of tense relations between the countries.. Its young prodigy, Gustavo Dudamel, became an international star and now leads the Los Angeles Philharmonic. A source of national pride, the classical music program was one of the few institutions that seemed exempt from Venezuela's growing polarization, and was protected by successive governments in return.
"In its 42 years, El Sistema somehow managed to keep an impartial position," said Ollantay Velásquez, the director of Mr. Cañizales's orchestra. "It has stayed that way until today."
Yet the young man's death is rupturing that neutrality, underlining the kinds of dilemmas faced across Venezuela's institutions as street protests approach their third month, with at least 67 people dead in the turmoil.
From Los Angeles, Mr. Dudamel broke his silence about the protesters' demands, dedicating a concert in Mr. Cañizales's memory from the stage in May and issuing a fiery statement against the government's repression of demonstrators.
"We must stop ignoring the just cry of the people suffocated by an intolerable crisis," Mr. Dudamel warned. "I raise my voice against violence. I raise my voice against repression."
In Venezuela, orchestra members have played memorial concerts for Mr. Cañizales, using performances to denounce government officials as traitors. Other musicians say they are now following Mr. Cañizales's example in the streets as well, heading into the front lines of protests with their instruments in tow.
On a recent afternoon, Wuilly Arteaga, 23, stood in the center of a crowd of demonstrators, his violin on his shoulder. His case was strapped to his back, his helmet painted with the colors of the Venezuelan flag. He played the national anthem.
Explosions of tear gas canisters erupted between the notes he played. Finally, other protesters grabbed him by a shoulder and dragged him back from the security forces.
"I remembered my friend Armando," Mr. Arteaga said afterward. "I have spent ages now playing and living on the streets, and I see that so many talented Venezuelans have had to eat from the trash."
Anthony, another classical musician, now spends his days on the front lines of the clashes with security forces, dodging tear gas canisters and rubber bullets. Some of the instructors have told him not to go, he said.
"They've begged us not to become polarized, not to show our political stripes," said Anthony, who asked that his full name not be used because he feared reprisals. "Many of us go out concealed."
Like most teenagers, Mr. Cañizales grew up under former President Hugo Chávez and his leftist movement, which took power in Venezuela the year he was born.
Mr. Chávez, a populist buoyed by oil prices that skyrocketed after he came to power, used the money to reshape the country's political and economic order, expropriating foreign assets, building thousands of public housing units and schools, and directing profits from Venezuela's state oil company toward the poor.
El Sistema was founded long before Mr. Chávez's movement, in 1975, by José Antonio Abreu, a conductor working with an initial class of 11 students in a parking garage. But Mr. Chávez soon saw it as a driver of change in the country's poorest neighborhoods and a way to raise Venezuela's cultural profile abroad.
"Revolutionary Venezuela is aware of the infinite value of music as a bastion in the fight for equality and happiness," Mr. Chávez wrote in a 2011 letter to Mr. Abreu.
Around age 10, Mr. Cañizales took up the viola. Though he had planned to be a doctor one day, the instrument became an obsession for him -- no less than "his life," recalled Jesús Pérez, his El Sistema professor.
He loved Beethoven, said those who knew him. He practiced Georg Philipp Telemann, a Baroque composer whose Viola Concerto Mr. Cañizales once played in a recital, perhaps with a bit of stage fright, missing a few notes.
"He played for the love of it," said Mr. Velásquez, the orchestra conductor.
Mr. Chávez died in 2013, replaced by a handpicked but much less popular successor, Nicolás Maduro, who soon was saddled by falling oil prices. By 2015, basic foods, once imported by the government cheaply on oil dollars, had become scarce, demoralizing the country.
El Sistema was beginning to suffer as well.
Salaries of teachers were eroded by inflation, which reached triple digits. Basic maintenance of the main concert hall in the capital, Caracas, was neglected, and it suddenly flooded one night in 2016. Cascades of water dripped on the timpani drums stored there.
"Just to put strings on a viola became impossible," recalled Mr. Pérez, the teacher.
Yet Mr. Cañizales "was a boy of few words," Mr. Pérez said. The teenager kept his own counsel, and few said they had known he was considering joining the street protests when they began to erupt in late spring.
May 3 was a tumultuous day in Caracas. An armored vehicle drove into a crowd of protesters who attacked it. Four opposition lawmakers were wounded in clashes. Even the leftist attorney general came out that day to condemn the police repression as excessive.
In another part of the city, young protesters were throwing rocks at a long line of national guardsmen. In a video clip, recorded by a Venezuelan journalist for an online news site, a lone figure wearing a backpack and a helmet appears, approaching the guardsmen from a distance with his arms outstretched. The man is Mr. Cañizales.
There is no record of the shooting. The next clip recorded by the journalist, Luis Olavarrieta, shows the young musician being rushed into an ambulance.
"No, Armando, no!" someone screams.
Mr. Pérez, his viola teacher, learned of the news when he saw his student's name suddenly appear on Twitter that day.
"I couldn't imagine it," he said. "I saw 'Trending Topic, Armando Cañizales,' and I said to my wife, 'What was Armando doing there?"'
Mr. Velásquez, the orchestra conductor, was himself out protesting that day when he got a call. "They asked me if the boy was in my orchestra," he said. "I felt impotent, like I had lost my son."
In the weeks since, the government and its rivals have pointed fingers at each other for Mr. Cañizales's death, with opposition members blaming security forces. The government has suggested that a stray bullet from a protester was the cause.
Mr. Olavarrieta, the journalist, said the shots had come from the side of the national guardsmen.
"The discharge came from in front of him, and there was no one else there" besides government forces, he said.
Hundreds turned out for Mr. Cañizales's funeral in May. Members of his orchestra set up their music stands in the cemetery to play. Someone held a Venezuelan flag.
Mr. Cañizales's mother, Mónica Carrillo, went up to the teacher, Mr. Pérez, and handed him her son's viola.
"I can't describe what I felt when I opened the case and took Armando's viola into my hands," he said. "There was a pressure on my chest so strong, I just wanted to cry, it was so terrible."
He added: "His mother said, 'I want that Armando's viola gets played today."'

Full text: HOUSTON -- Looking for an excuse to pack up the car for a road trip this weekend? Look no further: The average nationwide gasoline price on Friday was the lowest for this point of the year since 2005, according to GasBuddy, a website and smartphone app designed to help drivers find the best deals at the pump.
The immediate cause of the price break was the shock to global oil markets that came when the Energy Department reported this week that domestic inventories of both crude oil and gasoline had surprisingly surged the week before despite heavy driving on the Memorial Day weekend.
Crude oil prices plummeted by more than 5 percent on Wednesday alone, and are near a one-year low at less than $46 a barrel.
The price drop has been all the more remarkable given that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has imposed a production cut since the start of the year, and Saudi Arabia and its allies cut off relations with Qatar this week, threatening the kind of heightened tensions in the Middle East that normally push energy prices higher.
But whatever lies behind the dividend at the pump, drivers are happy to have it. The national average price for a gallon of regular gasoline tumbled to $2.35 on Friday, a drop of 3 cents in the past week and more than 2 cents below last year at this time, according to AAA. And Friday was the first time this year that prices were lower than a year earlier.
Among the beneficiaries was Charlene Kotlarsic of Garfield Heights, Ohio, who was filling up her 2016 Kia Sorento in the Cleveland suburbs for $2.21 a gallon. She expects to take advantage of the lower prices for a road trip to Myrtle Beach, S.C., in July. "I probably wouldn't have planned it if gas prices were $3 and above," she said.
Ohio drivers are among those most likely to notice the impact. Of the 23 states where prices are lower than a year ago, a cluster of states -- Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan and Wisconsin -- are seeing the biggest declines. Indiana drivers are paying 28 cents a gallon less on average than last year, meaning a driver can save around $5 in filling up a midsize car.
Most energy experts say the break in gasoline prices may last only a few weeks, because stronger seasonal demand will soon draw down refinery storage levels. And if oil prices stay low, that would depress new production, which could eventually push prices higher.
"Drivers should be very happy because all prognosticators overestimated what they would be paying," said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis for the Oil Price Information Service. "This is a slump, a buying opportunity, and Americans can enjoy it. But I think it is a little bit of an anomaly, and I expect to see higher crude oil prices in the second half of the year."
The recent lows become more stark in comparison to mid-2008, when the American oil benchmark hit $145 a barrel and the average price of gasoline hit a record of $4.11 a gallon, according to AAA. Economists credit the slide with helping to keep inflation and interest rates low, and benefiting low-income consumers who spend the most money on energy relative to their incomes.
Tom Sech, a real estate agent from Independence, Ohio, who drives a nine-year-old compact sport-utility vehicle, likes to make trips to his lakeside cottage in Chautauqua, N.Y. "I can go more often because gas is cheaper," he said.
Americans consume roughly 400 million gallons of gasoline a day, so every penny decline means around $4 million a day to American consumers.
Prices at the pump are determined by a variety of factors, including consumer demand, domestic storage levels and OPEC production decisions. And there are great regional variations, reflecting differences in refinery operations as well as state taxes.
The average driver in South Carolina could fill up for $2.02 a gallon on Friday, compared with $3.06 in California and Hawaii, according to AAA. The Western states are seeing the biggest increases from last year, because of rising demand by drivers and unplanned maintenance of local refineries. Drivers in New Jersey are paying 23 cents a gallon more than a year ago because of an increase in gasoline taxes.
There was strong American consumption growth in 2015 and 2016, due in large part to the collapse of oil and gasoline prices. But with winter oil and gasoline prices considerably higher this year than last, motorists drove a bit less and domestic oil companies ramped up production to take advantage of higher crude prices. That produced a glut, with refineries able to pull stocks from storage rather than buy more expensive, new crude.
American oil production, after a two-year slump, is soaring again, with the active drilling rig count more than doubling since May 2016. The Energy Department recently predicted that domestic oil production, which averaged 8.6 million barrels a day in 2016, will average 9.3 million barrels a day this year and 10 million barrels a day in 2018, blowing past the record set in 1970. The bulk of the new production is coming from the shale fields of Texas.
"It's an unbelievable ramp-up considering that the price of a barrel of oil has not increased significantly," said Matthew Hale, chief executive of S.O.C. Industries, a pump truck and production chemical services company that operates in the West Texas oil fields. "The activity level has really boomed, and with technological advances, the increase in the number of barrels we're getting out of each well is pretty amazing to watch."
The expanded United States production has canceled out much of the reduction in OPEC output, now more a million barrels a day below last year. While Russia and some other producers besides OPEC have also cut production, Brazil and Canada are among those producing more. Nevertheless, the Energy Department is predicting that global oil inventories will fall in the second half of the year.
The Energy Department recently forecast an average regular gasoline retail price of $2.46 a gallon during this summer driving season, 23 cents higher than last summer. But experts say predictions are unreliable, given that demand from China and other developing countries frequently varies because of changing economic and political circumstances. Also, Venezuela, a top source of imported oil, might collapse at any time, and hurricanes can suddenly shut down Gulf refineries.
In short, don't get used to filling the tank for less. Or take advantage while you can.
"Forecasting the price of gasoline is an art form, not a science," said Larry Goldstein, a director at the Energy Policy Research Foundation, which studies energy economics. "There are simply too many variables. The best you could hope for is a range of plus or minus 10 cents a gallon."

Full text: With the Tony Awards coming on Sunday night, I decided this week that I'd better bite the bullet and buy tickets to "Hello, Dolly!" in case Bette Midler wins best actress and tickets become even more scarce and expensive. I knew the tickets would be steep. Thanks to what's known as dynamic pricing, in which costs shift constantly to match demand, top ticket prices for hit shows on Broadway have hit previously unheard-of levels. Annual Broadway ticket sales reached a record $1.45 billion for the just-ended season.
Last month The Times reported that the top box-office price for "Hello, Dolly!" was $748. For the phenomenon "Hamilton," it was $849.
When I went online Wednesday, the top price for that night's performance of "Hello, Dolly!" at several ticket resellers was $1,450, give or take a few dollars. (It was sold out both on Telecharge and at the Shubert Theater box office.)
As premium ticket prices have soared, many buyers have responded with outrage, accusing theater owners of price gouging and bemoaning the emergence of Broadway as one more exclusive preserve for the ultrarich. Both themes were prominent in reader comments on the Times article.
But guess what? There was also one "Hello, Dolly!" ticket for $194 on Wednesday evening available from an online reseller, albeit for a balcony seat. And there were more than a dozen seats at prices well below $750.
And if you're willing to forgo the potentially once-in-a-lifetime experience of seeing Bette Midler as Dolly Levi, TodayTix, a relatively new purveyor, was offering seats for future performances starring the critically lauded Donna Murphy -- for $39.
The venerable TKTS booth in Times Square had 22 Broadway shows on offer for Wednesday evening, nearly all at 50 percent off.
"People have been whipped into a frenzy by the top prices," said Thomas Schumacher, president of the Disney Theatrical Group, producer of the current, dynamically priced hit musicals "The Lion King" and "Aladdin." "If you're a regular person who wants to see a Broadway show tonight, you can. There are tickets for $29. You may be priced out of the best seats at the hottest shows, but the same is true of a deluxe suite at the St. Regis or a restaurant on New Year's Day."
Even at hit shows, relatively few seats sell at headline-making prices. Mr. Schumacher noted that the average price of a ticket for "Aladdin," one of the five top-grossing shows on Broadway, was $112 last year.
Average Broadway ticket prices last season rose to $109 from the prior season's $103, a 5.8 percent increase. That's more than the rate of inflation but still not exorbitant considering the disproportionate impact of a few megahits like "Hamilton." (The higher prices compensated for -- or perhaps contributed to -- a decline in the number of tickets sold.)
As more transactions shift to the internet, consumers will have to get used to a world in which dynamic pricing is increasingly the norm. They've pretty much accepted it for airline fares; airlines pioneered the concept years ago. It has since spread to hotel rooms, sporting events, concerts and designer clothing -- and is likely to be used for just about any highly differentiated product where demand may at times far exceed supply.
"At the most basic level, all pricing is about allocating scarce resources," said Robert Phillips, the head of marketplace optimization sciences at Uber, the car service that has pioneered surge pricing in local transportation. Surge pricing is another form of dynamic pricing. (Mr. Phillips previously headed Columbia University's Center for Pricing and Revenue Management.)
"I've worked in theater, concerts and sports," he said, "and they all have a similar problem: For extreme hits, demand at what people would consider a reasonable price far exceeds supply."
From an economics perspective, "this is simply a rationing problem," he added. "If you keep prices low, people will buy tickets and resell them on the secondary market. Someone is going to pay a market-clearing price, no matter how high. The only question is who should get the money: the investors and performers and creators, or a speculator who managed to snap up the tickets the moment the box office opened?"
However creative the product, says Howard Sherman, director of the Arts Integrity Initiative for the New School College of Performing Arts, Broadway is not immune from the forces of any marketplace.
"As somebody who believes theater and live performing arts are an incredibly important part of our society, I'd love to be able to say that ticket prices should stay artificially low," said Mr. Sherman, who is also a United States theater columnist for the British weekly The Stage. "But that denies the reality of what commercial theater is. Shows have a responsibility to return money to the people who invested in them and to the people who created the show."
The Harvard economist N. Gregory Mankiw paid $2,500 apiece last fall for prime tickets to "Hamilton," which he bought two weeks before the performance via StubHub. As he put it in a subsequent column in The Times, "In a perfect world, everyone would have the opportunity to see a megahit like 'Hamilton."'
But "it was only because the price was so high that I was able to buy tickets at all on such short notice," he added. "If legal restrictions or moral sanctions had forced prices to remain close to face value, it is likely that no tickets would have been available by the time my family got around to planning its trip to the city."
When I reached him this week, Mr. Mankiw said he thought the backlash to high theater prices reflected a broader anticapitalist bias. "People say they believe in capitalism, but when prices rise to clear markets, they say it's unfair," he said. "I have some sympathy for that when you're talking about fundamental rights, like perhaps health care. But scarce tickets to 'Hamilton'?"
I asked him if "Hamilton" tickets had been worth the cost. "Every penny," Mr. Mankiw said. "It was fantastic, one of the best things I've ever seen."
Just as smart travelers know how to find bargain airline seats, there are some simple ways ticket buyers can use dynamic pricing to their advantage, since it yields bargains along with premium prices. Weekday shows, and especially Wednesday matinees, are generally in far less demand than weekend shows. January and September are the best months for cheap seats. Prices are usually lower before a show officially opens and critics weigh in (as long as the reviews are positive).
Waiting until the last minute often pays off for everything but the biggest hits, since lost revenue from an empty seat can never be recouped. Theaters often offer last-minute cut-rate tickets at the TKTS booths, and online resellers start to slash prices. (Ticket buyers can monitor in real time what's available at the TKTS website.)
And as I discovered, it helps to be flexible. While I started out this week looking for "Hello, Dolly!" tickets, I ended up at "Groundhog Day," a new show with seven Tony nominations, including best musical and best actor, for a small fraction of the price of seeing Bette Midler. Seats for "Groundhog Day" were available at TKTS for half-price and online for $50. (And I loved it.)
Dynamic pricing and super-premium prices may be relatively new, but the scarcity of tickets for hit shows has a long tradition. Mr. Schumacher cited "My Fair Lady," the "Hamilton" of the 1955-56 Broadway season. As Broadway lore has it, a man in the audience turned to his neighbor, an older woman, and asked why the fifth-row center seat next to her was empty.
"My husband died," she replied.
"Didn't anyone else want to come?" he asked.
"No," she answered. "They're all at the funeral."

Full text: Facebook. Amazon. Apple. Netflix. Google. Not only do they dominate our daily lives, but as their stocks continue to soar, these technology giants may also dictate our financial futures.
In the last three years, their share prices have risen far faster than the major market indexes -- Amazon leads the way, up 206 percent; Apple trails the pack with a 67 percent gain -- as investors of virtually every stripe have piled into these companies.
But this gold-rush mentality, reminiscent of investor frenzies for Nifty 50 stocks in the late 1970s and the dot-com boom and bust at the end of the last century, is giving investors pause. Not because they think these companies will crack, as many did in previous market corrections, but because in the parlance of the industry, the trade has become very crowded.
"There is valuation anxiety out there, that is for sure," said Ed Yardeni, an independent investment strategist who often highlights the influence of these stocks in his research notes. "No one is feeling totally comfortable holding stocks that are this expensive."
Despite some nervousness that a bubble might be building, stock indexes remain near recent record highs, without adjustment for inflation. On Wednesday, stocks ended slightly higher in cautious trading on the eve of several potentially market-moving events on Thursday, including the British election and testimony from James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed up 0.16 percent on Wednesday, led by gains in bank stocks.
Other markets have been robust recently, including those for gold, a traditional haven, and the virtual currency Bitcoin. But oil prices and the United States dollar have weakened, with the Bloomberg dollar spot index at its lowest levels since the Nov. 8 election.
The stock market, however, remains the main attraction.
Late in any bull market, investing in highflying momentum stocks requires balancing greed and fear. Everyone wants to keep making money, but everyone also lives in fear that the party will suddenly end.
According to the data provider FactSet, since 2012, mutual fund, pension fund and hedge fund holdings of stock in the five technology giants have more than doubled, to $1.4 trillion, from $558 billion -- a consequence of investors' buying up stocks that are rapidly increasing in value.
As is its wont, Wall Street has given voice to this unease with a nickname: Faang, an acronym for the five stocks that evokes a gruesome end more than it does the exuberance of the moment.
The push into these stocks has been driven by retail investors via traditional mutual funds, exchange-traded funds and direct ownership.
Through these channels, retail investors now own 60 to 70 percent of these stocks -- an exposure of very large amounts of money to a small selection of stocks that investment specialists say is unprecedented.
It is also dangerous because a prolonged bout of selling in such a small number of stocks could spur a wider sell-off in the market.
"In terms of magnitude, we have not seen this," said Jim Paulsen, an independent stock market strategist.
In Mr. Paulsen's view, a long period of subpar economic growth since 2009 has given the Faang stocks their special aura. Most companies have struggled to show consistent earnings and sales growth over this period.
So when Facebook's net earnings leap to $10 billion, from $1.4 billion, in four years or Amazon's sales jump to $135 billion, from $74 billion, investors take notice.
"You have this small cadre of companies that are showing extraordinary growth in a very sluggish economy," Mr. Paulsen said. "So yes, you can see how valuations would get extended."
Stock market historians say it would be unfair to compare today's technology companies to the more speculative names that characterized the dot-com boom and bust. Progress can easily be measured via earnings and the cash-generating abilities these companies have, as opposed to counting eyeballs on the web, which was the norm in that era.
Still, the question remains: How much more can the stock market valuations of these companies grow relative to the earnings they produce?
For example, the current stock market size of the Faang companies is $2.4 trillion, or about 13 percent of the size of the United States economy. By comparison, their combined earnings were just $77 billion last year -- with more than half that amount from Apple, the world's richest company.
Of course, in many cases, investors are calculating that in the long term, earnings growth will catch up with sales expansion as well as heavy investment spending aimed at putting competitors out of business.
Amazon, whose $2.3 billion in earnings last year supports a market capitalization of $483 billion, is the most profound example in this regard.
Still, it is not today's earnings that investors are betting on, but tomorrow's, the argument goes.
Surprisingly, some of the most passionate advocates for these companies are value investors. These investment professionals have earned reputations for snapping up companies trading at deep discounts relative to the market, not chasing stocks that fly high above it.
Bill Nygren, a value investor for more than 30 years, oversees the $5.8 billion Oakmark Select Fund, and his No. 1 holding in the fund is now Google's parent, Alphabet.
Mr. Nygren contends that the company is trading at a bargain to the market, as opposed to a premium, if Google's cash pile and the potential of YouTube to make a lot of money in the future are considered.
"I have not heard anyone advance the argument that the Google search engine is not even an average business," Mr. Nygren said. "Yet that is how the market is pricing it."
Another well-known value manager who is betting big on Faang stocks is Chris Davis, the lead stock picker for the $11.8 billion New York Venture Fund, where Amazon is his top position.
While skeptics see just $2 billion in earnings, he and his analysts see a company that has generated more than $15 billion in cash and is ready for a higher market rating because of the profitability of its web services division.
"Amazon is more fully valued than when we bought it," Mr. Davis said. "But we have never seen a company with such competitive advantages."
As these stock prices continue to rise, analysts agree that investors have little choice but to stick to their guns.
That is because the Faang stocks have become such large components of the major stock market measures. For a manager not to match the share of an Apple or an Amazon in a benchmark would result in an actively managed fund trailing its index and its peers.
And as investors pour billions of dollars into exchange-traded funds -- a record $314 billion in the last year -- no active manager can afford to lag the competition for too long.
So be it a mutual fund, hedge fund, sovereign wealth fund or family office, the strategy has been consistent -- put aside any fears, and stay invested.
"It's like you are riding a missile that you know could explode at any moment beneath you," said Julian Brigden of Macro Intelligence 2 Partners, an independent research company based in Vail, Colo. He has warned in his reports that some of these stocks have entered a stage of mania. "But," he said, "you have no choice but to be sucked into the trade."

Full text: With an important source of revenue down and the flow of customers flattening out, one of the biggest businesses in Georgia -- its public university system -- is turning to a strategy of consolidations and mergers to improve efficiency and cut costs. The system has shrunk from 35 campuses to 28, helping compensate for a nearly 20 percent cut in state funding from 2008 to 2016 and an enrollment that this spring rose only two-tenths of a percent over last year's spring semester. More consolidations are underway, reducing four of the remaining campuses to two.
The universities are putting some of the resulting $24 million in savings into efforts to reduce the number of dropouts. That beefs up the bottom line, too: It's cheaper to help a student stay in school than to recruit a new one.
Dramatic changes like these are essential, Chancellor Steve Wrigley told his Board of Regents in April. "We inherited a system largely conceived in the 1960s," Mr. Wrigley said. "But times, society and students have all changed dramatically."
That is not only true in Georgia. Other colleges and universities across the country are also responding (albeit sometimes slowly) to challenges threatening their traditional role in society if not their survival.
Because of a dip in the number of 18- to 24-year-olds, among other reasons, for example, enrollment has been dropping for five years, meaning that there are about 300,000 fewer undergraduates to divvy up among America's campuses than there used to be.
Changes to immigration policies, and resulting resentments, threaten the crucial supply of international students, which the consulting firm DrEducation predicts could cost universities in the United States a quarter of a billion dollars in the coming academic year.
To fill seats, colleges are engaged in an arms race of discounts that they increasingly cannot afford -- discounts so deep that, while their sticker prices appear to be rising ahead of the inflation rate, the schools are actually seeing their net tuition revenue decline. Many small, private nonprofit colleges are giving away a record 51 percent of their tuition income in the form of discounts, according to new figures from the National Association of College and University Business Officers.
While public funding for higher education is rising again in some states, it is still an inflation-adjusted $9 billion behind where it was before deep cuts were imposed during the last recession, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities reported.
One reason is that many states face large pension obligations for public employees, including those who work at universities; for some universities, the impact is becoming more immediate, as states shift this burden directly onto them. More than half of the $4.1 billion allocated for state universities and colleges in Illinois, for instance, now goes not to teaching or research, but to pay retirement costs, the Illinois Policy Institute says.
"There's always been a kind of a wishful thinking that when the economy gets back to normal, things will get better. And that is not happening anymore," said James A. Hyatt, associate director of the Center for Studies in Higher Education and former vice chancellor for budget and finance at the University of California, Berkeley.
On top of that, public universities face political pressure to keep tuition flat. And the Moody's bond-rating agency calculates that long-term returns from private university endowments are falling far short of what they need. A Department of Education list of financially troubled institutions now has more than 500 universities and colleges.
All of these pressures mean something has to give, and that includes upkeep. Colleges and universities face a combined shortfall of $30 billion for needed repairs and renovations, according to the APPA, formerly the Association of Physical Plant Administrators.
But in another bid to attract students, they keep building more, spending $11.6 billion last year on new construction, the private firm Dodge Data and Analytics says. That is adding not only more space the universities will have to maintain, but billions of dollars in debt on which someone will have to pay the interest.
Meanwhile, universities' monopoly on credentials is being threatened by alternative forms of education like software coding academies. Some employers are rethinking whether going to college is even necessary: 14 percent of hires at Google have no college degree, according to the company's senior human-resources officer. Nearly half of Americans surveyed last year by Public Agenda -- a nonpartisan policy organization that focuses on education and other topics -- said a higher education is no longer necessarily a good investment. And about the same proportion of graduates in a Gallup poll released last year said they were less than certain their degrees were worth the money.
"There's a fundamental lack of understanding about the strains that higher education is under," said Susan Fitzgerald, who tracks them as a senior vice president at Moody's.
James Soto Antony, a professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Education who focuses on education leadership, said that people imagine that all universities look like the one where he works. "They see this $36 billion endowment and the manicured lawns and they impute that onto all colleges and universities," Mr. Antony said. "And most of them are not like that. They are dramatically struggling for enrollment."
Fifty-eight percent of colleges and universities surveyed by the business officers association said their number of students has declined. The problem is worst for small private, nonprofit and second-tier public institutions in the Midwest and Northeast, where the college-age population has fallen fastest. The slide is projected by the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education to continue through at least 2023.
This has sped up the practice of offering discounts to fill seats. "I don't think universities have a choice not to," said Luke Behaunek, dean of students at Simpson College in Indianola, Iowa. He presented a sobering paper about the trend in April at the American Educational Research Association's annual meeting. "The discount rate is a symptom of the larger things they're facing," Mr. Behaunek said. "The margins these institutions are operating at are much thinner than the public understands."
Here's how thin: Thanks to rising discounts, small colleges reported an average revenue increase per freshman of just two-tenths of a percent last year, which means they lost ground when inflation is accounted for.
Ken Redd, director of research and policy analysis at the business officers association, said: "Are there enough students out there? Is there enough money out there in a time of declining enrollment to support all of those schools. Based on what we see now, you'd have to say the answer is no."
Chief business officers on campuses agree with him. More than four in 10 don't think their current financing models are sustainable. "Hearing that from the chief business officers is very telling," Mr. Redd said.
One solution they've tried: building or renovating space in the hope of luring students, especially high-income ones. But many smaller institutions that borrowed money to do this have smaller enrollments now than they did then, meaning more debt and less tuition revenue to pay it back, according to the higher-education construction consulting firm Sightlines. This even as their existing buildings need a collective billions of dollars worth of long-postponed repairs, the company says.
So universities and colleges are getting serious about other kinds of reforms. Some, as in Georgia, are dramatic -- and controversial. Several campus mergers there were announced only days before they were voted on by the Board of Regents, without enough notice for the public to sign up to comment. A similar proposal was put on the table in April by the Connecticut State Colleges and Universities (which does not include the University of Connecticut) in the wake of an enrollment drop and state budget cuts, only to be protested by faculty and students.
"Change is not easy, particularly when you've got institutions that have been around for 100 years" said Charlie Sutlive, vice chancellor for communications and governmental affairs at the University System of Georgia.
Some of this change is being pushed from the outside. Several higher education associations, with money from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, have set up a group of 31 colleges, universities and systems called the Frontier Set to exchange ideas that have worked to lower costs and improve success rates -- mostly around improving student retention, including through technology, which saves institutions money.
That "is tied as directly as possible to institutional financial health," said George L. Mehaffy, vice president for academic leadership and change at the American Association of State Colleges and Universities, which is involved in the project. "If you increase the number of students you retain and graduate, it dramatically affects your bottom line."
He cites one program pioneered at Georgia State University that gives "microgrants" from a few hundred dollars to $2,000 to help financially struggling students overcome setbacks that often derail their educations. It costs the university $2 million, but more than pays for itself by avoiding the even higher price tag of replacing dropouts. (Retention rates nationally have edged up by two percentage points since 2009 as colleges and universities invest more resources in student support.)
"We know what works," said Travis Reindl, senior communications officer at the Gates Foundation, "and we know there is a core set of diverse institutions with pockets of solutions and innovations going on, but they've never been brought together like this."
Another such consortium, the University Innovation Alliance, ties together 11 public research universities that share ways to cut costs and raise productivity.
Other universities and colleges in places where there are a lot of them -- Boston's Fenway neighborhood, for instance, and southwest Atlanta -- share administrative services, campus security, shuttle buses and even libraries, and are expanding offerings at a lower cost by doing it jointly or allowing cross registration. More such strategic alliances like these are likely in response to the "competitive and financial sustainability challenges" of higher education, a new report from the TIAA-CREF Institute says.
Even the organization that represents boards of trustees, the Association of Governing Boards of Universities and Colleges, has spun off a new division called AGB Institutional Strategies to help colleges come up with new forms of revenue, and The Guardians Initiative to encourage those trustees -- often successful private-sector business executives -- to bring new ideas into their university boardrooms.
Richard D. Legon, president of the association, said that fixing higher education "requires a collaborative partnership that benefits from some of the creativity and ingenuity board members bring to the table, working with institutional leadership to ensure that students, who are really in a customer mode, want to shop at your place."
Not everyone is doing this work. "There are some colleges that are very realistic about the challenges they're facing," said Ms. Fitzgerald of Moody's. "There are others that still have their heads in the sand and think that things are going to get better."
But the activity that is underway represents "a sea change," Mr. Mehaffy said. "There was an era when institutions sort of just moved on. The funds were relatively good, the students were standing in line. And today's environment is dramatically different. It is a time of enormous strains, but the good news is that it's a moment of growing action."

Full text: Here's a look at what's coming up this week. TECHNOLOGY
Apple is expected to debut a voice-controlled speaker.
On Monday, Apple will show off its latest software and hardware, including Macs and iPads, at its annual conference for developers. The most anticipated item is a new voice-controlled speaker that would compete with the Amazon Echo and Google Home devices. Vindu Goel
INVESTING
Annual auction starts for lunch with Warren Buffett.
Fans of Warren E. Buffett -- at least those with deep pockets -- have another chance to buy the billionaire lunch. An auction for a meal with Mr. Buffett, the chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway, at Smith & Wollensky in New York City began Sunday evening and runs through Friday, with bids starting at $25,000. (Last year's winner paid nearly $3.5 million.) The entire bid will support Glide, a nonprofit group that runs antipoverty programs in San Francisco. Michael J. de la Merced
MEDIA
ABC heads to trial over 'pink slime' reporting.
Beginning Monday, ABC will defend itself in a defamation case over its reports on a processed meat product called "pink slime." Beef Products Inc., based in Dakota Dunes, S.D., sued the network in 2012, saying its reporting misled consumers about the product's safety, leading to social media outrage and the removal of the item from grocery stores, fast-food restaurants and school cafeterias. The company said that the product was safe, and that the backlash had caused it to close three of its plants and lay off about 700 workers. ABC stands by its reporting. Daniel Victor
CLIMATE
Global energy and business leaders will convene in Beijing.
Less than a week after President Trump announced that he would pull the United States out of the Paris climate accord, energy ministers from around the world will gather Tuesday through Thursday in Beijing to discuss clean-energy investments and technologies. Energy Secretary Rick Perry, who campaigned unsuccessfully for the presidency on a pledge to eliminate three government departments including the Energy Department, will represent the United States. The gathering will include delegations from two dozen countries and the European Union, which together account for three-quarters of the world's emissions of greenhouse gases and 90 percent of the world's clean-energy investments. Executives from many companies that see opportunities in renewable energy or energy conservation will also attend the conference. Keith Bradsher
AUTO INDUSTRY
G.M. will update shareholders on an investor's proposal to lift stock prices.
Results of a fight between General Motors and a dissident investor will be announced Tuesday at the automaker's annual shareholders' meeting in Detroit. The firm, Greenlight Capital, which holds a 3.6 percent stake in G.M., has proposed to shareholders that they replace three of the company's directors as part of a larger effort to lift its sagging stock price. The company's board and chief executive, Mary T. Barra, have opposed Greenlight's proposal, which centers on the creation of two classes of stock aimed at unlocking more value for investors. Bill Vlasic
ECONOMY
Britain prepares to head to the polls.
British voters will go to the polls on Thursday to elect a new government. Though the campaign has concentrated mostly on domestic issues -- including the cost of care for older people and the provision of health services -- one factor looms large: Britain's exit from the European Union, known as "Brexit." How will the next government negotiate the move, and what will the country's economy look like? Prashant Rao
The European Central Bank may indicate the future of its economic stimulus.
Unexpectedly strong growth in the eurozone could prompt the European Central Bank, which will meet on Thursday in Tallinn, Estonia, to give a firmer indication of when it will begin withdrawing its economic stimulus. Mario Draghi, the president of the central bank, will hold a news conference after the meeting and is likely to offer a slightly more upbeat assessment of the eurozone economy. But inflation remains low, and some countries like Italy are still struggling, so Mr. Draghi is expected to remain reluctant to signal any major changes in course. Jack Ewing
TECHNOLOGY
Yahoo shareholders are expected to approve a sale to Verizon.
Yahoo shareholders will vote Thursday on the sale of the company's internet businesses to Verizon Communications for about $4.5 billion. The transaction, which will almost certainly be approved, would leave stockholders with shares in a new company that would primarily hold $57 billion in stock of Alibaba Group and Yahoo Japan. Vindu Goel
FINANCE
An Obama-era fiduciary rule will take effect.
Starting on Friday, financial advisers will be required to put their customers' interests ahead of their own when providing advice about their retirement money. The so-called fiduciary rule, created under the Obama administration, was called into doubt when President Trump signed an executive order calling for its review, which caused regulators to delay it. But late last month, Alexander Acosta, the Labor Department secretary, said the basic principles of the rule would indeed take effect on Friday, even as his agency continues to examine its finer details. The consumer protection rule isn't scheduled to be fully effective until Jan. 1, 2018. Tara Siegel Bernard

Full text: Now we know: President Trump has said he will pull the United States out of the Paris climate accord. So what's next?
In the absence of American leadership, China may move to fill the void.
The leaders of other nations united to criticize Mr. Trump's decision.
And President Emmanuel Macron of France extended an offer to Americans: "To all scientists, engineers, entrepreneurs, responsible citizens who were disappointed by the decision of the president of the United States, I want to say that they will find in France a second home."
Back in the United States, cities, states and companies pledged to meet the United States' greenhouse gas emissions targets under the Paris accord. The unnamed group so far includes three governors, 30 mayors, more than 80 university presidents and more than 100 businesses.
Corporate leaders in the United States expressed their disappointment:
Lloyd C. Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, who had never used Twitter before, used his first tweet to say that Mr. Trump's decision was a "setback for the environment and for the U.S.'s leadership position in the world."
Two chief executives who sat on Mr. Trump's economic advisory council -- Elon Musk of Tesla and Robert A. Iger of Disney -- said they would leave the group.
But many executives don't expect there to be an immediate impact on their company's investments and strategies, The Wall Street Journal reports.
And Wall Street itself didn't seem too worried, with stock markets extending gains after the announcement, The Financial Times reports.
Blue Apron Files for I.P.O.
Blue Apron, the food-kit delivery start-up, has made the move to go public.
The size of the initial public offering has yet to be determined, but the prospectus listed a fund-raising target of $100 million, a preliminary number used to determine filing fees.
The key figures in the filing show that sales at the five-year-old company rose tenfold from 2014 to 2016, while losses and marketing costs rose.
Blue Apron also said that it would have three classes of shares, allowing management to maintain control more easily:
Class A: These will be sold to the public and will carry one vote per share.
Class B: The founders and early investors own these shares, which carry 10 votes per share.
Class C: These have no voting rights and will be used for purposes like acquisitions.
Texas Grants Relief to Cities With Pension Woes
Dallas and Houston were on the verge of joining Detroit and Puerto Rico among the growing number of places bankrupted by huge pension obligations.
Instead, Texas legislation, which was signed into law this week, will allow the two cities to meet their pension obligations by using measured reductions in pension accruals for workers and retirees, mainly in secondary benefit categories like inflation adjustments and lump-sum payouts.
In exchange, the pension funds will receive more money from the cities to protect core benefits.
The new laws would also establish financial benchmarks that pension funds must meet or face more benefit cuts.
The model may not be perfectly replicated, however.
The relief granted to Dallas and Houston is illegal in many cities and states with similar burdens. California, Illinois, Kansas, Oregon and Pennsylvania are among the states where public pensions cannot be reduced.
Coming Up
At 8:30 a.m., the Labor Department will release data on hiring and unemployment for May. Analysts expect that payrolls will have added 176,000 workers and that the jobless rate will stay at 4.4 percent.

Jobs Report Finds Rate Is Lowest In 16 Years

Full text: Unemployment sank to 4.3 percent in May, its lowest level in 16 years, the government reported Friday, but halfhearted wage growth and a shrinking labor force revealed the economy's stubborn weak spots. While the downsides sent bond prices lower, the report is unlikely to deter the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates when its policy makers meet in Washington this month. "It is not enough to derail the Fed at all," said Dan North, chief economist at the credit insurer Euler Hermes North America.
The milestone on the jobless rate came with a middling increase of 138,000 in payrolls and revisions that reduced the gains in the previous two months. It mainly reflected a decline in the share of working-age adults who have a job or are in the market for one.
The judgment of what constitutes strong or tepid job growth has shifted as the expansion ages. With more baby boomers retiring each year, economists estimate that the monthly addition of roughly 100,000 jobs should be enough to absorb those entering the work force, including newly minted graduates.
"Even though job growth slowed, it's still well above where it needs to be to keep up with the working-age population growth," said Jed Kolko, chief economist at Indeed, an online recruiting site. "It's inevitable that we would start to see a slowdown in the payroll numbers. Month-after-month job gains in the 200,000 range are not sustainable longer term. The working-age population is growing too slowly to support that."
Only twice in the last eight months has that 200,000 figure been reached; the average over the last three months has been 121,000. Analysts are split on whether the slower pace is a sign of the labor market's tightness or its slack. Those who believe the economy is reaching full capacity, or is already there, argue that there are just not that many available workers left.
"Since 2012, this has been a tremendous period of steady, solid job growth -- historic in many ways -- that has slowly absorbed most if not all of the underemployed and unemployed people last year," said Alan MacEachin, chief corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union.
Employers continue to complain about how difficult it is to hire workers. "We have 50 to 60 openings in Pennsylvania and probably close to 100 openings across the country," said Mark Traylor, president of the Ames Companies, whose wheelbarrow factory in Harrisburg recently played host to President Trump.
"We've really had to change our tactics of how we source associates," Mr. Traylor said. His company has begun working with high schools and community colleges to interest students in entry-level manufacturing and distribution jobs -- paying about $15 an hour -- which have been particularly hard to fill.
Skeptics argue that if the labor market were truly stretched, wages would be rising faster. Instead, year-over-year wage growth has declined since the end of last year to 2.5 percent, just a nose in front of inflation.
"That's more of a softening than a tightening story," said Jared Bernstein, who was chief economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. early in the Obama administration.
The skeptics included bond traders who drove yields down on Friday, betting that even if the Fed goes ahead with a rate increase this month, it will think twice about further moves in the second half of the year.
Also troubling is the decline in overall participation in the labor force, which has trudged along below 63 percent during the recovery, compared with more than 66 percent before the recession. Some of the tiny gains that had been made were knocked off in May, showing more people were dropping out of the labor force than returning.
"That's always ugly," said Mr. North, the Euler Hermes economist.
Moreover, he added, those who have been out of the job market for a while or lack up-to-date skills may have less bargaining power when they re-enter. Low wages and fluctuating schedules have also sown anxiety among many Americans.
Among political leaders, responses predictably split along partisan lines.
"We're not worried about slowing job growth," Gary D. Cohn, director of the White House's National Economic Council, told CNBC. He pointed out that the Labor Department's broadest measure of unemployment, which includes part-time workers who would rather have full-time jobs and those too discouraged to search, dropped to 8.4 percent, its lowest level since 2007.
By contrast, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader, said, "May's jobs report is a sobering wake-up call for President Trump and House Republicans, who continue to push a disastrous agenda that targets hard-working American families and endangers economic growth."
Job recruiters continue to see a divergence in the fortunes of workers with advanced skills and those without them.
"The hiring for very specific skilled and highly skilled workers is at an all-time high right now," said Jim Guerrera, managing director at SC Novi in Michigan, a recruiting firm specializing in the industrial and automotive sectors. "But people who don't have a differentiated skill set are having a harder time finding a position."
He said that while large corporations were willing to train workers, smaller firms were more wary. "Less and less people are willing to train," Mr. Guerrera said. Younger people tended to change jobs more frequently in the past, he said, so companies do not want to make the investment only to see their new hires leave in a couple of years.
Sectors with the largest gains included health care, professional and business services, leisure and hospitality, and mining.
The government -- once a pillar of steady, middle-class employment -- shrank by 9,000 jobs, while the retail sector lost more than 6,000. During much of the recovery, retail could be depended on to churn out more jobs. But it has disappointed in 2017, with heavy losses. This week, the clothing company Michael Kors announced that it would close 100 to 125 stores in the next two years.
"Retail isn't dying, but traditional retail is dying," Mr. North said. "There is creeping Armageddon for brick and mortar."
The transformation of the retail business wrought by online commerce has caught the attention of employers across sectors. "There's an overriding concern with everybody I talk to," said Frank Friedman, chief operating officer of the international accounting and consulting firm Deloitte. "How is technology going to disrupt -- if at all -- my business?"

Low Inflation Fails to Deter Fed's Plan To Raise Rates

Full text: WASHINGTON -- A speech by a Federal Reserve governor Tuesday underscored a basic shift in Fed policy: The central bank now needs to be convinced that quarterly rate increases are a bad idea. After years in which any sign of economic weakness was reason enough for the Fed to maintain its stimulus campaign, the Fed is now willing to shrug off at least a little bad data. Lael Brainard, a Federal Reserve governor, told the New York Association for Business Economics that the Fed should raise its benchmark interest rate "soon," despite new evidence that inflation remains below the level the Fed desires.
The comments by Ms. Brainard reinforced expectations that the Fed will raise rates in mid-June at its next meeting, particularly because she has been a consistent advocate of caution. If she is ready to raise rates, there is probably little internal opposition.
"On balance, when assessing economic activity and its likely evolution, it would be reasonable to conclude that further removal of accommodation will likely be appropriate soon," Ms. Brainard said.
But beyond June, Ms. Brainard added, she might reconsider the wisdom of additional rate increases if there is not evidence of stronger inflation. Fed officials have said they would like to raise rates at least once more in the second half of the year.
The Commerce Department reported Tuesday morning that the Fed's preferred measure of inflation rose just 1.5 percent over the 12 months ending in April, well below the 2 percent annual pace that the Fed regards as economically optimal. The annual pace of inflation, moreover, has fallen in each of the past three months.
"If the soft inflation data persist, that would be concerning and, ultimately, could lead me to reassess the appropriate path of policy," Ms. Brainard said in New York.
The Fed raised its benchmark rate in December and again in March, to the current range of 0.75 percent to 1 percent. The chances of another quarter-point increase in June stood at roughly 89 percent at the close of futures trading in Chicago on Tuesday, according to CME Group.
The Fed has kept rates at low levels since the financial crisis to stimulate economic activity by encouraging borrowing and risk-taking. It is gradually raising rates toward historically normal levels as the economy improves. Fed officials have said they hope to return rates to a neutral level by the end of the year.
"My view still is that three rate hikes this year makes sense," John Williams, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, told Bloomberg News in Singapore on Monday. "Nothing has pushed me away from that. We should continue this gradual process of policy normalization in interest rates."
Ms. Brainard on Tuesday also offered an upbeat assessment of the economy. She said it appeared to be rebounding from a weak first quarter, with data showing that consumer spending had strengthened in line with the Fed's expectations. She noted the continued decline of the unemployment rate, which fell to 4.4 percent in April. The government will publish the May jobs report on Friday.
Ms. Brainard, who has carved out a reputation as the Fed official who takes the most active interest in the health of the global economy, also noted that the international outlook has brightened. "For the first time in many years, we are seeing signs of synchronized economic expansions at home and abroad," she said.
Inflation remains the outstanding problem. The Fed aims to maintain moderate inflation, rather than price stability, because that lets the Fed cut interest rates more sharply during an economic downturn.
Inflation also eases downward economic adjustments. Employers, for example, can cut costs by raising wages more slowly than inflation, which may be easier for workers to accept than an outright pay cut.
The Fed also wants to avoid deflation, or price declines, because as things become cheaper each day, consumers and businesses postpone buying and economic activity shrinks more. Measures of inflation are imperfect, and prudence dictates maintaining some distance from zero.
Analysts attribute some of the recent dip in inflation to a price war among providers of cellular service. But forecasters are now predicting that inflation may not reach 2 percent until next year, setting up 2017 as the latest in a long series of years that inflation was predicted to rebound and then failed to meet expectations.
Ms. Brainard described this persistent sluggishness as something of a mystery, particularly given the Fed's view that the labor market is back to normal.
"The puzzle today is why inflation appears to be slowing at a time when most forecasters place the economy at or near full employment," she said.
She described the weakness as a "source of concern," but given the overall strength of the economy, she said, it was not reason enough to delay a rate increase.

Full text: After a brief stumble, the stock market returned to its upward march last week and hit another high. This optimism has left many people confused, even infuriated. Why isn't Wall Street being affected by all the crazy news -- including rumors of impeachment -- coming out of Washington? Where is the Trump Slump? So far, there isn't one, and that's good news for investors but also even for ideological opponents of the president. I've examined stock markets in countries around the world, looking at data over the past three decades. My research shows that a country's stock market often outperforms its peers when a new leader comes to power in emerging countries.
But there is no such positive effect in developed countries. Countries like the United States have structural guardrails in place, like strong independent courts, central banks and other checks on power, that make it more difficult for a single leader to change the nation's direction.
Compare political scandals, for example. In Brazil, the market is struggling to recover after falling nearly 15 percent in dollar value on May 18 perhaps in response to the blockbuster news of a cover-up that could cost the president his job.
In the United States, the stock market fell during the Watergate scandal but for reasons that had little to do with Richard Nixon and much to do with the stagnant economy and inflation. And stock prices rose steadily during the investigations and impeachment of Bill Clinton, until the 1998 collapse of the hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management threatened to trigger a global financial crisis. The same holds for other political scandals, like Teapot Dome and Iran-contra.
It is a mistake, then, to view the markets through an ideologically colored lens.
The data is decidedly more mixed on whether the United States market does better under a Republican or a Democratic administration. If anything, the market over time seems less and less inclined to care which party is in power.
I know plenty of right-wing ideologues who, convinced that President Barack Obama was leading America to ruin, missed out on the market's long bull run. Similarly many Democrats now think President Trump is taking the country down and assume that stock prices will follow.
The stock market is best understood not as a presidential poll but as a barometer of the nation's current economic mood, and it remains buoyant now for reasons unconnected to the White House.
For a few weeks after President Trump's victory, Wall Street was indeed buzzing over how his plans to cut taxes and red tape would stir "animal spirits" and promote American business, albeit at the expense of foreign rivals. Money was coming back to the United States, driving up the value of the dollar. Six months later, the main reason for the market's continued rise has more to do with global rather than local factors. The "Trump bump" is long gone.
Global growth has picked up over the past few months, and the worst fears that caused a short-term slump in Wall Street last year -- like a possible breakup of the European Union after Brexit or a financial crisis in China -- have not materialized. The American economy continues to grow at a steady clip of around 2 percent, while the economies of Europe and Japan are now stronger than at any time since the crisis of 2008.
The American stock market reflects those trends. Despite Mr. Trump's criticism of "globalists," the more internationally oriented companies have outperformed their domestic peers significantly since Inauguration Day. The global forces lifting the United States market have in the meantime been lifting foreign stock markets even faster this year.
Similarly, the American dollar has given up all the gains it recorded in the immediate aftermath of the November election, and the Mexican peso has clawed back most of the losses it incurred when the markets were taking President Trump's threats against the North American Free Trade Agreement more seriously.
On Wall Street today, the chatter about Trumponomics is fading, because many people no longer expect him to accomplish much, for better or worse, whether pushing tax reform or triggering trade wars. Some analysts still worry about how a tax-cut plan based on unrealistic growth assumptions could further bloat the budget deficit, or how limiting immigration could undermine the economy.
But those story lines are expected to play out at a glacial pace, well outside the market's forecast horizon, which is measurable in months, not years. Corporate profits have started to revive in recent months based on a recovering global economy. As long as that continues and the cost of money remains close to zero, courtesy of the Fed, the default path for the market is up.
None of this is to suggest that there are no risks to the bull market, now in its ninth year. Stocks in the United States have seldom risen for so long without a major setback and have never been more expensively valued, outside the tech boom of the late 1990s. History shows that bull runs tend to last until the next recession starts, so the question is where the next downturn comes from.
If emerging inflation pressures prompt the Fed to raise interest rates more quickly, the economy could stumble and take the market with it. More significantly, there are still threats to the world economy, including China's debt bubble. If it bursts, it could cause the next global recession, hitting the American market hard.
So there is much to worry about in the markets, but it is important to worry about the right things. The cloud of scandal around the White House is not high on the list. Mr. Trump's mercurial ways may be a source of great concern or indifference, depending on your ideological leanings. But Wall Street doesn't seem to care one way or other.

Full text: STORM LAKE, Iowa -- When Dan Smith first went to work at the pork processing plant in Storm Lake in 1980, pretty much the only way to nab that kind of union job was to have a father, an uncle or a brother already there. The pay, he recalled, was $16 an hour, with benefits -- enough to own a home, a couple of cars, a camper and a boat, while your wife stayed home with the children. "It was the best-paying job you could get, 100 percent, if you were unskilled," said Mr. Smith, now 66, who followed his father through the plant gates.
After nearly four decades at the plant, most of them as a forklift driver, Mr. Smith is retiring this month.
The union is long gone, and so are most of the white faces of men who once labored in the broiling heat of the killing floor and the icy chill of the production lines. What hasn't changed much is Mr. Smith's hourly wage, which is still about $16 an hour, the same as when he started 37 years ago. Had his wages kept up with inflation, he would be earning about $47 an hour.
The forces that have helped transform this snug lakeside town in northwestern Iowa and others like it during Mr. Smith's working life have created a complex swirl of economic successes and hardships, optimism and unease.
Fierce global competition, agricultural automation and plant closures have left many rural towns struggling for survival. In areas stripped of the farm and union jobs that paid middle-class wages and tempted the next generation to stay put and raise a family, young people are more likely to move on to college or urban centers like Des Moines. Left behind are an aging population, abandoned storefronts and shrinking economic prospects.
Yet Storm Lake, hustled along by the relentless drive of manufacturers to cut labor costs and by the town's grit to survive, is still growing. However clumsily at times, this four-square-mile patch has absorbed successive waves of immigrants and refugees -- from Asia, from Mexico and Central America, and from Africa.
They fill most of the grueling, low-paid jobs at the pork, egg and turkey plants; they spend money at local shops, and open restaurants and grocery stores; they fill church pews and home-team benches. While more than 88 percent of the state's population is non-Hispanic white, less than half of Storm Lake's is. Walk through the halls of the public schools and you can hear as many as 18 languages.
But if the newcomers have brought some of the economic dynamism that President Trump promised to restore to the struggling Midwest and South, they have also fed some of the anxieties and resentments that he stirred.
Steve King, the Republican congressman for this predominantly white, conservative district, blames immigrants and refugees for pushing down wages, bringing unwelcome cultural diversity and burdening public services.
While Mr. King's nativist comments have been labeled racist by critics, his fervent animosity to immigration has done little over the years to dent his electoral popularity in most of the 39 counties he represents.
Storm Lake, with a population of roughly 11,000, is in no way immune to the strains and tensions that an influx of poor, low-skilled and non-English-speaking immigrants and refugees can bring. But after decades of living and working together, the residents recognize that their future is a shared one.
"Other communities our size are shrinking and consolidating school districts," said Mark Prosser, the police chief. "We have schools bulging at the seams. There are expensive challenges, but which one do you want: a dying community or one that has growth?"
Less than a half-mile from the police station, the shelves at Valentina's Meat Market offer a still-life version of the town's inhabitants. A kaleidoscope of packages, jars and produce from nearly every continent is jammed in -- side by side are purple yams from Laos, green plantains from Ecuador, mahogany-brown cassava from Nigeria, tan egg roll wrappers from Vietnam.
Silvino Morelos, the Mexican-born owner, has lived in Storm Lake for more than 20 years. He came after his grocery business in Los Angeles was looted and burned during the racially charged 1992 riots that followed the acquittal of four white police officers accused of beating a black motorist, Rodney King. Here, he said, he has always felt welcome and secure.
"A lot of different communities are living together," said Mr. Morelos, who aims to feed them all.
His wife, Mayela, works from 5 a.m. to 2 p.m. at the pork plant, earning $18 an hour, before handling the register at Valentina's until the early evening. Mr. Morelos often doesn't finish up before midnight, he said, and rarely takes a day off. He recently bought a 22-acre farm about five minutes outside of town where he is raising lambs and goats. Dedicated workers, he said, can live "a good life."
'Just Trying to Make a Buck'
Shared ambitions and a willingness to work hard command respect across cultures here.
Mr. Smith, looking back on his decades at the plant, acknowledges that a supply of immigrants makes it easier for employers to pay less, but he doesn't begrudge them the work.
"I harbor no ill feelings for anybody who's trying to make a better life for themselves," he said, settling on the living room couch in his home, a corner house next to the railroad tracks, which he shares with his girlfriend. "They're just trying to make a buck for their family, like I am."
Mr. Smith remembers that it wasn't the arrival of foreign workers that initially drove down wages, but the plant owners.
First was Hygrade Food Products Corporation, an old-style meatpacking house that introduced Ball Park Franks to the Detroit Tigers' stadium in 1957 and operated the Storm Lake plant when Mr. Smith went to work there. Faced with competition from new companies that had developed a faster, more efficient method of boxing beef and selling it to supermarket chains and fast-food outlets, Hygrade in 1981 asked its workers to take a pay cut of $3 an hour. When they refused, the plant closed.
With vigorous support from town leaders, the upstart Iowa Beef Processors (later known as IBP) bought and reopened it a few months later -- slashing wages by more than half and shunning the union.
At that point, Mr. Smith returned to do night cleanup, earning $5.50 an hour with no benefits, but a vast majority of his former co-workers were turned away, he said, because the new owner did not want to hire union supporters. Instead, the company began actively recruiting in Mexico and in immigrant communities in Texas and California.
"They learned real fast to keep a sharp knife and didn't complain if they had a sore arm," Mr. Smith said.
The new form of meatpacking that sprang up in Iowa and the Midwest transformed the industry. "There was lower pay, faster lines and higher injury rates," said David Swenson, a regional scientist in the economics department at Iowa State University.
Tyson Foods bought IBP in 2001, and its red oval logo greets visitors as they drive into town. Tacked onto the entry gate, a large banner announces, "New starting pay" -- $15 an hour on the production line.
Even at that level, more than twice the state's $7.25 minimum wage, workers can be hard to come by. Standing in the same spot for eight hours or more at a time, in near-freezing temperatures, slashing at carcasses that swing by at a fast pace, can numb body and soul. The poultry industry also ranks among the most dangerous in the United States, according to a new report by the National Employment Law Project.
Even if pay were raised to $20 or $25 an hour, Mr. Smith said, "I don't think you could get white guys."
Those who are hired can be dogged by a common negative stereotype. As one supervisor at the plant recalled, some of the Mexican workers on the line complained after he hired a white worker, saying: "This guy is not going to last as long. He's young and he's not going to work hard."
Most of the 2,200 workers now at the pork plant are primarily of Hispanic descent, said Caroline Ahn, a spokeswoman for Tyson. Asians make up the second-largest group, followed by Caucasians. Men slightly outnumber women. She would not specify the turnover rate, but several employees said the company was engaged in a never-ending hiring campaign.
In Buena Vista County, which includes Storm Lake, the jobless rate has dropped to 2.7 percent, and both small and large businesses complain that they cannot find enough workers. The competitive squeeze is expected to only worsen when two new pork plants open in nearby Sioux City and Eagle Grove.
But Mr. Swenson at Iowa State is skeptical of employer complaints about labor shortages. For an industry that needs to be where the animals are, he said, the only answer is to "pay workers enough to retain them or attract them."
Art Cullen, the Pulitzer Prize-winning editor of his family-run newspaper, The Storm Lake Times, acknowledges that processing-plant work is tough. Yet for a refugee or an immigrant without English or skills, butchering livestock at that wage, he said, is a "first rung on the American ladder to success."
That was the way it worked for Abel Saengchanpheng, who came to Storm Lake from Northern California in 1997, when he was 16, after relatives talked up the job opportunities there. Born in a Thai refugee camp after his family escaped from Laos, Mr. Saengchanpheng, now 36 and an American citizen, joined his parents at the plant after he finished high school. He has been there ever since, working his way up to general foreman in 2013, and he now oversees 300 production workers.
With earnings that place him comfortably in Storm Lake's upper middle class, he owns two cars, a Subaru and a Honda, and a home.
"I was so blessed to get into Tyson," he said, sipping coffee at Grand Central Coffee Station. "I remember looking at the first paycheck and thinking, 'There is free money going around."'
The work, though, can feed drudgery as well as dreams.
Blanca Martinez, who came from El Salvador with her husband (a naturalized citizen who lived in Storm Lake) and their daughter, now 5, has been at the turkey plant for two years. She earns $15.70 an hour cutting bone six days a week on the 6 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. shift.
"It's very hard," Ms. Martinez, 37, a permanent resident, said in Spanish through an interpreter. "I'm still not used to the cold." At work, she wears three gloves on her left hand and two on her right -- giving her cutting hand a little more flexibility.
Speaking English would widen her options, Ms. Martinez said, but she has had no time for lessons since her husband received a diagnosis of cancer.
'This Is Who We Are Now'
The contrast between Storm Lake and many neighboring towns is both by accident and by design.
Refugees from Southeast Asia made their way to the area more than 40 years ago, when Iowa became the first state to offer resettlement assistance at the end of the Vietnam War.
"That was a proactive choice on the part of community leaders," said the Rev. Charles Valenti-Hein, the pastor at Lakeside Presbyterian Church, which sponsored the first group. Making room for other immigrants, he said, was "an extension of that initial act of hospitality, something we've chosen."
Other residents suggested that the proximity of a university, Buena Vista, with some minority faculty members and students, as well as the town's location as a central stopping point on sales routes, may have contributed to the openness.
Yet the flood of Mexican recruits who were funneled to the IBP plant in the 1990s engendered suspicion and tensions. School overcrowding, a surge in uncompensated care at the hospitals and a new need for translators drained city coffers. Complaints about a rise in crime and drugs followed.
"There was a collective holding of breath as the community started to change," said Mr. Prosser, the police chief since 1989 and a Catholic deacon. "At first, people born and raised here felt, 'We want it to go back to the way it was."'
But over time, the community evolved, he said. The immigrants and refugees bought homes, opened businesses and saw their children graduate from school. Nonprofit and advocacy groups sprouted to ease the transition. The police department hired bilingual community liaisons. Most residents still don't bother to lock their doors.
"We've had all sorts of problems over a period of 30 to 35 years," Mr. Prosser said. "But the pros so outweigh the cons, and the community as a whole understands that, and for the most part they've embraced it."
Some surrounding towns have embraced the model, while others have rejected it. Decades ago, the picturesque city of Spencer, about 40 miles north, spurned the overtures of a packing plant, with some residents saying at the time that they didn't want their town to turn into Storm Lake.
Other Iowa towns, like Denison, have followed Storm Lake's lead, though the rapid transition has brought growing pains.
The Rev. Timothy Friedrichsen was the Roman Catholic pastor in Denison before coming to St. Mary's Church in Storm Lake in 2013. "I was aghast at the open hostility towards immigrants that cropped up pretty regularly," he said of Denison, where the Latino population doubled in less than a decade.
"Though some people still feel, 'This is not the Storm Lake I grew up in,"' he said, for most of the population, "there is a kind of comfortableness. This is who we are now."
The most palpable anxiety these days has been fueled by Mr. Trump's statements on immigrants and border control.
Graciele Vrieze, a Spanish-speaking civilian community-service officer with the local police department, said her 13-year-old son, an Iowa-born citizen, had come home from school asking if they were all going to be deported to Mexico. There are few reliable statistics on the number of foreign-born residents with fake or no documents; estimates run to the thousands. Several with documents also said they were postponing trips abroad, however, because of the fear that they may not be allowed to return.
The drive among refugees and immigrants to remain in or return to Storm Lake stands out in a state where more than two-thirds of the counties are shrinking in population. "I love my town," Mr. Smith said, but all three of his children and both of his girlfriend's have moved elsewhere.
Most of the farm boys and farmers' daughters have left, said Mr. Cullen of The Storm Lake Times. "Second-generation immigrants want to stay with their families," he said from the cozy one-room newsroom. He jumped up from his chair to hunt among the stacks of newspapers for a recent edition that featured a scholarship student from El Salvador returning from college to Storm Lake to start a house-painting business. "Those kids are our future."
Immigrant parents who labor on the production lines say they want their children to go to college instead of taking their places at the plant. But the expectation is that those children will return home after graduating.
Ms. Martinez, the worker at the turkey plant, does not have time to take English classes herself, but the future she envisions for her 5-year-old includes going to medical school, becoming a doctor and then coming home to work here in Storm Lake.

Full text: LOS ANGELES -- "Thar be squalls ahead." An old salt offers that warning as riders set sail on Pirates of the Caribbean, the classic Disney theme park ride, and Walt Disney Studios knew the same admonishment held true for a fifth movie based on it: Moving ahead with "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales" would mean navigating around critics and wooing back disappointed fans.
But the profit potential was too big to ignore. The fourth chapter, subtitled "On Stranger Tides," was roundly seen as a creative dud, but it still took in $1 billion worldwide. Disney, convinced it could reinvigorate the franchise by fixing certain problems -- nonsensical story lines, lackluster new characters -- pressed forward.
The result: "Dead Men Tell No Tales," which cost roughly $400 million to make and market worldwide, collected about $62.2 million from Friday through Sunday at North American theaters, or 38 percent less than "On Stranger Tides" did over its first three days in 2011, after adjusting for inflation. The new film, advertised as the franchise's "final adventure" (hah!), is expected to add about $14.4 million in ticket sales on Memorial Day. ("On Stranger Tides" was not released on a holiday weekend.)
Reviews were horrible. Ticket buyers, however, gave the new film an A-minus grade in CinemaScore exit polls.
Overseas, "Dead Men Tell No Tales" collected a strong $208 million, or 17 percent more than "On Stranger Tides" managed in the same countries, after adjusting for inflation, Disney said. The top foreign market was China, where the latest installment sold about $67.8 million in tickets, the strongest opening by far for a "Pirates" movie in that country, perhaps showing the impact of the Shanghai Disneyland, which opened last year and includes an entire themed area dedicated to the franchise.
The other major new studio movie to arrive in theaters over the weekend, "Baywatch," from Paramount Pictures, was relatively dead in the water. Costing roughly $125 million to make and market, "Baywatch" sold about $18.1 million in tickets in North America, for a total since arriving on Thursday of $22.7 million, according to comScore. Memorial Day is expected to add $3.9 million.
Analysts had expected "Baywatch" to collect about $40 million from Thursday through Monday, in part because Paramount backed the film with a frothy, inventive marketing campaign. One of the movie's producers, Beau Flynn, was so confident heading into the weekend that he boasted of sequel plans. "We have an amazing story already," he told Variety.
But many critics complained that "Baywatch" was poorly made, and quality has become increasingly important to ticket buyers, at least in the United States, which remains the world's No. 1 movie market. The R-rated lifeguard film, directed by Seth Gordon ("Horrible Bosses") and credited to six writers, starred Dwayne Johnson and Zac Efron and was based on the television series that ran from 1989 to 2001.
Paramount and its various financing partners had seen an opportunity to replicate the rollicking success of "21 Jump Street," which made a successful leap from TV to big screens in 2012 and spawned a sequel, "22 Jump Street," in 2014. But there is ample evidence that moviegoers do not like repurposed TV shows. Recent disappointments have included "CHIPS" and "Entourage."
"Baywatch" will roll out overseas in June. So far, it has only opened in Taiwan, where it took in $873,000 over the weekend, which Paramount noted was sharply higher than initial "22 Jump Street" results.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text: To the Editor: Re "Student Debt's Grip on the Economy" (editorial, May 21):
Hand-wringing over the cost of a college education, which is two and a half times what it was in 1978-79, adjusted for inflation, while median income has risen only 20 percent, is certainly warranted. And your suggestions for easing the burden of student loans -- better repayment plans, enabling wage growth for debtors -- make good sense. But we've heard this song many times before to no avail.
Focus on the consequences of crushing debt doesn't address the root problem: Why are college costs out of control? Let's take a look at a range of institutions of higher learning, public and private, to see exactly why they have become out of reach for so many Americans.
Is the education two and a half times better? Are there ways to cut costs without sacrificing the core mission? What is the role of large endowment funds?
Too often, preoccupation with the effect of a problem ignores its cause.
LILA S. ROSENBLUM, NEW YORK
To the Editor:
The American Association of University Women is bringing a gender lens to the student debt crisis in our report "Deeper in Debt: Women and Student Loans." Women are now the majority of college students, but they also take on more student debt than men do, and female graduates take longer to repay that debt partly because of the gender pay gap.
As a result, women hold almost two-thirds of student debt in the United States and have a harder time making ends meet while repaying their student loans.
Women and men both use higher education to start careers that lead to economic security, but women are particularly reliant on education as a leg up. Student debt is threatening to turn that education from an opportunity into a trap.
KEVIN MILLER, WASHINGTON
The writer is a senior researcher at the American Association of University Women.
To the Editor:
In the countless discussions about student debt, why isn't anyone talking about the schools to which all of this money is being paid?
The lavish capital improvement projects at both my alma mater and my daughter's university ($66,000 a year) make me wonder if tuition really has to be as high as it is.
It seems to me that the schools should be taking steps to tighten their belts and figuring out ways to reduce student debt instead of just spend, spend, spend.
KATHY EVANS WISNER GLENCOE, ILL.
To the Editor:
The solution to the millstone of student debt is to accord vocational education the respect it deserves. For example, welders earn salaries in the high five and low six figures without having to repay four-year loans for their education.
The reality is that college is not for everyone. But as long as we persist in the fiction that the absence of a bachelor's degree means substandard salaries for life, too many students will be victimized.

Flying Was Never Fun

Full text: It's pile-on time for America's commercial airlines. The contempt people hold for them has long been severe, but following a raft of highly publicized incidents, resentment has hit a fever pitch. It started about a month ago, with the forced removal of a passenger onboard a United Express flight. This was followed by several more airlines-behaving-badly controversies, up to and including the death of Simon, a giant rabbit who perished after a London-to-Chicago United flight. Over and over we are reminded about the hellishness that is commercial flying. Enabled by cellphone cameras and the catalyst of social media, even the most mundane boarding snafu or onboard fracas has been getting its 15 minutes.
I'm a commercial pilot, so I take some of this personally. I also think it's time for a slightly different perspective.
People often talk about a proverbial "golden age" of air travel, and if only we could return to it. That's an easy sentiment to sympathize with. I'm old enough to recall when people actually looked forward to flying. I remember a trip to Florida in 1979, and my father putting on a coat and tie for the occasion. I remember cheesecake desserts on a 60-minute flight in economy. Yes, things were once a little more comfortable, a little more special.
One of the reasons that flying has become such a melee is because so many people now have the means to partake in it. It wasn't always this way. Adjusted for inflation, the average cost of a ticket has declined about 50 percent over the past 35 years. This isn't true in every market, but on the whole fares are far cheaper than they were 30 years ago. (And yes, this is after factoring in all of those add-on "unbundling" fees that airlines love and passengers so despise.)
For my parents' generation, it cost several thousand dollars in today's money to travel to Europe. Even coast-to-coast trips were something relatively few could afford. As recently as the 1970s, an economy ticket from New York to Hawaii cost nearly $3,000, adjusted for inflation.
Not only are tickets cheaper, but we have got a wider range of options. There are planes going everywhere, all the time. Pretty much any two major cities in the world are now connected through at most one stop: Los Angeles to Delhi; New York to Fuzhou, China; Toronto to Nairobi. Overall journey times used to be much longer, and flying from the United States to points overseas meant having to connect at one of only a handful of gateway airports, with additional stops beyond.
Even well into the jet age, what today would be a simple nonstop or one-stop itinerary could include multiple stopovers. Not just internationally, but domestically, too: Three stops in a DC-9 to reach St. Louis from Albany, then another two stops on the trunk route over to Seattle or San Francisco.
Sure, you had more legroom and a hot meal. It also took you 14 hours to fly coast-to-coast, or two-and-a-half days to reach Karachi, Pakistan. Miss your flight? The next one didn't leave in 90 minutes; it left the following day -- or the following week.
I could mention, too, that the airplanes of decades past were louder -- few things were more deafening than a 707 at takeoff thrust -- and more gas-guzzling and polluting. And if, in 2017, you're put off by a lack of legroom or having to pay for a sandwich, how would you feel about sitting for eight hours in a cabin filled with tobacco smoke? As recently as the 1990s, smoking was still permitted on airplanes.
As for legroom, there's that conventional wisdom again, contending that airlines are forever cramming more rows into their aircraft. Except it's not necessarily true. The spacing between rows, called "pitch" in the business, is, on average, less than it was 20 or 30 years ago -- and yes, passengers themselves have become larger on average -- but only slightly. Remember Laker Airways, whose "Skytrain" service ran between the United States and London in the 1970s and early '80s? Sir Freddie Laker, the airline's flamboyant founder, configured his DC-10s with a bone-crunching 345 seats -- about a hundred more than the typical DC-10 at the time.
And what's that in front of you? It's a personal video screen with hundreds of on-demand movies and TV shows. No, not every carrier has these, but on longer flights it's a standard amenity, along with USB and power ports. Onboard Wi-Fi is widespread. Remember when the "in-flight movie" was projected onto a blurry bulkhead screen, and you listened through one of those stethoscope-style headsets with jagged plastic cups that scratched into your ear?
Up front, in first or business class, forget it. You can have your Pullman berths and caviar on the flying boats of the 1940s, trundling along noisily, 17 hours from New York to Paris. You can have your tuxedoed stewards and your piano lounges in the old 747 upper deck. I'll take the state-of-the-art sleeper seat and 25-inch screen; the electric privacy barrier and five-course dinner presentation. It's no contest; premium class has never been as swanky or as comfortable as it is today.
Then there's safety.
Globally -- catastrophes like those involving Malaysia Airlines Flights 17 and 370 included -- the last 10 years have been the safest in the history of commercial aviation. Here in North America the stats are even more astonishing: There has not been a major crash involving an American legacy carrier in more than 15 years. By comparison, in 1985, 27 air disasters killed almost 2,500 people worldwide. During the 1960s, the United States saw an average of four major crashes every year. United alone had seven major accidents in a five-year span.
The 1960s, '70s and '80s also were rife with terrorist bombings and hijackings: Pan Am 103, Air-India, UTA and TWA, among others. Between the late '60s and early '70s, American commercial aircraft were hijacked at a rate of nearly once per week. Airport terminal attacks were frequent throughout that era as well.
For a number of reasons -- technological, regulatory and infrastructural -- aviation accidents have become a lot fewer and farther between. There are twice as many planes in the air as there were just 25 years ago, yet the rate of fatal accidents per miles flown has been steadily falling. The International Civil Aviation Organization reports that for every million flights the chance of a crash is one-sixth what it was in 1980. Hijackings and terrorist attacks, for all of the attention lavished on their mere possibility, have become even rarer.
There's no denying that airlines today could and should do a better job -- at communicating, at treating their customers with dignity and respect. I'm well acquainted with the nuisances of modern-day air travel: I don't enjoy claustrophobic planes, delays, noisy airports or wasteful security practices any more than you do.
But those good old days, maybe, are more mythical than we admit. Do you really want to travel like people did in the 1960s? Are you sure? No, you don't have to love flying. But you shouldn't take it for granted, either.

The Assault on Colleges -- and the American Dream

Full text: The country's most powerful engine of upward mobility is under assault. Public colleges have an unmatched record of lofting their students into the middle class and beyond. For decades, they have enrolled teenagers and adults from modest backgrounds, people who are often the first member of their family to attend college, and changed their trajectories.
Over the last several years, however, most states have cut their spending on higher education, some drastically. Many public universities have responded by enrolling fewer poor and middle-class students -- and replacing them with affluent students who can afford the tuition.
The situation is particularly demoralizing because it's happening even as politicians from both parties spend more time trumpeting their supposedly deep concern for the American dream. Yet government policy is hurting, not fostering, many people's chance to earn the most reliable ticket to a good job and a better life.
The decline of economic diversity at top public colleges is the clearest pattern in The Times's third annual ranking of leading colleges -- the roughly 170 nationwide with a five-year graduation rate of at least 75 percent. (Yes, you can be disappointed that so few colleges clear that bar.)
The ranking, called the College Access Index, is based on how many low- and middle-income students colleges graduate and how much those students must pay. The index is a measure of which top institutions are doing the most to promote the American dream.
Many are doing less than they once did. At the public colleges in the index, the average share of last year's freshman class receiving Pell grants -- which means they typically come from the bottom half of the income distribution -- fell to 21.8 percent, from 24.3 percent in 2011-12. Campuses with declining economic diversity include the Universities of Florida, Michigan, Minnesota, Pittsburgh and Wisconsin, as well as Binghamton, Ohio State and Rutgers.
By comparison, the Pell share has recently held roughly constant at top private colleges, around 16 percent.
Some of the biggest declines have been in the University of California system, which has long been the most economically diverse place in elite higher education. On the San Diego campus five years ago, 46 percent of freshmen received Pell grants. Last year, the share had dropped to 26 percent. When I first saw that number in The Times database, I figured it was a typo.
It wasn't. The United States is investing less in college education, at the same time that the globalized, digital economy has made that education more important than ever. Gaps between college graduates and everyone else are growing in one realm of society after another, including unemployment, wealth and health.
Given these trends, the declines in state funding are stunning. It's as if our society were deliberately trying to restrict opportunities and worsen income inequality.
Since 2008, states' per-student spending on higher education has fallen 18 percent nationwide, according to inflation-adjusted numbers from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The cuts have occurred in both blue and red states, with somewhat larger ones in Republican-run states. States made deep cuts after the financial crisis and have since failed to restore funding, choosing instead to cut taxes or spend money on health care, prisons or other areas.
"States are making it much more difficult for their residents to get high-quality higher education," Sandy Baum of the Urban Institute said. "They are causing their institutions to charge more, to take more out of state students, to cut quality. It's very shortsighted." That's exactly the right word, because spending on education often more than pays for itself in the long run.
The budget cuts affect every realm of higher education, with some of the biggest damage happening at community colleges and less selective four-year institutions. These campuses enroll the great majority of lower-income college students. Yet flagship public campuses -- like those in Ann Arbor, Mich., Boulder, Colo., and Gainesville, Fla. -- are important to upward mobility too, given the success of their graduates.
In the last few years, many flagships have begun to recruit more upper-income students from outside their state, including from overseas. Those students don't qualify for in-state tuition or for much financial aid -- and thus help bolster the colleges' budgets.
Often, college officials describe the strategy in different terms. They say that they are trying to lift their campus's national profile, not to mention its U.S. News ranking. To do so, they must recruit a larger pool of students with high test scores than exists in their own state.
But the net result, to put it bluntly, is bad for the country. Top state universities are displacing impressive low-income students, who have often overcome troubled neighborhoods and high schools. Many of those students then enroll instead in colleges with fewer resources and higher dropout rates. In the process, the higher-education system becomes a bit less meritocratic.
The story in California is a bit more nuanced, but still disappointing, particularly given the state university's history. Since its founding, during a burst of national investment during and just after Abraham Lincoln's presidency, no other university in the world has combined academic excellence and broad access so well.
John Aubrey Douglass, an education scholar, describes that combination as "the California idea." The top five colleges in this year's College Access Index ranking are still University of California campuses: Irvine, Santa Barbara, Davis, San Diego and Los Angeles. Berkeley ranks ninth, while the private colleges in the top 10 are Amherst, Pomona and Harvard. .
Yet even as California remains a leader, it is also inching away from its legacy.
With state support down, university leaders have decided that their least bad option is to enroll more high-income students. In only four years, undergraduate enrollment in the University of California system has risen 15 percent, or by 27,000 students. The expansion has allowed the colleges to continue enrolling similar numbers of lower-income students, rather than displacing those students, but it has created severe crowding.
"It's pretty bad," Gabriel Schneider, an editor of The Triton student newspaper on the San Diego campus, told me. Single dormitory rooms have been turned into doubles and even triples. Libraries and other common spaces are packed. The university tried to convert an art gallery into a classroom, only to back down after an uproar.
On the Davis campus, near Sacramento, the crowding has particularly harmed less affluent students, because apartment rents have jumped. "The housing shortage in Davis is just horrible," said Scott Dresser, a fourth-year student. Some students are now commuting from Woodland, 10 miles away, said Eli Flesch, another fourth-year student.
What would be a better solution?
For one thing, universities should be scouring their budgets, looking for spending that's less important to their mission than economic diversity and meritocracy are. There is no shortage of suspects: struggling academic programs, spiffy recreation centers, expensive sports teams, bureaucratic bloat.
But such cuts are not the only answer, even if some governors and state legislators claim otherwise. This country should also be investing more of its resources in education.
A century ago, it did precisely that, making high school universal and making possible the so-called American century. Today's economy demands many more college graduates than the country currently has. Producing them won't be free. But it will be worth it.
The alternative -- which is the path we're now on -- is just about the worst economic-development strategy imaginable.
In a follow-up column next week, I'll focus on the private colleges in the College Access Index.

Full text: The townhouse on High Seas Court in the Cove Village development, in the Baltimore suburb of Essex, was not exactly the Cape Cod retreat that its address implied: It was a small unit looking onto a parking lot, the windows of its two bedrooms so high and narrow that a child would have had to stand on a chair to see out of them. But to Kamiia Warren, who moved into the townhouse in 2004, it was a refuge, and a far cry from the East Baltimore neighborhood where she grew up. "I mean, there were bunny rabbits all hopping around," she told me recently. In the townhouse next door lived an older woman with whom Warren became friendly, even doing her grocery shopping once in a while. But over the course of a few months, the woman started acting strangely. She began accosting Warren's visitors. She shouted through the walls during the day. And at night she banged on the wall, right where Warren kept the bassinet in which her third child slept, waking him up.
Warren sent a letter reporting the problem to the complex's property manager, a company called Sawyer Realty Holdings. When there was no response, she decided to move out. In January 2010, she submitted the requisite form giving two months' notice that she was transferring her Section 8 voucher -- the federal low-income subsidy that helped her pay the rent -- elsewhere. The complex's on-site manager signed the form a week later, checking the line that read "The tenant gave notice in accordance with the lease."
So Warren was startled in January 2013, three years later, when she received a summons from a private process server informing her that she was being sued for $3,014.08 by the owner of Cove Village. The lawsuit, filed in Maryland District Court, was doubly bewildering. It claimed she owed the money for having left in advance of her lease's expiration, though she had received written permission to leave. And the company suing her was not Sawyer, but one whose name she didn't recognize: JK2 Westminster L.L.C.
Warren was raising three children alone while taking classes for a bachelor's degree in health care administration, and she disregarded the summons at first. But JK2 Westminster's lawyers persisted; two more summonses followed. In April 2014, she appeared without a lawyer at a district-court hearing. She told the judge about the approval for her move, but she did not have a copy of the form the manager had signed. The judge ruled against Warren, awarding JK2 Westminster the full sum it was seeking, plus court costs, attorney's fees and interest that brought the judgment to nearly $5,000. There was no way Warren, who was working as a home health aide, was going to be able to pay such a sum. "I was so desperate," she said.
If the case was confounding to Warren, it was not unique. Hundreds like it have been filed over the last five years by JK2 Westminster and affiliated businesses in the state of Maryland alone, where the company owns some 8,000 apartments and townhouses. Nor was JK2 Westminster quite as anonymous as its opaque name suggested. It was a subsidiary of a large New York real estate firm called Kushner Companies, which was led by a young man whose initials happened to be J.K.: Jared Kushner.
When Americans were introduced last year to Ivanka Trump's husband and the nation's prospective son-in-law in chief, it was as the preternaturally poised, Harvard-educated scion of a real estate empire whose glittering ambitions resembled Donald Trump's own. In 2007, Kushner Companies, run at the time by Jared and his father, Charles, bought the aluminum-clad skyscraper at 666 Fifth Avenue for a record-breaking $1.8 billion; they are now seeking partners for a $12 billion plan to replace it with a glass tower that would be 40 stories taller. In 2013 they acquired 17 buildings in Manhattan's East Village for about $130 million, and three years later they spent $715 million on a cluster of buildings owned by the Jehovah's Witnesses on prime land in Brooklyn's fast-developing Dumbo district.
But the Kushners' empire, like Trump's, was underwritten by years of dealing in much more modestly ambitioned properties. Jared's grandfather Joseph Kushner, a Holocaust survivor from Belarus, over his lifetime built a small construction company in New Jersey into a real estate venture that owned and managed some 4,000 low-rise units concentrated in the suburbs of Newark. After taking over the business, Charles expanded Kushner Companies' holdings to commercial and industrial spaces, but the company's bread and butter remained the North Jersey apartment complexes bequeathed to him by his father.
In the mid-2000s, the company began to sell off the more than 25,000 multifamily rental units it owned, culminating in a 2007 sale of nearly 17,000 units for $1.9 billion. The sale -- near the peak of the housing boom, just months before the crash -- was impeccably timed, but it also reflected a shift in the attentions of what would soon be a three-generation real estate dynasty. Charles, a major Democratic Party donor, had returned late the previous year from a brief stint in federal prison after pleading guilty to 18 counts of tax evasion, witness tampering and illegal campaign donations. Back at the helm of the company, he began to shift its focus from New Jersey to New York City -- and prepared to pass the reins to his son Jared, who had just received a degree in law and business from New York University.
But amid the high-profile Manhattan and Brooklyn purchases, in 2011, Kushner Companies, with Jared now more firmly in command, pulled together a deal that looked much more like something from the firm's humble past than from its high-rolling present. That June, the company and its equity partners bought 4,681 units of what are known in real estate jargon as "distress-ridden, Class B" apartment complexes: units whose prices fell somewhere in the middle of the market, typically of a certain age and wear, whose owners were in financial difficulty. The properties were spread across 12 sites in Toledo, Ohio; Pittsburgh; and other Rust Belt cities still reeling from the Great Recession. Kushner had to settle more than 200 debts held against the complexes before the deal could go through; at one complex, in Pittsburgh, circumstances had become so dire that some residents had been left without heat and power because the previous owner couldn't pay the bills. Prudential, which was foreclosing on the portfolio, sold it for only $72 million -- half the value of the mortgages on the properties.
In the following months, Kushner Companies bought another 1,700 multifamily units in similar markets, according to the trade publication Multifamily Executive. Unlike the company's big New York investments, the complexes were not acquired with an eye toward appreciation -- these were not growing markets, after all -- but toward producing a steady cash flow. "Our goal is to keep buying and incrementally growing -- they're good markets where you can get yield," Jared Kushner told Multifamily Executive in October 2011, predicting that the net income for the year's purchases would be $14 million within a year. The complexes buttressed the Kushner portfolio in another way, he said: They would serve as a hedge against an upswing in inflation he believed was looming on the horizon.
A year later, in August 2012, a Kushner-led investment group bought 5,500 multifamily units in the Baltimore area with $371 million in financing from Freddie Mac, the government-backed mortgage lender -- another considerable bargain. Two years later, Kushner Companies picked up three more complexes in the Baltimore area for $37.9 million. Today, Westminster Management, Kushner Companies' property-management arm, lists 34 complexes under its control in Maryland, Ohio and New Jersey, with a total of close to 20,000 units.
Kushner's largest concentration of multifamily units is in the Baltimore area, where the company controls 15 complexes in all -- which, if you assume three residents per unit, could be home to more than 20,000 people. All but two of the complexes are in suburban Baltimore County, but they are only "suburban" in the most literal sense. They sit along arterial shopping strips or highways, yet they are easy to miss -- the Highland Village complex, for example, is beside the Baltimore-Washington Parkway, but the tall sound barriers dividing it from the six-lane highway render its more than 1,000 units invisible to the thousands traveling that route every day.
The complexes date mostly from the 1960s and '70s, when white flight from the city was creating a huge demand for affordable housing in Baltimore County. They were meant to exude middle-class respectability -- unglamorous but safe and pleasant enough, a renter's Levittown. Since then, however, they have slipped socioeconomically, along with the middle class itself, into the vast gray area of the modern precariat -- home to casino workers, distribution-warehouse pickers, Uber drivers, students at for-profit colleges. Although most of the tenants I met in a series of recent visits to the complexes pay their own rent, ranging from about $800 to $1,300, some of them receive Section 8 assistance, as Kamiia Warren did; Baltimore County has no public housing for a population of more than 825,000, so these and similar complexes have become the de facto substitute.
At the time of the 2012 Baltimore purchase, Kushner raved about the promise of the low-end multifamily market. "It's proven over the last few years to be the most resilient asset class, and at the end of the day, it's a very stable asset class," he told Multifamily Executive. He said things were proceeding well in the Midwestern complexes he purchased a year earlier. "It was a lot of construction and a lot of evictions," he said. "But the communities now look great, and the outcome has been phenomenal."
Kamiia Warren still had not paid the $4,984.37 judgment against her by late 2014. Three days before Christmas that year, JK2 Westminster filed a request to garnish her wages from her in-home elder-care job. Five days earlier, Warren had gone to court to fill out a handwritten motion saying she had proof that she was given permission to leave Cove Village in 2010 -- she had finally managed to get a copy from the housing department. "Please give me the opportunity to plead my case," she wrote. But she did not attach a copy of the form to her motion, not realizing it was necessary, so a judge denied it on Jan. 9, on the grounds that there was "no evidence submitted."
The garnishing started that month. Warren was in the midst of leaving her job, but JK2 Westminster garnished her bank account too. After her account was zeroed out, a loss of about $900, she borrowed money from her mother to buy food for her children and pay her bills. That February -- five years after she left Cove Village -- Warren returned to court, this time with the housing form in hand, asking the judge to halt garnishment. "I am a single mom of three and my bank account was wiped clean by the plaintiff," she pleaded in another handwritten request. "I cannot take care of my kids when they snatch all of my money out of my account. I do not feel I owe this money. Please have mercy on my family and I." She told me that when she called the law office representing JK2 Westminster that same day from the courthouse to discuss the case, one of the lawyers told her: "This is not going to go away. You will pay us."
The judge denied Warren's request without explanation. And JK2 Westminster kept pressing for the rest of the money, sending out one process server after another to present Warren with legal papers. Finally, in January 2016, the court sent notice of a $4,615 lien against Warren -- a legal claim against her for the remaining judgment. Warren began to cry as she recounted the episode to me. She said the lien has greatly complicated her hopes of taking out a loan to start her own small assisted-living center. She had gone a couple of years without a bank account, for fear of further garnishing. "It was just pure greed," she said. "It was unnecessary." I asked why she hadn't pushed harder against the judgment once she had the necessary evidence in hand. "They know how to work this stuff," she replied. "They know what to do, and here I am, I don't know anything about the law. I would have to hire a lawyer or something, and I really can't afford that. I really don't know my rights. I don't know all the court lingo. I knew that up against them I would lose."
A search for "JK2 Westminster" in the database of Maryland's District Court system brings back 548 cases in which it is the plaintiff -- and that does not include hundreds of other cases that have been filed in the name of the company's individual complexes.
A vast majority of these cases have been filed by a single small law firm in the Baltimore suburb of Owings Mills. The law office of Jeffrey Tapper specializes in "collections" work, with an emphasis on landlord-tenant cases. It has represented several other real estate management companies, including Sawyer, which retains a stake in many of the Kushner complexes.
In April, I drove to Owings Mills in hopes of speaking to Tapper. As I waited for him by reception, I overheard an assistant making a call about a new case, saying that the firm would continue to pursue one tenant even if the other person on the lease had filed for bankruptcy. Tapper emerged, a man in his mid-60s with white hair, a paunch and a large smartphone clipped to his belt. Our interview was brief. "I'm not having any conversation with you that has to do with one of my clients," he said. "I'm not helping you with any of whatever you're trying to do."
In the cases that Tapper has brought to court on behalf of JK2 Westminster and individual Kushner-controlled companies, there is a clear pattern of Kushner Companies' pursuing tenants over virtually any unpaid rent or broken lease -- even in the numerous cases where the facts appear to be on the tenants' side. Not only does the company file cases against them, it pursues the cases for as long as it takes to collect from the overmatched defendants -- often several years. The court docket of JK2 Westminster's case against Warren, for instance, spans more than three years and 112 actions -- for a sum that amounts to maybe two days' worth of billings for the average corporate-law-firm associate, from a woman who never even rented from JK2 Westminster. The pursuit is all the more remarkable given how transient the company's prey tends to be. Hounding former tenants for money means paying to send out process servers who often report back that they were unable to locate the target. This does not deter Kushner Companies' lawyers. They send the servers back out again a few months later.
In March 2009, Joan Beverly, a probation agent, signed the lease for her daughter, Lennettea, for a unit at Dutch Village, a complex on the northern edge of Baltimore. Lennettea moved out a year later, several months before her lease was up. Kushner Companies bought Dutch Village more than two years later. In December 2012, JK2 Westminster filed suit in Baltimore County District Court against Beverly, seeking $3,810.16 -- several months of rent it said it was owed, plus about $1,000 in repair costs, including $10 for "failure to return laundry room card."
That February, Lennettea filed a written court notice explaining that her mother, who was dying of pancreatic cancer, was "in terminal hospice care and is not eligible to work." She added by way of supporting evidence a letter from the hospice provider to Joan Beverly's bank, explaining her and her husband's late mortgage payments on their home: "There has been added financial stress because Mrs. Beverly is very ill at this time." But JK2 Westminster persisted in seeking a hearing on the suit. In March, a district court judge found in favor of the company -- a total judgment against Joan of more than $5,500.
Joan died two weeks later. Her husband, Tyrone Beverly, a retired longshoreman, requested that the judgment against his deceased wife be removed but was denied. The case remains open in the court database. Tyrone, who was married to Joan for 32 years, told me that he had assumed the judgment had been dismissed and was unaware that it was still listed as awaiting payment. "They just didn't treat us fair," he said.
The sweeping nature of the company's pursuit of tenants was most evident when those tenants were, in fact, prepared to defend themselves. Shawanda Hough moved out of her unit in the Carriage Hill complex in the northwestern Baltimore suburb of Randallstown in early 2012 after black mold worsened her son's asthma, landing him in the hospital twice. After the maintenance crew tried and failed to fix the problem, she got the rental office's written permission to move out in advance of her lease. But then Kushner Companies bought Carriage Hill, and a year and a half later, in August 2013, JK2 Westminster filed a lawsuit against Hough, seeking $4,068.53.
Hough fought back. In a court filing, she said that she had kept all of her documentation, and that the company had assured her that it had not lost a dime in rent; she had gone so far as to coordinate the time of her departure with the arrival of a new tenant. JK2 Westminster went ahead with a hearing before a judge a month later, but the judge ultimately found for Hough.
Cases like Hough's, however, were the exception rather than the rule. Over all, about nine out of every 10 cases brought by JK2 Westminster that I surveyed resulted in judgments against the defendants, who often did not appear in person for the hearings -- and if they did, almost never had legal representation. How could it possibly be worth Kushner Companies' while to pursue hundreds of people so aggressively over a few thousand dollars here and there? After all, the pursuit itself cost money. And it wasn't happening just in Baltimore -- Doug Wilkins, a lawyer in Toledo who has represented some of the complexes bought there by Kushner, told me the company is seeking far more monetary judgments than did previous owners.
When I presented JK2 Westminster's record of litigation to Matthew Cypher, a Georgetown University business professor who used to work for the real estate giant Invesco, he said it was highly unusual to put so much effort into pursuing former tenants in court. "These people fade into the shadows of the night," he said. "It's amazing to me that there's that much to go after." Brian Pendergraft, an attorney in Greenbelt, Md., who works on both sides of landlord-tenant litigation, told me he had heard of large property-management companies pursuing former tenants for unpaid rent but not going so far as to pursue tenants who predated the company's ownership of a complex. "I guess you can do it," he said, "but I don't think it's cool."
But Matthew Hertz, whose Bethesda, Md., firm represents landlords and tenants in similar cases, explained to me that there is a logic behind such aggressive tactics. The costs of the pursuit are not as high as you might imagine, he said -- people are not that hard to find in the age of cellphones and easily accessible databases. "If I give my process server a name and phone number, it's generally enough to trace you," he said. "If I have a date of birth and Social Security number, it's even easier." The legal costs can be billed to the defendant as attorney's fees, if the terms of the lease allow. And garnishing wages is relatively easy to do by court order, assuming the defendant has wages to garnish.
As for pursuing former tenants from years before the new company's ownership of a complex, Hertz said it was hardly different from an investor's buying a portfolio of mortgages: It's debt to be collected on. "If you buy someone's properties, you're buying their debts, not just their assets. You take the good with the bad, and try to collect on the bad. Even if you only get back 5 percent, you're making something," he said. "It's, 'I'm buying up this property and if I can collect anything, it's gravy on top.' "
There was, Hertz added, an ancillary benefit to such relentless pursuit: sending a message to current tenants. One way to make sure that tenants are paying their rent and to keep them from breaking leases early -- which brings with it the costs and hassles of having to clean apartments and find new tenants -- is to instill a sense of fear about violating a lease. "Any landlord takes that into account," Hertz said. "They know tenants are going to talk to each other. If they say, 'He's going to come after you,' it's deterrence."
When Kushner Companies finally responded to my questions about the cases, they essentially affirmed Hertz's reasoning. As manager for the Baltimore complexes, the company had a "fiduciary obligation" to its ownership partners to collect as much revenue as it could, said Kushner Companies' chief financial officer, Jennifer McLean, in a written response. She said the company's legal costs have been "minimal" compared with what it seeks to recover.
McLean declined to comment on several cases, including Kamiia Warren's. But she said the pursuit of Joan Beverly, the woman dying of cancer, was justified. "This tenant owed the landlord $3,819.16," she said in the written statement. "As property manager, it's our job to collect rent payments."
In general, "Westminster Management only takes legal action against a tenant when absolutely necessary," McLean said. "If legal action is pursued, however, the company follows guidelines consistent with industry standards." She added: "While taking a tenant to court is far from an ideal outcome, that option -- and clear rules governing it -- must exist as a last resort."
The Highland Village complex, along the Baltimore-Washington Parkway, is one of Kushner Companies' largest, a vast maze of lanes and courts lined with rows of short brick-and-siding-fronted homes. Like the other Kushner complexes I visited in Baltimore's southern and eastern suburbs, it is situated in what was once a predominantly white working-class community, within reasonable commuting distance of the harbor and industrial plants, now defunct, like Bethlehem Steel. In recent decades, many black transplants from the city and Hispanic immigrants have arrived as well, and Highland Village is an unusually integrated place.
The complex, like the others I saw, seemed designed to preclude neighborliness -- most of the townhouses lack even the barest stoop to sit out on, and at least one complex has signs forbidding ball-playing ("violators will be prosecuted"). At another complex, kids had drawn a rectangle on the side of a storage shed in lieu of a hoop for their basketball game. The only meeting points at many of the complexes are the metal mailbox stands, the Dumpsters and the laundry room. And the only thing that united many of the residents I spoke to, it seemed, was resentment of their landlord.
They complained about Westminster Management's aggressive rent-collection practices, which many told me exceeded what they had experienced under the previous owners. Rent is marked officially late, they said, if it arrives after 4:30 p.m. on the fifth day of the month. But Westminster recently made paying the rent much more of a challenge. Last fall, it sent notice to residents saying that they could no longer pay by money order (on which many residents, who lack checking accounts, had relied) at the complex's rental office and would instead need to go to a Walmart or Ace Cash Express and use an assigned "WIPS card" -- a plastic card linked to the resident's account -- to pay their rent there. That method carries a $3.50 fee for every payment, and getting to the Walmart or Ace is difficult for the many residents without cars.
Tenants who pay after the 5th are hit with late fees that start around $40 to $50 and escalate from there, with court fees usually added on as well. What upsets residents most, though, are not the fees themselves but that the property managers, instead of putting pink or yellow late notices and court summonses discreetly in mailboxes or under doors, post them in public -- on the front doors of townhouse units or on lobby walls or lobby doors of apartment buildings. This bothered even tenants who said they always paid their rent on time. "The whole neighborhood knows," said Marquita Parmely, a truck driver who pays $1,010 a month to rent a townhouse at Essex Park, near Cove Village. Dareck Cromwell, a retiree living at Carriage Hill, told me: "They put them in the windows for everybody to see, to see your business. That's not right. You don't put people's business out like that."
Compounding these grievances was Westminster's maintenance of the properties -- or lack thereof. Their complexes comprise hundreds of units, but typically have only four or so workers looking after them. Alishia Jamesson, a 30-year-old Highland Village resident, invited me into the small living room of the $842-a-month townhouse she and her fiancé share with her two children. The room was cluttered with bags from Walmart and Dollar Tree, ketchup packets and supplies for the work Jamesson took up after she lost her cashier's job at Walmart for missing too many shifts for parenting duties: making personalized tote bags and gift baskets for weddings.
Jamesson showed me three large holes in the walls of the townhouse, which Westminster charged her and her fiancé, Keith Riggs, $150 to fix in October but had not yet repaired. "Every time I ask about drywall they say, 'Oh, well, we only have one drywall person,' " Riggs told me. There was also black mold spreading around the bathtub, a large brown stain and crack on the wall adjacent to the stove and a gap in the bathroom skylight that allowed in rain and snow. Jamesson told me that the refrigerator hadn't worked for more than a month before being replaced; her family had lived on canned food and boxed milk.
Complaints about poor upkeep abounded at the other complexes too. At Highland Village, there was the matter of the vacant unit that burned down one night a couple of months ago: its shell was still standing, attended by nothing but plywood and a tarp. At Essex Park, east of the city, Marquita Parmely, the truck driver, told me she had a mouse infestation that was severe enough that her 12-year-old daughter recently found one in her bed. Parmely also has a 2-year-old with asthma, which is aggravated by allergens in mice droppings. She moved her own bed and other furniture away from the walls to dissuade mice, kept the family's laundry in tote bags after mice started appearing in the hamper and vacuumed twice a day. Her neighbor told me it took weeks for staff members to replace a rear window that had been shot out by kids with a BB gun.
At the Carroll Park complex in Middle River, Md., Jen Jackson showed me a ceiling leak that was causing a mold problem. At the Whispering Woods townhouses nearby, a resident named Nicole, who asked that I not use her last name, told me she had filed unheeded complaints about loose plastic shutters, one of which finally fell off and hit her in the head. (When I visited Nicole again a few weeks later, she told me that Westminster staff had scolded her for speaking with me and told her not to do so again. A large black pickup followed me and a photographer as we walked through the complex until we left.) In the same complex, Renee Cook showed me the large swath of her downstairs ceiling that had collapsed and the mold and mildew beneath the carpet, each resulting from a leak from her neighbor's (illicit) washer-dryer.
Asked about such conditions, Kushner Companies said it follows industry standards for maintenance staffing and exterminator visits, and that it and its partners had spent $10 million on upgrades across the complexes. "Despite those improvements, issues still arise, given the age of the properties," said McLean, the chief financial officer. Shortly after I put questions to the company about specific tenants' complaints, Cook's ceiling was repaired.
The worst troubles may have been those described in a 2013 court case involving Jasmine Cox's unit at Cove Village. They began with the bedroom ceiling, which started leaking one day. Then maggots started coming out of the living-room carpet. Then raw sewage started flowing out of the kitchen sink. "It sounded like someone turned a pool upside down," Cox told me. "I heard the water hitting the floor and I panicked. I got out of bed and the sink is black and gray, it's pooling out of the sink and the house smells terrible."
Cox stopped cooking for herself and her son, not wanting food near the sink. A judge allowed her reduced rent for one month. When she moved out soon afterward, Westminster Management sent her a $600 invoice for a new carpet and other repairs. Cox, who is now working as a battery-test engineer and about to buy her first home, was unaware who was behind the company that had put her through such an ordeal. When I told her of Kushner's involvement, there was a silence as she took it in.
"Get that [expletive] out of here," she said.
Very few of the complex residents I met, even ones who had been pursued at length in court by JK2 Westminster, had any idea that their rent and late fees were going to the family company of the president's son-in-law. "That Jared Kushner?" Danny Jackson, a plumber in his 15th year living at Harbor Point Estates, exclaimed. "Oh, my God. And I thought he was the good one."
Jackson said he voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016. Many of the others I spoke with had not voted -- in that or any other election. "I'm not a big political person, so I feel like I don't think I should vote on something I know nothing about," Alishia Jamesson told me. But eastern Baltimore County was a Trump stronghold, a formerly staunch Democratic territory with many downwardly mobile white voters -- and Kushner's complexes were no exception.
East of the city, I met Chris Freimiller, a 38-year-old resident of the company's Morningside Park complex, who was smoking Newports in his car before heading to work at a Rite Aid distribution center. Freimiller complained to me about the persistent leaks from the toilet and the ceiling damage it had caused, and about being hit repeatedly with late fees. He told me he voted for president for the first time ever last year -- for Donald Trump. His vote, he said, was motivated by "the racial and police issues. How bad it got with Obama and how he seemed to promote the cop-bashing and the racial divide." Did knowing that he was sending his late fees to Trump's son-in-law change anything? "Yeah, actually," he said. "As if they need any more money."
At the Carroll Park complex, I met Mike McHargue, a private investigator, and his girlfriend, Patricia Howell. "They're nothing but slumlords," Howell told me of Westminster Management. "They take everyone's money." When I asked if they knew who was behind the company, they said they did not. "Oh, really?" Howell said when I mentioned Kushner's name. "Oh, really. And I'm a Trump supporter."
Jared Kushner stepped down as chief executive of Kushner Companies in January. But he remains a stakeholder in the company -- his share of company-related trusts is estimated to be worth at least $600 million -- and the company says it has no intention of selling off its multifamily holdings. (JK2 Westminster was formally dissolved in December, but Kushner Companies still owns the complexes through other entities; lawsuits against tenants are now typically filed in the names of the complexes themselves.) Because Kushner retains his interest in the complexes, the White House told The Baltimore Sun in February that he would recuse himself from any policy decisions about Section 8 funding, as many of his tenants rely on it for their rent. But even as Kushner now busies himself with his ever-expanding White House portfolio, his company is carrying on its vigorous efforts in court.
On April 17, three cases were being held consecutively in Baltimore's District Court involving tenants of the Dutch Village complex. One was against Catherine Silver, a Morgan State University student who had given notice that she was moving at the end of March -- she was fed up with lousy maintenance (among other things, a perpetually clogged toilet and a ceiling leak in her closet). But when Silver went to Walmart to pay her March rent with her WIPS card, the money mistakenly ended up not in the account for Dutch Village but the one for Kushner Companies' adjacent complex, Pleasantview.
Westminster Management started eviction proceedings. On March 23, a sheriff's deputy changed the locks on the unit. Silver was traveling at the time -- it was spring break -- and it was not until March 31 that she was able to explain to a judge what happened and get her keys back. By that point, it was too late to get her possessions into the moving truck she'd rented, and classes had resumed. She stayed in the unit, in which Westminster had turned off the heat and hot water, trying again to plan her departure. But Westminster was now after her for April's rent, despite the fact that the company had literally barred her from being able to move before April, as she had intended. On April 25, a judge ruled that she needed to pay half of April's rent, plus court costs: $471.
Westminster had a lawyer from Tapper's firm, Andrew Rabinowitz, at the April 25 hearing, which lasted more than three hours -- all over less than $500. The next day Rabinowitz was back to defend Westminster against Silver's criminal complaint over the unfounded eviction. This time, he was more accommodating, perhaps because he realized a reporter was present. After conferring with Dutch Village's property manager, who was also in attendance, Rabinowitz agreed to let Silver have until the end of May to move out, rent-free, as long as she paid for April. Silver asked if she could have her hot water turned back on. He said he would look into it. But when I visited Silver two weeks later, the hot water was still off. The stove was covered with the pots she was using to boil water for bathing.
On May 10 at the Highland Village complex, a woman was distributing the yellow "failure to pay rent" notices filed with the District Court to tenants who were behind on their May rent. One went up on the door of a man who introduced himself to me as Tommy, a recently divorced house painter with two children, who was at that moment sitting in his pickup truck reading Psalm 91 to gird himself for a visit to traffic court. He said he didn't know why he kept being hit with late fees and court fees at Highland Village because he was up to date on the rent itself.
Over at Carroll Park, Mike McHargue, the private investigator, had also received a yellow notice and was trying to find out when he needed to come up with money to avoid eviction. So was Chris Freimiller, the Rite Aid worker. He had missed a couple weeks of work with back pain related to a metal bar in his leg from an earlier car accident, and Westminster Management had moved quickly to file for eviction over $722.09 in missing rent, plus $66 in fees. When I arrived, Freimiller was sleeping on the couch after a night shift, and his wife, Jaclyn Meador, was trying to get an eviction date from the constable while their 11-year-old son, Ethan, looked on.
One more yellow notice was affixed at the Highland Park home of Alishia Jamesson, the wedding-basket maker. Her fiancé had left his job as a casino housekeeper to take a job handling Amazon packages near the airport, but his first check hadn't come through yet. Jamesson was working at Walmart again. The couple's car tags had expired, so both were enduring long public-transit commutes. No one had come from maintenance. There were still three holes in the wall.

Full text: CORRECTION APPENDED. One morning in mid-December, a group of soldiers banged on the door of a house in eastern Aleppo. A male voice responded from inside: "Who are you?" A soldier answered: "We're the Syrian Arab Army. It's O.K., you can come out. They're all gone."
The door opened. A middle-aged man appeared. He had a gaunt, distinguished face, but his clothes were threadbare and his teeth looked brown and rotted. At the soldiers' encouragement, he stepped hesitantly forward into the street. He explained to them, a little apologetically, that he had not crossed his threshold in four and a half years.
The man gazed around for a moment as if baffled, his eyes filling with tears. The regime of President Bashar al-Assad had just recaptured the city after years of bombing and urban warfare that had made Aleppo a global byword for savagery. This frail-looking man had survived at the war's geographic center entirely alone, an urban Robinson Crusoe, living on stocks of dry food and whatever he could grow in his small inner courtyard. Now, as he stumbled through an alley full of twisted metal and rubble, he saw for the first time that the front lines, marked by a wall of sandbags, were barely 20 yards from his house.
Three months later, in March, he sat with me under the tall, spindly orange tree in his courtyard and described how he barricaded himself in when the fighting started. He goes by the name Abu Sami, and he has the mild, patient manners of a scholar; he taught at Aleppo University before the war. In the early days of the rebel takeover, he said, his nephews used to drop by with fresh bread and meat. But starting in 2013, the shelling grew worse, and he would go six months or more without seeing another human face. There was no water, no electric light; he gathered rainwater in buckets and boiled it and used a small solar panel to charge his phone. He made vinegar from grapes he grew in the courtyard. He treated his illnesses with aloe and other herbs he grew in pots. Once, when a rotten tooth became too painful, he yanked it out with pliers. He cowered by his bed when bombs shook the house to its foundation.
Most of all, he sustained himself by reading. He carried out a stack of books from his bedroom to show me: treatises by Sigmund Freud, novels by Henry Miller, histories of science and psychology and religion and mythology and cooking, a book on radical theater by the American drama critic Robert Brustein. Some were in Russian, a language he learned as a young man. "I read these things so I wouldn't have to think about politics or current events," he said. He read plays -- Shakespeare and Molière were favorites -- and in his solitude, he found that he was able to see the entire drama acted out in his mind, as if it were onstage.
He led me upstairs to see his dusty study, where the walls and ceiling were shredded with dozens of small shrapnel holes that let in fingers of sunlight. He picked up a bomb fragment, rolled it in his palm and laughed. He pointed to the house next door, where his neighbor, a quiet man who kept pigeons on the roof, had lived until a group of rebels arrived, shouting, and dragged him from the door. They brought back his corpse half an hour later.
I asked Abu Sami why he never left. He gave the same answer that so many others gave me: because it was his house. And because day after day, year after year, he kept thinking, Surely this war is about to end.
In the eastern Aleppo streets beyond Abu Sami's house, little has changed since the December morning when he rediscovered his ruined city. A narrow alley leads to an open area where a "hell cannon" still sits, the homemade howitzer used by rebels to fire on government-controlled western Aleppo. Beyond it, there are buildings with pancaked roofs, evidence of Russian and Syrian bombs. There are piles of rubble so high that entire streets remain impassable. Throughout the former rebel zone that once proudly called itself "free Aleppo," there are hospitals and schools and houses -- it goes on for miles -- that have been reduced to uneven heaps of stone and broken concrete, where the faint smell of buried corpses still lingers.
In the United States, the drawn-out siege of Aleppo -- where the Syrian regime and its Russian allies repeatedly bombed hospitals and civilian areas -- was widely deplored as a war crime comparable to the worst massacres of the Bosnian war during the 1990s. The refusal to intervene, some said, was a defining moral failure of the Obama administration. On the other side, regime supporters saw only the rebels' atrocities and their manipulation of civilians for propaganda. The "fall" of Aleppo, they said, was really the "liberation" of a city from terrorist rule, and a sign that Assad had all but won the civil war.
Both portraits are false and self-serving. The Syrian tragedy started in a moment of deceptive simplicity, when the peaceful protesters of the 2011 Arab Spring seemed destined to inherit the future. Chants for freedom turned quickly to insurrection, bullets and war. But it took some time for outsiders to recognize how different Syria was, how its internal schisms -- like tightly coiled springs -- would provoke the fears and ambitions of all its neighbors. The Saudis and Turks wanted to replace Assad with a reliable Sunni client, while Iran and Hezbollah held fast to their one foothold in the Arab world. Russia, which intervened decisively in 2015, had its own motives: flouting American designs and protecting a reliable autocrat. The United States, having expected Assad to fall on his own, dithered over support for the rebels.
Aleppo became the rebels' last major urban redoubt. Its fall reconfigured the Syrian battleground: The Saudis and Turks resigned themselves to Assad's rule, and their rivals exulted in a victory that seemed to justify years of blood and treasure. The Assad regime happily stepped out of the limelight as the world's attention turned back to capturing Raqqa, the ISIS capital in Syria's northeast.
One small measure of the regime's confidence was a renewed willingness to let Western journalists -- including me -- travel the country. I was under the usual police-state surveillance, with a minder from the Information Ministry accompanying me during my travels outside Damascus. But scarcely any Americans had been to Aleppo since the regime's victory in December. The city had become a symbol of sorts, a sprawling commercial hub where every faction seemed to have left its mark. I had been trying to get back there for years; it was a place I loved when I covered the region from Beirut. I wanted to wind back the clock and make sense of how a city that seemed so averse to politics -- of any kind -- had been torn apart.
Even Syrians have trouble answering that question. In March, I met a lawyer named Anas Joudeh, who took part in some of the 2011 protests. Joudeh no longer considers himself a member of the opposition. I asked him why. "No one is 100 percent with the regime, but mostly these people are unified by their resistance to the opposition," Joudeh told me. "They know what they don't want, not what they want." In December, he said, "Syrians abroad who believe in the revolution would call me and say, 'We lost Aleppo.' And I would say, 'What do you mean?' It was only a Turkish card guarded by jihadis." For these exiled Syrians, he said, the specter of Assad's crimes looms so large that they cannot see anything else. They refuse to acknowledge the realities of a rebellion that is corrupt, brutal and compromised by foreign sponsors. This is true. Eastern Aleppo may not have been Raqqa, where ISIS advertised its rigid Islamist dystopia and its mass beheadings. But as a symbol of Syria's future, it was almost as bad: a chaotic wasteland full of feuding militias -- some of them radical Islamists -- who hoarded food and weapons while the people starved.
As for the regime's victory there, it probably would not have taken place if Turkey had not withdrawn some of its rebel proxies to focus on fighting the Kurds. Aleppo may have helped the regime's morale, but the war is likely to grind on for years, sustained and manipulated by outside powers. Assad needs them: His army has been decimated by war and desertions. That may help explain his use of chemical weapons in the town of Khan Sheikhoun in early April, which prompted the Trump administration's slap-on-the-wrist missile strike. With his manpower running out, Assad cares more about reinforcing his rule -- at any cost -- than rehabilitating his reputation in the West, which might have provided loans to help rebuild his shattered country.
All the same, Aleppo was a turning point, and in some ways an emblem of the wider war. Its fall appears to have persuaded many ordinary Syrians that the regime, for all its appalling cruelty and corruption, is their best shot at something close to normality. This is almost certainly true for the Trump administration too. President Trump may call Assad an "animal" and hint at more airstrikes, but he cannot unseat him, because he knows that the alternative is not the kinder, gentler place once dreamed of by opposition activists. It is anarchy, where the warlords rule not from the presidential palace but from every town and every street.
First they stole everything, then they burned everything," Freddy Marrache told me as I stumbled along in the darkness behind him. Above us were vaulted medieval stone roofs, interrupted here and there by huge shell holes. "This was the spice market -- it's totally gone. The front line was just here." Underfoot was a slurry of ash and garbage. Marrache, a 48-year-old businessman with a pale, shaved head and an air of quiet alertness, made frequent visits as a child to Aleppo's Old City. The souqs were its crown jewel, a cloacal maze of market stalls packed with spices, fabrics, silks, leather, soaps, gold, meat, fruit, carpets, toilet seats -- almost anything. It went on for more than eight miles, one of the largest covered markets in the world. Aleppans used to say that a blind man could find his way through them by following the smells of the merchandise. Then, in 2012, the rebels came, and the souqs became the perfect refuge for urban guerrillas.
Marrache and his sister, Marie-Michelle, had offered to show me the remains of the Khan al Nahassine, a grand old house attached to the souqs that was built in 1539 and has been owned by their family since the 1800s. I first saw it a decade earlier, when their mother, Jenny Poche Marrache, walked me through it. She was then in her 60s, and she had a sour elegance that seemed to match the place. I remember her complaining about Islamists as she chain-smoked and concluding acidly in French, "Soon I'll be dead, and it won't matter." She waited patiently as I stared at the parade of antiquities on every wall: paintings, sculptures, documents, old musical instruments, photographs. That house was a shrine to the old Levantine world of which Aleppo -- with its polyglot traders, its mix of Europe and Asia, Christianity and Islam -- had been the center. Jenny died in 2015, before she could see the extent of the damage to the house.
Everything was gone. Even the copper wiring had been stripped out. The walls were still there, but on the far side some rooms had collapsed into the courtyard after heavy shelling. "You remember the painting that was here?" Freddy asked. I did. It was of a woman in Renaissance dress, the wife of the first Venetian consul in Aleppo. (Aleppo still has honorary consulships for many European countries.) The painting was memorable because it was painted in the same room where it hung; you could recognize the other objects and the shape of the wall. Freddy explained that the painting had turned up in Turkey, like much of what the rebels had stolen across Aleppo. An Istanbul antiques dealer told them that he would sell it back to them for $20,000. When they protested that it was stolen, Freddy told me, the dealer said dismissively, "I get things from Syria every day."
Back in the souqs, I kept trying to superimpose my memories of the place. We passed near the silk merchants' area, now blackened and silent. Before 2011, I used to stop there and visit a flamboyant young trader with a round, cherubic face. He would give me tea and drape me with scarves. His little stall was covered with pictures of gay icons like Judy Garland, a reference that his Syrian partners seemed not to get (or perhaps they just didn't care). I still have his business card, with a picture of Oscar Wilde and the quote: "I can resist everything except temptation." Aleppo in those days was a magnet for footloose journalists and adventure tourists. We would spend hours getting lost in the souqs and then stop for drinks in the dimly lit bar at the Hotel Baron, gazing at its old unpaid bar tab left by T.E. Lawrence, our heads swimming with nostalgia for an era we knew only from books.
Now parts of the city were literally unrecognizable. In al-Hatab Square, once one of the prettier spots in the Old City, I found only a giant, uneven mound of rubble and earth that rose 15 feet above the street, with grass growing in it. I almost stepped on an unexploded Turkish gas bomb surrounded by yellow spring flowers. On the square's edges, half the buildings were destroyed. It was hard to believe this was once an orderly urban setting, lined with restaurants and hotels. The last time I was in Aleppo, in late 2010, I stayed at a beautiful old boutique hotel near the square, the Beit Wakil. I remember the owner taking me down into a dark, earthen-walled subbasement to show me a network of tunnels built centuries earlier. You could travel all the way to the citadel -- the great medieval palace that towers over the Old City -- without going aboveground, he said. They were built during the 17th century, when intermittent wars often made streets too treacherous to walk. "Perhaps we will need them again," he said.
What destroyed Aleppo? It was not the sectarianism that is often held up as a key to the Syrian war. It was not just "terrorism," the word used by regime apologists to fend off any share of blame. Those things played a role, but the core of the conflict in Aleppo, as in much of Syria, was a divide between urban wealth and rural poverty. It is not new. Travelers in the Ottoman era used to describe the shocking gulf between Aleppo's opulence and the countryside surrounding it, where peasants lived in almost Stone Age conditions. Later, this divide mapped onto the city itself, as eastern Aleppo spread and filled with poor migrants. Deeply religious and mostly illiterate, smoldering with class resentment, they became the foot soldiers of a violent insurgency led by the Muslim Brotherhood in the 1970s. That rebellion burned for years and culminated in the Syrian regime's notorious massacre of 10,000 to 30,000 people in the city of Hama in 1982. Hundreds of people were killed in Aleppo, too, and a siege atmosphere marked the entire city. The Syrian novelist Khaled Khalifa, who grew up in Aleppo during those years and wrote a novel about it, told me in 2008 that the city's cosmopolitan traditions had helped protect it. But he added: "All this has harmed Syrian society so much. If what happened in the 1980s were to happen again, I think the Islamists would win."
One tragedy of Aleppo is that this rift between rich and poor was slowly mending in the years just before the 2011 uprisings. An economic renaissance was underway, fueled by thousands of small factories on the city's outskirts. The workers were mostly from eastern Aleppo, and the owners from the west. A trade deal with Turkey, whose border is just 30 miles to the north, brought new business and tourists and optimism. I remember sitting at cafe table with two Turkish traders just outside the citadel in late 2009. Tourists thronged all around us, and the two men talked excitedly about how new joint ventures were melting the animosity between their country and Syria. "Erdogan and Assad, they are like real friends," one of them said, referring to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey.
This kind of optimism was one reason the revolution took so long to reach Aleppo. All through 2011, as the rest of Syria erupted in protest, its largest city was quiet. But by 2012, in the villages just beyond the city's edges, weaponry was flowing in from across the Turkish border and battalions were being formed. "The countryside was boiling," I was told by Adnan Hadad, an opposition activist who was there at the time and belonged to the Revolutionary Military Council in Aleppo, a group led by Syrian military officers who defected. The council was eager for more European and American recognition and sensitive to Western calls for the preservation of most of Syria's state institutions. But local rural people tended to side with a more Islamist and less patient group called Liwa al-Tawheed. Tawheed's members "considered themselves more authentic" and had begun getting their own funding from Persian Gulf donors, Hadad told me. In the spring of 2012, Tawheed's members began pushing for a military takeover of Aleppo, accusing the council of excessive caution and even secret deals with the regime. The council resisted, saying they should move only when it was clear that the city's people wanted them to. In July, Tawheed took matters into its own hands. Armed insurgents flooded eastern and southwestern parts of the city, taking over civilian houses as well as police stations in the name of the revolution. Hadad considered the move a "fatal mistake," he told me, and resigned from the military council.
By then, eastern Aleppo had become a rebel stronghold. In early 2013, elections for provincial councils took place, giving the rebels a civilian veneer. But the councils, initially funded by the Syrian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood, were soon under pressure from the Nusra Front, the Syrian Qaeda affiliate, and other hard-line groups. Later, ISIS forces captured parts of the city and forced residents to live by their rigid code. In theory, Aleppo was an embattled showplace for the Syrian revolution's aspirations. In fact, most civilians were dependent on a patchwork of armed rebel factions for food and protection. The constant pressure of war left almost no room for a real economy, and many of the city's factories had been repurposed by the rebels as military bases.
Now Aleppo's great economic engine lies in ruins. One afternoon, a 45-year-old factory owner named Ghassan Nasi took me to the industrial area just west of Aleppo called Layramoon. The sounds of the city dissipated as we drove west, and when the car stopped, there was an eerie silence. An entire district that once hummed with 1,000 small factories was now abandoned, most of its buildings shattered and burned. "It is a 100 percent loss here," Nasi said. We walked down a dusty street to his factory, a textile and dyeing house that employed 130 people who worked 24 hours a day in three shifts. The door still had its metal filigree gate and marble steps. "This is where workers stamped in and out," he said.
Inside, the huge factory floor was burned black and strewn with rubble. The rebels had used it to make weapons, he said. His old office had been used to house prisoners. Nasi told me quietly that he collapsed to his knees upon seeing it again last summer. "I lost $10 million in machinery, $4 million in land," he said. "Even if we rebuild, the machinery is gone, and with the sanctions, we cannot buy new machinery." On top of that, there is inflation: The American dollar was worth 47 Syrian pounds before the crisis, and now it trades unofficially at about 520. And Turkey -- where much of the Aleppo factories' machinery was transported and sold, often with the collusion of Syrian owners who wanted to avoid losing everything -- now sells similar textiles for less. Reviving Syrian industry, and the social glue it might once have provided, is next to impossible.
I asked Nasi what had become of his workers. He said about 70 percent of them joined the rebels. He didn't seem bitter or surprised about this. Some lived nearby, so when the area was divided, they had little choice. As for the others, they were poor and ill educated and religious, and the rebels promised them a lot. "The average salary for workers was about a hundred dollars a week," he said. "The rebels paid more."
For many Aleppans, caught up in a conflict they had tried to avoid, the only rule was survival. On a warm spring morning in 2013, a 22-year-old man named Yasser lay bleeding in the middle of a street in eastern Aleppo. Moments earlier, he had carried his mother, mortally wounded by a sniper, into his grandparents' car. As he watched the car pull away, three bullets struck his legs and left arm. He collapsed into the street and could not move. Shots rang out over his head: regime soldiers trading fire with rebels on either side of him. The soldiers heard Yasser calling for help and told him to come toward them. "I can't move," he shouted. Then a rebel spoke from a nearby building, promising to help. When he answered, a regime soldier called out, "Who are you talking to?" The rebels quickly warned him not to answer or they would kill him.
"I was very scared of both sides," Yasser told me later. "If I went to one side, the other would kill me." He lay there, his limbs going numb, too frightened to move or speak for more than four hours.
I met Yasser in March in Sha'ar, the most devastated neighborhood in eastern Aleppo. He was short and solidly built, with a snub nose and a gruff manner. He was selling tomatoes and cucumbers from a stand, on a block where many buildings were in ruins. Across the street was a fruit stand, and next to it, a loud generator, set up by the government to supply electricity. Surprising numbers of people walked the streets. This place had been almost completely empty a few weeks earlier, but now that Russian mine-clearing teams had been through and the rubble was mostly pushed aside, Sha'ar's residents were returning to their homes. (More than 100,000 went back to eastern Aleppo between January and March, according to the International Organization for Migration.) Yasser said he was one of the first people to come back, right after what he -- like everyone else I met -- called the liberation. It was a gesture of defiance, aimed at the rebels. "What we lost, we will get it back," he said. He wore military fatigues, and he told me he re-enlisted in the military after he got out of the hospital in 2013. "My blood type is O-Assad," he said.
Later, Yasser showed me the place where he was wounded. It was the first time he'd been back since it happened, and the block had changed, like most of eastern Aleppo. "There was a checkpoint here, there were sandbags there," he said. He pointed out the first-floor window where an old man had talked to him through curtains as he lay on the street. He showed me the building where he thought the sniper had been hiding, about 100 yards away. He explained how his ordeal had ended: An airstrike hit the building, and the sniper vanished. A man on a motorbike rescued Yasser, carrying him to a house, where someone cleaned his wounds. Later, he was taken to a hospital, where a doctor told him that his mother was dead. The doctor put a needle in his arm and told him to count to three, and he blacked out.
I found Yasser's story credible, and his uncle later backed it up. But as I stood on the street with him, I found myself wondering: Did he really know who shot him? Bullets were coming from each side. As he lay there bleeding, whom was he more frightened of -- the rebels or the regime? Yasser clearly knew how his government is portrayed in the West and seemed defensive about it. He told me a rebel group tried to blame the regime for his mother's death. Later, he said, the same group admitted its guilt and offered blood money, which the family refused to take. This seemed less plausible. He walked me down the street to his uncle's house, where he said we would hear another story about what the rebels had done.
Yasser's uncle was a big, heavyset man with a jowly face and a look of weary resignation in his eyes. He welcomed us into his tiny apartment, where he offered me a stool and sat down on his old brass bed. He sighed and apologized for being unable to offer us tea. Then he showed us his scarred arm and told us the story of how his family was devastated in January 2013. He was driving his pregnant daughter to the hospital when machine-gun fire riddled the car, killing his wife instantly and wounding everyone else. He told me rebels from the Free Syrian Army pulled them from the car and rushed them to a nearby hospital. I asked who fired on them. "I don't know," he said.
There was a silence. Until that moment, I had not heard anyone miss an opportunity to blame the rebels. With my government minder looking on, Yasser began asking where the gunfire had come from. Wasn't it from a tall building nearby? Weren't the rebels in that building? The uncle shrugged. "I don't know," he said again. I had the impression that he was profoundly depressed and past caring about what he was supposed to say. Yasser kept pressing. Eventually, the uncle caved in and said, Sure, it was probably the rebels. "My wife died a martyr," he said. "For the F.S.A., I cannot say, because they helped me and my wife. I cannot say how they are with other people." And then quietly, he began to cry.
There is a billboard hanging over one of Aleppo's main intersections that shows a soldier wearing a helmet, with his entire face shrouded in shadow. Beneath it are the words "Aleppo in Our Eyes." The image stuck with me. Which Aleppo? Whose eyes? In Arabic, the expression conveys affection, but the words also seemed to hint at the city's fragmented loyalties, its atmosphere of enduring suspicion. It wasn't just regime allegiance that made people like Yasser tailor their stories. He refused to be photographed, and when I asked why, he hinted that the rebels might still be able to find and kill him, even after the regime's triumph. Another man described receiving a visit at his home in government-controlled Aleppo from two ISIS members, who calmly blackmailed him and went on their way, unhurried. The city had changed hands so many times that no one could be fully confident whose eyes would be watching them.
On my second day in the city, I went to see the Aleppo Eye Hospital, a sprawling compound that the rebels had used as a military headquarters. As we walked through the burned and shattered building, my government minder and the soldiers guarding the place kept picking up markers of the rebels' Islamist leanings. They weren't hard to find. A fire-blackened car out front still had the Qaeda logo on its hood. Inside, the rebels had put up paper signs to show how they used the rooms: a room where Shariah rulings were handed out by a religious sheikh, a document about Islamic punishments. There was a prison too, and I later met a woman who seems to have been kept there. She had been captured in a rural village, and the rebels killed her husband and then moved her from place to place, intending to trade her for their own prisoners. There were female jailers who beat and cursed her and called her an infidel. She told me she was given a bottle of water to wash herself with once every 10 to 15 days. During the final battle for Aleppo, she often heard the sounds of bombs and mortars exploding nearby, and her jailers would taunt her, saying Assad's bombs will kill you.
As I walked through those ruins, it was clear enough that the rebels who ruled eastern Aleppo had done some awful things there. Yet the whole hospital tour was designed, at least in part, to mitigate or obscure a very uncomfortable fact. The Assad regime repeatedly and deliberately bombed hospitals in the rebel zone, even when there was no reason to suspect that fighters were based there. No one would discuss this with me during my time in Aleppo, even when I did not have the minder with me. Instead, I had to speak to people who fled eastern Aleppo under the terms of the deal to evacuate the city in December, when the regime recaptured it. They were living in Idlib province, to the southwest, which is held by rebels, and I spoke to them by Skype. One was a young man who worked as a nurse at the Omar bin Abdul Aziz Hospital throughout 2016. He told me that the hospital was rendered inoperable 15 times by regime airstrikes. Each time, engineers and doctors would rehabilitate it, only to see it damaged again. When the regime soldiers got too close, they moved to another hospital, called Al Quds. It was so crowded that they sometimes tended the wounded in the street outside.
Stories like this have been amply documented and held up as evidence that the Assad regime is guilty of war crimes on a wide scale. A nongovernmental organization in Europe has been working for years to gather documents that would tie the Syrian leadership to these crimes in a Nuremberg-style trial. That prospect is remote, but there are signs that Assad, too, may be worried about whose eyes are watching him. This month, the State Department released satellite photographs suggesting that the regime is burning the bodies of executed prisoners in a crematory at the Sednaya prison complex, north of Damascus, in an alleged effort to hide evidence. The Syrian regime called these charges a "new Hollywood plot."
One afternoon, I was sitting in an Aleppo cafe with a 26-year-old man who had just got out of the army after six years. He served all over the country and had shrapnel wounds on his legs and back. His cellphone rang, and I watched his eyes widen as he absorbed what was obviously bad news. When he got off the phone, he told me that six friends from his old unit had just been killed in Jobar, a suburb of Damascus. The rebels had launched a complex attack using tunnels and multiple suicide bombers. All in all, about 30 regime soldiers had been killed. That attack was the start of a rebel offensive that reached the edge of Damascus's Old City, keeping residents awake much of the night with deafening blasts. The rebels mounted simultaneous assaults to the north, forcing the roads to close for days. I had my own minor brush with the rebel campaign. As I was driving from Aleppo to the Syrian coast, rebels opened fire on the road to our right as we passed near the city of Homs. A soldier yelled at us to move fast, and our driver gunned the engine -- we must have hit 100 miles an hour on a tiny two-way road -- and told us to duck our heads. The rebels were just a hundred yards away. I heard their shellfire thumping in the distance almost everywhere I went.
It is impossible to live in government-controlled Syria without noticing that there are almost no young men on the street. They are in the army, or they are dead. Veterans must carry their military papers with them or risk on-the-spot re-enlistment. At one checkpoint, government soldiers tried to grab the young Spanish photographer I was working with, who is easily mistaken for a Syrian; they wanted to recruit him. In Latakia, a beach town in the regime's northwestern heartland, I met a 53-year-old businessman named Munzer Nasser, who commands a militia composed almost entirely of older men; there are no young men left in his village. One of its members, he told me, is a 65-year-old whose three sons have all been killed in the war. Behind the Assad regime's atrocities lies a fear of demographic exhaustion. Its rebel opponents have no such worries: They can draw on a vast well of Islamist sympathizers across the Arab world.
These facts translate into a genuine gratitude -- in regime-controlled areas -- toward Russia, whose military intervention in late 2015 may have forestalled a total collapse. Many Syrians say they feel reassured by the sight of Russian soldiers, because they (unlike the army and its allied militias) are not likely to loot or steal. Some of my contacts in regime-controlled areas are even learning Russian. In Latakia, some people told me that their city might have been destroyed if not for the Russians. The city has long been one of Syria's safe zones, well defended by the army and its militias; there are tent cities full of people who have fled other parts of the country, including thousands from Aleppo. But in the summer of 2015, the rebels were closing in on the Latakia city limits, and mortars were falling downtown. If the rebels had captured the area -- where Alawites are the majority -- a result would almost certainly have been sectarian mass murder. Many people in the region would have blamed the United States, which armed some of the rebels operating in the area. In this sense, the Russian intervention was a lucky thing for the Obama administration too. Andrew Exum, who worked in the Pentagon at the time, told me that the military drew up contingency plans for a rapid collapse of the regime. The planning sessions were talked about as "catastrophic success."
Yet Assad's popularity is due not only to his role as the guarantor of a secular order. He has also cannily positioned himself as a unique guardian against his own regime. Just before I arrived in Aleppo in March, a high-ranking Republican Guard commander in the city issued a public order declaring a crackdown on "acts of looting, robbery and assaults on public property and on the freedoms of citizens and their private property." The order was a belated recognition of what had been going on for months: an orgy of looting by the various paramilitary groups that work alongside the Syrian Army, and even by elements of the army itself.
I heard complaints about this everywhere I went. Looting has become so common that it has generated a new word: ta'feesh, to steal furniture. One reporter for the regime-friendly TV channel Al Mayadeen said in a November interview that "this systematic looting has exceeded all limits to include murder as well as stealing and looting." He went on to describe a "rigorously organized" process in which the paramilitary groups followed the Syrian Army and pillaged at will, sometimes "dragging homeowners from their houses and robbing the houses right in front of their eyes." Another common tactic, he said, was to pour gasoline on walls and set a fire "until the tiles on the floors and walls expand due to the heat. Then they put out the fire, remove the tiles and resell them."
The reporter, an Aleppan named Rida al-Basha, described the neighborhoods where this had taken place and named the militias, including the notorious Tiger Forces, whose leaders include well-known thugs. At the end of the interview, Basha said that he had pleaded with the city government and other journalists to expose these crimes, but that everyone was too frightened. After the report, Basha repeatedly said he was threatened with death, and he is said to have fled the country.
Publicly, the Syrian state deplores these crimes, but privately it seems to condone them as a form of compensation for the paramilitary groups, whose support Assad needs to supplement his decimated army. (The rebels do it, too, and sometimes offer an Islamic justification: ghana'im al-harb, the spoils of war.) Only when the looting starts to spin out of control, as it did in Aleppo in January and February, is there a crackdown. But such systematized thievery has become entrenched in an economy that is more corrupt than ever. Regime-allied armed groups often set up checkpoints and extort taxes from farmers and businessmen, making it that much harder to earn a living. "You pay through the nose to transport anything anywhere," I was told by a man who manufactures plastics and has seen most of his profit margin disappear. "Bashar can't do anything about this. He is in survival mode." Meanwhile, war profiteers (tujjar al-harb -- another phrase you hear a lot in Syria nowadays) have become well-known figures. I was amazed to see new, lavish-looking restaurants in Damascus; some of them belong to men who are said to have grown rich from crime. Members of the old Damascus business elite wince when they describe the clientele in these places. One friend told me, "You see a guy in a business suit in a fancy bar talking to a thuggish-looking guy in fatigues, and you understand the conversation without hearing anything." Some of these men are also widely said to sell oil to rebel groups for huge profits.
Late last year, Iran abruptly suspended oil deliveries, which have become a lifeline for Syria. Iran acted because it was angry about the amount of its fuel that was being diverted and sold to rebels by regime-connected middlemen, I was told by a Syrian who has close ties to Hezbollah, Iran's ally. The suspension created a serious fuel crisis in winter. Iran resumed its supplies in mid-February, but Tehran has little choice: It needs Assad as much as he needs it. There are reports of similar tensions with the Russians, who are more interested in brokering an end to the fighting than Assad is. The Syrian businessman put it like this: "Bashar is like a man with two false legs -- one is Russia and one is Iran. He keeps hopping from one leg to the other, because the ground he is standing on is very hot."
All this may sound awfully precarious for Assad. But in a sense, it is just a more extreme form of the game Assad and his father have played for decades. The Assad regime arose after an unstable period during the 1950s and '60s, when Syria was shaken by coups and countercoups. Hafez al-Assad, Bashar's father, triumphed in part by managing a constellation of rivals who hated one another but were all dependent on him. They knew that without him at the center, chaos would return, and that would be bad for business. This is truer than ever today. And it has a secondary effect, not unimportant: Many ordinary people now see Assad as their only hedge against a far more toxic kind of chaos.
My Syrian businessman friend told me that he twice gathered about a dozen people for dinner and offered them a hypothetical in strict confidence. It is up to you to name the next president of Syria, he said. Whom would you choose? The guests were all Syrians, and none supported the regime. To his surprise, almost all of them named Assad. When he asked why, the same answer came back again and again: Assad is the only one who can protect us against his own devils.
While I was in Syria, I found myself thinking now and again about the vast street demonstrations I saw in Iran in 2009. This was just after the disputed re-election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as president, when millions of people marched peacefully through the streets of Tehran. The crowd drew from every social class, every generation. A peaceful popular movement seemed to have brought the theocratic regime to its knees. Soon after the largest march, on June 15, the police and the Basij militia came out in force, spraying tear gas and beating people with truncheons. Protests went on for months, but eventually they dwindled to a hard core, and the regime crushed the movement with relative ease. I often wondered about all those people I saw in the streets on June 15. At the time, their absence felt a bit like cowardice to me. Now it feels more like a kind of earned political wisdom. They stayed home not because they preferred the regime but because they did not want to risk death. And perhaps because they did not want to see their country torn apart.
Anas Joudeh, the Damascus lawyer, told me that the absence of this kind of wisdom is precisely what doomed Syria. For years, he said, he and his friends cast around looking for someone to blame for the failure of the 2011 revolution. "We often asked, If only this, or if only that," he said. "But now I feel that what happened was destiny. Because there are no political or social forces in Syria. The regime emptied them out. So when the regime looked to make a deal in 2011, there was no one there." I took Joudeh to be saying that the regime might have been willing to share power, in some limited way, if the opposition had been more organized, more conciliatory. Perhaps it is naïve to suggest that the regime could have offered genuine reforms of its own accord. Police states are not known for voluntarily giving up power in the interest of building a better future. Assad has spoken the language of reform ever since he inherited his role from his father in 2000, and he has never followed through on any of it. Still, there is one story that has haunted me.
On March 30, 2011, Assad delivered a televised speech to Syria's rubber-stamp Parliament that is widely viewed in retrospect as a crucial step in the country's descent into war. He had kept silent during the previous two weeks of protest and violence. Some of his advisers and proxies had hinted, in the days beforehand, that he would make historic proposals, offering a hand to the protesters and paving the way for genuine national reconciliation. Much of the region tuned in as Assad walked up a red carpet into the Parliament building past a cheering crowd. But his speech quickly turned into a familiar, embarrassing spectacle, with lawmakers chanting his name and interrupting his speech with fawning accolades. Assad delivered a hard-line speech deriding the protesters as dupes of a foreign-backed plot to destroy the country. He closed on an ominous note, saying: "There is no compromise or middle way in this. What is at stake is the homeland, and there is a huge conspiracy. ... We have never hesitated in defending our causes, interests and principles, and if we are forced into a battle, so be it."
One former regime official told me that he recalls watching the speech with a sense of shock and dismay. He and other high-ranking officials had heard in advance the details of what the speech was supposed to say. It had been drafted, they were told, by Vice President Farouk al-Shara, and it emphasized reconciliation with the protesters. Shara had received input from several other top officials with similar inclinations. This version of the speech even had the support of Hezbollah's leaders, who believed that genuine gestures of compromise could head off a war, the former official said. Other people close to the regime have echoed this account, though there are analysts who are skeptical; it's almost impossible to be sure about what happens in Assad's secretive inner circle.
What is certain is that Assad did not deliver the speech that was expected. Instead, the former official said, he scrapped it at the last minute in favor of a much more aggressive text. "When I heard the speech, my feeling was -- we are in for a long fight," the former official told me. "I was in my office. We looked around at each other and did not say a word." He remains convinced that if Assad had given the other speech, the past six years would have unrolled very differently, and oceans of blood might have been spared.
Few people in Syria have any patience for this kind of wistful talk. Former regime critics like Joudeh now confine themselves to pressing for the smallest-bore reforms: better training for the police and judiciary, more local control in towns and cities, a diminished role for the Baath Party and its outmoded Arab Nationalist bromides. But even this will not happen while the war continues, and it may be even less likely afterward. Assad has a genius for corrupting everyone around him, in ways large and small (some of his advisers are said to be receiving land in bombed-out rebel areas). Even giving in to these mild measures of hope can start to make you feel dirty, as if you had been played for a fool. The alternative, of course, is an ecumenical cynicism toward everyone and everything. This is the default mentality for most Syrians I know.
In my time in Syria, I met one person who seemed to evade both of these traps. I hesitate to use the word "hero," because he would violently reject it. But he held onto a dogged civic idealism that was divorced from hope of any kind. In a sense, he was the inverse of Abu Sami, the professor who shut himself off from the war inside his home. He was a 57-year-old engineer named Tarif Attora, who appeared to be working himself to death running a group called the Aleppo People's Initiative. He and his teams repair water pipes and electricity lines and supply food and medical aid to people in need. They do this in both regime and rebel areas, unlike the White Helmets, the rescue group that was lionized in an Academy Award-winning documentary. He is the only person I know who has the unreserved admiration of both rebel leaders and die-hard regime loyalists.
I met Attora in the initiative's office, where he sat at a battered desk with a vast map of the city -- east and west -- on the wall behind him. The desk was covered with stacked files and old coffee mugs, and he interrupted our talk several times to bark instructions to site managers. ("Don't strain the lines. You're getting 50. It should be 25 to 30.") He has steel-gray hair that is cut short and flat on the top of his head, and his face -- stark, creased with vertical lines, square-jawed -- looks a bit like Albert Camus's might have if he lived a decade longer.
The initiative started in July 2012, when Attora gathered roughly 30 engineers and other professionals -- all Aleppo residents -- to talk about how they could help protect the city. Some were with the opposition, some were not, and there were arguments. They agreed on one thing: the need to keep the lights on and the water running. So they asked the authorities for permission and began reaching out to all the rebel groups. Soon they had hundreds of volunteers working with them and repair crews going everywhere, even the front lines. The state water company supplied pipes and materials, but apart from that, the initiative is entirely self-funding, Attora said. Six of its members have been killed. Many others have been wounded, including Attora.
He told me several harrowing stories about his work in what he called "hot zones." Twice he came close to being killed, and his back is now broken in two places. Jihadi groups were in control of Aleppo's main power plant for more than a year, so he ended up dealing with them a lot. Once, he saw something that left him traumatized for months. He asked me not to report the details, because it might anger the people involved and limit his ability to work with them. Despite the trauma -- which still haunts him -- he did not want to jeopardize his ability "to continue working in all areas," he said.
I asked Attora why he does it, and he hesitated. He seemed uncomfortable dealing with abstractions. "Freedom doesn't come from destroying the country," he said as he put out what must have been his 10th cigarette since our conversation started and lit another. "Look, people consider me opposition," he said. "But the way I see opposition -- it doesn't mean I must destroy my country and put us back 100 years. That kind of opposition is a betrayal of the country, a betrayal of the ideals I've grown up with."
He seemed unsatisfied with his words, and he glanced around the room, as if he were looking for an excuse to stop talking and get back to his engineers. It was getting dark outside. "We all served the politics of other countries in our own land, whether we knew it or not," he said. "Everybody has to wake up. To be brave, to admit they've made mistakes, to come back to the right way."
I stood up to shake Attora's hand and say goodbye. His face cracked into a smile, and the phone rang. He picked it up, and instantly he was at home again, supervising repairs on a power line that would probably be blown up again tomorrow.

Expecting Big Bump in the U.S. Economy This Year? Signs Suggest It's Less Likely

Full text: The big economic bounce that some experts have confidently predicted for later in the year may turn out to be only a small bump. It is not that the economy is weakening, or that a recession is in the offing. Rather it appears as if the pace of growth in 2017 will not be much faster than it was last year, or the year before that.
So even as the Commerce Department on Friday offered an upward revision of the first-quarter growth rate -- to 1.2 percent from the 0.7 percent cited last month -- other forecasters were lowering their sights for the current quarter.
The expectations have dipped amid fears of lackluster consumer spending and orders for durable goods, and new data on Thursday that showed a larger-than-anticipated trade deficit in April.
Instead of 4.1 percent growth in the second quarter, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta's widely followed GDPNow model now calls for a 3.7 percent rate. And the New York Fed reduced its rival Nowcasting estimate slightly to 2.1 percent. In March, that forecast stood at 3 percent.
Despite the slight erosion in expectations recently, the job market has remained strong, pushing the unemployment rate down to 4.4 percent last month. As a result, the Federal Reserve Board is expected to raise interest rates twice more this year, with traders betting that the next increase will come in June.
In other words, the so-called new normal -- steady but not spectacular growth that never reaches escape velocity -- is beginning to resemble the old normal.
"We're still on track for a 2 percent growth economy, give or take a little, but not a 3 percent economy," said Diane Swonk, a veteran independent economist in Chicago. "It may not sound like much, but the difference is important."
In a $17 trillion economy, it is a difference of $170 billion per year, which has major implications for corporate profits, worker pay and even the federal government's bottom line.
The budget proposal released this week by the Trump administration assumes growth of about 3 percent annually, and President Trump has talked about annual growth of 4 percent or even more.
Neither figure is realistic, given the country's aging population, and low growth in productivity, Ms. Swonk said.
"Those two factors make for headwinds that are hard to overcome," she said. Although the kind of annual gains that Mr. Trump has targeted were achieved in the mid-2000s and the late 1990s, the economy's underlying potential is not as strong now than it was then.
"It's like trying to use old road maps in a GPS world," Ms. Swonk said. "We need to acknowledge that."
Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco, has not had to lower his expectations for the current quarter. That is because he has been considerably less optimistic than many of his peers, with a forecast of roughly 3 percent.
"I've been below consensus for a while," Mr. Anderson said, citing the likelihood of weaker spending by businesses. "There's not a lot of visible growth drivers outside of consumer spending and rebuilding inventories."
"Everyone is hanging their hat on stronger consumer spending, but there's a lot of uncertainty there," he added, noting that data expected next week on personal income and spending would be an important indicator of how consumption is shaping up.
Besides tempering expectations for the broader economy, traders appear to be discounting the likelihood of major tax cuts or a burst of infrastructure spending this year, judging by a recent drop in bond yields.
Yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond, which move inversely to price, were 2.25 percent on Friday, down from 2.6 percent in March. Investors tend to buy bonds when economic activity and the risk of inflation ease, and pare back as growth quickens.
The inquiries into possible dealings with the Russian government by associates of Mr. Trump, and conflicts among Republicans in Congress, may further stymie any big stimulus from Washington.
"We haven't built any stimulus into our projections for 2017, and the way I'm seeing things, possibly not in 2018 either," said Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist for Northern Trust in Chicago. "The dissonance in the Republican caucus is such that it will be hard for them to reach consensus."
Given at least a modest uptick this quarter after the year's weak start, Mr. Tannenbaum is looking for growth in the first half of 2017 to average about 2 percent.
While lower than many experts and consumers would like, that is still slightly higher than the growth rate in Germany, the largest economy in the eurozone.
Growth of around 2 percent is also what economists like Mike Gapen at Barclays expect for all of this year and next.
Typically, quarterly data is volatile, but in recent years, first-quarter growth estimates have been especially unpredictable. This year, as was true in 2014 and 2011, growth appears to have been very weak in the first quarter. Experts expect a rebound in subsequent quarters in 2017, as happened in those previous years.
Early this year, output was also reduced slightly by warm temperatures in many parts of the United States, slowing demand for energy from utilities.
One key indicator for the current quarter will come on Thursday, when the latest monthly data for auto sales is released. Slightly lower car sales reduced growth by about 0.4 percentage points in the first quarter, Mr. Gapen said.
On an annual basis, demand for cars has been running just over 17 million. If the number sinks below that threshold, expectations may have to be adjusted downward again for the second quarter, which ends on June 30.
On the other hand, Mr. Gapen noted that Asia, Europe and other markets are finally growing in sync with the United States, rather than there being rotating global weak spots.
"We don't have a problem child," he said. "In previous years, it was the fiscal cliff in the U.S., or debt fears in Europe or a hard landing in China. Global growth is more synchronized, without any individual pillars showing weakness."

When Politics Roils Market, Tuning Out May Pay Off

Full text: The United States stock market shuddered last week on a report that President Trump had tried to stop an F.B.I. investigation of his former national security adviser, with the Dow Jones industrials falling 373 points in one day and drawing comparisons to the Watergate-era bear market. If you think politics is roiling United States markets, consider Brazil: The day after the Trump-induced turmoil on United States exchanges, the Brazilian market fell 10 percent and trading had to be halted after news of a bribery scandal engulfed its relatively new president, Michel Temer.
In France, investors were relieved that the centrist Emmanuel Macron decisively defeated the far-right National Front leader, Marine Le Pen. An upset Le Pen victory would very likely have made the market reaction to Britain's decision to leave the European Union last summer look tame. The so-called Brexit vote sent European stocks down 7 percent the day after the surprise outcome.
In a period of otherwise extended market calm, geopolitics have been driving periodic bouts of volatility. Even small investors have been making bets on the impact politics can have on stocks and other asset classes. After last week's sell-off, I got a wave of questions from people asking whether Mr. Trump might be impeached and if they should sell stocks.
I obviously can't answer the first question. As for selling stocks, my answer, as it has been consistently since the election, is "no," at least not because of the troubles swirling around the president.
Consider what has happened in the days since the headline-making news. By the middle of this week, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index had recovered virtually everything it lost after the Trump-Russia news broke, and on Thursday it closed at a new high.
Brazil's Bovespa index regained much of the ground it lost last week and was in positive territory for the year to date.
Within a month of Brexit, European stocks had recovered nearly all their losses. This year European stock markets have been notching new highs.
Even some of Wall Street's most famous and successful investors have been struggling this year to turn political upheaval into market gains. Paulson & Company and Soros Fund Management, two of the best-known global macro hedge funds, which make bets on geopolitical events, lost billions last year according to an annual hedge fund ranking compiled by LCH Investments. Paul Tudor Jones's Tudor Investment, another macro fund, was flat, and Mr. Jones recently told investors he's taking on more risk and shifting to more quantitative strategies in an effort to enhance performance.
A macro hedge fund index compiled by Hedge Fund Research is down nearly 1 percent since Jan. 1 and over 4 percent for the last 12 months, one of the worst performing hedge fund indexes. Meanwhile, the S.&P. 500 gained almost 10 percent in 2016 and is up more than 7 percent this year.
By and large, "investors should tune out political events," said James B. Stack, president of InvesTech Research and Stack Financial Management, who has done a study of what he calls "crisis events" and their effect on markets. "Historically speaking, and as a seasoned investor, I'd say investors should just ignore geopolitical events like Brexit or whatever is happening in Brazil."
The problem, Mr. Stack's research has found, is that "geopolitical events may be widely feared, and there will often be a knee-jerk market reaction when they're unexpected, but seldom do they have a lasting impact. Underlying economic trends and monetary policy are far more important."
Markus Schomer, chief economist at the asset manager PineBridge Investments, made a similar point. As fundamental investors with longer time horizons, "we try not to be distracted by the political noise," he said. "I've been telling even our traders with shorter time horizons that what we're seeing doesn't really affect the economy or monetary policy, which is more important for markets than anything else."
Mr. Stack noted that stocks declined sharply after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. But the bear market and recession that followed the technology bubble that exploded in 2000 were already well underway by then. September 2001 turned out to be an unusually bad time to sell stocks: By New Year's Day 2002, little more than three months after the post-9/11 low reached on Sept. 21, the S.&P. 500 had gained close to 20 percent.
A more recent example was the showdown over the federal debt ceiling in 2011, when Standard & Poor's downgraded United States government securities for the first time amid fears the government might default on its debt. "Stocks dropped 15 percent in less than two months and we were on the brink of a bear market," Mr. Stack said. "Once the crisis was resolved, stocks came roaring back," and had regained all their losses by year-end.
Of 11 major geopolitical events examined by Mr. Stack's firm, only two -- the Nazi invasion of France in May 1940, and Japan's bombing of Pearl Harbor in December 1941 -- led to market losses over one-week, three-month and one-year periods (and in the case of Pearl Harbor, the one-year decline was less than 1 percent).
President John F. Kennedy's assassination had no discernible impact: Stocks were up more than 20 percent a year later.
As geopolitical crises go, those were pretty big shocks to markets and investor psychology. So far, nothing in the Trump administration has come close. Still, expectations that Mr. Trump and a Republican Congress would succeed in enacting business- and shareholder-friendly tax and regulatory changes are part of what has driven recent market gains.
Mr. Stack noted that measures of confidence among small businesses, chief executives and consumers are at or near record levels. "There's no doubt that expectations have accelerated since the election," he said. "So the question is whether political turmoil will turn those expectations upside down," leading to a loss of confidence and lower consumer spending. That could happen, but so far, "we're not seeing any evidence of that," he said.
He said comparisons to the Watergate-era bear market of 1973-74 were off base, because then the country was in recession, the Arab oil crisis sent gasoline prices surging, inflation was raging and interest rates hit record highs. Arguably, President Richard M. Nixon's abandonment of the gold standard and the transition to market-determined currency exchange rates had more to do with plunging stock prices than his crumbling presidency.
Mr. Schomer said a failure to act upon many of Mr. Trump's spending and tax proposals might not be such a bad thing for markets, given that the United States economy is already at or close to full employment and doesn't need additional stimulus. "At the end of the day, the only reason we'll have a recession is if the Fed is forced to raise interest rates too quickly, unless we have a massive crisis, which I don't see happening," he said.
If anything, history suggests that long-term investors should buy stocks after markets fall on bad geopolitical news, not sell. But that's not to say this time won't prove to be an exception, or that markets won't correct for other reasons.
Whatever happens with President Trump, the United States is in the ninth year of the second-longest bull market since World War II; none have made it past 10 years. Valuations are getting stretched. Sooner or later, there will be another correction, and eventually a bear market.
Nonetheless, Mr. Schomer says he sees no imminent end to the bull market. "We're not going to see a 25 percent surge this year, but this economic cycle is so slow and steady with so few imbalances, we could end up with 8 to 10 percent gains the next few years and a much greater degree of overvaluation."
For his part, Mr. Stack said: "We still believe this market will hit new highs in 2017, but the low volatility and the high valuations suggest this is not a low-risk market. It's not a market in which you should be investing large sums of new capital."

Full text: EFFINGHAM, Ill. -- The vast Petro truck stop here is a neon-lit, blacktop oasis at the crossroads of America. It beckons big-rig drivers with showers, laundry machines, a barber shop, even a knife store. "Professional drivers only," reads the sign above the tables of the Iron Skillet restaurant, where truckers sit mostly alone, carrying the solitude of their jobs into an otherwise social setting. Driving a long-haul tractor-trailer is as commonplace as the items that drivers carry, from blue jeans to blueberries, from toilet paper for Walmart to farm machinery bound for export. There are 1.7 million men and women working as long-haul drivers in the country. Yet truckers -- high up in their cabs -- are literally out of view for most Americans.
At a moment when President Trump has ignited a national discussion of blue-collar labor and even climbed into a truck during a White House event, trucking, which was once among the best-paying such jobs, has become low-wage, grinding, unhealthy work. Turnover at large for-hire fleets hauling freight by the truckload -- the backbone of the industry -- runs an astonishing 80 percent a year, according to a trade group. Looming over the horizon is a future in which self-driving trucks threaten to eliminate many drivers' livelihoods.
Still, trucking continues to draw plenty of newcomers, reflecting the lack of good alternatives for workers without a higher education (one survey found that 17 percent of truckers had less than a high school diploma). Some have lost better-paying manufacturing jobs in the continuing deindustrialization of America. Others have spent years knocking on the door of the middle class in minimum-wage jobs in fast food or retail. To them, trucking is a step up.
Over two days recently, The New York Times spoke to truckers at the Petro stop, which sits at the intersection of Interstate 57, between Chicago and Memphis, and Interstate 70, between Indianapolis and St. Louis. These interviews were edited and condensed. The maps show drivers' routes in picking up and delivering their loads.
(The Times also wants to hear what long-haul truckers wish car drivers knew and see how they have made the inside of their cabs into a home. Share your stories.)
'The Clock's Ticking, the Clock's Ticking'
Greg Simmons, 54, Hastings, Fla. Driving 27 years.
We're throwaway people. Nobody cares about us. Everybody's perception of a truck driver is we clog up traffic, we get in the way, we pollute the environment.
We're just like cops. Everybody needs us, but nobody wants us.
Before trucking, I did electronics, but there was no pay in it. What I did not know is, when you do this for a living, you can't go to night school and train for something else. This sucks up so much of your time.
Truckers are paid mostly by the mile, not the hour. Federal rules say they can drive 11 hours within a 14-hour window, and then they must stop for a 10-hour break. Many resent the 14-hour rule.
Everybody's constantly looking at the clock. If you get caught in a traffic jam for four hours, that's four hours of your productivity gone. Or if you go to pick up a load and these people take five and a half hours to load you, they've killed five and a half hours of your day. The clock's ticking, the clock's ticking. Got to go, man, got to go! The 14-hour rule has created an unnatural amount of pressure. For the young fellows, after two or three months, they say the hell with this.
Why do you keep driving?
Because at 54 years old, nobody wants me. I can't retrain for anything else. For older people, you kind of get trapped. For every one that does well, there's 30 that it destroys.
'I Told Her That I Would Do Whatever It Took'
Ayisha Gomez, 39, Riverside County, Calif. Driving three years.
There were a lot of women in my training class. There were a lot of younger, I would say girls, going through. I think it's women trying to prove themselves. And there are so many of us who are single mothers and the work that's out there, we just can't support our families.
Ms. Gomez said she worked for AutoZone for about eight years before becoming a truck driver. Women make up 5 percent of truckers.
My daughter got accepted to U.C.-Davis, and she wasn't going to go because we couldn't afford it. I told her that I would do whatever it took.
It is very stressful being away from home, being out of contact with people.
I was driving cross-country and stopped in Texas to pick up a cousin of mine. Her sister was having a baby. I said, "I'll take you home to California." We hardly talked at all on the trip. You forget how to communicate with people. You're by yourself constantly. There's nobody to talk to except when you're picking up or dropping off a load.
Are you in a romantic relationship at home?
Yes. He is my high school sweetheart. We got back in touch with each other and things are falling in place. But it's hard on him because he doesn't understand what goes on out here. He's always watching the weather and the news, and calling to tell me there's a storm coming up, please be careful. He's worried about me being at truck stops and rest areas at night. He doesn't want me coming in in the evenings to take showers.
Do you feel in danger as a woman?
In the beginning, I noticed I got a lot of dirty looks from men. You hear remarks under their breath when you're coming through the truck stops. I don't hear it anymore. I've learned to tune everybody out. I don't pay attention to anybody around me. I'm always aware of my surroundings, I notice what people are wearing, what they're looking at, but if you are passing me, it looks like I'm always looking down at the ground.
Ms. Gomez explained that her first year was the hardest because she was required to drive for the large freight company that trained her, which paid a low mileage rate. Since the trucking industry was deregulated a generation ago, drivers' pay has fallen. Truckers earn on average $43,600 a year, less than in 1980 when adjusted for inflation. Many work the equivalent of two full-time jobs. Now Ms. Gomez drives for a small mom-and-pop company, which pays better than the industry average.
Did you think of quitting that first year?
No. I'm not a quitter. It was very hard. My daughter kept me going. She wants to be a social worker. My oldest son has been in trouble since he was about 15. He's currently in prison. He got sentenced to 21 years for attempted murder. Now, he is part of a gang. He's got tattoos all over him. I'm so disappointed.
When all of this happened, my daughter went through a really hard time. I sat down and had a long talk with her. She decided she wanted to work with youth and try to help before they end up like her brother.
Trucking is not a career for me. I'm only doing this as long as I have to in order to get all of my daughter's student loans taken care of. She's on her third year. I'll be doing it for a few more years.
'Something I've Always Wanted to Do'
Michael Gallant, 22, Biddeford, Me. Driving eight months.
Truck driving is something I've always wanted to do since I was a little kid. I love it. There are some times when it's kind of a crappy job, but other times it's great. Over all, I'm very happy with my job. I wouldn't change a thing about it.
I worked at a garden center for four years before this. I was making 12 bucks an hour. Kind of at the bottom of the pile.
I got my C.D.L. [commercial driver's license] relatively quickly, in Springfield, Mo. I took a Greyhound bus all the way from Portland, Me., to Springfield, Mo. That was 45 hours. Wasn't exactly fun.
At the minimum I try to stay out for at least four weeks. I'm the type of guy -- when I start going, I like to work and work and work. I'm single, no kids, no debt to my name.
Do you worry, as a young driver, that self-driving trucks could take over the industry?
That's a touchy subject. I haven't really thought too much on it. I think it'll be a little while until we get to that point. You'll still need a driver to make sure that nothing goes wrong with that truck. I don't see it all becoming autonomous.
'Any One of My Grandkids Do It, I'll Kill 'Em'
Ron Carrabis, 70, Las Vegas. Driving 30 years for the same company.
My kids all grew up with me driving a truck. A lot of missed football games, a lot of missed school plays, birthdays, anniversaries. It's very hard on your home life if you don't have an understanding woman. My wife and I have been married 44 years. But there's other drivers out here that have been married two, three and four times.
Mr. Carrabis retired over the weekend.
We have a motor home sitting in our driveway that every time I come home, it goes, "C'mon."
Would you recommend trucking to a young person?
Any one of my grandkids do it, I'll kill 'em.
'My Last Husband Hated Me Being a Truck Driver'
Patricia Moore, 60, Oak Grove, La. Driving 15 years.
I haven't been married in over 10 years. My last husband hated me being a truck driver. He used to fight with me on the phone out here on the road. I loved it when I had no signal.
It was either my job or his alcohol, and I picked my job.
What's the best part of being a trucker?
A paycheck.
A friend of mine said, "If you're out here on the road, how come you don't make more money than you make?"
Everybody paints this as glamorous. Yeah, we get to see the country. At 65 miles per hour from the Interstate.
How is your health?
Horrible. They can't figure out what's wrong with my stomach. We eat a lot of junk food. Like last night I ate Subway. It's junk. In 15 years, I've gained 70 pounds.
I've also got hurt on my job, tore my knee tugging trailers and all that. Dollying up a trailer, I tore up my rotary cuff.
It's always go go go, no time for yourself. You might get home at 2, 3 o'clock in the morning. If I get home on Friday, most of the time I got to get back out on Sunday. Sometimes I wear my uniform to church because I got to go straight to my truck.
Do you have a retirement plan?
What's retirement? Sounds boring. I'm single, I have no money saved up, I've lived paycheck to paycheck. My fault. I didn't think about retirement growing up. This is the first time I've ever made decent money in my life.
Last month, Ms. Moore quit long-haul trucking and moved to Midland, Tex., to be closer to a son, where she now drives an 18-wheeler that services the oil fields of West Texas. In a phone interview, she said the job allows her to return home every night, and has other benefits.
I bettered myself -- almost doubled my salary. I bought me a brand-new car, a 2017 Chevrolet, two days after I hit this town. My health is also better. I've lost some weight. I cook my own food now.
'It's Pretty Lonely'
Wayne McLaurin, 46, St. Louis. Driving five years.
I was a customer service rep in St. Louis. When the recession hit, there was no jobs to be found. The only thing that was in the newspaper at that time was nursing and truck driving. Within five weeks, you can be on the road and have a career. I've been doing it ever since.
I stay away two to three months at a time. It's pretty lonely. It's tiring. It's depressing, you know what I mean? My whole thing is to try to get away from trucking, whether it be real estate, maybe an owner-operator, something like that. In order to get out of the business, you've got to have something to fall back on.
Are you saving money?
Yes. I want to walk away this year with about $25,000 to $40,000.
In the beginning, it was fun, like the young fellow over there. [He pointed at Mr. Gallant across the restaurant counter.] But the older I got, it was like, you need to do something else. You can't do this forever.
The best thing about it, to me, is you don't have anybody looking over your shoulder telling you what to do. You don't have a boss. You have to be able to be disciplined enough to do your job, and they trust you to do that. I love that about it.
When I was a little younger, it was all about getting an opportunity to be out in different cities, seeing things I'd never seen before. But now, O.K., it's time to settle down.
Do you have time for a personal life?
I don't have a personal life. I don't have a girlfriend. And it sucks, it really does. I think about that. When I was a little younger, I always had a relationship. Now doing this, I'm like, why? I realize I'm never in one place at one time.
'Freedom. Oh My God, I Cannot Tell You.'
Daniel McMillan, 33, and Susan Zimmerman, 48, Danville, Va. Driving two years.
Susan: We met working at McDonald's. Trucking was my dream first. I raised my daughter and she was going to college, I needed to better myself. Working for McDonald's for 10 years, trying to raise your child on a McDonald's wage, you could only rely on tax season to get her stuff. Daniel encouraged me to go get my C.D.L.
Daniel: She came back and picked me up. I jumped on her truck and she trained me. Then I got my C.D.L.
Susan: I'll drive eight hours and he'll drive eight hours, and then we shut down. Now we're owner-operators. We are a company.
People say it's lonely on the road, but it must be different for a couple.
Daniel: We have friends that were truck drivers, their home life fell apart.
Susan: Their spouses cheated.
Daniel: Children going crazy, going to jail.
What's the best part of trucking?
Daniel: Freedom. Oh my God, I cannot tell you.
Susan: Beautiful sunny days.
Daniel: You get your crappy days, don't get me wrong. But we woke up in Laredo one time, it was 79 degrees in the morning. You got to trade the good for the bad.
Most people think trucking is old rednecks going down the road. But it's very diverse. We've seen whole families out here.
Susan: Speaking for myself, there's not many disappointments of the job. Every day, you wake up somewhere different. You have sunrises and sunsets. Yeah, it's the same sun, but it's different everywhere -- the colors, the textures.
We get to see our daughter three times a year. We get loads to Florida, where she's in college. We shut the truck down and get a rental car and go hang out with our daughter.
She gets scholarships because she's a great student. But then you have to send money because they have to live.
Are you engaged?
Susan: Yes
Do you have a date?
Daniel: September of 2018.
Susan: We were going to get married this year, but my daughter needs a car.

Full text: ALBANY -- Nearly four decades ago, New York City's subway system hit rock bottom: track fires, graffiti-covered cars and crime came to symbolize that era. An intervention was required. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, under the leadership of Richard Ravitch, persuaded the governor and legislative leaders to allow the agency to issue bonds -- clearing the way for a $7.2 billion, five-year capital program.
The money went quickly, with much of what was earmarked for the subway system going toward new train cars and refurbishing of the existing fleet.
But two major projects -- the Second Avenue subway line and East Side Access, a plan that would allow Long Island Rail Road passengers to disembark at Grand Central Terminal -- were ignored and were abandoned for decades.
With each five-year capital plan, the authority has had to weigh long-term objectives against short-term needs, with immediacy almost always winning out.
Today, as the daily experience of riders on New York City's subways becomes increasingly dire, attention has turned to these five-year capital budgets, which together have poured more than $100 billion into infrastructure since the early 1980s.
The problem has been one of simple math and competing interests. The money must be spread among all of the M.T.A.'s agencies, including two commuter railroads, nine bridges and tunnels, a bus system and the largest subway network in the country. Most importantly, say transit advocates and experts, the money spent has never been enough, leading to the current crisis.
"In every other Western and Asian country, the national governments subsume the burden of paying the capital needs of their public transportation systems," Mr. Ravitch said in a recent interview. "In the U.S. it's been a struggle. The federal government has provided only a fraction of what the needs are.
"But if your responsibility is the governance of New York and you are not going to get the money from a fairy godmother, then you have no choice but to extract revenue from the people who vote," he continued. "There's no other magic way."
It was only a year ago when Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo proudly announced the approval of what he called the "most robust transportation plan in state history," a $29.5 billion capital program intended to "meet the travel demands of the next generation."
It did not take long for the second-guessing to begin.
"While this is the largest capital program we have had so far, most of what it does is keep the subway system from falling apart," said John Raskin, executive director of the Riders Alliance, an advocacy group.
An explosive growth in ridership since the 1980s has outstripped the capital budget's ability to keep pace with the strains, transit advocates say, threatening to make the subway system a victim of its own success.
Delays have more than doubled in frequency, rising to over 70,000 each month from about 28,000 a month in 2012. Overcrowding accounts for more than a third of the subway delays. Last week, the M.T.A. announced a $20 million plan to address the problem, vowing to tackle issues associated with overcrowding, sick passengers, tracks and signals.
At the same time, subway cars are breaking down faster. The average distance traveled between breakdowns is about 112,000 miles, down from 200,000 in November 2010. The authority, in its defense, points out that the current rate remains a staggering improvement from 1981, when the mean distance between failures was 7,000 miles.
The challenges facing Mr. Cuomo and the authority, which he largely controls, are manifold. Parts of the system are more than a century old; replacing everything would cost upward of a trillion dollars. The agency has had to balance expanding the system to meet new ridership demands -- witness the three new stations on the Second Avenue line -- against the daily upkeep of behind-the-scenes mechanisms like signals and exhaust fans. Fixes are neither fast nor cheap.
Much of the state's portion of the capital plan has historically been financed through bonds, putting a burden on the agency's operating budget, nearly a fifth of which goes to paying down debt service. "The M.T.A. has been forced to cannibalize itself," said James F. Brennan, a former Brooklyn assemblyman who was chairman of the committee overseeing government authorities.
Mr. Cuomo's administration counters that he has made a priority of the authority's capital budget. About half of the budget goes to the subways, while the rest is allotted to buses, commuter rail, tunnels and bridges.
The governor committed $8.3 billion in state money to the current plan, up from $770 million for the last one, for a total capital budget of $29.5 billion -- the largest ever, even when inflation is taken into account, according to budget officials. (Critics have complained that the state has not identified the source or specified the timing of its funds.)
In contrast with past practice, the state pledged to cover the expense of much of the borrowing, acknowledging the fiscal stress it had caused the agency. Also, Mr. Cuomo squeezed an additional $1.8 billion from New York City itself, a significant jump in its contribution.
"People are always going to say, 'We want more,"' Robert Mujica, the state's budget director, said. "But the governor has recognized that the state needs to put up more, and that's why the governor this time has said we are going to fund $8 billion and we're going to pay the debt service."
Still, some experts and advocates said the authority's rate of capital investment did not match the system's value. A 2015 report by the Urban Land Institute and the Permanent Citizens Advisory Committee to the authority, called "Keeping New York on Track," said the agency's rate of investment in its infrastructure, as represented by its capital budget, was 1.1 percent, significantly lower than that of similar private companies, where it might range from 6 percent to 12 percent.
"The level of investment we've been making every five years is inadequate," said Veronica Vanterpool, an authority board member who heads the Tri-State Transportation Campaign, an advocacy group. "The M.T.A. puts out a capital program with a price tag based on what is politically feasible, instead of what the system truly needs."
Another report from the authority that was commissioned by Mr. Cuomo drew similar conclusions: that depreciation of the agency's trillion-dollar asset was "far outpacing investment" in maintaining its infrastructure. The 2014 report, from the M.T.A. Transportation Reinvention Commission, said that the funding challenges put the authority "at best on a path of continual catch-up."
"Our recommendations got buried," said Ms. Vanterpool, a member of the commission that wrote the report.
Yet the authority says the current capital plan will go a long way toward relieving some of the problems that have troubled the system. The plan allocates $3.2 billion for more than 1,000 new cars, many with an accordion-style design that allows riders to move between cars while the train is in motion.
In addition, the capital plan invests $2.75 billion to upgrade signals, including more than $1 billion earmarked for the computerized system known as communication-based train control, which allows cars to run closer together.
Still, some budget experts say that transit officials should have invested in computerized signals years ago.
"The mistake was the incredibly slow place at which they have approached upgrading and modernizing the signal system," said Charles Brecher, director of research at the Citizens Budget Commission, an independent watchdog group. "What was spent on the Second Avenue subway could have paid for a lot of new signals."
Veronique Hakim, interim executive director of the authority, insisted it had entered a new era of growth and renewal. "We spent the first 20 years of capital programs fixing decades of neglect in the transit system," she said. "All of that changed dramatically."
Others, including Mitchell L. Moss, a professor of urban policy and planning at New York University, and Gene Russianoff, the leader of the Straphangers Campaign rider advocacy group, agreed that modernizing the signal system should have been a priority in previous capital programs.
"When you're talking about maintenance and improvements to such a massive and complex system as New York City Transit, trends develop over time and they are invisible to the riding public for years," said Tom Wright, executive director of the Regional Plan Association, a nonprofit group.
"Then there's more demand on the system, capacity is not increasing, maintenance is being stretched out," he said. "And it doesn't become visible until it hits a certain threshold level. That is what transit advocates expected to happen, and it's what is happening now."

Full text: There is still no consensus on why the last housing boom and bust happened. That is troubling, because that violent housing cycle helped to produce the Great Recession and financial crisis of 2007 to 2009. We need to understand it all if we are going to be able to avoid ordeals like that in the future. But the explanations for what happened in housing are not, I think, to be found in the conventional data favored by economists but rather in sociologically important narratives -- like tales of getting rich through "flipping" houses and shares of initial public offerings -- that constitute the shifting mentality of the era.
Consider the data for a moment. It shows us that extreme changes took place but doesn't tell us why.
Real home prices rose 75 percent from February 1997 to December 2005, according to the S&P/Case-Shiller National Home Price Index, corrected for inflation by the Consumer Price Index. And then, from 2005 to 2012, real prices reversed course, falling to just 12 percent above their 1997 level. In the years since 2012, they have climbed 29 percent, about halfway back to their 2005 peak. This is a roller coaster in national home prices -- it has been even scarier in some more volatile cities -- yet we have no clarity on why it happened.
The problem for economists is that these changes don't correspond to movements in the usual suspects: interest rates, building costs, population or rents. The Consumer Price Index for Rent of Primary Residence, compiled by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics and corrected for inflation, went up only 8 percent in 1997 to 2005, so unmet demand for housing services can't explain the huge increase in real home prices. It doesn't explain the 29 percent rise in real home prices since 2012 either, because inflation-adjusted rents increased only 10 percent in that period. So what has been driving the wild ride in home prices?
I believe the price swings have something to do with the changing mentality of the times, changes caused by narratives that have gone viral and swept across the population. Looking for answers in such popular stories contrasts starkly with the prominent approach of modeling people as though they react logically to economic forces. But a less orthodox approach can be quite useful.
One thing is clear: The prevalent narratives of 1997 to 2005 did not include the concept of a housing bubble, not at first. A computer search using ProQuest or Google Ngrams shows that the phrase "housing bubble" was hardly used until 2005, the end of the boom. What is a bubble? It typically includes the notion that, spurred by the public's expectation of ever further price increases, demand eventually reaches levels that cannot be sustained, and so the enthusiasm wanes and the bubble collapses. But that thought was just not on many people's minds then, the evidence suggests.
Instead, during the 1997 to 2005 boom there were multitudes of narratives about smart investors who were bold enough to take a position in the market. To single out one strand, recall the stories of flippers who would buy a house, fix it up, and resell it within months at a huge profit. These stories appear to have been broadly exciting to people who didn't flip houses themselves but who appear to have begun to think that stretching a little and buying a house with a large mortgage would make them wise investors.
In his book "The Complete Guide to Flipping Properties," published in 2004, Steve Berges extolled what he called "the O.P.M. principle," meaning "other people's money." He wrote, "Your objective is to control as much real estate as possible while using as little of your own capital as possible." In other words, borrow as much as you can. He wrote about the upside of leverage but not about the perils of leverage during the kind of big price drops that were just around the corner.
It can take a long time for narratives like this to grip the popular imagination. Flipping was "a thing" in the condominium conversion boom of the 1970s and '80s. The idea then was this: Big-time converters with deep pockets would buy apartment buildings and convert the rental apartments to owner-occupied condos, selling units to diverse individuals, some of them flippers. For public relations purposes, converters would offer to sell at reduced prices to renters already living in a building, and typically to some outsiders, too.
This generated buzz. When renters and speculators flipped their purchase contracts at a big profit, sometimes using borrowed money for down payments to flip multiple units without actually even closing on the condos, it was thrilling. It seemed that anyone with energy and initiative could get rich doing this.
Some people eager to make quick profits bought Donald J. Trump's well-timed 2004 book, "Trump: Think Like a Billionaire: Everything You Need to Know About Success, Real Estate, and Life," written with Meredith McIver. Some enrolled in the less well-timed Trump University, which emphasized real estate investment in 2005, at the very end of the housing boom; it shut down, amid lawsuits and recrimination, in 2010.
Narratives about flipping weren't restricted to real estate. Just after the time of the condo boom, stories of rapid buying and selling of initial public offerings took off as well. As with the condo promoters, I.P.O. underwriters would sell some shares below market prices to customers, who might then flip the I.P.O. for a quick profit.
The promoters of condo conversions and I.P.O.s were onto something. By giving discounts to buyers who would make a high return, they captivated the nation with tales of people who had no advanced degrees or hefty résumés but made fortunes anyway.
By now, the notion of getting rich by flipping houses is entrenched. I searched Amazon for books on "flipping houses" and came up with 328 hits, most written in the past few years. Buying and rehabbing existing houses for resale is a legitimate business. But many of these books make extravagant pitches and seem aimed at inspiring amateurs to plunge into risky ventures.
The public fascination with speculating in housing has been held in check by regulators empowered by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, but that restraint is tenuous with the election as president of a real estate promoter intent on reducing regulators' power. These narratives are still potent and could easily spur further spirals in the housing market.

Student Debt's Grip on the Economy

Full text: After decades of rising college costs and tepid income growth, student debt has become a drag on graduates' hopes and a threat to economic growth. The cost of a four-year college education, adjusted for inflation, is two and half times as much as it was in the 1978-79 school year, while median family income has increased only 20 percent.
A new report by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York documents the hardship that has resulted from the soaring level of student debt taken on to cover those costs. About one in 10 student borrowers is behind on repayments, the highest delinquency level of any type of borrowing in the Fed's survey, including home mortgages, auto loans and credit cards.
Loan payments are keeping young people from getting on with life, delaying marriage and homeownership, other data show. Research also suggests that student debt is crowding out other investment and spending that would otherwise occur. So the fallout from these burdens, afflicting those who are supposedly best prepared to face and shape the future, is not only a personal-financial issue but also a social and economic one.
Total student debt -- $1.3 trillion -- is more than double what it was as recently as 2008 and is more than Americans have racked up for cars or credit cards.
But wages for college-educated workers have only recently shown gains. They rose 6.6 percent from 2014 to 2016, as the labor market improved, but that still leaves them a mere 4.5 percent above where they were in 2002.
Wage gains would have to be considerably more robust to handle rising debt burdens.
The average wage of a worker with a bachelor's degree worked out to nearly $32 an hour, with those ages 21 to 24 making only about $19 an hour last year. Nearly 40 percent of households headed by someone younger than 40 had student debt, $29,800 on average, in 2013. (The median amount was nearly $17,000, but nearly 20 percent of those households owed more than $50,000.)
The total amount of student debt pales in comparison to mortgage debt, so it does not pose the same threat to the economy that the housing bubble caused. But it does weaken economic growth and foster inequality, a further scourge that crimps spending and investing and impedes broader prosperity. Households headed by young college-educated adults without student debt have about seven times the median net worth of those households with student debt, the Pew Research Center found.
Better administration of government repayment plans could help borrowers in the short run. But a more enduring solution is to increase wage growth by enabling white-collar and service-sector employees to bargain collectively, making more salaried workers eligible for overtime pay, ending discriminatory practices that result in pay disparities based on race and gender, and tightening up the visa system that lets companies in technology, finance and other white-collar fields use cheaper foreign labor to fill jobs or replace workers in the United States.
The alternative is a society and an economy where even many college-educated workers cannot get ahead.

Full text: THE VANISHING AMERICAN ADULT Our Coming-of-Age Crisis -- and How to Rebuild a Culture of Self-Reliance By Ben Sasse 306 pp. St. Martin's Press. $27.99. Ben Sasse is a lucky man. That, at least, is the impression one gets from reading his new book, "The Vanishing American Adult," even if the junior Republican senator from Nebraska -- a 45-year-old conservative whose political ascent has been remarkably swift -- is at pains to deny that luck has had anything to do with it. He might hail from an ancestral line that includes a Lutheran church officer on one side and a manufacturing executive on the other, but he spent his childhood learning the value of "real work," weeding soybean fields as a 7-year-old and waking before dawn to detassel corn. Any privilege in his upbringing was a temptation to be resisted rather than a boon to be enjoyed. The same now goes for his three children. Last year the Sasses sent their 14-year-old daughter to work on a cattle ranch so that she could experience the "unrelenting encounter with daily necessity," like learning how to drive a manual tractor and, he proudly recounts, donning shoulder-length gloves to perform rectal exams on pregnant cows.
"At our house we have come to conclude that building and strengthening character will require extreme measures and the intentional pursuit of gritty work experiences," Sasse writes, and he presents his book as a guide for parents determined not to raise the kind of soft, entitled kids he encountered when he was president of Midland University. He says that the idea for "The Vanishing American Adult" first came to him several years ago, when a group of Midland students were asked to decorate a 20-foot Christmas tree on campus, and they dressed only "the bottom seven or eight feet ... the branches the kids could easily reach." Sasse was "startled" -- "shattered," even. Seeing this Christmas tree "worried me for the kids." So began his growing awareness of "a collective coming-of-age crisis without parallel in our history." He noticed that the affliction he observed at Midland could be found in the households of his closest friends and even his own home. His daughters once complained of being unable to sleep because the air-conditioning was broken. Sasse was aghast. "When I was a kid, we had airconditioning in the house ... but we never used it." The fact that his daughters claimed a "need" for air-conditioning left him and his wife with "a heavy sense of failure."
The nagging anxieties, the feelings of defeat, the inflation of picayune examples to Defcon 1 threats -- all signs point to yet another book intended for panicky upper-middle-class parents. What distinguishes "The Vanishing American Adult," however, is Sasse's suggestion that it isn't merely the well-being of a younger generation that's at stake, but the very future of the Republic. He warns that his anecdotes add up to something far larger, and far more troubling, than poorly dressed Christmas trees and broken A.C.s would initially suggest: American youth have been so coddled that "we lack an educated, resilient citizenry capable of navigating the increasing complexities of daily life." "Economic disruption" has made "a culture of self-reliance ... more urgent than ever before." Parents need to steer their children away from the dangers of "idleness and passive drift" -- of, as he puts it, "affluenza."
The result is a strange hybrid of a book, part how-to manual, part jeremiad, filled with rambling disquisitions on the likes of Augustine, Teddy Roosevelt and the philosopher John Dewey, who serves as the villain of Sasse's chapters on education, wherein families seeking to nurture their children's individual "souls" do battle with a "homogenized" public school system in thrall to Dewey's "totalizing goals." (It should be said that this is a rather creative interpretation of Dewey's work. It should also be said that Sasse's children are home schooled, and that he unequivocally praised Betsy DeVos -- who sponsored unregulated charter school expansion in Michigan, with poor results -- as an "excellent pick" for secretary of education.) Studded throughout are listicles of tips that can get highly specific, like forgoing flotation devices in the water for children ("Let go and re-grab them ... and then celebrate their survival"); sending "your 2-year-old to get your socks every morning"; and enlisting your offspring to "build a pet cemetery." He waxes nostalgic about "aging members of the Greatest Generation," especially his grandmother Elda, a tiny dynamo of a woman who jury-rigged her newborn baby's bassinet to a "lumbering old John Deere as she taught herself to harvest."
All of this makes "The Vanishing American Adult" both voluble and evasive at once, as Sasse layers tale upon tale, repeats modifiers and metaphors (at least three separate mentions of "bubble wrap," all of them pejorative), and serves up bland platitudes ("our common humanity") without venturing much by way of political specifics. In other words, this is a consummate politician's book, and Sasse declares he's writing not "as a senator, but rather as a citizen, as a dad, as a reader, and as a former college president." What he's advising is simply so much "common sense."
As one of the first so-called Never Trump Republicans before the presidential election, he has curiously little to say about the new president, other than to refer in passing to having "said a number of things critical of the honesty and trustworthiness of both major party presidential front-runners" before returning to his daughter's month on the cattle ranch. Indeed, during the election campaign Sasse roundly characterized Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton as "both liars" who were one and the same, which just goes to show: Having a grandmother who attached a bassinet to her tractor doesn't necessarily endow you with an ability to make distinctions or a sense of proportion.
Nor does it save you from a sentimentality that seems almost willfully impervious to the facts at hand. As much as Sasse wants to indict millennials for our "crisis" of "character," young Americans voted decisively against the presidential candidate who lacked any governing experience, bragged about groping women's genitals and actively courted the bigoted vote; it was voters over the age of 65 who favored Trump by an 8 percent margin. To read "The Vanishing American Adult" is to reside in a parallel universe where older Americans stoically uphold standards of decency and responsibility, instead of electing to the country's highest office a reality-TV star with six business bankruptcies to his name who brazenly flouts both.
But it's more demanding to reckon with stubborn facts than it is to resort to clichés about the Problem With Kids Today and how "suffering can be virtuous." (That this book purports to be so above partisan politics that it's blurbed by both Marco Rubio and Cory Booker is as telling as it is unsurprising.) Considering all of Sasse's talk about hard work, maybe the most peculiar aspect of "The Vanishing American Adult" is how it takes the easy way out: Sasse, a Republican senator and history Ph.D. who holds actual power during a particularly fraught moment, decided that now was the time for him to publish what ultimately amounts to a self-help book for well-to-do parents.
Still, there is something politically coherent in this. The Republican Party has been pushing a hyperindividualistic ideology for decades, fixated on the idea that the solution to every problem lies with each American falling back on his or her own personal reserves of "self-discipline and self-control." In this unforgiving cosmology, there isn't much room for forces that aren't so amenable to an individual's will -- and sure enough, there isn't much room for them in Sasse's book either. Economic scarcity? We're an "exceptionally prosperous nation" whose biggest problems are the "surplus creature comforts" that "make a civilization fat and unambitious." (He approvingly quotes a friend whose travels to Ecuador made him "realize that America's poor are rich by comparison.") Racism? The United States is now "free of the racist legal barriers that held back many Americans" and is "finally transcending our slaveholding past." Sexism? What's that?
It must be nice to be Ben Sasse, in a position to pick and choose the hardships one will adopt in order to learn some life lessons -- and to feel morally superior for having triumphed over phony adversity. But to anyone who buys into the notion, especially now, that the country's political future can be rescued by getting our toddlers to bring us our socks, one can only say: Good luck with that.

Scandal in Brazil Raises Fear of Turmoil's Return

Full text: RIO DE JANEIRO -- Just a few days ago, Brazil seemed to be turning a corner. The stock market was soaring. Bankers were cheering. The nation's cutthroat lawmakers were lining up to curb spending. Inflation had been tamed. Brazil, it appeared, was finally on the mend.
Then, in a matter of hours, it all started falling apart. President Michel Temer, long embroiled in graft scandals, suddenly became tangled in a new one, accused of taking millions of dollars in illicit payments and caught on tape discussing how to obstruct an anticorruption drive.
The allegations -- including testimony released Friday in which executives at one of the world's largest food companies accused him of taking about $4.6 million in illegal campaign contributions -- have ignited broad calls for Mr. Temer's resignation, sent markets whipsawing and set off fears that Brazil will slide back into the political and economic turmoil that has rattled it for the last two years.
The testimony, released by the Supreme Court, also described tens of millions of dollars in illicit payments into offshore accounts intended to benefit his impeached predecessor, Dilma Rousseff, and her mentor, former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, both of whom have denied any wrongdoing in the matter.
The bombshell made it clear that the political and economic upheaval in Latin America's largest country is far from over. Mr. Temer, who took over after Ms. Rousseff's ouster only a year ago, is facing the biggest crisis of his already rocky presidency. Mr. da Silva, who has been angling for a comeback, was facing multiple corruption investigations even before the allegations were revealed on Friday.
On top of that, the politicians in line to take over if Mr. Temer falls -- including the speaker of the house and the leader of the Senate -- are also embroiled in corruption investigations, raising deep concerns over the nation's leadership and future.
"The damage done to our institutions and to rule of law needs to be stanched," Paulo Sérgio Pinheiro, a former secretary of human rights, wrote in the newspaper Folha de S.Paulo, describing the latest crisis as a "unique and tragic moment in our history."
"We've arrived at the end of the line," he said.
Beyond the torrent and staggering scale of the accusations, many Brazilians have been shocked that the latest scandal became public because Mr. Temer, a veteran of Brazil's Machiavellian politics, stepped into a trap that has ensnared him before: He was caught on tape by someone he trusted.
"It's stunning that this isn't even the first time Temer has been recorded and betrayed in recent months," said Mauricio Santoro, a political scientist at the State University of Rio de Janeiro. "You'd think a Brazilian president would be less careless."
Mr. Temer called it "appalling" the last time a secret recording of him came out, late last year. One of his own ministers had captured their conversation, accusing the president of pressuring him to help an ally in a property deal.
Even then, the double crossing should not have come as a surprise. At each turn in Brazil's long-simmering political crisis, secret recordings have produced one revelation after another, tripping up some powerful politicians.
Now, Mr. Temer is on tape again, this time caught by one of Brazil's richest men.
The latest scandal involves Joesley Batista, 44, an heir to JBS, a food empire with operations across Brazil and the United States. The secret recording is not only raising anxiety over what Mr. Temer did, but also his susceptibility to subterfuge in a political system where leaders often rush to inform on one another.
Mr. Temer, 76, "wound up getting ambushed by a billionaire one March night in Brasília," the capital, said José Casado, a columnist for the newspaper O Globo.
In a move worthy of a plot twist in a thriller, Mr. Batista handed over the recording to investigators as part of a plea deal. The tape caused jaws to drop over Mr. Batista's description of moves that seem to crudely refer to buying off a prosecutor and judges, as well as bribing Eduardo Cunha, the jailed politician who helped to orchestrate the impeachment of Ms. Rousseff.
"I'm good with Eduardo, O.K.?" Mr. Batista is heard telling Mr. Temer on the recording, emphasizing that he had "paid up" his obligations to Mr. Cunha.
"You need to keep that up, got it?" Mr. Temer replied.
At other points in their conversation, which occurred at Mr. Temer's official residence, Mr. Batista described "taking care" of two unnamed judges and counting on a prosecutor who had informed him about a fraud investigation at Brazil's largest pension funds.
Mr. Temer insists that he did nothing wrong and is rejecting calls to resign. But the recording offers a glimpse into how one of Brazil's richest men bragged about obstructing justice to the nation's president.
Critics of Mr. Temer argue that he should never have met in the first place with Mr. Batista, who is the target of a graft investigation. Mr. Temer's growing chorus of opponents is also asking why the president took no legal action upon being told by Mr. Batista about an array of illicit activities.
Mr. Temer was already struggling with dismal approval ratings as he sought approval for cutting pension benefits and curbing the influence of unions. Now a new phase in Brazil's instability seems to have started -- just when it appeared Brazil was turning the page on political upheaval.
"The government's popularity was already low, but now it's even lower," said Carlos Melo, a political scientist at Insper, a business school in São Paulo. "It will be difficult for the government to approve unpopular reforms."
Mr. Temer has governed under a cloud of scandal since taking office a year ago. Ministers in his cabinet have resigned amid claims of trying to stymie corruption inquiries. Mr. Temer also faces accusations that he negotiated a $40 million bribe for his party in 2010, a claim he denies.
Marcos Troyjo, who teaches international relations at Columbia University, said the latest scandal could severely damage the view that Mr. Temer was "getting the economic agenda going."
After being gripped by panic selling on Thursday, Brazilian markets stabilized somewhat on Friday as investors tried to gauge how Mr. Temer's refusal to step down would affect Brazil's economy. Unions were already marshaling resistance to the austerity measures he has proposed.
"I don't even have a job yet and they want us to work until we die," said Julia Canedo, 21, a university student who expressed disgust with Mr. Temer's proposed overhaul of the pension system, which allows many Brazilians to retire in their 50s. "Everyone is lost and can barely follow what's going on because it's so crazy and unstable. I want him to leave."
In addition to the secret recording, executives at JBS, Mr. Batista's company, said that they paid about $4.6 million in illegal campaign contributions to Mr. Temer in 2014, some of which he pocketed himself, according to the court testimony released Friday.
It also described deposits of tens of millions of dollars into offshore accounts to benefit Ms. Rousseff and Mr. da Silva, both of the leftist Workers' Party.
The JBS executives recounted a remarkably ambitious effort to get public loans for the company's global expansion into markets like the United States. They described efforts to influence officials across Brazil's public bureaucracy, regardless of their party affiliation.
The calls for Mr. Temer to resign have come from many sides, including an editorial Friday in O Globo, part of Brazil's most powerful media group.
"If he doesn't go," the newspaper warned, "he'll drag Brazil through an even more profound political crisis."
Stepping down, however, could also expose Mr. Temer to an array of legal battles: He would lose the privileged legal standing that senior officials enjoy in Brazil, often allowing them to avoid prison.
If Mr. Temer resigns, "he can be tried and convicted," said Daniel Vargas, a law professor at Fundação Getúlio Vargas, a university in Rio.

Full text: We're following major developments in the markets throughout the day. Check below for the latest updates. Brazilian Markets Tumble on Political Turmoil
"Brazil's currency, the real, fell sharply against the dollar and stocks plunged in a sell-off" on Thursday, writes Simon Romero in Rio de Janeiro.
The cause: "President Michel Temer of Brazil defied calls to resign on Thursday as an exploding scandal over claims that he authorized the payment of hush money to a jailed ally engulfed Latin America's largest country."
CNBC reports that "the Brazilian Bovespa traded more than 8.5 percent lower, while the widely followed iShares MSCI Brazil Capped ETF dropped more than 13 percent. Both indexes were on pace for their worst day since October 2008."
In the United States, all three major indexes were up slightly in afternoon trading, after the sell-off on Wednesday.
Asian and European Stocks Decline
Concerns that President Trump's economic agenda is losing steam sent European and Asian stock markets lower on Thursday, on the heels of sharp declines in the United States the previous day.
Investors -- who have shrugged off other reports of controversy involving the president -- appear finally to be reacting to apparent turmoil in the Trump administration.
They may be concerned that Mr. Trump's promises to cut corporate taxes and roll back regulations could be affected.
What to Watch For: Fed Speech, Mexico's Central Bank and Japan's Growth
The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, Loretta J. Mester, will deliver a speech in Minneapolis.
Mexico's central bank is expected to raise its benchmark interest rate for a sixth consecutive meeting to combat inflation that is almost double its 3 percent target.
New figures showed Japan's economy grew for a fifth consecutive quarter, the longest period of expansion in a decade. But weak inflation suggests it won't last.
Don't forget to read the DealBook Morning Agenda.
Deutsche Bank Wants Ex-Bosses to Pay for Misconduct
Deutsche Bank is in "advanced stage" discussions with former members of its management team to make financial contributions for previous misconduct that damaged the lender's reputation, its chairman said at the bank's annual meeting on Thursday.
Paul Achleitner, the Deutsche Bank chairman, said that its supervisory board had been holding "very detailed and extensive discussions about whether and to what extent personal or collective responsibility for past misconduct" should be borne by members of its management board at the time.
"The supervisory board expects that in the coming months there will be an arrangement, which will ensure that all those involved make a substantial financial contribution," Mr. Achleitner said.
He did not name the former management members or indicate how much they might contribute.
The bank said in January that it would "substantially limit" bonuses for its top bankers for the 2016 financial year after it agreed in December to pay $7.2 billion to resolve an investigation by American authorities into its sale of toxic mortgage securities.
Shares of Deutsche Bank were down less than 1 percent in afternoon trading in Germany on Thursday. -- CHAD BRAY

Conservatives' New Platform Hopes to Lure Working-Class Britons

Full text: LONDON -- It is a British campaign ritual that every party issues its political platform, or manifesto, telling voters what policies it intends to enact if elected. This time, however, with the Conservatives expected to have an easy victory, their manifesto matters more than most. Prime Minister Theresa May introduced the Conservative manifesto in Halifax, West Yorkshire, on Thursday, making some important changes to previous policy to try to reach beyond the party's base to working-class Britons who traditionally have voted for the opposition Labour Party and who voted last year for Britain to leave the European Union.
With even one of Labour's prime supporters, Len McCluskey of the powerful Unite union, admitting that the party will be fortunate not to lose more than 20 seats from its poor performance in 2015, Mrs. May is moving away from the Conservatives' neoliberal, Thatcherite past and reshaping the party as a more nationalist, meritocratic one that cares about social benefits and equal opportunity.
A month after Mrs. May shocked the country by calling an early election and only three weeks before polling day, June 8, she insisted again on Thursday that "every vote for me is a vote to strengthen my hand in the Brexit negotiations," referring to Britain's exit from the European Union. She sought as well to draw a contrast between her personality and that of the left-wing Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn.
While continually uttering the mantra of a "strong and stable government," she has been contrasting that with the prospect of "a coalition of chaos" should Mr. Corbyn form a minority government with the Scottish National Party and the Liberal Democrats.
She hailed "a manifesto to see us through Brexit and beyond" and a "plan for a stronger, fairer and more prosperous Britain," one "rooted in the hopes and aspirations of working people." Her speech essentially tried to justify her decision to call a new election three years early to get her own mandate and ensure a larger majority in Parliament through March 2019, when two years of negotiations with the European Union are supposed to end.
But as she made clear on Thursday, some of her policies draw a clear contrast to her predecessor, David Cameron, who quit when he lost the referendum on leaving the bloc and was also associated more with the neoliberal, free-market economics that British and European populists have attacked.
And while Mrs. May was a quiet supporter of the "Remain" campaign to stay in the European Union, she has worked to convince voters that she will keep the promises she has made since becoming prime minister and negotiate a British exit from the European Union that will reduce immigration and mitigate the economic costs of leaving.
Against the quiet advice of many senior Conservatives, Mrs. May has recommitted to a target of keeping net immigration below 100,000 a year, which is considered unrealistic, especially if foreign students coming to Britain for their education are included.
On Thursday, the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, said the cabinet was "completely united" behind the target. But the Cameron-era chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, authorized an editorial in The Evening Standard, which he now edits, to assert that "none of its senior members supports the pledge."
The last year that net immigration was below 100,000 was 1997; in 2016, the figure was 273,000.
Still, if anger over uncontrolled immigration from the European Union was the main driver of the exit vote, as social scientists believe, Mrs. May's pledge, even if never achieved, will reinforce her attraction to Labour and U.K. Independence Party supporters who voted to leave.
One of the reasons for the Conservatives' large lead in the opinion polls is that UKIP is falling apart and moving toward the Conservatives. It is being joined by working-class Labour voters, especially in the north of Britain, who favored a British exit and do not consider Mr. Corbyn a plausible prime minister, even if they like some of his traditional left-wing redistributive policies.
The small centrist Liberal Democrats have called for a second referendum on Britain's exit after the government negotiates a deal with the European Union. But opinion polls indicate that the party is not gaining much traction with a voting public that has come to accept leaving the bloc as inevitable and seems to feel that Mrs. May will negotiate a better deal than Mr. Corbyn would.
To pay for new funding for social benefits and the huge National Health Service, Mrs. May has abandoned two important Cameron pledges intended to appeal to older people. There is no longer a promise that a new Conservative government will not raise income tax or national insurance contributions (though value-added tax will not go up). And there is no longer a promise of a "triple lock" on pensions that increased payments by at least 2.5 percent a year, which in recent years was much higher than the inflation rate.
The Conservatives will also cut back on the promise of free school lunches for all children, regardless of family income, to provide another 1 billion pounds, about $1.3 billion, for school funding, and will only provide subsidies for heating during the winter to those who cannot afford it, rather than to everyone. But it also promises to cap energy bills for many.
While Mr. Cameron seemed to appeal to "the aspiring classes," Mrs. May has pitched her appeal to citizens who are worried about an uncertain future, who are known widely as "Jams" -- those who can "just about manage" to get by.
Under one such proposal, the state would shoulder the cost of long-term care when the family's assets were reduced to £100,000 rather than nothing, as it is now -- assuring elderly relatives could stay in their homes and the next generation would receive some inheritance.
But the proposal would also mean that those who can afford it will pay a larger share of the cost of their care, rather than the state, and some homes might be sold after death, rather than being passed on.
The Tories also promised to increase spending on the National Health Service by at least £8 billion in real terms over the next five years and to reinstitute controversial grammar schools, which select students by exams but which many think are damaging the quality of ordinary public schools. They also promised to increase the national minimum wage to 60 percent of median earnings by 2020 and to lower corporate taxes to 17 percent from 19 percent by 2020, a sharp contrast to Labour's intention to raise them to 26 percent.
Previous Conservative governments have promised various deadlines, none of them met, for a balanced budget; this manifesto promises one only by 2025, even as Britain's cumulative national debt continues to rise.
The Conservatives also pledged to increase defense spending, and keep it above the NATO target of 2 percent of gross domestic product, and to keep foreign aid spending at 0.7 percent of G.D.P. Not surprisingly, they also reject the idea of a new referendum on Scottish independence until Britain's exit "has played out" and "there is public consent for it to happen."
Even before the Conservative manifesto was announced, the Labour Party issued a list of Tory "broken promises" from previous platforms. "From the economy to the N.H.S., and policing to schools, Theresa May's Tories have failed again and again to deliver on the pledges they made," said Andrew Gwynne, Labour's national election coordinator.
On Thursday, Mr. Gwynne said that Mrs. May "offers the majority of working people and pensioners insecurity with a huge question mark over their living standards." The Conservatives, he said, "stand up only for the few."
"For the many," he added, "they offer the prospect of five years of insecurity."
Even if Mrs. May achieves the significantly larger majority she seeks, her problems will not be over, warned Tony Travers, a professor of government at the London School of Economics. "If she wins a majority of over 100, it sounds like the empress of all you survey," he said. "But her party has its own fractures, and the coalition she will create among them is inherently unstable."

Full text: So much for concerns that traders weren't fearful enough. On Wednesday, markets in the United States appeared to have been rattled by a report in The New York Times that President Trump had asked the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, to shut down an investigation into his former national security adviser.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index sank 1.8 percent, the most since September, and the VIX, Wall Street's "fear gauge," a measure of volatility, jumped 46 percent as investors became pessimistic about Mr. Trump's agenda.
Asian stock markets followed suit on Thursday, but the dollar edged up in volatile trading.
It's far from certain that this means the "Trump trade" has come to an end, but the market reaction contrasts with the collective shrugs that followed the firing of Mr. Comey last week, and even the news that Mr. Trump had shared confidential intelligence information with Russian diplomats.
"For the first time, there is real concern that Trump has overstepped his boundaries, which may create some chaos in the market," said Curtis Schenker, co-founder of Scoggin Capital Management.
Amid a stream of news that has put the White House in a state of constant upheaval, Republicans in Congress seem to be less optimistic that they will be able to pass any changes to the tax code.
Speculators are increasing their bets on Mr. Trump's impeachment, The Financial Times noted.
But The New York Times has eight reasons that Republican leaders haven't deserted Mr. Trump and explains how his most loyal supporters are building alternative narratives.
Puerto Rico Faces Its Creditors
As Puerto Rico met with its creditors in court for the first time, tensions between the two sides indicated that a battle lay ahead.
"A conflict is starkly in front of us today," said Marcia Goldstein, a lawyer for the National Public Finance Guarantee Corporation, which has insured about $3.6 billion of the island's bonds.
Tempers flared when the discussion turned to topics like truthful financial disclosures, potential conflicts of interest and the role of Puerto Rico's federal oversight board.
The Federal District Court judge in the case, Laura Taylor Swain, who normally sits in the Southern District of New York, emphasized the need for the parties to continue trying to mediate their differences.
"Failure, frankly, is not an option," Judge Swain said. "We cannot simply turn off the lights and close the door on Puerto Rico."
Quotation of the Day
"This is not a marker we should be superexcited to get back to."
-- Heather Boushey, the executive director and chief economist at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, a liberal think tank, referring to the new peak of $12.7 trillion in American household debt in the first three months of the year. The rising debt level shows that more Americans have sufficiently repaired their credit to qualify for loans, but it also signals the potential for new risks to the economy.
Coming Up
Mexico's central bank will hold its monetary policy meeting. With inflation at an eight-year high, the bank is expected to raise interest rates.

For Better or Worse, Debt Reaches New Peak

Full text: It took nearly a decade, but debt has made a comeback. Americans have now borrowed more money than they had at the height of the credit bubble in 2008, just as the global financial system began to collapse.
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York said Wednesday that total household debt in the United States had reached a new peak -- $12.7 trillion -- in the first three months of the year, another milestone in the long, slow recovery of the nation's economy.
The growing debt level shows that many of the millions of Americans who struggled during the recession have sufficiently repaired their credit to qualify for loans. It also suggests a rising optimism about economic growth among banks and other lenders.
Debt can fuel consumer spending, which accounts for nearly 70 percent of all economic activity in the United States. It also allows Americans to make large investments in education and housing, which can help build personal wealth and financial stability.
Yet the borrowing peak also signals the potential for new risks to the economy.
One of the major factors behind the latest debt binge has been student loans, a mounting burden that can stifle economic growth by preventing Americans from buying homes or spending on big-ticket consumer items.
The fear is that ballooning debt from student loans -- and from auto loans and credit cards -- could put many Americans back into a hole, prompting a new wave of defaults, much like the one that accompanied the mortgage meltdown a decade ago.
"This is not a marker we should be superexcited to get back to," said Heather Boushey, the executive director and chief economist at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, a liberal think tank. "In the abstract, more debt signals optimism. But in reality, families are using debt as a mechanism to pay for things their incomes don't support."
Since World War II, total household debt had been increasing, with only a few interruptions. The financial crisis changed that steady upward march.
In late 2008, household debt began a decline that would last for 19 consecutive quarters, an unprecedented period of deleveraging during which many Americans shied away from new borrowing. Total debt began to rise again in 2013, finally hitting a new high in this year's first quarter.
There is reason to believe that borrowers should be able to better manage their debt now than they did during the financial crisis. The nation's debt load is reaching new heights at a moment when the economy is expanding, a dynamic that makes the latest peak in borrowing less worrisome to economists.
And households today are borrowing differently than they did nine years ago. Student loan debt, driven by soaring tuition costs, now makes up 11 percent of total household debt, up from 5 percent in the third quarter of 2008.
By comparison, mortgage debt is 68 percent of total debt, down from 73 percent during the same period. The household debt figures are not adjusted for inflation.
Student borrowers today owe $1.3 trillion, more than double the $611 billion owed nearly nine years ago. About one in 10 student borrowers is behind on repaying the loans, the highest delinquency rate of any type of loan tracked by the New York Fed's quarterly household debt report.
The student loan market is nowhere near the size of the $8.6 trillion mortgage market, making student borrowing less of a threat to the global financial system than the bad housing loans that touched off the financial crisis in 2008.
But there are similarities in how student loan debt -- like mortgage debt a decade ago -- has managed to pile up.
One idea underpinning the mortgage boom was that homeownership was a clear-cut route to building wealth. That notion was shaken by the housing collapse, which left millions of Americans in foreclosure and their finances in ruins.
Students have gone deep into debt in the belief that a college degree will eventually lead to a higher income. But many students have graduated into a job market where wages have been rising slowly, leaving them with more debt than they can pay off.
Economists are now unsure about how this mountain of student debt will affect the broader economy. Unlike mortgages, student loans cannot typically be shed or restructured, which means that more Americans are shouldering a type of debt that could weigh them down for the rest of their lives, preventing them from buying homes or starting businesses.
"Student debt is a different animal with different rules," said Diane Swonk, founder of DS Economics in Chicago. "It has some good effects, but not always."
Alyssa Pascarosa, 26, owes $100,000 related to the bachelor's degree in sociology she received from the University of Pittsburgh in 2013. The debt shapes nearly all of her financial choices. Ms. Pascarosa initially planned to attend law school but changed her mind after realizing that pursuing that career path would double or triple her debt load.
Instead, Ms. Pascarosa moved back in with her mother in Easton, Pa., where she works as a graphic designer.
"I would like to move out at some point soon," she said, "but with my loans, I can't justify spending money on rent."
Economists have found signs that high student debt levels have contributed to a slowdown in young adults' household formation and a decline in early homeownership.
There are many benefits, of course, to the boom in student lending. More Americans now have college degrees, which will probably increase job opportunities and wages over time.
Workers with a four-year college degree earn significantly more than those without one, in aggregate. And borrowing money to obtain a college degree often proves to be a better investment than taking out a mortgage to buy a home. But how that plays out can vary widely in individual geographic areas and career fields.
Student loans are not the only area in which debt has grown rapidly.
The New York Fed report also shows how growth in auto lending over the past decade has made up for slower mortgage lending. Auto loans totaled about $1.1 trillion, or 9 percent of all household debt, in the first quarter of 2017, up from 6 percent in the third quarter of 2008.
Defaults have crept up in auto loans, one of the few sectors in which lenders were willing to extend credit to subprime borrowers after the 2008 crisis.
Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, said defaults on student and auto loans were a "financial blemish" on otherwise healthy household balance sheets.
"It is not an existential threat to households and the economy," Mr. Zandi said. "It is an area where there is some stress."
More broadly, the economic picture looks far less precarious than it did in late 2008. The amount of monthly income that Americans must spend paying off their debt is smaller, and employment is flush.
That made last month feel like an opportune time for Caitlin Farrell, 34, and her husband to buy their first home, a 1,500-square-foot, two-bedroom house in Sacramento. Ms. Farrell, who works as an education policy researcher, got her home loan from SoFi, a start-up online lender that moved into the mortgage market last year.
"We had been renting and moving all through our 20s," Ms. Farrell said, "and now seemed like the right time to get in."

Full text: TOKYO -- Japan's economic engine may not exactly be roaring, but there is a definite hum in the air. The economy grew for a fifth consecutive quarter at the start of 2017, the longest stretch of growth in more than a decade. The government of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has been trying for four and a half years to coax the economy into a higher gear. Although Japan's output is still the world's third-largest, after the United States and China, consistent growth has been elusive -- the result of headwinds like a declining population and deflation.
What Happened?
Japanese gross domestic product increased by 2.2 percent in annualized terms in the three months through March, the government's Cabinet Office said in a preliminary estimate on Thursday. The economy has now been expanding for a longer period than at any time since 2005-6, when it grew for six quarters in a row.
The pace of expansion also accelerated from the previous quarter, and was stronger than economists had expected. Analysts surveyed by news agencies had forecast a growth rate of 1.7 percent, on average.
What Is Driving Growth?
Exports have been lifting output since the start of the expansion, and they did so again last quarter. A broadly recovering global economy is helping, as is a weaker yen, which makes Japanese cars, electronic components and other goods more affordable abroad. (Japan's trade surplus irritates the Trump administration, which has criticized some of the country's practices.)
The domestic side of the economy has been shakier, with spending by consumers and businesses mostly weak and inconsistent. But in the latest quarter, consumption and business investment both rose.
Is the Economy on a Hot Streak?
A warm one, certainly. Output grew 1 percent in all of 2016 -- not exactly China-fast, but about twice what economists estimate Japan should be able to achieve given its shrinking pool of workers and consumers. For the first few years after Mr. Abe came to office, in 2012, on a promise to kick-start growth, the economy lurched between expansion and contraction. Now it appears to have found a more stable groove.
Is 'Abenomics' Succeeding?
The government and the central bank have been pouring money into the economy, and there's little doubt that those moves have helped lift growth.
But a crucial ingredient is missing: inflation.
The big idea behind "Abenomics," as Mr. Abe's strategy is known, was to engineer a rise in consumer prices, which would in turn lift corporate profits and workers' pay. That, the government said, would make the economy grow not only faster but also more consistently. Prices have barely budged, however, leaving many economists speculating that the current streak, though welcome, will fade.

How Venezuela Has Stumbled to the Brink of Collapse

Full text: Venezuela, by the numbers, resembles a country hit by civil war. Its economy, once Latin America's richest, is estimated to have shrunk by 10 percent in 2016, more than Syria's. Its inflation that year has been estimated as high as 720 percent, nearly double that of second-ranked South Sudan, rendering its currency nearly worthless.
In a country with the world's largest proven oil reserves, food has grown so scarce that three in four citizens reported involuntary weight loss, averaging 19 pounds in a year.
City streets are marked by black markets and violence. The last reported murder rate, in 2014, was equivalent to the civilian casualty rate in 2004 Iraq.
Its democracy, long a point of pride, became the oldest to collapse into authoritarianism since World War II. Power grabs, most recently to replace the Constitution, have led to protests and crackdowns that have killed dozens just this month.
Established democracies are not supposed to implode like this. Steven Levitsky, a Harvard University political scientist, said Venezuela was one of "four or five, ever." Among those, none was as wealthy or fell so far. "In most cases," he said, "the regime quits before it gets this bad."
Venezuela's crisis came through a series of steps whose progression is clear in retrospect, and some of which initially proved popular.
A Two-Party Establishment, Ready to Break
At democracy's founding, in 1958, the country's three leading parties, later narrowed to two, agreed to share power among themselves and oil revenue among their constituents.
Their pact, meant to preserve democracy, came to dominate it. Party elites picked candidates and blocked outsiders, making politics less responsive. The agreement to share wealth fostered corruption.
Economic shocks in the 1980s led many Venezuelans to conclude the system was rigged against them.
In 1992, leftist military officers, led by Lt. Col. Hugo Chávez, attempted a coup. They failed and were imprisoned, but their anti-establishment message resonated, catapulting Mr. Chávez to stardom.
The government instituted a series of reforms that were intended to save the two-party system, but that may have doomed it. A loosening of election rules allowed outside parties to break in. The president freed Mr. Chávez, hoping to demonstrate tolerance.
But the economy worsened. Mr. Chávez ran for president in 1998. His populist message of returning power to the people won him victory.
Populism's Unwinnable War With the State
Despite Mr. Chávez's victory, the two parties still dominated government institutions, which he saw as antagonists or even potential threats.
He passed a new Constitution and purged government jobs. Some moves were broadly popular, like judicial reforms that reduced corruption. Others, like abolishing the legislature's upper house, seemed to have a broader aim.
"He was reducing potential checks on his authority," said John Carey, a Dartmouth College political scientist. Beneath the revolutionary language, Mr. Carey said, was "pretty savvy institutional engineering."
Distrust of institutions often leads populists, who see themselves as the people's true champion, to consolidate power. But institutions sometimes resist, leading to tit-for-tat conflicts that can weaken both sides.
"Even before the economic crisis, you have two things that political scientists all agree are the least sustainable bases for power, personalism and petroleum," Mr. Levitsky said, referring to the style of government that consolidates power under a single leader.
When members of the business and political establishment objected to a series of executive decrees in 2001, Mr. Chávez declared them enemies of the people's revolution.
Because populism describes a world divided between the righteous people and the corrupt elite, each round of confrontation, by drawing hard lines between legitimate and illegitimate points of view, can polarize society.
Supporters and opponents of a leader like Mr. Chávez come to see each other as locked in a high-stakes struggle, justifying extreme action.
A Coup Escalates Conflict Beyond Ideology
In 2002, amid an economic downturn, outrage against Mr. Chávez's policies swelled into protests that threatened to overwhelm the presidential palace.
When he ordered the military to restore order, it instead arrested him and installed an interim leader.
Mr. Chávez's foreign policy shifts, aligning with Cuba and arming Colombian insurgents, had angered some military leaders. His war on the elites turned out to carry risks.
The coup leaders overstepped, dissolving the Constitution and legislature, sparking counterprotests that quickly returned Mr. Chávez to power.
But his message of a revolutionary struggle against internal enemies no longer felt like a metaphor for reducing poverty.
Mr. Carey called it a "hugely polarizing moment" that allowed Mr. Chávez to portray the opposition as "trying to sell Venezuelan interests out."
He and his supporters now saw politics as a zero-sum battle for survival. Independent institutions came to be seen as sources of intolerable danger.
The licenses of critical media outlets were suspended. When labor unions protested, they were weakened by blacklists or replaced outright. When courts challenged Mr. Chávez, he gutted them, suspending unfriendly judges and packing the Supreme Court with loyalists.
The result was intense polarization between two segments of society who now saw each other as existential threats, destroying any possibility of compromise.
Converting Oil Into Loyalty
Shortly after the coup, Mr. Chávez faced another battle that would prove just as fateful. Workers went on strike at the state-run oil firm, Petróleos de Venezuela, or PDVSA, which he had long denounced for its associations with business elites and the United States.
The strike threatened to destroy the economy and Mr. Chávez's presidency. But it also presented an opportunity to stave off another uprising.
After the strike collapsed, he fired 18,000 PDVSA workers, many of them skilled technicians and managers, and replaced them with some 100,000 supporters.
Much of the firm's operating budget was diverted into programs for Mr. Chávez's political base, payoffs for government cronies and subsidies to keep his promise of affordable food.
In 2011, $500 million from a PDVSA pension fund found its way into a pyramid scheme run by government-linked financiers, none of whom faced prosecution. After running on smashing the corrupt elite, Mr. Chávez had merely established his own.
As an oil company, PDVSA was ruined. Production dropped despite a global boom in oil prices. The injury rate, measured in lost man-hours, more than tripled.
In 2012, a refinery exploded, killing at least 40 and causing $1.7 billion in damage, suggesting that even maintenance budgets had been siphoned.
Its cash reserves depleted and development projects stalled, PDVSA, and by extension the Venezuelan economy, was left without a cushion when oil prices dropped in 2014.
Mr. Chávez had set up Venezuela for not just economic collapse but also a political crisis. If his support relied on oil-fueled patronage, what would happen when the money ran out?
Replacing Urban Unrest With Urban Chaos
The 2002 coup taught Mr. Chávez that an alliance of convenience with armed groups known as colectivos could help him control the streets where protesters had almost brought him down.
The colectivos, funneled money and arms from the state, became political enforcers. Protesters learned to fear these men, who arrived on Chinese-made motorcycles to disperse them, often lethally.
The colectivos grew in power, challenging the police for control. In 2005, they expelled the police from a region of Caracas, the capital, that had tens of thousands of residents.
Though the government never officially approved such violence, it publicly praised colectivos, granting them tacit impunity. Many exploited this freedom to participate in organized crime.
Alejandro Velasco, a New York University professor who studies colectivos, said the groups were later joined by criminal "opportunists" who learned that "adding a little ideology to their operations" could win them impunity.
Criminality and lawlessness flourished, spiking murder rates.
Selling Off the Economy
President Nicolás Maduro, who took power when Mr. Chávez died in 2013, inherited an economy that was a shambles and tenuous support among elites and the public.
In desperation, he parceled out patronage. The military, with which he had less sway than his predecessor, got control of lucrative drug and food trades, as well as gold mining.
Unable to pay for subsidies and welfare programs, he printed more money. When this drove up inflation, making basic goods unaffordable, he instituted price controls and fixed the currency exchange rate.
This made many imports prohibitively expensive. Businesses shut down. Mr. Maduro printed more money, and inflation grew again. Food became scarce. Unrest deepened, and Mr. Maduro's survival grew more contingent on handouts he could not afford.
This cycle destroyed Venezuela's economy.
It also worsened street violence. With government stores empty, black markets mushroomed. Colectivos, less reliant on government support, took command of the informal economy in some areas. They grew more violent and harder to rein in.
Mr. Maduro tried to restore order in 2015, deploying heavily armed police and military units. But the operations became "blood baths," Mr. Velasco said. Many officers turned to criminality themselves.
Neither Democracy Nor Dictatorship
The political system, after years of erosion, has become a hybrid of democratic and authoritarian features -- a highly unstable mix, scholars say.
Its internal rules can shift day to day. Rival power centers compete fiercely for control. Such systems have proved far likelier to experience a coup or collapse.
Mr. Maduro has struggled, as leaders of such hybrid systems often do, to assert control.
Without Mr. Chávez's personal connections or deep pockets, Mr. Maduro has little leverage with authoritarian elements dominated by political and military elites. Because he is deeply unpopular, his hold over democratic institutions may be even weaker.
After opposition groups won control of the legislature in 2015, tension between those two systems exploded into outright conflict. The Supreme Court, stacked with loyalists, briefly sought to dissolve the legislature's powers. This month, Mr. Maduro said he might seek a new Constitution.
Venezuela's paradox, Mr. Levitsky said, is that the government is too authoritarian to coexist with democratic institutions, but too weak to abolish them without risking collapse.
Protesters have spilled into streets, but appear deadlocked with security forces and colectivos. Francisco Toro, a Venezuelan political scientist, said it was unclear whose side the military would take if called to intervene.
With neither side able to exert control, little in the way of an economy or public order to take over, and a political system seemingly unable to break or bend, Venezuela has brought itself from wealth and democracy to the brink of collapse.

Full text: It has taken 10 years, but the job market for young college graduates has largely recovered to where it was in 2007, before the Great Recession. The recent unemployment rate for college graduates ages 21 to 24 was 5.6 percent, basically the same as in 2007. The wages of young college graduates have also recovered, to $19.18 an hour. For the college Class of 2017, those improvements offer a better starting point than was true for those who graduated in earlier post-recession classes. What they don't guarantee, however, is prosperity. While the labor market for young college graduates has improved from its recession-era lows, it is still not showing robust signs of full employment, in which everyone who wants a job has one, prices are stable and wages are rising.
To take one example of labor market weakness, underemployment among young college graduates is still elevated, with 9.9 percent "idled" or "sidelined," compared with 8.4 percent in 2007, according to research by the Economic Policy Institute. These graduates are not counted as unemployed because they are neither working nor looking for work. Nor are they enrolled in further education. Another sign of underemployment is the share of recent college graduates who work in jobs that do not require a college degree. Recently, 43.5 percent of college graduates ages 22 to 27 were in "non-college" jobs, compared with 41.8 percent in 2007, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
Elevated underemployment indicates the absence of professional job opportunities, which in turn acts as a brake on wage growth. Worse, job challenges among college-educated workers generally mean even tougher times for black and Hispanic graduates, as well as for young people who do not go to college.
College graduates who are members of racial and ethnic minorities have far higher unemployment rates and underemployment rates than white college graduates. Racial discrimination is an unavoidable explanation for the discrepancy.
Young people with only high school degrees fare even worse. The recent unemployment rate of high school graduates ages 17 to 20 was 16.9 percent, compared with 15.9 percent in 2007; their average wage recently came to $10.89 an hour, which is less than in 2007 when adjusted for inflation. This dire situation results in part because college-educated workers are competing for some of the same lower-paying jobs.
The Class of 2017 -- both college and high school graduates -- is coming of age in an economy that is still enfeebled by the serial busts of this century and the failure of government to pick up the slack with more robust policies. These young people deserve better. They deserve a legal and regulatory system that safeguards against boom-and-bust cycles. They deserve federal investment in infrastructure, clean energy and scientific research that creates jobs and lays the foundation for prosperity. They deserve increased resources for public-sector jobs that require college degrees, notably teaching. They deserve a tax system that collects enough revenue to ensure health care, child care and secure retirement.
Will they get it?

Full text: In the years since Ukraine's revolution ushered in a pro-Western government, the United States, the International Monetary Fund and other donors loosened the purse strings to offer Kiev foreign aid. But at the same time, anticorruption groups have been raising questions over where those billions of dollars have gone, concerns that have been amplified after Ukraine's central bank chief resigned amid an investigation into a bailout of the country's largest bank, a lender once owned by a pro-government oligarch.
The stakes are high, with Ukraine heavily dependent on foreign financial help as it grapples with the loss of about 12 percent of its territory and nearly a fifth of its gross domestic product as a result of its war with Russia.
Valeriya O. Gontareva, the governor of Ukraine's central bank, announced her resignation last month and officially stepped down on Thursday. She insisted in an interview that she was quitting because she was satisfied that she had pushed through the necessary changes to get the country's economy on track.
But her resignation comes after the authorities opened an inquiry in March into the central bank's operations. The government in December spent $5.6 billion on a recapitalization of PrivatBank, which is owned by Ihor V. Kolomoisky -- the pro-Kiev commander of a battle-hardened militia and the governor of a crucial region that is on the front line of the Russian conflict.
Ms. Gontareva, who took the post in 2014, closed half of Ukraine's private banks. That was part of efforts to carry out a "total revamp of the Ukrainian banking system," she said in a recent interview.
Not everyone was pleased with her efforts. At one point during her tenure, she found a coffin dumped outside her home.
Among the moves she oversaw were deals offering PrivatBank central bank refinancing to strengthen the lender's balance sheet. But at least $1.8 billion of that money quickly vanished into bad loans, according to the Anti-Corruption Action Center, an independent organization tracking fraud in Ukraine that is financed in part by United States government grants. By December, PrivatBank faced a huge capital shortfall.
"When I opened their books as governor of the central bank, I was shocked," Ms. Gontareva said. "Instead of real assets, they have just shells."
PrivatBank, with nearly a third of Ukraine's individual bank deposits, was too big to fail, particularly in a country destabilized by war. The government in Kiev soon stepped in with the $5.6 billion bailout, nationalizing the lender.
Through it all, Mr. Kolomoisky was financing a major anti-Russian militia in the war in eastern Ukraine. The militia, called Dnepro-1, remains well regarded by Ukrainian soldiers and was crucial in holding parts of the front line before the regular army could be transformed into a battle-ready state.
That support for the militia insulated his business activity from aggressive oversight by the government he was defending militarily, said Tymofiy Mylovanov, president of the Kiev School of Economics. "People respect him for helping to save Ukraine," Mr. Mylovanov said.
But the collapse and rescue of PrivatBank have raised questions over whether Ukraine can adequately manage its economy and safeguard the funds from its $17.5 billion I.M.F. program, as well as billions more in bilateral lending. The PrivatBank bailout alone cost Ukraine the equivalent of 5 percent of its gross domestic product, according to Standard & Poor's, the rating agency.
While the I.M.F. and other lenders attached conditions to that money, they were largely tied to economic and political reforms. Of the about $8.3 billion that has so far been disbursed, $2.7 billion was handed to the government for budget support and the remainder transferred to the central bank to bolster currency reserves. The bailout of PrivatBank has cost the government more than the entire I.M.F. budget aid received since the 2014 revolution.
Instead, the I.M.F. mandated the creation of an independent anticorruption watchdog. On March 29, agents from that body searched the central bank's headquarters as part of a half dozen criminal inquiries into "misuses or misappropriation," of central bank funds, including one looking specifically at possible wrongdoing by central bank employees, according to a spokeswoman.
Independent anticorruption groups say the March raid was related to accusations of impropriety over refinancing deals with failing, oligarch-controlled lenders, like PrivatBank.
Ms. Gontareva has protested her innocence and said bank closings during her tenure had in fact put an end to refinancing fraud in Ukraine. She said that the central bank had forwarded recommendations for criminal prosecutions for loan fraud to the authorities but that with the judicial system still largely unreformed, few cases had made it to court.
"Sad to say, some of these loans were extended with the full knowledge that they would never be paid back," said Frank Gill, an analyst with Standard & Poor's. "That is how things worked in the past, and Governor Gontareva had the unenviable task of cleaning that up."
The former central bank chief blamed criticism of her work in the Ukrainian media, and the death threats, on disgruntled businessmen unhappy with her efforts to close banks. She described the corruption investigation as "nothing special" and said it was one of several audits and reviews of the central bank.
She said she had carried out tough reforms, reducing the bloated size of the central bank's staff, which at one point numbered 12,000; slashed inflation to single digits from 43 percent in 2015; and moved the country to a more flexible foreign exchange system.
Ms. Gontareva said she was planning to take some time off and re-enter the private sector -- she previously worked for a brokerage firm in Ukraine -- adding that she hoped never to be a bureaucrat again.
A former spokesman for Mr. Kolomoisky, Borys Braginsky, said in a telephone interview that he had no means of contacting the businessman. He added that Mr. Kolomoisky had not retained a new spokesman and could not be reached for comment.
With so much money at stake, political pressure is mounting on the Ukrainian anticorruption watchdog, which is investigating the central bank and which last summer revealed secret payments in Ukraine to President Trump's then campaign manager, Paul J. Manafort. Rival factions in Parliament have clashed over the appointment of an outside auditor to the organization.
The I.M.F. has now tightened its conditions for lending.
In February, it listed the creation of an anticorruption court, free from political interference, as a benchmark for future disbursements. It said in written replies to questions that it was considering elevating some requirements from benchmarks to "prior action" demands, or conditions that a country must meet before the fund's board will even convene to consider releasing a new tranche of funding.
There is little dispute that the central bank had to close several shaky banks in Ukraine, said Daria M. Kaleniuk, the executive director of the Anti-Corruption Action Center. But the hefty cost to Ukrainian taxpayers and Western donors, including the United States, was most likely too high because the failing banks -- most disastrously PrivatBank -- were refinanced shortly before they collapsed.
The eventual loss from PrivatBank, Ms. Kaleniuk said, should have been obvious to the central bank before it cost donors and taxpayers billions.
"This scheme could have been noticed by the central bank and by Gontareva," Ms. Kaleniuk said. "The problem is, nobody has been punished yet for such a huge fraud."

Full text: Allan H. Meltzer, an influential conservative economist who strongly opposed government bailouts and was credited with coining the anti-bailout slogan, "Capitalism without failure is like religion without sin," died on Monday in Pittsburgh. He was 89. Marvin Goodfriend, a professor of economics at Carnegie Mellon University and a colleague of Dr. Meltzer's there, confirmed the death, at Shadyside Hospital. Dr. Meltzer taught at the Tepper School of Business at Carnegie Mellon and, at his death, held a professorship there in political economy that was named for him.
Throughout his career Dr. Meltzer was a consultant to congressional committees, the Federal Reserve System, the Treasury Department, foreign governments and central banks, advocating a hands-off approach to economic affairs, even in the face of fiscal failures.
"The reason he was one of the greatest economists in the 20th century is because he played a leading role in persuading the Federal Reserve to end the great inflation with disciplined monetary policy," Dr. Goodfriend said, referring to the late 1960s to the early 1980s.
Under President Ronald Reagan, Dr. Meltzer was an acting member of the President's Council of Economic Advisers. In its 1989 report to Congress, the council recommended that the government resist the impulse to respond to every "perceived social need" with financial intervention.
In 1999 and 2000 he was chairman of a congressional commission -- informally called the Meltzer Commission -- that examined how the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank had responded to the 1997-98 financial crisis, in which a sharp devaluation of Southeast Asian currencies beginning in July 1997 rippled across the global economy, affecting markets in the United States, Europe and Latin America.
In its report, the panel criticized both bodies as being bureaucratically bloated, doing more harm than good in the developing world and wasting billions of dollars making loans to middle-income countries, which it said could rely on private capital. It recommended that the I.M.F. and the World Bank be radically reduced and overhauled.
As recently as a few months ago, Dr. Meltzer opposed aiding governments and industries facing economic hardship.
His economic philosophy has found renewed favor in the Trump administration. A protégé, Adam Lerrick, who helped Dr. Meltzer with his I.M.F. and World Bank report, has been nominated as deputy under secretary for international finance in the Treasury Department.
In books like "Why Capitalism?" (2012), Dr. Meltzer promoted the view that countries and investors should suffer the consequences of their mistakes, whether flawed fiscal measures or bad lending decisions.
In coining the slogan "Capitalism without failure is like religion without sin," he added another maxim: "Bankruptcies and losses concentrate the mind on prudent behavior."
Allan Harold Meltzer was born on Feb. 6, 1928, in Boston to George Meltzer and the former Minerva Simon. His mother died when he was 6, and his father later remarried.
Allan attended the Boys' Latin School and Brookline High School in Massachusetts. He earned a bachelor's degree in economics from Duke University in 1948 and received master's and doctoral degrees in economics from the University of California, Los Angeles.
In 1957 he became an assistant professor at the Carnegie Mellon Graduate School of Industrial Administration, later named the Tepper School of Business.
Dr. Meltzer's economic influence stretched decades. In 1973, he helped found the private Shadow Open Market Committee with Karl Brunner of the University of Rochester. The panel offered policy recommendations to the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee.
He received many awards for his work, including the Harry Truman Medal for Public Policy and the Truman Medal for Economic Policy.
Dr. Meltzer's conservative economic views were not without detractors. A notable one was Paul Krugman, the Nobel laureate in economics and liberal columnist for The New York Times. In a blog post in 2013 concerning a policy disagreement that he and Dr. Meltzer had four years earlier, Mr. Krugman wrote, "He made a monetary prediction; I made a monetary prediction; his prediction was wrong."
Dr. Meltzer wrote more than 10 books, including the comprehensive multivolume "A History of the Federal Reserve."
He is survived by his wife, the former Marilyn Ginsburg; two sons, Bruce and Eric; a daughter, Beth MacIsaac; a half sister from his father's second marriage, Maxine Smith; and eight grandchildren.
In recent years Mr. Meltzer found a new interest in law and regulation. He and other scholars were working on a book, "Regulation and the Rule of Law."

British Labour Party Set To Take Sharp Left Turn

Full text: After years of contesting Britain's political center ground, the opposition Labour Party agreed Thursday afternoon on what is likely to be its most left-wing election manifesto in more than three decades, complete with some eye-catching policies intended to shore up its core vote. The document will be published next week, but a draft was widely leaked on Thursday as about 80 members of a Labour committee prepared to meet to discuss it. The draft revealed plans to renationalize some rail and energy companies, scrap university tuition fees and put in place big increases in spending on health and social care.
Later, Labour's leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said that the manifesto had been approved in an amended form by a party committee, but he would not say which elements had changed.
"Our manifesto will be an offer, and we believe the policies in it are very popular," Mr. Corbyn said, adding that there had been unanimous agreement on a program that would "transform the lives of many people in our society."
The leaked draft -- initially published by The Daily Mirror, The Daily Telegraph, the BBC and other news outlets -- suggested that Mr. Corbyn, a left-wing politician, had broken decisively with the centrist legacy of most of his recent Labour predecessors, most notably with that of former Prime Minister Tony Blair, who won three general elections.
Instead, Mr. Corbyn's strategy contains echoes of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who ignited liberal passions in his unsuccessful race for the Democratic presidential nomination last year. Labour's manifesto also serves the more prosaic function of shoring up the party's core vote as it approaches a difficult electoral contest on June 8.
Motivating those supporters, and achieving a decent election result, could be crucial for Mr. Corbyn, who says he wants to stay on as leader, even if he loses, as pollsters predict.
A spokesman for Labour, reached by telephone on Thursday, declined to authenticate the document, saying the party's policy was not to comment on leaks. But Andrew Gwynne, Labour's national elections and campaign coordinator, speaking to the BBC on Thursday morning, did not deny the document's authenticity.
Labour has not yet outlined how it would pay for its pledges, though Mr. Gwynne said that all costs would be accounted for when the final manifesto document was published next week.
The Conservatives and Labour's other opponents seized on the leak as evidence that the party lacked discipline.
"This is a total shambles," the Conservative Party said in a statement. "Jeremy Corbyn's plans to unleash chaos on Britain have been revealed. Jobs will be lost, families will be hit, and our economic security damaged for a generation if Jeremy Corbyn and the coalition of chaos are ever let anywhere near the keys to Downing Street."
Britons will vote on June 8 in a snap general election called by Prime Minister Theresa May. Mrs. May wants to increase her slim parliamentary majority before negotiating Britain's withdrawal from the European Union, known as "Brexit." According to surveys, her Conservative Party is well ahead of Labour.
Mr. Corbyn remains unpopular, even among many of his own lawmakers; last year, some tried unsuccessfully to unseat him. There have been fewer public displays recently of party divisions, but the leak of the draft manifesto was a reminder that a lack of unity still exists in the party just weeks before the election.
The leaked document, nevertheless, gives a clear indication of the type of campaign that Labour is likely to pursue, and the clear political dividing lines it will create. For years, Labour's left-wing politicians have argued that the party has been unsuccessful because it has not offered voters a sufficiently radical alternative to Conservative policies, and that theory looks likely to be tested in the coming elections.
The draft says that Labour would renew the Trident nuclear submarine system, which Mr. Corbyn has opposed, but that any Labour prime minister would be "extremely cautious" about deploying it. There would be a ban on so-called zero-hours contracts, under which employers are not obliged to offer employees a minimum amount of work.
The Royal Mail would be renationalized, as would rail companies; and the draft proposed caps on energy prices. Mr. Gwynne also said that in each region there should be a state-run energy company.
On leaving the European Union, the document says that Labour "will reject 'no deal' " as "viable," a departure from Mrs. May's stance; she has threatened to walk away from negotiations with the bloc if she does not get the accord she wants.
The draft also proposes raising income taxes for the top 5 percent of earners to fund greater spending on health care. John McDonnell, Labour's economics spokesman, has suggested that those earning more than 80,000 pounds, or just over $100,000, would be asked for a "modest" increase in tax payments, with bigger increases for those who earn £150,000 or more.
Over all, the agenda suggests that Labour's primary objective is to shore up its core vote to avoid a big defeat, rather than seeking to persuade any wavering Conservative supporters.
Mrs. May, for her part, has promised to spend more on defense, announcing that a Conservative government would meet its NATO spending target but would also increase the military budget "by at least 0.5 percent above inflation in every year."
The Conservatives were not the only ones to deride the leaked manifesto. Tommy Sheppard, a lawmaker for the Scottish National Party, said in a statement, "The very fact that this draft manifesto has been leaked shows how divided and chaotic the Labour Party are."
(As if the leak were not enough, as Mr. Corbyn arrived on Thursday for the meeting to discuss the manifesto, the car in which he was traveling ran over the foot of a BBC cameraman, the broadcaster reported. The cameraman, Giles Wooltorton, has been hospitalized.)
Most observers say they believe Labour's new manifesto is the most left-wing since the 1983 general election, when the party lost badly. That platform included more-sweeping nationalization and unilateral nuclear disarmament, and one Labour lawmaker at the time described the 1983 manifesto as "the longest suicide note in history."

Spain's Solution on Health Care

Full text: JACKSONVILLE, FLA. -- First came the Affordable Care Act, then the American Health Care Act -- time and again, politicians talk about controlling health care costs but end up missing the point. Based on the historical rate of inflation, health care spending could could consume nearly 50 percent of gross domestic product in 30 years -- an unsustainable trend that can't be solved through changing the insurance landscape.
The A.C.A., or Obamacare, focused on expanding coverage, with very little to address cost of care in the early stages. That was a fatal flaw: Voters saw already expensive health care costs rise and were unhappy being forced into the system.
The A.H.C.A., which the House passed last week, focuses on the cost of coverage, but in the wrong way. Cutting billions from Medicaid will reduce government expenditures, but only by cutting care for millions of people. The move back to underwriting for pre-existing conditions will reduce the cost of insurance for healthy people but will drastically increase the cost of insurance for people with underlying health problems.
Instead, we have to tackle insurance itself. In the United States, we pay a large amount of money to insurance companies for the privilege of being the middleman in uninsurable primary care transactions.
Other industrialized countries, where health care costs per capita are less than half of what they are in America, offer lessons. Americans spend about 25 percent to 30 percent on administrative costs; if we brought that in line with those other countries, to about 15 percent, we could save about $320 billion of the $3 trillion our country spends on health care.
Countries that provide good primary care have better health outcomes and lower costs because they provide efficient care of common and chronic illnesses. In America, the high cost of medical education, a reimbursement system that favors specialists and a poorly supported primary care network have decimated our primary care work force.
In the 1980s, Spain created taxpayer-funded community health centers located within a 15-minute radius of every citizen. This dramatically improved health measures and provided a good base of primary care for everyone in the country.
In the United States, community health centers could be funded directly by the government based on population, not fee for service. They would provide a broad, well-defined range of services, including primary care, with weekend and evening hours, telemedicine, basic pharmaceuticals and education for management of chronic illness. Mental health care would be provided, including management of drug addiction. And they could serve as a base for managing crises such as epidemics and bioterrorism events.
Anyone could use a community health center without income verification, free. People could still use private primary care providers, but they would have to pay for them, directly. Insurance would be reserved for emergencies, through inexpensive catastrophic coverage. Even Medicaid and Medicare could eventually be moved into a catastrophic-only model.
Such centers already exist throughout the country, many providing state-of-the-art primary, mental and dental care for low-income people at about $1,000 each a year. At that price, the entire country could be covered for $325 billion a year.
The savings would more than pay for the program: Right now, the government spends $250 billion a year on tax credits for employer-based coverage. Since insurance costs would decrease significantly, the revenue lost by this credit would decrease proportionately. And about 11 percent of Medicare payments are for physician services and another 27 percent are for Medicare Advantage payments, totaling $240 billion per year. Since a good chunk of that is for primary care, it could be diverted to community health care services.
America has spent almost a decade making dramatic changes in its health insurance system, without addressing the real problem. We have the capacity to tackle the underlying costs with a tried-and-true solution. The only question is, do we have the political will?

Full text: C. Jackson Grayson, a business school dean who was named by President Richard M. Nixon to oversee the nation's first peacetime price control program, died on Thursday at his home in Houston. He was 93. His death was confirmed by the American Productivity & Quality Center, or APQC, a research and training group he founded in Houston.
Nixon's price control effort began in 1971, when he was armed with congressional authority to curb runaway inflation, which had reached nearly 6 percent over all and even double digits for some goods. That August he imposed a brief wage and price freeze, followed by voluntary guidelines of 5.5 percent a year for pay and 2.5 percent for prices. He set up the Price Commission as part of that effort.
Dr. Grayson was dean of the business school of Southern Methodist University in Dallas when Nixon appointed him chairman of the panel. Reporting to the president, Dr. Grayson was empowered to act without the vote of other commission members, though he would solicit their advice.
During the first year of controls, Dr. Grayson said, consumer prices were held to a 3.2 percent increase; without them, he said, the rise would have been as much as 5.2 percent. By the time the so-called Phase II voluntary guidelines were lifted for most of the economy in January 1973, the annual inflation rate was below 4 percent.
He left the post in 1973 and returned to S.M.U.
Other price regulations were imposed after that, but Congress let the president's authority to impose controls lapse altogether in April 1974.
By then, Dr. Grayson had become skeptical of the efficacy of controls and maintained that inflation resulted, in part, from a psychosomatic reaction by shoppers to measurements of the temperature of the economy.
Dr. Grayson founded his research group in 1977, originally as the American Productivity Center, offering training courses in improving worker output, helping companies better measure productivity, and extending proficiency goals beyond the private sector to other areas, like school systems.
"Few, if any, individual Americans have done more during the last 20 years to shape the country's economic future for the better," Business Week magazine said of Dr. Grayson in 1990.
Charles Jackson Grayson Jr. was born on Oct. 8, 1923, in Fort Necessity, in northeastern Louisiana. Until he was 15, he was raised as a farm boy on his father's Louisiana plantation, where Charles Sr. grew cotton and soy beans and raised race horses. As a student at Georgia Military Academy, Charles Jr. danced with Vivien Leigh at the Atlanta gala premiere of "Gone With the Wind."
He served in the Navy in the South Pacific during World War II and earned a bachelor's degree in business administration from Tulane University, a master's from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and a doctorate from Harvard Business School.
After getting his master's, he decided that he did not want to be an accountant and took a career detour, first working as a reporter in 1949 for The New Orleans Item, where he relished covering crime.
That fascination led him to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, where he became an agent, his only other government job. In one instance he was held hostage at gunpoint after a carjacking in Minneapolis.
Returning to the academic fold, he taught at Tulane and became dean of its business school.
Dr. Grayson owned race horses, was licensed to pilot a single-engine plane, had visited all seven continents by the time he was 80 and celebrated his 75th and 90th birthdays by sky diving.
He was not enrolled as either a Republican or a Democrat, although he said he voted for Nixon for president in 1968.
His first three marriages ended in divorce. In addition to his wife, Carla O'Dell, the chairwoman and chief executive of APQC, he is survived by three sons from the earlier marriages, Christopher, Michael and Randall, and four grandchildren. Another son, Daniel, died.
In founding APQC, Dr. Grayson warned that the United States was trailing other industrial nations in productivity, or output per worker, a key measure of economic health.
"Productivity is something like motherhood," he told The New York Times in 1980. "Everybody believes in it but most people ignore it."

Full text: The jobless rate dropped to 4.4 percent in April, the lowest level in more than a decade, the government said on Friday, signaling the economy's resilience and showing a labor market closing in on full capacity. Employers added 211,000 workers, the Labor Department said, helping to quell doubts raised by sluggish growth in the first quarter and anemic hiring in March.
The economic anxiety and uneven fortunes that figured so prominently in the presidential campaign have not disappeared, particularly outside of the country's flourishing urban centers. Wage growth was also modest, with the year-over-year increase staying just baby steps ahead of inflation.
But some of the labor force's weakest corners improved, with declines in the ranks of discouraged workers and of those working part time who would prefer full-time jobs. The average monthly gain in jobs since February reached 174,000.
"Great news," Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta said Friday morning on Twitter, adding in a later statement that further work was needed "on bridging the skills gap and on expanding opportunity."
Republicans were not alone in paying homage to the labor market's strength.
"The momentum in the job market is really impressive," said Jason Furman, the chief economic adviser during the Obama administration. "I'm frankly surprised that this late into an expansion the economy is still adding jobs well above the steady-state pace."
The April figures renewed a conversation among economists about whether the economy was at "full employment," the point at which everyone who wants a job can get one at the current level of pay.
There was less agreement on who deserved the credit. Republicans crowed about how many jobs had been created since President Trump took office in January, while Democrats pointed to the ongoing economic legacy of President Barack Obama.
Three months is still a short span in the life of an administration, and Mr. Trump has not yet pushed through the main planks of his pro-growth agenda like tax reform or a large investment in infrastructure. Even so, some economists gave the president credit for a jump in optimism.
"Sharp increases in consumer and business confidence can have real consequences that show up in increased hiring and investment," said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office who advised Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, during his 2008 presidential campaign.
Mr. Holtz-Eakin added that Mr. Trump's freezing of new regulations and elimination of others were having a measurable impact.
"The observed pace of regulatory activity has come to a standstill," he said. In contrast, he argued, a persistent rollout of regulations by the Obama administration had added millions of dollars in costs for businesses each week.
Another major factor in the economy's performance is, of course, the Federal Reserve Board, which put a confident stamp on the economy this week and plans to raise interest rates further this year.
The jobs report on Friday strengthens that case, though another report is due before Fed policy makers meet again in June. And the wide swing between March's disappointing jobs growth figure, which was revised to 79,000, and April's vibrant one was a useful reminder that every monthly jobs report provides only a temporary and incomplete snapshot of the economy.
Whatever effect Mr. Trump's policies are having so far, economists agree that presidents always tend to be given much more responsibility for the economy's ups and downs than they deserve. "We have a big, big economy and the overall shape is made by millions and millions of individual decisions," said Michael Strain, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. "We tend to give too much emphasis to role of the president."
Certainly, the administration's solidly pro-business agenda has buoyed many executives. At the same time, they have steadily complained about a growing shortage of workers.
"It's not an employer's market," said Patrick Bass, chief executive of Thyssenkrupp North America, which makes elevators, steel and other industrial products.
Based in Germany, Thyssenkrupp employs more than 15,000 people in the United States, but "the labor market is very competitive at all levels," Mr. Bass said. "We have more positions open than we've been able to fill."
Yet if shortages were as acute as advertised, then wages would be bid up at a faster rate. Average hourly earnings, though, rose by 0.3 percent in April, bringing the year-over-year growth to 2.5 percent. Last year at this time, increases were the same but inflation was lower, further shrinking the impact of any wage increases.
Employers must decide whether to buy skills or to build them, said Michael Stull, a senior vice president at the staffing company Manpower North America. The small pressure on wages, he said, is evidence that they have been trying to buy them, but more businesses are expressing an interest in partnerships with educational institutions or in developing skills so that new hires "can earn while they learn."
Workers with fewer skills or less experience can often be hired at a cut rate. Some may have come from the ranks of part-time workers who want full-time jobs and of those who had previously been too discouraged to look. There was a sharp drop last month in the broader measure of unemployment, which includes individuals in both categories, to 8.6 percent from 8.9 percent. That is close to the prerecession rate.
Less encouraging was a dip in the proportion of adults who have a job or want one. That measure, known as the labor participation rate, edged down to 62.9 percent last month from 63 percent, a sign that workers who had been sidelined are not being drawn back into the labor market.
"This gets to be the real issue," said Diane Swonk, founder of DS Economics in Chicago. "As good as this report is, it points to how hard it is to bring in those marginalized workers. With skills erosion, people in long-term unemployment have gotten into a vicious cycle. An incoming tide does not lift all boats."
And the divisions among Republicans in Washington that have left the future of the Affordable Care Act uncertain even after the House vote on Thursday to repeal it have put some employers in a wait-and-see mode.
Ms. Swonk noted, for example, that while hiring in health care and social-assistance jobs was up by 37,000, the monthly average in the sector was down from last year at the same time. "Health care employment since the beginning of the year is not the driver it once was," Ms. Swonk said, calling it a "residual of uncertainty regarding health care coverage."
(The biggest gains were found in the leisure and hospitality sectors. "They're not buying cars, but they're buying vacations," Mr. Swonk said.)
Owners of small and medium-size businesses tell pollsters that they are optimistic about the economy, despite several weak economic indicators, said Catherine Barrera, an economics professor at Cornell University and the chief economic adviser for ZipRecruiter, an online jobs platform. But many employers have yet to act on their stated intentions to add workers. "The thing that stands out most," Ms. Barrera said, is the "gap between that optimism and the follow-through on that optimism."
Matthew Dolly, director of research at Transwestern, a national commercial real estate firm, said: "Businesses want to hire and planned on hiring. But until policies are ironed out, hiring will remain stagnant for a bit while that happens."
Even after a policy is carried out, it can take time before the effect kicks in. When it comes to individual tax cuts, for example, consumers have historically started to spend only when the extra money is in hand, not when it is promised, said William Gale, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.
Gauging the impact on businesses is much more complicated.
"We generally think it takes about a decade for the economic effects of a tax plan to fully phase in," said Kyle Pomerleau, director of federal projects at the conservative Tax Foundation.
And maybe not even then, given how many variables affect investment and the economy, said Alan Viard, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.
"You might never be able to pin down what happened due to the tax cut, as there would be no way to know what would have happened without the tax cut," he said. "We can't observe the path not taken."

Fed Holds Rates, But Stays Positive

Full text: WASHINGTON -- A few pieces of disappointing economic news in recent weeks have not shaken the Federal Reserve's confidence that the economy is in good health. The Fed, as expected, did not raise rates on Wednesday after a two-day meeting of its policy-making committee. But it remains likely to raise rates in the coming months.
The Action
The Federal Reserve left its benchmark rate in a range from 0.75 percent to 1 percent.
Officials are not worried about the slow pace of growth during the first three months of the year. The Fed said the slowdown was "likely to be transitory," meaning it expects a rebound.
The Fed remains on course to raise rates at least two more times this year. Investors expect an increase at the Fed's next meeting, on June 13 and 14.
The Takeaway
The government estimates that the economy grew at an annual pace of just 0.7 percent in the first quarter, and prices continue to rise more slowly than Fed officials would prefer.
But the Fed, in a statement issued Wednesday after the meeting of its committee, said the economy's engine was still looking good, even if the car was moving a little slowly.
Consumer spending, the bulk of economic activity, slowed in recent months, but the Fed's statement said "the fundamentals underpinning the continued growth of consumption remain solid."
So, too, for the broader economy. The Fed did not explain why it thought growth had slowed in the first quarter but said it continued to expect the economy would expand at a moderate pace.
The statement was backed by a unanimous vote of the Fed's policy-making committee, the Federal Open Market Committee.
The Background
Internal debates have been subdued in recent months; most Fed officials are in broad agreement on the economic outlook and the proper course of monetary policy.
The Fed raised its benchmark interest rate in December and again in March. Many investors are anticipating another rate increase at the committee's meeting in June.
The steady decline of unemployment is the primary reason the Fed is on the move. The unemployment rate fell to 4.5 percent in March, the lowest level since 2007. (The government is set to release the April jobs report on Friday.)
Most Fed officials have concluded that unemployment has returned to a normal level, and continued job growth will put upward pressure on inflation. But the Fed's benchmark rate remains at a level that supports growth by encouraging borrowing and risk taking.
Accordingly, the Fed wants to raise interest rates by the end of the year to a level that does not encourage or discourage growth.
Fed officials have also discussed the details and timing of ending a related stimulus program, the Fed's vast investments in Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities. The Fed has indicated it could begin to reduce those holdings by the end of the year.
There are, however, some reasons for hesitation. Despite the Fed's fears of future inflation, actual inflation remains stubbornly sluggish. The Fed's preferred gauge of price pressures, the Commerce Department's index of personal consumption expenditures excluding food and energy, rose 1.6 percent over the 12 months ending in March. The Fed would like prices to rise at an annual pace of 2 percent.
The Fed is less concerned about the slow pace of economic growth in the first quarter, perhaps because there is evidence the government has systematically underestimated first-quarter growth in recent years. Growth over the last 12 months has remained around 2 percent, the mediocre but steady pace the economy has maintained in recent years.
Janet L. Yellen, the Fed's chairwoman, said recently that the combination of rapid job growth and slow economic growth was "a big problem." The slow growth appears to reflect the slow pace of improvement in the productivity of the average American worker.
That, however, is a problem the Fed cannot solve by holding down rates.
The Reaction
The Fed's statement made little impression on financial markets. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 0.13 percent on the day, closing at 2,388.13. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury rose to 2.32 percent, from 2.29 percent. Investors also modestly increased their assessment of the chances that the Fed will raise rates in June -- to 70 percent, from about 67 percent.
Michael Feroli, chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase, noted the Fed's steady optimism, saying: "The postmeeting statement acknowledged the recent disappointments in growth and inflation but chose to view those developments in a favorable light. This glass-half-full statement leaves the door wide open to a June hike, provided, of course, that the recent data letdowns are indeed transitory."
Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays, said the Fed's confidence in the face of disappointment was a recent shift.
"In the past, a soft patch in the data or a shift in market sentiment caused the Fed to alter course," he said, adding, "The new Fed seems driven to lead and, at least for the moment, to be determined to follow its chosen path."

Mr. Trump's Excellent Idea: Raise the Gas Tax

Full text: Every once in a while, President Trump says something that really makes sense, as when he suggested on Monday raising the federal gasoline tax to help pay for his infrastructure plan. Hold on to that thought, Mr. President. It's a great idea. The federal fuel tax -- 18.4 cents per gallon for gasoline and 24.4 cents for diesel -- was supposed to pay to fix and expand the country's roads and transit systems, but Congress has refused to increase it since 1993. Between inflation and the higher fuel economy of cars, the tax is hardly up to the job. Highway-related tax revenue was only $37.4 billion in the 2015 fiscal year.
Small wonder then that many of the country's roads and transit systems are somewhere between shoddy and falling apart. The American Society of Civil Engineers recently gave the country's roads a grade of D and transit systems a D-. It said the poor state of the roads cost the country $160 billion in time and fuel in 2014. And the country's transit systems have a $90 billion repair backlog, according to a government report published in January.
Nobody really knows how serious Mr. Trump was when he floated the idea of raising the gas tax in an interview with Bloomberg News. His press secretary, Sean Spicer, realizing that the president might have touched the third rail of national Republican politics, quickly tried to scale back his comment, saying Mr. Trump was not endorsing a gas tax increase but merely considering it because the trucking industry had asked him to look into it. Still, even the fact that Mr. Trump is considering an increase is encouraging.
A higher gas tax is one way to help pay for Mr. Trump's $1 trillion infrastructure plan without increasing the federal deficit. It would benefit Americans by shortening their commutes, creating jobs and reducing costs for car repairs. Businesses would be able to ship raw materials and goods faster. All of that would bolster economic growth, which is probably why, in addition to truckers, the United States Chamber of Commerce and AAA support an increase.
Many states, tired of waiting for Washington, have raised fuel taxes. Just last month, lawmakers in California, Indiana, Montana and Tennessee voted for increases. Altogether, 21 states have done so since 2013, according to the American Road & Transportation Builders Association. But states cannot do the job alone. Many large infrastructure projects cross state lines and involve multiple modes of transportation, like road, freight rail and mass transit, putting them beyond the capacity of individual states.
Of course, there are substantial political obstacles to increasing the tax. Many conservatives, including the House speaker, Paul Ryan, and the anti-tax ideologue Grover Norquist, oppose the idea.
Mr. Trump has, so far, shown little interest in or aptitude for the kind of effort that gets legislation through Congress. He could seek some inspiration by looking to President Ronald Reagan, who in 1982 persuaded Congress to pass a 5-cent-a-gallon increase in the fuel tax. "The cost to the average motorist will be small," Reagan said, "but the benefit to our transportation system will be immense."

Full text: SYDNEY, Australia -- Let me tell you a fairy tale called Australia. Despite what you may have heard about snakes and spiders and sharks, the remarkable thing about Australia is not its danger but its safety. At its best, this is a peaceful nation, with health care and education for almost everyone, that has enjoyed over the past two decades the longest period of economic expansion of any developed country in modern history. Our cities are regularly judged to be among the most livable in the world. But we are in danger of stuffing it up, which is an Australian way of saying we may be ruining it all.
In the past 20 years, Australia has become a nation where getting ahead is a national obsession, partly because we have come to expect a world where the natural course of events is to become a little bit richer each year. The winnings of our repeated economic booms have been squandered on inflationary policies that fuel the rat race.
What we are discovering is that when you have a nation full of people trying to get to the top, eventually most of the population is forced to run just to keep up. Our enviable quality of life is at risk.
Consider what has happened with the housing market, Australia being a country where real estate is not just a place to live but a ticket to prosperity and a statement of taste and values.
Generous tax breaks for homeowners and real estate investors have fueled the market to the point where the median price of a house in Sydney, our largest metropolis, is $1.1 million Australian dollars, or about $824,000. An entire genre of newspaper writing is dedicated to telling Australians what they could buy for the same money in other parts of the world -- a small chateau in the South of France, even an apartment in Manhattan, for the price of an ugly brick house 40 minutes' drive from the center of the city. We watch shows like "Million Dollar Listing Los Angeles" and laugh.
So even though Australians do not have to put aside many hundreds of thousands of dollars for college degrees, or tens of thousands of dollars for health insurance, we are still in huge debt through our mortgages. Australia has some of the highest household debt in the world, especially if you compare our debt to our incomes and G.D.P. We are poised for disaster if there is a serious economic downturn.
Even for those lucky enough to own their own home, there is a fool's-gold feel to this property boom. After all, if you own a three-bedroom house five miles from the city and it increases in value by 50 percent, that means you still have only enough money to buy a three-bedroom house five miles from the city. This is not so much rising wealth as glorified inflation.
And for those who are not owners? The property boom is dividing the nation along lines of age and class. For young people, property prices represent dashed hopes and a looming intergenerational battle.
Consider a recent furor when an older demographer suggested in jest that young people would be better able to save for a house were they not wasting their money buying avocado toast at hipster cafes.
It is a familiar line of attack here, young people being told to stop wasting their money at cafes. No matter that you would need to forgo 31,429 flat whites to pay a 10 percent deposit on the typical home in Sydney.
Millennials, sick of being told that they don't know how good they have it, may well point out that Australia is home to some of the most spoiled baby boomers in the world. Many retirees divide their time between cruise holidays overseas and subsidized medical appointments here, all the time complaining that it is the young people who don't realize how good they have it.
Aside from tax policies that encourage speculation, other policies show successive governments have been fueling a rat race when they should have been building a society. Over the past two decades, federal government funding of private schools has expanded, including to those with very high fees and swimming pool complexes, beautiful gardens and performing arts centers, further dividing the country. Many middle-class parents have become anxious about sending children to the local public high school out of fear that they will lag behind their peers at schools that are expensive or academically selective.
We need to rediscover our egalitarian roots. It is true that Australian culture can be anti-intellectual. We can deride achievement and cut down those who succeed, in a phenomenon we call tall poppy syndrome. But the egalitarian values of our society should not be discounted. In fact, it is on the matter of egalitarianism that Australia has made some of its most important intellectual contributions to the world.
Australia was one of the first countries to institute a living minimum wage, in a famous court case back in 1907 regarding the employees of the Sunshine Harvester Works. The court decided that an unskilled worker should be paid enough to meet the needs of "a human being living in a civilized community," which included keeping his family in "frugal comfort."
The cultural effects of this decision, the idea that every worker should have a decent standard of living, have been at least as great as the legal ramifications.
Australia enjoys a relatively high minimum wage today of 17.70 Australian dollars, or about $13.25, per hour. We have so far avoided the hollowing out of the middle class suffered by other countries like the United States. Australia has one of the world's highest percentages of middle-class people, with about 56 percent of the population falling into this category, according to a 2016 Credit Suisse Global Wealth Report.
Egalitarianism has been a major contributing factor to the quality of life we enjoy in our society, including for those who are better off. We have low crime rates. Few of us fear that medical bills will lead to bankruptcy as we have universal health care. Our university fees are rising, but we can pay the money back to the government over time, and only once we are earning a decent wage.
We need to remember what makes Australia a fairy tale and protect it.

Full text: There is a worldwide glut that includes oil wells, steel plants and eager would-be workers, and it will take more than a United States presidential election and a few months of solid global growth to fix it. That, in a sentence, is the reality that haunts the world economy a third of the way through 2017.
For years, low inflation across most of the advanced world was part of a vicious cycle featuring onerous debt burdens and low growth. Major central banks struggled to lift inflation to the 2 percent annual rate they aim for.
Finally, after an uptick in oil prices in 2016 and an abrupt shift in sentiment after Donald J. Trump's election in November, it looked as if the world economy might be getting jolted out of that cycle. Some called it the Trumpflation effect. But it now seems that proclamations of victory were premature, and that the low-inflation world will be with us for at least a while longer.
In the eurozone, inflation reached 2 percent in the year ended in February for the first time since 2013. In the United States, a key inflation measure favored by the Federal Reserve passed over that 2 percent level for the first time in five years.
It appeared more of the same was on the way -- or at least that was the future that global investors started to account for. Bond prices last summer suggested consumer prices in the United States were expected to rise only 1.4 percent annually over the next five years; that soared to 1.96 percent in late January.
But now that assessment has partly reversed, with the same measure having fallen to 1.85 percent inflation expected over the next half-decade. Measures of core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy, have basically been stable for months. The one the Fed watches most closely, the year-over-year change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, has been at 1.75 percent for three straight months.
A big part of what has changed is that it looks clearer that the rise in inflation over the winter was driven by a one-time recovery in oil prices from lows in early 2016.
Oil prices have stabilized -- a barrel of West Texas Intermediate crude has hovered between about $48 and $54 since the start of December, up from as low as $26 in February 2016. There are few signs that oil will keep feeding a rise in overall prices in the months ahead.
Beyond oil patches, the underlying global dynamics are pushing in the direction of lower prices. There appears to be more worldwide capacity for major commodities like steel and aluminum than there is demand, in part because of China's sheltering of state-run enterprises from the vicissitudes of the marketplace. The integration of highly populous countries like China and India into the world economy continues apace, creating what may be a glut of workers.
Essentially, all the factors that have created downward pressure on prices throughout the 21st century continue to do so, regardless of what President Trump does or doesn't do.
Moreover, some of the Trump administration plans that seemed to point toward higher inflation and higher interest rates are looking like vaporware. A large-scale infrastructure investment program, for example, could push both interest rates and inflation higher in the United States. But so far the administration's focus on infrastructure has not translated to specific policy ideas.
The combination of powerful long-term forces and policy gridlock in Washington means that we probably won't see some magical moment when the low-inflation monster has been vanquished. Rather, the world is going to have to keep climbing out the hard way.
"We have turned the corner on low inflation," said Joseph Gagnon, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, describing that as his baseline expectation. "But future increases will be gradual and not without occasional setbacks. There are significant risks in both directions."
If the Trump administration delivers a bigger fiscal boost than is now priced into markets, that could fuel higher inflation; an unexpected spike in commodity prices would do the same. Geopolitical instability, such as open conflict with North Korea, could work in the opposite direction and push the world economy back toward deflation.
But absent something surprising, it looks as if the most likely course is a lengthy grinding process: The global demand for goods and services slowly rises until the supply glut gradually gives way to tighter labor markets, and the world economy becomes constrained by its industrial capacity.
That is already well underway in the United States, with its 4.5 percent unemployment rate and rising wages. If the economy works the way the textbooks say it should, that should feed back into higher incomes, higher consumer demand and higher prices in the months ahead.
It's a reminder that many of the biggest forces in the economy don't announce themselves with an election or a central banker's announcement, but through shifts in the underlying forces that make the global economy tick. And those don't change overnight.

Can a leftist bring growth to France?

Full text: WASHINGTON -- If the first round of the French presidential election on Sunday is now too close to call, that's partly because of Jean-Luc Mï¿½lenchon's last-minute surge in the polls. The media describe him as a populist from the far left, and as he has risen, attacks on him have intensified. One common criticism is that his economic proposal to jump-start growth in France while reducing mass unemployment and inequality is pie in the sky.
Is it, though?
Mr. Mï¿½lenchon would certainly face significant political hurdles if elected, including the need to build political support for his program in Parliament. But the French economy, despite serious problems, could sustain, as well as benefit from, his proposals.
He wants to reduce unemployment from 10 percent, its current level, to about 6 percent over the next five years, partly by increasing government spending by some 275 billion euros, or about 2.3 percent of G.D.P. The money would go to major public spending in renewable energy and environmental projects, housing and antipoverty programs, as well as toward lowering the retirement age and increasing wages in the public sector.
Mr. Mï¿½lenchon's critics say that France is already living beyond its means. The French enjoy a level of economic security and living standards that most Americans can only dream about: universal health care, free child care and public-university education, a 35-hour workweek, higher life expectancy, and lower per capita energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. The new government, say people who oppose Mr. Mï¿½lenchon's views, will have to focus on reducing the public debt.
But the numbers do not bear them out.
The most important measure of a country's public debt is the interest burden it must pay annually. The interest France currently pays on its debt amounts to 1.7 percent of G.D.P., which is modest by both historical standards and most international comparisons today. The United States, by comparison, had interest burdens on its debt ranging from about 2.4 percent to about 3.1 percent of G.D.P. throughout the 1990s, and during that time it enjoyed the longest economic expansion in its history.
France doesn't have to worry about inflation either. Inflation has been at 1.1 percent over the past year, which is well below target, and the government can borrow at a real (inflation-adjusted) interest rate of about zero.
France's main economic problem today is the same as that of the eurozone: virtually no growth in G.D.P. per capita since the world financial crisis of 2008. And the main culprits of that are the misguided policies of the economic orthodoxy in Europe.
In the view of many economists at the International Monetary Fund and, say, Emmanuel Macron, a former economy minister of France and now a presidential candidate, the fundamental cause of unemployment in France is a rigid labor market -- not, as Mr. Mï¿½lenchon and others argue, inadequate demand in the economy. So their proposed fix is to lower labor costs by reducing the bargaining power of unions, making it easier for employers to dismiss workers and raising eligibility requirements for social or unemployment benefits.
Reforms of this kind have been passed over the last few years, including the so-called "loi Macron," which relaxed rules for letting employees go. More have been recommended by the I.M.F. and European Union authorities.
But -- to take just one example -- cuts to France's pension system in 2010 were as unnecessary as they were unpopular. The year before, projections by the European Commission showed that spending on public pensions in France would increase by just 1 percent of G.D.P. over the next 60 years. Given that France's G.D.P. was projected to more than double over that period, that increase would have been eminently affordable.
So why not put some money into public investment that will provide positive real returns while creating new jobs?
Yes, high unemployment has been a fixture of the French economy for several decades now. But a major fiscal stimulus could spur overall demand in the economy, and that would encourage employers to hire workers.
The French can also afford their cherished welfare state because labor productivity in France is high -- just above that in Germany. A better output per hour of labor allows for decent wages and, with sufficient taxes on both labor and capital income, for social expenditures that provide some measure of economic security.
There are, however, constraints from the European Union. France has no problem with its current account balance at the moment, but were it to try to jump-start its economy while growth in the eurozone remained sluggish, it could eventually run an unsustainable deficit. Under the Maastricht Treaty, France is supposed to keep its budget deficit under 3 percent of G.D.P. That requirement, along with France's commitment to the European Union program for deficit reduction, would appear to preclude spending increases such as the ones that Mr. Mï¿½lenchon proposes.
But Europe cannot endure another decade of mass unemployment, which denies a future to so many young people and fuels the xenophobic far right. This is the reason Mr. Mï¿½lenchon has called for renegotiating European Union treaties. Some argue that position is too radical. Yet it is those who champion strict adherence to the European authorities' failed economic policies who stoke anti-European sentiment and endanger the future of European integration. France has enough clout within the eurozone to help steer it in a better direction.

Steel Is Pouring Out of China, And It Won't Be Easy to Stop

Full text: HANGZHOU, China -- China's vast steel industry is a major target of President Trump. But this hulking shell of a mill here shows why China is likely to keep pumping out more and more steel, inflaming trade tensions between the two countries. The Hangzhou steel mill, a vast labyrinth of blast furnaces, warehouses, chimneys and worker dormitories covering hundreds of acres, was one of Mao Zedong's favorite projects. Built in just 13 months in the late 1950s, it once employed 25,000 workers.
Pollution and the march of progress made the mill a liability. But closing a mill eliminates well-paying jobs -- a central reason China keeps factories churning out steel the world doesn't need.
When authorities do manage to shutter a plant, it is a costly ordeal, as the story of Hangzhou shows. With the help of a $34 million grant from government officials, the Hangzhou plant owner, Hangzhou Iron and Steel Group, offered the 12,000 remaining workers lavish severance benefits and pensions.
"I don't have to wake up early," said Tang Guomin, 49, who had labored at the blast furnaces since he was 18 years old. He received nearly six years' pay from the company as severance and when he turns 50 in a few months, he will be able to collect an inflation-adjusted pension from the government equal to 90 percent of his previous pay for the rest of his life.
"I sleep till I wake and don't have much to worry about," he said, while doing his family's morning vegetable shopping at a street market. "I miss the factory, but that time won't be back again."
Invoking an obscure trade law, President Trump signed an executive order on Thursday for a 270-day review to determine whether steel imports were harming national security. If the Commerce Department does find harm, Mr. Trump will have up to 90 days to decide whether to impose broad import restrictions.
China is an obvious target of the order, though the impact could ripple worldwide. While only about 2 percent of American steel imports come directly from China, global steel makers and industry experts blame China for shipping its surplus steel to other countries, which drives down prices and prompts those countries to further process the steel into high-value products for export to the United States. The Trump administration, which has made it clear that it will take a more aggressive stance on steel, has suggested it could bring trade actions against those countries as well.
China denies that it sells excess steel to other markets below the cost of making it, a move called dumping. But China does concede that it has too many steel factories making too much steel.
The trick is trimming that excess capacity, which is proving to be neither easy nor cheap. Steel making represents a reliable source of high-wage jobs in a country where economic growth has slowed compared with previous years. Steel also remains a key material for China's manufacturing sector, the world's largest.
"Steel is the food for China's industry," said Wang Guoqing, the research director at the Lange Steel Information Research Center, a Chinese industry group in Beijing. "It is in a key position for China's development and infrastructure."
The steel industry in the United States employs about 140,000 people, or less than one-tenth of 1 percent of the American work force. China's steel makers, by contrast, employed 4.7 million workers in 2014, the last official figure released, or 0.6 percent of China's labor force then. Nearly 60 years after Mao's drive to make China a steel giant contributed to a famine that killed millions of people, the country now makes as much steel as the rest of the world put together.
Today, China's steel sector represents the sort of bloated, wasteful industry that people both inside and outside the country say is holding back economic development. China in early 2016 committed to closing steel mills representing 100 million to 150 million tons of capacity over five years, or roughly a tenth of its capacity then. China closed 65 million tons of capacity last year and plans to close another 50 million tons this year, according to a speech in early March by Premier Li Keqiang.
Yet production remains stubbornly high, and new mills have continued to open. China's steel mills produced a record quantity of steel last month. China hasn't released more recent data on total steel capacity.
For now, China's steel exports are shrinking, though it isn't clear how long that will continue. China's appetite for steel has improved in recent months as government lending and spending and a revival in its property industry lift the economy and encourage consumption. But the government has said it wants to rein in lending, concerned that the economy may be too reliant on ever-rising debt.
Mr. Trump's advisers are using steel as part of a broader push against China's excess factories. They are singling out steel while blaming Chinese industrial policies for overcapacity in other sectors, like aluminum and solar panels.
"To me the objective is to make it uneconomic, to make it expensive, to do something that has inefficiency in the market," said Robert Lighthizer, Mr. Trump's nominee to become United States trade representative, at his Senate confirmation hearing.
China calls that effort shortsighted, saying it has made itself an indispensable provider of high-quality steel to the world at a time when many American steel mills are aging. Advocates of a more confrontational American trade policy fail to understand this, said Li Xinchuang, the dean of the China Metallurgical Industry Planning and Research Institute, a government agency.
"I have explained this time and time again, but they won't listen," he said. "It's like playing the lute to a cow."
The Hangzhou steel plant, and the city that it is named after, represent China's effort to shift its economy away from industries like steel. The city of at least 4 million urban residents is the hometown of Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant, and also contains the headquarters of Geely, the Chinese automaker that bought Volvo from Ford in 2010.
The former factory looks a little like a postapocalyptic scene on a Hollywood movie set: cavernous warehouses moldered on a damp spring day, windowless and doorless. Conveyor belts and other steel equipment that might have scrap metal value had already been removed, leaving barren concrete tubes and walls. A long row of black hopper cars rusted on a railroad siding.
Migrant construction laborers camped in the evening in a dilapidated, three-story concrete building, resting after a long day of tearing apart old buildings as the next step in clearing the site. Tall grass, leafy bushes and even small trees had begun growing vigorously in open areas of the factory, sometimes pushing their way up through cracks in concrete plazas.
"It looks beautiful," said Le Rong, a 42-year-old migrant worker involved in dismantling the complex. "I even told my wife and kids about it."
A Hangzhou Iron and Steel spokesman declined to discuss what the company would do with the site, saying it had not yet been decided but that the company would find an "innovative" use for the land. Former steel mill sites in other prosperous Chinese cities like Hangzhou have often been redeveloped as real estate projects.
Some of China's steel plants are outdated and many of them are polluting. Revamping them isn't cheap. In addition to the $34 million it received to close the Hangzhou plant, Hangzhou Iron and Steel in 2015 received nearly $106 million in subsidies and cheap government loans to help cover overall costs of upgrading its plants.
For many locals, closing the mill has meant cleaner air -- the reason officials said the mill was shut down.
State-run media said shortly before the Hangzhou mill closed that the aging site had been releasing 7,000 tons a year of sulfur dioxide, an important cause of acid rain, and 3,000 tons a year of soot.
Xu Yuemei, another retired steelworker, said that when the factory was still operating, garments that she hung on a clothesline turned black or yellow before they dried. Mr. Tang remembers a pervasive haze.
"There was dust in the air; I couldn't see guys 100 meters away from me," he recalled. "I could smell choking ammonia gas in the air until the factory shut down."
"After it shut down," he said, "everything is gone, including the pollution."

Full text: LOS ANGELES -- A five-studio tug of war has broken out over James Bond. For more than a decade, starting with "Casino Royale" in 2006, the superspy series has been based at Sony Pictures Entertainment. It has been a period of stability and prosperity for 007, as global ticket sales reached new heights. The four Bond films that Sony has released collected $3.5 billion at the worldwide box office, after adjusting for inflation.
But Sony's contract to market and distribute the films expired in 2015 with "Spectre." So the two companies that control the franchise but do not distribute their own films -- Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and the family-run Eon Productions -- have started attending dog and pony shows put on by studios that want the rights, according to five people briefed on the sessions, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations.
On Tuesday, for instance, leaders at Sony spent an hour making their case. Kazuo Hirai, the chief executive, helped give the pitch, which emphasized the studio's deep knowledge of Bond and its ideas for expanding the franchise's reach. In true Hollywood fashion, Sony gave its presentation inside a sound stage on a recreated set from "Dr. No," which was released in the United States in 1963 by United Artists and laid the foundation for the entire series.
Also vying for the Bond deal -- even though it pays surprisingly little -- are Warner Bros., Universal Pictures, 20th Century Fox and Annapurna, an ambitious upstart financed and led by the Oracle heiress Megan Ellison. (Not competing for the business are Paramount, which has been struggling and recently hired a new chairman, and Walt Disney Studios, which has been on a box office hot streak by focusing on its own family film labels.)
MGM and Eon, which stands for Everything or Nothing, are only offering a one-film contract. The expired Sony deal was for four movies. MGM, which is owned by private equity firms, including Anchorage Capital Partners, probably wants to keep its options open as it considers a sale or public offering.
Casting for the franchise has not been discussed in the meetings, according to the people briefed on them, although producers hope Daniel Craig will play the lead for at least one more chapter. He has a gap on his docket, according to movie industry databases, that would allow for filming.
Representatives for MGM, Eon and the studios pursuing the rights either had no comment or did not return calls.
The eagerness to land Bond underscores the continuing strength of the series but also the realities of the modern movie business. As competition for leisure time increases, studios have focused more intently on global blockbusters, and those are in short supply. In some ways, the Bond series was the first to go after a worldwide audience.
Yet the deal that studios are hotly chasing is not very profitable.
Under its previous agreement, Sony paid 50 percent of the production costs for "Spectre" -- which totaled some $250 million after accounting for government incentives -- but received only 25 percent of certain profits, once costs were recouped. Sony also shouldered tens of millions of dollars in marketing and had to give MGM a piece of the profit from non-Bond films Sony had in its own pipeline, including "22 Jump Street."
In a 2014 email stolen by hackers and widely published online, Andrew Gumpert, who then oversaw business affairs for Sony, figured that the studio would realize about $38 million in profit if "Spectre" performed as "Skyfall" did. And "Spectre" did not, taking in $881 million, about 20 percent less than "Skyfall," which was released in 2012.
Why, then, do studios want to distribute Bond so badly? Bragging rights, mostly. Having a Bond movie on the schedule guarantees at least one hit in a business where there is almost no sure thing.
Bond is gargantuan: The 25 movies have taken in nearly $6 billion at the North American box office, after adjusting for inflation, according to Box Office Mojo. The series has generated billions more in overseas ticket sales, home entertainment revenue, television reruns, marketing partnerships (Omega watches, Aston Martin cars, Gillette razors) and video games.
For at least one suitor, Annapurna, landing Bond would be transformative. Ms. Ellison started by focusing on prestige films like "Her" and "American Hustle." But she has been diversifying toward more commercial movies like the animated hit "Sausage Party" and recently hired a senior 20th Century Fox executive to serve as president of her company. Last month, Annapurna signed an unrelated distribution deal with MGM.
The person Ms. Ellison and the other bidders need to impress the most is Barbara Broccoli, who runs Eon Productions. Moviemaking is a collaborative process, but Ms. Broccoli and her older half brother, Michael G. Wilson, have final say over every line of dialogue, casting decision, stunt sequence, marketing tie-in, TV ad, poster and billboard.

Full text: To the Editor: Re "Tech Helps Airlines, but Fails Passengers," by Farhad Manjoo (State of the Art column, April 13):
As a long-suffering member of the cattle class, I'm the last person to be defending the sorry state of customer service in the United States' airline industry. If, however, Henry H. Harteveldt, head of a travel industry research firm, is correct in stating that consumers seek above all else to save money ("Consumers have shown that they're willing to put up with an awful lot, including lack of legroom, lack of amenities, mediocre or worse customer service, dirty airplanes and more to save money"), then we're getting exactly what we asked for.
The Bureau of Transportation Statistics reports that average airfares at the end of 2016 were 23.9 percent lower, adjusted for inflation, than they were in 1995. More of us are traveling and paying less for the "pleasure."
JAMES MARTIN, WASHINGTON
To the Editor:
Contrary to your article, new technology continues to improve the experience for passengers in a number of ways. For example, the development of e-tickets and bar-coded boarding passes allows passengers to check in at home at their convenience, or at an airport kiosk. This has eliminated the need to wait in long lines at check-in counters. Once onboard, travelers in many countries can avail themselves of Wi-Fi for work or leisure.
Airlines have also introduced new technology and systems to improve bag tracking, which has helped reduce the number of mishandled bags by 50 percent since 2007. Introduction of radio frequency identification tags and other devices will cut this even further.
The industry has also developed a modern data transmission standard for communications between airlines and travel agents. This will provide greater transparency and comparison opportunities for consumers when shopping via a travel agent or search engine by providing access to all an airline's offerings, not just the base fare and schedule.
PERRY FLINT, WASHINGTON

The Muni Market Turns Toward Washington

Full text: With $3.8 trillion in bonds from more than 50,000 issuers, the municipal market is remarkably large and diverse. But right now, the vast muni universe is focused on one city, Washington. Numerous proposals of the Trump administration and the Republican-controlled Congress could rattle the market if enacted.
President Trump's call for $1 trillion in infrastructure spending could swell the nation's municipal bond supply, for example, while the possibility of lower corporate tax rates could reduce the appetites of banks and insurers, which now own about 30 percent of muni bonds.
What's more, if personal income tax rates went down (another possibility in Washington these days), demand for muni bonds could drop because the tax-sheltering features of the bonds could be less enticing. Even more troubling for the market, the tax exemption of interest income -- the very foundation of municipal bonds -- is always part of discussions about changing the tax code.
The muni bond market initially reacted negatively to these possibilities. The iShares National Muni Bond ETF fell 4.2 percent from the presidential election until Dec. 2. That was a rough stretch for all kinds of bonds, as interest rates climbed and the Federal Reserve indicated it was on the cusp of more aggressive rate increases, though the muni slide was more pronounced. The iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF, which tracks the high-grade taxable market, lost only 2.75 percent in the same period.
But the market may have overreacted, said John V. Miller, co-head of fixed income at Nuveen Asset Management. "There is a perception that every one of the policies being discussed will be passed and passed in short order and all will be deeply harmful to municipal bond investors," he said. The reality is different. "I expect there will be a delay, and even if some of the proposals get through, they aren't all unequivocally negative," Mr. Miller said.
Indeed, after the initial shock wore off, the Bloomberg Barclays Municipal Bond index gained 3.2 percent from its December low through the end of the first quarter, while an index of taxable bonds rose 1.3 percent. "It's not 100 percent clear it is going to be a rocky year," said Cormac Cullen, co-manager of Fidelity Municipal Income Fund.
Professional municipal bond investors are generally sanguine that while policy changes may cause some near-term volatility, they are not an existential threat. Depending on how negotiations in Washington play out, there could even be some good news for munis.
For example, the precarious condition of the compromised Oroville Dam during California's heavy rainfall this winter once again put the spotlight on the need for major infrastructure investments. The early estimates to repair the damaged spillway for the tallest dam in the United States are as high as $200 million. While Oroville is an extreme case, there is no shortage of other dams, bridges, roads and transit systems across the country in need of serious care.
The $1 trillion for infrastructure the president proposed may not roil muni bonds too greatly because the outlay would probably be spread out over a decade, making it more digestible for the $3.8 trillion market. Moreover, all or a portion of the money may be earmarked for funding private-public partnerships, which could resemble something along the lines of the taxable Build America Bonds that were issued as part of the 2009 stimulus. In that case, the supply of traditional tax-exempt munis would not swell. "You can't presume all the spending would be for projects financed with tax-exempt money," Mr. Miller said.
Nor is a reduction in the corporate tax rate all bad news. Peter Hayes, head of the municipal bond group at BlackRock, believes that a new rate would not be low enough to cause insurers and banks to high-tail it out of municipal bonds. "What we could see is that they let their municipal portfolios mature and, over time, shift money into other assets," he said. Yet, Mr. Hayes said, "There's also the possibility that the ability of corporations to deduct corporate bond interest goes away." That would lead to less issuance of corporate bonds -- and that could increase demand for muni bonds.
A reduction in personal income tax rates is also not expected to be a seismic event. One possibility is that the top rate would fall from 39.6 percent to 33 percent. That's a lot less than the fall from 50 percent to 28 percent under the Reagan tax cuts, which the municipal market survived. Moreover, it is not as if any state with a high income tax rate is talking about cuts. And right now, a 10-year high-grade municipal bond has the same 2.5 percent yield as a taxable 10-year Treasury note. That works out to a 3.73 percent taxable equivalent yield for someone in a 33-percent federal income tax bracket
As for eliminating the exemption for interest income, changing it would affect thousands of municipalities that rely on muni bonds to finance their public works. For that reason alone, it is widely seen as unlikely to happen.
What has a much higher probability of affecting muni bonds this year is rising interest rates, though even here, the damage may not be great. While a sharp rate spike would cause bond prices to suffer bigger losses, Christopher Ryon, municipal bond manager at Thornburg Investment Management, noted that "we are not in a situation where rates are going to take off." (Bond prices and bond yields move in opposite directions. Total return is the sum of the yield and the price change.) With expectations for rates that are higher but not too high, "you will be getting more income, which is why you own municipals," Mr. Ryon said.
And that rate rise is making municipal bonds a better value. "Before the election, you were not getting paid to take risk," Mr. Ryon said, citing the fact that the inflation-adjusted yield for a 10-year municipal bond was below zero. Today it is back at 0.65 percent. That is still below the longer-term norm of two percentage points, but it is moving in the right direction.
Nonetheless, rising rates merit some attention. Gary Schatsky, a financial adviser based in New York City, is sticking with short-term municipal bonds maturing in three years or less. The yields are small (around 1 percent before factoring in the tax break), but you aren't exposed to much price movement as rates rise, or if policy changes materialize.
Another way to eke out more yield is to look for portfolios that emphasize bonds rated A (often called single-A) over AA and AAA bonds. A single-A bond is still considered high quality, just a little less than AA and AAA. The 3 percent yield for a 10-year A-rated bond is about a half a percentage point more than the yield for AAA bonds.
Funds and ETFs that track a municipal index hold less than 20 percent in single-A bonds. Actively managed high-quality funds including Fidelity Municipal Income and T. Rowe Price Summit Municipal Income now invest more than 30 percent in single-A issues.
"Single-A bonds offer good risk-reward," said Kevin Ramundo, co-manager of Fidelity Municipal Income. That's a balancing act that will be ever more valuable this year as policy makers bear down.

Hitting a Speed Bump

Full text: The Trump bump in the stock market ran into trouble when the Republican effort to "repeal and replace Obamacare" foundered in Congress and the Federal Reserve increased interest rates, raising doubts that developments in Washington would treat the markets as kindly for the rest of the year as they appear to have done right after Election Day. Stocks had recorded a succession of highs in the hope that President Trump's proposals for significant infrastructure spending, reduced regulation and an overhaul of the tax code would be enacted and be good for business.
But then, the market became choppier.
"The realization is setting in that even with a Republican White House and congressional majority, it doesn't ensure a smooth enactment of legislation," said Rebecca H. Patterson, chief investment officer of Bessemer Trust, a firm that advises wealthy families. Referring to the decline in March that accelerated after the health care bill showed signs of stalling, she added: "How much hope was priced in? Well, that much was priced in."
Maybe more than that, according to Komal Sri-Kumar, president of Sri-Kumar Global Strategies.
"We need all of the Trump stimulus to take place, and we need a tax cut," he said, to justify stocks' trading as high as they are. "I don't think either is going to take place in a hurry."
If at all. Robert Arnott, co-manager of the Pimco All Asset Fund, said that while the prospect exists for Mr. Trump to be "a transformational president" who can succeed at "disentangling the regulatory state, cutting a lot of red tape, making it easier for free enterprise to be free, a lot of that is likely to turn out to be wishful thinking."
It was wishful enough to take the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index up more than 12 percent between Election Day and the beginning of March. For the first quarter, the benchmark index rose 5.5 percent, closing at 2,362.72.
When it comes to the outlook for monetary policy, the thinking is mixed. Ms. Patterson said the Fed's move last month "was perceived as an incredibly dovish hike, if that's not too much of an oxymoron." That's because Janet L. Yellen, the Fed chairwoman, declined to discuss plans for selling trillions of dollars of Treasury instruments and other securities added to the Fed's balance sheet after the global financial crisis through its quantitative easing program.
Mr. Sri-Kumar envisions a more accommodative Fed than is widely expected. The economy will remain too anemic for more than one rate increase a year for the time being, he predicted.
Jeffrey Gundlach, chief executive of DoubleLine Capital, counters that central bankers would have to be more assertive because, with the unemployment rate below 5 percent and inflation above 2 percent, "they have met their policy objectives."
"We've moved into a base case where it's not so much that if the data improves, the Fed will consider raising rates," Mr. Gundlach said. "Now if the data stays where it is, the Fed will raise rates once a quarter. If you look under the hood" at Ms. Yellen's commentary last month, "it wasn't that dovish."
Tighter monetary policy is ultimately good for long-term government bonds, all else being equal, he said, because it depresses economic growth and inflation. As he put it, "the long-bond market wants the Fed to destroy the economy."
But the economy is still doing well enough to keep the 10-year Treasury yield from falling much further, Mr. Gundlach predicted. He foresees it falling to 2.25 percent from 2.4 percent on March 31, before heading close to 3 percent later in the year. He would avoid buying longer-term government debt, therefore, and high-grade corporate bonds, which he said had "huge interest-rate risk."
As for stocks, they would face pressure from a further rise in bond yields, he warned.
"The argument for stocks has for quite some time been that they're better than bonds," Mr. Gundlach said. "As interest rates move higher, you start to get real competition" for investors' money. "It's going to be a tough environment in the middle of this year with bond yields rising."
It was a sufficiently favorable environment in the first quarter to send the average domestic stock mutual fund up 4.9 percent, according to Morningstar. Portfolios that focus on technology and health care did especially well, while specialists in industrials and financial services lagged.
The average taxable bond fund gained a modest 1.6 percent.
Tobias Levkovich, chief United States equity strategist at Citi Research, contends that the economy is humming along better than many on Wall Street believe and that it makes more sense to attribute the rally in stocks to stronger growth than to a Trump bump.
"The economy and earnings data were getting better before the elections," Mr. Levkovich said, with measures like new business orders and capital spending already on the rise. "The Fed was watching all this data, as well," he added, and that's why it raised rates in March.
His benign economic view leads him to be wary of bonds; he expects a 10-year Treasury yield of 2.6 percent at year's end, and little opportunity for gains. He encourages investing in stock sectors that are especially sensitive to growth, like energy -- which he said had been underperforming technology almost to the extent that it did during the 2000 tech bubble -- and industrials. He also likes narrower segments like biotechnology and producers of entertainment and media content.
Ms. Patterson is less hopeful about the economy and stocks. While she finds that economic and earnings growth "continue to look pretty good," she thinks a downward turn in the cycle is approaching.
"We've been neutral on stocks since late spring, and we'll probably stay neutral until it's time to go underweight," she said, adding a caveat: "You don't want to be too nervous too early."
Although she is less hopeful on the economy than Mr. Levkovich, Ms. Patterson likewise favors energy stocks. She also recommends health care and would avoid materials stocks, another economically sensitive sector.
"We went into the year thinking equities were already highly valued and we're in the latter stages of the economic cycle," she said. "We're telling our clients that over the next few years we'll have positive equity returns, but that they have to manage their expectations."
With his low expectations for the economy, Mr. Sri-Kumar advises a liberal allocation to Treasury and high-grade corporate bonds, and he would limit exposure to the stock market to defensive sectors like utilities and consumer staples.
Investors have seldom felt the need to go into a defensive crouch during the eight-year bull run in stocks. The market appears pricey, Mr. Arnott said, based on the CAPE Shiller ratio, which compares share prices to the last 10 years of inflation-adjusted earnings to get a valuation reading that adjusts for the shifts of the economic cycle.
"Now, we sit with a Shiller P.E. that briefly touched 29," he said. "That's pretty expensive," more so than at any time in the last century, he said, other than just before the 1929 crash and in the run-up to the popping of the tech bubble in 2000.
"That's heady company to be keeping," he said. "It's not a slam-dunk formula for a market crash, but it suggests very high odds for long-term anemic returns."
Mr. Arnott finds the return prospects much better abroad, with stocks trading at 13 times earnings in Europe and 12 times in emerging markets. As for bonds, local-currency debt in emerging markets yields about 6.5 percent on average, compared with 1.5 percent for a basket of long-term government issues from the United States, Germany, Japan, Britain and France.
Emerging markets "are priced for deep disappointment," he said. "Any upside surprise is not priced in."
Funds that invest in emerging stock markets did not disappoint in the first quarter. The average one rose 11.9 percent, helping the average international stock fund to return 7.9 percent.
Mr. Gundlach prefers foreign markets for similar reasons. He favors France, where returns have lagged those in other European countries, like Germany and Britain, over the last year. A populist presidential candidate, Marine Le Pen, has continued to poll well ahead of French elections that will begin next Sunday, although she is not expected to win.
Among emerging markets, he considers India an excellent investment over the very long term. He foresees its economy developing much as China's has over the last few decades.
"When foreign markets outperform the U.S., you see tremendous enthusiasm for U.S. investors to diversify, but they're buying what has already gone up," Mr. Gundlach said. "If diversification is prudent, why not do it when you've already made big profits on U.S. investments?"

Full text: Venezuela has put off a reckoning on its tens of billions of dollars in debt, but its ability to avoid a disastrous default will probably require much higher oil prices than appear likely in the next year or two, financial experts say. With its oil production and international reserves falling at an accelerating rate, the government is juggling as fast as it can to pay for imported food and medicines while meeting its short-term bond payments. Even as the country has slashed imports, its reserves have declined by half over the last two years, to $10.4 billion. Most of that sum is in gold and is pledged as security for many of the government's creditors, which include international institutional investors and everyday Venezuelans.
"The probability of default is rising," said Stuart Culverhouse, head of sovereign and credit research at Exotix Partners, a London-based investment bank that trades Venezuelan bonds on behalf of clients. "So far their willingness to pay has been pretty firm, surprisingly so given the political situation. But you have to ask how long that can continue when they are probably spending more on debt service than imports."
Complicating the picture is the escalating political turmoil challenging President Nicolás Maduro, who needs to shore up his popularity if he is to retain power in the elections scheduled for next year. Consumers have to endure long lines for food and other necessities, and hunger is spreading. With Venezuela's refineries in disrepair, even gasoline is in short supply. A monthly inflation rate of 20 percent is shrinking the value of paychecks.
International financial experts say that the global oil price will have to rise about $15 a barrel -- to $70 -- to substantially improve the financial situation for the government and Petróleos de Venezuela, its state-owned oil company, better known as PDVSA. With United States oil production rising, and the commitment of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to extend production cuts in question, few energy experts expect prices of more than $65 a barrel over the next year unless political violence causes a serious oil disruption in the Middle East.
The external bond debt of the government and PDVSA amounts to roughly $60 billion, most of which has been incurred since President Hugo Chávez took power nearly two decades ago and installed a socialist-inspired government. But that tells only a piece of the story, since the country has additional liabilities with international lending institutions. China appears to have quietly stopped making new project loans guaranteed by oil shipments last year.
All told, the Venezuelan government and the state oil company owe $8.5 billion in payments this year, and at least an additional $7.9 billion in 2018 -- amounts that economists say will further erode international reserves that form the last defense against default.
Venezuela said it would make the nearly $3 billion in payments due on Wednesday. Those are mostly related to PDVSA's April 5.25 percent note, which requires a combined interest and principal payment of $2.5 billion, and institutional investors said the PDVSA payment had been made. Normally that would be an easy stretch for an oil company with some of the largest reserves in the world.
But PDVSA is but a shadow of its old self. The company's cash is running out, its oil fields are losing pressure, critical equipment at its ports and processing plants is in disrepair, and it is unable to pay billions of dollars it owes to the international oil service companies critical to its operations.
Once one of the premier oil exporters, Venezuela now produces roughly two million barrels a day, down by more than a million barrels over the last two decades. Experts say they expect another 10 percent decline in production this year.
Since last November, Venezuela has gotten some relief; oil prices have gradually risen after OPEC cut its oil production by more than a million barrels a day, to the lowest levels in a year. Venezuela has been one of the leading members of the cartel pushing for the production cuts. Its recent output, as estimated by the Middle East Petroleum and Economic Publications, is about 60,000 barrels a day above the production target Venezuela agreed to last year. Such figures suggest that the country may be cheating a bit on its commitments.
"They still have rabbits in their hat," said Walter Molano, head of research and chief economist at BCP Securities, based in Greenwich, Conn. "They will do everything they can to keep on servicing their debt with the hope that oil production turns around and oil prices go up."
PDVSA has turned to Citgo, its American-based refinery and gas station subsidiary, for relief. In recent years Citgo has borrowed several billion dollars, using its three refineries and pipeline assets as collateral, with the money going to Caracas. PDVSA pledged about half of Citgo's equity to bondholders, and the rest to secure a loan from Rosneft, the Russian oil giant.
Late last year, Venezuelan oil officials began to consider transferring control of a Venezuelan oil field around San Felix to Citgo to increase Citgo's valuation and raise its creditworthiness for more borrowing. But at the moment, financial analysts say, Citgo is not in a position to borrow much more for its parent company.
"Citgo has been used as a cash cow," said Diego Ferro, co-chief investment officer at Greylock Capital Management, a New York-based hedge fund that invests in distressed, high-yield bonds, including Venezuela's. "They are trying to get any cash that they can. And over the next year and a half until elections, they will go to more absurd ways of monetizing things."
Still, Venezuelan bonds have been a lucrative trade for some investors. When oil prices dipped below $30 a barrel in February 2016, the April 2017 PDVSA bonds sold at 36 cents to the dollar. Those who held the bonds to maturity this week will gain a return of nearly 114 percent on principal, according to Nomura, which trades Venezuelan bonds for clients.
"While they are able to muddle through, your exposure to Venezuela is going to outperform almost everything else in the emerging-market bond universe," said Siobhan Morden, Nomura's head of Latin America fixed-income strategy. "However, you have to be very careful to have an exit strategy. You're looking at an advanced stage of cash-flow stress."

Don't Politicize the Federal Reserve

Full text: I was in the room when President Bill Clinton decided to reappoint Alan Greenspan, a lifelong Republican originally appointed by Ronald Reagan, as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. A political adviser urged Mr. Clinton to choose an administration ally, but that was never seriously considered. The president's choice was not determined by party, or politics or ideology. That's how it has been for decades: Federal Reserve chairmen and governors have been selected based on their ability to serve the country. President Barack Obama reappointed George W. Bush's nominee, Ben Bernanke, as chairman. President Reagan reappointed Jimmy Carter's nominee, Paul Volcker.
The Federal Reserve System was created by statute in 1913, but the independence of its monetary policy from congressional or presidential influence is not codified by law -- and it wasn't always inviolable. In recent years, so-called reforms have been proposed to subject Fed monetary policy to congressional review, but its independence has so far been preserved.
For good reason: An independent Federal Reserve led by governors who are committed to pursuing its dual mandate of price stability and full employment, as well as effective regulation -- and who make decisions based on facts and analysis -- is critically important to our economy, the well-being of the people and the market credibility of Fed policy making.
But that independence is about to be severely tested. Daniel K. Tarullo stepped down from the Federal Reserve Board last week, adding to the board's two existing vacancies. Instead of remaining as governors, Chairwoman Janet Yellen and Stanley Fischer, the vice chairman, could step down when their terms expire next year. President Trump has already said that he will not reappoint Ms. Yellen as chairwoman because she's not a Republican.
Mr. Trump could therefore fill as many as five of the board's seven seats within the next year. I fear that he may appoint governors who lack a commitment to the Fed's dual mandate and will instead seek to please the White House.
There could also be an effort to scapegoat the Fed if (or rather, when) the administration's unrealistic economic growth estimates fail to materialize. The recent rejection of Congressional Budget Office health care estimates is a troubling sign. The administration could use rigged economic projections to attack the Fed over its decisions, rather than respecting its integrity and independence.
The Fed is not always right -- no one can be on these matters. But it is staffed by, and the board consists of, immensely capable professionals who work with absolute intellectual integrity. That's why the Fed's work is highly and widely respected in the United States and around the world. This credibility keeps market interest rates lower and liquidity greater. That, too, could change.
Efforts to denigrate the integrity of the Fed's work, and to inject groundless opinion, politics and ideology, must be rejected by the board -- and that means governors and other members of the Federal Open Market Committee must be willing to withstand aggressive attacks.
In the short run, these attacks could occur if the Fed raises rates when the administration would prefer to avoid impediments to its wishful thinking on growth or to the continued run-up of the stock market. The Fed is expected to raise rates two or three times during the coming year, based on its widely shared view that unemployment is as low as it can be without triggering inflation. There is undoubtedly still some room to bring those who have dropped out of the labor market back in, but mainstream labor economists say not much, especially given the skills gap.
The path to greater growth over time is productivity-enhancing policy. While a small fiscal stimulus might increase real growth and wages, a highly expansive fiscal policy is very unlikely to meaningfully increase real growth, and the rest of the effect is likely to be inflationary, absent countervailing Federal Reserve action. Waiting until inflation gains momentum could force the Fed to take more dramatic action that could induce recession. With the administration's unwillingness to appreciate these realities, Fed rate hikes could provoke political backlash.
During my years as secretary of the Treasury, I had a weekly breakfast with Mr. Greenspan and Larry Summers, the deputy secretary. We discussed everything under the sun, from the outlook for the United States economy to the latest political gossip. But never once did Mr. Summers or I, even in the privacy of those meetings, raise monetary policy, nor did anyone in the Clinton administration comment on monetary policy.
As a result, the Fed chairman knew that the White House would not try to advance an agenda on that policy. And this trust enabled the Federal Reserve and the Treasury to engage fully with each other on other matters, such as the Mexican and Asian financial crises. Sooner or later, there will be other financial crises -- in the United States and abroad -- and maintaining a framework of trust for the Treasury and the Fed to work together is critical.
The administration's relationship to the Fed, and its appointment of governors, must be based not on politics but on the same question every president ought to ask: Who and what will best serve our country?

Full text: Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, said Monday that the Fed was shifting its focus from stimulating the economy to keeping growth on an even keel. She said the economy was "pretty healthy," thanks in part to the Fed's long-running stimulus campaign, which the central bank is moving to end.
"Looking forward, I think the economy is going to continue to grow at a moderate pace," Ms. Yellen said during an event at the University of Michigan. "Our job is going to be to try to set monetary policy to sustain what we have achieved."
The Fed raised its benchmark interest rate in March for the third time since the financial crisis, and said it planned two more rate increases this year. The Fed also said it planned to begin reducing its large holdings of securities by the end of the year. Ms. Yellen did not offer any additional details during her appearance on Monday.
Ms. Yellen, interviewed onstage by Susan M. Collins, the dean of the Ford School of Public Policy at the university, used the opportunity to make a strong case for the financial regulations enacted by Congress in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act to address the problems revealed by the 2008 financial crisis.
President Trump and congressional Republicans have said they want to eliminate or overhaul many of those measures, which they regard as ineffective in preventing future financial crises and as impediments to economic growth.
Ms. Yellen pushed back on both counts. She cited changes that she said had increased the strength of the financial system, including requiring banks to raise more money from investors and subjecting large banks to annual stress tests.
"We have accomplished a lot, and we have a much safer system," she said.
She also directly addressed the argument that the regulatory pendulum has swung too far and that government rules are preventing healthy financial activity. "I don't think if you look at objective data on lending, that it's possible to make the case that regulation has simply stifled lending," Ms. Yellen said. "Lending is growing in a very healthy way as the economy has recovered."
She said banks were actually in a better position to lend, although she acknowledged that the Fed would like to reduce the burden on smaller banks.
Ms. Yellen's assessment of economic conditions remained upbeat.
She noted that the unemployment rate, which fell to 4.5 percent in March, is now below the level that most Fed officials regard as sustainable. Consumer spending is growing at a decent pace, and Ms. Yellen noted that the global economy was also looking "slightly more robust and healthier." Though inflation remains a bit weaker than the 2 percent annual pace the Fed regards as healthy, she said it would be appropriate for the Fed to keep raising interest rates.
She said, however, that the economy still faced problems that were beyond the power of monetary policy. While job growth has been strong, economic growth remains relatively slow, around 2 percent a year in recent years. If more people are working, making more things or doing more things in less time, the economy should be growing faster.
"The fact that you can create that many jobs in the context of growth that is so low points to a significant problem," Ms. Yellen said. "And the problem is that productivity growth is very low."
Productivity measures the average person's economic contribution. There are only two possible causes of economic growth: more people or increased productivity, which is to say, the same number of people making more stuff. We have slow population growth and slow productivity growth, so we have slow economic growth.
Economists regard the slow pace of productivity growth as something of a mystery. Ms. Yellen tipped her hat to a number of the theories in circulation.
Some economists think the flow of good ideas has simply slowed. Others point to a leveling-off in educational attainment. She also pointed to recent research that suggested one factor was a decline in corporate competition: less creation of new businesses and more corporate consolidation.
Ms. Yellen said the combination of relatively fast job growth and relatively slow economic growth pointed to the underlying problem.
She also fielded some lighter questions. Asked how she dealt with pressure, Ms. Yellen described herself as an "ardent believer" in the importance of a good night's sleep. Asked for life advice, she encouraged students to find a profession that fills them with a sense of enthusiasm every day.
"For me," she said, "the core of having a satisfying career first and foremost was finding something to do that I really love."

Near-Zero Interest Rates: Get Used to Them

Full text: When the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates to close to zero during the financial crisis, it was an extraordinary move. The central bank had hit the limits of conventional monetary policy, leaving the recovery to sputter along with less help than it needed. Now, with that crisis at last behind us, the Fed has begun raising interest rates, and it may be tempting to view its brush with rock-bottom rates as a once-in-a-lifetime experiment and to assume that we are entering a more normal world.
If only that were true. A new study suggests that near-zero interest rates -- accompanied by a lackluster recovery -- may become a common occurrence.
That's troubling for many reasons. If the Fed can't cut rates as much as required to fight a slowing economy, then recessions will become more common and more painful. It suggests an urgent need to reconsider how we will counter the next bout of bad economic news, preferably before it arrives. If monetary policy won't be enough, perhaps fiscal policy will be. Certainly, this is no time for complacency.
In a nutshell, the American economy appears to have changed in a way that undermines the effectiveness of monetary policy but not fiscal policy, which may need to be wielded more actively.
All of this is the result of two broad trends. First, inflation is lower than in the past. From 1950 through 2011, it averaged around 3.5 percent. In January 2012, the Federal Reserve committed to a target of 2 percent, and actual inflation levels have been even lower.
Second, the real (inflation-adjusted) interest rate consistent with the economy operating at its full potential has fallen, a trend that the Harvard economist Lawrence H. Summers called "secular stagnation." Most estimates suggest that this "neutral real interest rate" has dropped from around 2.5 percent to 1 percent, or lower.
Put these pieces together, and a conservative guess is that in "normal times," the nominal interest rate -- the neutral real interest rate plus inflation -- has fallen from around 6 percent to 3 percent.
That creates a serious problem for the Fed. Here's why: Most recessions can be cured by lowering rates by several percentage points. When interest rates were closer to 6 percent, the Fed could lift the economy with plenty of interest-rate leeway.
But when normal interest rates are closer to 3 percent, the Fed can cut rates only a few times, because rates can only go so low -- perhaps as low as zero, maybe a tad lower. This means that in even a typical downturn, the Fed may be unable to cut rates as much as it would like.
Even worse, this limit is a far bigger problem when an economic downturn follows closely on the heels of a previous recession. Right now, for instance, the central bank's main short-term rate, the federal funds rate, is still only three-quarters of a percent to 1 percent, because the Fed wants to continue stimulating the recovery. This leaves the central bank with very little room to respond if the economy falters. Even a minor slowdown now could require a larger rate cut than is feasible, once again leaving policy makers wishing they could do more.
This dynamic can feed on itself. The less ammunition the Fed has to blast the economy out of its malaise, the weaker and slower will be the recovery, making it more likely that the next bad shock will require the Fed to cut rates more than is feasible.
To assess these problems, two senior Federal Reserve economists, Michael T. Kiley and John M. Roberts, ran hundreds of simulations in the Fed's large-scale macroeconomic model, evaluating how the United States would perform in response to the sorts of shocks that have historically buffeted the economy.
In one set of simulations that you might call the good old days, they set the normal interest rate at 6 percent, and then let the Fed adjust rates as economic conditions evolved. In that environment, interest rates hit zero only around 2 percent of the time. This accords with the reality that the lower limit on interest rates simply was not a problem until recently.
But times have changed. When the economists set the normal interest rate at 3 percent and let the Fed adjust interest rates as conditions warranted, rates moved down to zero percent and could not move any lower roughly a third of the time. In some of these cases, the economy didn't need much extra punch, and so this slowed the recovery only a little. In others, it was a more telling constraint, and it took years for the economy to return to normal.
Their research paper, "Monetary Policy in a Low Interest Rate World," which was presented at a recent meeting of the Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, explains why this is so worrisome.
The problem is that a lower bound on interest rates creates a sharp asymmetry in how the economy works: It's relatively easy for the Fed to cool an overheating economy by raising rates. But when the economy is already cooling down, the central bank may not be able to cut rates enough to prevent a recession or to spur a strong recovery. Downturns will be deeper and more common than upswings. This means that, on average, output will be lower than it needs to be -- perhaps more than a percentage point lower -- and inflation will be lower than the Fed's 2 percent target. Joblessness will be more common, particularly during slumps.
It is crucial, therefore, that macroeconomic policy adjusts to these problems before the next downturn hits.
The Fed has already been experimenting with monetary policy, but it hasn't been enough. In the wake of the financial crisis, for example, it bought bonds in a program known as quantitative easing, cutting long-term interest rates once short-term rates were near zero. The resulting stimulus was relatively small, reducing long-term rates by only a fraction of a percentage point, and the program was politically unpopular.
The authors suggest an alternative approach in which the Fed makes up for "missing stimulus" by promising to keep rates lower, for longer periods. In their view, the Fed needs to make up for the interest rate cuts that it wishes it could have made, but couldn't. Promising this in the depths of a downturn would offer businesses reason to be optimistic, they say, boosting the recovery. The Fed would need to keep rates low, even as inflation overshot its target.
It's a promising approach, but would people really believe the Fed's promises? I know a lot of central bankers, and I fear they are incapable of sitting still while inflation rises above their stated target.
Perhaps the answer lies outside the Fed. It may be time to revive a more active role for fiscal policy -- government spending and taxation -- so that the government fills in for the missing stimulus when the Fed can't cut rates any longer. Given political realities, this may be best achieved by building in stronger automatic stabilizers, mechanisms to increase spending in bad times, without requiring Congressional action.
There's an opportunity to wed this to President Trump's desire for more infrastructure spending. Rather than building more roads today as the economy approaches full employment, we should spend more when the economy is weak and the Fed is unable to provide enough stimulus. One way that this could be done is by automatically increasing the Highway Trust Fund when the federal funds rate hits zero and perhaps ramping up spending the longer that rates are stuck there. More roads would be built when they do the most good for the economy.
This idea reverses a decades-long trend away from active fiscal policy. The general distrust of fiscal policy may well have made sense; many economists are more likely to trust the technocrats at the Fed to manage the business cycle than the election-driven politicians on Capitol Hill. But in a world of low interest rates in which the Fed is frequently hamstrung, we may not have that choice.

Full text: Economics has a foundation in hard numbers -- employment, inflation, spending -- that has largely allowed it to sidestep the competing partisan narratives that have afflicted American politics and culture. But not anymore. Since Donald J. Trump's victory in November, consumer sentiment has diverged in an unprecedented way, with Republicans convinced that a boom is at hand, and Democrats foreseeing an imminent recession.
"We've never recorded this before," said Richard Curtin, who directs the University of Michigan's monthly survey of consumer sentiment. Although the outlook has occasionally varied by political party since the survey began in 1946, "the partisan divide has never had as large an impact on consumers' economic expectations," he said.
At the same time, familiar economic data points have become Rorschach tests. That was evident after the government's monthly jobs report on Friday; Republicans' talking points centered on a 10-year low in the unemployment rate, while Democrats focused on a sharp decline in job creation.
"I find it stunning, to be honest. It's unreal," said Michael R. Strain, director of economic policy studies at the conservative American Enterprise Institute in Washington. "Things that were less politicized in the past, like how you feel about the economy, have become more politicized now."
Indeed, the night-and-day views underscore yet another front on which Americans remain polarized five months after the election, and with President Trump nearing his 100th day in office.
There are some tangible reasons for the split. Many Republican states, including the Midwestern swing states that provided Mr. Trump's margin of victory, have experienced a more sluggish recovery over the last eight years -- and are thus more invested in the change promised by Mr. Trump.
Many Democratic states have bounced back more vigorously. Hence their political and economic viewpoints were jolted by November's election result.
For example, Vermont, Colorado and Massachusetts -- all carried by the Democrats -- are thriving, with an unemployment rate below 4 percent. In Republican strongholds like Alaska, Georgia and Alabama, the rate is well above the national average of 4.5 percent.
Rank-and-file Republicans aren't the only ones who are feeling more upbeat, whether or not it's justified by the data. Sentiment among business leaders who backed Mr. Trump has also surged since the election.
David Congdon, chief executive of Old Dominion Freight Line, the trucking giant, never expected Mr. Trump to win when he voted for him in November.
"I fell out of bed when I got up in the morning on Nov. 9," he admitted. "I didn't quite know what I was voting for."
But despite misfires in Washington like the failed attempt to roll back President Barack Obama's health care policies, Mr. Congdon is definitely feeling more positive.
"Trump's got a hard road ahead of him, but I think he's off to a decent start," said Mr. Congdon, who recently joined other transportation executives for a meeting with Mr. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence.
"I'm personally optimistic about the economy for the rest of the year, and I think we will see an uptick in terms of freight deliveries," he said. "We have picked up our hiring."
Economists, too, find their outlook shifting with the political landscape. Before the election, Heather Boushey, a top adviser to Hillary Clinton during the campaign, thought "the economy was on the right track, with slow and steady growth like we've had over the past few years."
Now she is much more pessimistic, especially about the economy's long-term prospects. Although she is pleased that the Affordable Care Act survived Republican efforts to repeal it, the gridlock has led her to believe that Mr. Trump will never get a big infrastructure spending package through Congress.
"I am losing hope that we will make those much-needed investments over the next few years," said Ms. Boushey, executive director of the liberal Center for Equitable Growth.
The University of Michigan researchers have their own way of measuring the gulf between the two viewpoints and how quickly it has flipped.
Among Republicans, the Michigan consumer expectations index was at 61.1 in October, the kind of reading typically reported in the depths of a recession. Confident that Mrs. Clinton would win, Democrats registered a 95.4 reading, close to the highs reached when her husband was in office in the late 1990s and the economy was soaring.
By March, the positions were reversed, with an even more extreme split. Republicans' expectations had soared to 122.5, equivalent to levels registered in boom times. As for Democrats, they were even more pessimistic than Republicans had been in October.
As at the voting booth, the split in perceptions could have real-world consequences. If behavior tracks the recession-era sentiment among Democrats, who account for 32 percent of respondents in the survey, prophecies could quickly become self-fulfilling by affecting spending and investing decisions.
"If one-third of the population cut their consumer spending by 5 percent, you get a recession," said Alan Blinder, a Princeton economist who served in the Clinton administration and advised Al Gore and Hillary Clinton on economic policy during their Democratic presidential campaigns. "I don't think it will happen, but it's not beyond the realm of the possible."
To be sure, even if Democratic consumers pulled back, that wouldn't necessarily bring on a recession. A burst of spending by bullish Republicans, who equal 27 percent of those polled by the Michigan researchers, could counteract much of that drag. And independents, who are the largest cohort in the survey, at 41 percent, remain fairly optimistic about future growth.
It is rare for "rising optimism to coexist with increasing uncertainty," said Mr. Curtin, the Michigan expert. "The current level of optimism clearly indicates that no economywide spending retrenchment is underway, but the prevailing level of uncertainty will limit growth in discretionary spending."
Lawrence H. Summers, who served as Treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton and was Mr. Obama's chief economic adviser during his first term, said he, too, was struck by the big swing in economic sentiment.
"It is a remarkably big switch from October," he said. "If you are a Democrat, you are primed for negativity. It carries through in your view of everything else."
A prominent Democrat himself and a strong Hillary Clinton backer, Mr. Summers is nonetheless slightly more optimistic than he was late last year, because the data on housing starts and business investment intentions has been positive, not because of the new administration's policies.
Whether the optimists or pessimists prove more prescient about the economy's trajectory, Mr. Summers said, the split in perceptions will persist.
"I'd bet there will be some minor convergence," he said, "but there will still be a large divergence on what should be a matter of objective reality."

Full text: When the first employment report of the Trump presidency was released a month ago, the administration was quick to point to the strong growth in the number of jobs in the United States in February: 235,000, in that initial estimate. It was a mistake to emphasize it, and the newest numbers, released Friday, show why.
It's not just that the economy gained a mere 98,000 jobs in March, or that the Labor Department revised earlier months' gains down by a combined 38,000 (though that apparent volatility alone is an argument for why government officials should be cautious in promoting any given month's numbers).
More broadly, the United States economy has arrived at a place where job gains, one of hundreds of data points released as part of the monthly report, are not really the best indicator of how things are going.
When the economy is at risk of falling into a recession or struggling to grow out of one, the change in the jobs numbers really is the best single number to understand the state of the economy. While it has a lot of month-to-month statistical variance, it is a fairly reliable indicator -- especially if you average a few months together -- of whether the economy is growing, contracting or stagnant.
But there are no signs now that the United States is in recession or close to one. And once the economy is close to full employment, gains in jobs take on lesser importance. A few years ago, when the unemployment rate was at 7 or 8 or 10 percent, the level of job gains was driven by employers' confidence about the economic outlook.
Now, with the jobless rate at 4.5 percent, the binding constraint is the number of available workers. Over the long run, employers can add jobs only as quickly as there are people to fill them. That is determined by a mix of demographic factors like birthrates and immigration levels, along with choices people make like whether to work, retire or stay home with a child.
It's true that a more booming economy can tend to pull more people into the work force. As President Trump has often noted, there are indeed millions of people not in the labor force who might be in a more robust economy.
But we don't know how many of those can be coaxed back to the work force as the economy looks stronger, or at what pace. That being the case, it's hard to know with any certainty what, in 2017 and beyond, would constitute a good level of job growth and what would be a poor one.
Instead of focusing on job growth numbers, which are poised to decelerate anyway thanks to the economy's near-full-employment status, it would behoove the Trump administration to focus on job market metrics that shed more light at this stage of the recovery and that speak directly to the president's goal of getting more people back in the job market.
There are two particularly obvious ones.
Wage growth -- more specifically, average hourly earnings for private-sector employees -- seems poised to grow, and this would represent true progress for American workers. It rose 0.2 percent in March, a solid reading, and is now up 2.7 percent over the last year. That's pretty good given that inflation is low, but there's plenty of room for it to rise further as employers get into bidding wars for talented workers.
In fact, if wage growth were stronger, you would expect it to have the positive effect of pulling people on the bench into the labor force. People who don't see the value in working for $10 an hour might do so for $15.
Then there is the direct measure of how many Americans are working, the employment-to-population ratio. You can refine it to include only those who are between 25 and 54 to filter out students who aren't working because they are in school and retirees who are on the golf course.
That number showed a bit of progress in March as well -- it rose to 78.5 percent from 78.3 percent. But it remains below the 80.3 percent recent high in 2007, and well below the 81.9 percent record high in April 2000.
If the Trump administration sets its foremost goals as improvement in those numbers, wage gains and prime-age employment-to-population ratio, it will be focused on the issues that truly bedevil the United States economy in 2017, and have a considerably better chance of success.

Shares Soar, Then Slump Amid Investor Uncertainty

Full text: Stock indexes inched higher Thursday as shares of smaller retailers, banks and energy companies rose. As on Wednesday, the market was unable to hang on to more substantial gains from earlier in the day. Strong earnings reports from companies including L Brands, the parent of Victoria's Secret, and Bed Bath & Beyond helped retailers. Energy companies rose with the prices of oil and natural gas, and banks recovered some of the sharp losses they took a day ago.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose as much as 98 points early in the afternoon. However high-dividend stocks like phone companies and utilities skidded and technology companies also fell.
Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist for U.S. Bank Wealth Management, said investors were feeling uncertain, and that sentiment may hold true for at least a few weeks. After a weak auto sales report on Monday, he said investors were wondering how fast the economy was growing.
"We expect volatility to be higher than what we experienced in the first quarter," he said.
It was the second day in a row that stocks slumped during afternoon trading, although the slip Thursday was far less dramatic than the one the day before. That slide started after the Federal Reserve said it may stop buying new bonds later this year and said its policy makers were grappling with whether it would be safe to let inflation rise faster.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index added 4.54 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,357.49. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 14.80 points, or 0.1 percent, to 20,662.95.
The Nasdaq composite gained 14.47 points, or 0.2 percent, to 5,878.95. The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks performed far better, climbing 12.28 points, or 0.9 percent, to 1,364.43.
Investors will get an updated picture of the economy in the coming weeks, including the government's March report on employment Friday. Next week the Commerce Department will give a report on retailer sales and companies including JPMorgan Chase, Delta Air Lines and Netflix will report their earnings.
L Brands jumped $4.75, or 11 percent, to $47.85 after it reported strong March sales. Bed Bath & Beyond surpassed analysts' earnings estimates and climbed $1.28, or 3.4 percent, to $39.08.
Department stores and retailers like Kohl's, Nordstrom and Gap traded higher. Retail stocks have been hit hard for months as shoppers spend more money online and less at stores, especially ones based in malls.
Bond prices recovered from an early decline. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note stayed at 2.34 percent. Companies that pay big dividends, like phone companies and utilities, traded lower. Investors often sell those stocks when bond yields rise, as they did earlier in the day.
Crude oil added 55 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $51.70 a barrel in New York while Brent crude, the international standard, rose 53 cents, or 1 percent, to $54.89 a barrel in London.
Gold for April delivery rose $4.80 to $1,251.70 an ounce. The dollar fell to 110.78 yen from 110.86 yen. The euro fell to $1.0646 from $1.0667.
Constellation Brands, a conglomerate of wine, liquor and beer names, jumped after it reported a larger profit and better sales than analysts expected. The company said its beer business, which includes Corona and Modelo labels, had a strong quarter, and it raised its profit forecast for the year. Its stock gained $10.37, or 6.4 percent, to $171.77.
Sunoco climbed after it agreed to sell most of its convenience stores to 7-Eleven. Sunoco will get $3.3 billion and 7-Eleven will acquire 1,100 stores, mostly in the East Coast and Texas. Sunoco also struck a fuel supply deal with a 7-Eleven subsidiary and it plans to sell 200 more convenience stores in a separate deal. Shares of Sunoco jumped $4.83, or 20.2 percent, to $28.69.

An Expensive Price for Panera, but JAB Has Deep Pockets

Full text: Consolidation is fueling inflation in the fast-food market in the United States. JAB Holding Company, the privately held owner of Krispy Kreme, Peet's Coffee and other assets, is paying $7.5 billion, including debt, for Panera Bread. That's a stratospheric 41 times projected earnings for 2017. The buyer has deep pockets and no pesky shareholders to answer to, and its target has one of the industry's strongest growth rates. But such a lofty valuation will have few rivals.
The latest in a string of fast-food mergers, the deal is the largest ever for an American restaurant chain and not far behind the $12.6 billion that the buyout firm 3G's restaurant vehicle paid for Tim Hortons of Canada in 2014. The enterprise value is nearly 17 times this year's forecast earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, compared with the 10.4 times historical Ebitda that Darden Restaurants paid for Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen last month.
Panera's valuation is as rich as many of its menu items, like the 800-calorie kitchen sink cookie. But JAB, the investment vehicle of Germany's billionaire Reimann family, is not one to let price get in the way of its appetite. It invests for a decade or more and has already shown a willingness to pay handsomely for strong brands like Peet's, the European coffee roaster Jacobs Douwe Egberts, the cosmetics house Coty and the stiletto-maker Jimmy Choo.
With Panera, JAB is getting above-average growth. The company is aggressively introducing digital ordering and payment kiosks to speed customers through its more than 2,000 outlets. It's also introducing delivery service and making a play for the health-conscious with a new line of no-sugar-added beverages.
Such initiatives helped bolster same-store sales by 5.3 percent in the first three months of 2017. That compares well to the average drop across the industry of 2.7 percent in the three months to the end of February, according to Black Box Intelligence.
JAB's move may encourage others to move quickly while there are still plenty of pickings in the fragmented fast-food industry. But acquisitions at this level can lead to indigestion.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve expects to start reducing its huge investment holdings later this year, unwinding a giant program undertaken in the wake of the financial crisis to revive the economy. The holdings -- which amount to more than $4 trillion in Treasuries and mortgage securities -- are a legacy of the Fed's campaign to help the economy recover from the depths of a recession. The Fed, increasingly confident that the American economy is "at or near maximum employment," is beginning to loosen its grip on the economy, according to an official account that the Fed published Wednesday.
Officials voted at the meeting in March to raise the Fed's benchmark interest rate -- the third time since the financial crisis -- to a range of 0.75 percent to 1 percent. Since the meeting, Fed officials have said that it is on course to increase rates by at least an additional half a percentage point this year.
Both the low rates and the investments were intended to support growth by encouraging risk-taking and borrowing by consumers and businesses. Now the Fed is gradually reducing that support.
No decision was made about the timing or the details of any move to reduce the Fed's holdings.
The markets took the news with relative calm, suggesting that investors share the central bank's assessment that the economy is getting closer to walking without crutches. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury has traded in a narrow range since December, even as the Fed has raised rates twice.
Indeed, some analysts said the Fed might need to take stronger steps to end its stimulus campaign.
"Financial conditions remain very accommodative, and in our view the central bank has more work to do to minimize the risks of financial imbalances building up in worrisome ways," said Bob Miller, the head of BlackRock's fixed income team.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dipped after the Fed's account was published at 2 p.m., closing at 2,352.95, down 0.31 percent on the day. But the index has still climbed more than 5 percent so far this year.
Some Fed officials also are nervous about the stock market's climb, the account said. It noted that stock prices are "quite high relative to standard valuation measures," and that some Fed officials saw a risk to the economy "if, for example, financial markets were to experience a significant correction."
The Fed accumulated trillions in Treasuries and mortgage securities in a series of campaigns after the 2008 financial crisis as part of its effort to put downward pressure on borrowing costs. It has maintained the size of those holdings by reinvesting the proceeds from maturing securities; it can shrink the portfolio by doing nothing -- simply refraining from investing in replacement securities.
Accumulating the bonds forced other investors to compete for the remaining stock by accepting lower interest rates from borrowers. That amplifies the effect of the Fed's primary tool, its direct suppression of short-term rates. Shrinking the portfolio would gradually reduce the force of that effect, easing downward pressure on rates.
"It wouldn't surprise me if sometime later this year or sometime in 2018, should the economy perform in line with our expectations, that we'll start to gradually let securities mature rather than reinvesting them," William C. Dudley, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, told Bloomberg Television last week.
Mr. Dudley said the Fed might take a break from raising short-term interest rates as it begins to reduce the balance sheet, to appraise the consequences.
The meeting account said that Fed must decide whether to end reinvestment abruptly or gradually, and whether to deal with Treasuries and mortgage bonds on the same timetable. The account said the discussion would continue at the Fed's next policy meeting, on May 2 and 3.
The meeting account also emphasized that the Fed's economic outlook has held steady in recent months. Fed officials have said they do not see evidence of an improvement in the nation's economic trajectory since the election of President Trump. But growth has remained strong enough to move forward with rate increases.
The Fed account said "nearly all participants" have concluded that the American economy is "at or near maximum employment." The unemployment rate was 4.7 percent in February, a level consistent with the normal churn of hiring and firing.
Inflation, sluggish since the crisis, had also perked. Though, most Fed officials were not yet satisfied with this count. "Nearly all members judged that the committee has not yet achieved its objective for headline inflation on a sustained basis," the account said. The Fed wanted prices to rise about 2 percent a year.
The Fed, which predicted a continued improvement in economic conditions at the start of the year, has said that it expects to raise rates three times in 2017. It now appears the Fed may take the additional step of beginning to shrink its investment holdings by the end of the year, somewhat earlier than expected.
The Fed has said its forecasts do not incorporate the potential impact of policy changes proposed by Mr. Trump. The central bank has adopted a wait-and-see posture. The account said most officials do not expect any impact before 2018.
"Members continued to judge that there was significant uncertainty about the effects of possible changes in fiscal and other government policies," the account said, "but that near-term risks to the economic outlook appeared roughly balanced."
Some Fed officials have said -- in the weeks since the meeting -- that it might be necessary to move more quickly. Eric Rosengren, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, said last week the Fed should raise rates four times this year.
"The perception seems to be that the outcome of each FOMC meeting depends on nuances of incoming data, with the base case being no change in rates," Mr. Rosengren said of the Fed's policy-making arm, the Federal Open Market Committee. "My own view is that an increase at every other FOMC meeting over the course of this year could and should be the committee's default."
One official did worry that the Fed was moving too fast: Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, voted against raising interest rates, saying it was not clear how much slack was in the labor market, and that inflation remained weak.

Full text: A big rally in stocks evaporated Wednesday as the Federal Reserve appeared to struggle with questions related to inflation and government policy and suggested it might start trimming its balance sheet later in the year. Stocks had jumped early on after the payroll processor ADP said private businesses added 263,000 jobs in March, which was more than analysts expected. The Dow Jones industrial average rose as much as 198 points, and the Nasdaq composite reached an intraday high.
But stocks started falling after 2 p.m. Eastern, when the Federal Reserve disclosed the minutes from its policy meeting last month. The minutes showed Fed officials discussing plans to reduce the Fed's bond holdings later this year and disagreeing over whether it would be safe to let inflation rise faster and how to deal with the economic impact of President Trump's stimulus ideas.
At the close, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 7.21 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,352.95. The Dow sank 41.09 points, or 0.2 percent, to 20,648.15. The Nasdaq fell 34.13 points, or 0.6 percent, to 5,864.48.
The Federal Reserve had bought trillions of dollars' worth of bonds during the financial crisis in an effort to stimulate the economy. When its bonds mature, it has continued to buy new ones. But now, the Fed may stop reinvesting, which would gradually shrink its holdings.
That sent bond prices surging and yields tumbling. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.34 percent from 2.36 percent.
When bond yields fall, interest rates fall with them. That tends to hurt banks because it means reduced profits on lending, and banks took the largest losses Wednesday. JPMorgan Chase dropped $1.12, or 1.3 percent, to $86.19 and BB&T shed 56 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $43.98.
Banks made strong gains in early trading but they wound up with much bigger losses than the rest of the market.
For the past couple of months it seemed investors and the Fed understood each other well, as the central bank indicated it intended to keep raising interest rates gradually, assuming the economy continued to grow at a steady clip. It raised rates in December and March. The uncertainty reflected in the Fed's March meeting may challenge that understanding.
The chain Panera agreed to be acquired by JAB Holding of Europe for $315 a share. JAB has quietly become a rival to Starbucks in recent years as it owns, or has a large stake in, a series of brands that includes Peet's Coffee & Tea, Caribou Coffee, Stumptown Coffee, Keurig Green Mountain and Krispy Kreme Doughnuts. Panera stock jumped in recent days thanks to rumors about a deal. It rose $38.94, or 14.2 percent, to $312.94. The stock was trading at $230 a share a month ago.
Monsanto reported profit and sales that were far better than analysts expected. Monsanto said profits from its corn and soybean businesses grew in the fiscal second quarter. It also backed its forecasts for the year and said its sale to Bayer of Germany should close by the end of the year. The stock rose $1.10, or 1 percent, to $115.31.
Crude oil futures for May delivery fell 35 cents to $51.15 a barrel in New York. Brent, the international standard, gained 19 cents to $54.36 a barrel in London.
Gold for April delivery sank $9.60 to $1,245.40 an ounce. Those moves reflected investors' earlier optimism, as precious metals trading ends before stock trading does.
The dollar rose to 110.86 yen from 110.65 yen. The euro fell to $1.0667 from $1.0670.
The FTSE 100 index in Britain gained 0.1 percent. In France, the CAC 40 lost 0.2 percent and the DAX in Germany fell 0.5 percent.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Bursts of Praise Amid Gathering Clouds

Full text: The National Endowment for the Arts will hand out prizes to five jazz luminaries on Monday in the 35th annual N.E.A. Jazz Masters award ceremony. But a thread of anxiety is likely to run through the proceedings at the Kennedy Center in Washington. President Trump's budget proposal last month called for eliminating the endowment entirely -- the first time any president has proposed such a step. While some members of Congress in his own Republican Party have opposed the move, it is a reminder of the agency's vulnerability.
"It would be foolish for us to pretend like we have a crystal ball," said Ann Meier Baker, the endowment's director of music and opera, adding, "The president's blueprint was Step 1, and there are many to come" before a budget is passed.
"We continue to do our work," she said.
Created in 1965, the endowment provides funding to arts organizations, including jazz projects that are supported with dozens of grants each year. It also sends nearly half of its funding budget to regional arts organizations that disperse funds themselves.
This year's Jazz Masters -- the vocalist Dee Dee Bridgewater, the organist Dr. Lonnie Smith, the pianist and composer Dick Hyman, the bassist Dave Holland and the jazz historian Ira Gitler -- each received their award's $25,000 cash portion last year.
In many cases, their careers have been affected by the endowment in ways that stretch back much further.
Ms. Bridgewater, a three-time Grammy winner, is known not only as a musician but also as the host of "JazzSet," a program on NPR that ran for over 20 years and often received endowment funding. The show was canceled in 2014, partly because of difficulties finding funds, Ms. Bridgewater said -- two years after it received its last endowment grant.
The endowment also backs festivals across the country, including the Savannah Jazz Festival in Georgia, where Mr. Smith will perform this year, and the Alcorn State University Jazz Festival, in Mississippi, where this month Ramsey Lewis, a 2007 Jazz Master, will perform and teach a class.
"It's not just an academic thing," Mr. Smith said of receiving an award from the agency. "Because they not only help us, but they help schools, and everything else."
Each year since 2004 the endowment has awarded an A. B. Spellman N.E.A. Jazz Masters Award for Jazz Advocacy to one nonmusician. Last year it went to Wendy Oxenhorn, who runs the Jazz Foundation of America. Her group supports elderly or infirm jazz musicians, often in the form of free health care or financial assistance. It relies partly on endowment funding.
The endowment has given the Jazz Foundation grants of up to $50,000 a year. When she received her award last year, Ms. Oxenhorn noticed an influx of interest and support from donors.
"I saw a huge difference in that people knew of us that had never known," she said. "People wrote to us saying, 'We had never known about you, and I saw your speech, and we realize now that it's wonderful, and we want to help."'
The foundation has assisted a handful of Jazz Masters, along with hundreds of other musicians.
Between 2005 and 2016, the agency gave about $2.8 million a year in direct grants to jazz-related projects across the country. That does not count the jazz-related awards from state and regional agencies funded partly by the agency.
In recent years the endowment's annual congressional appropriation has hovered just under $150 million -- lower than the median allotment over its 51-year history, when adjusting for inflation. By international standards, it is not especially high. The budget of the Paris National Opera alone is higher.
Especially since the 1980s and early '90s, when conservatives led by Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina put the agency in the cross hairs, the endowment has worked to ensure that its funding is spread throughout the 50 states and not concentrated on the coasts.
And it has worked in recent years to support smaller and less institutionally recognized organizations and artists.
But the agency does not necessarily lift all boats equally. Some notable musicians outside the New York spotlight -- say, the Chicago saxophonist and organizer Fred Anderson and the Los Angeles pianist Horace Tapscott -- died without receiving recognition as a Jazz Master.
What's more, of 145 Jazz Masters thus far, fewer than 20 have been women.
But for this year's round, the award is a welcome affirmation from an organization that connotes a vote of public confidence.
"There's a respect for human dignity that goes along with the N.E.A., NPR, PBS, because the people that work for these institutions are publicly supported," Ms. Bridgewater said. "They're providing resources for people across these United States."

Leftist Appears Headed for a Victory in Ecuador

Full text: Lenín Moreno, a 64-year-old former vice president of Ecuador, appeared headed to a second-round win in the country's presidential election on Sunday. It would be a rare victory for the Latin American left, which has recently suffered stinging election defeats. With more than 90 percent of the votes counted, Mr. Moreno, a close ally of departing President Rafael Correa, had won 51 percent of the vote, while his opponent, Guillermo Lasso, a 61-year-old banker, had won 49 percent, according to early figures published by Ecuador's electoral commission.
While Mr. Moreno quickly declared victory on Sunday night, his opponent did not concede, saying all the votes needed to be counted.
The race was closely watched in the region, where, time and again, leftist stalwarts who rose to power on populism and high commodity prices have seen their fortunes turn.
Liberal movements in Venezuela, Argentina and Bolivia have been rebuffed by voters in recent elections as their economies have stumbled. Brazil's leftist president, Dilma Rousseff, was brought down by impeachment last year.
In the end, it was the candidate named for the founder of Russian Communism who was favored to win.
Mr. Moreno has promised to push forward the so-called Citizens' Revolution of his predecessor, which funneled state funds back to the poor in the form of education, housing and infrastructure.
In a speech on Sunday, Mr. Moreno said it became clear during his travels that he had the support of ordinary Ecuadoreans. "Since before we claimed victory, we knew it, we felt it," he said.
Yet maintaining Mr. Correa's momentum could prove hard. There is the issue of oil revenues, for one, which have stagnated. The economy has ground to a halt after years of high growth.
There is also the figure of Mr. Correa himself, a strong-willed populist who ruled for a decade, created a new Constitution and lifted large sections of his nation out of poverty. Few expect that the mild-mannered Mr. Moreno can sustain his success.
"The economic orientation will change; the social emphasis will change," said Simón Pachano, a political analyst based in Quito, the capital.
Still, Mr. Moreno's vision differed sharply from that of his opponent, Mr. Lasso, who lost to Mr. Correa by a larger margin in 2013.
Mr. Lasso, from the port city of Guayaquil, had promised to cut back on what he called the excesses of the previous president, including by reducing the public-sector work force and government spending. He also proposed cutting taxes for the wealthy and for businesses.
Each candidate faced a steep climb to the presidency. Mr. Moreno was criticized for being too close to Mr. Correa, whose decade in power ended with accusations of corruption involving public infrastructure projects. Mr. Correa earned a harsh reputation for attacking critics, suing journalists and, on his state television show, angrily reading the names of those who had sent tweets that reflected poorly on him.
But for many, Mr. Lasso was never able to overcome his history as banker in a country that has been rocked by financial crises and inflation.
His opponents hammered him throughout the campaign for his past positions in the government of Jamil Mahuad, the Ecuadorean president who moved the country onto the United States dollar after a banking crisis destroyed its national currency, the sucre.
The financial collapse, known as the "bank holiday" in Ecuador, prompted a migration of more than 1.5 million people, most of whom sought work in the United States and Europe. The country limped by in negotiations with creditors for years until Mr. Correa took Ecuador into default, calling the foreign debt "immoral."
More recently, an Argentine newspaper published what it said were documents showing that Mr. Lasso had shuttled financial gains he made during the country's economic crisis into an offshore account. Mr. Lasso denied wrongdoing, but Mr. Correa said the candidate was under investigation.
Mr. Moreno, by contrast, presented a softer image.
Known to be more humorous and conciliatory than Mr. Correa, he appeared in campaign stops in his wheelchair, which he has used since he was shot during a robbery in the late 1990s. He is probably best known for his social programs, which have helped people with disabilities in Ecuador.
"We can't lose what's been given to the poor," said Edwin Tatés, who works as a driver in Quito and voted for Mr. Moreno.
He added, "This government has had many errors, above all those of Correa, who has fought with everyone, but we need to change things for the good of the country, not to change the whole government."

Full text: Here's a look at what's coming up this week. AUTO INDUSTRY
A likely uptick in new-car sales may mask a weak market.
Auto manufacturers on Monday are set to report new car sales for March, and a rise of about 2 percent from March 2016 is expected, to around 1.6 million light vehicles. But analysts warn that the increase may be masking market weakness. Edmunds.com has noted that inventories have risen to their highest level in more than a decade, incentives are rising and loan terms are lengthening -- all indications that sales aren't coming as easily as they have in the past few years. And even with a rise in March, sales in the first quarter are likely to be flat compared with a year earlier. Neal E. Boudette
ECONOMY
The Fed's top regulator heads for retirement after one more speech.
The Federal Reserve governor Daniel Tarullo does not have celebrity status, but for the past eight years he has been the nation's most important financial regulator -- the Fed's point man on strengthening financial regulation in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. He plans to retire this week, but he will give one more speech, on Tuesday at Princeton University. With the Trump administration threatening to dismantle much of his work, Mr. Tarullo is not likely to miss the chance to mount a final defense of the need for financial regulation.

BANKING
The Chase chief's annual letter to shareholders is due on Tuesday.
On Tuesday morning, Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, is expected to release his annual letter to shareholders. Over the years, the letter has become a must-read for many in the business world. Warren E. Buffett, the billionaire investor, is said to be among the fans of Mr. Dimon's yearly musings on the economy, regulations and, of course, banking. This year, investors will be looking to see whether Mr. Dimon weighs in on the Trump administration's big policy initiatives, like rolling back free trade and corporate taxes. Michael Corkery
ECONOMY
The Fed's actions in March point to confidence in recovery.
The Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate in March for the third time since the financial crisis, a sign of confidence in the health of the economic recovery. The question now is how many more times the Fed plans to raise rates this year. The Fed's latest round of forecasts, also published in March, still predicts three increases. But some Fed officials say a fourth rise may be necessary as growth chugs along and inflation picks up. The Fed will add another dollop of information on Wednesday when it publishes an account of the March meeting. Binyamin Appelbaum
TRADE POLICY
Trump will meet the Chinese president over two days.
President Trump's meeting with President Xi Jinping of China at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida on Thursday and Friday leaves both sides with difficult choices about whether to emphasize geopolitical priorities or bilateral trade goals. The United States wants China's help in confronting North Korea, while China wants the United States to play a lesser role in the South China Sea and Taiwan. But the United States also wants China to reduce its many barriers to imports, curb subsidies to exporters and stop forcing foreign companies to transfer technology to Chinese competitors as a condition for entering the Chinese market. And China wants America to limit anti-dumping and anti-subsidy cases against Chinese companies by labeling China a market economy, and wants Mr. Trump to stop emphasizing the bilateral trade deficit.
Mr. Trump signed an executive order on Friday calling for the government to study trade problems exhaustively for the next 90 days. Demanding an in-depth study buys time for the administration to seek Senate confirmation of appointees to a long list of unfilled trade policy-making posts, then decide what its exact trade priorities will be.

ECONOMY
March data will probably show a slight hiring slowdown.
On Friday at 8:30 a.m., the Labor Department will release data on unemployment and hiring in March. Economists are looking for a gain of 180,000 jobs for the month, and for the unemployment rate to remain 4.7 percent.
After unexpectedly robust gains of 238,000 jobs in January and 235,000 in February, experts expect data to show that March hiring, though still healthy, was slower. The survey week for data coincided with March's winter storm in much of the country, which could skew the figures. Nelson D. Schwartz

Full text: Despite an eight-day losing streak that ended on Tuesday, the stock market has generally been buoyant in the opening weeks of the Trump administration. The bullish mood could be a self-fulfilling prophecy and lead to continuing gains for a while. Yet important measurements -- some of which I developed -- tell us that the market is quite expensive and that investor optimism is tinged with plenty of worry. None of this tells us where the market is going tomorrow, but it suggests that some caution is advisable, and that returns over the next decade or so are likely to be constrained.
Consider first the evidence from what is often called the Shiller CAPE ratio.
What is CAPE, or the cyclically adjusted price-earnings ratio, exactly? Bear with me. This is a bit technical: It is real, or inflation-adjusted, stock price divided by a 10-year average of real earnings. It is usually measured using the price and earnings of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, adjusted for inflation with the Consumer Price Index. In 1988, John Y. Campbell (now at Harvard) and I showed in a joint article that such a ratio has, since 1881, forecast returns somewhat well in the stock market. That "somewhat" is important because the ratio has its limits as a forecasting tool.
We found back then that averaging earnings over 10 years smoothed short-run or cyclical fluctuations, providing a better indicator of fundamental value. The CAPE ratio has successfully explained about a third of the variation in real 10-year stock market returns in United States history since 1881.
This is the important point: In 1988, we found that CAPE had averaged about 15 since 1881. In years when CAPE was lower than that, subsequent 10-year returns for the stock market tended to be good. In years when it was higher, the 10-year returns tended to be bad.
That's why today's CAPE is sending a troubling message. The ratio is now almost 30. Using monthly data, it has been higher only in 1929, when it reached 33, and in the few years around 2000, when it reached 44. In both instances, sharp market declines followed those very high readings. The current level of CAPE suggests a dim outlook for the American stock market over the next 10 years or so, but it does not tell us for sure nor does it say when to expect a decline. As I said, CAPE is useful, but it does not provide a clear guide to the future.
Investor sentiment is another factor, and current readings also give us cause for concern.
I have been involved in regular opinion surveys of institutional and individual investors in the United States since 1989. These surveys are undertaken and published online by the Yale School of Management. From these data, I created a Valuation Confidence Index, which is the percent of respondents who think the domestic stock market is not overvalued; a Crash Confidence Index, which is the percent who think that a 1929- or 1987-style crash in the next six months is highly unlikely; and a One-Year Confidence Index, which is the percent who think the stock market will go up in the next year. The indexes are measured in six-month intervals, and our latest data are for the six months through February, which includes the election of President Trump on Nov. 8, 2016.
Valuation confidence in February was quite low. The only time it has been lower was in the years surrounding the market peak of 2000. In February, crash confidence was quite low too, though it has been slightly lower on a number of occasions since 1989. These two indicators might seem to confirm the apparent signal of the CAPE ratio: trouble ahead. They are certainly saying that investors aren't confident that current prices are reasonable or that the market is stable.
But one metric went the opposite direction. One-year confidence is at a record high for institutional investors, and it is at the highest level since 2007 for individual investors. (That means, by the way, that in 2007, the eve of the Great Recession and financial crisis, most people had no clue that big problems were imminent.)
It is hard to reconcile these results. One possible interpretation might be that respondents perceive a stock market bubble: They think valuations are high and there is a non-negligible probability of a crash. At the same time, they are hanging in because they think the Trump boom will probably last for at least another year.
That doesn't provide much reassurance. The high fraction of our survey respondents who think that the stock market is unlikely to fall in the next year may simply reflect a failure of imagination about how a Trump bull market could suddenly end. There are scores of ways, of course. Just because people can't picture a big decline doesn't mean that they won't react very badly if the market comes under real stress.
Many people appear to believe that a business-oriented president will preside over a long stock market boom. At a glance, there appears to be some precedent for this, first with the 1920 election that brought in President Warren G. Harding and Vice President Calvin Coolidge (who took over when Harding died in 1923) and then with the 1980 victory of Ronald Reagan. These elections were followed by the Roaring Twenties of 1921 to 1929 and the Millennium Boom market of 1982 to 2000.
But in both cases, during the initial election campaigns the economy was in recession and the CAPE ratio was extremely low -- around 5 in 1920 and 9 in 1980.
We are in a very different situation now. The economy has largely recovered from the last recession, and CAPE shows us that stocks are now relatively expensive.
There is no clear message from all of this. Long-term investors shouldn't be alarmed and shouldn't avoid stocks altogether. But my bottom line is that the high pricing of the market -- and the public perception that the market is indeed highly priced -- are the most important factors for the current market outlook. And those factors are negative.
We don't know where the market will go this month or this year. It could well rise a lot. But investors should not let themselves be tempted to bet aggressively on the Trump bull market.

Full text: CORRECTION APPENDED. One conservative group produced colorful flow charts warning millennials that a "border adjustment" tax proposed by Speaker Paul D. Ryan would raise prices on "the Jose Cuervo tequila that's in your happy hour margarita."
Three days later, a second conservative group kicked off a lobbying campaign saying it would amount to a $1.2 trillion tax on seniors and the working poor.
The next day, still another group weighed in, issuing a news release that highlighted how Latinos would be "among those hardest hit" by the new tax on imports.
All three organizations share a common lineage: They are part of the political network overseen by Charles D. and David H. Koch, the billionaire conservative businessmen. Now they are among a host of conservative organizations mounting a furious campaign against a new tax on imports proposed by House Republicans, imperiling what is supposed to be a centerpiece of the Republican tax overhaul effort.
Their opposition threatens yet another rupture with President Trump, some of whose advisers see the provision as a critical way to bring about tax reform while protecting American manufacturers.
The battle could not only jeopardize Mr. Trump's second major legislative initiative, but also redefine the boundaries of conservative economic policy. Much like the failed repeal of the Affordable Care Act, the import tax is dividing conservatives, the business sector and some of the deepest-pocketed groups funding conservative politics. Along the way, it is exposing the broader ideological divide between nationalist policies embraced by Mr. Trump and the traditional small-government movement that his election ejected from the driver's seat of Republican policy-making.
"Trump ran on a different set of economic issues than traditional conservative Republicans have," said Stephen Moore, a fellow at the Heritage Foundation who favors the border tax on intellectual grounds, but said he had come to see it as a "poison pill" for broader tax reform.
"The baton has been passed on from Reagan to Trump," Mr. Moore continued, "and there's no doubt he ran on a much more populist economic message."
The idea of a border adjustment tax has percolated among academic economists and in think tanks since the 1970s, as the United States has considered ways of harmonizing its tax code with countries that use value-added taxes. Central to the plan is a provision that would tax imports at a rate of 20 percent while exempting exports from taxation. In theory, this would buttress domestic manufacturing, make American products more competitive with foreign goods and encourage American companies to bring home cash they have been parking overseas.
"It is a simple and elegant way to get good tax compliance," said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a Republican economist and president of the right-leaning American Action Forum, a nonprofit tied to a "super PAC" that backs House Republicans.
Some conservatives oppose it for the same reason: In their view, such a tax would be too easy to increase, with the potential costs to Americans hidden behind rising prices.
Groups like Americans for Tax Reform -- headed by Grover Norquist, perhaps Washington's most famous anti-tax crusader -- have praised the border tax proposal, saying it would put American businesses "on a level playing field" with foreign competitors. Retailers that import many of their goods are lobbying against the idea, while domestic manufacturers like Boeing and Caterpillar -- whose interests figure heavily in Mr. Trump's economic thinking -- are supporting it.
The Koch network and groups like the Club for Growth, which for years have targeted what they call "crony capitalism" in Washington, have opposed the border tax as an unnecessary tax increase and a form of favoritism that would hurt the economy. But Mr. Trump and his team have pledged to target what they see as a more insidious kind of cronyism, including unfettered free trade that some Trump advisers say benefits wealthy elites at the expense of American workers.
The dispute echoes Mr. Trump's battles with his party last year, when the Club for Growth, a group of wealthy conservatives that backs anti-tax candidates in Republican primary races, financed a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign against him. The Koch network, uncomfortable with Mr. Trump's proposals on trade and immigration, sat out the presidential election entirely, turning its advertising dollars and activists to down-ballot races.
Both the Club for Growth and the Koch network also played a critical role in killing a proposal backed by Mr. Ryan and Mr. Trump to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. In March, as the repeal vote approached, two Koch-aligned groups pledged to spend upward of $1 million on ads defending any Republican who voted against the replacement legislation.
Now, some of the same groups are organizing visits to lawmakers and paying for an online advertising campaign attacking the border tax proposal.
The roster includes Americans for Prosperity, the Koch network's flagship political advocacy group; the Libre Initiative, which is aimed at Latinos; and Generation Opportunity, which focuses on young adults. In 2015, the most recent year for which tax returns are available, the three groups took in a combined $34 million from Freedom Partners, an umbrella group representing the Kochs and other donors who pool money for political and educational initiatives.
Policy experts at think tanks financed by the Koch network have also weighed in against the border tax idea. Veronique de Rugy, a senior fellow at the Mercatus Center, where Charles Koch sits on the board, has clashed with Mr. Holtz-Eakin and other right-leaning policy experts, accusing them of misleading the public about the true effects of the border tax on economic growth.
Americans for Prosperity is calling on Mr. Trump to rely more on spending cuts, rather than on a border adjustment tax, to finance the tax overhaul. The group's list of proposals include indexing Social Security benefits to a different measure of inflation -- a popular idea in conventional conservative circles but one that could violate Mr. Trump's campaign pledge to protect the program's beneficiaries.
"When you look at the network broadly, we're all guided by the same vision," said James Davis, a spokesman for Freedom Partners. "We're all going to be active on the major policy decisions that are happening in Washington."
That campaign has aligned with a vigorous lobbying campaign by Koch Industries, one of the largest private companies in the United States, prompting complaints from some proponents of the tax that the family is chiefly interested in protecting its business. Last fall, after the House plan for a border tax was first unveiled, lobbyists from Koch Industries circulated a study by PricewaterhouseCoopers showing it would lead to huge new taxes on the petroleum and coal products industry, which includes some of Koch Industries' most profitable subsidiaries.
More recently, Koch has circulated studies indicating that the tax would increase the price of gasoline, which the company says would lift its profits in the short term but harm the economy in the long term.
Philip Ellender, a top executive at the company, said in an interview that Koch Industries was lobbying against the new tax out of principle, not for profit.
"In the short term, Koch would profit handsomely from it," Mr. Ellender said. His summary of the company's case against the tax: "It would stifle free trade, it picks winners and losers, and it raises prices on consumers so that corporations can get a tax break."
The debate has divided the White House, too.
In an interview with Reuters in late February, Mr. Trump embraced the notion of a border tax. "I certainly support a form of tax on the border," he said, arguing that it would encourage companies to bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States, a critical component of his platform.
Mr. Trump's Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, and his top economic adviser, Gary Cohn -- both former Goldman Sachs bankers -- are said to be leery of the border tax. Mr. Trump's chief strategist, the former Breitbart publisher Stephen K. Bannon, has supported it, as has Peter Navarro, a trade skeptic and top White House trade adviser.
A profusion of strategic and political motives also divides Republicans on the issue. To enact a tax overhaul that does not increase the federal deficit but delivers rate cuts to wealthy taxpayers and corporations, Mr. Trump and Congress need to find some source of new revenue -- hence the border tax. For Mr. Ryan, who holds more conventional free-trade views than Mr. Trump, the new tax provides a way to satisfy Mr. Trump's protectionist impulses without imposing punitive, and potentially even more disruptive, tariffs.
But some conservatives are not so sure. In opposing the tax, Senator Tom Cotton, a Republican from Walmart's home state, Arkansas, finds himself in the position of defending his local corporate giant and the conservatism that he thought he knew.
"Most conservatives I know have long believed that tax reform would look at all of the carve-outs in the tax code," Mr. Cotton said, "not introduce a whole new concept of taxation."
Correction: April 4, 2017, Tuesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Sunday about tax reform efforts supported by conservative groups referred incorrectly to one proposal for indexing Social Security benefits. The proposal includes indexing those benefits to a different measure of inflation, not to inflation.

Major Indexes End Solid Quarter With Small Letdown

Full text: Wall Street closed a solid quarter Friday with a day of listless trading that ended on a soft note. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index had its best three-month stretch since the fourth quarter of 2015. The Nasdaq composite index had its best quarter since the end of 2013.
The S.&P. 500 index ended the first three months of 2017 with a gain of 5.5 percent, the Nasdaq posted an increase of 9.8 percent and the Dow Jones industrial average rose 4.6 percent.
The three indexes ended the day down slightly. Financial companies declined most, and real estate companies led gainers.
Trading was largely subdued, suggesting portfolio managers looking to bolster their end-of-quarter performance had acted earlier in the week, said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial.
"The market has performed very well," she said.
The Dow slid 65.27 points, or 0.3 percent, to 20,663.22. The S.&P. 500 lost 5.34 points, or 2 percent, to 2,362.72. The Nasdaq fell 2.61 points to 5,911.74. The index hit a record high Thursday.
Small-company stocks outperformed the rest of the market. The Russell 2000 index picked up 3.57 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,385.92.
Bond prices edged higher. The 10-year Treasury yield fell to 2.39 percent from 2.42 percent late Thursday.
The major stock indexes had a downbeat start Friday and spent much of the day wavering between small gains and losses as investors weighed several corporate deals and new data on consumer spending and inflation.
The Commerce Department said consumer spending kept rising in February, though gains in the last two months were slow. An inflation gauge closely watched by the Federal Reserve increased 2.1 percent in February compared with a year ago, a five-year high.
That data followed positive reports on consumer confidence, housing and economic growth this week, which added to the market's expectation for stronger first-quarter corporate earnings.
"The market is moving ahead into the second quarter with valuations that are high, but the expectations are that the first-quarter earnings season will confirm the valuations," Ms. Krosby said.
On Friday, investors bid up shares in companies with better-than-expected earnings.
DXP Enterprises, an industrial products company, jumped $5.13, or 15.7 percent, to $37.87, while BlackBerry rose $0.80, or 11.5 percent, to $7.75.
Auto dealership companies were among the decliners Friday. AutoNation fell $1.20, or 2.8 percent, to $42.29. CarMax slid 84 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $59.22.
Shares in FMC, a chemical company, rose after it agreed to buy part of DuPont's crop protection business. DuPont will buy FMC's health and nutrition unit. DuPont also will get $1.6 billion, mostly in cash. FMC jumped $8.09, or 13.2 percent, to $69.59. DuPont shares fell $1.31, or 1.6 percent, to $80.33.
Germany's DAX rose 0.5 percent, while France's CAC 40 gained 0.7 percent. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares fell 0.6 percent.
Tokyo's Nikkei 225 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng fell 0.8 percent.
After an early slide, benchmark crude added 25 cents and closed at $50.60 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to set international oil prices, slipped 13 cents to close at $52.83 a barrel in London.
Gold futures for April delivery rose $2.30 to $1247.30 an ounce. Silver added 5 cents to $18.26 an ounce. Copper slipped 2 cents to $2.65 a pound.
The euro weakened to $1.0669 from $1.0678 on Thursday. The dollar fell to 111.32 yen from 111.78 yen.

Full text: Wall Street gained ground on Thursday, led by financial shares, after data showed economic growth was stronger than previously reported last quarter, helped by robust consumer spending. The energy sector rose for a third straight day, supported by stronger oil prices and a 8.8 percent gain for ConocoPhillips after it agreed to sell oil and gas assets. Oil futures closed above the $50 a barrel mark.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose for a third straight day, rebounding from last week's drop.
Growth in the United States economy slowed less than previously reported in the fourth quarter as robust consumer spending provided a boost, the Commerce Department said. Gross domestic product increased at a 2.1 percent annualized rate instead of the previously-reported 1.9 percent pace.
A record-setting rally for stocks in the wake of President Trump's November election stalled somewhat this month, with some investors pointing to risks to Trump's agenda, including a tax overhaul, after his fellow Republicans failed to pass a health care bill.
The G.D.P. report is "basically an affirmation that, hey, at the end of the day, Washington will do and say whatever they are going to do, but the economy is marching forward," said Karyn Cavanaugh, senior market strategist at Voya Investment Management in New York.
"It's not just the U.S. economy, but we do see definitely improvement throughout the world," Ms. Cavanaugh said.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 69.17 points, or 0.33 percent, to 20,728.49, the S.&P. 500 gained 6.93 points, or 0.29 percent, to 2,368.06 and the Nasdaq composite added 16.80 points, or 0.28 percent, to 5,914.34.
The Nasdaq closed at a record high after rising for a fifth straight session.
Financial shares surged 1.2 percent, with Bank of America and Citigroup helping the S.&P. 500.
Investors are also turning their attention to the impending first-quarter earnings season to justify lofty valuations for stocks. The S.&P. 500 is trading at about 18 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months against its long-term average of 15.
First-quarter earnings for S.&P. 500 companies are expected to rise 10.1 percent, according to Thomson Reuters.
"We continue to see decent-to-improving economic data primarily in employment," said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Asset Management in New York. "We are likely to see a good quarter in terms of earnings, so I think there is some anticipation perhaps in the market here."
Oil futures for May delivery closed at $50.35, up 84 cents, in New York. Prices rose after Kuwait gave its backing to extend OPEC production cuts in an attempt to reduce global oversupply.
"There is a significant chance that a short-to-medium-term bottom has been found," said Tamas Varga, analyst at London brokerage PVM Oil Associates.
In corporate news, Lululemon Athletica shares plunged 23.4 percent after the yoga and leisure apparel retailer said first-quarter comparable sales were expected to fall.
The British pound bounced from a one-week low of $1.2375 hit on Wednesday, and was last trading at $1.2471, up 0.0031 on the day.
The dollar index ticked up 0.53 percent, with the euro down 0.80 percent to $1.0678, weakened by the inflation data.
The Mexican peso was on track to post its strongest quarter on record versus the greenback and its best month since at least June 2012, with a March gain of more than 7 percent.
Mexico's central bank raised its benchmark interest rate for the fifth time in a row on Thursday, taking borrowing costs to an eight-year high.
Gold futures for April delivery fell $8.70 to $1,245 an ounce.

Full text: In 1971, William Powell published "The Anarchist Cookbook," a collection of recipes for drugs, weapons, bombs and other forms of mayhem. He saw the book as a manifesto and guide for would-be revolutionaries, while the authorities saw it as a potential threat; the Federal Bureau of Investigation maintained files on the book for years. Mr. Powell died in July, but his death did not become widely known until this month, with the release of "American Anarchist," a documentary film about him.
Here are excerpts from "The Anarchist Cookbook," courtesy of Delta Press, its most-recent publisher.
Foreword
This book is for the people of the United States of America. It is not written for the members of fringe political groups, such as The Weathermen, or The Minutemen. Those radical groups don't need this book. They already know everything that's in here. If the real people of America, the silent majority, are going to survive, they must educate themselves. That is the purpose of this book.
In this day and age, ignorance is not only inexcusable, it is criminal and perhaps fatal. "The Anarchist Cookbook" is not a revolutionary work in itself, just as a gun cannot shoot, but I have a sincere hope that it may stir some stagnant brain cells into action. If the people of the United States do not protect themselves against the fascists, capitalists, and communists, they will not be around much longer. Do I sound like an alarmist? Follow the process of disintegration: from the most immediate capitalist pollution; through the rising inflation, which is creating an atmosphere ripe for communism; to the final repression of the people by the fascists in power.
Maybe I use the term revolution too frequently in this book, without really defining it. I will do so here. I do not particularly like any form of government but, if the majority of the people seem to think that they are incapable of governing themselves and want a government, then I think the principles the United States was born with are about the best there are. So now revolution comes to mean revitalization, bringing America back to where she was two hundred years ago. This is the first time I've thought of myself as a reactionary.
I believe that the people in power -- not only political power, but also economic and social power -- will not non-violently give up that power to the people. Power is not a material possession that can be given, it is the ability to act. Power must be taken, it is never given.
I hope that, by the time the two hundredth anniversary of The First American Revolution rolls around, we will be able to look back at the sixties and early seventies as a dark era in the great history of a free nation.
Introduction
This is not the age of slender men in black capes lurking in alleyways with round bombs, just as it is not the age of political discussions in a Munich beer hall. This is a truly unique age, where the individual has become the supreme agent of anarchist theory, without his even being aware of it. Anarchy can no longer be defined as freedom from oppression or lack of governmental control. It has gone further than that. It has become, especially in the young people today, a state of mind, an essence of being. It can be expressed as "doing their own thing," or maybe just simply having the choice to do or not to do.
Anarchy or anarchistic theory is the only ideology that is in the least bit optimistic. It places the full weight of responsibility where it should be -- on the shoulders of all the people, not just the select few. Its basic premise relies on an unshakable faith in human nature, and the primary goodness of the human race.
Today, young people are not blind idealists. They are perhaps the most rational and practical generation this country has ever seen. There is no great movement comparable to the Russian or French revolutions. There are just a great many individuals working as entities unto themselves, to create a new world order. Today has brought forth a great revival of anarchy in all fields: politics, arts, music, education, and even to a small degree in business. Although this surge of individualism is present, you won't find too many people willing to call it anarchy. But that's just terminology.
An anarchist is not necessarily a revolutionary, although it is more common than not that a person who has attempted to rid himself of exterior controls, for the purpose of developing his own philosophy, will find himself oppressed. This oppression may lead the individual to formulate ideas of insurrection and revolution.
This book is for anarchists -- those who feel able to discipline themselves -- on all the subjects (from drugs, to weapons, to explosives) that are currently illegal and suppressed in this country. It is my firm belief that the only laws an individual can truly respect and obey are those he instills in himself. This is not a revolutionary book in any traditional sense, but its premise is the sanctity of human dignity. If this human individual dignity and pride cannot be attained in the existing social order, there is only one choice for a real man, and that is revolution.
There will never be a traditional revolution in this country, in the sense of the Russian or French revolutions. The revolution in this country has already started. It is a multi-faceted battle on many different fronts. It is a battle politically between the young freedom fighters in Chicago and the stagnant system, represented by arthritic old men making laws they do not understand, and making wars they have no feeling for. It is a battle between the poor blacks and the rich employers. It is a battle between the artists and the censors. It is a battle between the Black Panthers and the police. It is a battle between the welfare mother and the bureaucracy of the city, and surprisingly enough it encompasses the yearly battle between the taxpayer and the Internal Revenue Service. All these battles are but part of a larger war, being fought to liberate the minds and bodies of the people who feel freedom is the most important concept in their lives.
If I could come out in this book and advocate complete revolution and the violent overthrow of the United States of America, without being thrown in jail, I would not have written "The Anarchist Cookbook," and there would be no need for it.
Read this book, but keep in mind that the topics written about here are illegal and constitutes a threat. Also, more importantly, almost all the recipes are dangerous, especially to the individual who plays around with them without knowing what he is doing. Use care, caution, and common sense. This book is not for children or morons.
Hand-to-hand combat
When engaged in hand-to-hand combat, your life is always at stake, and you should recognize that fact. Using any available weapon is just common sense. Throwing sand in the enemy's eyes can result in temporary blindness and confusion; this should be taken advantage of immediately. There is only one purpose in hand-to-hand combat, and that is to kill. Never face an enemy with the idea of knocking him out. The chances are extremely good that he will kill you.
When a weapon is not available, one must resort to the full use of his natural weapons. The natural weapons are: the knife edge of your hands, fingers folded at the second joint or knuckle; the protruding knuckle of your second finger; the heel of your hand; the little finger edge of your hand; your boot; elbow; knees; and teeth.
Attacking is a primary factor. A fight was never won by defensive action, and this is not a high school brawl, this is a matter of life and death. Attack with all your strength. At any point or in any situation some vulnerable point on your enemy's body will be open for attack. Do so screaming, as a scream has two purposes: first, to frighten and confuse your enemy; second, to allow you to take a deep breath, which in turn will put more oxygen in your blood stream, and afford you more strength than you would normally have. Your balance and the balance of your opponent are very important factors; since, if you succeed in making your enemy lose his balance, the chances are nine to one you can kill him in the next move. The best overall stance for hand-to-hand combat is where your feet are spread about a shoulder's width apart, with your right foot about a foot ahead of the left. Both arms should be bent at the elbows parallel to each other, either side of the face and throat. Stand on the balls of your feet, and bend slightly at the waist, somewhat like a boxer's crouch. Employing a yell or scream, or sudden movement with either hand, can throw your enemy off-balance.
There are many vulnerable points to the body, and the next several pages will cover each briefly, with explanations of direct attack.
Explosives and Booby Traps
This chapter is going to kill and maim more people than all the rest put together, because people just refuse to take things seriously. The formulas and recipes in here are real, they can be made by almost anyone, and they can be performed in the kitchen. I offer a serious note of caution. The people in the house on 11th Street (killed in New York City early in 1970 in an explosion caused by bombs they were making) did not know what they were doing. Not only did they kill themselves, but also some innocent people. Ignorance thus not only becomes fatal and inexcusable, but also criminal. If you are not absolutely sure of what you are doing, do not do it.
Explosives, if used with care and all the necessary precautions, are one of the greatest tools any liberation movement can have. Ninety percent of all sabotage is based on some sort of demolitions, or booby traps. Most of the lethal weapons in the previous chapter rely on a small explosive charge. The actual application of explosives can be a really thrilling and satisfying experience. I have a friend who worked with demolitions in the Middle East, and he has told me on several occasions that an explosion for him was an experience very similar to a sexual orgasm. This may seem strange to anyone who has no experience with explosives, but in many regards it is absolutely true. An explosion is an amazing phenomenon. Coupled with the destruction of an object of popular hatred, it can become more than just a chemical reaction. It can take the shape of hope for a nation of oppressed people. It is a total sensual experience. It affects all the senses, and in primitive societies was considered a God, and worshiped. If you have read about any guerrilla struggles, or experienced any, you will realize that an explosion has many effects, especially when it is controlled by the oppressed group. It will confuse the enemy, cause destruction and death, impress and frighten the enemy with the power and technology of the people.
Maybe I should clarify some points for my own moral conscience. These recipes are not in this book for use by a minority. I do not place them here to be used by fringe political groups. They are included in this book to educate, since we have already decided that ignorance is inexcusable, fatal, and criminal. They are for the people, rich and poor, right and left, black, Spanish, white, middle-of-the-road liberals, young and old. This is the type of training the forces of fascism, communism, and capitalism get. It is my belief that all the people should have access to these skills, to be able to repel these oppressive forces.

Full text: Venezuela was once one of Latin America's economic powerhouses and a regional diplomatic heavyweight. To grasp how precipitously its global standing has eroded under President Nicolás Maduro, consider these two recent developments. Last month, the United Nations announced that Venezuela had lost its right to vote in the General Assembly for a second year because it owes tens of millions of dollars in dues. And on Tuesday, against Venezuela's ardent protests, diplomats from across the hemisphere convened a rare meeting in Washington to discuss what it would take to restore democracy and a semblance of order in the autocratic, impoverished and dysfunctional nation.
Tuesday's hearing at the Organization of American States did not result in a clear plan to address Venezuela's political and humanitarian crisis. But the fact it was held at all was deeply embarrassing to Venezuela, which just a decade ago aspired to become a counterbalance to United States power and policy in the region.
Venezuelan diplomats have sought to characterize growing regional opposition to Mr. Maduro's rule as part of an underhanded effort by the United States to justify military intervention. A coalition of O.A.S. members, currently led by Mexico, isn't buying that excuse and is trying to find and broker solutions to the crisis.
One proposal being floated is to expel Venezuela from the organization. While this would be fully justified, given that the government's repression of the political opposition and its dismal human rights record violate the O.A.S. charter, it's hard to see what this would accomplish. Furthermore, it could prompt Mr. Maduro to act even more rashly.
A more fruitful step for the international community would be to find ways to help alleviate Venezuela's immediate problems. The most urgent issue is persuading the government to accept humanitarian aid by putting forward detailed offers of needed food and medicine. A growing number of Venezuelans are going hungry in a food shortage, and dying from treatable ailments in squalid, ill-equipped hospitals.
Another international priority should be to press the government to hold local elections, which were suspended last year, and to release political prisoners, some of whom have been behind bars for years. Until political prisoners are released, the prospects for a restoration of democratic rule are very dim. Finally, the international community could propose specific macroeconomic reforms that could curb Venezuela's runaway inflation and stabilize its currency. Inflation has soared to an estimated 700 percent, while people in this oil-rich nation are left digging through piles of trash for scraps of food.
It's quite likely that Mr. Maduro's government will dismiss all overtures and cast them as meddling by its neighbors. Still, these proposals could become harder to reject if a large international coalition presents them to the Venezuelan people as assistance that should not be interpreted as an affront to their country's sovereignty.

Deregulation Isn't a Quick Fix for Decline in I.P.O.s

Full text: The confirmation hearing last week for Jay Clayton, who has been nominated to head the Securities and Exchange Commission, focused on the continued sluggishness of the market for initial public offerings. Senators pushed the nominee to do something, anything, to revive it. The problem is that there is no magic wand -- including deregulation -- that can fix the decline.
The problems were recently documented in a research note by Credit Suisse titled "The Incredible Shrinking Universe of Stocks." The bank documented that the total number of companies listed on the United States stock market plummeted by nearly half, to 3,671 last year from 7,322 in 1996.
Companies get bought or go out of business, but new companies are not replacing them. In 1996 there were 706 initial public offerings, but in 2016 there were only 105. The downturn affects all sectors, and last year there were only 30 new private equity offerings, the "lowest level since 2009," according to Credit Suisse.
Such shrinkage has prompted hand-wringing for over a decade. At Mr. Clayton's hearing, at least five senators brought it up, pointing to the regulatory burdens on companies going public.
There's only one problem with casting regulation as the villain: There's not much evidence for it.
In 2012, Congress took a stab at fixing the regulatory issues in the Jump-Start Our Business Start-Ups Act. The changes have been well-received by entrepreneurs. Some provisions, like the one allowing for confidential review with the Securities and Exchange Commission, have been particularly popular.
But the JOBS Act has not spurred initial public offerings in any meaningful way. One study found that it may -- may -- have resulted in 21 more new offerings a year, but given the small numbers in the analysis, that is questionable.
Moreover, the JOBS Act has done nothing to revive the market for small companies, those with a market capitalization of under $75 million. They still number less than a handful each year.
And while fingers get pointed at regulation like Sarbanes-Oxley and Dodd-Frank, the number of initial public offerings fell off the cliff in 1996 -- years before either bill was passed. So there must be something more here.
Those who have examined this issue have come up with a number of possible reasons.
The first theory is that the decline is a result of structural changes in the market ecosystem. Jay Ritter, a professor at the University of Florida, has argued that the dearth of initial public offerings has been caused by companies selling out quicker.
The Credit Suisse paper also brings up this theory, noting that mergers are the major cause for companies to be delisted from a stock exchange. It appears that this deal activity has spread to the private markets, co-opting the process of taking companies public.
For example, Cisco Systems purchased AppDynamics on the eve of its market debut. And acquirers seem willing to pay top dollar in these instances, as research and development by many large corporations now consists largely of acquiring smaller, usually private, companies.
This is aptly illustrated by the buying sprees of Google and Facebook, which took candidates to go public -- like Instagram, Nest, Waze and WhatsApp -- out of contention.
Another possibility involves demand. In a paper that I wrote with Robert Bartlett and Paul Rose, we explore this theory. The drop-off in activity is largely attributed to the disappearance of the small offering.
In 1996, average proceeds for an initial public offering were $85.7 million, and 54 percent of these offerings were considered small, with a market capitalization below $75 million in inflation-adjusted dollars. In 2014, however, average proceeds were $186.4 million and only 4 percent of offerings were small.
The market for new issues has moved toward liquidity and bigger stocks. Mutual funds prefer making big investments rather than small ones for liquidity and administrative purposes -- lots of small investments simply require more people and more monitoring.
A third possibility is that companies simply no longer need the public market. The private markets are more efficient, and financing is readily available from venture capitalists and banks.
There are even markets and mechanisms that exist not only to allow for financing, but to allow for selling employees' and founders' shares in private markets. In addition, the JOBS Act allowed companies to expand the number of shareholders and still be private, a change that encouraged companies to remain private.
There are other theories. One of these notes that the 1990s saw a surge in I.P.O. activity and that we are just back to what the activity was in the 1970s and '80s. Who is to say what is a normal market?
Another possible reason is that companies are shying away from the public markets to avoid shareholder activism, short-termism and the glare of public scrutiny.
Yet the growing use of dual class shares and staggered boards by new companies, measures that help founders retain control, argues against this need. And they are tools that can be used by any company -- even Shake Shack went public with dual-class stock.
The bottom line is that while there might be rational reasons to reduce regulation on capital raising -- to make it easier and less expensive -- we are kidding ourselves if we think that simply deregulating will bring back initial public offerings.
The task is much harder. The Securities and Exchange Commission, for one, could help build an infrastructure for buying small company offerings. Allowing mutual funds more latitude to buy illiquid small investments and to change their compensation structures if they do would be a big step.
In addition, we could explore more novel ways of bringing companies to the public markets. Special purpose acquisitions companies -- those created to buy a private company and bring it public -- have attracted criticism, including from me. Yet a recent $900 million deal in the energy business shows one possible way to take more companies public, provided there are investor protections.
Then there is the argument that maybe we shouldn't do anything, given how hard it will be. The idea behind the public markets is to provide capital funding. But if the private markets are now efficient and capable of providing even less expensive capital at lower cost, maybe we should be fine with the current state of affairs.
Still, that overlooks the fact that for most of us, our retirement money is in the public markets. We should be worried about all of this money flowing into a smaller and smaller group of companies.
One answer is to allow mutual funds to invest more in private companies. Already 26 mutual fund groups had $11.5 billion invested in late-stage companies in 2016, according to Credit Suisse.
That's one answer, but that will result in yet more intermediaries. The better solution is to push more companies to the public markets. Deregulating is one thing, but the real work will require more innovative thinking from market regulators. That's your homework, Mr. Clayton.

Full text: When it was created more than a half century ago, Medicaid almost escaped notice. Front-page stories hailed the bigger, more controversial part of the law that President Lyndon B. Johnson signed that July day in 1965 -- health insurance for elderly people, or Medicare, which the American Medical Association had bitterly denounced as socialized medicine. The New York Times did not even mention Medicaid, conceived as a small program to cover poor people's medical bills.
But over the past five decades, Medicaid has surpassed Medicare in the number of Americans it covers. It has grown gradually into a behemoth that provides for the medical needs of one in five Americans -- 74 million people -- starting for many in the womb, and for others, ending only when they go to their graves.
Medicaid, so central to the country's health care system, also played a major, though far less appreciated, role in last week's collapse of the Republican drive to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. While President Trump and others largely blamed the conservative Freedom Caucus for that failure, the objections of moderate Republicans to the deep cuts in Medicaid also helped doom the Republican bill.
"I was not willing to gamble with the care of my constituents with this huge unknown," said Representative Frank A. LoBiondo of New Jersey, a member of the centrist Tuesday Group caucus, noting that in three of the counties in his district in the state's more conservative southern half, over 30 percent of all residents are covered by Medicaid.
In the Senate, many Republicans, echoing their states' governors, had worried about jeopardizing the treatment of people addicted to opioids, depriving the working poor, children and people with disabilities of health care and in the long run reducing funding for the care of elderly people in nursing homes.
The Republican bill would have largely undone the expansion of Medicaid under the A.C.A., which added 11 million low-income adults to the program and guaranteed the federal government would cover almost all of their costs. It would have also ended the federal government's open-ended commitment to pay a significant share of states' Medicaid costs, no matter how much enrollment or spending rose. Instead, the bill would have given the states a choice between a fixed annual sum per recipient or a block grant, both of which would have almost certainly led to major cuts in coverage over time.
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office predicted that the Republican bill would have cumulatively cut projected spending on Medicaid by $839 billion and reduced the number of Medicaid beneficiaries by 14 million over the coming decade.
Many Republicans could not stomach those consequences. Even some conservatives -- Christopher H. Smith of New Jersey, for example, and Daniel Webster of Florida -- expressed concerns about the number of Medicaid recipients who could suffer.
The Trump administration will likely still seek to rewrite Medicaid rules and give states more leeway to limit benefits or eligibility, for example, allowing them to require certain adults in the program to have jobs or pay monthly premiums. And many Republican governors and members of Congress remain determined to curb Medicaid spending, including by methods proposed in the bill. In 2015, the nation spent more than $532 billion on Medicaid, of which about 63 percent was federal money and the rest from the states.
Still, last week's defeat reflected how hard it is to take away an entitlement. It also showed the broad and deep reach of Medicaid, which covers about six times as many people as the private marketplaces created under the A.C.A. but, perhaps because the markets are more strongly associated with President Barack Obama and his law, got less attention in this month's contentious debate.
Medicaid now provides medical care to four out of 10 American children. It covers the costs of nearly half of all births in the United States. It pays for the care for two-thirds of people in nursing homes. And it provides for 10 million children and adults with physical or mental disabilities. For states, it accounts for 60 percent of federal funding -- meaning that cuts hurt not only poor and middle-class families caring for their children with autism or dying parents, but also bond ratings.
The program is so woven into the nation's fabric that in 2015, almost two thirds of Americans in a poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation said they were either covered by Medicaid or had a family member or friend who was. The program not only pays for 16 percent of all personal health care spending nationwide, but also accounts for 9 percent of federal domestic spending.
Because it has always covered a patchwork of groups -- and many of its beneficiaries are poor and relatively powerless -- Medicaid lacks the unified, formidable political constituency that Social Security and Medicare have. States often have different names for the program, and many who rely on it don't realize that MassHealth in Massachusetts or TennCare in Tennessee are just Medicaid by another name.
But in Kaiser's polling since 2005, the percentage of people who support cutting Medicaid spending has never exceeded 13 percent. "The conventional wisdom that there's a great deal of stigma attached to this program does not bear out in the public opinion data," said Mollyann Brodie, who oversees polling for the foundation.
President Trump led the charge for the bill that would have slashed Medicaid, but he recognized the program's political potency during his campaign, proclaiming when he announced his candidacy that Medicaid should be saved "without cuts" and repeatedly taking to Twitter to declare his support for it. "The Republicans who want to cut SS and Medicaid are wrong," he wrote in July 2015.
The C.B.O. report made it clear that within a few years, the cuts to Medicaid in the Republican bill would have been felt by millions of Americans.
"It's health care for a huge chunk of the country," said James A. Morone, a political-science professor at Brown University, "and as Donald Trump discovered, it's really, really complicated to mess around with."
Facing Need Back Home
As he waited to see what would happen to the Republican proposal last week, Myrone Pickett said, "I've got a question mark hanging over my head."
Mr. Pickett, of Bloomfield, N.J., got health insurance under the A.C.A.'s expansion of Medicaid, and has used it for monthly shots of Vivitrol, a drug that reduces cravings for opioids and alcohol. A heroin addict for 16 years, Mr. Pickett, 51, said the treatment had helped him stay clean for the past year, get medication for bipolar disorder and land a job at a grocery store.
The A.C.A. offered a tempting deal to states that agreed to expand Medicaid eligibility to everyone with incomes up to 138 percent of the poverty level -- $16,400 for a single person -- mostly low-wage workers like cooks, hairdressers and cashiers. The federal government would initially pay 100 percent of the costs of covering their medical care, and never less than 90 percent under the terms of the law. Over the past three years, 31 states and the District of Columbia took the deal.
The move was especially helpful to states overwhelmed by the opioid epidemic. It required Medicaid to cover addiction and mental health treatment for those newly eligible.
Announcing his vote against the G.O.P. proposal last week, Representative Brian Fitzpatrick, a Pennsylvania Republican who represents a politically moderate district north of Philadelphia, said his top concern was "the impact on the single most important issue plaguing Bucks and Montgomery Counties, and the issue that I have made my priority in Congress: opioid abuse prevention, treatment and recovery."
The Republican bill would have allowed Medicaid payments to grow per person at an inflation rate that would have eroded their value over time. The C.B.O. estimated that states would have gradually had to devote more of their own money to Medicaid, cut payments to doctors, tighten eligibility or cut services covered.
In 2020, states would have started losing the 90 percent federal match for anyone who had gained Medicaid under the A.C.A. expansion but was dropped from the rolls, even briefly. And the bill required beneficiaries in the expansion population to re-enroll every six months, instead of annually, increasing the likelihood that many would be dropped.
As a result, the C.B.O. estimated that by 2026, less than 5 percent of Medicaid recipients enrolled under the A.C.A. would have been covered at the higher matching rate. But more broadly, the cuts would have almost inevitably affected every group covered by Medicaid, including the biggest block of recipients: 36 million children as of last year.
Representative Jaime Herrera Beutler, a Washington State Republican, announced her "no" vote on the bill Thursday, saying, "Protecting vulnerable children is a core purpose of the Medicaid program and when the program fails to do so, it fails entirely."
The cuts would also likely have eventually hit poor, chronically ill mothers like Tracie Scott of Paulding, Ohio. She has multiple sclerosis and quit her job at a dollar store two years ago because of it. Medicaid covers her and her four children, including her 2-week-old daughter and an 8-year-old son with brittle-bone disease who has needed expensive medication and care for frequent fractures.
"I'd be afraid to see some of the bills for my son," Ms. Scott, 30, said as she cradled her newborn, Izabella, in their hospital room recently. "It's been a lifesaver."
For more than six million Americans older than 64, Medicaid pays for nursing homes and other long-term care that they would never otherwise be able to afford, while Medicare covers their medical care.
The threat to such care propelled Representative Webster, whose Central Florida district includes The Villages, a retirement community with more than 150,000 residents, to lean "no" on the bill.
"This uniquely impacted Florida and our growing senior population that's only going to explode in years to come," said Jaryn Emhof, his spokeswoman.
Representative Smith of New Jersey said he was voting no because of concerns about the impact on people with disabilities, who make up just 15 percent of all Medicaid recipients but account for 42 percent of spending, making them particularly vulnerable to cuts.
For millions of disabled people, Medicaid covers services provided at home or through local programs -- aides who help them walk, eat and bathe, for example, and physical and speech therapy -- that allow them to stay out of institutions, where care is often more expensive. But those services are optional for states, while the cost of institutional care is not. The law would have given states an incentive to place them in institutions.
Medicaid pays for Barbara Theus, 67, to attend a day program in Southfield, Mich., so that her son and caregiver, Royale Theus, can work. Ms. Theus sustained a serious head injury in a car accident 11 years ago and has not been able to care for herself since then. Medicaid also pays for home health aides who help Ms. Theus, a former nurse who did not have much savings at the time of her accident, get showered and fed.
Mr. Theus was relieved when the bill failed. Had his mother lost coverage, he said, he would have had to leave his job to care for her. "I was hopeful that the powers that be would make the best decisions for the people, and that's what happened," he said.
The Battle Against Medicaid
This was the third major effort by Republicans to end Medicaid as an open-ended entitlement. The first was under President Ronald Reagan, the second was in 1995, after President Bill Clinton's unsuccessful attempt to expand health care coverage. But this was the first time Republicans tried it while they controlled the White House and both houses of Congress.
For all the battles over the years, Medicaid started as something of an afterthought.
By 1960, both parties were worried that the country's growing reliance on employer-based insurance was leaving out elderly people, who were unable to pay the rapidly rising cost of health care.
The night of President John F. Kennedy's assassination in November 1963, Lyndon Johnson returned to his home in Washington and, unable to sleep, summoned three aides. "That's when he took out his pen and wrote down the priorities that he was going to pursue," one of those aides, Bill Moyers, recalled in an interview. Among them was government health insurance.
President Harry S. Truman had sought to establish national health insurance -- and failed. Democrats decided to take on a more limited goal: insurance for elderly people. They called it Medicare. Democrats pushed for it to cover hospital bills for the elderly; Republicans wanted it to pay for private doctor's bills.
The American Medical Association had long lobbied against Medicare, hiring Reagan, then a Hollywood actor, to be the face of its campaign, producing a 1961 LP titled "Ronald Reagan Speaks Out Against Socialized Medicine."
And the doctors' group had an ally in Wilbur Mills, a conservative Democrat who was chairman of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee, who like the doctors' group did not think that well-off elderly people should have their bills covered. In 1960, Mr. Mills had co-sponsored a law that established a small program to help the states treat the needy, as a way to stave off proposals for Medicare. The doctors' group suggested expanding this program, preferring it because it would be administered by states, not the federal government.
Mr. Mills had a change of heart after Johnson's landslide victory in 1964. Johnson's Republican opponent, Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona, had denounced Medicare, and Mr. Mills, and many Republicans, were eager to distance themselves from him.
In early 1965, Mr. Mills proposed what became known as the three-layer cake: Medicare for hospital insurance, Medicare for doctor's bills and a broadened version of the law that helped states pay for the care of the poor, the program that would become Medicaid.
"Hardly anybody talked about Medicaid," said Paul Starr, a sociology professor at Princeton. "It just got added on."
At first, Medicaid helped states provide medical care only for single parents and children on welfare.
Over the next 25 years, Democrats -- sometimes working with Republicans -- gradually pushed to expand benefits -- to two-parent families, to children with speech and development delays, to home treatment for people who would otherwise be institutionalized, to children up to age 5, then to age 8 and later to age 18, and to pregnant women.
Ironically, some of the biggest expansions in Medicaid came in the 1980s under Reagan, the onetime A.M.A. mouthpiece.
After Republicans failed to turn Medicaid into a block grant, Democrats, who still controlled Congress, worked on compromises with the president and other Republicans, sometimes allowing cuts in programs like Medicare in exchange for expanding Medicaid, said former Representative Henry Waxman, a Democrat who shepherded many of those expansions.
Democrats carefully calibrated each expansion to fit within the annual budget, submitting plans to the Congressional Budget Office for "scoring," to see how much each would cost. "We couldn't do it all at once because we didn't have enough money in the budgets," Mr. Waxman said. But eventually, the goal to decouple Medicaid from the welfare system was achieved. "We broke the link to welfare," he said.
By the 1980s and '90s, health insurance was becoming prohibitively costly, and wages were starting to stagnate. Employer-based health insurance was eroding. States led by Republicans as well as Democrats began to expand their Medicaid programs.
"What people began to accept, including Republicans, was that the assumption that you could afford health insurance if you were an able-bodied adult was not true," said Colleen M. Grogan, a professor at the School of Social Service Administration at the University of Chicago, who has written extensively on health care. "You could be working and still not afford health insurance."
In 1996, Mr. Clinton expanded Medicaid to cover more working families as part of his welfare overhaul. Campaigning for re-election that year, he depicted Medicaid as a middle-class program, telling audiences it was helping their grandparents.
"He is the first Democrat to start calling Medicaid one of 'our programs,"' said Professor Morone of Brown. "There was a sense that Medicaid had sort of grown up as an entitlement."
The expansion of Medicaid in the Children's Health Insurance Program, passed with Republican sponsorship in 1997, set the stage for the sweeping expansions of the Affordable Care Act 13 years later.
But politics during Mr. Obama's presidency had become highly polarized. While earlier expansions of Medicaid had sometimes been bipartisan, the A.C.A. passed without a single Republican vote in Congress. The Tea Party had risen in opposition to the legislation, and later helped elect many of those who now form the conservative Freedom Caucus.
Gradually, though, Republican-led states have adopted the expansion. And now that the law known as Obamacare has survived the effort to repeal it, more states may choose to expand Medicaid. In Maine, voters will decide this fall whether to do so, and in Kansas, the Legislature has all but approved an expansion, although Gov. Sam Brownback could veto it.
Last week, despite their desire to repeal Mr. Obama's biggest domestic legacy, some Republicans recognized that any bill that would lead to such drastic cuts in Medicaid would simply hurt too many of their constituents.
In Ashland, Va., Medicaid made it possible for Kim Goodloe and her husband, Tom, to start a small company making metal parts for semiconductors and medical devices after the birth of twin boys with tuberous sclerosis 27 years ago. The genetic disorder causes tumors in vital organs, leading to frequent seizures, and Mrs. Goodloe had quit her job to take care of the boys when they were 4 -- Medicaid did not cover services for them back then. But now, Medicaid provides a home aide for Matthew, who is incontinent and nonverbal, suffers daily seizures and needs help walking.
For the other twin, Christopher, who is less severely developmentally disabled, Medicaid provided a job coach, helping him to work at their company and earn enough money that he now pays taxes.
The Goodloes have private insurance, but it is not required to pay for the twins' services, she said. With Virginia facing such steep cuts to its federal Medicaid payments, Mrs. Goodloe worried about losing the home health aide. They would have had to downsize the business, which employs 30 people.
"Even within my own family, when you say 'Medicaid' it comes with some, 'Those people don't want to work.' They believe there's a lot of fraud, there's people that don't deserve it."
"But then," she said, "They'll say, 'How could they take it away from Matthew?"'

Renegotiate Nafta? Mexico Says Get On With It

Full text: CORRECTION APPENDED. MEXICO CITY -- For more than two decades, free trade has been at the heart of Mexico's relationship with America, responsible for pumping a stream of vehicles, audio components and avocados north and cheap corn, cattle and software south.
To the nation's leaders, it was central, vital, nonnegotiable. At least until President Trump came along, promising to upend nearly $500 billion in annual trade between the two countries if it could not be re-engineered more in America's favor.
Now, the Mexico's leaders have a new priority: urging their American counterparts to hurry up and get on with it.
While free trade has long been an article of faith in Mexico, uncertainty over the fate of the North American Free Trade Agreement is hitting the country hard.
There has been an abrupt slowdown in foreign investment, pinching off much-needed capital as investors wait to see how things shake out. Last year, such investment fell by 6 percent, a prelude to what analysts have predicted will be a 21 percent drop in 2017. Add to that a fluttering peso, lowered growth expectations, rising interest rates and looming political headwinds, and the urgency becomes clear.
Mexico, and its investors, need certainty.
For the moment, the Americans are not giving it to them, and don't seem in a rush to do so. This month, Commerce Secretary Wilbur L. Ross said it would be later in the year before real talks even started -- after a mandatory 90-day consultation period with Congress, which has yet to start.
The delay has irked the Mexicans, who didn't want to renegotiate the pact in the first place.
"From the Trump and American perspective, this is purely an optional problem," said Michael Camuñez, the president of ManattJones Global Strategies and an assistant secretary of commerce in the Obama administration. "They have taken one of the most productive trade relationships in the world and amazingly have turned it into a problem."
Driving the pressure is an especially delicate political environment in Mexico. President Enrique Peña Nieto's approval ratings are near single digits, and further delays in clarifying the future of Nafta could imperil not only growth, but also employment at a time when the government can least afford to lose support.
Adding to the uncertainty are midterm elections in the State of Mexico, the country's most populous, from which the president hails. The state, a longtime center of power for Mr. Peña Nieto and his party, will hold elections on June 4, and it is far from clear that his party will win. A loss would be a devastating blow to the party, which has never lost there before, and would spell trouble in the 2018 presidential elections.
Which presents yet another paradox: The longer the Americans wait on Nafta negotiations, the more political pressure it places on Mr. Peña Nieto, reducing the flexibility he has to accommodate demands, or surprises, from Mr. Trump's team.
For instance, if job losses begin to mount within the next six months, as some economists predict, the public pressure on the president may be so immense he could have a much harder time selling a revised agreement to Congress and Mexicans at large.
"The longer we wait, the harder it is going to be for Trump to get what he wants because the nationalist pressure on Peña Nieto will be cumulative," said Pamela Starr, an associate professor of international relations at the University of Southern California. "The longer he is in the presidency, from today forward, the more of a lame duck he is."
All of this means that the leverage Mr. Trump is looking for could start to diminish.
Already, the Mexican government has grown more stridently critical of the Trump administration's stance on Nafta. The Mexican economic minister has said the nation will walk away from any deal that does not suit the country's needs, and even proffered a list of deal-breakers: any sort of discussion of paying for a border wall, taxing remittances or carrying out a so-called border adjustment tax.
At the same time, there is a growing awareness that dealing with Nafta, a campaign priority for Mr. Trump, has suddenly taken a back seat to more pressing battles. And Mexicans have taken note.
"It is clear that Trump's priority right now in terms of his agenda is to try to pass Trumpcare, and we know how long that takes," said Carlos Elizondo, a professor at the School of Government at the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education. "The outcome of that debate and process in the U.S. Congress will undoubtedly affect every other item on his list, including, of course, Nafta."
That could be a saving grace. Those reading the tea leaves of an eventual negotiation are hopeful that with Mr. Trump distracted, administration officials, including Mr. Ross, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson and others will take control of the talks. Both men have run global businesses in complex industries, and many here hope that will give them a more nuanced view of trade.
An evolving belief in the realm of business people, academics and even officials is that members of Mr. Trump's cabinet will understand the importance of Nafta, and move to preserve and expand it -- not tear it apart.
"When you know the kind of value chain that we have, you understand that it is a very difficult world to destroy, almost impossible," said Juan Pablo del Valle Perochena, the chief executive of Mexichem, a Mexican chemical and building materials manufacturer. "There is so much at stake, of course, more for Mexico than the U.S., but there is a lot of value already in place. And when people understand that, they don't worry so much."
Still, the uncertainty has had a clear impact on the Mexican economy. The peso dropped by double-digit percentages after Mr. Trump's election, forcing the central bank of Mexico to raise interest rates in February to an eight-year high to anchor inflation and bolster the currency, which has since rebounded.
Expecting further pressure from the tense relationship with the United States, economists from an array of institutions have revised downward the expected 2017 growth for Mexico. Bancomer, a Mexican bank, for instance, revised its growth expectations for the Mexican economy to 1.0 percent for the year.
Delays that might bleed into 2018 will place negotiations in the middle of a presidential election year in Mexico. Indeed, some analysts suggest that Mr. Peña Nieto could kick the decision to his successor if negotiations go on too long. That, according to some, could be disastrous for those hoping to preserve Nafta.
The leading candidate, for now, is Andrés Manuel López Obrador, a populist whose candidacy has been given a major boost by the election of Mr. Trump. Mr. López Obrador, a two-time candidate who nearly won the election in 2006, has promised to end a relationship of "subordination" to the United States, while focusing on domestic issues.
It is unlikely that Mr. López Obrador will take as conciliatory a line in negotiations as the current administration.
"The temptation to simply delay the negotiation until it becomes the next president's problem is real," Mr. Elizondo said.
Correction: March 28, 2017, Tuesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Sunday about Mexico's eagerness to see the North American Free Trade Agreement renegotiated referred incompletely to the current status of the peso. While the currency did in fact fall by double-digit percentages against the dollar after President Trump was elected, it rebounded in February and March and is now about 3 percent below its level of Nov. 8.

Full text: We've highlighted recent additions in blue, and drawn a line through the rule replaced. #1 States can apply for waivers to impose Medicaid work requirements make Medicaid recipients prove they are looking for work.
#2 States receive a flat per-beneficiary payment for Medicaid recipients have the option to take a lump sum for Medicaid to allocate as they wish.
#3 Every A.H.C.A. recipient gets a flat tax credit based on age -- except, possibly, Americans between 50 and 64.
#4 Obamacare taxes phase out in 2018 this year.
#5 Medicaid allotments for older and disabled beneficiaries would grow at faster than the rate of medical inflation.
#6 State politics in New York play no a small part in the Republicans' health care plan.
#7 If your tax credit was larger than your premium, you could save lose the difference.
LATE MONDAY, House Republicans unveiled a set of changes to the American Health Care Act, the plan they propose to replace Obamacare. Most of the changes will appeal to the party's right flank, including the Freedom Caucus, which has voiced concern that the bill does not go far enough to undo Obamacare. But there are also concessions to more moderate Republicans, many of them in the Senate. A vote is expected in the House on Thursday.
#1 Medicaid Work Requirements WHO'S HAPPY WITH THIS CHANGE Conservatives, particularly members of the Republican Study Committee, a conservative House group that met with President Trump last week Under Obamacare, Medicaid was available for Americans with low incomes whether they were employed or not. The Obama administration refused to allow work requirements, saying they were not consistent with the goals of Medicaid. Several Republican governors would like to give states the right to impose work requirements on Medicaid recipients who have no young children and are not old or disabled. The Republicans' proposal would allow states to decide for themselves between the two systems.
#2 Medicaid Block Grants WHO'S HAPPY Conservatives, particularly members of the Republican Study Committee The Republicans' initial plan would have changed the structure of the 52-year-old program, switching from a system in which the federal government paid a share of every medical bill to one in which states would receive a flat fee each year for each person signed up for the program. The amendment would give states a second option: Instead of that per capita payment, they could get a lump-sum payment for children and adults under 65 who don't have disabilities, along with more control over who can sign up and what benefits different kinds of Medicaid recipients could receive. This change will please conservatives in Congress, who hope to limit the growth of the program and increase state flexibility. Members of the Republican Study Committee and the House Freedom Caucus had asked for it. The amendment makes other changes to Medicaid: It would prevent any additional states from expanding the program to cover more poor, childless adults. It would take away extra funding from states that cover adults over a certain income threshold.
#3 Tax Credits WHO'S HAPPY Moderates, particularly those from rural districts Like Obamacare, the Republicans' proposal would help people who don't get insurance through work or the government buy their own coverage with tax credits. But the structure of the Republicans' tax credits is really different, handing them out on a flat basis according to age, for everyone earning up to around $75,000 a year. The bill would also allow insurers to charge older customers much higher prices than they can under Obamacare. The result: Older Americans with low incomes in high-cost areas would be hurt substantially. This is a group that tended to vote for President Trump. This reality worried some moderate G.O.P. politicians, particularly those from rural districts, where prices for health insurance are the highest. The amendment doesn't do anything to help that population in particular, but it adds a provision that would allow everyone to deduct more health care expenses from taxes. The change is intended as a placeholder, expected to cost about $85 billion over a decade, that could be turned by the Senate into targeted tax assistance for older insurance buyers, according to a Republican aide. What the Senate would do with the money is still unclear. But $85 billion would go only part of the way toward filling the gap between subsidies offered under this bill and the Affordable Care Act for older insurance shoppers.
#4 Obamacare Taxes WHO'S HAPPY Tax cutters The Democrats who wrote the Affordable Care Act helped pay the costs of expanding insurance coverage by imposing a variety of taxes. The Republican plan would eliminate taxes on health insurance, prescription drugs, tanning salons and investment income, among others. The original bill would have left the taxes in place until next year. The amendment would make them disappear faster. One tax that remains, a tax on expensive employer health plans, would be postponed until 2026. The original bill let it start in 2025.
#5 Medicaid Formula Changes WHO'S HAPPY Governors The per capita payments to states are set to grow under the legislation each year, according to the medical portion of the Consumer Price Index. But Medicaid costs for disabled patients and for those in nursing homes tend to be high and sometimes grow more quickly than that index. The change would give states a bigger annual increase for every beneficiary in either category.
#6 The 'Yankee Swap' WHO'S HAPPY A few upstate New York House members New York has among the highest per-enrollee Medicaid spending of any state, and some county governments pay for a share of the state's Medicaid expenses. County governments would like to have the state assume the full costs of that program. A revision, introduced by Representative Chris Collins of New York's 27th District, which includes a large part of rural western New York, would do just that, barring Medicaid funds from being used by small local governments under specific conditions tailored precisely to counties outside New York City. Those county governments don't like the current system because they have to pay their share out of property taxes. The change would instead require state government to pick up the bill. The result: Either the state will have to find more money, or Medicaid funding could be cut substantially. If this sounds like a weird parochial concern you might not expect in a piece of major federal policy legislation, that's because it is. But its inclusion signals congressional leaders' concerns about securing enough votes for passage. Some similar local policy giveaways were part of the Affordable Care Act.
#7 Health Savings Accounts WHO'S HAPPY Anti-abortion conservatives, deficit hawks Under the original bill, people whose insurance cost less than their tax credit could save the difference in a health savings account. But some anti-abortion activists were worried that system might allow federal dollars to be used to fund abortions. The provision also might save the federal government a little money, though there are probably few people who would be able to find insurance that costs less than the tax credits offered under the bill.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text: Two weeks after President Trump claimed, bizarrely, that the Obama administration had wiretapped his campaign, his press secretary suggested that GCHQ -- Britain's counterpart to the National Security Agency -- had done the imaginary bugging. British officials were outraged. And soon the British press was reporting that the Trump administration had apologized. But no: Meeting with the chancellor of Germany, another ally he's alienating, Mr. Trump insisted that there was nothing to apologize for. He said, "All we did was quote a certain very talented legal mind," a commentator on (of course) Fox News.
Was anyone surprised? This administration operates under the doctrine of Trumpal infallibility: Nothing the president says is wrong, whether it's his false claim that he won the popular vote or his assertion that the historically low murder rate is at a record high. No error is ever admitted. And there is never anything to apologize for.
O.K., at this point it's not news that the commander in chief of the world's most powerful military is a man you wouldn't trust to park your car or feed your cat. Thanks, Comey. But Mr. Trump's pathological inability to accept responsibility is just the culmination of a trend. American politics -- at least on one side of the aisle -- is suffering from an epidemic of infallibility, of powerful people who never, ever admit to making a mistake.
More than a decade ago I wrote that the Bush administration was suffering from a "mensch gap." (A mensch is an upstanding person who takes responsibility for his actions.) Nobody in that administration ever seemed willing to accept responsibility for policy failures, whether it was the bungled occupation of Iraq or the botched response to Hurricane Katrina.
Later, in the aftermath of the financial crisis, a similar inability to admit error was on display among many economic commentators.
Take, for example, the open letter a who's who of conservatives sent to Ben Bernanke in 2010, warning that his policies could lead to "currency debasement and inflation." They didn't. But four years later, when Bloomberg News contacted many of the letter's signatories, not one was willing to admit having been wrong.
By the way, press reports say that one of those signatories, Kevin Hassett -- co-author of the 1999 book "Dow 36,000" -- will be nominated as chairman of Mr. Trump's Council of Economic Advisers. Another, David Malpass -- the former chief economist at Bear Stearns, who declared on the eve of the financial crisis that "the economy is sturdy" -- has been nominated as undersecretary of the Treasury for international affairs. They should fit right in.
Just to be clear: Everyone makes mistakes. Some of these mistakes are in the "nobody could have known" category. But there's also the temptation to engage in motivated reasoning, to let our emotions get the better of our critical faculties -- and almost everyone succumbs to that temptation now and then (as I myself did on election night).
So nobody is perfect. The point, however, is to try to do better -- which means owning up to your mistakes and learning from them. Yet that is something that the people now ruling America never, ever do.
What happened to us? Some of it surely has to do with ideology: When you're committed to a fundamentally false narrative about government and the economy, as almost the whole Republican Party now is, facing up to facts becomes an act of political disloyalty. By contrast, members of the Obama administration, from the president on down, were in general far more willing to accept responsibility than their Bush-era predecessors.
But what's going on with Mr. Trump and his inner circle seems to have less to do with ideology than with fragile egos. To admit having been wrong about anything, they seem to imagine, would brand them as losers and make them look small.
In reality, of course, inability to engage in reflection and self-criticism is the mark of a tiny, shriveled soul -- but they're not big enough to see that.
But why did so many Americans vote for Mr. Trump, whose character flaws should have been obvious long before the election?
Catastrophic media failure and F.B.I. malfeasance played crucial roles. But my sense is that there's also something going on in our society: Many Americans no longer seem to understand what a leader is supposed to sound like, mistaking bombast and belligerence for real toughness.
Why? Is it celebrity culture? Is it working-class despair, channeled into a desire for people who spout easy slogans?
The truth is that I don't know. But we can at least hope that watching Mr. Trump in action will be a learning experience -- not for him, because he never learns anything, but for the body politic. And maybe, just maybe, we'll eventually put a responsible adult back in the White House.

Shares End Winning Week With Mixed Performance

Full text: Stocks limped to the finish line in another winning week, with indexes turning in a mixed performance on Friday. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slipped 3.13 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,378.25 on Friday. Gains after the Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday meant the index rose 0.2 percent for the week. It was the seventh weekly gain for the S.&P. 500 in the last eight weeks, and the index is within 1 percent of its high.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 19.93 points, or 0.1 percent, to 20,914.62. The Nasdaq composite index rose 0.24 points, or 0.004 percent, to 5,901.00.
The midweek rally occurred after the Fed gave a more measured forecast for interest-rate increases than some investors had expected. While announcing the rate increase of a quarter of a percentage point, the central bank said it was still planning a total of three increases this year. That surprised some investors, who had expected four increases, given the pickup in the economy and inflation. Not only did stocks rise after the announcement, but bond yields fell sharply.
The 10-year Treasury yield fell to 2.50 percent from 2.53 percent late Thursday. The two-year yield fell to 1.31 percent from 1.34 percent and the 30-year yield sank to 3.11 percent from 3.15 percent.
Financial stocks fell with bond yields. They have often moved together recently because higher rates let banks charge more for loans, raising profits. The sector fell 1.1 percent, the largest loss in the 11 sectors in the S.&P. 500.
Health care stocks were also weak. Amgen had the biggest loss in the S.&P. 500, down $11.50, or 6.5 percent, to $168.61, after results from a study of its cholesterol drug Repatha disappointed investors.
Dividend-paying stocks benefited from the fall in yields. When bonds pay less in interest, the income dividend-paying stocks provide is more attractive. Utility stocks in the S.&P. 500, which pay some of the biggest dividends in the index, rose 0.6 percent.
Adobe surged to one of the biggest gains in the index after reporting stronger revenue and earnings for its latest quarter than analysts had expected. It jumped $4.66, or 3.8 percent, to $127.01.
The jeweler Tiffany sparkled after it also reported an unexpectedly high profit. Strong demand in China and Japan helped offset flagging domestic sales. Its stock rose $2.44, or 2.7 percent, to $92.42.
In markets abroad, France's CAC 40 stock index rose 0.3 percent, and Germany's DAX and the FTSE 100 in London added 0.1 percent. Japan's Nikkei 225 fell 0.3 percent, South Korea's Kospi rose 0.7 percent and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong added 0.1 percent.
Finance leaders from the G-20 industrial and emerging economies are meeting through Saturday in Germany. The meeting, the first since President Trump was elected, is likely to focus on concerns over protectionism and currencies.
The euro edged down to $1.0743 from $1.0749 late Thursday, and the British pound rose to $1.2396 from $1.2358. The dollar slipped to 112.70 Japanese yen from 113.26 yen.
Benchmark crude rose 3 cents to settle at $48.78 a barrel. Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, rose 2 cents to $51.76 a barrel.
Gold rose $3.30 to $1,229.80 an ounce. Silver added 8 cents to $17.41 an ounce and copper rose 1 cent to $2.69 a pound.

Strategies for Holding On to This Year's Tax Refund

Full text: More than 70 percent of taxpayers are expected to get refunds this year, the Internal Revenue Service reports. That represents a big opportunity, according to savings advocates and financial advisers, since many Americans struggle to set aside cash for emergencies. Last year, the average refund was nearly $2,900 -- a significant amount of money for many people.
"For a lot of families, it's the biggest financial event of the year," said Timothy Flacke, executive director of Commonwealth, a nonprofit in Boston that promotes saving and financial security.
There is some indication that more people are focusing on saving at least part of their tax refund. In a Bankrate survey, more than a third said they would save or invest their refund this year, while just 6 percent said they would use it to splurge on a special treat, like a vacation or shopping spree. (The telephone survey, which polled 1,001 people in February, has a margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points.)
Millennials in particular were more likely to say they would save their refund, said Sarah Berger, a personal finance specialist at Bankrate. Perhaps, she said, because they have lived through a recession, they are aware of the need to save, in case of a job loss or illness.
Research from the Pew Charitable Trusts in 2015 found that 41 percent of households said they could not cover an unexpected expense of $2,000. And last year, the Federal Reserve reported that nearly half of American families would struggle to meet an emergency expense of even $400.
Saving is particularly challenging for families whose income fluctuates widely, new research from Pew finds.
"Families have very little liquid savings," said Erin Currier, director of Pew's financial security and mobility project.
Tax refunds can offer a chance for people to save, whether by establishing a rainy-day fund or setting up a retirement account, said Mr. Flacke of Commonwealth (which was formerly known as the D2D Fund). Getting a large chunk of your annual income as a lump sum "is a big deal," he said.
Acting before you have the cash in hand can help make sure you save some of the refund. One option, Mr. Flacke noted, is to receive your refund by direct deposit, and have the I.R.S. divide the money into separate accounts -- say, half to a savings account and half to your checking account.
Mr. Flacke also said consumers might consider buying savings bonds with their tax refunds. Tax time is the only remaining opportunity for people to purchase paper savings bonds; otherwise, consumers must buy digital savings bonds from the federal government.
One way to force yourself to save, said Robert Steen, a certified financial planner with USAA, is to get in the habit of talking with friends and family about your goal, whether in person or on social media.
"If you share it," he said, "it becomes more real."
Here are some questions and answers about using tax refunds to begin saving:
How can I split my tax refund?
To do this, file Form 8888 with your tax return. The form lets you divide the money among as many as three accounts.
Commonwealth and America Saves, a nonprofit that promotes saving, co-sponsor an annual "save your refund" promotion, which offers participants the chance to win multiple awards of $100, and a grand prize of $25,000, if they save part of their tax refund. You must split your refund using Form 8888 and save at least $50 to participate.
How do I buy savings bonds with my tax refund?
To buy savings bonds, you will also need to file Form 8888 and indicate that you want to purchase bonds with all or part of your refund. This year, taxpayers can use their refunds to buy up to $5,000 in I-series United States savings bonds, which pay a flat interest rate and an additional rate based on inflation. The bonds may be purchased in $50 increments.
What if my refund is very large?
Refunds can act as forced savings, but an outsize refund means that you have missed out on the chance to earn interest on that money. That was not such a big deal in recent years, because interest rates on insured savings accounts have been paltry. But with rates ticking upward, there are likely better places to keep your cash.
To reduce the amount of your refund, you will need to decrease the amount withheld from your paycheck. You can do this by filling out a revised W-4 form and giving it to your employer. The I.R.S. offers an online calculator to help you adjust the amount withheld.
Of course, if you know you lack discipline and might be tempted to spend the extra money from your paycheck, stick with the larger refund, said Ms. Berger of Bankrate.
"If you'll just spend it on things like takeout," she said, "maybe a refund is better for you."
