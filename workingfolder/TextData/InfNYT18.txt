Full text:   Jeb Bush wants to stop talking about past controversies. And you can see why. He has a lot to stop talking about. But let's not honor his wish. You can learn a lot by studying recent history, and you can learn even more by watching how politicians respond to that history.
The big "Let's move on" story of the past few days involved Mr. Bush's response when asked in an interview whether, knowing what he knows now, he would have supported the 2003 invasion of Iraq. He answered that yes, he would. No W.M.D.? No stability after all the lives and money expended? No problem.
Then he tried to walk it back. He "interpreted the question wrong," and isn't interested in engaging "hypotheticals." Anyway, "going back in time" is a "disservice" to those who served in the war.
Take a moment to savor the cowardice and vileness of that last remark. And, no, that's not hyperbole. Mr. Bush is trying to hide behind the troops, pretending that any criticism of political leaders -- especially, of course, his brother, the commander in chief -- is an attack on the courage and patriotism of those who paid the price for their superiors' mistakes. That's sinking very low, and it tells us a lot more about the candidate's character than any number of up-close-and-personal interviews.
Wait, there's more: Incredibly, Mr. Bush resorted to the old passive-voice dodge, admitting only that "mistakes were made." Indeed. By whom? Well, earlier this year Mr. Bush released a list of his chief advisers on foreign policy, and it was a who's-who of mistake-makers, people who played essential roles in the Iraq disaster and other debacles.
Seriously, consider that list, which includes such luminaries as Paul Wolfowitz, who insisted that we would be welcomed as liberators and that the war would cost almost nothing, and Michael Chertoff, who as director of the Department of Homeland Security during Hurricane Katrina was unaware of the thousands of people stranded at the New Orleans convention center without food and water.
In Bushworld, in other words, playing a central role in catastrophic policy failure doesn't disqualify you from future influence. If anything, a record of being disastrously wrong on national security issues seems to be a required credential.
Voters, even Republican primary voters, may not share that view, and the past few days have probably taken a toll on Mr. Bush's presidential prospects. In a way, however, that's unfair. Iraq is a special problem for the Bush family, which has a history both of never admitting mistakes and of sticking with loyal family retainers no matter how badly they perform. But refusal to learn from experience, combined with a version of political correctness in which you're only acceptable if you have been wrong about crucial issues, is pervasive in the modern Republican Party.
Take my usual focus, economic policy. If you look at the list of economists who appear to have significant influence on Republican leaders, including the likely presidential candidates, you find that nearly all of them agreed, back during the "Bush boom," that there was no housing bubble and the American economic future was bright; that nearly all of them predicted that the Federal Reserve's efforts to fight the economic crisis that developed when that nonexistent bubble popped would lead to severe inflation; and that nearly all of them predicted that Obamacare, which went fully into effect in 2014, would be a huge job-killer.
Given how badly these predictions turned out -- we had the biggest housing bust in history, inflation paranoia has been wrong for six years and counting, and 2014 delivered the best job growth since 1999 -- you might think that there would be some room in the G.O.P. for economists who didn't get everything wrong. But there isn't. Having been completely wrong about the economy, like having been completely wrong about Iraq, seems to be a required credential.
What's going on here? My best explanation is that we're witnessing the effects of extreme tribalism. On the modern right, everything is a political litmus test. Anyone who tried to think through the pros and cons of the Iraq war was, by definition, an enemy of President George W. Bush and probably hated America; anyone who questioned whether the Federal Reserve was really debasing the currency was surely an enemy of capitalism and freedom.
It doesn't matter that the skeptics have been proved right. Simply raising questions about the orthodoxies of the moment leads to excommunication, from which there is no coming back. So the only "experts" left standing are those who made all the approved mistakes. It's kind of a fraternity of failure: men and women united by a shared history of getting everything wrong, and refusing to admit it. Will they get the chance to add more chapters to their reign of error?

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Retail sales were flat in April as American households cut back on purchases of automobiles and other big-ticket items, indicating the economy was struggling to rebound after barely growing in the first quarter.
In addition to the weak retail sales report from the Commerce Department, other data on Wednesday showed April to be the 10th straight month of declining import prices, suggesting little urgency for the Federal Reserve to start raising interest rates.
"Hopes for a strong rebound are now fading. The likelihood of a near-term Fed action is almost zero now," said Thomas Costerg, an economist at Standard Chartered Bank in New York.
While March's retail sales were revised higher to show a 1.1 percent increase instead of the previously reported 0.9 percent rise, that was not enough to offset the general weak tone of the report. Economists had predicted sales would be up 0.2 percent in April.
Futures markets continued to show that traders do not expect an interest rate hike until December at the earliest. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies, while prices for U.S. Treasury debt slipped. U.S. stocks were little changed.
Retail sales excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services were also unchanged after an upwardly revised 0.5 percent increase in March.
These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. Economists had forecast core retail sales rising 0.5 percent in April after a previously reported 0.4 percent increase in March.
Retail sales have trended weaker even though households have benefited from lower gasoline prices. Consumers appear to have pocketed much of the savings, though.
The retail sales data added to employment and manufacturing reports in suggesting that while the economy was regaining its footing at the start of the second quarter, it lacked enough vigor to convince the Fed to tighten monetary policy soon.
The economy was walloped earlier in the year by a mix of bad weather, disruptions at ports, the strong dollar and deep spending cuts by energy firms. But many economists remain optimistic because personal savings are at two-year highs and consumer confidence remains robust.
"We remain puzzled by the softness in retail sales given the gains in employment, real incomes from lower energy prices, and wealth, but we continue to look for consumer spending to pick up this year," said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.
The weak retail sales trajectory was underscored by Macy's, one of the largest U.S. department store retailers, which reported a 13.8 percent drop in first-quarter net income. The company, which operates more than 850 stores throughout the United States and U.S. territories, said tourist spending at Macy's and Bloomingdale's stores were down sharply. It said second-quarter earnings were expected to fall short of the same period a year ago.
Several other major retailers will report results in the next few days, including Nordstrom, Kohl's and J. C. Penney, which will release its earnings after the close of trading Wednesday.
The government reported last month that G.D.P. expanded at a 0.2 percent annual pace in the first quarter.
Trade and wholesale inventory data published last week, however, suggested the economy actually contracted. That was corroborated by a third report from the Commerce Department on Wednesday, showing business inventories barely rose in March. Economists estimate the economy shrank at a 0.8 percent pace. The government will release its G.D.P. revision later this month.
The case for the Fed to delay hiking interest rates was strengthened by a separate report from the Labor Department showing import prices fell 0.3 percent in April after slipping 0.2 percent in March.
The dollar, which has gained about 11 percent against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners since June, and lower crude oil prices are keeping a lid on price pressures. That has left inflation running well below the Fed's 2 percent target.
"The dollar may have stabilized, but until it falls, the downward pressure emanating from lower import costs will limit domestic firm pricing power," said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisers in Holland, Pennsylvania.

Full text:   LONDON -- Joyce Ge, a student from China who is studying business management at King's College, pays 880 pounds a month, or $1,310, to live in a pint-size, stylish studio apartment in the far reaches of east London, in a building with roof decks gazing toward the distant city skyline. Her rent covers water and electricity, as well as Wi-Fi and cleaning of common spaces every two weeks.
Many investors are betting that there will be a lot more Joyce Ges arriving in the coming years.
Their bet is a simple one: As students from the world's growing middle and upper classes flock to London for higher education, the stark supply-demand imbalance in student housing will grow.
International college students are pouring into London, deepening an extensive housing shortage. The result is that student housing is becoming another red-hot corner of the city's property market. That has tempted international pension funds, major private equity players and real estate giants to build up or sell off large portfolios of buildings for handsome profits. The values of many of these portfolios are rising (and consequently, yields are falling) as a result of the intense investor interest.
About £3.5 billion worth of British student housing deals have been done so far in 2015, according to the real estate consulting firm JLL. That's more than double the value of deals completed in 2014.
"The volume has increased dramatically, and the values per bed have risen significantly," said Philip Hillman, the head of student housing and higher education at JLL.
Among the notable transactions are the Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board's £1.1 billion purchase of Liberty Living, previously owned by retail investors, and the Carlyle Group's sale of its Pure portfolio of student housing to LetterOne, a group of Russian investors, for £535 million.
Greystar Real Estate Partners, which is based in the United States, has completed seven deals, including buying Nido, a portfolio of student housing, for £600 million. (Blackstone sold that same portfolio to Round Hill Capital in 2012 for £415 million.)
"The pool of international buyers is expanding because the returns are attractive, the cash flows are attractive and there are platforms trading rather than individual assets," said Brett Lashley, a managing director at Greystar who is based in London.
Previously, universities provided housing to students, or students teamed up to rent a house together. The university housing was suitably shabby and "customer service was not a concept here," said one international investor.
But in the 1990s, the private sector jumped in to fill the gaping hole universities could not cover. Companies that developed properties and then managed them sprouted, and grew. Some took on too much debt.
During the financial crisis, private equity players like Blackstone and Carlyle stepped in to scoop up these properties, building up portfolios of student housing and creating the scale the market lacked to make it attractive for institutional investors.
Britain has 1.8 million full-time students, foreign and domestic combined. But to illustrate the shortage, only about 525,000 purpose-built student housing beds are available. These can be rooms to rent, a combination of what universities can offer and what the private sector leases -- either directly to students or via an agreement with the higher education institutions. About 220,000 of those beds are commercial properties, according to JLL.
Rents have been rising 3 percent to 4 percent a year with occupancy rates at 97 percent to 99 percent. Even after significantly steeper university fees were introduced in 2012, the market still grew. Intake for the 2014-15 school year hit a new peak, with 512,000 students matriculating.
Investors say growth is robust and nearly recession-proof. At the higher rent levels, many students are willing to pay whatever the cost.
"A lot of investors want to invest where the main driver is not the strength of the economy but more demographics," said Mr. Hillman of JLL, who has been involved in student housing for 25 years, giving him a window into how substantially the market has changed.
Crucial to growth in the sector, especially at the high end, where investors like Greystar are focusing, is the flood of international students. Of the 1.3 million students who were looking for a place to live in the 2013-14 school year, 72 percent were British, 7.5 percent were from the European Union and 20 percent were from other countries, according to the Higher Education Statistics Agency.
The five-year growth rate of international students has been 20.3 percent, compared with 8.3 percent for European Union students and only about a 1 percent increase for the domestic market. The government's Department of Business, Innovation & Skills predicted in 2013 that international students in higher education would rise 15 percent to 20 percent over the next five years. In 2013, the chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, said the government would eliminate the cap on the number of students a university could accept in 2015, also adding to the increase.
Universities are eager to attract foreign students because they pay more in fees. And student accommodation providers say they pay a lot more for their housing, too. Another appeal for investors is that the student populations move or graduate almost every year, allowing owners to increase rents.
"Rather than provide a room and a bed, we are providing a consumer experience," said James Pullan, head of student property at Knight Frank, another large London real estate group. "It's all about the international students."
Wi-Fi, in particular, is a major priority in amenities. "It's like having electricity," Mr. Lashley said.
British students are disquieted by the trend. "All the new builds are high-end and expensive and marketed to international students," said Colum McGuire, vice president for welfare for the National Union of Students. "Other students have to scrape to live in them." He knows: Though he grew up in London, he had to leave to attend college outside the city because of the cost of housing.
The National Union of Students measures affordability every few years. In its last survey, it found that the cost had more than doubled in the last decade. "That is in no way in correlation to the cost of living or inflation," Mr. McGuire said.
Those seeking to make money in this market, however, argue that they are bringing more choice and quality to the market.
"It's extremely positive to have high-quality investors putting their money in this sector," said Richard Simpson, head of property for the Unite Group, the largest provider of student accommodations in Britain. "It will drive standards up," he said, and create better housing stock. (Unite has "refreshed" all of its buildings in the last 12 months.)
As the demand for investments in student housing rises, yields are coming down. Yields have dropped sharply, to about 5 percent in central London from 6.25 percent a year ago.
But the sector of privately financed student housing has been marred by some well-publicized failures. Opal, a major student housing company, went bankrupt in 2013, and two other large student housing fund companies were forced to suspend redemptions when they could not sell property to meet the demands.
Yet the Opal bankruptcy proved to be a tipping point.
Greystar started to build scale, teaming up with Goldman Sachs to complete one £300 million deal. Investors from the United States, Russia and the Middle East started pouring in. British institutions, recently surveyed by JLL, want to increase their allocation to the sector. "It's a global asset class," Mr. Hillman said. "It's not a quirky British thing."
If Ms. Ge of King's College is any indication, the global investors may have to step up their game. She's moving from her tiny studio next year to her own apartment, even though she will still be a student. "It's too expensive for what you get," she said, as she loaded her laundry into smart-card-operated machines. "And there are too many rules."

Abstract: Nicholas Lardy, a China specialist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, said that while indicators like electricity generation, rail freight car loadings and industrial production had slowed, growth in the service sector had at least partly offset difficulties in manufacturing and in investment-led sectors like construction.

Full text:   SHANGHAI -- Hoping to shore up a weakening economy, China said on Sunday that it would cut benchmark interest rates for the third time in five months.
The nation's central bank said in its announcement that the one-year lending rate would be reduced by 25 basis points, or a quarter of a percentage point, to 5.1 percent, and that the one-year deposit rate was also being cut 25 basis points, to 2.25 percent.
The government announced weaker-than-expected trade figures on Friday, with exports dropping 6.4 percent in April compared with a year earlier, and with persistent signs of weakness in other parts of the economy. On Saturday, the government reported tepid consumer inflation, which ran at a rate of 1.5 percent in April.
By reducing interest rates, the government hopes to spur lending to businesses and create more momentum for the economy, the world's second-largest after the United States.
Although China is still growing faster than any other major economy, the slowdown has worsened in recent months.
China reported last month, for instance, that its economy grew just 7 percent in the first quarter of this year, one of the lowest rates in a decade and far below the double-digit growth the country had become accustomed to over the past few decades.
This year, the government has targeted growth of about 7 percent, but policy makers are concerned that the pace is falling too rapidly and that growth much lower than 7 percent could create huge disruptions in the economy.
While China's stock market has suddenly come to life, the property market has been weak, exports have fallen and there are worries about the huge debt that has built up over the past decade, particularly from local government borrowing for infrastructure.
The authorities have said they are comfortable with a lower, more sustainable rate of growth and have pushed to restructure the economy in favor of more household consumption and away from state-owned companies. And as part of that strategy, some officials have insisted that the government will not fund a stimulus package, the way it did in late 2008 and 2009, after the onset of the global financial crisis.
Many economists, but not all, are gloomy about China's prospects in the coming years. Nicholas Lardy, a China specialist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, said that while indicators like electricity generation, rail freight car loadings and industrial production had slowed, growth in the service sector had at least partly offset difficulties in manufacturing and in investment-led sectors like construction.
"The traditional relationship between electric power generation and G.D.P. growth has changed," he said in an interview in Washington in late April, referring to gross domestic product.
Fred Hu, a Hong Kong economist and financier who is an informal economic adviser to the Chinese government, also contends that the Chinese economy's weaknesses are sometimes exaggerated, and that growth might not slip much below the government's target of about 7 percent. "It may fluctuate, but 7 percent is about the right number," he said.
But an ever-growing body of downbeat economic statistics has prompted other economists to worry that Chinese policy makers now face an unappetizing choice. They can continue to cut interest rates and bank reserve requirements in a bid to stimulate bank lending and keep the economy growing fairly strongly. But that extra lending would only expand further a debt load, particularly at local governments and state-owned enterprises, that has been surging as a share of economic output ever since the global financial crisis in 2008 and 2009.
Friday's trade figures showed that exports unexpectedly dropped 6.4 percent in April from the same month last year; they had been expected to show a slight increase. Some economists said the drop was partly the result of the declining attractiveness, as the Chinese renminbi gradually weakened against the dollar, of overstating exports to Hong Kong so as to evade currency controls and speculate on exchange rate movements. Other economists said the weakness in exports showed that China's fundamental competitiveness had weakened as a result of surging labor costs and a rise in the renminbi's value over the preceding decade.
China's imports also plunged 16.2 percent in April from a year earlier, a fall that economists attributed partly to low commodity prices and partly to weak demand within China's economy.

Full text:   MOSCOW -- President Vladimir V. Putin used a visit on Sunday by the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, to call for a return to normal relations with Europe, brushing aside the widespread boycott by Western leaders of the huge Victory Day parade on Red Square a day earlier.
"We do face some problems today, but the sooner we can end their negative impact on our relations, the better it will be," Mr. Putin told Ms. Merkel at the start of their talks, after both leaders laid large bouquets of red flowers on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier along the Kremlin wall.
Ms. Merkel and other Western leaders avoided the colossal official outpouring marking the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II. The parade included 16,000 soldiers marching through Red Square, along with the first new Russian tank in decades, the T-14 Armata, and three updated Yars intercontinental ballistic missiles. (An Armata stalled in the square during a practice run on Thursday, but all went smoothly during the real event.)
The guests of honor were Presidents Xi Jinping of China and Pranab Mukherjee of India. Their nations were among 10 countries with military contingents in the parade. Most of the others were former Soviet states. The presidents of Egypt, South Africa, Cuba and Venezuela were also among those attending.
Western leaders declined to take part because of the seizure by Russian forces of Crimea from Ukraine last year, which touched off a diplomatic crisis and led to sanctions. Of some 68 leaders invited, only 27 attended, with virtually every Western country represented by its ambassador at the event, the biggest military parade ever staged on Red Square. Wave after wave of Russian soldiers marched past for more than 30 minutes.
Yet Ms. Merkel said she felt obliged to mark the end of the war against Nazi Germany during which the Soviet Union lost more than 26 million people, far more than any other country. "It is important for me to pay tribute to the fallen soldiers," Ms. Merkel said at a news conference. "We will always tell the Russian nation that we will remember the losses and the atrocities."
Mr. Putin sought to use Ms. Merkel's visit, as well as that of the other world leaders, to underscore that the Ukraine crisis had not left Russia isolated.
"Everyone we wanted to see was here," he said at one point when asked on television about the boycott.
In his speech during the parade, Mr. Putin thanked the Western nations for the wartime alliance, saying, "We are grateful to the peoples of Great Britain, France and the United States of America for their contribution to the victory."
He also obliquely castigated the United States, as he often does: "We saw attempts to establish a unipolar world," he said. "We see the strong-arm bloc thinking, gaining momentum. All that undermines sustainable global development."
On Sunday, Mr. Putin emphasized reconciliation. At the news conference after he and Ms. Merkel had met for a couple of hours, he emphasized that about 6,000 German businesses operated in Russia and that they would like to see the "obstacles removed" from trade.
For her part, Ms. Merkel made the kind of critical statement about the Ukraine conflict rarely heard in Moscow these days and one that made it clear that Germany, at least, was not quite ready for business as usual. "We have sought more and more cooperation in recent years," Ms. Merkel said about German-Russian relations. "The criminal and illegal annexation of Crimea and the war in eastern Ukraine have led to a serious setback to this cooperation."
Both leaders expressed new support for the cease-fire agreement agreed upon in Minsk, Belarus, in February, although both suggested that the implementation was flawed.
Mr. Putin asserted that Kiev needed to enter a dialogue with the separatist areas of Donbas and Luhansk to work out their future relations, while Ms. Merkel noted that a complete cease-fire had not been achieved.
Diplomats said that behind the scenes senior Russian officials had been emphasizing the idea that the Ukrainian issue was basically a domestic dispute that Moscow and the European Union must shepherd toward a solution, while they themselves should concentrate on broader, more important issues.
Mr. Putin evidently hopes that differences among European Union nations might prevent an extension of financial, defense and energy sanctions at a European summit in June.
"He thinks that he can wait for a while until business as usual comes back," said Nikolai Petrov, an independent political analyst. "He is waiting for them to maintain the rhetoric but make life easier in the banking and financial sector."
Mr. Putin is feeling slightly more confident, analysts said, because the economic picture is not as bleak as it seemed a couple months ago despite still serious problems.
Russia has been aided by a rise in oil prices, and the ruble has stabilized at about 50 to the dollar -- far higher than the roughly 34 rubles to the dollar last spring, but far less than at its most volatile five months ago.
The prime minister, Dmitri A. Medvedev, has said gross domestic product declined by about 2 percent in the first quarter of this year. It is somewhat less than anticipated, although the World Bank has said that it will contract by 3.8 percent for the year. Inflation was nearly 17 percent in March, the World Bank said.
"The main goal for Putin now is to attain not the cancellation of Western sanctions, but weakening sanctions," said Kirill Rogov, an economic analyst. "I think he will use the combination of threats and peaceful statements to compel Western leaders to weaken restrictions in the financial sphere."
Mr. Putin received support from some of his guests, including the longtime president of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, 91. "You are fighting sanctions, like we are. It's the reason why we should be together," Mr. Mugabe said during a meeting Sunday.
Perhaps the biggest outpouring of support for the Russian government came from the estimated 500,000 people who turned out to march through Red Square for the "Immortal Regiment" parade on Saturday afternoon. Most carried pictures of their parents or grandparents who fought in the war.
Mr. Putin joined the march in Moscow carrying a picture of his father. Ironically for a government that has crushed all public demonstrations, this march was begun four years ago by an independent television station that has since been forced out of business.
The mood among ordinary Russians was either perplexed that Western leaders stayed away or defiance that Russia could go it alone. Russians have long felt that despite the differences between the Soviet Union and the West, marking the victory over Germany was the one time that they could set aside any differences.
One veteran, Stanislav Prokofievich, 86, leaning heavily on a cane, said he was part of the parade a decade ago when President George W. Bush attended. "Bush was sitting in the front row with the president. Why isn't Obama here today?" Mr. Prokofievich said. "What happened? What is his problem?"
Fyodor Lukyanov, a political analyst who was out among the crowds on Saturday, said he noted a kind of good riddance mood toward the Western leaders.
"Many people were asking why did we invite them, it is our celebration and our victory, so why pay so much attention to who came and who did not," he said, with some people noting that in Soviet times foreigners were not invited. "We are back to this tradition, back to the Soviet tradition."

Full text:   More than two decades ago, Bill Bengen, then a financial planner in Southern California, said he had several anxious clients with the same question: How much can I spend in retirement without running out of money?
Being relatively new to the profession, he dived back into his finance textbooks for answers, but said he couldn't find any guidelines rooted in facts. "I decided to get down to business with my computer," said Mr. Bengen, 67, who retired in 2013 and now lives with his wife in La Quinta, a resort town in California's Coachella Valley.
What he and his computer produced, in 1994, became part of the financial vernacular and is still the most widely referenced rule of thumb. Known as the 4 percent rule, it found that retirees who withdrew 4 percent of their initial retirement portfolio balance, and then adjusted that dollar amount for inflation each year thereafter, would have created a paycheck that lasted for 30 years.
The concept has been both celebrated and criticized, and it has recently come under scrutiny yet again, particularly as the current crop of retirees are entering retirement during a period of historically low interest rates. But the question of how much they can safely spend each year may be more important than ever: Roughly 11,000 people, on average, are expected to turn 65 every day for the next 15 years, according to the Social Security Administration.
"I always warned people that the 4 percent rule is not a law of nature like Newton's laws of motion," said Mr. Bengen, who graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with a bachelor's in aeronautics and astronautics in 1969. "It is entirely possible that at some time in the future there could be a worse case."
Mr. Bengen's original analysis assumed the retirees' portfolio was evenly split between stocks and bonds, and he tested whether the paycheck could persevere through every 30-year period dating from 1926. It succeeded.
The big question now -- difficult even for an aerospace engineer to answer -- is whether a new worst case is beginning to play out, given the painfully low interest rate environment, which yields little for safer bond investments, where retirees often hold a big portion of their money.
"Because interest rates are so low now, while stock markets are also very highly valued, we are in uncharted waters in terms of the conditions at the start of retirement and knowing whether the 4 percent rule can work in those cases," said Wade Pfau, a professor of retirement income at the American College of Financial Services and another researcher within the financial planning community.
Since Mr. Bengen's original paper was published, the 4 percent concept has been replicated, expanded, criticized and even refined by Mr. Bengen himself. (By using a more diversified portfolio, he later raised the rate to 4.5 percent.)
Critics of the rule point out that it is based on conditions in the United States during a very specific time in history; it also doesn't take into account items like investments costs, taxes, different time horizons or the reality that most retirees don't spend their money in a linear fashion. Some people may want to spend more early in retirement and may be willing, even comfortable, making cuts when the market plunges once again. And if retirees want to leave money to their children, they may need to trim their spending further.
Sorting all of this out, particularly without a cushy pension to fall back on, is a complicated task, even for a numbers-savvy retiree. Still, the original 4 percent rule persists as a starting point, and some retirement experts are still comfortable suggesting similar withdrawal rates, with some caveats and new twists of their own.
In a recent analysis, Mr. Pfau compared several withdrawal strategies in an attempt to illustrate how spending patterns might change to guarantee that a portfolio will last for 30 years, even if low rates persist or retires face some other awful combination of events.
He found that people who spend a constant amount adjusted for inflation -- similar to the 4 percent rule -- would have to reduce that rate to 2.85 to 3 percent if they wanted assurance that their spending would never have to dip below 1.5 percent of their initial portfolio (in inflation-adjusted terms).
So a retiree with $1 million could securely spend nearly $30,000 annually for 30 years, in the best and worst of market conditions. The big drawback, though, is that if economic conditions are generally average, retirees would be left with $794,000 in unspent money. If they were unlucky and experienced terrible market conditions, they would be left with $17,900.
That's the trouble with this strategy. "Most of the time, you underspend," said Mr. Pfau, who is also a principal at McLean Asset Management. "Yet you still run the risk of running out."
Other retirement experts, including Michael Kitces, director of research at the Pinnacle Advisory Group, are still comfortable recommending early withdrawal rates of about 4 percent. He has likened the current environment -- low interest rates and high stock market valuations -- to walking along a cliff. Today's retirees are walking along the edge, which, he said in his blog, required more caution and continuous monitoring. But that doesn't mean they're going to fall off.
"The 4 percent rule was built around some rather horrific bear markets of the past already," he said. "Do we necessarily know or expect that the next one will be so much worse than any of the other terrible historical bear markets we've seen?"
Mr. Pfau isn't so sure. So his recent study looked at different strategies beyond the 4 percent rule, some of which allow people to spend a bit more early on, but also provided assurances that spending wouldn't dip below a certain level for 30 years. At least one approach that he analyzed, using a portfolio evenly split between stocks and bonds, was initially created by Jonathan Guyton, a financial planner with Cornerstone Wealth Advisors in Edina, Minn., and allows an initial withdrawal rate that approaches 5 percent.
To start that high, however, you need to follow a complicated set of rules: Normally, annual withdrawal amounts can increase by last year's rate of inflation. And in good years, retirees can generally increase withdrawals by 10 percent.
But no increase is permitted in years when the portfolio loses money. In fact, a small spending cut might be necessary in that case: When balances drop below certain levels -- causing your withdrawal rate to rise more than 20 percent above the initial rate, say to 6.4 percent from 5.3 percent -- the next year's withdrawal must be cut by 10 percent.
Tricky rules of that sort are likely to leave retirees scratching their heads. It's hard envisioning even the sharpest of aging retirees, much less the most vulnerable, following this sort of discipline on their own.
So perhaps it's not all that surprising that Mr. Bengen said he had hired not one, but two financial advisers -- both good friends -- to handle his retirement money. Though his advisers rely on financial software, he said they were proponents of the 4 percent rule.
"And my actual numbers probably come close to that," said Mr. Bengen, who spends his days honing his creative writing, playing the guitar, setting up bridge and boating clubs and taking time to visit his 20-month-old grandson. "I have followed my own advice."
But if he had advice to offer others, it is this: "Go to a qualified adviser and sit down and pay for that," he said. "You are planning for a long period of time. If you make an error early in the process, you may not recover. "

Abstract: [...]any lingering possibility of a June rate hike from the Fed is now off the table, with September probably the most likely liftoff date now," said Paul Ashworth, chief United States economist for Capital Economics, a research firm.

Full text:   The American job market rebounded in April, the government said on Friday, easing fears that the economy was on the brink of another extended slowdown after a bleak winter stall. But the growth in jobs failed to translate, once again, into any significant improvement in pay.
Employers added 223,000 positions last month, the Labor Department reported, and the unemployment rate decreased to 5.4 percent, a turnaround from the disappointing performance in March, initially reported as a modest 126,000 gain and then revised down on Friday to 85,000.
"We expected a rebound following the numbers in March and we got it, but not much more," said Guy Berger, United States economist at RBS. "Wage growth is still the missing piece."
Even though payrolls have risen at a healthy pace recently -- averaging gains of 243,000 positions per month since the beginning of 2014 -- the prospect of a real raise for most workers has taken on a "Waiting for Godot"-like quality.
As the unemployment rate has dropped, many economists have kept predicting that substantive pay increases would come soon. But as long as wage gains remain just around the corner, their absence is expected to fuel increased public frustration and become a central issue in the presidential campaign.
Before Friday's report, some economists were estimating that average hourly earnings might rise 0.2 percent or more in April, signaling an upswing from the slow pace of wage gains since the end of the recession.
But average hourly earnings rose only 0.1 percent in April, producing a 2.2 percent annual gain. That modest showing suggested that any meaningful wage gains for most workers were still delayed, despite the steadily falling unemployment rate.
Conservative critics of President Obama's economic policies cite stagnant wages as evidence of how weak the economy remains, despite other seemingly rosy data points like the falling unemployment rate, healthy corporate profits and a buoyant stock market.
But the course of the economy over coming months will be shaped largely by the Federal Reserve, and the lack of wage pressure means the central bank will not be in a rush to take its long-awaited first step in raising short-term interest rates, which have been near zero since late 2008.
Many experts once expected the Fed to move in June, but the consensus has recently shifted to September or beyond as the probable beginning of any gradual tightening effort by the central bank.
"All things considered, any lingering possibility of a June rate hike from the Fed is now off the table, with September probably the most likely liftoff date now," said Paul Ashworth, chief United States economist for Capital Economics, a research firm.
Mr. Berger agreed that if monthly job gains could be sustained at this pace, the Fed would probably act at its September meeting.
If the coming months bring similarly strong numbers, "the Fed will probably feel comfortable raising rates in September," Mr. Berger said. "Wage growth isn't a precondition to raising rates, but they want some confidence that it is on the way."
The prospect of steady hiring without the risk of inflation brought by rising wages, leaving the Fed in a wait-and-see mode, is welcome on Wall Street, even if it's a cause for concern among voters and politicians. In trading on Friday, major market indexes were up nearly 1.5 percent, while 10-year bond yields eased slightly.
Underscoring the uncertain picture, the government said in a separate report on Friday that wholesale inventories rose more slowly than expected in March. With businesses restocking shelves less aggressively, experts at Barclays and Macroeconomic Advisers revised their estimate for economic activity in the first quarter downward on Friday to show a contraction of 0.6 percent, even worse than the Commerce Department's initial estimate of a tiny 0.2 increase.
Adding to the mystery of missing wage growth is the fact that the composition of new jobs has improved markedly lately, a reversal of what was the case early in the recovery. In April, higher-wage sectors like professional and business services and construction were big winners. Relatively low-paid categories like retailing and leisure and hospitality were much less robust.
One notable loser in April was the energy industry, which has been stung by the sharp decline in oil prices since last summer. Energy prices have ticked higher recently, as have gasoline costs, but energy companies continued to shed workers, cutting more than 10,000 jobs in April.
At 5.4 percent, the headline unemployment rate is down sharply from nearly 8 percent two years ago and experts say it could fall below 5 percent by the end of the year if hiring continues to gain steam. But the broadest measure of unemployment, which includes people forced to take part-time positions because they cannot find full-time work, remains high for nonrecessionary times at 10.8 percent.
At the same time, millions of workers have given up the search for jobs entirely and dropped out of the work force. Although it ticked higher to 62.8 percent last month, the labor participation rate has been stuck for years near multi-decade lows.
For Fed policy makers, the central question is whether most of those missing workers have disappeared because of longer-term demographic forces like the retirement of the baby boomers or whether many are still waiting in the wings and will return to the job market as employers reach beyond the pool of the existing work force. Before letting interest rates rise to a level in line with historical norms, the policy makers want to see evidence that the labor market slack that built up during the recession and a long but fitful recovery is finally receding.
While it would certainly be good economic news if more of those discouraged workers returned to the labor force and landed jobs, one possible consequence would be a continuation of slow wage growth, said Tara M. Sinclair, chief economist for Indeed.com, a leading job search engine.
"There's still slack," she said, noting that unless employers are forced to compete for candidates to fill jobs, they face little pressure to substantially increase salaries.
In Washington, even officials who hailed the sizable jump in payrolls acknowledged that until paychecks really start to grow, it won't feel much like a recovery.
"The difference between where we are now and where we were in the 1990s is that the prosperity then lifted more boats," said Labor Secretary Thomas E. Perez. "The unfinished business of the recovery is wage growth. Too many people are working a 50-hour workweek and getting their food at a food pantry."

Full text:   Stocks fell across industries on Wednesday as investors appeared to fret about a number of things: stock valuations, economic growth and rising interest rates.
Markets started the day higher, propelled by a jump in energy stocks, but then quickly gave up the gains. A comment by the chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, Janet L. Yellen, suggesting that stocks were generally overvalued added to the selling pressure.
Uncertainty over how quickly interest rates will climb also weighed on markets as yields on bonds continued to rise. Some market experts say they think the Fed will have to increase its short-term rate relatively soon to fight inflation. The yield on the 10-year United States Treasury note rose to 2.25 percent, its highest level in two months.
"There are creeping worries that inflation, which was seen as nonexistent, will soon be part of landscape," said Mark D. Luschini, chief investment strategist for Janney Montgomery Scott. "There is data suggesting the Federal Reserve will not be in a hurry to raise rates, but people are worried."
Eight of the 10 industry sectors of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index ended the day lower, led by a 1.2 percent slump in telecommunications companies.
The S.&P. 500 fell 9.31 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,080.15. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 86.22 points, or 0.5 percent, to 17,841.98. The Nasdaq declined 19.68 points, or 0.4 percent, to 4,919.64.
In economic news, the American payroll processor ADP said hiring slowed in April to its weakest pace in nearly a year and a half. But a separate report showed that labor costs jumped 5 percent in the first quarter, after a 4.2 percent rise in the fourth quarter.
"I think we're going to get higher rates, and the stock market is going to struggle with this," said Jim Paulsen, chief strategist at Wells Capital Management, noting that the unemployment rate fell to 5.5 percent in March, down nearly half from its peak less than six years ago. "It doesn't take much to overheat when you're near full employment."
Investors will get a clearer picture on Friday, when the government releases its monthly survey on hiring and unemployment.
The decline in stocks accelerated in midmorning trading after Ms. Yellen said market valuations were generally "quite high" in response to a question about risks to financial stability at a conference in Washington.
Corporate earnings reports were mixed. Electronic Arts, a maker of video games, rose 3 percent, and Lending Club rose 4 percent after reporting results that beat analysts' expectations. EA rose $1.77, to $60.93, and Lending Club rose 73 cents, to $18.31.
News Corporation, the publisher of The Wall Street Journal, fell $1.03, or 6.4 percent, to $14.99 after its results missed forecasts. The restaurant chain Noodles & Company also reported disappointing results, and investors sent its stock down $4.01, or 19 percent, to $16.70.
In deal news, shares of Synageva BioPharma soared 112 percent after Alexion Pharmaceuticals said it would pay a huge premium to buy the maker of rare-disease treatments in an $8.4 billion deal. Synageva has no products on the market and lost nearly $60 million in the first quarter. Its stock rose $107.52, to $203.39.
Crude climbed above $60 a barrel for the first time this year on Tuesday after reports that a Libyan oil terminal had closed.
The price of oil also rose on an unexpected drop in crude oil supplies. Benchmark United States crude rose 53 cents to close at $60.93 a barrel in New York after having reached as high as $62.58 during the day. Brent crude rose 25 cents to close at $67.77 in London.
In other futures trading on the Nymex, wholesale gasoline fell 2.6 cents to close at $2.037 a gallon; heating oil rose 0.1 cent to close at $2.016 a gallon; and natural gas fell 0.4 cents to close at $2.776 per 1,000 cubic feet.
Gold fell $2.90 to $1,190.30 an ounce, silver fell 7 cents to $16.50 an ounce and copper fell a penny to $2.93 a pound.

Abstract: [...]by increasing consumer spending and creating jobs, it helps the economy. Studies have shown that every dollar increase for a minimum-wage worker results in $2,800 in new consumer spending by household, and of the 13 states that have increased the minimum wage since 2014, including New York, all but one experienced employment growth.

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDED. ALBANY -- INCOME inequality is a national problem that leaders at all levels of government are grappling with. While American capitalism never guaranteed success, it did once guarantee opportunity. But today, too many Americans don't believe their children will have a better life than their own. The ideal of mobility has been replaced by the reality of stagnation.
Some argue that we can close the income gap by pulling down the top. I believe we should do it by lifting up the bottom. We can begin by raising labor standards, starting with the minimum wage.
In 2013, I raised New York State's minimum wage; it is now $8.75, up from $7.25 (and will rise to $9 at the end of the year). In my latest budget, I proposed raising it again, to $11.50 in New York City and $10.50 elsewhere in the state. But the Legislature rejected that proposal. So I am continuing the fight. While lawmakers delay, I am taking action.
State law empowers the labor commissioner to investigate whether wages paid in a specific industry or job classification are sufficient to provide for the life and health of those workers -- and, if not, to impanel a Wage Board to recommend what adequate wages should be.
On Thursday, I am directing the commissioner to impanel such a board, to examine the minimum wage in the fast-food industry. The board will return in about three months with its recommendations, which do not require legislative approval.
President Franklin D. Roosevelt made the minimum wage a national law in 1938. Years earlier, he said, "By living wages, I mean more than a bare subsistence level -- I mean the wages of a decent living." But minimum wages have not kept pace with the rising cost of living.
Nowhere is the income gap more extreme and obnoxious than in the fast-food industry. Fast-food C.E.O.s are among the highest-paid corporate executives. The average fast-food C.E.O. made $23.8 million in 2013, more than quadruple the average from 2000 (adjusting for inflation). Meanwhile, entry-level food-service workers in New York State earn, on average, $16,920 per year, which at a 40-hour week amounts to $8.50 an hour. Nationally, wages for fast-food workers have increased 0.3 percent since 2000 (again, adjusting for inflation).
Many assume that fast-food workers are mostly teenagers who want to earn extra spending money. On the contrary, 73 percent are women, 70 percent are over the age of 20, more than two-thirds are the primary wage earners in their family, and 26 percent are raising a child.
Fast-food workers and their families are twice as likely to receive public assistance compared with other working families. Among fast-food workers nationwide, 52 percent -- a rate higher than in any other industry -- have at least one family member on welfare.
New York State ranks first in public assistance spending per fast-food worker, $6,800 a year. That's a $700 million annual cost to taxpayers.
While workers in the fast-food industry are struggling, the industry is healthy, having taken in $551 billion in global revenues last year, a sum that is projected to grow to $645 billion by 2018. McDonald's brought in $4.67 billion last year; Burger King earned $291.1 million. The government is subsidizing these corporations, allowing them to keep their labor costs low and their profit margins high.
Industry leaders have argued that raising wages for fast-food workers would drive up the prices of burgers and fries beyond what many customers, themselves of modest means, can afford. But that hasn't been the experience in other countries. Australia set the minimum wage for adult fast-food workers at $16 an hour, but a Big Mac there costs only $4.32 on average, compared with $4.79 in the United States, according to The Economist's Big Mac Index. France, where the minimum wage is over $12, has more than 1,200 McDonald's.
More than 600 economists, including seven Nobel Prize laureates, have affirmed the growing consensus that raising wages for the lowest-paid workers doesn't hurt the economy. In fact, by increasing consumer spending and creating jobs, it helps the economy. Studies have shown that every dollar increase for a minimum-wage worker results in $2,800 in new consumer spending by household, and of the 13 states that have increased the minimum wage since 2014, including New York, all but one experienced employment growth.
Through the Wage Board, New York can set fast-food workers on a path out of poverty, ease the burden on taxpayers and create a new national standard.
Roosevelt, too, faced powerful opposition to the minimum wage. But he did not pull his punches as he said: "No business which depends for existence on paying less than living wages to its workers has any right to continue in this country."

Correction: May 13, 2015, Wednesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An Op-Ed article on Thursday about wages in the fast-food industry misstated the proportion of its workers who are raising a child. It is 26 percent, not more than two-thirds. The article also misstated the industry's global revenues. They were $551 billion last year, not $195 billion, and the number is projected to grow to $645 billion by 2018, not $210 billion.

Full text:   Private employers in the United States added in April the smallest monthly number of workers in more than a year. And, in another report, the Labor Department found that nonfarm productivity fell in the first quarter as harsh winter weather depressed output.
Payrolls in the private sector increased by 169,000 last month, the ADP National Employment Report showed, the fewest since January 2014.
March payrolls were revised down to show 14,000 fewer jobs created than previously reported. The report developed with Moody's Analytics was released before the government's more comprehensive employment findings, which are due on Friday. Although it has a poor record of predicting nonfarm payrolls, the ADP report poses a downside risk to economists' expectations for nonfarm payrolls growth of 224,000 in April.
In its report on Wednesday, the Labor Department said labor-related production costs rose at their quickest pace in a year. Productivity declined at a 1.9 percent annual rate after dropping at a revised 2.1 pace in the fourth quarter. That was the first back-to-back fall in productivity since 2006.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast that productivity, hourly output per worker, would fall at a 1.8 percent rate, dropping from a previously reported 2.2 percent rate in the last quarter of 2014.
The productivity decrease, which mirrored the abrupt growth slowdown in the first quarter, is likely to be temporary. Still, the trend remains weak. Productivity rose 0.6 percent from a year ago.
Despite the weather disruptions, hours worked increased at a 1.7 percent rate in the first quarter.
With hours outperforming a 0.2 percent pace of decline in output, unit labor costs increased at a 5 percent rate in the first quarter. That was the fastest pace since the first quarter of 2014.
Unit labor costs, the price of labor per unit of output, increased at a 4.2 percent rate in the fourth quarter. They rose 1.1 percent compared with the first quarter of 2014, a sign that wage inflation remains benign. Compensation per hour increased at a 3.1 percent rate in the first quarter, also the quickest pace since the first quarter of 2014. Coming on the heels of a report last week showing a solid increase in labor costs in the first quarter, the rise in compensation suggests that wage inflation could be firming.
The steadily rising labor costs against the backdrop of weak productivity could squeeze corporate profits.
Also Wednesday, the Mortgage Bankers Association said applications for home mortgages in the United States fell last week as interest rates jumped. Its seasonally adjusted index of mortgage application activity, which tracks refinancing and home purchase demand, fell 4.6 percent in the workweek that ended Friday.
The group's seasonally adjusted index of refinancing applications fell 8.3 percent, to its lowest level since January, and the gauge of loan requests for home purchases, a leading indicator of home sales, rose 0.8 percent, to its highest level since June 2013.
The refinance share of total mortgage activity fell to 53 percent of applications, from 55 percent the previous week.
Rates for fixed 30-year mortgages averaged 3.93 percent in the week, up eight basis points from 3.85 percent the previous week. The survey covers more than 75 percent of retail residential mortgage applications in the country.

Full text:   PARIS -- It may not be at escape velocity yet, but the European economy is definitely picking up steam, an official forecast showed on Tuesday, as low oil prices, favorable foreign-exchange rates and central bank stimulus added momentum to a modest recovery.
The European Commission said it was revising upward its forecast for eurozone economic growth this year to 1.5 percent, from 1.3 percent, accelerating from the 0.9 percent growth posted last year. For 2016, the commission predicted that the eurozone economy, composed of the 19 member nations that share the euro, would grow by 1.9 percent.
"Eurozone G.D.P. is likely to beat both the U.S. and the U.K. in the first quarter, the first time since 2011," Christian Schulz, an economist with Berenberg Bank in London, said before the commission's new forecasts were announced. "It shows that Europe is becoming normal again."
He predicted that the eurozone would show first-quarter expansion of 1.6 percent. The United States' economy expanded a meager 0.2 percent at an annualized rate in the first three months of the year, while Britain's grew 1.2 percent. But for the full year, Mr. Schulz said, it was probable that the American economy would still grow faster.
Valdis Dombrovskis, the European Commission's vice president for the euro and social dialogue, said in a statement announcing the revised spring forecasts that European nations needed to carry out additional structural changes, spur investment and encourage "fiscal responsibility."
The commission said domestic demand was driving growth in gross domestic product, while investment was expected to rebound in 2016. The fall in energy prices that began in June, which appears to have ended, has had the effect of a stimulus for households, enabling them to spend more of their income on other goods and services.
The European Central Bank's recent policy of large-scale bond buying, known as quantitative easing, has helped by driving down interest rates, and the weaker euro has benefited exporters.
"The eurozone is a large, diversified economy that had been held back by the euro crisis and the E.C.B.'s reluctance to undertake aggressive easing," Mr. Schulz of Berenberg said. "Now that the E.C.B. has started quantitative easing, the eurozone economy is reacting just like the U.S. and U.K. economies responded when their central banks employed Q.E."
Mr. Schulz said that with the market on edge over Greece's lengthy bailout talks, the central bank action has also helped "by acting as an insurance policy, helping confidence." That is because the central bank could step in to buy the bonds of some of the bloc's more exposed members if Greece abandoned the euro in messy fashion.
No one is yet ready to declare the European economy out of the woods. Europe formally climbed out of recession about two years ago, but has since oscillated between stagnation and low growth without yet attaining the levels of output it had before the start of the crisis in 2008.
Unemployment remains at a punishing 11.3 percent in the eurozone, official data showed last week, and economists say it is probable that the labor market improvement, when it comes, will be slow.
The commission forecast that the eurozone jobless rate would still be high, at 10.5 percent, in 2016.
The E.C.B. started its bond-buying program after inflation began falling to levels that many economists warned were too low for safety and that were far below its target of slightly less than 2 percent. Inflation turned negative across the bloc late last year, raising fears of deflation, a self-reinforcing cycle of falling prices and poor growth that could have dire effects on banks and borrowers.
The commission said on Tuesday that inflation would "remain close to zero in the first half of 2015," picking up as the year wore on, as "domestic demand strengthens, output gaps narrow, the effects of lower commodity prices fade and the depreciation of the euro triggers higher import prices." For the year, it predicted inflation in the eurozone of just 0.1 percent, accelerating to 1.5 percent in 2016.
Mr. Schulz said that some of the most encouraging signs were coming from crisis-battered nations like Spain and Italy, where manufacturing appeared to be bouncing back faster than in many other countries. The two nations have taken tough measures to overhaul their labor markets, and are reaping the benefits now, he said.
"The problems in Europe now are limited to Greece, of course, and among the more normal economies, to France, because of a lack of reform there," he said.

Abstract: Walt Disney's stock hit a record high after it delivered quarterly results that beat Wall Street's estimates, thanks, in part, to rising revenue from its Walt Disney World Resort and other theme parks. The earnings season has given investors little to celebrate, said Tim Dreiling, a senior portfolio manager at a division of U.S. Bank Wealth Management.

Full text:   A combination of concerns knocked the stock market lower on Tuesday, ending a two-day run.
Crude oil climbed above $60 a barrel for the first time this year, raising expectations that inflation will go up and take interest rates along with it. Greece's government remained in a standoff with its European creditors.
"There are some jitters," said Bill Stone, chief investment strategist at PNC Asset Management Group. "Greece is definitely part of it. The other part is oil prices going up. That implies more inflation."
Major indexes wavered at the outset of trading, drifted lower throughout the morning, then spent the afternoon slowly ceding ground.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 25.03 points, or 1.2 percent, to 2,089.46. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 142.2 points, or 0.8 percent, to 17,928.20. The Nasdaq composite index fell 77.6 points, or 1.6 percent, to 4,939.33.
The price of oil jumped $1.47 to close at $60.40 a barrel, the first time crude has traded that high since early December, after reports that a Libyan oil terminal had closed. Brent crude rose $1.07, to $67.52, in London.
Talks between Greece and its lenders reached an impasse, raising concerns about the country's ability to handle a coming debt payment. Greece will have to scrounge for cash to make a payment of 750 million euros ($838 million) to the International Monetary Fund on May 12.
Among companies turning in results on Tuesday, Kellogg, the maker of Frosted Flakes and Pop-Tarts, reported that its first-quarter earnings fell 44 percent as a rising United States dollar offset sales. The company fell 95 cents, or 1 percent, to $63.18.
Walt Disney's stock hit a record high after it delivered quarterly results that beat Wall Street's estimates, thanks, in part, to rising revenue from its Walt Disney World Resort and other theme parks. Last weekend, the company's "Avengers: Age of Ultron" had the second-biggest domestic opening behind the first "Avengers." But Disney's stock eventually gave up its early gain and ended the day slightly lower, down 22 cents at $110.81.
The earnings season has given investors little to celebrate, said Tim Dreiling, a senior portfolio manager at a division of U.S. Bank Wealth Management. Roughly seven out of every 10 companies in the S.&P. 500 have reported results that beat analysts' estimates for quarterly profit, according to S&P Capital IQ. Yet more than half have fallen short of revenue targets.
"That's what is concerning," Mr. Dreiling said.
Major markets in Europe slumped. France's CAC-40 sank 2.1 percent, while Germany's DAX fell 2.5 percent. Britain's FTSE 100 slipped 0.8 percent. European government bond prices also fell, shooting government borrowing costs up.
The Shanghai composite index in mainland China had its worst day in months, losing 4.1 percent, in turn dragging down Hong Kong's Hang Seng 1.3 percent. Markets in Japan, South Korea and Thailand were shut for holidays.
Back in the United States, government bond prices fell, raising the yield on the 10-year Treasury note to 2.18 percent from 2.15 percent the day before.
In commodities trading, gold rose $6.40 to end at $1,193.20 an ounce, while silver picked up 14 cents to $16.58 an ounce. Copper added 1 cent, to $2.94 a pound.
In other trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, wholesale gasoline rose 2.9 cents to close at $2.063 a gallon; heating oil rose 3.6 cents to close at $2.015 a gallon; and natural gas fell 4.1 cents to close at $2.780 per 1,000 cubic feet.

Abstract: With the huge drop in the price of oil, Venezuela's only major export, the nation's central bank reported last week that the country's foreign currency reserves, essential for international trade and debt payments, were at their lowest level in almost 12 years. Estimates of the import fraud vary, but a former president of Venezuela's central bank, Edmée Betancourt, has said that up to $20 billion of the $59 billion that went to product imports in 2012 disappeared through fraudulent transactions.

Full text:   CARACAS, Venezuela -- The weed whackers were $12,300. Each.
Then there was the $1.8 million machinery to kill and gut chickens. When the police checked it, they found a worthless jumble of rusted scrap metal.
And there were the businessmen who collected $74 million to ship chemicals and other products from abroad -- but sent almost nothing in return.
For years, Venezuela has had a hole in its pocket, a very big hole.
The government's complex currency system has led to exorbitant schemes by importers, who wildly inflate the value of goods brought into the country to grab American dollars at rock-bottom exchange rates. Sometimes, they fake the shipments altogether and import nothing at all.
Then they just pocket the dollars that the government provides, or sell some of the money for a gargantuan profit on the soaring black market here for American currency.
Tens of billions of dollars needed for vital imports have been drained this way from Venezuela's treasury, officials say, but the loss is especially painful now.
With the huge drop in the price of oil, Venezuela's only major export, the nation's central bank reported last week that the country's foreign currency reserves, essential for international trade and debt payments, were at their lowest level in almost 12 years.
That has Venezuelans on the left and the right in rare agreement, clamoring for someone to be held accountable for the vanished billions.
"It's scandalous," said Víctor Álvarez, a leftist economist and government minister under Hugo Chávez, the former president who died in 2013. "It's like the robbery that our people were subject to in the time of the conquest and the colonies, when the gold and silver were carted off by the ton."
During the boom years of high oil prices, little was done to stop the billions that disappeared through corruption and fraud.
But today, with the country in a deep economic crisis marked by recession, crippling inflation and shortages of goods like milk, condoms and shampoo, the missing billions are particularly conspicuous.
Many store shelves lie bare, and people wait in line for hours to buy basics, a crisis made much worse by the years of hemorrhaging dollars through import fraud.
"Taking into consideration the behavior of oil prices, these are resources that we could use right now," said Ricardo Sanguino, a governing party legislator appointed by President Nicolás Maduro to lead a commission to investigate the fraud.
Estimates of the import fraud vary, but a former president of Venezuela's central bank, Edmée Betancourt, has said that up to $20 billion of the $59 billion that went to product imports in 2012 disappeared through fraudulent transactions.
One economic consulting firm, Ecoanalítica, estimated that about $69.5 billion was stolen through import fraud from 2003 to 2012. It said that 20 percent of the importing done by private companies had been bogus, while 40 percent of the imports carried out by government agencies and government-run companies had been fraudulent.
The schemes have been so rampant that exporters in a free-trade zone in Panama invoiced $1.4 billion in shipments to Venezuela. Yet Panamanian officials said that $937 million of that was a sham, with companies billing for goods that never existed.
At the heart of the import ploys are the country's currency controls, which were begun in 2003 by Mr. Chávez. They are based partly on the populist notion that providing cheap, essentially government-subsidized dollars to importers translates to cheap imported goods for the masses.
But economists say the controls create vast incentives for fraud.
"There are lots of Venezuelan multimillionaires thanks to this system," said one importer of clothing, food, medicine and other products, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. He said that he regularly shipped in only about 10 percent of what he claimed to be importing.
Venezuela is heavily dependent on imports for food and other basic goods, as well as for raw materials needed to manufacture many items. But exporters abroad do not want to trade in bolívares, Venezuela's currency. They want dollars or other foreign currency, like euros.
So in Venezuela, importers obtain government permission to import a product and then apply to the nation's currency control agency to buy the dollars needed to pay for the shipment from abroad.
The system is rife with opportunities for abuse, the main one being wildly inflated invoices.
In the weed whacker case, two companies imported 88 machines for a total invoice of over $1 million, according to government documents. The companies claimed that each machine cost up to $12,300, even though investigators found that similar items cost as little as a few hundred dollars each.
In another case, the documents assert, a company importing agricultural equipment declared the value of a machine to remove kernels from ears of corn as $477,750, when the real price was about $2,900.
Such maneuvers mean automatic profits, which only multiply once the money goes through the black market.
An importer can buy United States currency from the government for as little as 6.3 bolívares to the dollar, then turn around and get as many as 280 bolívares to the dollar on the black market.
Venezuelans call the churning of bolívares and dollars "the bicycle" because the process can go around and around indefinitely, generating exorbitant profits in both currencies along the way.
A s the economic crisis has deepened in recent months, the government has cut back sharply on the dollars available to importers, worsening shortages but still not eliminating opportunities for fraud.
"In Venezuela, your real business isn't your 'business,' " the importer said. "Your real business is what's behind your 'business.' "
He explained that hefty bribes, which can add up to hundreds of thousands of dollars per deal, needed to be paid at numerous steps to receive permission to import a product, to get speedy approval for applications to buy foreign currency, to certify fraudulent imports and to have the dollars released.
He said that after paying bribes and other costs, an importer could wind up with about 60 percent of the dollars originally bought from the government. The actual merchandise brought into the country is often beside the point, the importer said, and many times he gives his away to military officers or government officials.
Jorge Giordani, a former finance and planning minister, has often railed against the fraud that permeates the system.
"It's a financial system that operates like a sieve," he said in a recent interview.
The scale is mind-boggling, creating distortions in the regional economy.
In Ecuador, prosecutors charged three Venezuelan businessmen with using a bevy of shell companies to receive about $74 million for inflated or phantom shipments to Venezuela in 2012 and 2013.
The scheme contributed to the collapse of an Ecuadorean bank that reported losses of tens of millions of dollars. Ecuadorean prosecutors have alleged other ploys involving other companies, totaling about $150 million in fraudulent exports to Venezuela.
Large amounts of the money siphoned out of Venezuela pass through the United States. The authorities here identified the shipper of the bogus chicken processing equipment as a Florida company.
Ecuadorean prosecutors have tracked millions of dollars transferred to the United States by companies involved in the Venezuelan fraud.
And a United States Treasury Department investigation made public in March uncovered a money laundering ring that had moved $4.2 billion out of Venezuela though import-related schemes and other means. The investigators determined that at least $50 million had passed through the American financial system.
Mr. Maduro, a leftist president who was elected by a narrow margin in 2013, has often come under pressure to attack government corruption.
In December 2013, Mr. Maduro appointed the commission to investigate the import ploys, calling them "a fraud against the republic."
"I am going to reveal to the county the truth about what happened there, because it was a vulgarity," Mr. Maduro said.
Jesús Faría, a member of the commission and a governing party lawmaker, said in a television interview last month that in just a sampling of cases, the commission had found that more than 250 companies "had broken the law and that the prosecutor's office had hundreds of companies to evaluate and investigate."
"Nevertheless, I have not seen that any of these companies have been punished," he added.
There appears to be only one criminal case in which prosecutors have charged a high-level official at the currency control agency with wrongdoing.
The official, Francisco Navas, was arrested in 2013 and has yet to stand trial. He is charged with money laundering and conspiracy, accused of taking bribes to sign off on millions of dollars of payments to companies for bogus imports. According to the testimony of an agency vice president, Mr. Navas charged companies the equivalent of about 46 cents for each dollar he approved.
His lawyer, Alonso Medina, said that Mr. Navas was a scapegoat, charged so that the authorities had someone to "hold responsible before public opinion."

Full text:   LONDON -- When the U.K. Independence Party received a donation of 1 million pounds a few weeks ago -- about $1.5 million -- it seemed like a big lift heading into the British general election on Thursday.
But the populist, anti-immigration party then faced an unusual problem: spending its cash.
In a country where television election spots are banned, billboards are booked long before voting day, and other strict laws constrain election spending, that task proved so hard that the party says it is unlikely to use all the money before Britons go to the polls.
Britain is not unusual in running short, relatively inexpensive campaigns. But few nations combine enthusiastic fascination with American-style politics -- the governing Conservatives and the opposition Labour Party both hired top advisers to President Obama this election cycle -- with campaign finance rules so stringent that they would seem better suited to City Council races in the United States.
Hillary Rodham Clinton is aiming to raise at least $1 billion for her presidential campaign. Mr. Obama and his opponent in 2012, Mitt Romney, combined to spend nearly $2 billion. Mr. Obama's campaign spent $25,000 on flower arrangements months before the general election even got underway; in 2008, his campaign shelled out at least $140,000 to companies that make American flags.
In Britain, by contrast, each party is limited to spending $29.5 million in the year before the election. The last time around, in 2010, the Conservatives actually spent about $25 million, and Labour less than half that. American presidential candidates spent about as much money on raising money in 2012 -- around $37 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics -- as the two main British parties spent on their entire campaigns in 2010.
Reflecting the strict spending limits as well as a parliamentary system in which the outcome of a national election is determined in 650 constituencies, much of the campaigning in Britain remains local, with candidates pounding the streets, knocking on doors, issuing leaflets and sending mail.
Even these expenditures have to be recorded in minute detail and submitted to the election authorities. Spending limits also apply to organizations like charities or unions that want to campaign ahead of elections.
Justin Fisher, a professor of political science at Brunel University London, said the American system was seen in Britain "as the worst of all worlds," focused on "raising money and not about getting ideas across."
Oliver Coppard, the Labour Party's candidate in Sheffield Hallam, volunteered in New Hampshire during Mr. Obama's campaign in 2012 and was struck by the resources available to American candidates -- down to the number of bumper stickers, balloons and campaign leaflets.
"I was pretty stunned by the number of garden signs and by the sheer volume of adverts on TV," he said.
A crucial difference with the United States lies in Britain's ban on advertising on commercial television and radio.
Instead, the parties are given pre-election broadcasts that are screened both on commercial television and by the British Broadcasting Corporation. They are also starting to spend considerable sums on digital advertising as they try to reach voters online and through social media.
Complex rules also govern spending by the parties' local candidates for the five months before the election. There is a ceiling of about $60,000, plus an amount calculated according to the number of voters in each region and whether they live in a rural or urban area.
(In the United States last year, the 10 most expensive races for the 435 seats in the House of Representatives each ran up more than $8 million in total spending, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.)
According to Matt Badcock, principal lecturer in sociology at Leeds Beckett University, British politicians spend less than half per vote what they did, in inflation-adjusted terms, at one point in the 19th century.
The election of 1880, Mr. Badcock said, is thought to have cost more than £100 million in 2002 prices, as opposed to the £45.5 million spent by parties and their candidates locally in the weeks immediately before the 2010 British election.
Some of the expenses incurred by 19th-century politicians, such as getting voters to register, have been taken over by the public authorities, he said. But vote-buying was so rife that a law was introduced in 1883 to curb the practice.
Since then, election spending figures have tended to disprove the common belief that there is an inexorable "linear upward path for expenditure," Mr. Badcock said, adding that politicians "don't spend money where it is not going to be effective."
Mr. Fisher of Brunel University said that resources in individual electoral districts were "much better focused" than those devoted to national campaigning, generating "more bang for your buck."
While digital advertising offers new opportunities, Mr. Fisher said, so far "there is no evidence that it is making a big difference."
The U.K. Independence Party has spent money on its digital campaign in recent weeks but has few other options for a last-minute spending splurge, particularly since the prime billboard locations are already booked.
"Obviously, we are not complaining," said Gawain Towler, a senior official in the party. "We are not worried about the thought that we might have a couple of beans left after May 7."

Abstract: Just the annual bonuses for just the sliver of Americans who work just in finance just in New York City dwarfed the combined year-round earnings of all Americans earning the federal minimum wage. Congressional leadership is showing resolve to slash: A) subsidies for private jets; B) the carried interest tax loophole for billionaires; C) food stamps; D) the estate tax on couples with estates worth more than $10.9 million.

Full text:   THE eruptions in Baltimore have been tied, in complex ways, to frustrations at American inequality, and a new measure of the economic gaps arrived earlier this year:
It turns out that the Wall Street bonus pool in 2014 was roughly twice the total annual earnings of all Americans working full time at the federal minimum wage.
You read that right: Just the annual bonuses for just the sliver of Americans who work just in finance just in New York City dwarfed the combined year-round earnings of all Americans earning the federal minimum wage.
We've been walloped with staggering statistics like this long enough that although this used to be a Democratic issue, Republicans are now speaking up. "The United States is beset by a crisis in inequality," warned Senator Mike Lee of Utah, a Republican with Tea Party support (although he added that his concern is gaps in opportunity, not wealth).
Likewise, Lloyd Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, declared recently that "we have to do a better job" of curbing inequality.
Yet while we broadly lament inequality, we treat it as some natural disaster imposed upon us. That's absurd. The roots of inequality are complex and, to some extent, reflect global forces, but they also reflect our policy choices.
In his new book, "The Great Divide," Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel Prize-winning economist, includes two chapters whose titles sum it up: "Inequality Is Not Inevitable" and "Inequality Is a Choice."
"I overheard one billionaire -- who had gotten his start in life by inheriting a fortune -- discuss with another the problem of lazy Americans who were trying to free ride on the rest," Stiglitz writes. "Soon thereafter, they seamlessly transitioned into a discussion of tax shelters."
Say what?
We as a nation have chosen to prioritize tax shelters over minimum wages, subsidies for private jets over robust services for children to break the cycle of poverty. And the political conversation is often not about free rides by corporations, but about free rides by the impoverished.
Kansas' Legislature is so concerned with this that it recently banned those receiving government assistance from, among other things, spending welfare funds on cruise ships (there is, of course, no indication that this was a problem). Will Kansas next address the risk that food stamps are spent on caviar and truffles? We all know that public money is better used to subsidize tax-deductible business meals by executives at fancy restaurants.
As Stiglitz notes: "Inequality is a matter not so much of capitalism in the 20th century as of democracy in the 20th century."
So if we were to choose to make inequality a priority, what policies could we turn to? This month, Harvard University Press is publishing "Inequality: What Can Be Done?" by Anthony B. Atkinson, a British economist, in which he lays out 15 steps to reduce inequality. A few of his recommendations:
Government should be more concerned with monopolies and competition policy.
Trade unions should be bolstered to represent workers' interests.
Government should provide public-sector jobs at minimum wage to those who want them, in areas such as meals-on-wheels, elderly care, child care and so on.
In addition to a minimum wage, there should be a framework to restrain pay at the highest levels. Atkinson cites companies that have voluntarily decreed that executive pay should be capped at 65 or 75 times the average pay in the firm.
Personal income taxes should be made more progressive, with a maximum rate of 65 percent.
Every child should get a "child benefit" payment, to help keep kids out of poverty.
So if we're all upset at inequality, these are ideas to debate. Others, including Stiglitz, have put forth many more. Research groups like MDRC have rigorous evidence of what breaks cycles of poverty. In short: We're not helpless.
In the case of inequality, there's a bizarre disconnect between the scale of the challenge and the tools politicians are prepared to use. This is, according to a Pew survey last year, what the American public viewed as the greatest threat to the world, yet Congress won't even lift the federal minimum wage to the inflation-adjusted level it reached in the 1960s.
Indeed, answer this question on how Congress responds to inequality. More than one choice could be correct.
Congressional leadership is showing resolve to slash: A) subsidies for private jets; B) the carried interest tax loophole for billionaires; C) food stamps; D) the estate tax on couples with estates worth more than $10.9 million.
The answer is C and D -- steps that would hurt low-income children while offering a helping hand to billionaires. Congress is addressing inequality by exacerbating it at both ends.
Inequality is a tough problem, but we have tools that could begin to make a difference. The problem isn't inequality; the problem is us. We're paralyzed.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Factories in the United States expanded in April at the same pace as in March, but manufacturers are starting to curtail hiring in a possible sign of weakness. And data also released Friday showed that construction fell in March as an increase in nonresidential construction was offset by declines in home building and government projects.
The Institute for Supply Management, a trade group of purchasing managers, said on Friday that its manufacturing index was unchanged at 51.5. The index had dropped in the previous five months, though any reading above 50 signals expansion.
American manufacturers have faced a drag in recent months from falling oil prices and a stronger dollar. The drop in oil prices has cut into demand for pipelines and equipment used by drillers and energy companies. At the same time, the dollar has risen in value over the last year against the euro and other currencies, causing American-made goods to be more expensive abroad and hurting exports.
The drag from the West Coast ports disruption continues, as shipments have been delayed because of a labor dispute that was largely settled in February and March.
New orders and productivity improved in April, but the employment component of the index slipped below 50 to 48.3. The drop in the employment indicator could indicate less hiring ahead and the possibility of layoffs, or it could be a blip.
Bradley Holcomb, chairman of the ISM's manufacturing business survey committee, said he expected factory employment to rebound.
"It's more of tapping the brakes to assess where this manufacturing economy and overall economy are going," he said. " "We're obviously off to a slow start in the first quarter."
In March, construction in the United States fell 0.6 percent to a seasonally adjusted $966.6 billion after a flat reading in February, the Commerce Department said. Construction activity has fallen or shown no gain in four of the last five months, underscoring the economic toll from a severe winter.
For March, housing construction dropped 1.6 percent as both single-family construction and apartment building contracted. It was the biggest slide since June. Also in March, spending on government projects fell 1.5 percent, the third straight decline.
One bright spot in March was a 1 percent rise in nonresidential construction, with gains in hotels and office buildings. Economists are forecasting a rebound in coming months as warmer weather lifts activity.
Also Friday, the University of Michigan said consumer sentiment in April rose to its second-highest level since 2007.
The index rose to 95.9, from 93 in March, beaten since the recession began only by January's reading of 98.1. Over the last five months, sentiment has been, on average, at its highest level since 2004.
Richard Curtin, chief economist of the Michigan survey, attributed the April increase to optimism over consistently low inflation and low interest rates and improving prospects for jobs and incomes.
Since March 2014, the American economy has produced a healthy 3.1 million job gains. The government said on Wednesday that the economy grew at an annual rate of just 0.2 percent from January through March. But economists expect growth to strengthen in the spring.
"Consumers appear to be shrugging off recently disappointing economic data and stock market choppiness," Jim Baird, chief investment officer for Plante Moran Financial Advisors, said in a research note. "Despite evidence that the economy slowed considerably in the first quarter, sentiment remains relatively high and suggests that the important consumer spending engine isn't at risk of stalling."

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits tumbled to a 15-year low last week and consumer spending rose in March, signs the economy was regaining momentum after stumbling badly in the first quarter.
The economic outlook was brightened further by another report on Thursday showing a solid increase in wages in the first quarter.
"This morning's reports all point to an economy that is doing a lot better than the near-stagnation in first-quarter G.D.P. suggests," said Paul Ashworth, chief United States economist at Capital Economics in Toronto.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 34,000 to a seasonally adjusted 262,000 for the week ended April 25, the lowest reading since April 2000, the Labor Department said.
Though the decline, which far exceeded Wall Street's expectations for a drop to 290,000, most likely exaggerates the labor market's health, it bolstered views that March's sharp moderation in job growth was probably an aberration.
Separately, the Commerce Department said consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of American economic activity, rose 0.4 percent last month as households stepped up purchases of big-ticket items like automobiles.
The increase followed a 0.2 percent gain in February and indicated that consumer spending picked up momentum at the end of the first quarter, which bodes well for consumption in the April-June period.
While that should lift growth in the second quarter, the rebound in economic activity could be crimped by an inventory overhang, a strong dollar and continuing spending cuts in the energy sector, which has been hit by lower oil prices.
Another report showed that factory activity in the Midwest accelerated in April, pushing further away from a five-and-a-half-year low hit in February.
Adjusted for inflation, consumer spending rose 0.3 percent in March after being flat in the previous month.
The economy slowed to a crawl in the first quarter as it struggled with severe winter weather, a now-settled labor dispute at normally busy West Coast ports, the strong dollar and lower energy prices, which have cut into domestic oil production.
Spending last month picked up despite personal income's being flat. But the income weakness will probably prove temporary as the labor market gradually tightens.
In a fourth report, the Labor Department said the Employment Cost Index, the broadest measure of labor costs, advanced 0.7 percent after a 0.5 percent rise in the fourth quarter.
The index is widely viewed by policy makers and economists as one of the better measures of labor market slack.
In the 12 months through March, labor costs jumped 2.6 percent, the largest rise since the fourth quarter of 2008. They are approaching the 3 percent threshold that economists say is needed to bring inflation closer to the central bank's 2 percent target.
Private sector wages and salaries increased 0.7 percent after gaining 0.5 percent in the previous quarter. They rose 2.8 percent in the 12 months through March, the biggest gain since the third quarter of 2008.
"The conditions seem to be in place for labor costs to start breaking out on the upside," said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pa.

Full text:   The 2016 campaign should be almost entirely about issues. The parties are far apart on everything from the environment to fiscal policy to health care, and history tells us that what politicians say during a campaign is a good guide to how they will govern.
Nonetheless, many in the news media will try to make the campaign about personalities and character instead. And character isn't totally irrelevant. The next president will surely encounter issues that aren't currently on anyone's agenda, so it matters how he or she is likely to react. But the character trait that will matter most isn't one the press likes to focus on. In fact, it's actively discouraged.
You see, you shouldn't care whether a candidate is someone you'd like to have a beer with. Nor should you care about politicians' sex lives, or even their spending habits unless they involve clear corruption. No, what you should really look for, in a world that keeps throwing nasty surprises at us, is intellectual integrity: the willingness to face facts even if they're at odds with one's preconceptions, the willingness to admit mistakes and change course.
And that's a virtue in very short supply.
As you might guess, I'm thinking in particular about the sphere of economics, where the nasty surprises just keep coming. If nothing that has happened these past seven years or so has shaken any of your long-held economic beliefs, either you haven't been paying attention or you haven't been honest with yourself.
Times like these call for a combination of open-mindedness -- willingness to entertain different ideas -- and determination to do the best you can. As Franklin Roosevelt put it in a celebrated speech, "The country demands bold, persistent experimentation. It is common sense to take a method and try it: If it fails, admit it frankly and try another. But above all, try something."
What we see instead in many public figures is, however, the behavior George Orwell described in one of his essays: "Believing things which we know to be untrue, and then, when we are finally proved wrong, impudently twisting the facts so as to show that we were right." Did I predict runaway inflation that never arrived? Well, the government is cooking the books, and besides, I never said what I said.
Just to be clear, I'm not calling for an end to ideology in politics, because that's impossible. Everyone has an ideology, a view about how the world does and should work. Indeed, the most reckless and dangerous ideologues are often those who imagine themselves ideology-free -- for example, self-proclaimed centrists -- and are, therefore, unaware of their own biases. What you should seek, in yourself and others, is not an absence of ideology but an open mind, willing to consider the possibility that parts of the ideology may be wrong.
The press, I'm sorry to say, tends to punish open-mindedness, because gotcha journalism is easier and safer than policy analysis. Hillary Clinton supported trade agreements in the 1990s, but now she's critical. It's a flip-flop! Or, possibly, a case of learning from experience, which is something we should praise, not deride.
So what's the state of intellectual integrity at this point in the election cycle? Pretty bad, at least on the Republican side of the field.
Jeb Bush, for example, has declared that "I'm my own man" on foreign policy, but the list of advisers circulated by his aides included the likes of Paul Wolfowitz, who predicted that Iraqis would welcome us as liberators, and shows no signs of having learned from the blood bath that actually took place.
Meanwhile, as far as I can tell no important Republican figure has admitted that none of the terrible consequences that were supposed to follow health reform -- mass cancellation of existing policies, soaring premiums, job destruction -- has actually happened.
The point is that we're not just talking about being wrong on specific policy questions. We're talking about never admitting error, and never revising one's views. Never being able to say that you were wrong is a serious character flaw even if the consequences of that refusal to admit error fall only on a few people. But moral cowardice should be outright disqualifying in anyone seeking high office.
Think about it. Suppose, as is all too possible, that the next president ends up confronting some kind of crisis -- economic, environmental, foreign -- undreamed of in his or her current political philosophy. We really, really don't want the job of responding to that crisis dictated by someone who still can't bring himself to admit that invading Iraq was a disaster but health reform wasn't.
I still think this election should turn almost entirely on the issues. But if we must talk about character, let's talk about what matters, namely intellectual integrity.

Abstract: Despite the Fed's optimism, a number of Wall Street forecasters cut their estimates for second-quarter growth as they concluded that the weakness, caused in part by cold weather but also by cautious consumers and the strength of the dollar, could linger. A sharp reduction in business investment also weighed on first-quarter output, a trend that some experts attributed to big cuts in spending in the energy industry as falling oil prices prompted drillers and oil production companies to pull back.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Repeating an all-too-familiar pattern, the American economy barely grew during the first three months of the year, but the Federal Reserve said Wednesday that it expected growth to rebound, suggesting that it still intends to start raising its benchmark interest rate this year.
Despite the Fed's optimism, a number of Wall Street forecasters cut their estimates for second-quarter growth as they concluded that the weakness, caused in part by cold weather but also by cautious consumers and the strength of the dollar, could linger.
"The U.S. economy stumbled badly in the first quarter," said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco. "Modest growth in the fourth quarter of 2014 turned into virtually no growth in the first quarter of 2015."
Weak winter growth has become a hallmark of the post-recession economy. The gross domestic product expanded just 0.2 percent during the first quarter, according to an initial government estimate published Wednesday morning.
Strong job growth during the first two months of the year was followed by a disappointing increase of 126,000 jobs in March, and the Fed, in a statement after a two-day meeting of its policy-making committee, said labor market conditions had not improved over the last month. The federal government is scheduled to release an initial estimate of April job growth on May 8.
Inflation also remains sluggish. Although concerns about deflation have subsided, price inflation remains well below the 2 percent annual pace the Fed regards as healthy. Wages also continue to rise slowly, notwithstanding a recent spate of headlines as large employers like Walmart have announced modest increases.
The Fed's statement, however, described the latest round of economic setbacks as likely to be temporary. Officials hope that this year will follow the pattern of last year, when strong summer growth offset an even weaker first quarter.
"Although growth in output and employment slowed during the first quarter, the committee continues to expect that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace," the statement said.
The Fed did not directly address when it might start to raise short-term rates, which it has held near zero since December 2008. Officials have said they would begin to consider such an increase at the committee's next meeting, in June. Analysts generally predict that the Fed will not act before September, and possibly later.
The Fed's statement was approved by a unanimous vote of 10 to 0.
Domestic growth is being restrained by the weakness of the rest of the global economy. As the dollar has gained strength, American exporters have struggled. Foreign trade also was curtailed by the lingering effects of a labor dispute that slowed the flow of goods through West Coast ports. Net exports fell 7.2 percent in the first quarter, shaving nearly a full percentage point off the overall growth figure.
A sharp reduction in business investment also weighed on first-quarter output, a trend that some experts attributed to big cuts in spending in the energy industry as falling oil prices prompted drillers and oil production companies to pull back. At the same time, businesses piled up inventory, which lifted the reported pace of growth but led some analysts to cut back their expectations for the second quarter.
Public sector spending posted a surprising decline. State and local government expenditures fell at the steepest rate since the first quarter of 2012.
Consumer spending has been surprisingly weak despite the drop in gasoline prices that began last summer. Such spending, which makes up roughly two-thirds of gross domestic product, rose 1.9 percent, well below the 4.4 percent gain in the fourth quarter of 2014. Mr. Anderson said consumers were most likely using the windfall to pay down credit card debt or add to savings. He said he expected consumers to spend more aggressively later in the year, driving growth.
The estimate of economic growth was the first of three that the Commerce Department will release, and the number is often revised sharply. The average revision in the initial estimate is about 1.2 percentage points. The next estimate will come out on May 29.
Despite the slow start to the year, many economic forecasters share the Fed's expectation that the warmer weather will usher in better news.
"We believe weakness was grossly exaggerated, and there will be significant catch-up in Q2, but, of course, that remains to be seen," said Jim O'Sullivan, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y.
In a separate report later in the morning, the National Association of Realtors said pending home sales rose 1.1 percent in March. Pending sales are now at their highest level since June 2013, according to the Realtors' index. Some experts say the housing market should remain strong in the next few months, especially since the Fed does not seem to be in a rush to begin increasing its benchmark rate.
But Guy Berger, United States economist at RBS Global Banking and Markets, cautioned that some of the headwinds evident last quarter would not abate immediately.
The drop in energy-related spending will eventually level out, he said, but it will take some time. And the dollar remains strong compared with currencies like the euro, so no relief for exporters is in sight.
"The dollar has strengthened so much that it could restrain the magnitude of the rebound," Mr. Berger said.
After earlier predictions that the Fed might move as early as June, most economists now say it will wait at least until its September meeting, or even later. The latest data "strengthens the argument for a delay by the Fed," Mr. Anderson said.
At the same time, however, financial markets may be exaggerating the likely delay. Fed funds futures now imply just a 26 percent probability that the Fed will raise rates by September, and only a 52 percent probability of a first increase this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. By contrast, last month 15 of 17 Fed officials predicted that the Fed would begin to raise rates by the end of the year.
Mr. O'Sullivan said the Fed was in a wait-and-see mode.
"They are largely discounting the weakness in G.D.P. in Q1, but they will want to see more evidence that the trend remains solid and that the unemployment rate is still declining before starting the normalization process," he said. "They are not in a rush. We continue to expect tightening to start in September."
Most analysts are focused on the September meeting because it will be followed by a regular quarterly news conference with the Fed's chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen. The Fed has tended to announce major policy changes at such meetings. But Ms. Yellen insisted at her last such news conference, in March, that the Fed could also act at its July or October meetings, when she is not scheduled to take questions.
To underscore that point, the Fed invited reporters to participate in a test of a dial-in news conference system on Wednesday afternoon that would let Ms. Yellen speak with reporters on short notice. The Fed said any such call would also be broadcast.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The cardinal rule of central banking, in the United States and in most other industrial nations, is that annual inflation should run around 2 percent.
But as the Federal Reserve prepares to start raising its benchmark interest rate later this year to keep future inflation from exceeding that pace, it is facing persistent questions about the wisdom of the rule and the possible benefits of significantly increasing its target.
Higher inflation could disrupt economic activity, but it also would enhance the Fed's power to stimulate the economy during recessions. And some experts say the struggles of the Fed and other central banks to provide enough stimulus since the Great Recession suggest they could use more room for maneuvering.
"Most developed countries' central banks have experienced difficulty in providing sufficient monetary stimulus to spur a robust recovery in their economies," Eric Rosengren, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, said in a recent speech in London. "This may imply that inflation targets have been set too low."
As the Fed's policy-making committee concludes a two-day meeting in Washington on Wednesday, officials were expected to discuss how much longer the central bank should hold its benchmark rate near zero, as it had done since December 2008. Officials had planned to start raising rates between June and September, but growth has fallen short of the Fed's expectations this year, which could delay the liftoff.
Inflation has mostly remained well below the 2 percent target since the global economic downturn. The Fed's preferred measure, published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, rose just 1.4 percent during the 12 months ending in February.
But Fed officials want to start raising rates in anticipation of stronger growth and faster inflation. William C. Dudley, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said last week that "hopefully" the Fed would make its first move this year.
There is little prospect that any major central bank will raise its inflation target in the foreseeable future. Two percent is a global standard and the official line -- in Japanese, German and English -- is that it was carefully chosen, and that the stability of the target is a virtue in its own right.
There is also considerable political opposition to higher inflation. Some conservative economists and politicians argue that central banks should aim to keep inflation well below 2 percent.
But the broaching of the inflation targeting issue by Mr. Rosengren and other prominent officials -- including Olivier Blanchard, chief economist of the International Monetary Fund -- suggests an emerging willingness among policy makers to revisit an issue that for more than a generation has been treated as all but written in stone.
The case for raising the 2 percent target rests on the counterintuitive idea that moderate inflation is a good thing, helping to grease the wheels of commerce and prevent an outright fall in prices. This is widely accepted by economists. It is the reason that central banks aim for a modest inflation rate, rather than keeping prices at the same level from year to year. The question is, How much?
Central banks influence economic growth by raising and lowering borrowing costs. Higher costs crimp risk-taking; lower costs stimulate expansion. Those costs, expressed as interest rates, combine the price of money with an additional increment to compensate for inflation. Higher inflation means rates will run higher in normal times, allowing the Fed to make larger cuts during periods of duress.
In recent decades, as inflation generally declined, the Fed has had less room to make cuts. The Fed, for example, cut rates by 6.75 percentage points beginning in 1989, and by 5.5 points beginning in 2001. On the eve of the crisis in 2007, the Fed's benchmark rate stood at 5.25 percent. The Fed rapidly reduced that rate almost to zero -- but that did not provide enough stimulus on its own to revive the economy.
Laurence Ball, an economist at Johns Hopkins University, proposed in a 2013 paper that central banks should adopt 4 percent inflation targets. The benefits of avoiding a return to the so-called zero lower bound, he said, outweighed the potential economic disruption.
"A 2 percent inflation target is too low," he wrote. "It is not clear what target is ideal, but 4 percent is a reasonable guess, in part because the United States has lived comfortably with that inflation rate in the past."
The case for a higher target has been strengthened in recent years by a global decline in borrowing costs, which might be offset by higher inflation.
In April 2012, Fed officials predicted that the benchmark rate would return to about 4.2 percent after the economy had recovered. In the Fed's most recent predictions, in March, the average estimate was that the rate would reach 3.7 percent.
And some economists regard even those estimates as optimistic. Lawrence H. Summers, the former Treasury secretary, argues that the developed world may have entered a period of "secular stagnation" in which borrowing costs are unlikely to rise significantly above current levels because of chronic lack of demand.
John Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said in an interview this month that if Mr. Summers was correct, it might become necessary for the Fed to consider raising its 2 percent target.
"If you really thought that's the world we're in because of the demographics or productivity growth -- if that's really what our future holds -- I think that's just a reality that you need to think about monetary policy and its ability to achieve goals," Mr. Williams said.
But Mr. Williams, like most central bankers, is not yet ready to do so.
He said the Fed had demonstrated in recent years that it retained considerable power to stimulate growth even after cutting rates nearly to zero through bond purchases and by announcing that it intended to keep rates near zero for an extended period.
David Lipton, the senior American official at the I.M.F., said recently that the crucial lesson was that central banks needed to take such measures more quickly. "It isn't necessarily that you ought to be at 3 or 4, it's that when you're at 2 you're just much more careful about preventing it from falling," he said.
It is also possible that rates will increase more than the Fed expects, easing the pressure. Ben S. Bernanke, the former Fed chairman, has argued in response to Mr. Summers that rates are being suppressed by a "savings glut" in some countries, notably Germany, that is likely to dissipate as growth improves.
James Hamilton, a professor of economics at the University of California, San Diego, co-wrote a recent paper that reached a similar conclusion.
"Those who see the current situation as a long-term condition for the United States are simply overweighting the most recent data from an economic recovery that is still far from complete," Mr. Hamilton wrote in a blog post.
Fed officials also see benefits in maintaining the 2 percent target, which was formalized in 2012 but had long been acknowledged informally. People have come to view 2 percent inflation as a reliable constant. When oil prices rose in the middle of the last decade, measures of inflation expectations showed that American consumers remained confident the effects would subside. In recent years, as inflation has consistently fallen short of the Fed's goals, those same measures show that confidence in an eventual rebound has not wavered.
"I don't see anything magical about targeting 2 percent inflation," Mr. Bernanke said at a panel sponsored by the I.M.F. But he added that the costs and disruptions of moving to a higher target could outweigh the benefits.
A higher inflation target also would require political support. Congressional Republicans already are upset that the Fed is trying to raise inflation back toward 2 percent. They would loudly object to any effort to enshrine a higher target.
Some Fed officials also see considerable costs in tolerating more inflation. Stanley Fischer, the Fed's vice chairman, said at a separate I.M.F. event this month that it was important to keep inflation low enough so that people did not need to pay it any attention. At 2 percent annual inflation, a dollar loses half its value in about 36 years; at 4 percent inflation it takes about 18 years.
"When you start getting up to 4 percent inflation you begin to see signs of indexation coming back and a whole host of the inefficiencies and distortions," Mr. Fischer said. A 4 percent target, he concluded, would be "a mistake."

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDED. As the "Che Guevara" ferry lurched with determination across Lake Nicaragua, inching toward Isla de Ometepe, it was difficult to decide where to train your eye. On one end of the island is Volcán Concepción, an active stratovolcano whose frequent eruptions leave in their wake neat streams of ash that, when the wind is right, resemble the detritus of a giant smokestack. On the other is Volcán Maderas, Concepción's smaller, lusher cousin.
Regardless of where your gaze rests, the $3 ferry ticket (prices are often quoted in dollars in Nicaragua) is a bargain, considering the staggering view: a span of deep blue water bookended by two formidable summits, shrouded in swirling mist.
Once you make landfall, the views go from dazzling to engrossing. The countryside at the foot of the volcanoes is blanketed by generous thickets of bougainvillea, poinsettia and hibiscus, palms and banana trees. The volcanoes dominate the roughly 100-square-mile island, though 30,000 mostly agrarian residents who settled there and a perpetual parade of tourists wedge their way in. Islanders ride horseback across grassy fields or herd goats, and young northern European tourists whiz by on mopeds.
This pastiche of natural and exotic wonder feels a world away from the bustle of mainland Nicaragua. Ometepe sits amid the largest freshwater lake in Central America, and that is one reason agua (water) is part of the country's name. The region has been pivotal to Nicaragua, first drawing Spanish settlers, then pirates and then the attention of the British, who sought it as a strategic point in an ultimately unsuccessful military campaign to wrest control from Spain. Mark Twain swooned over Ometepe's volcanic peaks in his "Travels With Mr. Brown." Before all this, though, the native Náhuatl who lived around the lake anointed it Cocibolca, or "sweet sea."
In the intervening centuries, Ometepe and Lake Nicaragua have remained a respite from occasional political and military flare-ups. In the civil war that ended 25 years ago, the region saw virtually no combat, since islanders went to the Honduran border or elsewhere on the mainland to fight. The beauty of Ometepe and the vast waters of Lake Nicaragua are two immutable constants that Nicaraguans can rely on.
That is bound to change if Wang Jing, a Chinese billionaire, has his way. A consortium he led won approval last year from the Nicaraguan government to build a canal across the country. The plan, which would connect the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific and shave about 500 miles off the shipping route from New York to Los Angeles, is the realization of a centuries-old dream that has outlasted the construction of the Panama Canal, about 450 miles south of the proposed route.
In late December, workers began building access roads for the $50 billion canal. It represented enough of a step forward that it sparked protests. But the future of the project remains in question, not the least because of Lake Nicaragua itself.
If the canal is completed, 55 miles of it would cut across the freshwater lake, transforming its bed and local rivers, but could also make this main source of the country's drinking water no longer potable. This magnificent body of water could very well be both the inspiration that first led explorers dating back to Napoleon to dream up the canal and an obstacle that stands in the way of its construction.
>
I visited Nicaragua in January and went to see Ometepe and the lake, where a good portion of the million-plus international tourists who visit the country every year go. The island is an essential element of a burgeoning eco-tourism industry, one whose selling point is the fact that Nicaragua has 0.01 percent of the world's land mass but 7 percent of its biodiversity.
The Nicaraguan government has yet to commission an environmental impact assessment on the canal plans. The company behind the canal, HK Nicaragua Canal Development Investment Company, or HKND, paid a private British firm, ERM, to do so.
Manuel Coronel Kautz, president of Nicaragua's canal authority, said the country's leaders have confidence in the reports that have been done. "Both HKND and ERM are very serious and careful, and the Nicaraguan government has no concerns about the project," he told me.
"As to the Nicaraguan government conducting a feasibility assessment, which would include cultural, social and environmental impacts, our country does not have the money for this, " he added, noting that the ERM feasibility study would be released by the end of April.
With all of this in mind, I wanted to make my own assessment, as a tourist, of what stands to be lost to travelers.
Like most visitors, I first saw Lake Nicaragua while traveling through the picturesque, vibrant colonial town of Granada, which sits on its northwest shore. After a jarring ride from Managua on the proverbial chicken bus -- packed to the gills with passengers and crates of crowing roosters -- I walked to the lakeshore, where gentle waves lapped at the wooden docks and the breeze brushed my face.
I continued on to the desolate Centro Turistico, a lakefront park, and was gradually accompanied by Santo, a wizened and toothless man on a bike who offered to rent me a kayak as he ushered me along to a shop at the end of the park's main road. There, I was introduced to Lorenzo, a young man from Las Isletas, an archipelago of more than 300 tiny tropical islands scattered about the northwest edge of the lake.
After settling into our kayaks on the beach, we maneuvered across the choppy lake, finally reaching the quiet channels and lagoons of Las Isletas. Lorenzo teased me about bullsharks lurking in the depths -- "four meters long!" he warned -- though I had read they were practically extinct since 1969, when the Somoza dynasty, which ruled the country for 40 years, built a shark-processing plant in Granada.
As we glided through Las Isletas, Lorenzo pointed out kingfishers and warblers swooping into the waters, swallows perched on lily pads and egrets gingerly traversing marshes. He grew excited at the yellow-chested oropendolas, with their ball-shaped nests dangling from tree branches, and then, barely visible in another tree, an iguana glaring down at us. At one point, he silently led me beneath a gargantuan mangrove and pointed with his oar under a limb before dozens of bats set off toward us.
Women scrubbed and beat clothes against rocks and along the muddy banks, and children dived from high earthen ledges. We paddled around one island with a well-manicured manor house draped in vines and surrounded by waterside gardens and a metal fence. Lorenzo told me it was the vacation home of Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, Nicaragua's president from 1990 until 1996.
As we headed back to Granada, Lorenzo asked me if I knew about the canal. I nodded.
"If it's built," he said, "the waters will go up and they will go down. But either way, we don't know if we will be able to fish here like we do now."
>
The canal project threatens not only Las Isletas' residents, but also several of Nicaragua's indigenous communities such as the Rama, Garifuna, Mayanga, Miskitu and Ulwa. The government maintains that the canal would provide an economic boost to a country sorely in need of one, where many earn $1 a day. The canal is expected to provide 25,000 jobs for Nicaraguans, HKND has said, and the Nicaraguan government projects that revenues could lift 400,000 people out of poverty in the next three years.
The canal would, of course, also help line the pockets of interests beyond Nicaragua by providing a cheaper route that accommodates the increasingly large ships used to transport goods from the eastern United States to the West Coast, and from Latin America to Asia.
The cost, however, is "staggering environmental devastation," according to Axel Meyer, a professor of zoology and evolutionary biology at the University of Konstanz in Germany who has conducted ecological research in Nicaragua for 30 years. In a commentary written for the journal Nature last year, he and a colleague pointed out that the canal plans include rights to build and operate industrial centers, airports, oil pipelines and a rail system.
Not only would the lake and its immense surrounding habitats be threatened by the required dredging, but the canal's accompanying development could imperil tropical rain forests, including two reserves (the Indio Maiz Biological Reserve and the Cerro Silva Natural Reserve), Mr. Meyer said.
That no independent environmental review of the project has been performed, Mr. Meyer told me, is not only suspect to those concerned with its potential effect but also troublesome for the builders themselves.
"To have an international, independent review will be important if the Chinese hope for World Bank support, or any other type of international money," he said.
One of the habitats standing to lose much is Ometepe, which relies on the lake for irrigation and is home, Mr. Meyer said, to its own unique flora and fauna, including a lungless salamander first discovered and described in just 2008, and Tomocichla tuba, a relatively rare cichlid fish.
My guide on Ometepe was Enoc, who first took me to the coffee plantation at Finca Magdalena, leading me later on a hike among the coffee trees that cover the higher slopes of Volcán Maderas. Descending the trail, I could hear shrieking. "Monkeys," Enoc said when he saw my puzzled face. "But if you want to see them, we'll have to go off trail."
I followed him through the brush and under barbed-wire fences until we reached a shaded grove, where Enoc motioned for me to be still as he pointed upward at a family of white-faced Capuchin monkeys -- some with babies on their backs -- clinging to the highest branches, their tails leisurely unfurling downward.
Afterward, Enoc drove me to a former tobacco and cotton farm now home to the Museo El Ceibo, which I had read exhibits mostly Nicaraguan coins and historical bills. I was initially unenthusiastic, not having much interest in numismatics, but quickly saw how the museum curators had cleverly used the córdoba, Nicaragua's national currency, to illustrate the dramatic rise and fall of the country's regimes, in part because every four years, the president gets to redesign it. The exhibit also highlighted the upheaval of wartime inflation, "when everyone got to be a millionaire," Enoc said with an arched brow.
From the museum, we drove to the Reserva Charco Verde, where we took the short hiking trail around the lagoon and watched butterflies swerve about, then we headed to the park hotel's veranda for a late lunch. As we sat at the water's edge, I asked Enoc about his family, and he told me of his wife and young daughter, and explained that he was building huts on nearby forestland, which he hopes to rent to tourists. It would take some time, he said, as he continued to work as a tour guide.
>
A few days before visiting Ometepe, I flew from Managua in a single-engine Cessna typically used to transport FedEx parcels to the area that would be the potential starting point of the canal. My plan had been to visit Pearl Lagoon, on the Caribbean coast, but as we landed, sheets of rain and heavy wind tossed the plane, and I knew the boat ride there was out of the question. My more immediate problem, however, was reaching Casa Rosa, a fishing lodge outside Bluefields where I had a reservation. A fellow passenger on the plane warned me that the road leading to it swells and floods during such a deluge, and he offered to arrange a jeep to get me out there. En route, we passed shanties and dilapidated Victorian homes enclosed by broad porches, echoes of this once-prosperous Dutch settlement, and also the graceful white and stained-glass Moravian church built by German missionaries in 1849.
Rosa met us at the end of the road leading to her sprawling hacienda. Her American husband, Randy, was out at sea, and as she prepared a shrimp lunch for me, I listened to her tales of fishing trips she and Randy had taken around the Caribbean, as she pointed out trophies for prize catches and framed, sun-blotched photos of jumbo tarpon. I was the only guest that evening, and later, after showing me to my modest room, she led me to another down the hall. It was spacious, with a sweeping view of the bay. This is where President Daniel Ortega stays overnight, before heading out on fishing expeditions with Randy, Rosa told me with a wry smile.
I woke early to sunny skies and headed for the harbor to board a panga, an outboard-powered fishing boat, for the Pearl Lagoon, but ended up having to wait, inexplicably, two hours before we shoved off. Weighted down with far too many passengers, and mounds of frayed baggage and ice chests packed with beer and food, we zipped through canals and sluices for an hour before I could see a kaleidoscope of thatched-roof bungalows on the shore.
Rosa had told me to ask for Casa Ulrich at Pearl Lagoon, and after a local at the harbor pointed me in the right direction, I found the proprietor, Fred, dozing on a hammock. After his wife woke him, and I introduced myself and asked about tours of the area, he looked at his watch and then said that he had bad news for me: The last boat back to Bluefields would be in a few hours, allowing too little time to visit the Pearl Cays, as I'd hoped. But there was the lagoon, Fred told me, and he'd lend me his kayak. After pushing out, I dodged divebombing albatrosses and watched fishing boats and pangas ply the bayous. When I returned to Fred's pier, he offered me garlic-sautéed lobster, chuckling that he hoped he could compensate for the slippery logistics of visiting Pearl Lagoon.
As I ate and Fred sipped beer, he pointed across the water at half-constructed stilt huts in anticipation of more tourists. Among the half-dozen canal routes drawn up through the years, he then told me, at least two would have touched the Caribbean just south of here, which could potentially mean more visitors.
If you want to imagine what the canal could bring, look no further than Panama, where its canal's locks are being expanded to increase capacity. Panama City, with its glistening skyscrapers, is a towering reminder of the canal's significance to world trade. The creation of the Panama Canal predates what we think of as ecotourism, but now that such a thing exists, Panama is known for its biodiversity in some parts. Its Caribbean coast offers surprisingly vibrant sights for scuba divers, and the country is home to 17 national parks. But it isn't Costa Rica. Its residents didn't forfeit a massive freshwater lake in exchange for a bustling economy either.
Regardless, the prospect of Nicaragua's canal perhaps provides the best reason to visit the country now, adding drama to what might otherwise be a pretty postcard tour of the tropics. I think of this when I recall my lunch with Enoc on Ometepe, when he pointed to the lake and at the Isla de Quiste, and beyond, two ferries shuttling between the island and the mainland. I took a long moment to absorb the dreamlike view, noticing the particularly tranquil waters stretching toward the horizon.

Full text:   Travelers have many complaints about air travel in the United States these days: crowded airports, slow security lines, subpar and expensive food. When added to rising ticket prices and fees, the problems on the ground become even more of an annoyance. Congress now has a chance to help fix some of them by raising the cap on a fee used to pay for airport improvements.
Airports are allowed to levy a passenger facility charge of up to $4.50 per ticket to help pay for projects like new or expanded terminals and runways that have been approved by the Federal Aviation Administration. The cap was last increased in 2000, and airports say it should be raised to $8.50 and indexed for inflation.
An airline trade group, Airlines for America, argues that airports already have access to a lot of money from gate fees and rents. And the airlines say an increase in fees would reduce demand for air travel. That's preposterous coming from an industry that has imposed multiple extra charges, for the cost of fuel, checked baggage and so on.
This much is clear: Many American airports have seen better days. Vice President Joe Biden called La Guardia Airport a third-world airport last year, an insult to the swanky terminals at many airports in developing nations like China and India. The airlines have a point when they note that local airport officials have used the money they already have for nonaviation projects. United Airlines complained last year that the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey used revenue from Newark Liberty International Airport for a bridge project in New Jersey.
Congress should raise the maximum fee, then instruct the F.A.A., which decides on specific fees for individual airports, to make sure the money is used on projects that will benefit passengers. More gates, for instance, would foster competition among the industry giants -- American, Delta, Southwest and United -- and allow smaller airlines to grow. At many hubs, one or two airlines control a majority of gates and flights, which gives them the power to raise fares.
Like the rest of the nation's transportation system, aging airports need renovation. But lawmakers have to make sure the money is well spent.

Full text:   "Be careful."
I can't count how many times I've heard that warning in the 14 months since I decided to move to Moscow from Berlin. It's as if I were entering a war zone.
In fairness, those 14 months have seen a string of calamitous events that have left much of Russia transformed: the annexation of Crimea; war in eastern Ukraine; the deterioration of relations with the West; sanctions; President Vladimir V. Putin's clampdown on political opposition, media and the arts; and the collapse of the ruble and slowdown of the Russian economy.
Not surprisingly, tourism is part of that stagnation. Since the beginning of 2014, tourism to Russia has declined 35 percent, according to the Association of Tour Operators of Russia. Tourism from the West has been cut in half.
Yet for visitors, life generally goes on as usual in the affluent, cosmopolitan centers of Moscow and St. Petersburg where the vast majority of foreign tourists spend most or all of their time. Except for areas near the Ukraine border or in the long-embattled North Caucasus, there are no major Western advisories against travel to Russia. The State Department is the most cautious, warning Americans against attending demonstrations and urging "good security practices" in public places.
Still, contrary to the images often evoked by the news media, there's little evidence to suggest that Russia's top destinations are any less safe now for visitors than they were a few years ago.
That's not to say there has not been a change in mood. As a Western tourist anywhere, it's often a good idea to avoid political discussions in places with very drunk people, but even more so in Russia. Helped along by television propaganda, many people in Russia blame the West for their current economic problems and the war in Ukraine. The proportion of Russians who say they have a negative view of the United States has more than doubled over the past year, according to a recent poll by the independent Levada-Center. Yet there's a sizable gap between what is said in opinion polls, and what's represented in everyday interactions.
Or as my friend Maria Baronova, a prominent opposition activist, once put it: "We hate you Americans so much that we treat you like V.I.P.s."
Long gone may be the days when speaking loudly in American English was the best way to make it past "face control" at the entrances of Moscow's exclusive nightclubs, but after nearly a year here, I have yet to see or hear of Western tourists being harassed because of their nationality. I've witnessed more anti-American sentiment in Berlin, albeit of the smug European leftist variety, than I have in Moscow.
"I was expecting way more of a difference," said Kate Wood, a 16-year-old from Chapel Hill, N.C., who was visiting Moscow for the second time as part of an annual church trip to volunteer at an orphanage in the Kirov region. I came upon her and several of her fellow congregants eating ice cream and speaking loudly in English at a cafe on the ground floor of GUM department store on Red Square.
"I guess I was thinking that we would need to keep a lower profile," added Ms. Wood, who was last in Moscow before Western sanctions or the war in eastern Ukraine, "but no one's reacted badly to us at all, and we're even kind of loud."
Probably the biggest selling point for visiting Russia now, though, is the drastic devaluation of the ruble, which lost more than half its worth at the end of last year. Even taking into account inflation (recorded at 16.7 percent in February) and the ruble's considerable rebound over the past few months, the country is more affordable than at any time in recent memory. At the beginning of 2014, a dollar bought 32.86 rubles. In mid-April this year, it bought 49.80.
For tourists, this means paying 15 to 50 percent less for just about everything. A year ago, a cappuccino in Moscow cost the equivalent of $8 or $9. Now it's rarely more than $5. Though airlines, even Russia's Aeroflot, keep their tickets indexed at dollar rates, most hotels have not substantially raised their ruble prices.
This means that the starting room rate in June at the Sheraton Palace, which is 11,900 rubles, has decreased from $362 to $226. A room at a budget hotel goes for around $50 these days, and a double at the Ritz-Carlton, at 28,910 rubles, was once just short of $900 and now comes in just over $550. In fact, luxury hotels in Moscow actually reported an 8 percent uptick in occupancy in the first two months of 2015, apparently because of travelers upgrading from midrange because of the currency rate, according to a recent report cited by The Moscow Times.
Though some tourist attractions have increased the entrance fee in rubles, they are still more affordable for visitors with foreign currency. The Kremlin's entrance fee has increased since the beginning of 2014 from 350 to 500 rubles, but in dollars, it has dropped from $10.65 to $9.54. Entrance for non-Russians to the Tretyakov State Gallery, with its stunning collection of medieval Russian religious art, is now 450 instead of 360 rubles, but its dollar price has dropped 10 percent.
Most cathedrals and churches seem not to have increased their entrance fees, nor has the phenomenal Russian Museum in St. Petersburg, meaning all are around 40 percent cheaper for visitors. The State Hermitage Museum there seems to be the only major attraction that is actually more expensive for foreigners, though not by much. It doubled its price in rubles, but the dollar price increased by about a buck.
Ruble ticket prices to the Bolshoi Theater have not changed. A decent seat for an opera or ballet on the recently refurbished historic stage still sells in the 3,000- to 9,000-ruble range, which used to start around $90 but now starts at $57. Of course, that's only if you manage to buy from the theater itself. The scalper racket is as strong as ever, but even scalpers' more capricious price schemes, anywhere from $50 to upward of $500, are now further within range of budget travelers.
Restaurants and bars are now significantly more affordable for foreigners, and the economic crisis means they are less crowded. But even if a reservation is no longer indispensable, eating out requires a bit more strategizing. The culinary scenes in Moscow and St. Petersburg expanded greatly in the past decade, with international cuisine dominating the field: French, Japanese, Italian, Thai or, to mixed effect, some fusion of two or more. But because of Mr. Putin's retaliatory ban on Western food imports, many Muscovites' most beloved Continental-style restaurants either cannot find or can't afford the ingredients they once relied on, and many have seen a drop-off in quality. The fare at sleek Ragout, urbane Ugolek and Jean Jacques, the favorite French bistro of the Russian opposition, is not what it used to be, and though Strelka Bar still has some of the best cocktails in town, its menu has also taken a hit.
It's a safer bet these days to go for food whose source is closer to home. LavkaLavka in Moscow and Cococo, its even better sister restaurant in St. Petersburg, are the best of the innovative restaurants offering updated, farm-to-table takes on traditional Russian cuisine. Dishes like Cococo's "tourist's breakfast," a cylinder of pearl barley, lightly salted beef tartare, smoked herbs and quail egg served theatrically in a blackened half tin can, or LavkaLavka's memorable borscht with organic beets, brisket and cured pork fat (known in Russia as salo) -- plus both restaurants' homemade vodka infusions -- will convert the staunchest nonbelievers. And the 40 percent markdown makes dinner feel like a steal.
"This is a very good moment to try to change the image of Russia and to attract tourists from different countries, because the ruble is so cheap," said Maya Lomidze, the executive director of the Association of Tour Operators of Russia. Indeed, some companies have managed to offset losses by using the ruble crash as a marketing angle.
"We make connections on the exchange rate to attract tourists and agents from different countries, and I think it works quite well," said Olya Skoveleva, a travel manager at Visit Russia, a private tour company that actually reports a 15 percent increase in Western tourists in the past year. The Westerners' most popular destinations by far are Moscow and St. Petersburg, but the company also sends them to Sochi and the Black Sea or to smaller towns along the so-called Golden Ring of small cities northeast of Moscow, albeit in the company of an official guide.
Ms. Skoveleva said that many visitors are initially quite concerned for their safety but are ultimately reassured.
"We explain to them that nothing will disturb them regarding the political issues," she said. "Considering the international situation and how it appears in the media, it is even sometimes surprising to me, but it's the reality."
"Putin," she added, "is not the whole country."

Full text:   In the topsy-turvy world of negative interest rates in Europe that has now become a reality, a benchmark for an array of loans fell below zero for the first time this week. The three-month Euribor rate, set by a panel of European banks, hit negative 0.001 percent on Tuesday.
Denmark, Switzerland, Germany, Finland, Sweden and Austria have all issued bonds with negative yields, meaning investors holding to maturity may not get all their money back. Even Italy and Spain sovereign debt has traded in negative territory in recent weeks. This month, Switzerland became the first government to sell a 10-year bond at negative yields.
Negative interest rates have led to the equally strange phenomenon of banks paying borrowers to take loans.
If someone is really willing to pay me to take a loan, I'd like to get in on the action.
So I set out this week to see how -- and how much -- I could borrow at negative rates. I realize I might not be considered a safe-haven borrower on par with Switzerland, but I have a good credit score and have never missed a mortgage payment. (When I was in school during the inflation-laden 1970s, the concept of negative interest rates was so outlandish it wasn't even mentioned in economics courses.)
I discovered that, like many things that seem too good to be true, it wouldn't be easy. But at least in theory it's possible.
Negative interest rates have proved a conundrum for economists. A major factor in creating this situation has been the European Central Bank which, in pursuing a strategy of doing "whatever is needed" to preserve the euro, as Mario Draghi put it, has been buying substantial amounts of sovereign debt.
Whatever the cause of negative-rate loans, Goldman Sachs called them "the new normal" in a recent research note. Most mortgages in Spain, Portugal and Italy have adjustable rates pegged to Euribor, and some of these have slipped into negative territory. At least one large Spanish mortgage lender, Bankinter, has been paying negative interest to borrowers by deducting the amount from the principal of their loans, The Wall Street Journal reported. (Bankinter had pegged some mortgages to a benchmark denominated in Swiss francs, which is even deeper in negative territory than Euribor.)
These all appear to be existing variable-rate mortgages. But in Denmark, where the government's debt has been returning negative yields since 2012, one of the country's largest mortgage lenders, Nordea Kredit, originated a negative-rate mortgage in January, according to Danish news reports. Moreover, in Denmark many lenders offer interest-only loans and will finance the purchase of property outside Denmark.
One way to cash in on negative rates would be to buy European real estate -- an apartment in Paris, for example -- and borrow from a Danish mortgage lender. With an interest-only loan, the bank would pay you even as you collected rent from a tenant. Fortunately, I checked some of the Danish banks' websites before booking a flight to Copenhagen, since the issuance of negative-rate loans there has been suspended while the government studies the situation. (Among other problems, Danish banks' computers weren't programmed to handle negative rates.)
Elsewhere in Europe, the fate of negative-rate mortgages is clouded by litigation, since existing mortgage agreements didn't indicate what would happen if negative rates occurred. Even in Switzerland, banks aren't issuing negative-rate mortgages, according to Michael Blaser, managing director of Wüst und Wüst AG in Zurich, an affiliate of Christie's International Real Estate. But he noted there were a handful of old contracts in some banks that weren't fixed to a minimum of zero percent.
"This led to some very rare cases in which a customer got negative rates," Mr. Blaser said.
Still, Swiss mortgage rates are amazingly low: Credit Suisse quoted 1.02 percent for a variable rate pegged to three-month Swiss franc Libor, and 1.05 percent for a three-year fixed-rate mortgage. But non-European Union buyers of residential property need a Swiss residency permit. And Swiss banks will generally issue mortgages only for properties in Switzerland.
Several bankers I consulted also pointed out that borrowing and buying real estate in a foreign country involve currency risks. My Parisian apartment plan could expose me to three currencies: I earn money in dollars, but would be borrowing in Danish krone and buying the apartment in euros.
And of course I'd have to actually buy real estate, which might be a good investment, but requires upkeep and management. Far easier would be to exchange my existing mortgage on my New York apartment for one with a negative rate one that would pay me money, or to borrow in dollars and swap that for a negative-rate loan in euros, krone or francs.
I discussed this approach with Andy Hill, director of market practice and regulatory policy for the International Capital Market Association in London, who said that it's possible, at least in theory. He said a broker-dealer could help me execute a swap -- a transaction in which one income stream is exchanged for another.
In my case, I'd trade the payment stream on my mortgage for, say, a negative-rate payment stream on euro-denominated debt, capturing the spread between the two. My counterparty would make my interest payments, and I'd make his -- and in this case, since they are negative, I would be receiving payments.
Sounds like a great deal, although once again, as Mr. Hill pointed out, I'd have to assume the currency risks, which might erase any interest rate gains.
But don't hold your breath. I contacted four major banks and none were willing to help. No one seems interested in swap transactions of less than $10 million. You also have to be an "eligible contract participant" under Dodd-Frank legislation, which means, among other criteria, that individuals need net assets of over $10 million. And then there are transaction costs, which would diminish any rate advantages.
No one I spoke to knew of any individuals who had swapped into a negative-rate loan, although they thought wealthy individuals with a good private-banking relationship could probably do it. But they said some large corporate clients are using the strategy, and it's also becoming popular with hedge funds.
That may be an early warning sign: "Too often these strategies get crowded, unwind rapidly, and can end in significant foreign currency corrections," Mr. Hill said. "And a few tears for the last to get in and out."
For now, I think I'll sit out the negative-rate phenomenon. My simple United States dollar 15-year fixed-rate mortgage at 3 percent is looking pretty good.

Full text:   PARIS -- The eurozone economy expanded for a 22nd consecutive month in April, a private sector report showed on Thursday, but the modest pace of growth disappointed some analysts looking for more vigor resulting from the European Central Bank's bond-buying program.
Purchasing managers across the 19-member euro currency zone reported growth in services and manufacturing, according to a survey conducted by Markit Economics, a data analysis firm. Markit said its composite output index slipped to 53.5 in April from 54.0 in March. A reading below 50 indicates contraction, while a number above that level suggests expansion.
The market consensus had been for a small increase in the index. The lackluster report might reflect concerns about the economic crisis in Greece, though the figure was still close to an 11-month high, said Jessica Hinds, an economist in London with Capital Economics. She added that the April index level appeared consistent with quarterly economic growth of about 0.4 percent, or about 1.6 percent on an annualized basis.
Markit said the survey showed growth beyond France and Germany, the region's two biggest economies, at the fastest pace since August 2007. The data showed Germany slowing slightly from what remains a relatively good pace and France still just above stagnation levels.
The eurozone bottomed out in early 2013, but it has grown since then at a pace far too low to remove the slack from the economy. The jobless rate in the region stands at 11.3 percent, dragging on household spending and leaving businesses loath to invest. Complicating matters, Europe, like the United States and Japan, is suffering from historically low inflation, raising concern that the opposite phenomenon, deflation, will take hold.
The European Central Bank is seeking to stimulate the region's economy through its quantitative easing policy, under which it has committed to buying up to 60 billion euros, or about $64 billion, of bonds each month through September 2016.
The program has contributed to the optimism in some quarters by helping to push down the euro against the dollar, raising the competitiveness of European exporters against their foreign counterparts. Low oil prices have delivered what is in effect a stimulus to consumers.
"The euro area economy seems now to be turning the corner," Peter Praet, the central bank's chief economist, said on Thursday in a speech to a conference in Berlin. "Both the hard and soft data suggest that the activity is gathering momentum and looks set to strengthen over the course of this year."
Still, Mr. Praet warned that what is now occurring is "the beginnings of a cyclical recovery."
He added, "But it is not yet a structural one."

Activist Groups Are Increasingly Focused on Reparations for Genocide

Abstract: The Turkish authorities take the position that there is nothing that needs to be repaid.

Full text:   Behind the Turkish government's denials of the century-old Armenian genocide lurks the possibility that survivors and their descendants could be deemed legally entitled someday to financial reparations, perhaps worth tens of billions of dollars or more.
The Turkish authorities take the position that there is nothing that needs to be repaid. Moreover, no judicial mechanism exists in which claims of such magnitude, from events 100 years ago, could be litigated. But Armenian activists have nonetheless increasingly focused on the issue of compensation in recent years.
The activists have pressed smaller-scale lawsuits against Turkish and other defendants, in Turkey and elsewhere.
They have followed precedents set by victims of other atrocities of modern history, most notably Holocaust-era claims against Germany. They have drawn parallels between their struggle for reparations and those of Native Americans and African-Americans. They have commissioned studies to evaluate plundered and seized assets, including land that is now part of Turkey.
Many have also been energized by what they see as an increasing acknowledgment -- mainly outside Turkey but also among some Turks -- that from 1915 to 1923, in the tumult of World War I and the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, as many as 1.5 million Armenians were killed in a genocide committed by members of the generation that created the modern Turkish state.
"My parents and grandparents used to say, 'We'll never see justice done,' " said Nora Hovsepian, an American lawyer of Armenian descent from Encino, Calif., and the chairwoman of the Western Region of the Armenian National Committee of America, an advocacy group for the Armenian diaspora. With more international acceptance that genocide was committed, she said, "I think the tide is turning."
For human rights historians, the Turkish government's outrage at recent calls to acknowledge the genocide from Pope Francis, the European Parliament, Germany and Austria is intertwined with the reparations question. Such an acknowledgment by Turkey, such historians say, would not only reverse a century of denials, but would also weaken Turkey's legal defenses from compensation claims.
"If you deny something, it is not given existence by you," said Jermaine McCalpin, a scholar of transitional justice at the University of the West Indies in Jamaica. "If it's not given existence, there's nothing to resolve."
Mr. McCalpin, who was invited to deliver a speech on Friday at genocide centennial commemorations in Yerevan, the Armenian capital, served on an international panel that completed a large-scale study last month on calculating Armenian reparations.
He said the reparations question was challenging partly because the events happened so long ago. "But that doesn't mean we should do nothing," he said in a telephone interview.
"You're talking about a long historical trend of denial," Mr. McCalpin said of Turkey. "To admit or recognize a genocide also requires acknowledging a wrong, and that is where reparations come in. You acknowledge, and then you move to repair."
The study by the panel, the Armenian Genocide Reparations Study Group, was funded in part by Armenian advocacy organizations. It includes recommendations and formulas for determining the components of a possible reparations package, including inflation-adjusted compensation for property, death and suffering, based in part on historical precedents. Depending on the method of calculation, the total could exceed $100 billion.
The chairman of the panel, Henry C. Theriault, a genocide scholar and the chairman of the philosophy department at Worcester State University in Worcester, Mass., said the question of reparations was "obviously a pretty central one."
He also said an official Turkish acknowledgment of genocide, while not critical for reparation claims, was still important.
"It has symbolic value, for getting the history right," he said. "The fact that many people in Turkey aren't willing to use the word, the resistance to using it, doesn't promote reconciliation."
Other Armenian groups have said Mr. Theriault's panel vastly understated what was lost. Armenian Genocide Losses 1915, a website established by researchers in Armenia to estimate damages after the passing of 100 years, uses broader measures for calculating values, which are correspondingly higher than the panel's.
They include determinations for irreversible harm, such as death and destruction, and reversible harm, such as restoration of damaged churches, sea access, water and land resources, an apology and genocide education. They also include a calculation for "delay damages," which reflect deprivation of access to ancestral homelands and emotional distress.
Under the website's formulas, at least nine countries gained indirect benefits from the genocide, including the United States and much of present-day Europe. But Turkey gained more than any other, as "chief beneficiary and main cause of delay in proper redress of the crime."
The website estimated the total value of reparations at approximately $3 trillion, of which it said Turkey owes about $1.64 trillion.
Many Armenians, of course, say reparations on that scale are highly unlikely, even if Turkey were ever to concede that reconciliation should include financial compensation. But there is no indication Turkish leaders are prepared to discuss that possibility.
While the Turks have said atrocities were committed, they have denied that Armenians, almost all of them Christian, were intentionally and systematically killed because of their identity, part of the definition of genocide.
The Turks have also said that many Turkish Muslims were killed, and have sought to portray all victims of that period as regrettable casualties of conflict. And they have cited agreements made in the aftermath of World War I that were meant to settle claims and Ottoman-era debts.
"To undo these agreements would be unthinkable," said G. Lincoln McCurdy, president of the Turkish Coalition of America, an advocacy group in Washington.
"We would hope that Turkey and Armenia instead could look forward to reconciliation without the necessity of re-litigating venerable and time-honored agreements," Mr. McCurdy said in a statement. "And what about the losses of millions of Ottoman Muslims, who were driven out of their ancestral homes in the Balkans, the Caucasus and Russia and suffered during a century of war at the hands of the great powers and their proxies?"
Armenians have managed to win some money in the courts, though not from Turkey. In one well-known case, the New York Life Insurance Company was sued for refusing to pay the life insurance policies of thousands of Armenians who died in the genocide. The case, brought in California where many descendants of genocide victims live, was settled in 2004 for $20 million, plus $3 million for nine Armenian church and charity groups.
Last September, leading Armenian clerics announced they were suing Turkey in that country's highest court, seeking restitution for church properties destroyed during the genocide, notably the Great House of Cilicia in Sis, near the Turkish city of Adana. If the lawsuit fails, advocates say, an appeal is planned at the European Court of Human Rights.
Ms. Hovsepian said the focus on litigation to redress genocide losses partly reflected a generational shift in the Armenian diaspora, as many of the survivors have died and their children have taken up the cause in a less emotional and more pragmatic way.
"It's history passed down," she said. "Of course we still mourn the dead, but it goes beyond that. You can see the evolution. It's become a time of demands."

Full text:   The last couple of decades have been terrible for American workers without much education. New research calculates just how bad, and offers some evidence as to why that is.
In short, they face a double whammy. Less-educated Americans, especially men, are shifting away from manufacturing and other jobs that once offered higher pay, and a higher share are now working in lower-paying food service, cleaning and groundskeeping jobs. Simultaneously, pay levels are declining in almost all of the fields that employ less-educated workers, so even those who have held onto jobs as manufacturers, operators and laborers are making less than they would have a generation ago.
Perhaps the single most shocking number in a new review of employment and earnings data by researchers at the Hamilton Project, a research group within the Brookings Institution, is this one: The median earnings of working men aged 30 to 45 without a high school diploma fell 20 percent from 1990 to 2013 when adjusted for inflation.
A group of people not earning much to begin with, in other words, has seen earnings plummet to $25,500 in 2013 from $31,900 in 1990 (both numbers are in 2013 dollars). Men with a high school diploma did only a little better, with a 13 percent decline in median earnings over the same span. Women did better than men, but it has been no era of riches for less-educated women either; those without a high school diploma saw a 12 percent decline in median earnings, and those with a high school diploma or some college a 3 percent gain.
The difficulties of American workers, and especially those with low levels of education, have been well documented. What makes the latest analysis, by Melissa S. Kearney, Brad Hershbein and Elisa Jácome, interesting is in some ways its simplicity. They focused on a slice of census data that avoids some of the more contentious dimensions of these debates.
They are using data over a relatively long period, 23 years, that includes three recessions and three recoveries, so the results should be little affected by exactly where we stand within the economic cycle. They focus on people between ages 30 and 45, so the numbers shouldn't be much affected if people choose to stay in school longer or retire earlier. They focus only on those who worked at least 750 hours during the year, sidestepping the debate over whether millions of Americans who have left the work force are doing so voluntarily or because they don't think there are good job opportunities available to them.
There are two common stories for why this has been such a hard couple of decades for less-educated American workers.
First, there is the decline of the number of jobs in manufacturing and other industries that once paid less-skilled workers good wages, a result of technology and globalization. Second, there are changing norms around worker pay and the workplace -- less union power, for example, a lower minimum wage when adjusted for inflation, and a culture in corporate America of cutting labor costs to the bone.
It would be dangerous to read too much into a relatively simple crunching of census data, but the Hamilton Project numbers offer some evidence for both.
First, there really is a shift away from the sectors where less-educated workers can earn a decent living. In 1990, 40 percent of the prime-age male workers without a high school degree worked as operators and laborers, a number that declined to 34 percent in 2013. Jobs in food service, cleaning and groundskeeping nearly doubled in the same span, to 21 percent from 11 percent. But it wasn't an even trade: Pay for operators and labors was $25,500 in 2013, compared with $20,400 for the food, cleaning and groundskeeping category.
You're not imagining it. The jobs that are being created for less-educated workers really do pay less than the ones that are being lost. That suggests that globalization and technological change -- the shifts that are making those machine operator jobs fewer and farther between -- are a factor in depressed wages.
But the shift in occupational categories, the researchers found, accounts for only about a third of the decline in pay for men without a high school degree and one-sixth of the decline for those with a degree. A bigger effect is downward pressure on pay in jobs held by low-education workers across the board.
So not only did people shift from higher-paying fields to lower-paying ones, but inflation-adjusted pay also fell in all of those jobs. For example, production work -- manufacturing, largely -- was the highest-paying category for men without a high school diploma in 2013, paying them $28,000. But that sector was both smaller (29 percent of such workers, down from 31 percent) and paid less (down from $33,600) than it did in 1990.
The drop in pay across the board for low-education workers hints more at some of those factors around employers' bargaining power and practices. Both factors could come into play, though. For example, perhaps a rise in automation and globalization is eliminating manufacturing jobs, and the people who once held those jobs are now competing for work as janitors and food preparers, and the additional supply is helping to depress wages in those fields.
"One thing that's always bothered me about the political debate is people want to say either it's globalization and technology, or it's institutions," said Ms. Kearney, who is director of the Hamilton Project and a professor at the University of Maryland. "But of course it's both."

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Democrats in Congress are uniting around a proposal to raise the federal minimum wage to $12 an hour.
Within the next several days, Senator Patty Murray, the top Democrat on the Senate committee that deals with labor issues, plans to introduce a bill to increase the minimum wage, in steps, from its current level of $7.25 to $12 by 2020.
The measure has little chance of passing the Republican-controlled Congress in the near future, but it is the latest indication of Democrats' rising ambitions for lifting the wage floor, an issue with considerable popular support in an era of increasing income inequality. The party is determined to elevate the issue in next year's congressional and presidential elections.
Senator Murray's forthcoming bill, and a companion measure by Representative Robert C. Scott in the House, have considerable support within the party, according to congressional aides. Among the 15 to 20 Democrats who already back the effort in the Senate are Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, and Charles E. Schumer of New York, his chosen successor.
"The politics, substance and morality coincide to make it a winner issue for us in 2016," Senator Schumer said. "It appeals not just to the people who would benefit," he added. "Polling data shows it appeals to middle-class people, people of high income."
The speed with which Democrats and activists have strengthened their demands for minimum-wage hikes poses some complications for both the White House, which has yet to take a position on the Murray plan, and for Hillary Rodham Clinton, who in response to last week's national protests by low-wage workers wrote on Twitter: "Fast food & child care workers shouldn't have to march in streets for living wages."
Mrs. Clinton has a long record of supporting minimum-wage increases, but her recently begun presidential campaign has preferred to ease into revealing the details of her policy positions, the minimum wage included.
Whatever the challenges the minimum-wage issue presents for prominent Democrats, however, they pale in comparison to those facing the Republican Party, where support for even the current minimum wage is tepid. A January 2014 poll by the Pew Research Center showed that 73 percent of Americans, including 53 percent of Republicans, supported raising the minimum wage to $10.10.
"In a deeply polarized country, the minimum wage is one of a small handful of issues that gets broad bipartisan support," wrote Daniel H. Pfeiffer, who until recently was a senior adviser to President Obama, in an email in response to questions. "The Republican problem of opposing the minimum wage grows much worse when paired with their support of tax cuts for the wealthy and large corporations. The 30-second ad writes itself."
To defuse the support, Republicans and pro-business groups have highlighted the potential job losses that could arise from minimum-wage increases. If "you just ask if people support a higher minimum wage, people support it," said Michael Saltsman, research director of the business-backed Employment Policies Institute. "What's interesting to me is when you have a follow-up question and walk them through the consequences, support really falls."
A growing body of economic research suggests that moderate increases in the minimum wage would cause little or no job losses. An increase to $12 an hour spread out over the next few years, which would roughly restore the minimum wage to its purchasing power in the late 1960s, falls in this range, according to Jared Bernstein, who served as economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.
But moving substantially beyond that could lead to more significant job losses, particularly in low-wage regions of the country, said Mr. Bernstein.
The Senate bill would raise the minimum wage to $8 an hour in 2016, then in $1 annual increments until 2020. Thereafter, it would rise in line with the growth in median wages, which typically increase more rapidly than the inflation measure used in Social Security and other federal programs to adjust for changes in the cost of living.
Perhaps the most far-reaching element of the bill is its gradual elimination of a separate minimum wage for workers who receive tips, like waiters, which currently stands at $2.13. "This is historic, truly historic," said Saru Jayaraman, co-director of Restaurant Opportunities Centers United and a leading activist on the issue.
According to Ms. Jayaraman, the practice of paying substantially lower wages to tipped workers dates back to the post-Civil War era, when dining establishments and railroads hired freed slaves to work for tips and nothing else.
Senator Murray's effort comes at a time of increasing momentum around the country behind changes to the minimum wage. Even some conservative states, including Arkansas, South Dakota and Alaska, raised their wage minimums by referendum last year.
And since the beginning of 2015, large employers like Walmart, Target and McDonald's have increased their companywide minimum wage to near or above $10 per hour.
Last week, tens of thousands of fast-food and other low-wage workers protested in over 200 American cities in favor of a $15 an hour minimum wage.
As the energy behind the movement has escalated, Democrats have become more ambitious about what they might ultimately achieve, despite continuing Republican opposition.
President Obama proposed an increase to $9 an hour in his 2013 State of the Union speech, then bumped his proposal to $10.10 by the fall of that year.
In 2014, the Seattle City Council voted to raise the local minimum wage to $15 an hour over a period of several years, while Chicago's moderate Democratic mayor, Rahm Emanuel, a former chief of staff to President Obama, helped win an increase of the city's minimum wage to $13 by 2019.
"That momentum helped raise the awareness that there's something we can do rather than 'Gosh, let's put our head down because it might get defeated,' " Senator Murray said.
Activists say that her forthcoming legislation effectively becomes the baseline, among Democrats, for the smallest acceptable increase in the minimum wage heading into the 2016 political season.
In a sign that the $12 figure could define the lower end of the debate within the party, Senator Bernard Sanders, independent of Vermont, one of the chamber's more liberal members, held a rally with low-wage workers on Capitol Hill on Wednesday to lift pay for employees of federal contractors to at least $15 an hour.
"Pretty much anyone who enters the 2016 cycle not at least talking about $12 an hour is way behind the times," said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, a grass-roots organizing group with nearly one million members. "It's the equivalent of entering 2016 talking about civil unions."

Full text:   MOSCOW -- Prime Minister Dmitri A. Medvedev said on Tuesday that sanctions imposed on Russia over its annexation of the Crimean Peninsula had done "meaningful" harm to the economy, but that it was a price worth paying.
In an annual statement to Parliament, Mr. Medvedev estimated that Russia's economy had lost $26.8 billion because of low oil prices and sanctions introduced by the European Union and the United States last year. In his speech, Mr. Medvedev said that Russia's economy had shrunk by 2 percent in the first quarter of 2015.
"The losses from the introduced limitations have been serious for our economy, and we are not going to hide that," he said during a televised speech to lawmakers.
Mr. Medvedev said that the economy had "stabilized," although he added that future sanctions could slow Russia's recovery. Nonetheless, he said that the cost to the economy was justified.
"The unprecedented external political and economic pressure is the price we have to pay for our position," Mr. Medvedev said. "But everyone, the authorities and our society, realized that no matter the cost, we had no other way."
Mr. Medvedev's remarks echoed statements last week by President Vladimir V. Putin, who portrayed Russia's economy as battered but stable. In a nationally televised question-and-answer session that lasted nearly four hours, Mr. Putin told Russians that the worst of the crisis was over and that the economy would most likely recover within two years.
In his televised appearance, Mr. Putin spent an unusual amount of time on the domestic economy, a sign of national concern over the issue.
The ruble had lost 50 percent of its value against the dollar when it ended its slide in December, prompting Russians to rush to buy consumer goods as inflation hit. The ruble has rebounded 30 percent since then.
Mr. Medvedev said on Tuesday that Russians should not expect the ruble to weaken again as it did in December, but that the currency would probably not return to its previous position.
"Our currency is strengthening, which is good for a number of sectors, but it reduces opportunities for export," Mr. Medvedev said. "We are interested in a predictable exchange rate, so that the ruble neither weakens nor strengthens too fast."

Full text:   CLAREMONT, N.H. -- In her first week as a 2016 presidential candidate, Hillary Rodham Clinton seemed to channel another high-profile Democrat. "The deck is stacked in their favor," Mrs. Clinton said of the wealthy and powerful. "My job is to reshuffle the cards."
The line echoed a phrase that helped make Senator Elizabeth Warren the populist icon of her party. "The game is rigged," Ms. Warren often says. "Rigged to work for those who have money and power."
Before that, there was Mrs. Clinton's tribute to Ms. Warren in Time magazine. "She never hesitates to hold powerful people's feet to the fire," Mrs. Clinton wrote in the issue honoring the top 100 influential people.
For anyone who wondered what kind of economic message Mrs. Clinton would deliver in her campaign, the first few days made it clear: She is embracing the ideas trumpeted by Ms. Warren and the populist movement -- that the wealthy have been benefiting disproportionately from the economy while the middle class and the poor have been left behind. And the policies Mrs. Clinton is advancing, like paid sick leave for employees and an increase in the minimum wage, align with that emphasis.
But now, the former secretary of state must persuade voters that she is the right messenger for the cause of inequality, not simply seizing on it out of political expedience.
Nothing stings members of her inner circle more than the suggestion that their candidate is late to these issues. Mrs. Clinton was the original Elizabeth Warren, her advisers say, a populist fighter who for decades has been an advocate for families and children; only now have the party and primary voters caught up.
"I don't know why we have this semicollective amnesia about her past positions," said Neera Tanden, the president of the Center for American Progress and Mrs. Clinton's policy director in 2008. "She's following no one on these issues."
But affirming Mrs. Clinton's sincerity as a populist, especially given her reputation for caution and careful consideration of political moves, is proving an uphill battle. The assessment by Bloomberg Politics after Mrs. Clinton's first campaign stops was that she is "terrified of the left."
It is easy to forget that for years, Mrs. Clinton weathered criticism that she was too liberal, the socialist foil to her husband's centrist agenda. Economists in the Clinton administration referred to the first lady and her aides as "the Bolsheviks."
In Mrs. Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign, she positioned herself as the populist candidate to the left of Barack Obama on several economic issues, angering some of her Wall Street donors and earning broad support among organized labor and working-class voters.
Advisers have lists at the ready outlining Mrs. Clinton's calls as early as 2007 to eliminate the so-called carried interest loophole, roll back the Bush-era tax cuts for the wealthy, impose tighter regulations on derivatives and place limits on chief executives' compensation.
"Let's finally do something about the growing economic inequality that is tearing our country apart," Mrs. Clinton said during her campaign, appearing at the Take Back America conference, a gathering of liberal groups, in June 2007. "The top 1 percent of our households," she added, "held 22 percent of our nation's wealth."
"Enough with the corporate welfare," she continued. "Enough with the golden parachutes. And enough with the tax incentives for companies to shift jobs overseas."
A 16-page dossier, titled "Hillary Clinton: A Lifetime Champion of Income Opportunity" and assembled by a close friend and adviser to Mrs. Clinton, calls Ms. Warren a "footnote." The document, provided to The New York Times, presents 40 instances in which Mrs. Clinton took the same stance as Ms. Warren on issues -- like organized labor and tax increases on the wealthy -- in some cases years before the senator's ascent in the national spotlight.
But that was then, and this is now, when everything Mrs. Clinton does will be viewed through the lens of a party under the influence of Ms. Warren and her blistering critique of the financial sector.
Robert B. Reich, a secretary of labor during the Clinton administration who has advised Mrs. Clinton's campaign, said the comparison with Ms. Warren "personalizes it far too much."
"This is a broad-based movement to take back our democracy and make the economy work for everybody instead of a small group at the top," he said.
For seven years, Mrs. Clinton has been out of domestic policy, and in that time, the populist movement has caught fire. In the years Mrs. Clinton served as secretary of state and since she left the State Department in early 2013, she has become more associated with the centrist policies of the Bill Clinton years than with policies of raising taxes on the wealthy and increasing government services that have become widely adopted on the left.
"This perception comes because she wasn't involved in the discussion for so long," Anita Dunn, a Democratic strategist, said of Mrs. Clinton. Because, she added, in the White House "she had this reputation as being the very left-wing, liberal, Elizabeth Warren type."
During the same period when Mrs. Clinton was absent from domestic debates, the policies of the Bill Clinton years were recast.
In her 2008 campaign, Mrs. Clinton cited the prosperity of the 1990s. Today, the trade deals, Wall Street deregulation and deficit reduction that Mr. Clinton oversaw are often blamed as contributing to the divide between a tiny sliver of the wealthiest and the vast majority of Americans.
"I remember when Bill Clinton was running in 1992 and his line was 'putting people first,' " said Dean Baker, an economist and a director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research. "He just didn't follow through on that," and instead emphasized deficit reduction and trade deals, he added.
On Friday, Mrs. Clinton subtly distanced herself from the trade policies associated with the 1990s. In response to a trade agreement reached Thursday by Republican and Democratic leaders, her spokesman, Nick Merrill, said Mrs. Clinton believed that any trade deal should protect American workers, raise wages and create jobs in the United States.
"The goal is greater prosperity and security for American families, not trade for trade's sake," Mr. Merrill said in a statement.
Mrs. Clinton will begin to present more specific policy proposals next month. In the meantime, she has expressed support for an increase in the minimum wage, paid family medical leave and the closing of corporate tax loopholes.
In a meeting with economists this year, Mrs. Clinton intensely studied a chart that showed income inequality in the United States. The graph charted how real wages, adjusted for inflation, had increased exponentially for the wealthiest Americans, making the bar so steep it hardly fit on the chart.
Mrs. Clinton pointed at the top category and said the economy required a "toppling" of the wealthiest 1 percent, according to several people who were briefed on her policy discussions but could not discuss private conversations for attribution.
Still, Mrs. Clinton will pitch that "toppling" with a very different style from Ms. Warren, a bankruptcy expert whose populist message has been laser-focused on holding Wall Street accountable. Mrs. Clinton will present proposals for changes in the tax code as a way of also investing in education, infrastructure and communities.
Mrs. Clinton "wakes up asking how she can accomplish real things for families, not who she can attack," said Gene B. Sperling, an economic adviser in the Clinton and Obama administrations. He added, "When she shows that fighting populist edge, it is for a purpose."

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDED. TEHRAN -- Wearing business suits set off with sneakers, the American executives trailed a young guide along the narrow sidewalks of the capital of Iran, once branded by the United States as part of the "Axis of Evil."
Their destination was one of Tehran's most luxurious restaurants, where Iranian officials and business consultants greeted the visitors with open arms and the Pharrell Williams song "Happy" blasted from the sound system.
"Everybody loves us here," said Ned Lamont, a digital services entrepreneur and former politician, holding a glass of carrot juice offered by one of his hosts.
Just as the Obama administration and Congress were wrangling over details of a nuclear agreement with Iran last week, the group of 24 executives were touring the country on a fact-finding mission.
Of course, the organizers rushed to explain, this was by no means a business delegation.
"We are tourists," said Dick Simon, a member of the Young Presidents' Organization, a network of business executives. "But naturally many in our company have the potential of getting involved here, as they lead some very significant businesses," he said, referring to his fellow travelers.
American companies are barred from doing business in Iran, which remains under a regimen of sanctions aimed at pressuring the country to curtail its nuclear program. The sanctions, which cover financial transactions as well as a host of industries like petroleum and shipping, have put a stranglehold on the Iranian economy, which is struggling with inflation and shortages of food and consumer goods.
With the United States and Iran currently negotiating a nuclear deal under which those sanctions would eventually be lifted, some American companies are now hoping for new business opportunities in a country that has long been off limits.
The visit to Iran by the American group, which included venture capitalists and business executives from a range of industries, including real estate, health care and insurance, was organized by individual members of the Young Presidents' Organization. Last week's trip was the group's third to the Islamic republic.
"There was a waiting list. The prospect of a changing Iran is very interesting," Mr. Simon said.
At the function Thursday night, the delegates sat at tables decorated with cards marked with topics of conversation: "Real Estate," "Diplomacy," "Luxury" and "ICT," for information and communications technology. The women in the group wore head scarves, as is obligatory in Iran.
"I should be at 'ICT,' I think," said Mr. Lamont, whose Connecticut-based company provides video and data services to college campuses, "but I think the 'Diplomacy' table will be more interesting for now."
Mr. Lamont and the others in the group arrived in Tehran last week after touring ancient sites near Shiraz, a city in the south, under the watchful eyes of government minders.
"They don't want us to get in any sorts of trouble, or have an incident, but we have been mostly free to go around," said Mr. Lamont, who like other members of the group was bubbling with enthusiasm over the hospitality of their Iranian hosts.
In the Shiite holy city of Qum, the group sat down with a reform-minded ayatollah who told them that Iran was on the verge of major change.
"I asked, what about the 'Death to America' slogan?" Mr. Lamont said, referring to the phrase that appears on many banners across the country and has long been shouted at public demonstrations. But the cleric responded that the slogan was from a different era. "He told us, 'This is the new Iran,' " Mr. Lamont said. "Such messages are hopeful and different."
At the restaurant on Thursday, Cyrus Razzaghi, a prominent Iranian business consultant, and other speakers extolled the potential of the Iranian economy for adventurous American investors.
"In the end these are not normal tourists of course, they are wealthy, powerful and influential Americans," Mr. Razzaghi said. "Besides from giving them a taste of Iranian culture, I felt they would also be interested in Iran's huge market."
Iran's deputy minister of telecommunications, Nasrollah Jahangard, peppered the audience with statistics, saying Iran was one of the most connected countries in the region.
"The number of smartphones is expected to be doubled to 40 million on a population of nearly 80 million," he said. "We have 3G running and 4G networks under development; we are moving forward fast," Mr. Jahangard said in English.
His words seemed to pique the interest of some of the executives. Christopher Schroeder, a venture capitalist, said he saw some promise in the country's technology sector. "I have met with young women who are running Iran's versions of Amazon and Groupon. They could really get somewhere in the future."
However, it was clear from the questions about the economy and the influence of hard-liners that many obstacles remain.
"When I look out of that window," said Richard Cohen, a New York-based real estate developer, pointing at the Tehran skyline, "I see 18 cranes. Only one is working. I have never seen so many unfinished high-rises in my life. What does that symbolize?"
Since 1995, sanctions have barred Americans from doing business in Iran, where a substantial middle class represents a potentially lucrative market for foreign companies. Hopes that the nuclear framework agreement made on April 2 might lead to a broader deal by the end of June have raised expectations of an opening of the Iranian market. Still, most companies are waiting for a final deal before seriously considering investing here.
"Fact is, now we are not even allowed to," Mr. Simon said.
Despite the recent talks between Iran and the United States and the prospect of better relations, Iran's revolutionary ardor was still visible.
In Shiraz, at the tomb of King Cyrus, a major tourist destination, the group passed a billboard bearing a quote by Iran's first supreme leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
"The world should know that all Iran and Muslims' problems are due to the politics of aliens and of the USA. Muslims generally hate aliens and specially the USA," it reads in English.
The executives, however, said they were struck by the warm reception they had received in Iran.
"All in all it seems to me the Iranians really want to reconnect with the world," said Jennifer Adams Baldock, a former executive in the printing industry. "They want to move on."
Correction: April 23, 2015, Thursday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Because of an editing error, the Tehran Journal article on Monday, about a visit to Iran by American executives who hope the lifting of economic sanctions will open up business opportunities there, misstated the role of one of the visitors, Dick Simon, in the Young Presidents' Organization, a business network whose members organized the trip. Mr. Simon is a member of the group, not a co-founder.

Full text:   With rising income inequality in the United States, you might expect more and more people to conclude that it's time to soak the rich. Here's a puzzle, though: Over the last several decades, close to the opposite has happened.
Since the 1970s, middle-class incomes have been stagnant in inflation-adjusted terms, while the wealthy have done very well; inequality of wealth and income has risen.
Over that same period, though, Americans' views on whether the government should work to redistribute income -- to tax the rich, for example, and funnel the proceeds to the poor and working class -- have, depending on which survey answers you look at, either been little changed, or shifted toward greater skepticism about redistribution.
In other words, Americans' desire to soak the rich has diminished even as the rich have more wealth available that could, theoretically, be soaked.
It's not just public opinion polls, either. It shows up in the actual policies espoused by candidates for office and enacted by Congress. In 1980, the highest earning Americans faced a 70 percent tax on every dollar they earned beyond $215,400 for a married couple, for example, the equivalent of $544,000 today.
Over the last decade, by contrast, the top marginal rate has ranged between 35 percent (which President George W. Bush secured in 2003) and 39.6 percent (which President Obama advocated and which took effect in 2013).
This core question -- How much should the government use its power to tax and spend to redistribute wealth in pursuit of a more equal society? -- has been at the root of ideological clashes around the world and throughout history. Yet in American politics in recent years, it has manifested itself in a narrow, partisan debate over whether the top marginal income tax rate should be 35 percent or 39.6 percent.
How you make sense of this seeming paradox of rising inequality and flat or declining support for redistribution depends on your ideological assumptions.
If you're conservative, a compelling answer might be this: Americans are seeking less redistribution because they have come to their senses. They realized the very high tax rates and generous social spending that prevailed in the middle decades of the 20th century came at a high economic cost, and that low taxes on the rich encouraged greater investment and entrepreneurship, spurring faster economic growth that ultimately made everybody better off. (The economists Glenn Hubbard and Tim Kane have made a version of that argument.)
If you're a liberal, the answer might be more like this: Americans have been hoodwinked by conservative politicians and media outlets, and have come to view redistribution as a dirty word because they don't recognize the ways it benefits them. This barrage of misinformation has led them to view any redistributive efforts as welfare that goes to somebody else, particularly to someone with a different color skin. (Paul Krugman has made a version of that argument.)
New research offers a bit more evidence on what may be occurring. It doesn't disprove either the conventional liberal or conservative argument. But it does show some of the ways that Americans' attitudes toward redistribution are more complex than either would suggest.
A National Bureau of Economic Research working paper by Jimmy Charité, Raymond Fisman and Ilyana Kuziemko tackled this with an online experiment in which a random sampling of Americans were asked what tax rate they thought appropriate for someone whose annual income had suddenly increased by $250,000 for reasons involving luck. The researchers asked the question twice. In one version, the income gain occurred in the current year; in the other, it happened five years ago. Surprisingly, the respondents favored a 1.7 percentage point higher tax rate if the person with the income gain had recently started earning the extra money than if the person had been earning it for five years. That may not sound like much, but it is more than half of the gap the same experiment showed between the tax rate favored by Obama voters and the rate favored by those who said they voted for Mitt Romney in 2012.
In other words, respondents favored less redistribution if they believed that the person had already grown accustomed to a higher income. The psychology seems to be something like this: Rich people who have been rich for a while have gotten used to their money, so it would be unfair to tax them heavily. But people who have just gotten rich have not become accustomed to higher levels of after-tax income, so it wouldn't be as harmful to raise their taxes in the interest of greater equality.
Another working paper, from the Brookings Papers on Economic Activity by Vivekinan Ashok, Ms. Kuziemko and Ebonya Washington, looks at how thinking about redistribution has varied over time among groups. One of its more striking conclusions: The shift away from a belief in redistribution has been stronger among older Americans than any other age group.
Might this be explained by the elderly becoming more conservative in general, and therefore taking a more conservative view on this issue? Not really. The shift showed up even when the researchers controlled for views on hot-button social issues like abortion and gun control.
The researchers offer another way of making sense of the pattern: Older Americans benefit more directly than any other age group from the social safety net, specifically, Social Security and Medicare. The fact that American seniors already receive government-provided health care may make them view any talk of greater redistribution as taking away what they already have, the researchers suggest.
During the debate over President Obama's health care overhaul, this thread was often evident; with opinion polls showing that older Americans opposed the law more than younger people did. At the same time, conservative politicians and commentators pummeled the law for cutting Medicare spending to help pay for expanded coverage for younger Americans.
The two studies indicate how complex -- even messy -- opinions on this question of political philosophy are. Our views on proper tax levels and redistribution may be shaped by seemingly extraneous factors, like whether we believe the rich are already used to being rich, and whether we are already getting government benefits.
In other words, the question isn't, Why don't Americans want to soak the rich more? It may be, Who exactly is being counted as rich and who is perceived to be benefiting from the soaking?

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Consumer prices in the United States increased for a second straight month in March on rising gasoline and housing costs.
The Labor Department said on Friday that its Consumer Price Index increased 0.2 percent last month in broad-based price gains after a similar increase in February. In the 12 months through March, the index slipped 0.1 percent after being unchanged in February.
The so-called core C.P.I., which strips out food and energy costs, increased 0.2 percent in March after a similar rise in February. In the 12 months through March, the core C.P.I. rose 1.8 percent, the largest increase since October.
The economy appears set to rebound from a soft patch in the first quarter. In a separate report, the University of Michigan said its consumer sentiment index jumped to 95.9 this month from a reading of 93 in March.
That bodes well for consumer spending and the overall economy, which stumbled at the start of the year under the weight of a harsh winter, a resurgent dollar, weaker global growth and a labor dispute at West Coast ports, which has been settled.
The rise in inflation, however, may be limited by the strong dollar, which has gained 13 percent against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners since last June.
Economists estimate the dollar could shave half a percentage point off inflation and economic growth this year. Firming wage growth, however, could mitigate the dollar's impact on inflation.
"But if the core rate is that close to target when it is being constrained by the indirect impact of lower energy prices and the stronger dollar, how high could it get when those transitory effects fade next year?" said Paul Ashworth, chief United States economist at Capital Economics in New York.
Last month, gasoline prices rose 3.9 percent, the largest gain since February 2013, after increasing 2.4 percent in February. Food prices slipped 0.2 percent last month, the biggest drop since May 2013.
Elsewhere, shelter costs rose 0.3 percent. That, together with higher energy prices, accounted for much of the gain in the index last month.
Further gains in the cost of shelter are probable in the months ahead, given rising demand for rental accommodation.
There were increases in prices of new motor vehicles, used cars and trucks and medical care services. Prices for apparel items and household furnishings and operations also rose. Airline fares fell 1.7 percent.

Full text:   Signs of complacency were evident before stock markets around the world tumbled on Friday.
European shares have been on a tear this year, even with Greece seemingly edging closer to default. Doubts about China's economy did not stop its stocks from more than doubling in the last 12 months. The United States market has been lukewarm this year, but the excitement seemed back on Thursday, after three companies carried out initial stock public offerings that rose sharply on their first day of trading.
But the good times evaporated on Friday. The day's moves weren't large by recent standards, but the global nature of the swoon gave traders and analysts pause. The benchmark Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 23.81, or 1.1 percent, to close at 2,081.18.
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 279.47 points, or 1.5 percent, to close at 17,826.30. At one point in the day, it was down as much as 357 points. The Dow is more or less flat for the year and down about 2.5 percent from the high, not adjusted for inflation, that it reached last month. The Nasdaq composite index fell 75.98, or 1.5 percent, to 4,931.81.
Chinese stock futures, which allow traders to bet on future movements in shares, plunged on Friday. The sell-off occurred after Chinese market regulators on Friday announced changes that could restrict the supply of loans that investors use to finance stock trades and increase the amount of negative bets against Chinese stocks.
A technical issue also agitated traders. There was a failure of about two and a half hours on Bloomberg terminals, the computers that banks and investment firms around the world rely on for many financial activities.
Germany's DAX index declined 2.58 percent. Adding a chill to the market on Friday, the yield on the 10-year German government bond fell to 0.08 percent.
Investors flock to German government bonds during periods of nervousness, making people willing to accept such low returns. The yield on the United States 10-year Treasury note, another safe haven investment, fell to 1.87 percent from 1.90 late Thursday.
Some analysts said the markets had looked vulnerable to a sell-off.
As shares have risen, the valuations on companies have become more expensive, which can make investors less likely to hold them if earnings disappoint. Volatility in the markets has also dropped in recent weeks, suggesting that investors thought that the outlook for stocks and bonds was predictable.
"If there is a news item, the market reacts because of this vulnerability," Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, said.
Plenty of challenges remain for investors.
One hurdle, Mr. Paulsen said, is an increase in interest rates by the Federal Reserve. The Fed is expected to raise rates this year, which could prompt investors to take a more cautious view of the markets. Inflation numbers released on Friday contained signs that prices have continued to rise this year, which may prompt the Fed to increase rates sooner.
Greece's clashes over its debts with other European leaders are not likely to disappear. If Greece were to default and drop out of the euro, global markets might be in for a period of strong turbulence. But even if the country strikes a deal, it may be weeks before an agreement is forged.
The United States market may be able to absorb bad news out of Europe if American companies report strong earnings. Large banks, JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs included, reported impressive first-quarter results this week.
General Electric, which announced last week that it was going to scale back its lending businesses sharply, reported results on Friday that showed that its industrial operations were performing solidly. Shares of G.E. fell 3 cents, or 0.1 percent, to $27.25, despite the market sell-off.
But shares of American Express fell 4.4 percent on Friday after the company reported earnings on Thursday after the markets closed.
The distress over the red ink on Friday was in stark contrast to the applause that greeted the dazzling debuts of three companies on the United States stock market on Thursday.
Those companies, Etsy, an online marketplace for artisanal products; Virtu Financial, a high-frequency trading firm; and Party City, a party supplies company, all traded substantially higher on Thursday. On Friday, the stocks of Virtu and Party City rose. But Etsy shares fell 8.1 percent.

Abstract: Some readers may recall that there was much scoffing at predictions from Keynesian economists, myself included, that interest rates would stay low despite huge budget deficits; that inflation would remain subdued despite huge bond purchases by the Fed; that sharp cuts in government spending, far from unleashing a confidence-driven boom in private spending, would cause private spending to fall further.

Full text:   BRUSSELS -- America has yet to achieve a full recovery from the effects of the 2008 financial crisis. Still, it seems fair to say that we've made up much, though by no means all, of the lost ground.
But you can't say the same about the eurozone, where real G.D.P. per capita is still lower than it was in 2007, and 10 percent or more below where it was supposed to be by now. This is worse than Europe's track record during the 1930s.
Why has Europe done so badly? In the past few weeks, I've seen a number of speeches and articles suggesting that the problem lies in the inadequacy of our economic models -- that we need to rethink macroeconomic theory, which has failed to offer useful policy guidance in the crisis. But is this really the story?
No, it isn't. It's true that few economists predicted the crisis. The clean little secret of economics since then, however, is that basic textbook models, reflecting an approach to recessions and recoveries that would have seemed familiar to students half a century ago, have performed very well. The trouble is that policy makers in Europe decided to reject those basic models in favor of alternative approaches that were innovative, exciting and completely wrong.
I've been revisiting economic policy debates since 2008, and what stands out from around 2010 onward is the huge divergence in thinking that emerged between the United States and Europe. In America, the White House and the Federal Reserve mainly stayed faithful to standard Keynesian economics. The Obama administration wasted a lot of time and effort pursuing a so-called Grand Bargain on the budget, but it continued to believe in the textbook proposition that deficit spending is actually a good thing in a depressed economy. Meanwhile, the Fed ignored ominous warnings that it was "debasing the dollar," sticking with the view that its low-interest-rate policies wouldn't cause inflation as long as unemployment remained high.
In Europe, by contrast, policy makers were ready and eager to throw textbook economics out the window in favor of new approaches. The European Commission, headquartered here in Brussels, eagerly seized upon supposed evidence for "expansionary austerity," rejecting the conventional case for deficit spending in favor of the claim that slashing spending in a depressed economy actually creates jobs, because it boosts confidence. Meanwhile, the European Central Bank took inflation warnings to heart and raised interest rates in 2011 even though unemployment was still very high.
But while European policy makers may have imagined that they were showing a praiseworthy openness to new economic ideas, the economists they chose to listen to were those telling them what they wanted to hear. They sought justifications for the harsh policies they were determined, for political and ideological reasons, to impose on debtor nations; they lionized economists, like Harvard's Alberto Alesina, Carmen Reinhart, and Kenneth Rogoff, who seemed to offer that justification. As it turned out, however, all that exciting new research was deeply flawed, one way or another.
And while new ideas were crashing and burning, that old-time economics was going from strength to strength. Some readers may recall that there was much scoffing at predictions from Keynesian economists, myself included, that interest rates would stay low despite huge budget deficits; that inflation would remain subdued despite huge bond purchases by the Fed; that sharp cuts in government spending, far from unleashing a confidence-driven boom in private spending, would cause private spending to fall further. But all these predictions came true.
The point is that it's wrong to claim, as many do, that policy failed because economic theory didn't provide the guidance policy makers needed. In reality, theory provided excellent guidance, if only policy makers had been willing to listen. Unfortunately, they weren't.
And they still aren't. If you want to feel really depressed about Europe's future, read the Op-Ed article by Wolfgang Schäuble, the German finance minister, that was published Wednesday by The Times. It's a flat-out rejection of everything we know about macroeconomics, of all the insights that European experience these past five years confirms. In Mr. Schäuble's world, austerity leads to confidence, confidence creates growth, and, if it's not working for your country, it's because you're not doing it right.
But back to the question of new ideas and their role in policy. It's hard to argue against new ideas in general. In recent years, however, innovative economic ideas, far from helping to provide a solution, have been part of the problem. We would have been far better off if we had stuck to that old-time macroeconomics, which is looking better than ever.

Full text:   MOSCOW -- Sounding at times like a mayor promising to fix potholes and close noisy bars, President Vladimir V. Putin used his annual national call-in show on Thursday to try to reassure Russians that the country's economic troubles were under control and that he shared their concerns on pocketbook issues.
If his marathon session in 2014 trumpeted the annexation of Crimea and issues of national pride, this year Mr. Putin fielded questions from across Russia on issues like dairy cow production, small-business loans and the rising price of car insurance.
Mr. Putin tried to paint an overall rosy picture of the economy, noting that the ruble had stabilized and strengthened even if inflation was over 11 percent. (Trading for as low as 80 to the dollar in December and volatile all winter, the ruble has risen to about 50; it was at 34 a year ago.)
"Experts see that we have passed the peak of the problems," he said. "Nothing burst and everything works."
Mr. Putin promised to help dairy farmers get better distribution and prices for their milk; told unpaid workers at the new national space launch center that they would receive back pay; and vowed not to lower public wages nationally even if his economic advisers pressed.
The questions came from reporters interviewing Russians in various corners of the country, the studio audience, callers and various forms of social media. The broadcasters said they had received more than three million questions, a record. Mr. Putin responded to roughly 70, and about half of them focused on the state of the economy.
Mr. Putin said he had not heard that trucks trying to get onto the single ferry to Crimea often waited in line for two weeks. (It was notable that the first mention of Crimea, annexed by Russia from Ukraine last year, came about three hours and 40 minutes into the program.)
When a weeping woman was interviewed from an area of Siberia devastated by wildfires this week, Mr. Putin spontaneously promised thousands of dollars to every family who had lost a loved one or property.
Foreign policy issues did enter into the discussion, but the first question did not come until an hour into the program. And Mr. Putin repeated many of Russia's earlier positions.
The S-300 air defense system he had announced this week that Russia would deliver to Iran was a sale voluntarily suspended in 2010, he said, adding that it was a defensive weapon and that Russia could use the money, about $900 million.
Although Ukraine was failing to fulfill the Minsk cease-fire agreements when it came to constitutional reform and financial support for the separatist regions, Russia would stick with the accord, he said. There are no Russian troops fighting in Ukraine now, he said, and there will be no war along Russia's southwestern border.
Mr. Putin took several pot shots at the United States, blaming it for the rise of the Islamic State, for example, through the destabilization of Iraq after the American-orchestrated overthrow of Saddam Hussein. And he accused Washington of pressuring world leaders into skipping Moscow's celebration of the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II in Europe.
Mr. Putin has two main public personas. There is the angry Putin who sometimes seems to sneer at the world and makes speeches like one exhorting security officers to stamp out internal threats. Then there is the "good," avuncular Putin who was on display Thursday, giving mostly moderate answers to all manner of questions.
In the fall, Mr. Putin suggested that to protect Russian speakers, Moscow would seize back territory in neighboring states -- notably areas in southeastern Ukraine first seized by Catherine the Great. On Thursday, he took virtually the opposite tack.
"We have no imperial ambitions," he said, "but we can ensure a decent life to the people, including Russians, living abroad, in the neighboring countries of the former Soviet Union, by developing collaboration and cooperation."
Mr. Putin said he saw no reason for the city of Moscow to keep removing all the flowers and flags citizens were placing on the bridge where the opposition politician Boris Y. Nemtsov was assassinated in February, and said he would have a word with Moscow's mayor about it.
While Mr. Putin was speaking, however, a different face of Russia was on display in the capital. At a security conference across town, senior members of the military said Russia wanted global cooperation on issues like combating terrorism, but would not stand idly by as NATO expanded eastward.
And security officers raided the Moscow headquarters of Open Russia, an organization funded by Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, the jailed oil oligarch turned political exile.
This year's studio audience was notable in that many of those called upon were often critical of Mr. Putin, and one television host, Kirill Kleymenov, asked tough questions.
But when topics seemed too closely linked to the president, he threw them right back at the questioner. At one point, Mr. Kleymenov suggested that Mr. Putin's main economic policy seemed to be waiting for the price of oil to recover, a question Mr. Putin called "overly critical."
Mr. Putin evoked the hated 1990s government economists who, in the view of many Russians, pursued a misguided policy of capitalist shock therapy that ushered in a decade of instability and poverty. Russians revile them, and Mr. Putin's popularity in his third term as president rests in no small part on the fact that until last fall, the economy was stable and wages increased steadily along with the price of oil for much of the past 15 years.
"In order to build up economic policy competently, of course, you need a brain," Mr. Putin said. "But if we want people to trust us, we also need a heart and need to feel how an ordinary man lives."

Abstract: The newness of the bond-buying program has not stopped some economists from urging the European Central Bank to start planning how to taper its purchases -- as the Federal Reserve is already doing in the United States.

Full text:   FRANKFURT -- Just weeks ago, the European Central Bank began a bond-buying program intended to stimulate the economy and to last at least 18 months. On Wednesday, the bank's president, Mario Draghi, indicated that the measure had already begun to bear fruit.
The eurozone as he described it is benefiting from a convergence of low oil prices, improved government policy and -- not least -- the bank's newest stimulus program.
A bond-buying program begun a month ago is "proceeding smoothly," Mr. Draghi said at a news conference, which happened to take place on one of the balmiest spring days of the year so far in Frankfurt.
Mr. Draghi's news conference did not proceed quite as smoothly. As he was briefing reporters, a young woman jumped from the news media seats, tossed papers and confetti at Mr. Draghi and shouted "end E.C.B. dictatorship" before she was subdued by security guards. It was a rare breach of bank security.
A woman named Josephine Witt who described herself as a freelance activist claimed responsibility for the confetti attack on Twitter. On her Twitter feed, Ms. Witt provided a link to a Wikipedia entry that says she is a 21-year-old philosophy student in Hamburg who took part in a topless protest against Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president, while he was on a visit to Hanover in 2013.
The central bank said in a statement later that the protester had masqueraded as a journalist, passed an identity check and had been through a metal detector. After a brief break, Mr. Draghi, though he appeared rattled, resumed reading the central bank's opening statement.
While acknowledging that extremely low interest rates could feed asset bubbles or pose other risks, Mr. Draghi said the central bank was sticking to its plan to keep buying government bonds and other debt at a rate of 60 billion euros, or about $63.6 billion, a month at least through September 2016.
He said there was no sign that, as some analysts have argued, the central bank could have trouble finding enough debt to buy that meets its standards.
Talk about "scarcity in the bond market is really premature," Mr. Draghi said. "We really don't see such a phenomenon."
The program, known as quantitative easing, is a form of money printing intended to push down interest rates and nudge inflation back toward the official target of close to 2 percent. While improvement in inflation will take some time, the effect on bonds has been more immediate, as the program has stoked demand. As Mr. Draghi pledged his commitment to the stimulus, the yield on Germany's 10-year bond dropped more than 20 percent to 0.105 in afternoon trading in Europe, potentially on the way to joining Switzerland in having negative long-term yields.
The newness of the bond-buying program has not stopped some economists from urging the European Central Bank to start planning how to taper its purchases -- as the Federal Reserve is already doing in the United States.
On Wednesday, economists at Allianz, a large German insurer, called on the central bank to establish benchmarks for scaling back its bond buying. As inflation picks up, the bank should cut its purchases to avoid negative side effects, the Allianz economists said.
"The program has substantial effects on financial markets," Michael Heise, the chief economist at Allianz, said in a meeting with several reporters on Wednesday. "The E.C.B. has to confront the question of whether it should have some flexibility built into the program."
Mr. Draghi batted away suggestions that the central bank should already be discussing how to back out of bond buying.
"We've been in this program only a month," Mr. Draghi said, invoking a simile on running. "It's like asking yourself after 1K, are you going to finish this marathon?"
He acknowledged that central bank intervention in debt markets, which have pushed the market interest rates on many government bonds into negative territory, comes with risks.
"We are aware that very low interest rates for a very long time are fertile terrain for financial stability imbalances," Mr. Draghi said. "Having said that, we don't see at this point in time evidence of systemically large financial imbalances."
The central bank could deal with any risks by using its power as a bank regulator, he said, not by changing monetary policy. Eurozone banks are in much better shape than they were three years ago, he added, so that borrowers are finally benefiting from the cheap cash the central bank makes available to commercial lenders.
"More accommodative monetary policy is being translated into better credit conditions," he said, "which is not something we have seen before."
Mr. Draghi noted that financial forecasters had followed the lead of the E.C.B. as it raised its economic growth expectation for 2015, predicting it will accelerate to 1.5 percent from an earlier forecast of 1 percent.
While government borrowing costs continued to drop, stocks on Wednesday were little changed, rising by 0.5 percent. The euro, which has fallen sharply against the dollar in recent months, was down slightly to about $1.06.
The central bank also left its main interest rate unchanged at a low of 0.05 percent. As a policy tool, it has been all but eclipsed by the so-called quantitative easing program that the central bank began in March.
Some economists are hesitant to give too much credit to the European Central Bank for recent growth. The economy has also benefited from low fuel prices and a steep fall in the value of the euro, which bolsters exports by making products from the eurozone less expensive for customers paying in dollars and other major currencies.
Cheap fuel and a weak euro will most likely be temporary, and economists have warned that the recovery could be short-lived unless eurozone countries do more to create permanent conditions for faster growth, for example by loosening rigid labor regulations.
"The risk is great that if these conditions turn around, there would be a big drop in growth," Mr. Heise of Allianz said. "The economy is not yet self-sustaining."
Mr. Draghi said that, while governments have made progress in improving business conditions, they should take advantage of favorable conditions now to do more, for example making it easier for companies to hire and fire.
"Our monetary policy finds its natural complement in structural reforms," he said.
Mr. Draghi did not appear overly concerned that Greece's financial condition is an imminent threat to the stability of the eurozone. The European Central Bank plays a crucial role because it controls the flow of emergency lending to Greek banks, without which some would probably collapse.
The E.C.B. has taken a hard line with the government of Greece but has avoided a bigger crisis by providing a drip feed of cash to Greek banks. European Central Bank lending to Greek banks has reached [euro]110 billion, Mr. Draghi said, more than any other eurozone country in terms of the proportion to the size of the economy.
Mr. Draghi said the central bank would continue to support Greek banks. But he emphasized that it was up to political leaders to resolve an impasse over the terms of European Union loans to the Athens government.
"It's entirely in the hands of the Greek government," he said, "and the negotiations that are taking place between the Greek government and the euro area members."

Full text:   Nationwide protests on Wednesday by tens of thousands of low-wage workers were planned long before Hillary Rodham Clinton announced her candidacy for president on Sunday. But the demonstrations -- part of the Fight for $15 campaign that began with fast-food workers in 2012 and now includes retail employees, child-care workers, home-care aides, airport workers and adjunct professors, among others -- have proved well timed.
Ms. Clinton has offered herself as a champion of "everyday Americans," saying that "the deck is still stacked in favor of those at the top." That view dovetails with the everyday reality of the protesters, who by and large work at big and profitable companies with highly-compensated executives, and yet do not make enough to live on.
The Republicans, declared and undeclared, have so far mostly skirted the issue, and seem largely to believe that income inequality is unrelated to concentrations of wealth at the top of the economic ladder.
No matter where the candidates stand now, however, the reality of grindingly low pay amid great corporate plenty means that all presidential aspirants should be obliged to spell out in detail where they stand on raising the minimum wage, currently $7.25 an hour, as well as their views on related labor issues.
Many Senate Democrats have signaled support for lifting the minimum wage to $12 an hour by 2020. But that is both low and slow. A credible raise must not only improve on today's inadequate minimum, but restore it to a level that accounts for inflation in wages and prices over recent decades, as well as the growth in labor productivity. Simply raising the hourly minimum in line with wage and price inflation would put it at about $11 today; adjusting it for productivity growth would put it at about $18.
Real leadership will also require going beyond calling for a robust minimum wage. It also means supporting the protesters' parallel demand for the right to organize without retaliation, which would lay the groundwork for collective bargaining in service industries.
President Obama's support for unions has been disappointing. He did not keep a 2008 campaign promise to push for legislation to make unionizing easier and has made scant use of his bully pulpit to register protest as unions have come under attack in many states.
And in his executive orders to improve working conditions for employees of federal contractors, he stopped short of requiring that such contractors support collective bargaining.
Defending workers can be politically troublesome, and restacking the deck, as the protesters are demanding, won't be easy. But it will be easy to tell if the candidates are really trying.

Abstract: After the Republican-controlled legislature in Michigan balked at raising the minimum wage early last year, activists collected 300,000 signatures on behalf of a proposed ballot initiative to raise the state's wage floor to $10.10 from $7.40, and index it to inflation thereafter.

Full text:   The grass-roots energy building around the minimum wage issue may upend Hillary Rodham Clinton's plans to ease into proposing specific economic policies.
The issue will be in the foreground on Wednesday, when fast-food and other low-wage workers plan a nationwide walkout that is expected to draw tens of thousands of people to rally support for a $15-an-hour minimum wage. The protest is the latest show of strength by the Fight for $15, a campaign that economists partly credit with the recent decisions by employers like Walmart and McDonald's to raise the minimum wage they pay workers.
The daylong strike may provide the first test for the campaign at managing the desire of voters and party activists for an aggressive approach to mitigating income inequality. Mrs. Clinton said that she was running for president because "the deck is still stacked in favor of those at the top," but she has offered few details about how to bridge that gap.
"The campaign is clearly going to have to come out with a position on it," said Dean Baker, a progressive economist who met with economic advisers to Mrs. Clinton on other issues. "There is pressure on her to come up with a number."
Unlike free trade or financial sector profits, the minimum wage issue is not one that in principle creates a political problem for Mrs. Clinton, who has long supported the policy. The challenge is the sheer speed at which the center of the debate has shifted, and the hunger among voters for action.
Already, moderate Democratic politicians around the country have begun to advocate substantial increases in the minimum wage, which is $7.25 an hour on the federal level although can be higher in states and localities.
Mayor Rahm Emanuel of Chicago, a former Clinton White House aide, recently backed a measure raising the minimum wage in the city to $13 from $8.25 by 2019. Senator Patty Murray of Washington is lining up support among a wide array of Democratic senators for a proposal that would raise the minimum wage to $12 an hour by 2020.
"The days of debating $9 or $10 an hour are over. The active debate is in the realm of $12 to $15," said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, a grass-roots organizing group with nearly one million members. "In 2016, the Murray $12-an-hour position will be the floor, not the ceiling."
It is not just grass-roots activists and Mrs. Clinton's fellow Democratic politicians who have come out in favor of a substantial wage increase. Those who attended the semiannual meeting this week of the Democracy Alliance, a network of wealthy progressive donors created with help from the billionaire investor George Soros and the insurance mogul Peter Lewis, reported that the minimum-wage campaign had become a topic of discussion as the donors grappled with income inequality.
"Fast-food workers in the street for $15, that changes the conversation," said Stephen M. Silberstein, a member of the Democracy Alliance, who also was executive producer of the recent documentary, Inequality for All. "You didn't have that a couple years ago."
With a recent accumulation of economic literature suggesting that moderate increases in the minimum wage have little to no cost when it comes to employment, opposition even among economists in the business world has begun to melt. Last Thursday, the economic research department of Goldman Sachs, which is widely followed by policy makers, released an analysis of minimum wage increases that made no allusion to possible job losses.
"It was remarkable to me," said Jared Bernstein, a former economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. who is now a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. "There was no mention in the whole analysis of disemployment effects."
Even Republicans, whose party has long been skeptical of the minimum wage, have begun to soften their opposition. "I'm not for repealing the minimum wage," Senator Marco Rubio of Florida said at a candidate forum in January. "But I can tell you, I don't want people to make $10.10 an hour. I want them to make $30 an hour."
After the Republican-controlled legislature in Michigan balked at raising the minimum wage early last year, activists collected 300,000 signatures on behalf of a proposed ballot initiative to raise the state's wage floor to $10.10 from $7.40, and index it to inflation thereafter. One day before activists planned to submit the petition, the Republican legislature passed an increase to $9.25, including the permanent cost-of-living adjustment.
"There was terror that it would get on the November ballot," said Saru Jayaraman, whose group Restaurant Opportunities Centers United fights for wage increases for tipped workers. "There's a lot of talk in Michigan of coming back and doing it again."
With the issue so volatile, Republicans are not the only one being overtaken by grass-roots developments. President Obama initially came out for a $9-an-hour minimum wage in his 2013 State of the Union address, then embraced $10.10 later that year. Though it was a significant increase for a White House to advocate, many Democrats by that point had already set their sights substantially higher with the Fight for $15 campaign gaining prominence.
"Progressives were pleased we rightly moved to $10.10," said Gene Sperling, who was Mr. Obama's top economic adviser between 2011 and early 2014 and has also advised Mrs. Clinton. "But with Republicans blocking it in Congress, advocates understandably decided that it couldn't compete with the type of impressive grass-roots passion they have been able to generate fighting for $15 city by city."
The White House has yet to take a position on Senator Murray's proposal for a $12 minimum wage.
Mrs. Clinton has voiced her support for the "fast-food and domestic workers all across our country who ask for nothing more than a living wage and a fair shot."
An aide said that, "she's for an increase in the minimum wage, and she wants to have a conversation about the right target and timeline."
Even progressive economists argue that some caution is merited. Mr. Bernstein, a supporter of a substantial minimum wage increase with a reputation as being the Obama White House's most liberal in-house economist, said that $15 an hour gave him pause because it was "out of sample." That is, there was no precedent to demonstrate it wouldn't cost jobs.
The question of speed, though, may be especially sensitive for Mrs. Clinton.
She may ultimately align with her party's base on many economic issues. But any reluctance by Mrs. Clinton to say whether she explicitly supports the goals of the Fight for $15 campaign -- or even how far toward them she would hope to come as president -- could curb enthusiasm for her candidacy among progressives and low-income workers at the very moment she's officially engaged.
Mrs. Clinton, after all, promised in her announcement that she wanted to be a champion for "everyday Americans." She pledged to labor on their behalf "so that you can do more than just get by. You can get ahead, and stay ahead."
"She has a massive challenge in the general election," said Zephyr Teachout, the Fordham Law School professor who mounted an unexpectedly strong Democratic primary challenge to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York last year. "The strategy of silence and then gradual coming around does not lead people, even if the sentence polls well, to get out and organize."

Abstract: Mr. Connelly found that in rolling 12-month periods for the five years through 2013, balanced fund investors had the lowest redemption rates among five broad types of funds, which also included domestic stock, foreign stock, municipal and taxable bond funds. The $4.2 billion T. Rowe Price Balanced fund recently had more than 20 percent of assets invested abroad. [...]owning bonds and stocks in separate funds or E.T.F.s (or individual issues for that matter) makes it easier to harvest tax losses, said Gary Schatsky, a financial adviser in Manhattan.

Full text:   In a world teeming with new varieties of mutual funds and exchange traded funds, the old-school balanced fund might seem like a Model T in a Tesla world.
But classic balanced funds, which typically hold 60 percent or so in large-capitalization United States stocks and 40 percent in high-grade domestic bonds, don't seem to be suffering from obsolescence.
The five-year average annualized return for moderate allocation funds -- Morningstar's nomenclature for funds that take a balanced approach of owning stocks and bonds -- is a none-too-shabby 8.9 percent.
The granddaddy of balanced funds, the $90 billion Vanguard Wellington mutual fund, delivered a near 11 percent annualized gain over that stretch. Now in its ninth decade of operation, Vanguard Wellington offers a rare real-world, long-term track record through numerous bull and bear markets for both stocks and bonds, not some hypothetical back-tested result. A $10,000 investment at the fund's start in 1929 has grown at an annualized pace of 8.3 percent and is now worth nearly $9 million.
If the $10,000 had merely grown at the rate of inflation, it would be worth about $138,000 today. Wellington's vanilla performance has been impressive.
"Complexity does not necessarily outperform," said Fran Kinniry, a principal in Vanguard's investment strategy group.
Research from Mr. Kinniry's group shows that in the five years through 2013 the average annualized gain of hundreds of United States university and college investment endowment portfolios trailed a 60/40 balanced approach by about two percentage points, and over 10 years the 7.4 percent annualized gain for the balanced approach outpaced the gains of 90 percent of endowments. The model used by Vanguard divided the stock portion among domestic stocks (42 percentage points) and international equities (18 percent points).
At the heart of their strategy, balanced funds give a slight overweight to stocks for their growth potential, which they couple with the ballast of bonds. That makes them a "classic hedge that will keep you out of a lot of trouble," said John S. Osterweis, founder and chief investment officer of Osterweis Capital Management.
That's not faint praise. The ability to avoid bone-crushing losses in down markets is at least as important to long-term success as solid gains in rising ones. And that's a central function of a balanced approach.
MFS Investment recently examined the performance of a 60/40 portfolio during rolling 12-month periods from January 1976 through December 2013. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index represented the stocks in the portfolio and the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index stood in for bonds. There was just one 12-month stretch in which the balanced portfolio lost more than 25 percent and 16 periods when rolling 12-month losses were at least 10 percent.
If you instead owned only stocks, you would have had to stomach 10 periods of losses of at least 25 percent and 46 stretches when the loss was at least 10 percent. For the 37-year period, the 60/40 approach delivered about 90 percent of the return of an all-equity portfolio with one-third less volatility.
David W. Connelly, director of global product at MFS and author of the study, notes that the less bumpy ride of a balanced portfolio can help loss-phobic investors stay the course. The automatic rebalancing of the portfolio also helps.
"You're not letting your winners run too long, and you're buying lower when markets are down," Mr. Connelly said. The upshot can be some virtuous inertia, as balanced fund investors seem less inclined to chase performance. Mr. Connelly found that in rolling 12-month periods for the five years through 2013, balanced fund investors had the lowest redemption rates among five broad types of funds, which also included domestic stock, foreign stock, municipal and taxable bond funds.
WHILE balanced funds are certainly a viable option, there are trade-offs. Depending on your age, investment goal and appetite for risk, a static stock target of 60 percent may not be your personal Goldilocks portfolio.
You're also likely to have a somewhat xenophobic portfolio, as classic balanced funds tend to traffic mostly in domestic stocks. The Vanguard Balanced Index fund is 100 percent domestic. Vanguard Wellington has 8 percent of its assets invested in foreign stocks. The $82 billion American Balanced fund and the $12 billion Dodge & Cox Balanced fund currently have 7 percent invested abroad. One outlier: The $4.2 billion T. Rowe Price Balanced fund recently had more than 20 percent of assets invested abroad.
Moreover, owning bonds and stocks in separate funds or E.T.F.s (or individual issues for that matter) makes it easier to harvest tax losses, said Gary Schatsky, a financial adviser in Manhattan. It's also easier to calibrate the risk of shifting interest rates. "I can choose a short-term bond fund for a client, but with a balanced fund, chances are I am going to get a bond portfolio with a longer duration," he said. The longer a fund's duration, the bigger its price declines when interest rates rise. The current average duration for moderate allocation funds in Morningstar's database is near five years.
The bond side of the balanced fund may be a headwind for returns over the next decade. That's because the current yield for high-grade bonds foretells future returns. With the 10-year Treasury note currently yielding about 2 percent, it is mathematically impossible for high-grade bonds to deliver the same returns as in decades past, when yields were at least twice as high.
But that doesn't change bonds' classic airbag role during market crashes. In the 2007-8 bear market that sent the S.&P. 500 down more than 55 percent, the average balanced fund lost just 40 percent, because high-grade bonds rose in value during the stock drop. Those were big losses but not nearly as big as in most pure stock funds.
"To argue that balanced funds can't work is to argue that diversification doesn't work," said Ben Carlson, an institutional money manager, who writes extensively on the value of diversification at his blog, A Wealth of Common Sense.
Still, some strategists say it's wise to lower expectations. Based on current market valuations, Research Affiliates, a money manager in Newport Beach, Calif., forecasts a 1 percent inflation-adjusted return over the next 10 years for a domestic 60/40 portfolio.
The economics team at Vanguard isn't as dour, noting that a global balanced fund could generate inflation-adjusted returns in the range of 3 percent to 5 percent over the next decade. (Vanguard assumes that of the stock portion, 18 percentage points are in foreign stocks, and of the bond portion eight percentage points are in foreign bonds.) That's just for the next decade. As Wellington's long track record attests, for those who avoided moving their investment through feast and famine, keeping it simple has had a payoff.
"Old-fashioned tends to be seen as a bad thing, but a balanced approach is a classic solution that continues to work," Mr. Osterweis said.

Abstract: The pace of home sales reported by the National Association of Realtors for January and February was lower than for any month since last April, as was the average price of previously owned single-family homes. GDPNow, a running estimate of economic growth posted on the website of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, showed no change in gross domestic product in the first quarter.

Full text:   Stocks and bonds ended the first three months of 2015 little changed, leveling off from the steep rise of recent years and raising questions about the road ahead. The stall coincided with signs of flagging momentum in economic growth and corporate earnings and an assortment of foreign developments that threatened to derail the markets.
One asset rose substantially, reaching a 12-year high. That was the dollar, which rose 9 percent against a standard basket of currencies of American trading partners. Its ascent was partly driven by a standoff between financially feeble Greece and its European creditors that could force Greece out of the euro. The dollar was also propelled by an event that for years has seemed a few months away: an increase in the federal funds rate, the Federal Reserve's main short-term interest rate.
As expected, the Fed last month dropped its pledge to be patient about raising the rate, wording it had used consistently in its policy statements. But the rest of the March statement made clear that the central bank was in no hurry to raise the near-zero percent rate until the economy perks up.
The apparent belief among investors that the Fed was still on their side and that economic indicators were not working against them was enough to send the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index up, but barely: It rose less than 0.5 percent in the first quarter, to 2,067.89. Bond prices rose too, reducing the yield on the 10-year Treasury to 1.93 percent from 2.17 percent. Yields on high- and low-quality corporate instruments also fell, although less so.
Tacit assurances that no rate increase was imminent have long supported stocks and bonds, but concern is growing that the Fed may have painted itself into a corner. A rate increase could provoke turbulence in the markets, investment advisers warn, but continuing to delay could raise concern about the fragility of the markets, the economic recovery or both. Investors who have cheered the Fed's dovishness could be the ones whose patience is tested.
"The market believes the Fed doesn't have the capacity to raise rates, and that's not a healthy thing," said Jonathan Golub, chief United States market strategist at RBC Capital Markets. "They don't want to be at zero, but they don't want to remove accommodation in a way that's disruptive."
But given the Fed's desire to normalize policy, investors would be better off pondering "what the Fed's pace will be and how far they go," rather than obsessing over when rates will start rising, Mr. Golub said. He predicted that "whatever they do, they're going to do it really, really slowly," bringing Fed funds to about 1.75 percent by the end of 2017.
How successful the Fed has been in dragging the economy out of recession and financial turmoil is debatable. Joblessness has continued to trend lower, at least until a report released early this month showed much fewer net jobs created in March than expected, but wage growth has been sluggish and indicators of the housing market and consumer spending have been weak.
Each of the last three Census Bureau monthly reports on retail sales has shown a decline. The pace of home sales reported by the National Association of Realtors for January and February was lower than for any month since last April, as was the average price of previously owned single-family homes.
GDPNow, a running estimate of economic growth posted on the website of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, showed no change in gross domestic product in the first quarter.
Corporate profits have hit a rough patch, too. Earnings for the companies in the S.&P. 500 are estimated by FactSet Research Systems to be 4.7 percent lower in the first quarter than the period last year. For all of 2015, FactSet forecasts a 2.3 percent increase, less than half the 4.9 percent gain last year.
Fund returns in the first quarter were mediocre, in line with economic and corporate performance. The average domestic stock fund in Morningstar's database rose 2.6 percent, led by portfolios that focus on health care and consumer discretionary items, the sector that includes retailers, carmakers and travel companies. Funds that hold energy stocks were conspicuously weak, losing 2 percent, as the prices of oil and natural gas continued the plunges that began last June.
Energy companies account for much of the decline in earnings estimates. Leaving that sector out, Tobias Levkovich, chief United States equity strategist at Citi Research, found economic and corporate conditions satisfactory. Credit is still expanding, he said, manufacturing capacity is tight, and capital spending, excluding energy industries, is expected to rise 5 percent this year.
WHETHER the economy is doing well, poorly or so-so, there is a consensus that the United States is faring better than most of the rest of the world. Even so, foreign stock markets and funds that invest in them outperformed. The average international stock fund returned 3.4 percent, with funds that focus on Japan doing exceptionally well, up 12 percent. European funds rose 4.9 percent, while Latin American funds dropped 8.9 percent.
Funds that focus on India were notably strong performers, rising 8.4 percent. With many emerging markets facing difficulties, including high debt, weak currencies and slow global growth, India is "one shiny standout," said Elizabeth R. Morrissey, managing partner of Kleiman International Consultants. She credits success there, which she predicts will continue, to a package of business-friendly changes made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
At the other end of the spectrum is Brazil. Ms. Morrissey described its fortunes as "way scarier than others" because of the strong dollar, collapsing commodity prices, high inflation and a corruption scandal at Petrobras, the national oil company.
"The government has been in office three months, and people are already taking to the streets," she said.
The rising dollar has had a more benign effect elsewhere. Investment advisers attribute much of the strength in foreign stocks and the dollar to a single catalyst: diverging monetary policies. The Fed may be taking its time to turn hawkish, but few foreign central banks are even contemplating it and several are going in the opposite direction.
The European Central Bank started a program of bond purchases in the first quarter, the Bank of Japan continues to buy bonds, and the People's Bank of China is expected to do the same soon.
These moves have helped make many foreign stocks more appealing. The most recent edition of Bank of America Merrill Lynch's survey of global fund managers, released in mid-March, found managers with the greatest underweight position in American stocks, versus the rest of the world, since early 2008.
A Fed that is more hawkish than other central banks bolsters the dollar by keeping yields comparatively high on American bonds, enticing foreigners to buy them and, therefore, the dollar. But yields just about everywhere are historically low, perhaps perilously so, and prices are very high, said Joel Beam, manager of the Forward Select Opportunity fund.
"I'm extremely carefully positioned and selling into strength anything that seems overpriced," he said.
Bond investors escaped the first quarter mostly unscathed. The average fund was up 1.3 percent, with portfolios that specialize in long-term issues rising 3.2 percent. Two categories of funds that hold foreign bonds -- world bond and emerging-market bond -- were barely changed.
Mr. Beam prefers stocks, with reservations. "The stock landscape is pretty expensive, but people have to be thinking about having more equities in their life for the next five years," he said. "Rather than buy fixed income and get slaughtered, buy a good bank."
As for where to seek such a bank or other stock, he suggests Europe, which he considers to be in the early stages of a "robust healing process."
If Europe is on the mend, investment advisers credit the European Central Bank. Ms. Morrissey believes that the bond purchase program, or quantitative easing, has immunized other weak eurozone economies from danger should Greece leave the currency bloc.
"Mr. Draghi saved the day," she said, referring to Mario Draghi, the head of the bank. "I would expect" the prospect of a Greek exit "to have an impact on Italy, but with Q.E. it hasn't. The rest of the union will probably hold together."
As for Greece itself, Ms. Morrissey rates the odds slightly better than even that it will remain in the euro. It is uncertain whether "they have the cash to survive," she acknowledged, "but it seems the new Greek government really understands the severity of their situation."
Effusive praise for European policy makers is one reason Mr. Levkovich, the Citi Research equity strategist, prefers American stocks.
"Everyone loves Europe," he said. "That tells me they've bought it already."
Judging by the tripling of the S.&P. 500 in six years, a lot of investors have bought American stocks, too. He predicted further gains, but only about 7 percent this year. He recommended niches like retailing, financial services and parts of technology like infrastructure and security, and he said he would avoid health care and the bond market.
Mr. Golub, of RBC Capital Markets, also favored American stocks, and was cautious in his optimism. "The weight of evidence suggests the next six to 12 months look pretty safe," he said.
He warned that it was hard to know how to invest when investors and the Fed itself would prefer a reversion to normal monetary policy but are afraid of the first rate increase that would signal its arrival.
"We're in a bizarro land," Mr. Golub said. "The way investors are thinking is abnormal, but it's logical."

Full text:   United States import prices fell in March as rising petroleum costs were offset by declining prices for other goods, a sign of muted inflation that supports the view the Federal Reserve will probably not raise interest rates in June. The Labor Department said on Friday that import prices dropped 0.3 percent last month after a downwardly revised 0.2 percent gain in February. In the 12 months through March, prices plunged 10.5 percent, the largest drop since September 2009.

Full text:   Battered by a scandal over delays in approving groups for tax-exempt status and plagued by a backlog tens of thousands of cases long, the Internal Revenue Service unveiled a strikingly stripped-down online application last year to speed the process.
But to critics, the I.R.S.'s version of "don't ask, don't tell" is fraught with problems. An unlikely coalition of tax lawyers, state enforcement agents and even many nonprofits that favor simpler rules say that the agency -- by not asking any questions about governance, conflicts of interest or function, and saying applicants don't have to reveal any such issues -- is making it too easy to commit fraud.
The form, 1023-EZ, was introduced over the summer and is available to small charities with an annual income of $50,000 or less and assets under $250,000. Instead of wrestling with a painstaking 26-page application that demands extensive documentation, these groups can now fill out a two-and-a-half page checklist that requires no additional paperwork or even a statement of purpose.
"In many communities, it takes more to get a library card than it takes to get this new exempt status," said Tim Delaney, president and chief executive of the National Council of Nonprofits, a network of charitable groups. His group opposed the new form, arguing that the I.R.S. is abdicating its responsibility to screen groups, and that, in the long run, potential abuse will undermine public trust in charities.
The National Association of State Charity Officials has also taken a stand against the EZ route, complaining that it will further strain already overburdened regulators.
Tamera Ripperda, director of the I.R.S.'s Exempt Organizations division, said the criticisms were misplaced. "We underwent a thorough risk assessment of this form," Ms. Ripperda said.
Looking through its records, the I.R.S. found that about two-thirds of applicants were small, fledgling groups that had not started operating, so that the detailed vetting was premature. Once approved, groups are required to file yearly tax returns.
"We think that this is a better use of our resources," Ms. Ripperda said. "Rather than examining groups upfront on what they plan to do, we're going to examine them on what they're actually doing."
Since the EZ form's introduction last July, 28,000 groups have used it, Ms. Ripperda said. To check for abuse, the agency selected about 1,000 for more in-depth review and questioning.
"So far we've not found any indications that the EZ has been intentionally misused," she said. Processing time for the new EZ application is averaging 16 days, compared with an average of 110 days for the long form.
She added that the backlog of existing applications had also been eliminated.
Advocates and tax professionals have long complained that applying for exempt status was a punishing ordeal, particularly for charities with small budgets. The original Form 1023 requires a narrative statement and extensive documentation, including bylaws, articles of incorporation, copies of contracts with officers, directors and service providers, and financial data.
Nina Olson, the National Taxpayer Advocate, had urged the agency to adopt an EZ version, but the new form, she wrote in a memorandum to the agency last year, "goes too far in the opposite direction, effectively making a mockery of the I.R.S.'s significant oversight function."
She and other critics warn that without any review, even the best-meaning organizations could end up making serious legal and operational missteps.
As for those without the best intentions, some tax experts worry that the new application invites abuse.
"There is no real reporting to the I.R.S. on the front end or on an annual basis," said Marcus Owens, a Washington lawyer who was formerly the director of the I.R.S.'s Exempt Organizations division. "It puts an extraordinary amount of faith in taxpayers playing by the rules. Most will, but how many do you need creating scams before it becomes a problem? History shows people will take advantage of it."
With Tax Day little more than a week away, the Internal Revenue Service is struggling on several fronts to manage the onslaught of tax returns even as two Republican presidential candidates are campaigning to abolish the agency and Congress has imposed what many outside experts see as crippling budget cuts.
As for the I.R.S. itself, the commissioner, John A. Koskinen, has already sent up warning flares, telling the public to expect fewer audits, delayed refund checks and fewer protections against identity theft.
According to Mr. Koskinen, funding levels are down to what they were in 1998, after taking inflation into account. Yet the number of tax filers has increased by 30 million, and there are many new legislative demands, including responsibility for administering the tax credits that subsidize millions of people under the Affordable Care Act.
The backlog of tax-exempt applications, for example, began to build in 2010, Ms. Ripperda said, after Congress mandated the automatic revocation of status for groups that failed to file returns three years in a row.
Services intended to help taxpayers are also hurting. At a congressional hearing last month, Ms. Olson, the taxpayer advocate, testified that during the first seven weeks of this year, the I.R.S. was able to answer only 40 percent of taxpayer calls with an average hold time of about 26 minutes. Last year, during the same period, 76 percent of calls were answered with an average 11 minutes on hold.
A new report from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities chastises lawmakers for failing to provide "the I.R.S. with the funding it needs to administer the nation's tax laws and collect taxes."
Congress also continues to investigate roadblocks the agency used to stop certain groups from applying for tax-exempt status, including those associated with the Tea Party movement. The I.R.S. had engaged in its own form of profiling, using a "lookout list" of certain terms that flagged conservative and progressive groups as well as open-source software developers and Palestinian rights advocates. Much of the agency's top leadership resigned.
Still, several Republicans, including possible presidential contenders like Senator Ted Cruz and Senator Rand Paul, have gone so far as to propose abolishing the I.R.S. altogether.
"In my view, there is a powerful populist instinct to take the 110,000 employees at the I.R.S., to padlock the building and to put all 110,000 of them down on our Southern border," Mr. Cruz said in January, after the Republicans took control of Congress.
That's certainly not happening before April 15, if ever. So until further notice, the I.R.S. will still be on the case.

Full text:   MEDELLÍN, Colombia -- A top adviser to Secretary of State John Kerry was in Venezuela on Wednesday for a surprise meeting as the United States appeared to be seeking to lower the volume in the rancorous relationship between the countries ahead of a regional meeting of heads of state.
The Venezuelan government invited the United States to send a senior official to Caracas, the Venezuelan capital, to meet with President Nicolás Maduro before the Summit of the Americas meeting, according to a statement issued Wednesday by the State Department. That meeting of heads of state, including President Obama and President Maduro, will take place in Panama, starting Friday.
It was not clear whether the official, Thomas A. Shannon Jr., whose title is State Department counselor, met with Mr. Maduro. The statement said that he arrived on Tuesday and was scheduled to leave on Thursday.
The Venezuelan Foreign Ministry issued a statement saying that Mr. Shannon met with the Foreign Minister Delcy Rodríguez on Wednesday.
The United States is Venezuela's largest trading partner, and Venezuela is one of the largest foreign oil suppliers to the United states.
But Mr. Maduro, a leftist, regularly denounces Washington and accuses it of trying to overthrow his government. Officials in Washington have denied the charge.
Mr. Maduro faces a growing economic crisis, with one of the highest inflation rates in the world and shortages of many basic goods.
At the same time, he has stepped up a crackdown on the political opposition, throwing some opposition leaders in jail. On Tuesday the national prosecutor's office announced that it had formally filed conspiracy charges against one of the jailed leaders, Mayor Antonio Ledezma of Caracas, who Mr. Maduro claims was plotting to stage a coup.
The United States has been one of Mr. Maduro's harshest critics internationally, and last month, Mr. Obama signed an executive order levying sanctions against seven Venezuelan officials who the Obama administration said were responsible for human rights abuses or violations of due process.
The order also called Venezuela a threat to the national security of the United States.
Mr. Maduro responded with a propaganda campaign, accusing Washington of planning an invasion of Venezuela as he sought to drum up support at home and abroad in the face of what he said was American imperialist aggression.
His government says that it has collected millions of signatures from Venezuelans on a petition calling for Mr. Obama to rescind the executive order. Officials have said that Venezuela planned to give the signed petitions to Mr. Obama at this week's summit meeting.
The statement Wednesday from the Foreign Ministry said that Mr. Shannon "brought a message from his government" and that Ms. Rodriguez reiterated the demand that the executive order be rescinded.
A day before Mr. Shannon's visit was announced, a White House official backed off the language in the executive order that declared Venezuela to be a national security threat.
"The United States does not believe that Venezuela poses some threat to our national security," said Benjamin J. Rhodes, deputy national security adviser for strategic communications, during a telephone call with reporters to discuss the president's trip.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Abstract: The Fed has held short-term interest rates near zero since December 2008 as part of its campaign to stimulate economic growth, which has included the accumulation of more than $4 trillion in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve is looking increasingly unlikely to start raising its benchmark interest rate in June.
A number of Fed officials expressed doubts about beginning in June during the March meeting of the Fed's policy-making committee; according to an account the central bank published on Wednesday. And those doubts have since been reinforced by a disappointing estimate of March job growth, and by the continued sluggishness of inflation.
"Data has very much surprised to the downside," William C. Dudley, the influential president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, told Reuters on Wednesday. "It'd be reasonable to think that the timing of the Fed's first rate hike might be a little further off in time."
The Fed has held short-term interest rates near zero since December 2008 as part of its campaign to stimulate economic growth, which has included the accumulation of more than $4 trillion in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities.
That campaign is drawing to a close. The Fed said after the March policy meeting that economic conditions were strong enough that it would consider raising rates as early as the committee's June meeting.
But according to the minutes of the March meeting, released after a standard three-week delay, only a minority of Fed officials said that it was likely that the economy would be strong enough for the Fed to start raising rates that soon.
"Several participants judged that the economic data and outlook were likely to warrant beginning normalization at the June meeting," the minutes said. "However, others anticipated that the effects of energy price declines and the dollar's appreciation would continue to weigh on inflation in the near term, suggesting that conditions likely would not be appropriate to begin raising rates until later in the year."
This debate among Fed officials about the proper calibration of its stimulus campaign is playing out in a narrow range. Most officials agree the Fed should start raising rates this year because the health of the labor market has improved considerably. Most also agree that the economic impact of starting to raise rates in June is likely to be roughly the same as starting in July or September.
Jeffrey M. Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., said last month there was a "strong case" for raising rates at the Fed's June meeting. He said he expected the recent run of lackluster economic data to be transitory.
Dennis P. Lockhart, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, also said he expected growth to rebound, but he was among a majority of Fed officials, led by the chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, that saw no harm in waiting to be certain.
"I would probably be biased toward the July or September dates as opposed to June," Mr. Lockhart, a bellwether moderate, told Bloomberg on Monday. "We will have more data, and we will give the economy a little more time to prove out the thesis that I laid out, that the first quarter was anomalous again, just like a year ago."
Only a few Fed officials stand outside this consensus, arguing that the Fed should not increase rates until wages and prices start to rise more quickly. Narayana Kocherlakota, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, said on Tuesday that the Fed should be "extraordinarily patient" in choosing its moment because many people are still struggling to find work while inflation remains well below the 2 percent annual pace that the Fed regards as best for the economy.
"I continue to believe that it would be a mistake to raise the target range for the fed funds rate in 2015," Mr. Kocherlakota told an audience in Bismarck, N.D., on Tuesday.
This view is more popular outside the Fed, according to a recent survey of economists by the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. The largest number said the Fed should wait to raise rates until price increases are stronger.
But Ms. Yellen and other officials say they do not plan to wait. Changes in monetary policy influence economic conditions only gradually, and so they contend the Fed must take account of the water already in the hose in deciding when to shut the spigot.
Even those who favor waiting a little longer do not necessarily rule out a June rate increase. Mr. Dudley, in his comments on Wednesday, noted that economic growth this year had fallen short of the Fed's predictions and that "the bar is probably a little bit higher" for a June increase. But he said it remained a possibility.
"I could imagine circumstances where a June rate hike is still in play," he said, if the jobs report on April, to be released in early May, is very strong, or if growth "looks like it is bouncing quite sharply."

Full text:   LONDON -- Energy companies have spent months in a state of strategic paralysis, wary of making big moves with oil prices plunging.
Now, the mind-set is shifting, as the industry giants look to capitalize on the weakness.
On Wednesday, Royal Dutch Shell agreed to buy the BG Group for $70 billion. It is the first major deal for an oil and gas producer since prices started falling last summer.
The acquisition could provide a template in the current environment, with deep-pocketed players taking advantage of their competitors' problems to bolster their own position.
In buying BG, Shell is concentrating on the fast-growing business of producing and selling liquefied natural gas. It will also become a major player in Brazil's offshore oil fields, where Shell's exposure has been small.
Shell is taking advantage of the financial struggles of BG. Before the deal was announced, BG had watched its shares fall more than 30 percent since May.
Liquefied natural gas "is a very very important component of this," Ben van Beurden, Shell's chief executive, told reporters on Wednesday. "It is really the strength of both companies."
Deal makers have predicted that the plunge in oil prices could spark interest among would-be acquirers eager for bargains. Other potential buyers, like private equity firms, have amassed billions of dollars to hunt for new trophies.
Many of these bankers and lawyers, though, have cautioned that would-be sellers may find other ways to raise money, rather that risk auctions at fire-sale prices. For example, Whiting Petroleum, a midsize oil and gas company, chose to raise $2 billion in debt and sell 35 million shares after failing to draw an attractive takeover offer.
But the attractions of energy mergers -- including the benefits of greater scale and the ability to move into productive fields of oil and gas -- may ultimately compel many players to the negotiating table.
Shell, in large part, is betting on a changing international energy market.
As global energy needs have soared, companies are looking to liquefied natural gas, or L.N.G., to meet the demands. The process involves supercooling natural gas into a liquid that can be transported around the world on ships. By doing so, natural gas has become a global commodity, with companies bringing supplies from remote locations in Africa to energy-hungry markets like China and India.
L.N.G. is often used to meet peak energy demand in Persian Gulf countries like Dubai and Kuwait to power air-conditioning in the summer. Britain uses it to meet peak demand during the winter heating season.
L.N.G. also has the potential to reduce the leverage that pipeline gas suppliers have over their customers. Lithuania, for instance, has built an L.N.G. facility to ease its dependence on Russian gas. Poland is working on a similar plant.
With the technology taking hold, global L.N.G. surged rapidly in the early 1990s. But demand leveled off in recent years, tempered by weak economic growth, high prices and a lack of new supplies. Many forecasters expect the business to bounce back, growing in the high single-digits over the next decade.
"The long-term expectation is for a resumption of rapid growth because of fundamentals and in response to current low prices," said Christopher Goncalves, head of the energy practice at the Berkeley Research Group, a consulting firm based in Washington.
More than any of its rivals, Shell has staked its future on natural gas, L.N.G. in particular. Over the last decade, Shell has invested $56 billion in the cooling plants, terminals and other facilities required to produce L.N.G. and other gas-derived fuels.
When Repsol ran into trouble in Argentina, Shell swooped in to purchase the company's well-regarded L.N.G. business for $5.4 billion. Shell is also developing a large floating L.N.G. installation, called Prelude, to process the output of a gas field off Australia.
With the purchase of BG, Shell is building on that base, adding to existing projects in places like Trinidad and Australia. The deal will enhance the portfolio as well, with BG's gas discoveries off Tanzania in East Africa, a future growth area where Shell has been unable to establish a foothold.
Both companies are positioned to benefit from the shale gas boom in the United States. BG has a contract to buy L.N.G. from a facility called Sabine Pass on the Gulf of Mexico, owned by Cheniere Energy. Shell has an interest in a facility planned for an island off Georgia.
The greater scale and additional sources of supply should provide an advantage for Shell. The company, already considered a sophisticated L.N.G. trader, would be able to further define its shipping routes and send cargoes to destinations offering the highest price, wherever they are.
So far, the big push into L.N.G. has proved a blessing for Shell, particularly at a tough time for its oil business as well as its refining units. Last year, the company reported $11.3 billion in earnings from L.N.G. and related businesses, about 75 percent of its overall income. By adding BG, Shell expects to increase its L.N.G. capacity by 73 percent in the next three years.
BG, by comparison, has been going through a rocky period since the sudden departure of its chief executive, Chris Finlayson, last year. The company has been particularly hurt in recent months by its operations in Egypt.
To satisfy growing demand stoked by cheap subsidized energy prices, the country's government, also facing social unrest, diverted the company's production for domestic purposes. As a result, BG couldn't get sufficient gas supplies to meet its L.N.G. export commitments.
Since the departure of Mr. Finlayson, Andrew Gould, BG's chairman, has largely been steering the company. Helge Lund, a former chief executive of Norway's Statoil, took the helm of BG about two months ago.
Mr. Gould, a former chief executive of the energy technology company Schlumberger, took the lead, negotiating the deal directly with Shell's chief, Mr. van Beurden.
Mr. van Beurden said at a news conference on Wednesday that after Shell decided to move ahead with the deal, he called Mr. Gould and the two met on March 15 in London, where "we had a very good discussion."
Mr. Gould told reporters that he and Mr. Lund had looked forward to turning around BG. But when the board and Mr. Lund looked at the Shell offer, they found it too compelling to pass up.
Investors, though, have viewed the deal skeptically, at least initially. Shell's stock price was off more than 5 percent on Wednesday. The main knock is the 50 percent premium that Shell is paying over BG's Tuesday closing price, although the stock is well off its high.
A more fundamental concern may be that L.N.G. prices are under pressure from a variety of factors, including oversupply in the market and weaker-than-expected growth in demand from countries like China. Asian spot prices, for instance, have fallen by nearly 50 percent from their 2014 highs.
Most L.N.G. is sold under long-term contracts, whose terms are usually not disclosed. But because they are linked to oil, usually with a several-month time lag, they are also coming down.
That will put pressure on Shell's profits, particularly on L.N.G. from the high-cost Australian projects to which both Shell and BG have substantial exposure.
"We believe that Shell will have to work very hard to convince shareholders that the strategic benefits outweigh the premium offered," Iain Reid, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets, a Canadian bank, wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday.

Full text:   A BANK IS BORN
After a series of financial crises challenged the historical aversion to a national bank, the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 established a system of 12 privately owned reserve banks in major cities, preserving the power of financial elites. But the banks would be overseen by a board of presidential appointees, granting the public a new measure of control over the financial system.
DEPRESSION LESSONS
Disagreements between the reserve banks and the central board paralyzed the Fed, allowing the money supply to shrink by a third and fueling the Depression. Congress reacted by strengthening the central board and empowering the president to devalue the dollar -- a step away from the gold standard and toward a Fed-managed currency.
WARTIME ALLY
In World War II, the Fed agreed to hold down rates at the Treasury's request to enable cheaper government borrowing. In the Vietnam era, it acceded to pressure from President Lyndon B. Johnson to print money, facilitating the war effort and ambitious social programs.
NEW ORDERS
A recession in the mid-1970s pushed unemployment to 9 percent, prompting the Democratic Congress to enact legislation instructing the Fed to pursue maximum employment as well as price stability -- a "dual mandate." It was a high-water mark for congressional interference.
TAMING INFLATION
Faced with double-digit inflation, a new Fed chief, Paul A. Volcker, right, moved in the late 1970s and early '80s to raise rates sharply, causing a deep recession. Though there was political heat, the Fed's independence was acknowledged, and inflation was brought under control.
MORE OPENNESS
Responding to critics who said independence required transparency, the Fed gradually shed many layers of its secretive culture, releasing more economic reports, announcing its actions after each policy meeting, and under Ben S. Bernanke, initiating quarterly news conferences.
POLITICAL CRITICISM
After the financial crisis of 2008, Congress moved to strengthen the Fed's regulatory responsibilities. But congressional Republicans criticized its stimulus campaign to revive the economy as an excessive and inflationary intervention, and they put forward proposals to constrain the central bank.

Abstract: The Fed is charged by Congress with minimizing inflation and maximizing employment, a mandate formalized in 1978 by the Humphrey-Hawkins Act. Since the Great Recession, inflation has been unusually slow while jobs have been unusually scarce. Some Republicans are in favor of directing the Fed to focus solely on price stability, in line with the operating instructions for most central banks in developed nations, including the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- At a hearing in February, Representative Scott Garrett, a New Jersey Republican, complained that Congress and the Federal Reserve had traded places.
During previous periods of high unemployment, members of Congress pressed the Fed to print more money even as the Fed remained wary of the inflationary consequences of such efforts.
After the Great Recession, by contrast, the loudest criticism has come from politicians demanding that the Fed shut down its printing press and raise interest rates.
Republicans like Mr. Garrett argue the central bank needs to be reined in because they say it has abandoned caution in its continuing effort to stimulate faster economic growth. They say the Fed was granted considerable autonomy so it could keep inflation under control, and it is now abusing that independence.
"The people pushing back on your decisions are those arguing for a tougher monetary policy, not a looser one," Mr. Garrett told Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, during the hearing in late February. "This flies in the face of the original stated rationale for political independence in monetary policy."
The Fed has long been a popular target for politicians during periods of economic distress. Sarah Binder, a political scientist at George Washington University, has shown that congressional prodding of the Fed rises and falls with the unemployment rate.
But she also found a striking shift: Democrats once proposed most bills to change the Federal Reserve but in recent years Republicans have taken their place, offering about two-thirds of such measures since 2010.
The Fed's chairman for most of that period, Ben S. Bernanke, was a Republican initially appointed by a Republican president. Under his leadership, the Fed reduced interest rates nearly to zero and embarked on several rounds of highly unusual "quantitative easing," amassing more than $4 trillion in Treasury and mortgage-backed securities in a bid to further reduce borrowing costs for business and consumers.
Easy-money policies like those pursued by Mr. Bernanke and continued by Ms. Yellen historically have drawn support from populist politicians in both parties. But Ms. Binder suggested that Republicans were attacking those policies in part because Democrats had supported the Fed's efforts to fight unemployment, and the polarization of national politics encouraged the parties to accentuate their differences.
"You now have these hard-money populists from the right who are concerned that monetary policy has been too lax and that the Fed needs to tighten," Ms. Binder said. "It's an inversion of what we might more typically see."
One proposal, which the House has passed twice in recent years, is known as "Audit the Fed." Backed by Senator Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican who is running for president, it would authorize the Government Accountability Office to review monetary policy decisions.
A stronger measure, backed by the Republican leadership of the House Financial Services Committee, would require the Fed to publish a mathematical formula that it planned to follow in raising and lowering interest rates. The Fed would then be required to explain deviations from the path prescribed by the formula.
There are also proposals to change the selection process for members of the Fed's policy-making committee, including a plan to strengthen the role of the banking industry in picking the presidents of the Fed's 12 regional reserve banks.
So far, however, none of the measures have gained traction in the Senate, where Democrats still have considerable power to stall legislation. And the White House has expressed general opposition to restrictions on the Fed's autonomy.
The Fed is charged by Congress with minimizing inflation and maximizing employment, a mandate formalized in 1978 by the Humphrey-Hawkins Act. Since the Great Recession, inflation has been unusually slow while jobs have been unusually scarce. Ms. Yellen and other Fed officials have described the Fed's actions as a necessary response to those circumstances.
Democrats, rallying to the Fed's defense, say the central bank is doing its best to fulfill its twin objectives, which can sometimes pull in opposite directions. Republicans, they say, are seeking to change its job description.
"The root of the issue at this point, I can sum it up in two words, Humphrey and Hawkins," said Barney Frank, the former Massachusetts congressman. "What you have is a vehement objection to the dual mandate. Many Republicans do understand that the atmospherics of repealing the unemployment part of the dual mandate would be very bad, but they are opposed to it philosophically."
Some Republicans are in favor of directing the Fed to focus solely on price stability, in line with the operating instructions for most central banks in developed nations, including the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan. The Republican senators Bob Corker of Tennessee and David Vitter of Louisiana introduced legislation in 2013 that directed the Fed to focus on keeping inflation low.
Bills being put forward now, however, do not attack the dual mandate directly. The proposal to make the Fed adopt a policy rule, for example, includes a baseline rule that incorporates both inflation and a measure of economic output. But that rule, known as the Taylor Rule, suggests that the Fed has kept interest rates near zero for too long, and the bill would require the Fed to justify that choice.
John Taylor, a professor of economics at Stanford University and the intellectual force behind the legislation, said that requiring the Fed to establish a policy rule would serve the same purpose as the checklists that some hospitals use to help doctors avoid errors.
"Practical experience and empirical studies show that checklist-free medical care is wrought with dangers just as rules-free monetary policy is," Mr. Taylor wrote in a recent defense of his proposal.
The proposal also is intended to increase the Fed's accountability. "What you want is something that permits you to see that the policies that are carried out are carried out for the benefit of the public," said Allan Meltzer, an economist at Carnegie Mellon University. "So choose your strategy, and we monitor you."
The House Financial Services Committee passed the legislation along party lines last year, but it went no further. The author, Representative Bill Huizenga, a Michigan Republican who heads the monetary policy subcommittee, said in a statement that he remained determined to "bring the Federal Reserve out of the shadows" and that he planned to introduce a modified version of the legislation later this year.
Fed officials say that they do consult rules in their deliberations, but that central banking is the art of knowing when to deviate from those rules. Mr. Bernanke said recently at the Brookings Institution that the Fed had articulated a policy rule: targeting 2 percent annual inflation and maximum employment.
"I don't think you can get much more precise than that because I don't think you can deal with the uncertainties that arise in actual policy-making," he said.
The legislation would allow the Fed to change its policy rule as often as it liked, but opponents of the measure still worry that it would inhibit the Fed's flexibility.
"Law can be very sticky," said Peter Conti-Brown, a scholar of central banking at Stanford Law School. "The thing that I fear about a statutory policy rule is that it would get stuck in inertia and make it very difficult to deviate even if there was a consensus among economists that there should be that deviation."
The current debate also has revived a struggle that dates to the Fed's creation in 1913. Republicans want to strengthen the independence of the Fed's regional reserve banks, whose presidents participate in monetary policy decisions, while Democrats want to strengthen the federal government's control.
Legislation introduced by Mr. Garrett would let the regional banks select their own boards and increase the banking industry's representation on those boards. It would also let the banks pick presidents without Washington's approval.
A countervailing bill introduced by Senator Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat, would make the president of the New York Fed a presidential nominee, subject to confirmation by the Senate. A coalition of community groups is pressuring the Fed to allow public input in the selection process for all regional Fed presidents.
Most of these proposals are revivals of earlier legislation, from earlier periods of frustration, and Mr. Conti-Brown said it was quite likely nothing would change.
"I think chances are strong that if the recovery holds, then even though the Fed after the crisis is a much bigger and more powerful institution, the Fed will slink back into the shadows," he said. "People like me are just going to be talking to other academics and central bankers and won't be talking to the public anymore."

Full text:   Expectations that the Federal Reserve will be slow to raise interest rates after a weak jobs report last week helped send the stock market up on Monday. A jump in the price of crude oil set off a rally in energy stocks.
The stock market was closed Friday when the Labor Department reported that employers added just 126,000 workers to their payrolls in March, the smallest increase since December 2013. It was another sign of weaker economic growth in winter and increased pressure on the Federal Reserve to delay raising rates from near zero. Low rates have helped stocks soar over the last six years.
David Lefkowitz, senior equity strategist at UBS, said that calming words from William Dudley, president of the New York Fed, encouraged investors. In a speech Monday morning, Mr. Dudley pointed to the recent shaky economic news and said he expected the Fed's rate increases would be "shallow."
"If Fed officials think the economy is not strong enough, they're not going to do anything to jeopardize the economic recovery," Mr. Lefkowitz said. "With inflation low and well contained the Fed can be patient. There's nothing forcing their hand."
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 13.66 points, or 0.7 percent, to close at 2,080.62. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 117.61 points, or 0.7 percent, to 17,880.85, and the Nasdaq rose 30.38 points, or 0.6 percent, to 4,917.32.
"Had the market been open on Friday, we would have probably had a triple-digit decline in the Dow," said Hank Smith, chief investment officer at Haverford Trust. "The fact that we had a weekend to digest put it in perspective."
Mr. Smith said he thought the economy was tracing a route laid in previous years when rough winters gave way to stronger springs.
"This is déjà vu," he said. "There was no polar vortex, like last year, but you clearly had weather in New England that was much more severe than last year."
The Institute for Supply Management reported Monday that companies in the service industry expanded at a slightly slower pace in March. The institute's services index slipped to 56.5 last month, from 56.9 in February. Any reading above 50 reflects growth.
Benchmark United States crude jumped an even $3, or 6 percent, to settle at $52.14 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. That set off a rally in energy-sector stocks. Transocean, an operator of drilling rigs, soared $1.52, or 10 percent, to $16.51.
Major markets in Europe were closed for Easter Monday. In Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 closed with a loss of 0.2 percent, while Seoul's Kospi gained 0.1 percent. India's Sensex surged 0.9 percent. Stock exchanges in Australia and China were also closed.
Back in the United States, Ventas announced plans to buy Ardent Medical Services, a privately owned hospital chain, for $1.75 billion and spin off most of its skilled-nursing facilities. Ventas, an investment trust focused on health care, surged $3.67, or 5 percent, to $76.90.
Government bond prices fell, driving the yield on the 10-year Treasury note up to 1.90 percent.

Full text:   BOULDER, Colo. -- ONCE upon a time in America, baby boomers paid for college with the money they made from their summer jobs. Then, over the course of the next few decades, public funding for higher education was slashed. These radical cuts forced universities to raise tuition year after year, which in turn forced the millennial generation to take on crushing educational debt loads, and everyone lived unhappily ever after.
This is the story college administrators like to tell when they're asked to explain why, over the past 35 years, college tuition at public universities has nearly quadrupled, to $9,139 in 2014 dollars. It is a fairy tale in the worst sense, in that it is not merely false, but rather almost the inverse of the truth.
The conventional wisdom was reflected in a recent National Public Radio series on the cost of college. "So it's not that colleges are spending more money to educate students," Sandy Baum of the Urban Institute told NPR. "It's that they have to get that money from someplace to replace their lost state funding -- and that's from tuition and fees from students and families."
In fact, public investment in higher education in America is vastly larger today, in inflation-adjusted dollars, than it was during the supposed golden age of public funding in the 1960s. Such spending has increased at a much faster rate than government spending in general. For example, the military's budget is about 1.8 times higher today than it was in 1960, while legislative appropriations to higher education are more than 10 times higher.
In other words, far from being caused by funding cuts, the astonishing rise in college tuition correlates closely with a huge increase in public subsidies for higher education. If over the past three decades car prices had gone up as fast as tuition, the average new car would cost more than $80,000.
Some of this increased spending in education has been driven by a sharp rise in the percentage of Americans who go to college. While the college-age population has not increased since the tail end of the baby boom, the percentage of the population enrolled in college has risen significantly, especially in the last 20 years. Enrollment in undergraduate, graduate and professional programs has increased by almost 50 percent since 1995. As a consequence, while state legislative appropriations for higher education have risen much faster than inflation, total state appropriations per student are somewhat lower than they were at their peak in 1990. (Appropriations per student are much higher now than they were in the 1960s and 1970s, when tuition was a small fraction of what it is today.)
As the baby boomers reached college age, state appropriations to higher education skyrocketed, increasing more than fourfold in today's dollars, from $11.1 billion in 1960 to $48.2 billion in 1975. By 1980, state funding for higher education had increased a mind-boggling 390 percent in real terms over the previous 20 years. This tsunami of public money did not reduce tuition: quite the contrary.
For example, when I was an undergraduate at the University of Michigan in 1980, my parents were paying more than double the resident tuition that undergraduates had been charged in 1960, again in inflation-adjusted terms. And of course tuition has kept rising far faster than inflation in the years since: Resident tuition at Michigan this year is, in today's dollars, nearly four times higher than it was in 1980.
State appropriations reached a record inflation-adjusted high of $86.6 billion in 2009. They declined as a consequence of the Great Recession, but have since risen to $81 billion. And these totals do not include the enormous expansion of the federal Pell Grant program, which has grown, in today's dollars, to $34.3 billion per year from $10.3 billion in 2000.
It is disingenuous to call a large increase in public spending a "cut," as some university administrators do, because a huge programmatic expansion features somewhat lower per capita subsidies. Suppose that since 1990 the government had doubled the number of military bases, while spending slightly less per base. A claim that funding for military bases was down, even though in fact such funding had nearly doubled, would properly be met with derision.
Interestingly, increased spending has not been going into the pockets of the typical professor. Salaries of full-time faculty members are, on average, barely higher than they were in 1970. Moreover, while 45 years ago 78 percent of college and university professors were full time, today half of postsecondary faculty members are lower-paid part-time employees, meaning that the average salaries of the people who do the teaching in American higher education are actually quite a bit lower than they were in 1970.
By contrast, a major factor driving increasing costs is the constant expansion of university administration. According to the Department of Education data, administrative positions at colleges and universities grew by 60 percent between 1993 and 2009, which Bloomberg reported was 10 times the rate of growth of tenured faculty positions.
Even more strikingly, an analysis by a professor at California Polytechnic University, Pomona, found that, while the total number of full-time faculty members in the C.S.U. system grew from 11,614 to 12,019 between 1975 and 2008, the total number of administrators grew from 3,800 to 12,183 -- a 221 percent increase.
The rapid increase in college enrollment can be defended by intellectually respectable arguments. Even the explosion in administrative personnel is, at least in theory, defensible. On the other hand, there are no valid arguments to support the recent trend toward seven-figure salaries for high-ranking university administrators, unless one considers evidence-free assertions about "the market" to be intellectually rigorous.
What cannot be defended, however, is the claim that tuition has risen because public funding for higher education has been cut. Despite its ubiquity, this claim flies directly in the face of the facts.

Full text:   TEHRAN -- As word made its way around the globe that an understanding had been reached with the United States and other powers to limit Iran's nuclear program, Iranians themselves greeted the news with optimism and skepticism on Friday.
While the political climate remained uncertain, the government was allowed to promote the deal at Friday Prayer, a sign that the plan was broadly supported by Iran's establishment.
In a nationally televised speech on Friday, Iran's president, Hassan Rouhani, a moderate, praised the deal as a development that "benefits everybody."
Answering some Western critics who question Tehran's credibility, he pledged that his country would keep its end of the bargain. "Any promise that we made and any promise that we will make, we will stand by it," he said. "We are not men of deception and hypocrisy."
Wading into an area that his foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, conspicuously avoided in the negotiations this week in Switzerland, Mr. Rouhani portrayed the nuclear deal as an Iranian opening to the world.
"It is not true to say that when the nuclear issue is over we will have nothing to do with the world," he said, calling it a first step toward "constructive interaction with the world."
Some predicted that hard-liners, who mostly kept quiet during the negotiations, would now mobilize for a fight. But business leaders, in particular, were elated at the prospect that a deal could soon mean the lifting of long years of economic sanctions.
"I jumped up and down of happiness," Rouzbeh Pirouz said by telephone. An Oxford-educated investment fund manager, Mr. Pirouz, 43, received the news just after landing on the Mediterranean island of Majorca.
"People in the terminal must have thought I was crazy," he added.
As details of the framework agreement were sifted here, however, the outlines of the deal was immediately criticized for what hard-liners called overly deep concessions by Iran.
"We should say in a word that we gave a saddled horse and received a torn bridle," the semiofficial news agency Fars quoted Hossein Shariatmadari, a vocal hard-liner who is editor in chief of the state newspaper Kayhan, as saying on Friday.
After finding out that Iran would be allowed to have only about 5,000 centrifuges, according to a fact sheet released by the State Department, Alireza Mataji, a 26-year-old student who has been allowed to organize events critical of the negotiations, posted on Twitter: "We will have just enough centrifuges left to make carrot juice."
There was no reaction from Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who in recent weeks has emphasized that all Iranians should support the negotiations. But now that a framework has been reached, analysts said that he would allow those criticizing a deal -- he might do so himself -- to voice their opposition.
"We can expect him to listen to all sides," said Saeed Laylaz, an economist close to the government of President Rouhani. "That means that we might even see hard-liners gaining more power in the coming months; on the other hand, it also might be different. We have to wait and see how this will play out.
"No matter how we try to sugarcoat it," Mr. Laylaz added, "this means we no longer will have an industrial-scale enrichment program. This is the price we have to pay for earlier mistakes."
Others also expressed disappointment about the terms for Iran and noted that the deal itself would do little to change the underlying differences with the United States.
"According to the U.S. interpretation, significant concessions have been made, and sanctions will not be removed in the way many here were expecting," said Mohammad Marandi, a professor of North American studies at Tehran University.
Mr. Marandi, who has been critical of the United States government, pointed at the rise of Saudi- and Turkish-backed extremism in the Middle East and emphasized that under current circumstances there could be no normal relationship with Washington.
"What we really want to see from the Americans is an end to their support of countries like Saudi Arabia and Turkey who support extremist groups," he said. "Make no mistake, the Middle East may soon explode, and we need a clear signal from the Americans to see where they stand."
At the important Friday Prayer session in Tehran, a bastion of hard-liners, there were the usual chants of "death to America," but efforts were also made to push the nuclear negotiations to a wider audience.
Mr. Rouhani's first adviser took the stage to give the pre-sermon speech and lauded the agreements made in Lausanne, Switzerland, as good achievements.
"Those who never wanted us to have the right to enrichment now agree we have that right," said the adviser, Mohammad Nahavandian. "Those who opposed us having the full fuel cycle now no longer oppose. Instead of sanctions, they now speak of cooperation. We have not retreated. Those opposing this deal are enemies, in line with the Zionists."
Worshipers basking in the spring sun were also optimistic.
"If it is in our national interest to make an understanding with the West, we should do it," said Mohsen Abdollahi, a cleric in a white turban on his way to the V.I.P. section of the prayer hall at Tehran University. "We can even stop shouting 'death to America' if it is needed."
Still, most in Tehran seem first and foremost to be hoping for a revival of the economy once the sanctions are lifted. Being able again to sell oil to the European Union and to have restrictions on sales to Asia lifted by the United States could bring in much-needed cash for Mr. Rouhani's government, Mr. Laylaz said.
Iranians appear also to be hoping for the strengthening of their currency, which has plummeted since sanctions, including those blocking bank transactions, were intensified. There is also the prospect of around $100 billion in frozen funds returning to the country.
"Still, I hope the government will be responsible and not start to inject all this cash into the economy, as inflation will skyrocket," Mr. Laylaz said. He added that many of Iran's economic problems were caused by mismanagement and corruption, not by sanctions.
Mr. Pirouz, the fund manager, had long ago bet on Iran to open up. It seemed, he said, that the moment was now very near.
His inbox was overflowing with messages of congratulations from well-known international funds that over the past year had shown interest in investing in Iran, he said.
"There now is the potential of lots of foreign investment coming into the country," said Mr. Pirouz, whose company, Turquoise Partners, is helping investors find their way into the Tehran Stock Exchange. "These are very exciting times."

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell unexpectedly last week, suggesting the labor market is expanding at a solid clip even as economic growth has stalled.
Sustained labor strength supports views that the sharp slowdown in activity is probably temporary. Several factors, including bad weather and a strong dollar, sucked momentum from the economy in the first quarter.
"While the economy has decelerated, the fundamentals remain strong, and the labor market points to a pickup in overall activity in the second quarter," said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at McGladrey in New York.
The economy, which has been hampered by weaker global demand and a now-settled labor dispute at the West Coast ports, as well as a strong dollar and a harsh winter, also was buoyed by an unexpected rise in factory orders in February.
In a separate report, the Commerce Department said new orders for manufactured goods increased 0.2 percent, ending six straight months of declines. Orders excluding transportation rose 0.8 percent. Orders for autos and auto parts fell 1.2 percent, and orders for private aircraft and aviation parts dropped 8.8 percent.
Tim Quinlan, a Wells Fargo Securities economist, said the "weakness in manufacturing has been overstated by a confluence of one-off factors," like the labor dispute and the weather. He said he expected better data soon, "but today's report wasn't it."
Downbeat first-quarter growth estimates got a lift from a second report from the Commerce Department showing the trade deficit narrowed 16.9 percent to $35.4 billion in February, the smallest since October 2009. When adjusted for inflation, the deficit narrowed to $50.8 billion in February from $54.6 billion in January.
Goldman Sachs raised its first-quarter growth forecast by three-tenths of a percentage point to a 1.0 percent rate, while the forecasting firm Macroeconomic Advisers lifted its estimate to a 1.2 percent rate from 0.9 percent. The economy grew at a 2.2 percent rate in the fourth quarter.
The buoyant dollar and sluggish global demand combined with greater domestic consumption suggest the smaller trade deficit is probably temporary.
"We will be looking for imports to pick up in the coming months, as consumer spending gains some momentum in the midst of rising employment levels," said Anthony Karydakis, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak in New York.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 20,000 to a seasonally adjusted 268,000 for the week that ended March 28, the lowest level since January, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Economists had forecast claims at 285,000. The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends because it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 14,750 to 285,500.
"The claims numbers simply do not support the idea that the first quarter slowdown in growth is indicative of some underlying malaise in the economy," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
The bullish labor market tone was also underscored by signs that more people are leaving the unemployment benefits rolls.
The number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid fell 88,000 to 2.33 million in the week ended March 21, the lowest reading since December 2000.
The strong labor market, with an anticipated acceleration in consumer spending signaled by a surge in auto sales last month, should keep the Federal Reserve on track to start raising interest rates this year.
The Fed has kept its short-term interest rate near zero since December 2008.
Prices for United States Treasury debt fell, while stocks on Wall Street rose. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies.
While the claims figures have no bearing on Friday's March employment report because they fall outside the survey period, they should help allay fears of a long-lasting moderation in growth.
Nonfarm payrolls most likely increased 245,000 last month, with the unemployment rate holding steady at a more than six-and-a-half-year low of 5.5 percent, according to a Reuters survey of economists.

Abstract: The Neue Galerie's "Gustav Klimt and Adele Bloch-Bauer: The Woman in Gold," which opened on Thursday, a day after the film, is a small exhibition centered on "Adele Bloch-Bauer I" and conveys the biography of the painting through vintage photographs of the principal players, sketchy preparatory drawings for Adele Bloch-Bauer's portrait and discursive text panels.

Full text:   In 2006, the art collector Ronald S. Lauder purchased Gustav Klimt's "Adele Bloch-Bauer I" (1907) for $135 million, then the highest price paid for a painting, and made it the crown jewel of the Neue Galerie, the museum he founded in 2001. Since then other paintings have sold for considerably higher sums, adjusted for inflation, including those by Paul Cézanne and Paul Gauguin.
If some of the luster was lost from Klimt's masterpiece as other works eclipsed its sale price, it is being renewed with the release of the movie "Woman in Gold." It tells the tale of how Adele Bloch-Bauer's niece, Maria Altmann (1916-2011), played by Helen Mirren, succeeded in gaining ownership of her aunt's portrait from the Austrian government decades after it was looted by the Nazis and displayed by the Belvedere in Vienna.
The Neue Galerie's "Gustav Klimt and Adele Bloch-Bauer: The Woman in Gold," which opened on Thursday, a day after the film, is a small exhibition centered on "Adele Bloch-Bauer I" and conveys the biography of the painting through vintage photographs of the principal players, sketchy preparatory drawings for Adele Bloch-Bauer's portrait and discursive text panels. The show also features seven other paintings by Klimt from private collections, including two pastoral landscapes; three small, lovely portraits of women; and "The Dancer" (1916-17), a near life-size picture of a standing woman enveloped in a floral-patterned dress. Rounding things out, an assortment of jewelry and decorative objects serves to typify the luxurious lifestyle of Adele and Ferdinand Bloch-Bauer, the art collectors who commissioned the portrait.
If you've never seen "Adele Bloch-Bauer I" in the flesh or would like to renew your acquaintance with it, now's probably not a good time, especially for the agoraphobic: There will be lines. Those who brave the crowd will behold the head and bare shoulders of a woman emerging from an opulent field of patterns rendered in gold and silver leaf. Her face is blurry and has a gray pallor accentuated by her upswept black hair and slightly enlivened by pink cheeks. She gazes out with sleepy eyes, a wide, Wiener Werkstätte-style choker wrapped around her elongated neck. She wears a slinky dress covered in a horizontally banded pattern of eyes and triangles and what appears to be an open cape bearing a patchwork pattern of rectangles. A background of gold and silver circles and spirals in different sizes creates an ethereal atmosphere. Clasping clawlike hands before her, she's a fin de siècle decadent dreamer, a Cassandra-like harbinger of events to come in the 20th century.
For all its optical dazzle and dreamy poetry, however, it's not one of the most exciting paintings of modern times. Flattened to the point of suffocation by its decorative excess, its erotic appeal chastely muted, it has a fusty, languid feeling. Were it not for what happened to it years after its completion, the work would not be nearly so famous as it is today.
Klimt started work on the portrait in 1903 and toiled for four years, after which it remained one of the most prized possessions of the Bloch-Bauer family. Here's where things got tricky. Before her death in 1925, Adele wrote in her final will that she wanted Ferdinand to donate her portrait, as well as a second portrait of her and four landscapes, all by Klimt, to the Austrian Gallery, the former name of the Belvedere.
After Germany's annexation of Austria in 1938, Ferdinand fled the country, leaving behind all his properties, including his art collection. Adele's portrait went to the Belvedere, where it remained for the rest of the 20th century. Ms. Altmann settled in California in 1942. She requested in 1998 that the Belvedere turn over to her the Klimts that were taken from the Bloch-Bauer collection, but the museum denied her based on Adele's will. Ms. Altmann didn't give up. In 1999 in the Central District of California, she sued the Republic of Austria and the Belvedere, seeking return of the paintings. The appeals process brought the case all the way to the United States Supreme Court, which decided in her favor in 2004. In 2006 Austria acceded to binding arbitration that gave Ms. Altmann the 1907 Adele portrait, which Mr. Lauder then purchased from her, and four other paintings that were sold at auction shortly thereafter.
Today, loaded with a history that even Klimt couldn't have imagined, the painting hangs at the intersection of debates about art and its value, whether aesthetic, spiritual or pecuniary. That it's been elevated to this highly visible position more because of extrinsic circumstances than for its intrinsic qualities is worth observing: It could just as well have been a different painting at the heart of the legal machinations. But it's uncannily apt, in light of the stratospheric prices some artworks sell for these days, that the disputed object happened to be a picture of a seductive woman clothed and embedded in gold, a symbol equally of the sacred and the profane.

Full text:   On Wednesday, McDonald's -- which has been facing demonstrations denouncing its low wages -- announced that it would give workers a raise. The pay increase won't, in itself, be a very big deal: the new wage floor is just $1 above the local minimum wage, and even that policy only applies to outlets McDonald's owns directly, not the many outlets owned by people who bought franchises. But it's at least possible that this latest announcement, like Walmart's much bigger pay-raise announcement a couple of months ago, is a harbinger of an important change in U.S. labor relations.
Maybe it's not that hard to give American workers a raise, after all.
Most people would surely agree that stagnant wages, and more broadly the shrinking number of jobs that can support middle-class status, are big problems for this country. But the general attitude to the decline in good jobs is fatalistic. Isn't it just supply and demand? Haven't labor-saving technology and global competition made it impossible to pay decent wages to workers unless they have a lot of education?
Strange to say, however, the more you know about labor economics the less likely you are to share this fatalism. For one thing, global competition is overrated as a factor in labor markets; yes, manufacturing faces a lot more competition than it did in the past, but the great majority of American workers are employed in service industries that aren't exposed to international trade. And the evidence that technology is pushing down wages is a lot less clear than all the harrumphing about a "skills gap" might suggest.
Even more important is the fact that the market for labor isn't like the markets for soybeans or pork bellies. Workers are people; relations between employers and employees are more complicated than simple supply and demand. And this complexity means that there's a lot more wiggle room in wage determination than conventional wisdom would have you believe. We can, in fact, raise wages significantly if we want to.
How do we know that labor markets are different? Start with the effects of minimum wages. There's a lot of evidence on those effects: Every time a state raises its minimum wage while neighboring states don't, it, in effect, performs a controlled experiment. And the overwhelming conclusion from all that evidence is that the effect you might expect to see -- higher minimum wages leading to fewer jobs -- is weak to nonexistent. Raising the minimum wage makes jobs better; it doesn't seem to make them scarcer.
How is that possible? At least part of the answer is that workers are not, in fact, commodities. A bushel of soybeans doesn't care how much you paid for it; but decently paid workers tend to do a better job, not to mention being less likely to quit and require replacement, than workers paid the absolute minimum an employer can get away with. As a result, raising the minimum wage, while it makes labor more expensive, has offsetting benefits that tend to lower costs, limiting any adverse effect on jobs.
Similar factors explain another puzzle about labor markets: the way different firms in what looks like the same business can pay very different wages. The classic comparison is between Walmart (with its low wages, low morale, and very high turnover) and Costco (which offers higher wages and better benefits, and makes up the difference with better productivity and worker loyalty). True, the two retailers serve different markets; Costco's merchandise is higher-end and its customers more affluent. But the comparison nonetheless suggests that paying higher wages costs employers a lot less than you might think.
And this, in turn, suggests that it shouldn't be all that hard to raise wages across the board. Suppose that we were to give workers some bargaining power by raising minimum wages, making it easier for them to organize, and, crucially, aiming for full employment rather than finding reasons to choke off recovery despite low inflation. Given what we now know about labor markets, the results might be surprisingly big -- because a moderate push might be all it takes to persuade much of American business to turn away from the low-wage strategy that has dominated our society for so many years.
There's historical precedent for this kind of wage push. The middle-class society now dwindling in our rearview mirrors didn't emerge spontaneously; it was largely created by the "great compression" of wages that took place during World War II, with effects that lasted for more than a generation.
So can we repeat this achievement? The pay raises at Walmart and McDonald's -- brought on by a tightening job market plus activist pressure -- offer a small taste of what could happen on a vastly larger scale. There's no excuse for wage fatalism. We can give American workers a raise if we want to.

Full text:   TEHRAN -- Even after learning about a politically seismic event -- a nuclear agreement that could augur an end to the era of sanctions and shouts of "Death to America" -- many Iranians appeared reluctant to express happiness or even react to what was, for most people, heartening news.
"We have been disappointed so many times, I can't really believe there might be an end to this," said Mohammad Reza, 21.
The streets of Tehran, a city of 12 million, crowded on any regular evening, were largely empty late Thursday night, save for some gatherings at a central square where people honked their car horns in approval.
But that may have been partly because many Iranians were glued to state television, watching President Obama in Washington talking about the details of a framework nuclear accord with Iran. It appeared to be the first time in Iran's revolutionary history that the official news media broadcast the speech of an American president live and in full.
"This is unbelievable," said Mohammad Javad Mehreghan, a financial expert. "Soon we will have direct flights between Tehran and New York."
Iran's president, Hassan Rouhani, who won the 2013 election promising to mend the country's ties with the rest of the world, said on Twitter that he had congratulated his foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, and the rest of the negotiating team for their "tireless efforts around the clock."
There was no immediate reaction from Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader, or from his office. The ayatollah, who has the final word on the deal, has often stated that he trusts Iran's negotiators to make decisions, but warned them not to cross "red lines."
Many in Iran have spent the past week following the news, but also expressing doubt that there would ever be a solution. The sanctions have cut deeply into the lives of ordinary people, contributing to an inflation rate that has exceeded 40 percent, slashing buying power and generally casting a blanket of depression over the nation of 70 million.
As the idea of a future without sanctions started to sink in, some became emotional.
"I was crying with happiness. It is unbelievable," said Elnaz Karimi, 37, a commercial manager.
The company she worked for had lost business, she said, as international financial transactions became prohibitively expensive.
"Now we can use this money we would spend on trying to do business on investments," she said.
Analysts and commentators from across the political spectrum welcomed the agreement.
Iranian officials called the agreement a "statement" and a "solution," in keeping with Mr. Khamenei's pronouncement that any deal would have to lift all sanctions in one step. The American negotiators had preferred a step-by-step approach, but the Iranians seem to have gotten their way, for the most part.
"The solutions are good for all as they stand," Mr. Zarif said on Twitter. "There is no need to spin using 'fact sheets' so early on."
Reviving the economy is now the primary issue for most people. Mr. Rouhani has been leading an effort to bring down inflation, while the end of sanctions might mean a return to oil production of more than two million barrels per day, only half what Iran once produced but twice its output in recent years.
"We need to wait for the final deal to be signed in order to see the positive effects on our economy," said Hamidreza Taraghi, an analyst close to Ayatollah Khamenei. "But all in all, this statement is close to what we have been expecting."
Nader Karimi Joni, a journalist and former member of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, said European companies would come back and invest. He added, "The future looks bright."

Full text:   Last week, a 21-year-old soccer player named Harry Kane made a spectacular debut for England's national team, scoring against Lithuania just 79 seconds after entering the game and then wheeling away with a look of joyous disbelief as a crowd of roughly 80,000 countrymen roared approval.
Mr. Kane's unexpected emergence this season as the leading scorer for his club team, Tottenham Hotspur, has captivated fans -- not least because he was born and raised a few miles from Tottenham's north London stadium.
It has also made him a beacon of an anti-globalization groundswell that aims to restrict the participation of foreign players in England's soccer leagues.
"How many other Harry Kanes are there in the academies of English football who cannot get a first-team game?" Greg Dyke, chairman of English soccer's governing body, the Football Association, wrote in an opinion article published by The Guardian. "We are simply not giving young domestic talent sufficient opportunities at the highest level of English football."
Mr. Dyke put his concerns into broader and blunter form last week in announcing proposed limits on the participation of foreign players. The country's top league, the Premier League, he declared, was headed toward being "owned by foreigners, managed by foreigners and played by foreigners."
Economists have long held up soccer -- which has become one of the most globalized markets for skilled labor -- as a shining example of the benefits of open borders. The Premier League now draws capital and labor from around the world, and produces a spectacle consumed around the world. That's why Tottenham's jerseys feature the logo of AIA, an Asian-based insurance company that doesn't even have offices in England. And economists say that's good for the players, their countries -- and for England.
As in the United States, however, this expert consensus has largely failed to shift public opinion. The recruitment of skilled foreigners to take jobs once held by English players feeds into deep anxieties about the inflow of immigrants in a country that has never seen itself as a melting pot. A recent Ipsos MORI poll found that 45 percent of Britons regard immigration as the top issue facing the country ahead of national elections in May.
The basic argument is straightforward. There are only 500 player jobs in the Premier League -- 20 teams, each with 25 players. Two decades ago, Englishmen held about 69 percent of those jobs. Last season, they held 37 percent, according to data compiled by CIES Football Observatory. By contrast, 61 percent of players in the Spanish league were Spanish; 59 percent of players in the German league were German.
The Championship, the second tier of English soccer, has also become notably less English. English players accounted for less than half of the total minutes played during the early months of the current season, the BBC calculated.
And Mr. Dyke and his supporters say England's national team is struggling because fewer players have the chance to learn their trade at the highest levels. Tottenham loaned Mr. Kane to four teams between 2011 and 2013 while employing a series of expensive imports in the job he now holds. Mr. Dyke says other talented English players may similarly be languishing in reserve.
Mr. Dyke has convinced the government to impose new limits on the supply of foreign players, by making it harder to get work permits. He also wants to limit demand for them, by persuading teams to reserve more of their 25 roster slots for homegrown players.
The effort is a version of what economists call "import substitution" -- raising barriers at the border to encourage the development of domestic industry. It is a strategy developing nations have used with success -- including, once upon a time, Britain and the United States, and, more recently, China.
But England is not developing a new industry. Soccer was invented there. And there are some important reasons to doubt the gut-feeling argument that foreign players are bad for the English game. The league itself is hugely profitable, and much of that money arrives in England from other countries. Rich foreigners buy teams. Companies buy sponsorships. Fans buy jerseys.
"The Premier League has become the most successful product in sporting history," said Simon Kuper, co-author of "Soccernomics," a 2014 book that uses data to examine the game's development. And the English league has become the world's most popular, outstripping leagues in Spain and Germany and Italy, in large part because it has become the most global.
The league's success means that the remaining English players earn much more than their predecessors -- so much more that English players, in aggregate, are almost certainly taking home more money. The average salary this season is 2.3 million pounds (about $3.4 million), according to a Daily Mail survey. In 1992-93, the first season of the current league structure, the average was just 140,000 pounds (about $208,000), after adjusting for inflation.
The Premier League also makes direct payments to England's minor leagues. It buys players from minor league teams. And every year, three teams from the second division are promoted to the Premier League, while three Premier League teams move down. Since 1992, 46 different teams have enjoyed at least one season of windfall Premier League profits.
Players in the second flight now earn 486,000 pounds on average (about $721,000) -- or more than three times as much, after inflation, as top-flight players two decades ago.
Mr. Kane and his peers, in other words, are beneficiaries of globalization.
The fans arguably are beneficiaries, too. They get to watch better players and better games, and their hometown teams are among the giants of global soccer. Manchester citizens may take pride in the success of Manchester United or Manchester City, even if few of the teams' players have been English in recent years.
The globalization of soccer began to accelerate in 1995 when a Belgian player, Jean-Marc Bosman, convinced the European Court of Justice that European Union nations could not impose limits on the employment of European Union soccer players.
The effect was much broader. The year before the ruling, just 6 percent of the players in top European leagues came from outside Europe. Four years later, the share had climbed to 28 percent, according to a 2014 analysis by Chrysovalantis Vasilakis, an economist at the Catholic University of Louvain in Belgium.
Mr. Vasilakis and other economists see evidence that globalization has increased the competitive balance of international competitions like the World Cup, as players from smaller and less affluent countries, such as Ghana and Uruguay, have more opportunities at the game's highest levels. That suggests England and other traditional powers are losing ground, in relative terms, because they now face stiffer competition.
But it's hard to see the evidence in the performance of England's national team. During the Premier League era, the team has held a relatively steady position in FIFA's ranking of national teams, with an average ranking of 10th. England's performance at the World Cup has also remained relatively constant, although fans inevitably pine for a repeat of 1966, when England hosted and won the Cup.
Charles Kenny, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development, notes that English players also benefit from the improved competition in the Premier League.
And Mr. Kenny, who is English, says he has no appetite for stepping on the prospects of other nations. "Does England really want to stay ahead in the global game by keeping other national teams down?" he said. "That seems an awfully colonial attitude."

McDonald's to Raise Pay at Outlets It Operates

Abstract: According to Paul Secunda of Marquette University Law School, a joint employer finding would mean franchise employees hoping to improve their working conditions have the right to bring McDonald's to the bargaining table, rather than negotiating only with the franchises.

Full text:   McDonald's announced on Wednesday that it would raise wages and offer new benefits to 90,000 employees in the 1,500 outlets in the United States that it owns and operates, responding to competitive pressure from a tighter job market and to labor campaigns drawing public attention to its pay policies.
The decision, however, does not affect the 750,000 employees who work for the more than 3,100 franchisees that operate roughly 12,500 McDonald's restaurants around the country.
The company will increase wages to at least $1 over the local legal minimum wage for workers in restaurants under corporate control to an average of $9.90 an hour by July 1. That average will increase to more than $10 in 2016.
Employees who have worked in company restaurants more than a year will also be eligible for paid time off, whether they work full or part time. An employee who works an average of 20 hours a week might accrue as much as 20 hours of paid time off a year, the company said.
McDonald's will also expand a program intended to help employees of both its own restaurants and those operated by franchisees to take classes online toward earning high school diplomas. The company will cover those costs, as well as assist employees with college tuition.
"We know that a motivated work force leads to better customer service, so we believe this initial step not only benefits our employees, it will improve McDonald's restaurant experience," Steve Easterbrook, who has been chief executive for one month, said in a statement.
The decision was the boldest move yet by Mr. Easterbrook, who broke the news in an interview with The Wall Street Journal.
Mr. Easterbrook has acted quickly to introduce changes aimed at improving McDonald's standing with consumers. This week, the company announced plans to offer breakfast all day and to retool a grilled chicken sandwich to use an "artisan" bun and remove ingredients like maltodextrin.
The company's sales in outlets open at least a year were down 4 percent in February, one of the worst performances among the largest restaurants that publicly report their sales.
Several large companies that have direct contact with consumers have raised wages over the last year, including Walmart, the TJX Companies and Ikea. There was a risk that McDonald's could lose its better employees to other companies that compete for low-wage workers. Many of its franchisees face similar challenges, which could ultimately lead to broader wage gains at other McDonald's fast-food outlets.
Mark Kalinowski, an investment analyst who follows McDonald's at Janney Montgomery Scott, said a restaurant executive he met with recently said he would have to raise wages to keep employees as the labor market improves.
"McDonald's said that one of the reasons they're doing this is because of competitiveness, and there's no reason why their franchisees wouldn't be feeling that same competitive pressure," Mr. Kalinowski said.
McDonald's has been under fire for some time from labor groups fighting for a base wage of $15 an hour. Employees and their supporters have held one-day rallies outside restaurants. The Service Employees International Union has been spending millions in a campaign to organize McDonald's employees and others to press for higher wages, and it plans to hold an array of protest rallies across the country on April 15.
The announcement comes as several National Labor Relations Board cases are getting underway based on accusations that McDonald's is liable for reported labor violations by some of its franchisees.
At issue before an N.L.R.B. judge is whether McDonald's is a "joint employer" of the workers its franchises hire, in that it exercises meaningful control over their workplace.
According to Paul Secunda of Marquette University Law School, a joint employer finding would mean franchise employees hoping to improve their working conditions have the right to bring McDonald's to the bargaining table, rather than negotiating only with the franchises.
While this would not in itself make franchise workers eligible for higher wages, it could help them pressure the company, forcing it to explain why it treats similar employees differently.
"They'll say, 'Someone at the company is doing the exact same job I'm doing at a franchisee, with the same cost of living, and they're getting paid $10 an hour and I'm getting $8.50,' " said Professor Secunda. "It's a hard argument to respond to. Is it because you want the franchises to be more profitable than you?"
Karen King, senior vice president and chief people officer in the company's United States division, said in an interview that the announcement was not timed to anything in particular.
"Something like this takes us a long time to do," Ms. King said. "We're too big and complicated a system to do anything in reaction to a particular group or something happening."
She said the decision came after a survey of its 90,000 employees late last summer showed that their primary priority was better wages and benefits.
"What we're doing is just one of many actions we have underway," Ms. King said. "We are and will be a modern, progressive burger restaurant, and this is just one step toward that goal."
Labor organizers were not impressed with the changes Mr. Easterbrook announced, noting that they fell far short of workers' goals and left out most McDonald's workers.
"Even for those employees who will benefit, the rate adjustment will still leave many hovering around the poverty line," Christine L. Owens, executive director of the National Employment Law Project, said in a statement.
Ms. Owens noted that McDonald's had almost $5 billion in profit last year and paid its chief executive $13.8 million in 2012. "McDonald's can and should do much better," she said.
Workers in a conference call organized by the Fight for $15 campaign dismissed the announcement as a public relations stunt.
"Is this an April Fool's Day joke?" asked Justin Johnson, 21, who works at a McDonald's in St. Louis and who said he made $7.60 an hour. "After two years of campaigning, McDonald's raises wages for less than 10 percent of their workers -- and only 10 percent of the way toward a living wage?"
Despite the rising pressure to lift wages, many McDonald's franchisees will be torn over whether to go along with the increases at company-owned outlets. Some of the changes the company has been making add cost and complexity to restaurant operations, and franchisees are restive. The company held a special meeting with them in Las Vegas last month, though it said nothing there about its plans to increase wages.
But whatever their legal responsibility, franchise owners are likely to feel pressure to raise wages as well, particularly those whose restaurants are near company-owned outlets, which tend to be concentrated in urban areas.
"It forces the franchisees to raise wages, which means they will raise prices -- which in turn will increase revenues for the corporation," said Richard Adams, a former franchisee who runs a consulting firm for franchise holders. "That's what this is all about -- it's corporate-mandated inflation."
Franchisees rarely speak without permission from McDonald's because their contract with the company is written so broadly that the company can punish them for virtually anything they say. One franchisee who spoke on condition of anonymity about Wednesday's announcement said that business in his restaurants had been "horrible" and that he did not see how he could increase his employees' pay.
And many are worried about the plans to serve breakfast all day. "The grills in the restaurants can't accommodate all-day breakfast orders and keep up with orders for meals during the rest of the day," Mr. Kalinowski, the analyst, said.

Full text:   WITH tax day looming, you can practically hear the cries of creative professionals across the country. That's because the tax code hits many right where it hurts, by penalizing them for the distinctive way they make money.
The biggest offender is still the alternative minimum tax, despite the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which brought long-overdue reform. Two provisions of the A.M.T. hit a disproportionate number of actors, screenwriters and directors: In calculating it, taxpayers can't deduct employee business expenses, nor can they deduct state, local and property taxes.
Most unionized entertainment professionals receive their income as wages, which means that on paper, they're employees. But unlike most other groups of workers, entertainers must pay a hefty chunk of their income (around 30 percent) to obtain and negotiate work. This is in the form of commissions to agents (10 percent), managers (10 to 20 percent) and lawyers (5 percent); job-seeking travel; office or rehearsal-studio rental; business meals; union dues; coaching and classes; advertising and publicity; and research materials.
Because of where their work is concentrated, entertainment workers also tend to live in high-tax states like New York, Illinois and California. (Their unions have about 250,000 members, though not all are always working.) The Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center projects that in 2014, about twice as many residents of high-tax states as low-tax state residents will get hit with A.M.T.
If you think it's now only a bourgeois problem, you're wrong. The 2012 law raised the exemption amounts (for 2014 they were $52,800 for individuals and $82,100 for married couples filing jointly), but the Tax Policy Center estimates that almost a million "tax units" earning between $50,000 and $200,000 per year will have some A.M.T. burden this tax day.
So a married actor with two kids who earns $60,000 from acting wages could get hit with A.M.T. If she does, she can wind up paying tax on money she never really sees (like commission expenses, which she has to count as income and cannot deduct as a business expense). Meanwhile, her talent agency and management firm are also paying taxes on that same money.
Entertainers who earn freelance income in addition to their wage income -- say, from modeling jobs -- have some protection even if they owe A.M.T., because they can still deduct their Schedule C business expenses. But not all of them have freelance income, just wages from a combination of entertainment and day jobs.
One way to avoid the A.M.T. madness (and other tax penalties for creative workers) is to form a corporation, which makes nearly all business expenses and state and local taxes deductible. But it can cost several thousand dollars to do that. The rule of thumb is that it makes sense only for people earning over $200,000 a year -- but many creative professionals are unwilling to take this gamble on their future earnings, because their work is by nature insecure (or maybe they are).
While the tax code is penalizing middle- and upper-middle-class creatives, it's no kinder to their working-class counterparts.
In 1986, thanks to lobbying by the entertainment unions, the Internal Revenue Service gave a tax break to performers. Called the "qualified performing artist" provision, it allows certain low-income performers to receive a dollar-for-dollar deduction for business expenses. But to qualify, the adjusted gross income (from all sources) was capped at $16,000 -- for individuals or for married people filing jointly. Since 1986, that figure has never been indexed ($16,000 then is about $34,000 today).
Because the income cap remains so low, a provision designed to help low-income actors now mainly helps child actors and older actors. In 2008, Senators Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, and Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, co-sponsored a bill to raise the adjusted gross income cap and index it to inflation, but the bill died and hasn't come up again since.
In a country where most artists struggle to pay the bills, the government can do better than encourage them to form costly and unwieldy corporations. Congress should eliminate the A.M.T. and find other ways to make sure the rich pay their taxes. The middle- and upper-middle-class problem with A.M.T. will continue to get worse; the number of $50,000 to $200,000 tax units who owe it is projected to go up about 20 percent by 2023.
Until the A.M.T. is eliminated, the tax code should allow entertainers, irrespective of income, to subtract commissions from their gross income. Congress should also index the qualified performing artist cap to inflation and allow married performers filing jointly to qualify as long as the household income doesn't exceed twice the cap (a married actor could have a household adjusted gross income of $68,000, for example).
Finally, Congress should take a cue from countries like Sweden, Germany and the Netherlands, and allow income averaging for artists -- which Congress got rid of in 1986 for everyone but farmers, fishermen and certain retirees.
All those shows you're binge-watching exist because of the labor of people who don't earn red-carpet salaries. It's hard enough for them to earn a living wage in the arts. Let's not slam them on their taxes, too.

Eurozone Inflation Falls Again, as Unemployment Dipst

Abstract: The market, he said, was focusing on the performance gap between the United States, where the Federal Reserve seems to be moving toward raising interest rates, and Europe, where the European Central Bank has its work cut out trying to hold off deflationary pressures.

Full text:   PARIS -- The eurozone continues to flirt with deflation, an official report showed on Tuesday, as consumer prices fell in March for a fourth consecutive month. A separate report, though, showed the unemployment rate in the zone, a 19-nation currency union, dipping slightly in February.
While the data gave little reason to cheer, the reports did not alter the view that Europe, despite its problems, is experiencing a miniboom, lifted by low oil prices, a weak euro and aggressive stimulus from the European Central Bank.
Consumer prices fell 0.1 percent from a year earlier, Eurostat, the statistical agency of the European Union, reported from Luxembourg. The inflation rate turned negative in December, falling to as low as minus 0.6 percent in January. Energy prices in March led the decline, falling 5.8 percent from a year earlier.
The latest reports "did not lift the threat of a prolonged period of deflation in the currency union," Jonathan Loynes, chief European economist at Capital Economics, said in a research note. He pointed out that the "core" inflation rate, which strips out volatile food and energy costs, actually fell to 0.6 percent from 0.7 percent. The latest reading was the lowest since Eurostat began measuring it in 1997.
Fearing the effect that too-low prices could have on the economy, the European Central Bank has undertaken a policy of quantitative easing, under which it will buy up to 60 billion euros, or about $65 billion, a month of bonds, including sovereign debt. The central bank is trying to raise inflation to its target of just less than 2 percent, a level not reached since January 2013.
Tuesday's inflation and jobless figures were in line with economists' expectations. Eurostat said that the jobless rate in the eurozone fell to 11.3 percent in February from an upwardly revised 11.4 percent in January. That was the lowest unemployment rate for the region since May 2012, but there has been little to suggest that hiring is about to take off.
Mr. Loynes noted that unemployment "remains very high by historical standards," not far from the record 12.1 percent reached in 2013, "signaling the persistence of a large amount of spare capacity in the labor market."
Some economists took heart over the fact that the decline in overall consumer prices had slowed, suggesting that inflation could turn positive again soon, especially if the downturn in energy costs was not sustained. But the measure that matters most to policy makers, core inflation, is still moving in the wrong direction.
The lower core rate reinforced expectations that the central bank would keep pushing policies that effectively weaken the euro. The currency, which has lost more than 11 percent of its value against the dollar this year, fell 0.9 percent after the reports to $1.0737 on Tuesday afternoon in trading in Paris. The eurozone equity benchmark index Euro Stoxx 50 was down nearly 1 percent.
Derek Halpenny, senior currency economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ in London, said the market had taken the European data in stride. The market, he said, was focusing on the performance gap between the United States, where the Federal Reserve seems to be moving toward raising interest rates, and Europe, where the European Central Bank has its work cut out trying to hold off deflationary pressures.
"The momentum seems to have shifted back to selling the euro," Mr. Halpenny said. "The primary element of that is what's happening inside the United States, and that hasn't changed at all."
Although declines in the price of commodities like oil can act as a stimulus, economists fear a generalized decline in price levels, known as deflation, could sap growth and make life harder for borrowers. International Monetary Fund economists had argued since even before consumer prices turned negative that Europe's inflation was too low.
Fitch Ratings warned in a report on Monday that eurozone deflation was "the largest potential risk" to global corporate credit ratings because the region's weight in the world economy meant that falling prices and economic weakness there "will have knock-on effects on other regions."
Still, a gauge of economic output based on a private survey of purchasing managers last week showed the eurozone economy expanding at its fastest rate since May 2011. And a report on Monday from the European Commission showed consumer and business confidence at their strongest in about four years.
Economists describe the upturn as a cyclical recovery, noting that important indicators are showing strength, despite the failure of the currency bloc to grow at its potential rate. The eurozone economy has still not recovered its pre-2008 crisis levels, and growth has been too weak to generate the jobs needed to break decisively with the crisis era.
Taking the bloc as a whole, however, obscures the fact that member states are diverging widely in their performance. The jobless rate in Germany, the biggest eurozone member, is just 4.8 percent, less than one-fourth that of the bloc's fourth-largest member, Spain, which at 23.2 percent, has a rate consistent with an economic depression.
Italy, the third-largest member, reported an increase to 12.7 percent in its jobless rate, a record. Unemployment in France, the second-largest economy in the eurozone, stood at 10.6 percent, little changed for months.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Abstract: Applications are down only 2.9 percent so far this year from last year, according to the Law School Admissions Council, and it seems as if the law school entry class is likely to stabilize around 37,000 students -- or back to 1970s levels. The National Association for Law Placement found that in 2013, only 86.4 percent of law school graduates were still in school or had a job, down from a 25-year high of 91.9 percent in 2010.

Full text:   Law school enrollment has plummeted to the lowest level in decades. If a bottom has been reached, is now a good time to go to law school?
Some say no -- not now and possibly never. The legal market, they argue, has fundamentally changed, meaning that many of the legal jobs of years past are gone forever.
Several new studies, however, point to signs of vigorous life in the legal job market, at least toward the higher end.
First, it needs to be recognized that the recent decline in law school enrollment is partly a problem of the schools' own making. Some law schools have fudged the numbers on graduates' employment to manipulate The U.S. News and World Report annual rankings. At the same time, there has been a growing awareness of law school graduates who have no job but a mountain of student debt. It is hardly surprising that there has been intense criticism from blogs and other outlets.
Students fled, and law school enrollment plummeted. In 2010, enrollment peaked at 52,488 before falling to 37,924 this year, a 27.7 percent decrease, according to the American Bar Association. Here is where it starts to look a bit better for law schools.
Early figures show that applications for this year may be stabilizing. Prof. Brian Leiter of the University of Chicago Law School predicts a "bottom." Applications are down only 2.9 percent so far this year from last year, according to the Law School Admissions Council, and it seems as if the law school entry class is likely to stabilize around 37,000 students -- or back to 1970s levels.
The smaller classes will begin graduating this year and continue to shrink through 2018. Fewer lawyers are likely to mean better first-job numbers, assuming the employment market does not keep declining.
And indeed, green shoots can be seen in the legal industry.
The top global law firms ranked in the annual AmLaw 100 survey experienced a 4.3 percent increase in revenue in 2013 and a 5.4 percent increase in profit. Bigger firms are hiring. Above the Law, a website for lawyers, recently reported a rising trend for lateral moves for lawyers in New York.
At the top law schools, things are returning to the years before the financial crisis. Last year, 93.2 percent of the 645 students of the Georgetown Law class of 2013 were employed. Sixty percent of the 2013 graduates were in the private sector with a median starting salary of $160,000. The top 10 schools have even higher employment rates for the class of 2010, and employment statistics for 2014 are expected to rise. (Full disclosure: I teach at one of those top 10 schools and so am biased here.)
This is not to say that things are all rosy. The National Association for Law Placement found that in 2013, only 86.4 percent of law school graduates were still in school or had a job, down from a 25-year high of 91.9 percent in 2010. The association also noted a shift in employment from big firm jobs to lower-paid jobs at small firms as well as to jobs that did not require a law degree.
A new study, however, provides a compelling reason to be optimistic about a career in law. Two professors, Frank McIntyre and Michael Simkovic, recently released a study of lawyer salaries from 1984 to 2013 with the goal of seeing whether students who graduated in a down economy suffered long-term negative effects.
The co-authors found that unemployment in a bad economy hit lawyers in the first four years of their career, lowering the amount of money they made relative to similarly educated people who did not go to law school. Yet law salaries can climb rapidly. In another paper, the two authors found that such acceleration in compensation results in a premium of $1 million for lawyers over their lifetime compared with those who did not go to law school. Based on this growth and the ability to eventually find lucrative employment, the two authors found that over a 30-year period, the hit from early unemployment and a bad economy fades as times get better and graduates gain experience. Indeed, the lawyers caught up so much that the two found that "timing" law school -- starting law school in a bad or good economy -- did not matter.
Another study released last fall by the American Bar Foundation supports the authors' findings. The foundation's After the JD project surveyed lawyers who passed the bar in 2000 to assess their career trajectory 10 years after graduation. The foundation found that as of 2012, lawyers had high levels of job satisfaction and employment as well as high salaries. Even graduates with low grades from low-ranked law schools had median incomes in the $85,000 to $95,000 range. This follows the fact that law firm salaries have risen by more than inflation since 1995, according to the National Association for Law Placement.
Even as signs point toward improvement, forecasts of doom for law schools continue to emerge. Dorothy A. Brown, an Emory law professor, recently wrote that "law schools are in a death spiral" and that "in three years, a top law school will close."
Her solution is to turn away from legal scholarship and reduce professor research budgets to further lower tuition.
Never mind the fact that not a single law school has closed so far or that law schools have been racing to shed professors and staff as well as tuition. The University of Iowa, Roger Williams University, Brooklyn Law School, Pace University, Penn State and others have cut tuition, while faculty buyouts have become more frequent. Sticker price discounts on even reduced tuition are common.
Law schools have tremendous survival tendencies. I have a bet with Jordan Weissmann at Slate that not a single law school will close. So far, we have had one merger -- between William Mitchell College of Law and Hamline University School of Law -- which satisfies Mr. Weissman of Slate that he has won the bet. But there have been no real closures. And so, while my crystal ball is as good as anyone's, I'm still betting there will be no such closures, and certainly none by top law schools.
The most compelling argument against going to law school is a structural one. Yes, the job market goes in cycles and we may be at the beginning of an upswing, but, the argument goes, the market itself has been transformed.
For one, corporate in-house legal teams are growing, replacing the work that outside firms once did. Microsoft, for example, has more than 500 in-house lawyers. More significant, automation is hurting small practitioners and eating up the bread-and-butter work of big firms, like discovery review.
Big firms are quite profitable, but in exchange for the profitability, there is more hard work and uncertainty about job security, even for partners.
Still, it is hard to see lawyers going away in the United States economy. Whether or not you like it, their importance is greater now in terms of filling needs for compliance and regulation.
So, there will be disruptions, but this is likely to be a case of lawyers shifting from law firms to corporate departments and compliance becoming its own industry. Solo practice, meanwhile, will become more difficult because of automation. Again, these changes are likely to hit students at lower-tier schools harder than those graduating from the top schools.
Twenty years from now, whether the economy is up or down, there will still be lawyers, and plenty of them.

Abstract: The testing model envisions growth in China's gross domestic product falling to about 1.6 percent, from 7 percent; the British economy contracting 2.3 percent, with unemployment spiking to 9.3 percent; growth in global G.D.P. dropping by 0.7 percent; and the Bank of England's lowering benchmark interest rates to zero from the current 0.5 percent rate.

Full text:   LONDON -- The Bank of England said on Monday that it would test major British banks on their potential performance against financial shocks including a global slowdown, a sharp drop in inflation and a reduction in worldwide appetite for risk.
This year's test is intended to better reflect the global risks and how those would filter through the system, affecting banks' capital. It will not include a default by Greece, a Greek exit from the eurozone or Britain's potentially leaving the European Union. The contagion effects that a Greek default might cause, like a liquidity crisis in emerging markets, are taken into account, Bank of England officials said.
The purpose of the test is to measure the soundness of Britain's banks against severe economic and financial market upheavals, as occurred in 2008. The first such stress test by the British central bank, in 2014, focused more on British risks, including the level of indebtedness of British households.
Important differences this year include adding an international focus and taking into account what happens to banks' illiquid or untradable positions under such stresses.
Releasing the parameters of its 2015 test, the British central bank said that under certain situations, banks would have to maintain a 4.5 percent common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, and a 3 percent Tier 1 leverage ratio. Both ratios are measures of a bank's capital.
The test in 2014 envisioned the pound falling, rising inflation, interest rates spiking to 4 percent, unemployment reaching 12 percent and the economy shrinking 3.5 percent. In that test, one bank failed, one came close to failing and another was forced to raise capital to improve its position.
The 2015 version will try to take into account a wider array of global risks, which have risen sharply since the previous evaluation.
"By assessing the resilience of the U.K. banking system against a major external shock, we will improve further our ability to identify vulnerabilities and we will ensure that banks have plans in place to address a wider range of possible stresses," Mark J. Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, said on Monday in a statement.
The stress test is not a forecast, but a way to measure banks against unlikely but severe events.
The testing model envisions growth in China's gross domestic product falling to about 1.6 percent, from 7 percent; the British economy contracting 2.3 percent, with unemployment spiking to 9.3 percent; growth in global G.D.P. dropping by 0.7 percent; and the Bank of England's lowering benchmark interest rates to zero from the current 0.5 percent rate.
Among the conditions imagined in the test, liquidity in the market is impaired as investors race to dump risky assets and buy high-quality ones in the United States. This causes an appreciation of the dollar and a devaluation of other currencies, including the Chinese renminbi.
Lenders are also required to test how they would react if five other major banks defaulted.
In the euro area, the test model imagines weaker demand and falling commodity prices leading to an increase in the rate of deflation. Emerging markets would then suffer, slowing capital inflows and leading to a sharp contraction of domestic credit and demand. In Britain, consumption and investment fall. Residential property prices decline 20 percent and commercial property drops 35 percent.
The banks are to publish their results in December. Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds Banking Group, Nationwide, the Royal Bank of Scotland, Santander UK and Standard Chartered will take part. The Co-operative Bank will not, as it is no longer considered systemically significant.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, said on Friday that the Fed planned to raise interest rates more slowly than in past recoveries because of the unusually fragile condition of the American economy.
Fed officials, who have held short-term interest rates near zero for more than six years, have indicated that they plan to start raising the Fed's key gauge later this year. Ms. Yellen's remarks, delivered at a conference in San Francisco, offered more details about the Fed's plans than earlier statements, all part of an effort to prepare markets for the end of that prolonged era.
And her message was that the return to normal conditions was likely to come slowly. There will be no repeat of the two-year period beginning in June 2004 when the Fed raised rates by 0.25 percentage points at every meeting.
"The average pace of tightening observed during previous recoveries could well provide a highly misleading guide to the actual course of monetary policy over the next few years," Ms. Yellen said.
Ms. Yellen's speech was delivered hours after the Commerce Department reported, in its final revision, that the United States economy grew at a rate of 2.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014, down from a robust 5 percent pace during the summer months. Economists said that the economy probably slowed even further in the first quarter of this year, which ends on Tuesday.
Despite the latest disappointing economic figures, Ms. Yellen emphasized that she saw the economy as improving, describing the current situation as a temporary slowdown during the winter months. She highlighted particular progress in labor markets, and said that she expected the economy to gain steam as consumer spending increased after a slow start to 2015.
But Ms. Yellen offered a more cautious policy outlook than some of her colleagues. "With continued improvement in economic conditions," she said, "an increase in the target range for that rate may well be warranted later this year."
By contrast, Dennis P. Lockhart, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, said earlier this week it was "quite likely" the Fed would raise rates no later than September. John C. Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, and Ms. Yellen's host on Friday, said "by midyear it will be the time to have a discussion."
Fed officials have said they would closely monitor the course of the economy in determining when to raise interest rates and by how much. Raising rates tends to slow growth and restrain inflation, while keeping rates low helps encourage additional business activity and job hiring.
Lately, even as the job market has displayed healthy signs of life -- the unemployment rate fell to 5.5 percent in February as employers hired 295,000 new workers -- other indicators have been anemic. If the economy advances more strongly than most Fed officials expect, suggesting that inflation will eventually gain momentum, the central bank is likely to raise rates more aggressively than if job gains and economic growth are disappointing.
This week, the government said durable goods orders fell last month and retail sales were also weak, despite benefits to consumers from low energy prices.
The nation's manufacturers have also been hurt by a stronger dollar and weak conditions in key markets like Europe and Brazil, which has curbed exports.
The downshift in early 2015 has echoes of the economy's performance in the first quarter of 2014, when cold temperatures and snow were blamed for a 2.1 percent contraction in output.
Next week, the economic picture may become a bit clearer. Data are due on Friday on job creation and unemployment in March. Figures for the trade balance, home sales, personal consumption and construction in February are set to come out earlier in the week.
In her speech in San Francisco, Ms. Yellen provided new insight into the Fed's decision-making process. She said the Fed would not wait for price inflation to increase before it moved to raise rates. She also played down the importance of wage inflation, an issue on which her views have evolved significantly.
In speeches last year, Ms. Yellen highlighted the slow pace of wage inflation as evidence of slack in the labor market. But on Friday she described it as unreliable, saying that wages might be stagnating for a variety of reasons including globalization and the decline of unions.
"The outlook for wages is highly uncertain even if price inflation does move back to 2 percent and labor market conditions continue to improve as projected," Ms. Yellen said. "This uncertainty limits the usefulness of wage trends as an indicator of the Fed's progress in achieving its inflation objective."
Ms. Yellen said that the Fed intended to focus on job growth, judging that if unemployment continued to fall, prices and wages would begin to rise.
David G. Blanchflower, an economist at Dartmouth College, described Ms. Yellen's conclusions as a "big mistake." Mr. Blanchflower argued in a paper last year that the pace of wage growth was the best measure of labor market health. He cautioned on Friday that other central banks, including the Swedish Riksbank, had to backtrack after raising rates too soon.
Ms. Yellen said the timing of the first increase, which many experts say is likely to take place in September, was less important than the pace of later ones, which would determine borrowing costs in coming years. And she gave three reasons the pace was likely to be quite slow.
First, despite the Fed's campaign to revive growth, the economy remains weak, implying that the central bank's help is still needed. "If underlying conditions had truly returned to normal, the economy should be booming," Ms. Yellen said.
Second, Ms. Yellen said, moving too quickly carries greater risks than tardiness. The Fed's tools for reviving growth are already in use; if the economy swoons, it is not clear how much more the Fed can do. And the Fed sees little risk in waiting: Ms. Yellen said she still saw little threat from any overheating in financial markets.
Finally, Ms. Yellen said, there could be important economic benefits in limiting interest rate increases until the labor market had not only healed but also tightened considerably. Such patience could help to increase inflation, which in recent years has remained well below the 2 percent annual pace that the Fed regards as most healthy.
Ms. Yellen said that moving slowly could also help undo some damage caused by the recession.
"The deep recession and slow recovery likely have held back investment in physical and human capital, restrained the rate of new business formation, prompted discouraged workers to leave the labor force and eroded the skills of the long-term unemployed," she said. "Some of these effects might be reversed in a tight labor market."

Abstract: Confronted with a steep drop in the value of the euro against the dollar, customers in Europe warn that they can no longer afford to buy Eastman's American-made cutting equipment without deep discounts.

Full text:   The dollar's sharp rise in recent months has left Robert Stevenson and Eastman Machine, his family's 127-year-old Buffalo company, feeling the heat on both sides of the Atlantic.
Confronted with a steep drop in the value of the euro against the dollar, customers in Europe warn that they can no longer afford to buy Eastman's American-made cutting equipment without deep discounts. Buyers in America, meanwhile, are demanding lower prices from Mr. Stevenson, too, as European-based rivals take advantage of the suddenly stronger dollar, which allows them to reduce prices on the machines they export to the United States without squeezing profits.
In both cases, Mr. Stevenson has been forced to compromise, cutting prices and sacrificing profit margins to avoid losing business. "We are hardly making money, but we need to keep these customers and keep our factory going," he said. "This wouldn't have happened a couple of years ago."
Indeed, the sharp rise of the dollar threatens to undercut one of the principal drivers of the recovery in recent years: strong export growth for American companies.
At the same time, it is also raising concerns among policy makers at the Federal Reserve. Last week, Janet L. Yellen, the Fed chairwoman, warned that the stronger dollar was likely to weigh on exports, producing "a notable drag this year on the outlook."
On Tuesday, McCormick & Company, the spice producer, said the robust dollar would hurt results in the months ahead; other well-known American companies like Tiffany and Oracle made similar pronouncements last week. More warnings are expected as companies begin to report earnings for the first quarter of 2015, which ends on Tuesday.
Although the euro has rebounded slightly in recent days, with one euro now worth just under $1.10, the shared currency used by 19 countries in Europe is down sharply from $1.25 in December. Other currencies from different parts of the world, including the British pound, the Australian dollar, the Japanese yen and the Brazilian real, have followed a similar trajectory.
Globally, the dollar's strength means American-made products -- unless their manufacturers adjust prices -- effectively cost about 15 to 20 percent more to foreign consumers than they did a year ago. Few economists expect the dollar to reverse course anytime soon; many expect the euro and the dollar to reach parity in the coming months for the first time since 2003.
Currency swings, though, can serve as a get-out-of-jail-free excuse for executives when their company's numbers fall short of Wall Street's expectations.
"Every company out there will blame the dollar in some way, shape or form, but there is a reason for that," said Scott Clemons, chief investment strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman. "Currencies are the hardest thing in the world to figure out because there are so many moving parts."
The exact causes vary from country to country, but in most cases the dollar is surging because the United States remains an island of relative strength in the global economy. Another important contributing factor is the expectation that the Fed will increase interest rates later this year, even as the European Central Bank is keeping them low in a bid to stimulate the long-dormant economy there.
That anticipated gap in future yields, along with a desire among global investors for a safe harbor as tumult continues in Russia and the Middle East, is drawing cash from overseas into dollar-denominated investments, pushing the value of the dollar higher.
There are economic benefits, as well as costs, from this shift. Imported goods are cheaper for American consumers, limiting the threat of inflation and potentially giving the Fed more time before a rate rise kicks in. Similarly, travel abroad is becoming more affordable for American tourists.
Still, for businesses that depend on sales overseas, and executives like Mr. Stevenson, the dollar's surge has meant both resignation and adaptation.
In Eastman Machine's case, it has meant cutting costs wherever possible, importing more of the components that go into the products that Eastman's 125 workers in Buffalo assemble instead of sourcing them domestically, and moving some production to the company's other factory, near Shanghai.
"We are shopping more overseas," Mr. Stevenson said. "We're a microcosm of what's happening at a lot of U.S. companies. It costs the U.S. jobs, but we'd be foolish not to."
For example, Mr. Stevenson is planning to buy a new control system for his factory that is made in Germany rather than the United States. With a price of several hundred thousand dollars, the currency savings are substantial.
And while the machines Eastman sells in the United States and Europe will continue to be made in Buffalo, Mr. Stevenson said, he is shifting production aimed at the fast-growing Indian market to China to gain an edge in pricing.
"I'm not losing so much business," he said, "but it is hurting American jobs and profit margins." Were it not for the price pressure from European customers and the need to produce more of his products in China to sell to India, he figured, Eastman would employ 10 to 20 more workers in Buffalo than it currently does.
"This has nothing to do with the wage scale," Mr. Stevenson added. "We're very competitive in terms of productivity. But the Indian market is taking off and we are being forced to manufacture outside of the U.S. to stay competitive there."
Although the weaker euro tends to dominate the headlines when it comes to the dollar's rise, the decline of other currencies poses similar risks for many American companies.
Briggs & Stratton, a publicly traded Milwaukee firm whose products include gasoline engines for outdoor power equipment, as well as Snapper lawn mowers and Simplicity tractors, has raised prices a bit in Australia and Brazil as the dollar has climbed, but it fears losing market share as a result, as do other manufacturers.
"We have implemented price increases, but it comes down to competition," said Todd J. Teske, the company's chief executive. "At what point does demand suffer because of price? I'm concerned that these currencies will continue to weaken against the dollar."
Only about 30 percent of Briggs & Stratton's sales come from overseas. So for now, the American market is still where the action is.
For much bigger American companies that look abroad for a majority of sales, like Boeing and United Technologies, the threat of a surging dollar might seem greater, but their size and global footprint actually make adaptation somewhat easier.
In Boeing's case, executives said, the huge lead time between orders and delivery in the aviation industry reduces the impact currency swings have on sales. The aircraft market is also priced in dollars for customers globally, further limiting the effect of currency moves.
United Technologies, which makes everything from Carrier air-conditioners to Otis elevators, tends to locate production close to customers wherever possible. So elevators for the Chinese market are built there while workers in Europe are paid in euros to make air-conditioners that are sold in euros, insulating the company from some of the impact.
Still, sales and profits overseas are converted into dollars to calculate financial results each quarter, so United Technologies has been forced to bring down its estimates for 2015 revenue and earnings.
With more volatility expected in the currency markets in the months ahead, many executives admit they have little control over such global economic shifts.
"It's not that easy in the short term to move production one way or another, even though we have factories all over the world," said John Selldorff, who runs the North American operations of Legrand, a global manufacturer of electrical and data products based in France.
Some companies employ complex hedging strategies using futures and other financial instruments. But that has costs of its own, Mr. Selldorff cautions, adding that he would rather make bets on what he knows -- electrical equipment -- than on the dollar's next move.
"In the dozen-plus years I've worked here, this stuff ebbs and flows," he said. "These are trends that you just have to work around."

Full text:   A seesaw day for United States stocks ended with slight losses on Thursday, giving the market its fourth consecutive decline.
Investors continue to monitor violence in the Middle East and the rapid ascent of the dollar, which is causing companies to reduce their profit forecasts for the year.
After hitting nominal highs -- not adjusted for inflation -- this month, stocks have been steadily declining this week. Strategists and traders said the strong dollar, geopolitical tensions and a market that is already expensive have given investors little incentive to buy in recent days.
"We have been due for a pullback," said Brad Sorensen of the Schwab Center for Financial Research. Referring to the possibility that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates this summer, he added, "The markets have been focused on the Fed and the impact of a stronger dollar."
The Dow Jones industrial average lost 40.31 points, or 0.2 percent, to close at 17,678.23. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 4.90 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,056.15, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 13.16 points, or 0.3 percent, to 4,863.36.
The market has fallen every day this week, bringing the S.&P. 500 index and the Dow down 2.5 percent each and erasing their gains for the year. The Nasdaq has dropped even more this week, 3.2 percent, as traders sold highflying biotech companies heavily. The Nasdaq is still up 2.7 percent for the year.
Most of the action on Thursday was in the energy markets. The price of oil rose sharply as traders worried that mounting tensions in Yemen could disrupt the flow of crude from the Persian Gulf region. Saudi Arabia and other gulf states struck military installations in Yemen in an effort to oust Shiite rebels who had forced the country's president to flee.
United States crude rose $2.22, or 4.5 percent, to settle at $51.43 a barrel in New York. United States crude oil has risen 17 percent since hitting a low of $43.96 a barrel a week ago.
Brent crude, a benchmark for international oils used by many American refineries, rose $2.71, or 4.8 percent, to close at $59.19 a barrel in London.
"The conflict has the potential to act as a drag on oil supplies as most oil tankers from Arab producers must pass by the Yemen coastline in order to get through the Red Sea and Suez Canal," said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda.
The rise in oil was not enough to lift battered energy stocks. The energy sector in the S.&P. 500 index ended the day down 0.2 percent.
For most investors, the main focus remains the United States dollar. The dollar has appreciated 8 percent in the last three months. A stronger dollar tends to make goods produced in the United States more expensive abroad, making it more difficult for American companies to compete.
"The dollar is going to be a drag on company earnings, at least temporarily," said Stephen Freedman, a strategist at UBS Wealth Management Americas.
On Thursday, the euro fell to $1.0883 against the dollar, while the dollar declined to 119.2 Japanese yen.
The full impact of the dollar's appreciation will probably be seen early next month, when United States companies start reporting quarterly results. Some, like the jewelry maker Tiffany, have already said the higher dollar has crimped profits.
Alcoa, the aluminum company, will report its results on April 8.
In the bond market, prices for United States government bonds fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.99 percent from 1.93 percent late Wednesday. The price fell 19/32, to 100 2/32.

Full text:   PARIS -- A measure of business sentiment in the eurozone has hit its highest level in nearly four years, providing one more glimmer of hope that a long-awaited European economic recovery might finally be taking hold.
Markit Economics, a data analysis firm based in London, said on Tuesday that its March survey of purchasing managers across the 19-nation eurozone showed output expanding at the quickest pace since May 2011.
There are still plenty of caveats to signs of recovery, including high unemployment in much of Europe. And data from Britain on Tuesday showed inflation at a new, worrisomely low level.
But Tuesday's data on business sentiment comes on the heels of the highest eurozone consumer confidence reading, released on Monday, since before the 2008 financial crisis. And last week, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development raised its 2015 and 2016 growth forecasts for the region.
>
The purchasing managers' data provides one of the most closely watched real-time guides to the eurozone's economic health.
"It's further evidence of a cyclical upturn in the eurozone," said Janet Henry, chief European economist at HSBC in London. She pointed to a number of positive signs, including recent acceleration in retail spending.
The Markit Economics composite index of business activity rose to 54.1 from 53.3 in February. An index reading greater than 50 suggests economic expansion, while a number below that level suggests contraction.
Doing their part to aid the economy are a weaker euro against the dollar, low oil prices and the recent bond-buying program begun by the European Central Bank.
"The improvement provides welcome news to a region awaiting signs that the E.C.B.'s quantitative easing is stimulating the real economy," Chris Williamson, Markit's chief economist, said in a statement, referring to the central bank's plan to buy 60 billion euros, or about $65 billion, in bonds each month through at least September 2016.
In addition to signaling relatively strong German growth, Mr. Williamson said the Markit data provided "signs of a long-awaited recovery in France," which he said appeared to be expanding at the fastest rate since 2011.
The euro, which has been getting back some of the ground it lost since late last year, ticked up 0.3 percent, to $1.0977, after the report. The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone blue chip shares ended up 0.87 percent for the day.
On Monday, the European Central Bank's president, Mario Draghi, told European lawmakers in Brussels that "the basis for the economic recovery in the euro area has clearly strengthened."
Mr. Draghi cited the fall in oil prices, a pickup in external demand, a weaker euro and the central bank's "accommodative monetary policy," which has driven down borrowing costs, as the main reasons for optimism. The central bank expects the eurozone's gross domestic product to grow 1.5 percent this year, accelerating to 1.9 percent next year and to 2.1 percent in 2017.
Some economists were quick to raise warning flags. Hopes have been repeatedly raised since the 2008 global financial crisis that the eurozone was finally set to break into a sustained recovery, only for them to be dashed. The eurozone's economic output remains below its precrisis levels, even though the United States and Britain have regained and surpassed theirs.
"There's a need for caution: We've been here before," said Carsten Brzeski, chief economist at ING-DiBa in Frankfurt. But he said he saw distinctions, too. "What is different this time around is the external environment -- the euro is weaker and oil prices are far lower," he said. "It's a stimulus package for free."
In the view of Ms. Henry, the HSBC economist, the current momentum is notable mainly because it appears to be led by consumers, spurred by lower oil prices.
"The levels aren't spectacular," she said, noting that current growth would not be enough either to keep deflationary pressures at bay or to push down the jobless rate in the bloc from the 11.2 percent at which it stood in January. To ramp up growth, she added, Europe needs more investment and external demand.
Mr. Brzeski said that another difference in the latest glimmers of a rebound was the commitment of the European Central Bank. That contrasts with the picture in spring 2011, the last time the purchasing managers' index showed the same level of growth.
Back then, the central bank, under its former president Jean-Claude Trichet, began raising interest rates, on the assumption that the postcrisis recovery was firmly established. That proved to be a major miscalculation, especially as the eurozone's sovereign debt crisis, which peaked in 2012, was still sapping business and consumer confidence.
The European Central Bank began its bond-buying program this month, partly out of concern that inflation was too low in the eurozone. Even without tipping into the condition known as outright deflation, in which the general level of prices is declining, a too-low inflation rate may weigh on growth and stress borrowers and lenders. The central bank seeks to keep prices rising at a rate just below 2 percent, but prices have been declining for three straight months, most recently by 0.3 percent in February from a year earlier.
The problem of declining consumer prices is being felt not just in the eurozone, but in the United States and around the world. On Tuesday, the British Office for National Statistics reported that its Consumer Price Index showed zero inflation in February, the lowest level on record for that measure.
Mr. Brzeski said that the risks on the horizon -- including the debt problems of Greece, the military crisis in Ukraine and the Federal Reserve's desire to begin "normalizing" interest rates this year -- made it too early to say Europe had reached a turning point.
"The ground is prepared for at least a cyclical recovery," Mr. Brzeski said. "But it's far too early to say if it's going to be enough."

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- A modest rebound in gas costs and broad gains in other categories lifted consumer prices in the United States for the first time in four months, a sign inflation may be stabilizing.
The Consumer Price Index rose 0.2 percent in February, the Labor Department said Tuesday. It dropped 0.7 percent in January, the biggest decline in six years.
Also Tuesday, the Commerce Department said that sales of new homes in February climbed to their fastest pace in seven years, as an otherwise dormant American housing market showed fresh signs of life.
Gas prices have plummeted since June, drastically lowering inflation. They fell for seven straight months before rising 2.4 percent in February, the government said. Prices at the pump are still nearly 33 percent lower than a year ago.
Largely as a result, consumer prices were unchanged in the 12 months that ended in February, after slipping 0.1 percent in January from a year earlier. Yet excluding gas, prices have been more stable.
Outside food and energy, core prices also rose 0.2 percent last month. The cost of rents, clothes, new and used cars, and airfares all increased. Core prices have risen 1.7 percent in the past year.
Even with February's uptick in prices, economists expect the strong dollar will keep inflation in check in the coming months because it makes imported goods cheaper. The dollar has risen sharply in value in the past year compared with the euro and yen, as the American economy is growing more quickly than those in Europe and Japan.
As gas prices stabilize, the year-over-year inflation rate should eventually start to rise, probably by midyear, economists say. Paul Ashworth, chief economist at Capital Economics, said he expected that core inflation would not reach the Fed's 2 percent target until the first half of next year.
"It is too early to say inflation is turning higher," said Jennifer Lee, an economist at BMO Capital Markets. The dollar's strength "takes time to filter through to prices and the recent increase will show up in coming months."
The Consumer Price Index is far below the 2 percent target set by the Federal Reserve, complicating the Fed's decision on when to raise the short-term interest rate it controls.
In February, new-home sales shot up 7.8 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 539,000, the strongest performance since February 2008. January sales were revised up nearly 4 percent to a rate of 500,000.
Other parts of the housing market have struggled since 2015 got off to a frigid start, despite historically low mortgage rates and a sharp, yearlong upswing in hiring. The shift in purchases of newly built homes may suggest that the job growth is spilling over to other parts of the economy.
"The housing market remains in recovery mode and that activity for the rest of the year is likely to improve at a modest, albeit choppy, pace," said Blerina Uruçi, an analyst at the bank Barclays.
The strong increase came from the South and, surprisingly, the Northeast, which was hammered by snowstorms last month. Buying fell in the Midwest and West last month. The median sales price rose 2.6 percent since February 2014 to $275,500.

Full text:   A late turn pulled the stock market to a loss on Monday, as major indexes wavered after a strong run last week.
The railroad Kansas City Southern slumped 8 percent, the largest fall in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, after it trimmed its revenue estimates, citing declining fuel prices and the strengthening dollar. Its stock lost $9.21 to close at $106.48.
Major indexes started higher in morning trading, settled into an afternoon lull, then dipped in the last 10 minutes of trading.
The S.&P. 500 declined 3.68 points, or 0.2 percent, to close at 2,104.42. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 11.61 points, or 0.1 percent, to 18,116.04, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 15.44 points, or 0.3 percent, to 5,010.97.
Traders watched a meeting in Europe between the leaders of Greece and Germany for signs of progress in Greece's debt negotiations. Greece, facing a cash squeeze within weeks, is talking with its European lenders about what it must do to receive more loans.
Alexis Tsipras, the Greek prime minister, committed to keeping a dialogue open on changes that would qualify Greece for rescue loans.
Brad McMillan, chief investment officer at Commonwealth Financial Network, said he expected the market to rise in the coming months because nothing on the horizon appears capable of knocking it off course. Investors have pushed the S.&P. 500 to new highs despite concerns over Europe's sluggish economy and slumping oil prices.
"Greece hasn't pulled it down; deflation hasn't pulled it down," Mr. McMillan said. "Unless the Federal Reserve says it's going to raise interest rates in June, I just can't see what's going to pull it down."
Last week, the S.&P. 500 jumped nearly 3 percent, its largest weekly gain since early February. Investors cheered Wednesday when the Federal Reserve said that it was in no hurry to raise interest rates with inflation low.
Among other companies making moves, the pharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences dropped after reports that it had told physicians that nine patients taking its hepatitis C treatments developed slow heartbeats and that one died. Gilead slid $2.03, or nearly 2 percent, to $100.26.
Tenet Healthcare surged 5 percent after news that it planned a hospital venture with a private equity firm. Tenet's stock gained $2.45, or nearly 5 percent, to $52.07.
Major markets in Europe ended mixed. Germany's DAX lost 1.2 percent and France's CAC 40 shed 0.7 percent. Britain's FTSE 100 picked up 0.2 percent.
Tokyo's Nikkei 225 finished with a gain of 1 percent. In China, the Shanghai composite index surged 2 percent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng added 0.5 percent.
In the United States, bond prices inched up, sending yields down. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note slipped to 1.91 percent from 1.93 percent late Friday.
In commodity trading, prices for precious and industrial metals increased. Gold rose $3.10 to settle at $1,187.70 an ounce, while silver picked up a penny to $16.89 an ounce. Copper added 3 cents to $2.79.
The price of oil edged up in the face of signs that the growth in the domestic supply may be slowing. Benchmark United States crude rose 88 cents to close at $47.45 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, a benchmark for international oils used by many American refineries, added 60 cents to close at $55.92 in London.
In other futures trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, wholesale gasoline rose 0.6 cent to close at $1.804 a gallon; heating oil fell 0.3 cent to close at $1.731 a gallon; and natural gas fell 5.3 cents to close at $2.733 per 1,000 cubic feet.

Full text:   The 2016 election is still 19 mind-numbing, soul-killing months away. There is, however, another important election in just six weeks, as Britain goes to the polls. And many of the same issues are on the table.
Unfortunately, economic discourse in Britain is dominated by a misleading fixation on budget deficits. Worse, this bogus narrative has infected supposedly objective reporting; media organizations routinely present as fact propositions that are contentious if not just plain wrong.
Needless to say, Britain isn't the only place where things like this happen. A few years ago, at the height of our own deficit fetishism, the American news media showed some of the same vices. Allegedly factual articles would declare that debt fears were driving up interest rates with zero evidence to support such claims. Reporters would drop all pretense of neutrality and cheer on proposals for entitlement cuts.
In the United States, however, we seem to have gotten past that. Britain hasn't.
The narrative I'm talking about goes like this: In the years before the financial crisis, the British government borrowed irresponsibly, so that the country was living far beyond its means. As a result, by 2010 Britain was at imminent risk of a Greek-style crisis; austerity policies, slashing spending in particular, were essential. And this turn to austerity is vindicated by Britain's low borrowing costs, coupled with the fact that the economy, after several rough years, is now growing quite quickly.
Simon Wren-Lewis of Oxford University has dubbed this narrative "mediamacro." As his coinage suggests, this is what you hear all the time on TV and read in British newspapers, presented not as the view of one side of the political debate but as simple fact.
Yet none of it is true.
Was the Labour government that ruled Britain before the crisis profligate? Nobody thought so at the time. In 2007, government debt as a percentage of G.D.P. was close to its lowest level in a century (and well below the level in the United States), while the budget deficit was quite small. The only way to make those numbers look bad is to claim that the British economy in 2007 was operating far above capacity, inflating tax receipts. But if that had been true, Britain should have been experiencing high inflation, which it wasn't.
Still, wasn't Britain at risk of a Greek-style crisis, in which investors could lose confidence in its bonds and send interest rates soaring? There's no reason to think so. Unlike Greece, Britain has retained its own currency and borrows in that currency -- and no country fitting this description has experienced that kind of crisis. Consider the case of Japan, which has far bigger debt and deficits than Britain ever did yet can currently borrow long-term at an interest rate of just 0.32 percent.
Which brings me to claims that austerity has been vindicated. Yes, British interest rates have stayed low. So have almost everyone else's. For example, French borrowing costs are at their lowest level in history. Even debt-crisis countries like Italy and Spain can borrow at lower rates than Britain pays.
What about growth? When the current British government came to power in 2010, it imposed harsh austerity -- and the British economy, which had been recovering from the 2008 slump, soon began slumping again. In response, Prime Minister David Cameron's government backed off, putting plans for further austerity on hold (but without admitting that it was doing any such thing). And growth resumed.
If this counts as a policy success, why not try repeatedly hitting yourself in the face for a few minutes? After all, it will feel great when you stop.
Given all this, you might wonder how mediamacro gained such a hold on British discourse. Don't blame economists. As Mr. Wren-Lewis points out, very few British academics (as opposed to economists employed by the financial industry) accept the proposition that austerity has been vindicated. This media orthodoxy has become entrenched despite, not because of, what serious economists had to say.
Still, you can say the same of Bowles-Simpsonism in the United States, and we know how that doctrine temporarily came to hold so much sway. It was all about posturing, about influential people believing that pontificating about the need to make sacrifices -- or, actually, for other people to make sacrifices -- is how you sound wise and serious. Hence the preference for a narrative prioritizing tough talk about deficits, not hard thinking about job creation.
As I said, in the United States we have mainly gotten past that, for a variety of reasons -- among them, I suspect, the rise of analytical journalism, in places like The Times's The Upshot. But Britain hasn't; an election that should be about real problems will, all too likely, be dominated by mediamacro fantasies.

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDED. Once a week, after touring the Caribbean, the cruise ship Oasis of the Seas calls into its home port in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., for what is called "turnaround day."
Just as an airplane makes money only when it is flying, keeping a cruise ship out at sea is essential for its profitability. But instead of turning over a few hundred airline passengers, this ship offloads 6,000 people, takes on new supplies and welcomes 6,000 more travelers -- all in under 12 hours.
Logistics are essential on turnaround day, at once the first and last day of a cruise, and the busiest time for the ship's 2,140 crew members. Oasis docks at about 6 a.m. and leaves by 4:30 p.m. In that time, more than 12,000 bags need to get off the ship, food must be stocked, beds made and bathrooms cleaned. Getting everything ready in time is part Nascar pit stop, part loading of Noah's Ark.
"Embarkation day is frantic," said Rodolfo Corrales, the ship's provision master, whose job is to keep the vessel fully stocked for its journey. "It's not just busy, it's crazy busy."
Born in the 1970s, the modern cruise industry now counts more than 400 ships offering cruises tailored to many budgets and whims -- from luxury ships sailing the Mediterranean Sea to mass-market holidays in the Caribbean Sea, still the most popular voyage for cruisers. Last year, more than 17 million passengers took a North American cruise, up from seven million in 2000, according to the Cruise Lines International Association.
The trade group expects the industry to grow again this year after a lukewarm performance in the last two years. Bookings fell after the grounding of Carnival's Costa Concordia in 2012, a tragedy that killed 32 people. That was followed the next year by the Carnival Triumph's loss of power at sea.
The Triumph had capacity for about 3,000 passengers and 1,100 crew members, making it an average-size cruise ship. The Oasis can accommodate twice as many passengers. To put that into perspective, think back to the Carnival Holiday. In 1985 it was one of the biggest ships of the day; it could fit 1,400 passengers.
The Oasis, which is owned by Royal Caribbean, caters to middle-class vacationers -- there is a casino, an aqua-theater for highflying diving acts, and a Broadway-style production of "Cats" -- and on a recent turnaround day during the winter high season, it was packed with families, retirees and young couples looking for a break from the cold.
Before heading for a seven-day cruise to the Bahamas, the Oasis needs to stock everything a small city might need. This includes 24,000 bottles of beer and 1,400 bottles of Champagne. It rarely picks up any provisions during the cruise, only topping up its fuel tanks while visiting ports.
Bread is baked onboard, and 2,000 tons of fresh water a day are produced through a reverse-osmosis desalination system. A treatment system handles all the wastewater generated by the passengers and crew. That system, which processes 1,200 tons of wastewater a day, uses bacteria to break down waste, then mechanical and chemical systems to remove solids, and finally ultraviolet light to disinfect. The water at the end is clean enough to drink but is discarded in the sea. Any remaining solids are held in special tanks to dry and be incinerated.
Almost all trash is recycled aboard or repurposed. Bottles, cans and compost are crushed and frozen in cold-temperature rooms to prevent the spread of bacteria. Engine heat is used to heat laundry room water and showers; air-conditioning condensation is also used as a source for laundry water.
Standing near one of the cargo doors on the dock, Lincoln Brooks, the ship's inventory manager, keeps an eye on the clock. Around him is a jumble of trucks, forklifts and carts all moving at a steady clip. Every step is timed to avoid bottlenecks inside the narrow galleys as two dozen cold-storage rooms slowly fill up with fresh vegetables, including 15,000 pounds of potatoes, 9,000 pounds of tomatoes and about 9,000 soda cans.
"I need to keep things moving," he said. "I can't afford for the captain to call me." Rain can make work more hazardous and slow things down, but this was a crisp morning and Mr. Brooks seemed relaxed.
The countdown before sailing started deep inside the ship as well. A small legion of workers hustled along the main artery, a service corridor known as I-95 that runs nearly the length of the ship and allows fast access to any section.
Royal Caribbean has built the largest cruise ship terminal at Port Everglades, in Florida, to handle the flow of passengers from Oasis and its twin, the Allure. To prevent long immigration control lines from forming, departures are staggered over a few hours.
Passengers begin to leave their cabins about 7 a.m. and must be off the ship by 10:30 a.m. The main bottleneck is juggling the flow of bags. Passengers are handed color-coded tags for their luggage, which is collected the night before the ship reaches the port.
About 15 to 30 minutes after the last passenger leaves, newcomers start trickling in through one of two gangways linked to the terminal ashore.
Oasis gets generally positive ratings on consumer websites. Passengers tend to praise the embarkation process, though they give lower marks to port visits and shore excursions. The ship recently received four out of five stars on CruiseCritics.com for the whole trip; the embarkation process was rated five out of five by most reviewers.
Packing in passengers has been a winning formula for the business. (Until Oasis went into dry dock for a two-week maintenance last year, it had been in service for more than 1,800 days, or five straight years.)
Royal Caribbean, which has the world's three largest cruise ships, doubled its revenue in the last decade to $8 billion last year. To increase its profit per passenger, the company is also moving away from traditional all-inclusive formulas to offering services and amenities for an extra cost. About a third of its revenue now comes from selling items during port visits or sales onboard -- Wi-Fi access, for example. Passengers can pay up to $400 to connect two devices for seven days to download movies or make Skype calls from the middle of the ocean.
A few years ago, Royal Caribbean brought in experts in industrial productivity, including DHL and the German carmaker Porsche, to help manage complex flows on the ship. As an example, the efficiency experts helped determine where to locate waiter stations in the main dining room to reduce the number of footsteps needed to serve hundreds of diners simultaneously.
They also figured out a way to clean rooms faster by borrowing from techniques used in auto manufacturing. The company conducted time and motion studies on their workers to identify where they could be more efficient.
During the cruise, attendants are responsible for 15 to 17 rooms each. On turnaround day, they have a precise list of tasks to perform. They first take out the dirty linen and towels and line them up in the hallways in green and red bags. The efficiency specialists decided that bedsheets and towels should be separated before they are sent to the laundry room. Rooms are then dusted and wiped.
Attendants work alone, except when they fit new sheets to the beds, when they pair up. That task should take three to five minutes at most, said Edna Pli, the head housekeeper. Thanks to this precise flow, 189 housekeepers can get more than 2,700 rooms ready by noon.
"We have everything down to a fine art," said Martin Rissley, the ship's hotel director. "The minute efficiencies you can create in the process make a big difference in the end."
Down in the lowest decks, the laundry room quickly filled up with dirty linen, with bags lining hallways and piling up in corners. By the end of the day, the crew washed 93,000 pounds of laundry. Bedsheets are folded automatically in presses. But 29,000 towels are folded by hand.
Crew members, who come from all over the world (many are from the Philippines), work long shifts. Some will stay onboard for four months at a time and work seven days a week, taking short breaks during the day, then head home for a two-month rest period. It can be grueling and repetitive work. Eight butchers, for instance, spend the cruise chopping up 25,000 pounds of meat each week, working in two shifts of four.
This obsession with detail and planning has become necessary as cruise ships get ever bigger. But risks also come with size. An engine fire on the Carnival Triumph two years ago crippled the ship at sea for several days. Toilets clogged, food perished, and passengers slept on decks to avoid the stench in their cabins.
Carnival has since fitted its ships with emergency generators to avoid another similar mishap. But the ship's plight turned off many would-be cruisers, and bookings dropped industrywide. Cameras aboard helicopters showed images of makeshift tents on the pool deck, and passengers described their ordeal in apocalyptic terms.
"It's like being locked in a Porta-Potty for days," one passenger, Peter Cass, a physician from Beaumont, Tex., said at the time. "We've lived through two hurricanes, and this is worse."
The hazards were also apparent in January 2012 when the Costa Concordia, also owned by Carnival, ran aground off the coast of Italy after its captain steered it off course, and then delayed evacuating the ship when it hit rocks by the island of Giglio. Thirty-two people died. The captain, Francesco Schettino, was convicted of manslaughter and abandoning the ship with passengers onboard.
"These accidents were definitely a wake-up call for the industry," said Henry Harteveldt, founder of the Atmosphere Research Group, a travel industry research firm. "Cruise companies learned the hard way, and many of the newer ships now have redundancies built in them."
A norovirus outbreak is one of would-be cruisers' biggest fears. Royal Caribbean said the virus was usually brought on board by passengers who were already sick. For that reason, there are hand-sanitizing stations throughout the ship, and passengers are constantly reminded to wash their hands thoroughly. Attendants offer passengers sanitizing gel as they board, too.
If there is an outbreak, cruise companies typically follow similar containment protocols, which include trying to quarantine sick people in their rooms and sanitizing public areas to prevent the disease from spreading. Once they return to port, ships must be thoroughly disinfected.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention counted at least eight instances of norovirus contaminations infecting more than 3 percent of passengers for ships arriving in United States ports last year. There have been two cases so far this year. The latest was in February, when 142 passengers and eight crew members got sick during a 10-day Caribbean cruise on the Celebrity Equinox, with symptoms of diarrhea and vomiting. There were a total of 2,896 passengers and 1,209 crew members on board.
Harri Kulovaara, Royal Caribbean's chief naval architect, acknowledges that larger ships have challenges. Royal Caribbean had to come up with new lifeboats that could fit as many as 370 passengers, instead of 180, because adding enough smaller vessels would have taken too much hull space.
But Mr. Kulovaara, who is considered one of the industry's most innovative architects, said bigger ships also provided safety features. Thanks to its width, Oasis remains stable while cruising, even in bad weather. The ship is powered by six huge engines -- each about the size of a school bus -- that can produce extra power when encountering strong crosswinds as it enters a port, for instance.
Most important, its engines are housed in two separate rooms and can be operated independently if needed. This redundancy, common in new Royal Caribbean ships for over a decade, became the norm for new cruise ships after the Triumph episode.
"We never set out to build the biggest ships in the world," Mr. Kulovaara said. "Size creates certain challenges, of course. But the driver is really what is giving us a unique design and a unique vacation for our guests."
One of Oasis's most distinctive features is an open-air atrium that runs down the middle of the ship. It allows sunlight to come inside the vessel, enabling some inside cabins to have balconies. Those cabins can be sold at a premium. Prices for a seven-night cruise in March vary from $1,109 a person for an interior room (without windows) to $2,999 a person for a suite.
Mr. Kulovaara came up with the design in the late 1980s when he was working on a Scandinavian ferry, the Silja Serenade. The Oasis and the Allure have proved so popular that Royal Caribbean has ordered two more of them, at a cost of about $1.5 billion each.
Soon, the Oasis will depart. Weather is the main cause of delays and can have ripple effects on future cruises. For instance, when fog recently delayed a ship from docking in Tampa, Fla., for more than a day, Royal Caribbean mobilized a "war room" of staff members onshore to rebook flights for delayed passengers and find accommodations for more than 3,000 people who were waiting for their ship to show up.
The last passengers trickle in and visitors leave, including the piano tuner who boards every two weeks to work on the ship's five grand pianos. At 4:30 p.m., the odyssey begins again.
Correction: March 29, 2015, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Sunday about the logistics of unloading and loading an ocean liner between cruises misstated the trend in profit per passenger for Royal Caribbean. Adjusted for inflation, profit has decreased over the last 10 years, from an inflation-adjusted $164.85 in 2005 to $148 last year. It has not increased.

Full text:   Some economic forecasters have pinned their hopes for an improvement in the economy on this year's early Easter to boost consumer spending after a brutal winter.
That outlook has a dispiritingly familiar ring to it. In recent years, bad weather has often been blamed for weaker than expected economic performance while the prospect of Easter shopping and warmer weather has been seen as a sure catalyst for growth.
To some extent, the economy does move up and down with the seasons. But time and again in the current recovery, seasonal upswings have not heralded sustainable improvements. The economy faces tougher problems than the weather, and there are no easy or automatic fixes.
For instance, the economy was supposed to take off as unemployment fell. But unemployment is way down from its recession-era high, and there has been no big upsurge. Similarly, exports were supposed to help lead an economic revival. But the expected growth in exports has not occurred of late.
To its credit, the Federal Reserve is facing those issues. In its latest statements and projections, issued last week, it did not flinch from marking down its earlier projections for economic growth and price inflation through 2017 -- signaling that the economy is weaker than was thought to be the case only a few months ago. The markdowns also reflect underlying weaknesses in the economy that will not be corrected without fundamental changes.
Accordingly, the Fed embraced a fundamental change last week when it acknowledged that unemployment can fall further than previously believed without causing inflation. That acknowledgment will allow the Fed to keep stimulating the economy, and encourage job growth, with loose monetary policy for the foreseeable future.
What the Fed cannot directly affect is how much employers pay their workers. Stagnant and low pay is a decades-long phenomenon, but in the past its negative economic effects were masked partly by the growing participation of women in the work force and by easy credit for cash-strapped households. The former has run its course, and the latter has justifiably been curtailed.
Moreover, in the current recovery, rising economic growth and rising job growth have so far failed to push up pay appreciably. Without higher wages, the needs and wants of everyday life, let alone the luxuries, remain out of reach for many families, and as a result the economy remains in low gear. Changing that dynamic will require policy changes beyond the Fed's purview, including a higher minimum wage, updated rules for overtime pay, stronger support for collective bargaining, better enforcement of wage and hour laws and tougher trade pacts.
Congress has thus far not moved in any of those areas, though many lawmakers appear prepared to demand provisions in upcoming trade deals that would prevent currency manipulation that disadvantages American businesses and workers. States have a mixed record, with several of them raising their minimum wages, but others working to weaken collective bargaining.
Janet Yellen, the Fed chairwoman, has made it clear that she wants to see wage growth before she declares the labor market healthy. But where is that wage growth going to come from?

Abstract: Noting that Mr. Fisher was the rare non-economist among senior Fed officials, Mr. Volcker continued: "In an era in which economists claim a natural right to central banking leadership, Dick has brought a healthy sense of reality, sound judgment, business background and leadership."

Full text:   DALLAS -- In a decade as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, Richard W. Fisher was frequently mistaken in his economic predictions but seldom boring.
The departure of Mr. Fisher, who stepped down on Thursday, means that the Fed is losing one of the most outspoken internal opponents of its stimulus campaign just as it is winding down. Mr. Fisher argued right up to his retirement that the central bank was increasing economic inequality, destabilizing financial markets and might yet unleash higher inflation. But he is best known not so much for what he said as for the way he said it.
He spoke more often and more colorfully than any of his colleagues at the Federal Reserve, larding his speeches with quotes, anecdotes and metaphors. Among the most memorable was his 2012 description of his breeding bull, Too Big to Fail, as full of liquidity but unable to reach the pretty cows on the other side of the fence.
"His speeches have regularly been the most eloquent -- a true joy to read his somewhat excessive Texas exuberance in explaining both the successes and the possible excesses of monetary policy," the former Fed chairman Paul A. Volcker, a mentor to Mr. Fisher, said in a recent introduction.
Noting that Mr. Fisher was the rare non-economist among senior Fed officials, Mr. Volcker continued: "In an era in which economists claim a natural right to central banking leadership, Dick has brought a healthy sense of reality, sound judgment, business background and leadership."
But Mr. Fisher also has angered those who think the Fed can and should do more to help unemployed workers.
"He was wrong at the beginning, and he's still wrong now," said Danny Cendejas of the Texas Organizing Project, a nonprofit group that advocates for lower-income Texans. "He's ignoring the reality of what's happening, particularly in the Latino community and in communities of color."
At the Fed, Mr. Fisher was set apart by his views and his style. He kept a list of roughly 50 executives at corporations ranging from Walmart to American Airlines to "the Bud distributor in North Texas," and he called several dozen before each Fed meeting. He insisted that those anecdotal reports offered a more accurate and timely window onto the economy than government data and the Fed's elaborate models.
"My local dry cleaner, I would say that if you took him and put him against the whole Fed staff in terms of forecasting, he's been far more accurate," Mr. Fisher said.
Mr. Fisher now worries that the Fed is waiting too long to raise rates and that its efforts to assist the recovery instead will cause another downturn. He said the consequences of the Fed's stimulus campaign would not be clear for some time.
"How long?" he said, repeating a question. "No idea. And I hope my concerns, which are only expressed as uncertainties, prove to be sleep lost and nothing more."
These warnings have made Mr. Fisher a popular figure among the Fed's Republican critics, who also insist that the Fed's attempts to expand employment are doing more harm than good. So did a February speech in which Mr. Fisher told a New York audience that the Fed should change its governance structure to limit the outsize role of the New York Fed.
But Mr. Fisher has spoken sharply against calls from Republican lawmakers for new restrictions on the Fed's authority. He said he wanted the Fed itself to make better decisions.
Mr. Fisher rose in Horatio Alger style from childhood poverty to marry the daughter of a prominent congressman and build a fortune of more than $20 million as an investor. He worked his way through Harvard as a cook and a crew member on the yacht of a wealthy alumnus, and by renting his dorm room to amorous couples. Now he sits on Harvard's Board of Overseers.
He was born in Los Angeles in 1949 to a Norwegian mother and an Australian father who met in South Africa and conceived Mr. Fisher in Shanghai before moving to California. A few years later, propelled by poverty, the family moved to Mexico City, where Mr. Fisher learned to speak Spanish fluently.
After returning to California, he won a scholarship to attend Admiral Farragut Academy, a preparatory school for the United States Naval Academy. After two years at Annapolis, a teacher encouraged him to transfer to Harvard.
He ended up in Dallas after marrying the daughter of a Texas congressman, James Collins. The young couple lived in New York at first, where Mr. Fisher worked as an assistant to the banker Robert Roosa. But Mr. Fisher says that one day, while on a ferry returning from the Statue of Liberty with his infant son, he looked across the water at the New York skyline and decided to leave.
"I thought, 'This place is already made,"' he recalled. "Things were moving my way, but I just thought, 'This has already been built. I need to go someplace new."'
He made a fortune investing in distressed assets during the rocky years of the Texas economy in the late 1980s and early 1990s. After two failed runs for the United States Senate, he signed on with the Clinton administration as a deputy trade representative in 1997. He remained in Washington until 2005, when he got a call asking him if he'd like to come back to Texas to run the Dallas Fed.
The Fed's 12 regional branches together oversee the banking system, operate payments infrastructure and conduct economic research. Their presidents also participate in setting monetary policy. And the Dallas Fed has a longstanding preference for outspoken leaders.
Mr. Fisher's predecessor, Robert D. McTeer, was known for reciting cowboy poetry and for his disagreements with the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan. When Mr. Fisher took the job, he changed the hold music on the Dallas Fed's phone system from country and western to classical.
The Dallas Fed's board has yet to select Mr. Fisher's successor, but Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial in Chicago, said it was a good bet they would pick someone with a strong voice. "They like to have people who are cowboys," she said.
He was one of the first Fed officials to raise concerns about the health of the housing market. Yet he was also among the last to understand the depth of the resulting financial crisis. He warned throughout most of 2008 that inflation was the primary danger to the economy -- a threat that has still not materialized -- and that the bleak pronouncements of other Fed officials were fueling an unwarranted sense of panic.
In August, as the financial system teetered on the brink of collapse, he voted to raise interest rates, which would have made the situation even worse.
In December that year, when the Fed reduced its benchmark interest rate nearly to zero in a move to spur a recovery, Mr. Fisher cast the only dissenting vote. After the meeting, he decided the moment required solidarity and went to Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman, to change his vote.
But Mr. Fisher said in the interview here that he had not changed his mind. He said the Fed should never have pushed interest rates below 2 percent, nor bought so many bonds.
Like many of the Fed's critics on the left, Mr. Fisher emphasizes that he is deeply concerned about the damage caused by the Great Recession. He says he simply does not believe the Fed is helping. He says holding down interest rates has mostly enriched the rich, like his own family.
The middle class is being squeezed, he said, "but the Fed can't fix that."
The Fed's current chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, sometimes uses the metaphor of a car to talk about monetary policy. Mr. Fisher said he had frequently argued for the substitution of a ship "because there are no brakes."
He told of serving as a student at the Naval Academy on the U.S.S. Truckee, a tanker, as it collided with an aircraft carrier, the U.S.S. Wasp, in June 1968.
"The scariest thing was watching all the other ships pull over the horizon," he said, and then draws the metaphor: The Fed's portfolio, which has swelled to more than $4 trillion, is "an enormous amount of explosive fuel" and the danger is "an explosion of inflation."
"My successors," he said, "are going to have to be very careful in steering that ship."

Full text:   Stocks advanced on Friday, capping a strong week, helped by a recovery in the price of oil and earnings from the Olive Garden owner Darden Restaurants and the sportswear giant Nike.
The Nasdaq edged closer to the nominal high it reached at the height of the dot-com bubble.
Once again, it was the Federal Reserve affecting much of this week's market movement. The Fed implied at the end of its two-day meeting on Wednesday that its policy makers were in no hurry to raise interest rates with the economy still growing slowly and inflation extremely low. Friday's rally was partly an extension of that, strategists said.
"The trepidation in the market before the Fed announcement has disappeared," said Kristina Hooper, United States investment strategist at Allianz Global Investments.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 168.62 points, or 0.9 percent, to 18,127.65. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 18.83 points, or 0.9 percent, to 2,108.10.
The Nasdaq added 34.04 points, or 0.7 percent, to 5,026.42, 22 points from the high of 5,048 it hit in March 2000. It has taken the Nasdaq 15 years to recover nominally from the dot-com bubble, while the S.&P. 500 and Dow reached their previous highs, not adjusted for inflation, in 2007 and 2006.
Nike was among the biggest gainers on the Dow on Friday, rising $3.66, or 3.7 percent, to $101.98. Nike beat expectations, but investors focused more on foreign sales that remained strong despite the rising dollar and overseas market volatility.
The rapid rise in the dollar has been a particular sore spot for investors. The dollar is up more than 8 percent against the major currencies, which makes goods made in the United States more expensive abroad and has had a negative impact on sales. The dollar rose to 120.09 yen from 120.76 yen on Thursday. The euro rose to $1.0809 from $1.0668 the previous day.
The latest example was the jewelry maker Tiffany, which cut its full-year profit forecast, saying the higher dollar was making its products less attractive to foreign buyers. Shares of Tiffany fell $3.44, or 4 percent, to $82.93.
"The dollar's appreciation has been rapid and it's become a problem for many of these companies who have significant exposure to foreign markets," said Russ Koesterich, BlackRock's global chief investment strategist.
Darden said its same-store sales rose 3.6 percent in the most recent quarter, and lifted its outlook for the full year. Its shares rose $1.88, or 3 percent, to $66.75.
Oil also helped the market on Friday. After dropping more than 3 percent on Thursday, the United States benchmark oil for April delivery rose $1.76, or 4 percent, to $45.72 a barrel. Energy stocks rose far more than the rest of the market. The S.&P. 500's energy sector gained 2 percent.
Oil ended a volatile week up 2 percent even after dropping to its lowest level in six years on Tuesday. Oil inventories are at record highs, but the number of rigs drilling for oil is falling fast and a sliding dollar is making oil a more attractive investment to overseas buyers. Brent crude, the international standard, rose 89 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $55.32 a barrel.
In other futures trading on the Nymex, wholesale gasoline rose 2.4 cents to close at $1.798 a gallon; heating oil rose 1.2 cents to close at $1.734 a gallon; and natural gas fell 2.7 cents to close at $2.786 per 1,000 cubic feet.
Government bond prices rose. The 10-year Treasury note rose by 11/32 to 100 20/32. Its yield fell to 1.93 percent from 1.97 percent late Thursday.

Full text:   More than a year has passed since President Obama directed the Labor Department to revamp the nation's outdated rules on overtime pay, which are basically stuck in the 1970s. A February deadline is long gone and there has been no proposal.
Secretary of Labor Thomas Perez told a House committee this week that officials were, yes, working "overtime" to issue a proposal. He did not commit to a due date. The delay appears to be the result of disagreements between the Labor Department and the White House. The most pressing task is to raise the threshold at which salaried workers cease to be automatically eligible for overtime. It is now $455 a week, having barely budged since 1975. By many relevant benchmarks, it should be about $1,000 a week.
Last year, Mr. Obama's call for new overtime rules was a politically useful way to differentiate Democrats from Republicans in the midterm campaigns. But now it's time to raise the threshold. Twenty-six Democratic senators wrote to Mr. Obama seeking a threshold of at least $1,090 a week, adjusted yearly for inflation. The letter, which was sent shortly before the original Feb. 15 deadline for proposed rules, reflected a view among labor activists that the White House was pushing the Labor Department to propose a much lower number.
The senators were clear that a weekly threshold below $1,090 would be unjustifiable. Under federal law, employers are supposed to pay time and a half not only to hourly workers but also to salaried workers who are not in the "white collar" ranks as executives and administrators. The problem is that many employers give low-paid salaried workers titles like shift supervisor and assistant manager and then claim a "white collar exemption" to deny them time and a half for overtime. An adequate salary threshold is essential to separating those who are eligible for overtime from those who are not.
The Labor Department and the White House are back at the drawing board. But unless a workable proposal is issued soon, Mr. Obama's term could end before the rules are completed. If a Republican wins the presidency in 2016, rule changes not yet in effect could be dropped.
A workable proposal would recommend a threshold of at least $1,000. It would avoid the mistake of offering two or more possible thresholds -- an approach that would effectively invite business to dictate where to set the new level. It would have no other goal than fully restoring time and a half for overtime as the law intends.

Full text:   SEATTLE -- IN the year since 43 people died in a landslide in Oso, Wash., we have often been asked, as researchers who investigated this tragedy, how many other potential landslide disasters exist around the country.
Geologists and engineers certainly have the capability to find out. But the technological tools developed over the past several decades have not yet been put to work to develop detailed, reliable maps of landslide hazards nationwide. So no one really knows the answer.
The Oso disaster was one of the deadliest single landslides in recent history. After several weeks of heavy rainfall, roughly 10 million cubic yards of sand, gravel and mud cascaded down the side of a valley and surged across the valley bottom, destroying a residential community. Though the consequences of the Oso slide were particularly devastating, the United States Geological Survey has estimated that, on average, landslides kill 25 to 50 people a year in the United States, though typically in smaller events that attract less media attention.
Landslides occur in all 50 states -- even the relatively flat ones. But they plague mountainous regions in California, Colorado and the Pacific Northwest, and are common throughout Appalachia and New England.
Often set off by heavy rains or earthquakes, landslides may strike suddenly, but they are hardly random. Geologists can identify landslide-prone slopes, even if it is more difficult to predict when they will fail and how far they will travel when they do.
Over the past decade, the science of landslide mapping has advanced rapidly, largely because of improvements in remote sensing technologies that allow us to see Earth's surface in unprecedented detail. Today, it would be possible to create high-resolution hazard maps for the entire nation for significantly less than the estimated $1 billion or more in losses that landslides cause each year in the United States.
These high-resolution maps are available in other countries, including New Zealand, Italy and Switzerland, where they provide valuable information to citizens and public officials about risks. They guide land-use policy and allow people to make informed decisions before buying or building a home.
In the United States, however, few landslide hazard maps include quantitative estimates of the likelihood of landslides. State and local mapping programs have been hampered by a lack of money and, in some cases, politics. Concern about the impact of mapping on development was among the factors that led the North Carolina Legislature to shut down a hazard-mapping initiative in 2011. The effort was begun in 2004 after landslides killed five people in the state.
You don't need to be a geologist to understand that these hazard maps should identify where landslides have happened, where new ones are likely to occur and how much land they may overrun. Yet few landslide hazard assessments cover all of those bases.
Consider, for example, the case of the nurse who bought her dream house just days before she died in the Oso slide. Hazard maps identified the steep slope across the river from her home as a landslide zone. But the flat land where she had just moved was not described as at risk. How could she have known that she was moving into harm's way?
A decade ago, the National Research Council, an arm of the National Academies that provides advice on science and technology, recommended a major national landslide assessment program that would have included money for state geological surveys to evaluate or re-evaluate landslide hazards using modern technologies. The council's study estimated that the effort would cost $20 million in the initial stages of a 10-year program and up to $50 million a year in the final three years.
However, the program never materialized, and annual financing for the Geological Survey to research and evaluate hazards has remained essentially flat over the last decade when adjusted for inflation. The current budget for the program is $3.5 million.
Few homeowners have the expertise to realistically assess landslide hazards themselves, and even if they did, landslide insurance is not commonly available. With extreme weather events expected to become increasingly common, we need to commit to a program to systematically map landslide hazards across the nation and use that information to reduce landslide risks.
Millions of us live, work and play on or below slopes that may one day turn against us. But until we begin to better identify, map and mitigate the risks, we can expect landslides to continue to exact a toll in human lives.

Abstract: Earlier Wednesday afternoon, the Fed's policy committee had removed a promise to be "patient" about raising interest rates from its written statement, something financial markets have anticipated for months as a sign that interest rate increases are coming soon.

Full text:   The key words in Janet L. Yellen's news conference Wednesday were rather pithy, at least by central bank standards. "Just because we removed the word 'patient' from the statement doesn't mean we are going to be impatient," Ms. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, said.
With this framing, Ms. Yellen was putting her firm stamp on the policy of an institution she has led for just over a year -- and making clear that she will not be boxed in. Her words and accompanying announcements conveyed the message that the Yellen Fed has no intention of taking the support struts of low interest rates away until she is absolutely confident that economic growth will hold up without them.
Earlier Wednesday afternoon, the Fed's policy committee had removed a promise to be "patient" about raising interest rates from its written statement, something financial markets have anticipated for months as a sign that interest rate increases are coming soon. But Ms. Yellen managed a delicate task of changing that language to obtain flexibility without setting the Fed on a preordained course to tighter money.
Ms. Yellen's comments about patience versus impatience were part of that dance. But the dual message was even more powerful when combined with other elements of the central bank's newly released information, which sent the signal that members of the committee intend to move cautiously on rate increases.
By eliminating the reference to "patience," Paul Edelstein, an economist at IHS Global Insight, said in a research note, "The Fed did what it was expected to do."
"But beyond that," he added, "the committee appeared much more dovish and in not much of a hurry to actually pull the trigger."
Fed officials' forecasts of how high rates will be at year's end for 2015, 2016 and 2017 all fell compared to where they were in December. They marked down their forecast for economic growth and inflation for all three years, implying that the nation's economic challenge is tougher and inflation risks more distant than they had seemed a few months ago.
Particularly interesting was that Fed officials lowered their estimate of the longer-run unemployment rate, to 5 to 5.2 percent, from 5.2 to 5.5 percent. With joblessness hitting 5.5 percent in February, that implied that policy makers are convinced the job market has more room to tighten before it becomes too tight. Fed leaders now forecast unemployment rates in 2016 and 2017 that are a bit below what many view as the long-term sustainable level, which one would expect to translate into rising wages.
In other words, they want to run the economy a little hot for the next couple of years to help spur the kinds of wage gains that might return inflation to the 2 percent level they aim for, but which they have persistently undershot in recent years.
Apart from the details of the dovish monetary policy signals Ms. Yellen and her colleagues sent, it is clear she wanted to jolt markets out of any feeling that policy is on a preordained path.
At times over the last couple of years, the Fed had seemed to set a policy course and then go on a forced march until it got there, regardless of whether the jobs numbers were good or bad, or whether inflation was rising or falling. That is certainly how it felt when the Fed decided in December 2013 to wind down its quantitative easing policies by $10 billion per meeting, which it did through the first nine months of 2014 with few signs of re-evaluation as conditions evolved.
In her first news conference as chairwoman a year ago, Ms. Yellen had suggested that rate increases might be on a similar preordained path by saying that she could imagine rate increases "around six months" after the conclusion of quantitative easing. (That comment increasingly looks to have been a rookie mistake, and she later backed away from it.)
Since then, the job market has shown strong improvement, particularly in terms of jobs added and the falling unemployment rate. But meaningful wage gains are still lacking. Meanwhile, oil prices have plummeted and the dollar has risen on global markets, both of which are pushing inflation far below the Fed's 2 percent target (leaders of the central bank expect inflation of 0.6 to 0.8 percent in 2015).
There are likely to be plenty of twists and turns in the coming months. After this week's meeting, Ms. Yellen reinforced the message she has been trying to convey that the committee really will adapt its policy to incoming information rather than simply carry on with the path it set a year ago.
If the strengthening dollar and falling oil prices start to translate into still-lower expectations for future inflation, the Fed will hold off from rate rises -- and the same if wage gains and other job market indicators show a lack of progress.
Conversely, if the job market recovery keeps going gangbusters and it becomes clear that inflation is going to rise back toward 2 percent, Ms. Yellen does not want to be constrained by language about "patience."
"This change does not necessarily mean that an increase will occur in June," Ms. Yellen said, "though we cannot rule that out."
She has now bought herself some latitude to decide when and how the Fed ushers in an era of tighter money. Now the question is just how patient or impatient American economic conditions will allow her to be.

Obama Chides G.O.P. Over Proposed Program Cuts

Abstract: Republicans have shown little interest in forging compromises with Mr. Obama on domestic initiatives that animate his party's core supporters, like free community college, subsidies for child care and paid leave, while Democrats are reluctant to back him on his bid for new trade deals.

Full text:   CLEVELAND -- President Obama on Wednesday denounced the Republicans' latest budget as stingy and shortsighted, taking them to task for proposing to cut domestic programs that he said would yield more jobs and economic benefits for working people who are struggling financially.
During an appearance here, Mr. Obama announced new initiatives -- including about $230 million in federal money -- to aid American manufacturers, and he argued that the Republican plan would set back the nation's economic recovery and hurt workers who have not yet had the chance to profit from it.
"The budget that they're putting forward and the theories they're putting forward are a path to prosperity for those who have already prospered," Mr. Obama said in a harsh assessment of Republicans' economic vision. "It's a story of retreat."
In a 36-minute speech to the City Club of Cleveland that credited his own policies for the economy's comeback, the president cast Republicans as naysayers clinging to the idea of tax cuts for the wealthy financed by slashing programs for everyone else. He said that they were "doubling down on trickle-down" economics while pretending to care about the middle class.
"If they believe it's time to end the social contract that sustains so many of us, the basic bargain of shared sacrifice and shared responsibility, own it and make the argument, but you can't credibly claim that this vision is about helping working families get ahead," he told an audience of about 450.
The trip was an example of how Mr. Obama is trying to compensate for his lack of clout in the Republican-held Congress by using the trappings of the presidency outside Washington. He is hoping to build public support for his domestic agenda in an attempt to pressure Republicans to compromise with him.
But the tactic has not proved successful so far, and on Wednesday, Republicans criticized Mr. Obama for attacking them rather than pushing bipartisan priorities like loosening restrictions on international trade and bolstering cybersecurity laws -- agenda items where Democrats are his most troublesome adversaries.
"If President Obama was serious about expanding growth and opportunity, he'd be working with Republicans on areas of common ground," said Cory Fritz, a spokesman for John A. Boehner, the speaker of the House. "Today's stop in Cleveland was nothing more than a political stunt designed to double down on the same tax-and-spend policies that have failed middle-class families."
Mr. Obama's speech amounted to an I-told-you-so defense of his policies, in which he shot down Republicans' harshest claims and predictions about his agenda -- including warnings of job losses, stock market drops, $6.60 per gallon gas and trillion-dollar deficits.
He even referred to Mr. Boehner's "Where are the jobs?" campaign mantra.
"Well, after 12 million new jobs, a stock market that's more than doubled, deficits that have been cut by two-thirds, health care inflation at the lowest rate in nearly 50 years, manufacturing coming back, auto industry coming back, clean energy doubled, I've come not only to answer that question, but I want to return to the debate that is central to this country and the alternative economic theory that's presented by the other side," Mr. Obama said.
Don Stewart, a spokesman for Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, said the visit raised questions about when Mr. Obama "is going to get off the campaign trail and start trying to get things done."
"Imagine if he was going there to push for his trade agenda, or any of the other items on his agenda that are being slowed by Democrats," Mr. Stewart said.
Indeed, Mr. Obama's stop in Cleveland, a city in the Rust Belt where skepticism about international trade agreements runs high, underscored the political squeeze facing the president as he pushes to accomplish major elements of his agenda during his final two years in office. Republicans have shown little interest in forging compromises with Mr. Obama on domestic initiatives that animate his party's core supporters, like free community college, subsidies for child care and paid leave, while Democrats are reluctant to back him on his bid for new trade deals.
The budget debate unfolding in Washington this week dramatizes Mr. Obama's rift with Republicans. They are advocating holding to strict spending caps that would force deep cuts in national security and social programs, while the president wants to lift the limits in both areas by a total of about $75 billion.
Mr. Obama's speech highlighted the differences between him and most Republicans.
"It was one thing for them to argue against Obamacare before it was put in place," Mr. Obama said. "It's working even better than I expected, but it doesn't matter -- evidence be damned -- it's still 'a disaster.' Well, why?"
At the same time, during a nearly 45-minute question-and-answer session after his speech, Mr. Obama criticized the political division that he said prevented like-minded Republicans from teaming with him even on basic things like funding the government or devoting federal money to building roads and bridges, an area in which Mr. Obama has repeatedly said he believes there is room for a bipartisan deal.
"Constant campaigning and the polarization of the bases and the inability, it seems, to just agree on a core set of facts means even when some of our Republican friends want to work with us, it's hard to do," he said. "They are worried that they'll get attacked, or they'll be viewed as compromisers, or they'll get a primary challenge by somebody further to the right."

Full text:   Stocks rallied on Thursday after the Federal Reserve signaled that it might move slowly to raise interest rates.
While the central bank left open the possibility of a rate increase later in the year, policy makers also lowered their assessment of the economy and noted that inflation was likely to remain low.
Investors had expected the Fed to signal that it was close to raising rates, possibly as early as June, and were surprised by the cautious tone that policy makers struck on the outlook for the economy.
Stocks swung from losses earlier in the day to big gains after the statement was released. Bonds also rallied, pushing the yield on the 10-year Treasury note back below 2 percent. The dollar plunged against the euro.
"There is very little to suggest that the Fed is going to raise rates aggressively this year," said Jeremy Zirin, an investment strategist at UBS Wealth Management.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 25.22 points, or 1.2 percent, to 2,099.50. The index had been down as much as 11 points before the release of the Fed's statement at 2 p.m. Eastern time.
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 227.11 points, or 1.3 percent, to 18,076.19. The Nasdaq composite index rose 45.39 points, or 0.9 percent, to 4,982.83.
Energy companies led the gains for stocks as the price of oil spiked after the Fed's statement. Lower rates tend to make oil and other hard assets more attractive investments, increasing their prices. The energy sector in the S.&P. 500 rose 2.9 percent.
Benchmark United States crude rose $1.20 to close at $44.66 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, a benchmark for international oils used by many American refineries, rose $2.40 to close at $55.91 a barrel in London.
Fed policy makers have held their benchmark interest rate close to zero since 2008 to help the economy recover from the Great Recession. Low rates make it easier for businesses and consumers to borrow and spend. They have also helped the stock market soar over the last six years, pushing major stock indexes to record levels.
The Fed's statement confirmed that stocks remained in a "Goldilocks" environment, where growth is solid, but not strong enough to stoke inflation, said Mr. Zirin at UBS.
"This still seems to be the sweet spot for equity investors, where you should see decent, but unspectacular earnings gains," he said.
Shares of General Mills were up 81 cents, or 1.6 percent, after the company said that it had completed a plan to eliminate about 800 positions. General Mills, which makes Cheerios cereal, Yoplait yogurt and other packaged foods, also reported mixed results for its fiscal third quarter as a stronger dollar pressured sales.
Shares of FedEx dropped $2.41, or 1.4 percent, to $173.30 after the company reported that its third-quarter profit rose more than 50 percent and beat Wall Street expectations.
In currency trading, the dollar slumped, reversing a recent surge against the euro.
It was lower against the euro, weakening almost 3 percent to $1.0894. The dollar had traded as low as $1.05 earlier this week. The dollar weakened to 119.85 yen from 121.34 yen late Tuesday.
Government bond prices increased. The 10-year Treasury note rose 1 6/32 to 100 23/32. Its yield fell to 1.92 percent from 2.05 percent on Tuesday.
Metals were mixed. Gold rose $3.10, or 0.3 percent, to $1,151.30 an ounce. Silver fell 4 cents, or 0.2 percent, to $15.54 an ounce. Copper dropped 6 cents, or 2.4 percent, to $2.57 a pound.

Full text:   MOSCOW -- General Motors on Wednesday announced plans to largely withdraw from the Russian market by the end of the year, becoming the most prominent company to date to express a lack of confidence in the deeply troubled economy.
The move reverses years of G.M. investments in Russia, where car sales had boomed. Now, however, the country is struggling with low oil prices and sanctions on its banks, and its economy is expected to contract 4 percent this year.
"This decision avoids significant investment into a market that has very challenging long-term prospects," G.M.'s president, Daniel Ammann, said in a statement.
Since Russia annexed Crimea last year and its economy has faltered, other multinational companies have left. G.M. said it would shutter its main factory in the country and wind down sales of Opel brand cars. The decision, the company said, will cost $600 million this year in severance pay to Russian workers and other one-time expenses.
For a time, the Russian automotive market had been expected to surpass that of Germany in sales volume. But in February, car sales were down 38 percent across the board compared with a year earlier.
"This change in our business model in Russia is part of our global strategy to ensure long-term sustainability in markets where we operate," Mr. Ammann added.
Largely exiting Russia as it goes into recession even as the rest of Europe is projected to eke out some growth will help the automaker return its overall European division to profitability by next year, the company said.
Multinational companies have been nervous about their Russian operations. Last summer, Russian regulators singled out McDonald's in a campaign of politically hued inspections, raising fears of a potential backlash against American sanctions on Russia for its role in the Ukraine crisis.
No signs of wide-scale regulatory pressure, though, have emerged. Instead, the Russian economy has simply slowed because of falling oil prices and sanctions, so that Russian consumers are no longer such a coveted group.
Russians' inflation-adjusted incomes are declining this year for the first time since 2009, and for only the second time during the tenure of President Vladimir V. Putin. Because of the collapse of the ruble in December, Russians' incomes have plummeted: The average salary peaked in 2013 at $800 a month, and is projected this year to be about $400.
The hamburger chain Wendy's has wound down business in Russia, as has the clothing store Esprit.
The announcement from G.M. suggests that the carmaker is abandoning its bets on a rising Russian middle class, as it will cancel low-end models but still market the Cadillac and other expensive cars to the rich.
The company will focus on premium brands in its lineup, like Corvette and Tahoe, along with Cadillac, while shuttering its car assembly plant in St. Petersburg, which had been mass-producing midsize Opel vehicles. All Opel sales will end this year.
Russian regulation that encourages localization, and job creation, by requiring carmakers to commit to ever-greater use of locally produced parts also appeared to play a role in the decision. Opel said it made no sense to invest in further localization in a shrinking market.
In St. Petersburg, a local official blamed the company, saying its cars were not selling well. G.M. had "an unlucky lineup of models," Maksim Meiksin, the head of a committee for industrial policy in St. Petersburg, told the news agency Tass. Workers would be placed at other factories, he said.
Some business will continue. G.M. zoomed into Russia before other carmakers in the 1990s, setting up a joint venture at a storied Russian plant, the Volga Automobile Factory, the maker of Ladas, to manufacture a sport utility vehicle. That venture will go on, but not expand, the statement said.
A separate contract with another Russian plant, the Gorky Automotive Factory, in Nizhny Novgorod, will wind down by the end of the year, ending a brief revival there of a long tradition of American and Russian automobile cooperation; Henry Ford sold the first assembly line there to the Soviet Union in the 1930s.
In addition to severance pay, the $600 million one-time charge for General Motors' partial pullout from Russia will cover contract cancellations, restructuring at dealerships and lost tax incentives, the company said.

Sweden's Central Bank Cuts Interest Rate Again, to Minus 0.25%

Abstract: The Swedish central bank's move on Wednesday followed a similar cut last month, and it came just hours before a meeting of the Federal Reserve in Washington, where the chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, and her colleagues on the Fed's main policy committee were expected by many analysts to signal their readiness to raise interest rates, which are still near zero more than six years after the Lehman Brothers collapse in 2008.

Full text:   The Swedish central bank on Wednesday again cut its main interest rate, bringing it deeper into negative territory to head off deflationary pressures.
The executive board of the Swedish Riksbank said that it had cut its main rate target by 0.15 percentage point to minus 0.25 percent, and that it would buy government bonds valued at 30 billion kronor, or about $3.5 billion, over the next few months.
The bank said in a statement that it saw signs "that inflation has bottomed out and is beginning to rise," but that the strength of the currency "risks breaking this trend." The measures on Wednesday were intended "to support the upturn in inflation," said the Riksbank, which signaled its "readiness to do more at short notice."
Sweden, like its Nordic neighbor Denmark and most countries along the perimeter of the eurozone, is fighting to keep its appreciating currency from pushing inflation, already at dangerously low levels, into outright deflation.
Economists fear that the self-reinforcing spiral of falling prices will weigh on growth and hurt banks and borrowers. That has led central banks in Denmark, Sweden and Switzerland to set negative rates, in effect taxing the money that banks hold rather than lend to the real economy. The European Central Bank, in its own fight against deflation, is also using negative rates.
Sweden's bond-buying program, while small compared with the 60 billion euros, or about $63.5 billion, the European Central Bank has said it will buy each month until September 2016, is intended to drive down bond yields, in theory restarting lending and helping the economy to grow faster. The policy, known as quantitative easing, has also been employed by the Federal Reserve in the United States, the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan, with mixed results.
In the case of the European Central Bank, the main impact so far appears to be in pushing the euro sharply lower against the dollar.
The Swedish central bank's move on Wednesday followed a similar cut last month, and it came just hours before a meeting of the Federal Reserve in Washington, where the chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, and her colleagues on the Fed's main policy committee were expected by many analysts to signal their readiness to raise interest rates, which are still near zero more than six years after the Lehman Brothers collapse in 2008.
Considering the prospect of a Fed interest rate increase and the low-inflation environment, partly attributed to low oil prices, the Riksbank warned on Wednesday that an appreciation of the Swedish currency "could break off the upturn in inflation that has begun, so that it fails to rise sufficiently quickly."
The central bank has had to backtrack enormously since it began raising its key rate in 2010 and reached 2 percent in 2011. That earned criticism from economists, who said it was overlooking the danger of falling prices as it girded against nonexistent inflation.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve on Wednesday moved to the verge of raising interest rates for the first time since the economy fell into recession more than seven years ago, even as officials suggested that the Fed might not pull the trigger until well into the second half of the year.
In a statement released after a two-day meeting of its policy-making committee, the Fed said that it would consider raising its benchmark rate as early as June, and it removed from the statement a promise that it would be "patient."
Yet the Fed tempered that message on Wednesday, including the release of economic forecasts by its senior officials that showed they now think the unemployment rate can still fall significantly without setting off higher inflation. That conveyed an impression that Fed officials may feel less urgency about raising interest rates so soon.
"Just because we removed the word 'patient' from the statement doesn't mean we're going to be impatient," Janet L. Yellen, the Fed's chairwoman, said at a news conference after the statement's release. Ms. Yellen said the Fed was not declaring an intention to raise rates in June, "although we can't rule that out."
Her remarks suggested that borrowers have a few more months to take advantage of exceptionally low interest rates on mortgages and car loans, while savers face a few more months of exceptionally meager returns on their low-risk investments. And even after the Fed raises its crucial interest rate, borrowing costs may well remain comparatively low well into the future.
Investors celebrated like the recipients of a last-minute reprieve.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 1.2 percent to close at 2,099.50. Bond prices also jumped, driving the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond to its largest one-day decline since October. The yield fell 0.13 points to 1.92 percent.
Evan A. Schnidman, chief executive of Prattle Analytics, which analyzes central bank communications, said the Fed surprised many investors because the public remarks of Fed officials over the last year have consistently pointed to an earlier start date for rate increases than the Fed's official statements.
"Although they are individually eager to normalize policy, they are collectively reticent about the possibility of raising rates prematurely," Mr. Schnidman said.
The march toward higher rates may be slow, but it still looks all but certain to begin at some point this year. That reflects the Fed's optimism that the economy no longer needs quite as much help from central bank stimulus and a sense of fatigue with the Fed's long-running campaign to encourage faster economic growth.
Many Americans are still struggling to find good jobs, while the sluggish pace of inflation suggests that the economy still has room to grow more quickly without setting off alarm bells that prices will escalate beyond a comfortable level. The Fed acknowledged in its statement that growth had "moderated somewhat" in recent months, and that inflation had sagged even further below its 2 percent target, a level most economists consider appropriate to a healthy economy.
There are also growing concerns that the stronger dollar, which has been rising partly on expectations that the Fed will raise rates while other central banks are cutting them, will hurt American exports and reduce corporate investment. The rise of the dollar also appears to be worsening the weakness of inflation. Low inflation is a sign of economic weakness and can also be a cause of it, for example, by making it harder to repay debts.
The forecasts published by the Fed showed that 15 of the 17 members of the policy-making committee expect to raise the Fed's benchmark rate this year. Those projections showed that on average they expect two increases, to roughly 0.75 percent. The Fed has held short-term rates near zero since December 2008.
"I think some of the headwinds that have long been holding the economy back are beginning to recede," Ms. Yellen said at her news conference. Monetary policy exerts a gradual influence on economic conditions, so the Fed must anticipate the trajectory of growth when it makes policy. Ms. Yellen said officials were inclined to raise rates because they expected continued improvement in the labor market and a rebound in inflation that would move it closer to its desirable level.
In place of its recent promise to remain "patient" in deciding when to start raising rates, the committee's statement said that the Fed would act "when it has seen further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term."
The statement said the Fed "remains unlikely" to act at its next meeting, in April, turning the attention of investors to subsequent meetings. A number of analysts said they viewed the Fed's September meeting as the most likely date.
"While the Fed chose to explicitly drop the patient qualifier, the implicit patience remains intact," Michael Dolega, senior economist at TD Bank, wrote in a note to clients after the release of the statement. "The Fed does not yet appear to be convinced that the economy can withstand higher interest rates at this point, especially in an environment of weak external demand and a surging dollar."
The most striking changes on Wednesday were in the Fed's quarterly economic forecasts. Officials said they now expected economic output to expand 2.3 to 2.7 percent in 2015, a downgrade from their December estimate of 2.6 to 3 percent. Forecasts for 2016 and 2017 were also revised downward, the latest instance in the Fed's postcrisis pattern of repeatedly reducing its forecasts.
Officials also shaved their estimates of inflation. In 2015, they now project, prices will rise 0.6 to 0.8 percent, and then 1.7 to 1.9 percent in 2016.
Most consequentially, officials reduced their estimates of the lowest level of unemployment that is consistent with stable inflation. The average forecast of 5 to 5.2 percent was significantly lower than the December average of 5.2 to 5.5 percent and almost as low as the precrisis average. The changes reflected the reality that the unemployment rate has already reached the top of the old range without any evident sign of faster wage growth.
In keeping with these forecasts, Fed officials also pushed back their expectations about the timing and the pace of interest rate increases. After rates reach 0.75 percent by the end of this year, officials expect them to hit just 2 percent by the end of 2016.
The changes move the Fed's outlook closer to the expectations priced into bond markets in recent months, rewarding investors who bet that the Fed was again allowing its hopes to get ahead of the economic data.
"It is now clear the bond market is not moving toward the Fed; the Fed is moving toward the bond market," wrote Tim Duy, a professor of economics at the University of Oregon and a close watcher of the Fed. "By moving toward the markets on the path of rate hikes, the Fed acknowledges that they are eager to let this recovery run on."
Alongside the debate about the timing of rate increases, there is growing concern that whenever the Fed moves, it will disrupt financial markets. At a minimum, The Fed is on track to be the first major central bank to start raising interest rates, and it is also intentionally introducing greater uncertainty. Wednesday's statement represented the end of the Fed's crisis-era practice of providing explicit guidance about its plans for interest rates.
In a note to clients last week, the hedge fund manager Ray Dalio cautioned that if the Fed did tighten too soon, it would have little ability to correct the mistake because it has already exhausted the standard arsenal of monetary policy.
"We don't know -- nor does the Fed know -- exactly how much tightening will knock over the apple cart," Mr. Dalio said in the note, which made the rounds on Wall Street because of his prominence and its unusually foreboding tone. "What we do hope the Fed knows, which we don't know, is how exactly it will fix things if it knocks it over."

Full text:   LONDON -- The British election campaign now underway here revolves in large part around a single issue: the economy, and whether its rebound is the result of an austerity policy championed by the Conservative-led government, or in spite of it.
Similar questions are being debated throughout Europe, but in the wake of the global recession after the 2008-9 financial crisis, few nations veered more sharply than Britain toward the theory that getting deficits and debt under control was a precondition to a sustained recovery.
As the May election approaches, Prime Minister David Cameron is making the case that austerity worked -- the economy is growing strongly and unemployment is down sharply -- and promising an even tougher fiscal stance that would slice deeply into many government programs.
His platform is being challenged by a broad spectrum of critics. The Church of England, for one, is urging more "moral authority" and criticizing inequality and low-paying jobs.
But the campaign is also focusing attention on key elements of the economic debate: How much austerity did the government actually impose? Is Britain's recovery a victory for budget cutting, or evidence that the country pulled out of its slump through continued if somewhat lower deficit spending combined with an aggressive effort to keep interest rates low?
Despite tough talk from Mr. Cameron and George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, the government continues to spend much more than it takes in. Its budget deficit of 5.5 percent of gross domestic product is considerably higher than that of the supposedly spendthrift Socialist government of France.
Mr. Osborne has failed to deliver on two key promises made when he and Mr. Cameron took office five years ago at the head of a coalition with the Liberal Democrats -- to run a cyclically adjusted balanced budget by this year and to begin to shrink Britain's cumulative government debt.
"By historical standards this has been significant austerity," said Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, a nonpartisan research institution that calculates the costs of political promises. "But despite the rhetoric, it's not a massive austerity, not compared to Ireland, Spain or Greece."
Mr. Osborne, he said, has "not been quite such an austere chancellor as either his own rhetoric or that of his critics might suggest."
Still, real spending by government departments is down 8 percent from 2010, when the budget deficit was more than 11 percent of G.D.P., a function of the Labour government's response to the global crash of 2008.
Yet because the economy did not grow as much as forecast, limiting tax revenue, the deficit did not fall as much as planned. The government made important reductions, delivering most of the cuts it promised. But those cuts mostly took place in the first two years, until 2012. As economists on both sides point out, the government eased off sharply after that. Austerity was essentially put off -- to a potential second term.
"They were faced with a choice -- to stick to the austerity plan, or to do something economically more sensible -- and they chose the latter," said Jonathan Portes, director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. "Though I'm not a great fan of this government, they made the right choice, and by comparison to what happened in the eurozone, everyone looks good."
In that sense, Mr. Cameron and Mr. Osborne have threaded the needle, cutting enough at the start to keep bond holders and core constituents happy, but at the same time, benefiting from a Keynesian recovery, fueled by deficit spending, while making the moral and ideological case that they are reducing the deficit over time.
Whatever the cuts so far, Mr. Osborne has vowed to swing a much broader ax to chop back the size of the state, renewing the Thatcher-era belief that a large state sector is wasteful and stifles creativity.
Mr. Osborne vows that his last budget before the election, to be delivered Wednesday, will contain "no giveaways, no gimmicks." He has promised an absolute budget balance by 2019, including investment spending, and a 1 percent surplus by 2020, which will mean a spending cut by government departments of 14 percent in real terms, some 38 billion pounds, over the next five years, a reduction on a scale never before seen.
According to Mr. Johnson, Mr. Osborne, by 2019, would bring the state's share of the economy to its lowest since World War II.
The impact, if the budget is adopted, would be substantial. While promising to cut some taxes and protect politically sensitive things like pensions and the National Health Service as well as foreign aid, Mr. Osborne will have to make disproportionate cuts in defense, policing and local government, hard choices in a time of renewed anxiety about security.
"Much low-hanging fruit has already been plucked," said Ryan Bourne, head of public policy at the right-leaning Institute of Economic Affairs. In his coming budget, Mr. Osborne may use the extra economic growth and the tax revenue it has produced to soften his targets slightly, especially with key Tories pushing to preserve military spending at 2 percent of G.D.P., the NATO guideline.
But he will not have much room to maneuver, since he has insisted that he will reach his goals through spending cuts, not tax increases.
"If you really do that," Mr. Johnson said, "then the rhetoric begins to match the reality, because you really are beginning to shrink the state."
He added that he has his doubts: "The size of the cuts in the nonprotected parts of the budget would be so high I'd be astonished if this happens." Polling suggests it is unlikely that the Conservatives will win an overall majority in Parliament, even if Mr. Cameron returns as prime minister, limiting their ability to enact their agenda.
The Labour Party has been vaguer about its economic plans, while generally committing itself to limit deficits and slow the increase in the public debt. But Labour is in no hurry to get started.
Mr. Johnson's institute published a "green budget" comparing the economic plans of the main parties. The differences are clear when it comes to the size of the government, with Labour projecting much less drastic spending cuts of roughly £9 billion over the next five years, less than a quarter of Tory plans.
Labour promises a balanced budget on everything except investment in infrastructure, for which Labour would continue to borrow, only by 2020.
The Conservatives are playing on voters' mistrust of Labour's economic management. They argue that with lower oil prices, stronger demand, lower inflation, more jobs, seven consecutive quarters of growth, and growth of about 3 percent last year, the economy looks pretty good, so why let Labour mess it up again?
In fact, the economy has significant problems, with G.D.P. per capita and real wages still lower than they were before the 2008 economic crisis, though household incomes have finally reached the 2008 level. Living standards are down, especially for young people who are getting lower pay and a smaller share of social benefits than their parents. Labor productivity is poor, and Britain is still running a large structural deficit, another indication that austerity has been much milder than in Ireland or Greece.
What took everyone by surprise, given the slow turnaround in the economy, has been the rebound in job creation, with unemployment now at 5.8 percent, down from 7.9 percent when the government took office. Yet because most of the new jobs are either part-time or not highly paid, they have produced less tax revenue.
With interest rates so low, many economists say it is wrong to worry about adding modest amounts of new debt and to insist on fiscal tightening that imperils the fragile recovery. Yet those who want to push down the debt now argue that if interest rates go up to traditional levels, servicing an increasing amount of debt will be extremely painful.
Mr. Johnson said that the cutbacks so far had encouraged the Treasury to push for more. "We got here with a lot less pain than I and others expected in 2010," Mr. Johnson said. "It's possible to rein in spending without things falling apart." At least so far.

Full text:   SOME arguments are hard to settle but are too important to avoid. Here is one: whether the social crisis among America's poor and working class -- the collapse of the two-parent family, the weakening of communal ties -- is best understood as a problem of economics or of culture.
This argument recurs whenever there's a compelling depiction of that crisis. In 2012, the catalyst was Charles Murray's "Coming Apart," with its portrait of the post-1960s divide between two fictional communities -- upper-class "Belmont" and blue-collar "Fishtown." Now it's Robert Putnam's "Our Kids," which uses the author's Ohio hometown to trace the divergent fortunes of its better-educated and less-educated families.
Murray belongs to the libertarian right, Putnam to the communitarian left, so Putnam is more hopeful that economic policy can address the problems he describes. But "Our Kids" is attuned to culture's feedback loops, and it offers grist for social conservatives who suspect it would take a cultural counterrevolution to bring back the stable working class families of an earlier America.
That idea makes some people on the left angry. As they see it, it's money and only money that Murray's Fishtown and Putnam's hometown lack and need. And it's unchecked capitalism and Republican stinginess, not the sexual revolution, that has devastated working-class society over the last few decades. Fight poverty, redistribute wealth, and you'll revive family and community -- it's as simple as that.
Their argument gets some things right. The American economy isn't performing as well as it once did for less-skilled workers. Certain regions -- like Putnam's Ohio -- have suffered painfully from deindustrialization. The shift to a service economy has favored women but has made low-skilled men less marriageable. The decline of unions has weakened professional stability and bargaining power for some workers.
And yet, for all these disturbances and shifts, lower-income Americans have more money, experience less poverty, and receive far more safety-net support than their grandparents ever did. Over all, material conditions have improved, not worsened, across the period when their communities have come apart.
Between 1979 and 2010, for instance, the average after-tax income for the poorest quintile of American households rose from $14,800 to $19,200; for the second-poorest quintile, it rose from $29,900 to $39,100.
Meanwhile, per-person antipoverty spending at the state and federal level increased sixfold between 1968 and 2008 -- and that's excluding Medicare, unemployment benefits and Social Security. Despite some conservative skepticism, this spending did reduce the poverty rate (though probably more so after welfare reform). One plausible estimate suggests the rate fell from 26 percent in 1967 to 15 percent in 2012, and child poverty fell as well.
These trends simply do not match the left-wing depiction of a working class devastated by Reagonomics. Nor does the long-term trend in insurance coverage, or per-student spending, or other data. The left sometimes claims that the income instability of working Americans is unprecedented, for instance -- but a 2007 Congressional Budget Office estimate found "little change in earnings variability" over the preceding decades.
This is a dense debate whose surface I can only skim. (Inequality as well as absolute income enters into it, as does immigration, cost inflation for key goods -- including weddings! -- and more.)
But the basic point is this: In a substantially poorer American past with a much thinner safety net, lower-income Americans found a way to cultivate monogamy, fidelity, sobriety and thrift to an extent that they have not in our richer, higher-spending present.
So however much money matters, something else is clearly going on.
The post-1960s cultural revolution isn't the only possible "something else." But when you have a cultural earthquake that makes society dramatically more permissive and you subsequently get dramatic social fragmentation among vulnerable populations, denying that there is any connection looks a lot like denying the nose in front of your face.
But recognizing that culture shapes behavior and that moral frameworks matter doesn't require thundering denunciations of the moral choices of the poor. Instead, our upper class should be judged first -- for being too solipsistic to recognize that its present ideal of "safe" permissiveness works (sort of) only for the privileged, and for failing to take any moral responsibility (in the schools it runs, the mass entertainments it produces, the social agenda it favors) for the effects of permissiveness on the less-savvy, the less protected, the kids who don't have helicopter parents turning off the television or firewalling the porn.
This judgment would echo Leonard Cohen:
Now you can say that I've grown bitter but of this you may be sure /
The rich have got their channels in the bedrooms of the poor.
And without dismissing money's impact on the social fabric, it would raise the possibility that what's on those channels sometimes matters more.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- United States producer prices fell in February for a fourth straight month, pointing to tame inflation that could argue against an anticipated June interest rate increase from the Federal Reserve.
The Labor Department said on Friday that its Producer Price Index for final demand declined 0.5 percent as profit margins in the services sector, especially gasoline stations, were squeezed, and transportation and warehousing costs fell.
"The underlying message appears to be that pipeline inflationary pressures remain quite weak, even as energy prices have stabilized and gasoline prices have drifted modestly higher," said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York.
The index dropped 0.8 percent in January. In the 12 months through February, it fell 0.6 percent, the first decline since the series was revamped in 2009. Economists had forecast an increase of 0.3 percent last month to a level unchanged from a year ago.
Prices for United States government debt gained marginally on the inflation data. United States stock indexes fell sharply, as a strong dollar threatened to erode the profits of multinational companies and tumbling crude prices pressured energy firms.
While the weak inflation backdrop would normally be associated with a struggling economy, there appears to be little reason to worry, given the fairly robust labor market.
"We would not take the producer prices report as a sign that the economy is secretly rotten if you pull back the tarp and take a look at the hull," said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York. "The economy is creating millions of jobs."
A separate report from the University of Michigan showed its consumer sentiment index fell 4.2 points, to 91.2, in early March. Lower- and middle-income households said harsh winter weather had left them with high utility bills and disrupted shopping and general business activity.
The inflation data came ahead of next week's Fed meeting, where policy makers are widely expected to signal the United States central bank's openness to a June rate increase by dropping a pledge to be "patient" in considering such a move because of strength in the labor market. As price pressures remain muted and retail sales extend their decline in February, the Fed could delay the move until September.
"The Fed is probably going to hike even if inflation stays low, whether it's June or September, because they are confident about the strong labor market conditions ultimately leading to higher inflation," said Michelle Girard, chief economist at RBS in Stamford, Conn.
Services accounted for 70 percent of the decline in the price index last month. The volatile trade services component, which mostly reflects profit margins at retailers and wholesalers, fell a record 1.5 percent in February.
It was pulled down by a 13.4 percent drop in margins at gasoline service stations, reflecting a recent plunge in prices at the pump. Profit margins also fell for apparel, footwear and jewelry retailers, as well as for food and alcohol.
There were also declines in machinery, equipment, parts and supplies wholesale margins, signs that a strong dollar -- it has appreciated more than 17 percent since July on a trade-weighted basis -- was helping to keep a lid on inflation.
A 1.5 percent drop in transportation and warehousing services also weighed on producer prices last month.
An important measure of underlying producer price pressures that excludes food, energy and trade services was unchanged after a record 0.3 percent drop in January.
"It suggests that the stronger dollar and second-round effects from the decline in energy are still suppressing pipeline inflation," said Blerina Uruci, an economist at Barclays in New York.

Asian Nations Rush to Lower Interest Rates, but Maybe Not Fast Enough

Abstract: "Asian central banks in general have been very relaxed in recent years about the economic outlook and risks around price stability," Frederic Neumann, a head of Asian economic research at HSBC, said in a telephone interview on Thursday. Last week, India lowered its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percentage points to 7.5 percent, with the central bank's saying the cut, its second between scheduled policy meetings, had been tied to easing inflation and weakness in the economy.

Full text:   HONG KONG -- Central banks across Asia are racing to cut interest rates, but they may not be doing it fast enough to stave off economic malaise.
The problem is weak inflation. Policy makers appear to have been surprised by how slowly prices are rising, and the slowdown is starting to weigh on economic growth across the region. If prices drop for too long, companies invest less and people's pay shrinks.
Asia is not experiencing such outright deflation yet, but the risks are rising. Inflation began weakening last year in the region, with the drastic drop in the global prices of oil and other commodities. Those declines now appear to be spreading throughout the Asian economy, and growth is slowing as a result.
"Asian central banks in general have been very relaxed in recent years about the economic outlook and risks around price stability," Frederic Neumann, a head of Asian economic research at HSBC, said in a telephone interview on Thursday. "China is an obvious example where deflation pressures have taken hold, but if you look everywhere from Korea to Southeast Asia, inflation is coming off much more rapidly than expected."
South Korea's central bank on Thursday reduced its benchmark rate to a low of 1.75 percent, a day after Thailand reduced rates for the first time in a year. Last week, India lowered its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percentage points to 7.5 percent, with the central bank's saying the cut, its second between scheduled policy meetings, had been tied to easing inflation and weakness in the economy. In recent months, China has cut interest rates twice and freed its banks to lend more.
The rush to lower rates in Asia is notable because the region is breaking with tradition and moving in a direction opposite to that of the United States. With the American economy rebounding smoothly and the job market appearing increasingly healthy, the United States Federal Reserve is expected to begin raising interest rates. In previous years, many central banks in Asia have tended to align their monetary policy with the Fed's.
That they are now moving in the opposite direction "brings home the strength of the disinflationary force that's gripping Asia," Mr. Neumann said. "It's relentless."
In China, data released this week showed a sharp deceleration in the already slowing economy, raising the pressure on policy makers to do more to stimulate growth. But China's central bank governor, Zhou Xiaochuan, defends his response.
"There must be prudence," Mr. Zhou said to reporters in Beijing on Thursday. The bank's actions so far, he said, were "maintaining appropriate liquidity in the financial markets, and they haven't overstepped the bounds."
His approach, he added, "remains unchanged, as steady and neutral."
In China's case, the picture is complicated because the country is still moving forward with several overhauls to its financial system. Mr. Zhou said Thursday that the government would introduce the country's first deposit insurance program in the coming months.
He also reiterated a pledge to deregulate interest rates charged by the country's banks. Limits on some of those rates have already been lifted, although deposit rates on savings accounts remain capped.
In statements released after they moved to cut rates, the central banks of South Korea and Thailand cited the slowdown in China -- previously the main engine of growth in the region and a major trading partner of both countries -- as a reason for their decisions.
There are signs that China's own recent easing actions, which since November have included two interest-rate cuts and a lowering of the amount of cash that banks are required to keep on reserve, have resulted in more lending. China's new credit growth in February was stronger than economists expected, with new local-currency loans rising 14.3 percent from a year earlier to 1 trillion renminbi, or $165 billion, according to figures released on Thursday.
But in China, as with elsewhere in Asia, being too neutral for too long may have led to problems. "Intensified policy easing can help cushion, but unlikely reverse, the downtrend in China's real economic growth," Tao Wang, the chief China economist at UBS, wrote Thursday in a research report.
Part of the problem is that the real cost of credit in China, after factoring in inflation, remains persistently high despite the recent easing measures.
Li-Gang Liu, the chief economist for greater China at the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, estimates that real borrowing rates for Chinese companies are more than 10 percent a year. That is based on an average bank lending rate of around 7 percent, and includes producer price inflation of around 4 percent.
Many companies in China have turned to even more expensive borrowing from the country's sprawling shadow banking sector, which includes players as diverse as trust companies and online lenders. But authorities, worried over spiraling amounts of loosely regulated credit, have been seeking to curtail such lenders.
"Bank lending is getting more important as shadow banking activities have been cracked down on," Mr. Liu wrote in an email. "Banks have become more risk averse in lending to trust companies, and shadow banking financing has dropped."
And then there is the uncertainty that could be introduced by the Fed. Rising interest rates in the United States and falling rates in Asia raise the risk that Asian nations could begin to see a shifting away of foreign currency. In China, there have been signs in recent months that this is taking place, as locals sell renminbi for dollars and move money offshore.
Mr. Zhou, the Chinese central bank governor, said this was to be expected if the Fed raised rates. "People in the financial markets may certainly consider now whether to buy more dollars, or to have some dollars stored abroad."
"But the signals from the U.S. Federal Reserve are that this move will be quite cautious and prudent," he said of the anticipated rate increase. "So from what we can see for now, we believe that this doesn't constitute a huge threat."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text:   We've been warned over and over that the Federal Reserve, in its effort to improve the economy, is "debasing" the dollar. The archaic word itself tells you a lot about where the people issuing such warnings are coming from. It's an allusion to the ancient practice of replacing pure gold or silver coins with "debased" coins in which the precious-metal content was adulterated with cheaper stuff. Message to the gold bugs and Ayn Rand disciples who dominate the Republican Party: That's not how modern money works. Still, the Fed's critics keep insisting that easy-money policies will lead to a plunging dollar.
Reality, however, keeps declining to oblige. Far from heading downstairs to debasement, the dollar has soared through the roof. (Sorry.) Over the past year, it has risen 20 percent, on average, against other major currencies; it's up 27 percent against the euro. Hooray for the strong dollar!
Or not. Actually, the strong dollar is bad for America. In an immediate sense, it will weaken our long-delayed economic recovery by widening the trade deficit. In a deeper sense, the message from the dollar's surge is that we're less insulated than many thought from problems overseas. In particular, you should think of the strong dollar/weak euro combination as the way Europe exports its troubles to the rest of the world, America very much included.
Some background: U.S. growth has improved lately, with employment rising at a pace not seen since the Clinton years. Yet the state of the economy still leaves a lot to be desired. In particular, the absence of much evidence for rising wages tells us that the job market is still weak despite the fall in the headline unemployment rate. Meanwhile, the returns America offers investors are ridiculously low by historical standards, with even long-term bonds paying only a bit more than 2 percent interest.
Currency markets, however, always grade countries on a curve. The United States isn't exactly booming, but it looks great compared with Europe, where the present is bad and the future looks worse. Even before the new Greek crisis blew up, Europe was starting to resemble Japan without the social cohesion: within the eurozone, the working-age population is shrinking, investment is weak and much of the region is flirting with deflation. Markets have responded to those poor prospects by pushing interest rates incredibly low. In fact, many European bonds are now offering negative interest rates.
This remarkable situation makes even those low, low U.S. returns look attractive by comparison. So capital is heading our way, driving the euro down and the dollar up.
Who wins from this market move? Europe: a weaker euro makes European industry more competitive against rivals, boosting both exports and firms that compete with imports, and the effect is to mitigate the euroslump. Who loses? We do, as our industry loses competitiveness, not just in European markets, but in countries where our exports compete with theirs. America has been experiencing a modest manufacturing revival in recent years, but that revival will be cut short if the dollar stays this high for long.
In effect, then, Europe is managing to export some of its stagnation to the rest of us. We're not talking about a nefarious plot, about so-called currency wars; it's just the way things work in a global economy with highly mobile capital and market-determined exchange rates.
And the effects may be quite large. If markets believe that Europe's weakness will last a long time, we would expect the euro to fall and the dollar to rise enough to eliminate much if not most of the difference in interest rates, which would mean severely crimping U.S. growth.
One thing that worries me is that I'm not at all sure that policy makers have fully taken the implications of a rising dollar into account. The Fed, still eager to raise interest rates despite low inflation and stagnant wages, seems to me to be too sanguine about the economic drag. And the most recent Fed minutes suggested that some members of the committee that governs monetary policy were thoroughly clueless, apparently believing that inflows of capital would make the U.S. economy stronger, not weaker.
Oh, and one more thing: a lot of businesses around the world have borrowed heavily in dollars, which means that a rising dollar may create a whole new set of debt crises. Just what the global economy needed.
Is there a policy moral to all this? One thing is that it's really important for all of us that Mario Draghi at the European Central Bank and associates succeed in steering Europe away from a deflationary trap; the euro is their currency, but it turns out to be our problem. Mainly, though, this is another reason for the Fed to fight the urge to pretend that the crisis is over. Don't raise rates until you see the whites of inflation's eyes!

Full text:   Mayor Bill de Blasio has appointed three new members of the board that sets rents for about one million rent-stabilized apartments in the city, completing the process of filling all nine seats with his selections just in time for the annual fight over rent increases.
This year the decisions of the Rent Guidelines Board will also play out against the backdrop of an even bigger fight in Albany over the renewal of state rent laws. Mr. de Blasio, who is focused on increasing and retaining affordable housing, is lobbying the State Legislature to strengthen rental protections to curb the number of stabilized units taken out of regulation each year.
But the city board is his best bet as he fights on two fronts to influence the cost of housing.
"This is now the de Blasio Rent Guidelines Board," said Harvey Epstein, a tenant representative who has served on the city board since 2012 and is also an associate director of the Urban Justice Center, which litigates on behalf of tenants. "The outcomes this year should reflect what the values of this administration are around long-term affordability," said Mr. Epstein, who was reappointed by the mayor last year.
But nothing is assured.
Last year, Mr. de Blasio called for a temporary rent freeze, but two of his appointees went with the majority and voted instead for historically low increases of 1 percent for one-year leases and 2.75 percent for leases of two years.
The board, which has a preliminary vote on new rent guidelines on April 29 and a final vote at the end of June, consists of two tenant representatives, two landlord representatives and five members of the public with experience in housing, finance or economics. Mr. de Blasio on Thursday replaced three holdovers from the administration of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg with two public members -- Helen Schaub and K. Sabeel Rahman -- and an owner representative, Scott Walsh.
Ms. Schaub is New York State director of policy and legislation at 1199 S.E.I.U. United Healthcare Workers East, representing 300,000 registered nurses, social workers and other health care workers in the state. Mr. Rahman teaches law at Brooklyn Law School and has advised the city and a wide variety of government and nongovernment organizations on economic and financial regulatory policy. Mr. Walsh is an architect and vice president for development at Forest City Ratner Companies, a major builder that has promised to build thousands of affordable apartments at its Pacific Park project in Brooklyn.
"The mayor has appointed a diverse and experienced group of members who understand the seriousness of our affordability crisis," a mayoral spokesman, Wiley Norvell, said.
But while tenant advocates say rent burdens have only gotten worse and persist on calling for rent freezes and even rollbacks, Mr. de Blasio has yet to let his wishes be publicly known.
Jack Freund, executive vice president of the Rent Stabilization Association, a landlords' group, said, "This is supposed to be an independent and objective board, and I would hope that they are."
The board staff released a report on Thursday showing that net operating income for rent-stabilized properties rose in 2013 for the ninth consecutive year, growing by 3.4 percent.
But landlords say the figure does not take into account costs that property owners incur in financing and renovating their properties.
The board staff will issue other reports, including one on affordability, to inform the board before its vote. The most recent Housing and Vacancy Survey by the Census Bureau, from the year 2014, showed that New York City rents rose faster than inflation since the previous survey in 2011, a trend that has particularly squeezed lower-income tenants.
And the rise was steeper for rent-stabilized apartments than for market-rate units, the survey showed.

Full text:   By imposing sanctions this week on seven officials in the Venezuelan government on Monday, the Obama administration took a gamble. The move appears intended to signal to members of that government that persecuting the political opposition and limiting an independent press will have consequences.
Yet the step could end up backfiring if President Nicolás Maduro is able to use it to bolster his bogus contention that the United States is trying oust him through a coup.
The sanctions, carried out under a law Congress passed in December, bar the Venezuelan officials from doing business with American citizens and permit the seizure of any assets they have in the United States. It also prevents them from traveling to the United States. American officials, however, seemed uncertain this week of the effect of the measures because it's unclear whether the blacklisted officials have substantial ties to the United States.
Unsurprisingly, Mr. Maduro called those who were singled out heroes and said that the sanctions were a badge of honor. Acting with characteristic brashness, he appointed one of the blacklisted officials, Gustavo Enrique González López, as the minister of interior on Tuesday. Mr. Maduro also asked the National Assembly, which his party controls, for extraordinary powers to face off American "aggression."
The sanctions were announced days after Mr. Maduro ordered the American Embassy in Caracas, the capital, to cut its staff to 17 from the roughly 100 employees based there now. He warned that his government would limit the activities of the few diplomats that remained, and he also said that American citizens would henceforth need to apply for visas before traveling to Venezuela. Those moves followed the Obama administration's decision to cancel the visas of 56 Venezuelan officials and some of their relatives, which was meant to punish those suspected of committing human rights abuses and acts of corruption and set an example for others.
While both governments will doubtlessly remain at odds for the foreseeable future, moving closer to a full-scale rupture in relations would harm ordinary Venezuelans who are struggling in an imploding economy, in which inflation is soaring and food shortages are worsening. Venezuela, which exported nearly $26 billion worth of crude oil to the United States last year, has a lot to lose, but Mr. Maduro appears foolish and recalcitrant enough to want to escalate the conflict.
For now, the showdown stands to provide Mr. Maduro with political cover and excuses amid a widening economic crisis that is largely his fault. To shore up his flagging popular support, he accuses the United States of waging an economic war against his country to drive him out of power.
While American sanctions might hurt some Venezuelan officials, it seems unlikely that they would curb abuses by the government and could even embolden Mr. Maduro. A more productive approach might be to increase efforts to persuade Latin American leaders to speak up for democratic principles in Venezuela and further isolate a leader who is becoming a regional pariah.

Delight or Dread as Euro Plummets Against Dollar

Abstract: "People recognize that the dollar is strengthening for the right reasons," Mr. Moutray said, citing the relatively strong United States economy and the signals that the Federal Reserve may be closer to raising interest rates -- a lure to foreign investors and a further spur to the dollar -- even as the European Central Bank is keeping interest rates at historical lows.

Full text:   PARIS -- For Hervé Montjotin, chief executive of the French trucking and logistics group Norbert Dentressangle, the euro's steep plunge against the dollar could not be more welcome.
In the months since his company bought Jacobson, an American contract logistics company, the currency's decline -- down about 23 percent over the past year -- has meant a windfall when dollars earned in the United States are translated back into euros.
"We bought a profitable business, and that business now makes 20 percent more in euros than when we got it," he said. "We've either been very skilled or very lucky."
Millions of businesspeople on both sides of the Atlantic, as well as tourists planning trips in one direction or the other, are now watching with delight or dread as Europe's main currency drops ever closer to parity with the dollar.
On Wednesday afternoon in Paris, the euro was trading at $1.0567. The currency has declined nearly 13 percent in the first months of 2015 alone and is at its lowest level since early 2003. The euro peaked at almost $1.60 in April 2008, as the European Central Bank was warning of impending interest rate increases despite the financial crisis that was beginning to be felt in the United States.
The current plunge reflects differences in economic outlook, interest rates and monetary policies in Europe and the United States that in many ways favor the Americans -- unless they are American companies trying to sell their wares to Europeans.
For the United States, which already runs a substantial trade deficit with the rest of the world, a weaker euro might only widen that gap, as German cars, Spanish wines and French luxury goods become more price-competitive. Chad Moutray, chief economist for the National Association of Manufacturers in Washington, warned that the strong dollar was "a major headwind" for American companies and said that executives were "less happy" than they were a few months ago.
"People recognize that the dollar is strengthening for the right reasons," Mr. Moutray said, citing the relatively strong United States economy and the signals that the Federal Reserve may be closer to raising interest rates -- a lure to foreign investors and a further spur to the dollar -- even as the European Central Bank is keeping interest rates at historical lows. Still, he added, "the dollar is getting to a level where it's harder to compete against the Europeans."
The happier Americans would be tourists, who during the coming spring break or summer months will find that a meal in a fancy French restaurant or a Mediterranean beach holiday costs much less than it would have a year ago. Europeans visiting New York or California, of course, will find that their euros won't stretch nearly as far this year.
The sagging euro is only part of the story. The dollar is on its biggest surge since the mid-1990s -- up 19 percent over the past 12 months against a basket of global currencies that includes the Japanese yen and the British pound.
But the euro is the standout. And it has further room to fall, in many analysts' view. "The market is starting to get parity in its sights," Lee Hardman, a currency economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ in London, said, estimating that a one-to-one exchange rate could be reached within weeks. "The momentum is clearly for a weaker euro."
Part of the euro's downturn stems from the existential questions that continue to dog the currency bloc, as dramatized by Greece's continuing struggle with its creditors over revised bailout terms.
The bigger factor, though, is the impact of the European Central Bank's program, which began this week, to buy [euro]1.1 trillion in bonds by September 2016, while also holding its official interest rates at low, or in some cases even negative, levels. Those policies are meant to stoke the economy, but they are prompting global investors to seek better places to get a return on their money -- like dollar-based stocks and bonds.
Even before the central bank's bond-buying began, investor anticipation was pushing European interest rates to new lows. On Wednesday, the yield on 10-year German government bonds was about 0.23 percent -- while the comparable United States Treasury bill was yielding about 2.00 percent.
That is the largest such gap, or "spread," since 1989, according to Marc Chandler, global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman. And it has unleashed a tsunami of capital flows from Europe to the United States. That trend seems likely to continue for now, whether or not the euro reaches parity with the dollar.
"Parity is a nice psychological thing, but it has no real meaning," Mr. Chandler said. "Before it's over I think we'll test the euro's historic lows." That would be around 82 United States cents, he said, a level last hit in October 2000, when American interest rates were significantly higher than in Europe.
The euro could hit a new trough next year, he said, noting that although the European Central Bank's easy money policy was set to run through at least early autumn 2016, by that time the Federal Reserve might have raised its main interest rate target above 1 percent -- up from near zero currently.
That could mean continued struggles for American exporters.
A Duke/CFO Magazine survey of United States companies published on Wednesday found that around two-thirds of the big American exporters polled reported a negative impact from the strong dollar.
"We are in a midst of an ugly contest to see whether the eurozone, Japan or Canada can depreciate the most against the U.S. dollar, and China is probably next," Campbell R. Harvey, a Fuqua School of Business professor, said in a statement accompanying the survey. "U.S. exporters are being punished by these competitive depreciations, and this will lead to lower profits and less employment."
If the strong dollar does continue to pose those sorts of economic threats, of course, the Fed might alter its thinking about when to raise interest rates. So far, Janet L. Yellen, the Fed chairwoman, has said that she sees factors like the strong dollar and weak oil price to be largely balanced.
But for the struggling eurozone, where unemployment is still averaging above 11 percent and where economies have stalled in most of the currency union's 19 member countries, there is much to recommend a weaker euro.
Speaking in Frankfurt on Wednesday, Mario Draghi, the European Central Bank president, credited the falling currency, along with lower oil prices and the central bank's own policies, with having recently lifted the outlook for economic growth in the bloc. A weak euro also helps the central bank in its battle to rekindle inflation from its worrisome lows, since it raises the prices of imported goods.
Mr. Montjotin, the Norbert Dentressangle chief, noted that the weak euro was also helping his business by making companies in France, Spain and Italy more competitive globally and thus raising demand for his company's services.
He acknowledged some drawbacks. The company's American debt is now 20 percent heavier in euro terms, he noted. And as the euro falls, it negates part of the positive impact of the lower price of oil, which is priced in dollars.
"On balance, though," Mr. Montjotin concluded, "it is positive."

Full text:   Higher art prices and a greater number of transactions pushed global art market sales up 7 percent last year to 51.2 billion euros (about $68 billion at an average exchange rate for the year), according to the annual report for the European Fine Art Foundation, published Wednesday.
This figure, unadjusted for inflation, was higher than the previous market peak in 2007, the report said. The volume of sales also increased, by 6 percent, but the number of transactions remained below the 2007 peak. The market continued to be dominated by three main regions, the United States, China and Britain. Clare McAndrew, the author of the report, said the postwar and contemporary sector continued to be the most popular in terms of value.

Abstract: Petrobras, which has relied on global bond markets to finance its ambitious investment plans, is now retrenching -- a bad omen for Brazil's investment-starved economy, which is not expect to grow this year. [...]in Turkey, the country's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has added to existing currency jitters by suggesting that the head of the Turkish central bank is beholden to foreign speculators because he has not lowered interest rates fast enough. According to the Institute of International Finance, the trade group for global banks, global flows into emerging markets nearly halved last month, to $12 billion from $23 billion, with money flowing out of Brazil, Ukraine and Thailand and into Indonesia and India. Since the beginning of the year, investors in the world's largest emerging-markets investment vehicle, the $38 billion Oppenheimer developing markets fund, have withdrawn just $400 million -- an amount by no means indicative of investor panic.

Full text:   In Russia, it's assassinations and war. In Brazil, a corruption scandal may derail the economy. And in Turkey, the president is attacking the country's senior central banker.
Emerging markets, not long ago seen as a necessary ingredient for the common portfolio, have lately taken on a more toxic quality as messy politics and staggering economies are prompting some investors to reassess their investment rationale.
Compounding these concerns has been the dollar's upward march and the growing acceptance that the Federal Reserve will soon increase interest rates as the United States economy outpaces the rest of the world's.
Emerging-market currencies, an accurate barometer of investor mood swings, are now suffering the consequences. The Turkish lira and the Brazilian real have touched multiyear lows against the dollar while the Russian ruble remains volatile after its 65 percent plunge.
Even the currencies of economies seen to be in better shape, like the Mexican peso, which is trading at record lows against the dollar, and the Indian rupee are under pressure.
"You are seeing all the bad things about emerging markets that originally made them sub-investment grade," said Daniel Tenengauzer, an emerging-market specialist at the Royal Bank of Canada. "The whole thesis that emerging markets are emerging is being questioned right now."
Mr. Tenengauzer points to Brazil as the main culprit. Allegations of kickbacks and bribes at Petrobras, the country's energy giant, threaten to engulf the country's business and economic elites. Petrobras, which has relied on global bond markets to finance its ambitious investment plans, is now retrenching -- a bad omen for Brazil's investment-starved economy, which is not expect to grow this year.
But the outlook is no better in Russia, where a war with Ukraine and President Vladimir V. Putin's erratic ways -- combined with a collapse in the price of oil -- have rattled investors. And in Turkey, the country's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has added to existing currency jitters by suggesting that the head of the Turkish central bank is beholden to foreign speculators because he has not lowered interest rates fast enough.
Beyond these surface problems are deeper vulnerabilities in these and other emerging markets that, analysts say, will become more acute as the dollar continues to race ahead.
In a report published last week, Mr. Tenengauzer highlighted how, in the last five years of extraordinary central bank easing, emerging markets have taken on more debt as developed markets have done the opposite.
This dollar-based leveraging up has been led by capital-hungry companies that cashed in on a broad investor desire for high-yielding bonds. Chinese short-term debt has exploded to $850 billion from $101 billion since 2008; in Brazil, the increase was to $112 billion from $47 billion, and Turkey's near-term liabilities jumped to $95 billion from $56 billion.
When their currencies were strong and the dollar weak, such a strategy made sense. But when the reverse is true, foreign investors take their money elsewhere, and these dollar debts become harder to pay off.
Of course, it is a mistake to treat emerging-market problems as uniform. For example, while Brazil and Russia suffered last year, stocks and bonds soared in India under a new reform-minded government. Indonesia, Taiwan and the Philippines also attracted investor interest because of their successful economic policies.
And while currencies have been volatile, capital flows out of emerging markets, although weaker of late, have not yet approached the levels of a year ago.
According to the Institute of International Finance, the trade group for global banks, global flows into emerging markets nearly halved last month, to $12 billion from $23 billion, with money flowing out of Brazil, Ukraine and Thailand and into Indonesia and India.
Since the beginning of the year, investors in the world's largest emerging-markets investment vehicle, the $38 billion Oppenheimer developing markets fund, have withdrawn just $400 million -- an amount by no means indicative of investor panic.
Still, emerging-market experts say that the fact that the dollar is on a tear and that interest rates in the United States are moving up will entice investors to hunt for juicy returns in the United States as opposed to Brazil and Turkey.
"The U.S. is becoming a high-yielding country," said Jeffrey Sherman, a bond investor at Doubleline, a mutual fund company based in Los Angeles.
Further cementing the United States' appeal is rising doubt about senior-level decision making in some of the developing countries.
In Turkey, for example, Mr. Erdogan has been pressuring his central bank, which is nominally independent, to bring interest rates down even though inflation remains high and the lira shaky.
Standard economic theory has it that higher interest rates quell inflation and support the currency.
"This is a vulnerable period," said Michael Harris, a Turkey specialist at Renaissance Capital in London. "The market assumes that Turkey is one of the big victims of Fed tightening, so we need a spell now when politicians don't throw more fuel on the fire."
In Brazil, the Petrobras scandal has added to longstanding fears that the country became too reliant on the commodity boom of the previous decade and gorged on debt.
Now, with Petrobras debt being recently downgraded to junk status, investors fear that a downgrade of the country's government bonds could follow.
So far this year, the Brazilian real has lost 15 percent and the Turkish lira has lost 12 percent against the dollar, making them the worst-performing currencies among major developing markets.
Brazil and Turkey have taken steps to reassure investors.
Late last year, President Dilma Rousseff of Brazil, under fire for her ties to Petrobras, appointed a new market-friendly finance minister, Joaquim Levy, to oversee Brazil's cost-cutting drive.
And last week, a weighty delegation of Turkish politicians, headlined by Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu and the country's finance minister, swept into New York to meet with anxious fund managers.
But as long as turmoil and scandal persist, such measures, while helpful, run the risk of being too little too late.
Mr. Tenengauzer, the emerging-market expert, said he had been barraged by phone calls from investors about the chaos in these markets. "It's really affecting the asset class."

Full text:   Some Republicans in Congress are calling for cuts to the Census Bureau's budget that would impair the agency's already strained ability to gather basic data.
An accurate census is essential to determining the correct number of representatives from each state, the effectiveness of voting laws and the allotment of federal aid to states. In fact, information from the census and other surveys by the bureau is crucial to anyone -- policy makers and businesspeople, researchers and citizens -- who wants to understand the United States, assess where it is headed and influence its course on the basis of hard data.
The White House has requested a slim $1.5 billion for the bureau for fiscal year 2016. Much of that would be for the 2020 census, the planning of which is already behind schedule because of previous budget cuts. Next year is critical for the testing of data-gathering technology; Congress's failure to provide timely financing to try out hand-held computers before the 2010 census forced a last-minute reversion to paper forms, which proved costlier than an orderly roll out of the computers would have been.
Congress looks set to make the same mistake again. At a recent hearing on the census budget, the Republican leader of the House appropriations subcommittee, John Culberson, indicated that spending on the 2020 census should be less than the total for the 2010 census. That makes no sense. In addition to upfront costs for technology, an adequate budget has to account for 10 years of inflation and population growth.
Mr. Culberson also criticized as overly intrusive the bureau's American Community Survey, the nation's most important source of socioeconomic data. Begun at Congress's urging in 2005, the community survey is a long poll that goes to a few hundred thousand households monthly. It allows the bureau to keep the decennial questionnaire short and still ensure accuracy through follow-up surveys. President Obama wants $257 million of the 2016 census budget to go toward the community survey, which is not even enough to make up for recent budget cuts that will force the bureau to release less American Community Survey data. But it is apparently too much for Republicans.
A threat to timely and accurate census data is a threat to fact-based debate and data-driven policy making. The census budget is small in terms of federal spending, but the White House should wage a big fight for it.

Full text:   FRANKFURT -- The European Central Bank began its long-awaited bond-buying program on Monday, an unprecedented 1.1 trillion euro bid to help revive the eurozone economy.
Despite predictions that the central bank would have trouble finding enough government bonds to buy, officials in Frankfurt said they were not encountering any problems -- at least on the first day of purchases.
Initial market reaction was muted, reflecting the lengthy buildup to the so-called quantitative easing program, which by design eliminated any element of surprise.
European stock markets slipped slightly for the day, while the euro rose initially against the dollar before retreating to about $1.085. The effective interest rate or yield on German 10-year bonds fell to 0.31 percent from 0.39 percent, though it was not clear if the central bank's buying was the main reason. Bond yields fall as prices rise.
The central bank's president, Mario Draghi, announced the starting date of the asset purchases at the central bank's meeting last week. Monday morning, the European Central Bank confirmed on Twitter that the program had begun.
"E.C.B. and eurosystem national central banks have, as previously announced, started purchases under the Public Sector Purchase Program," the central bank said on Twitter.
The eurosystem refers to the network of eurozone national central banks, which are doing most of the purchasing on bond markets. Typically they are buying the bonds from large banks that act as dealers.
The goal of the program is to drive up inflation, which has slipped into negative territory and has raised the specter of deflation, a broad decline in consumer prices that can eventually undercut corporate revenue and force companies to cut staff.
Central banks in the United States, Britain and Japan have used quantitative easing, but it had never been tried in the eurozone until Monday.
The European Central Bank has said bonds will be purchased on the open market -- not directly from bond issuers, in part to avoid accusations that it is violating a ban on central bank financing of eurozone governments. And it will wait several days before buying newly issued bonds to give financial markets time to determine a price.
But one side effect of the program could be to relieve pressure on government budgets. Most of the purchases are being conducted by national central banks, which will buy their own governments' bonds and collect interest payments and other profits.
Later, the central banks will pass the profits back to their national governments. That means the debt effectively becomes free of cost to the issuing country.
One unresolved issue is how to deal with any losses suffered in countries like Germany, where many government bonds with maturities of seven years or less carry negative interest rates and thus will return less money than they cost. Opposition to the bond-buying program remains fierce in Germany.
"The bond purchase program will make the problems in Europe even worse," Lüder Gerken, director of the Center for European Policy in Freiburg, Germany, said in a statement. "By lowering interest rates on government bonds the E.C.B. will further remove reform pressure on member states. At the same time the flood of money will lead to false allocation of capital and strongly raise the risk of bubbles."
The European Central Bank aims to buy [euro]60 billion ($65 billion) in government bonds and other assets each month, spread out evenly over the month. The purchases will continue until September 2016, or until the bank's Governing Council is confident that inflation is heading back toward the official target of below, but close to, 2 percent.
Much of the effect of the central bank's policies was already reflected in the rising prices of stocks and bonds. The central bank said in January that it would begin buying government bonds, and it had signaled well before then that quantitative easing was imminent.
Benoît Coeuré, a member of the central bank's executive board, said in an interview on Sunday with Politis, a newspaper in Cyprus, that the asset-purchase program had already had a positive effect on the eurozone economy, by pushing down the cost of credit.
"Lending rates to households and firms have come down since the summer across the entire euro area," Mr. Coeuré said in the interview.
The purchases are being made roughly in proportion to the economic weight of each of the 19 countries in the eurozone.
In addition to bonds issued by governments, the European Central Bank and national central banks will also buy debt issued by government institutions such as the European Stability Mechanism, the eurozone bailout fund, and the Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau, a German development bank.
The European Central Bank said it would disclose details of the bond purchases on a weekly basis.

Full text:   CARACAS, Venezuela -- He thunders about conspiracies and assassination plots. He says that he sleeps with both eyes open. Few Venezuelans even know where he lives.
But no matter the dangers, President Nicolás Maduro says that no one will scare him, fool him or divert him from carrying out the mission that the "eternal Commander Chávez" has given him "until the end of the end of the roads, now and forever."
Mr. Maduro came into office seeking to imitate his charismatic predecessor and mentor, Hugo Chávez, in nearly every way: the way he talked, the way he dressed and in his fulminations against American imperialism.
But now, two years after the death of Mr. Chávez, with his country sinking deeper into an economic crisis, what was once Mr. Maduro's greatest advantage -- his absolute loyalty to the former leader -- may have become his greatest handicap.
"The government inaction, the inertia, comes from a belief that you find in Nicolás Maduro and his government about defending Chávez's legacy, as if nothing that Chávez left can be touched, nothing can be changed or corrected because that would be considered a betrayal," said Victor Álvarez, a leftist economist and former government minister under Mr. Chávez.
Well before Mr. Chávez's death on March 5, 2013, it became clear that many of his policies needed to be revised or even discarded to set the nation's economy on the right track, Mr. Álvarez said.
But wary of breaking from his mentor's course, Mr. Maduro, who repeats Mr. Chávez's name like a mantra and calls himself the son of Chávez, has doubled down on the same policies, which economists say have contributed to a storm of economic problems, including recession, soaring inflation and chronic shortages of basic goods.
"Maduro has a tragic destiny," said Alberto Barrera, a newspaper columnist and novelist. He argued that Mr. Maduro has to blame the United States and other enemies for the country's problems because to do otherwise would recognize that Mr. Chávez's legacy is flawed.
"Maduro knows that he has to confront a very big crisis, but to accept and recognize the crisis is to recognize that Chávez and the revolution failed," Mr. Barrera added.
While Mr. Maduro sticks to Mr. Chávez's legacy in economic matters -- including price controls and government ownership of major companies that have stagnated and been mismanaged -- many Venezuelans argue that he may have surpassed Mr. Chávez in one area: his attacks on the political opposition.
After dispatching troops during protests last year, Mr. Maduro has jailed a succession of prominent politicians. Last month, the intelligence police raided the office of Antonio Ledezma, the mayor of Caracas, and hauled him off to jail. He has been accused of taking part in one of the many coup plots Mr. Maduro has alleged.
Mr. Ledezma now sits in the Ramo Verde military prison, along with Leopoldo López, the leader of a political party who championed last year's protests, and Daniel Ceballos, a former mayor. Another former opposition mayor, Enzo Scarano, was recently released.
Mr. Chávez also sought regularly to intimidate the opposition, and he drove some opposing politicians into exile with threats to have them arrested. But opposition leaders say that being politically active is much riskier today.
"Maduro's problem is that he does not project leadership, so he has to make up for it by trying to look strong," said Stalin González, an opposition legislator. "People laugh at him; they don't take him seriously. It's like a bully at school. They laugh at him, and he resorts to violence so that they will respect him."
Mr. Maduro, a civilian with no military background, has loaded his government with military officers to a greater extent than Mr. Chávez, a former paratrooper who celebrated the trappings of military life.
The ministers of finance, the interior and food and Mr. Maduro's chief of staff are military officers, as are a number of other cabinet members.
"The ministerial positions that manage the greatest economic resources are in the hands of military officers," said Rocío San Miguel, president of Control Ciudadan o, a group that monitors the military. She said that more than a quarter of government ministers were now current or former military officers, compared with one in five near the end of Mr. Chávez's presidency.
Mr. Maduro has also lavished perks on the military, giving the armed forces their own television station, a bank and other prizes.
That has raised questions of whether Mr. Maduro has drawn the military close to build alliances, whether he is a captive of interests beyond his control, or both.
Mr. Maduro was handpicked by Mr. Chávez, who was sick with cancer, to succeed him, and Mr. Maduro won a presidential election by a narrow margin in 2013.
Yet to many he still seems stuck in Mr. Chávez's shadow. Even his backers describe him in relation to his mentor.
"He learned from Chávez to look at reality straight on and attack it as it is," said Roy Daza, a member of Mr. Maduro's United Socialist Party in the Latin American Parliament, a regional body.
Critics say that attack typically focuses on the symptoms, not the roots, of longstanding problems. Faced with huge lines and shortages of basic items like corn flour or sugar, Mr. Maduro has jailed retail executives while steadfastly maintaining the price controls that many economists say cause the problem.
"Instead of attacking the structural causes that create these problems, they are attacking the consequences," Mr. Álvarez, the former minister under Mr. Chávez, said of Mr. Maduro's government.
Mr. Maduro has shown a talent for juggling internal pressures and factions within the movement left behind by Mr. Chávez, sidelining some rivals and accommodating others.
He pushed Jorge Giordani, a close adviser to Mr. Chávez, out of government and then suppressed a mini-revolt by Mr. Giordani's supporters in his party's left wing. And he has marginalized Rafael Ramírez, the powerful former head of the government oil company, PDVSA, removing him from that post and other crucial positions before finally packing him off as ambassador to the United Nations.
But Diosdado Cabello, the president of the National Assembly and a former military officer, is considered Mr. Maduro's main rival for power and also the government figure with the greatest influence within the armed forces.
All that has led to a kind of Kremlinology here, with observers speculating on who is behind government actions and whether Mr. Maduro is fully in control.
"There is a lot of internal division. Does Diosdado have more power than Maduro, does someone else?" said Daniel Cuevas, a government worker who voted for Mr. Maduro but is unhappy with the country's direction. "In the end, that hurts the people."
Despite his tough talk, Mr. Maduro has also earned a reputation for Hamlet-like indecisiveness. He has spoken for over a year about raising gasoline prices, the world's lowest, but has taken no action. A long-promised foreign exchange reform last month turned out to be a tweak.
"He is an enigma for Venezuelans," said Mr. Barrera, the columnist, pointing to the mystery around Mr. Maduro's residence as a metaphor for his presidency.
The official presidential mansion, known as La Casona, is still occupied by one of Mr. Chávez's daughters, Rosa Virginia, and her husband, Vice President Jorge Arreaza. Mr. Maduro has said the house is for the use of the late president's family, for their protection.
"He hasn't even moved into the house that corresponds to him" as president, Mr. Barrera said. "He says that he is going to stand up to the gringos, but he hasn't even been able to stand up to Chávez's daughter so that he can occupy the presidential mansion."
A government official, who spoke on the condition that he not be identified, said that Mr. Maduro lives in a residence inside a Caracas military base, Fort Tiuna.
Mr. Maduro spends many hours each week on television denouncing his enemies inside and outside the country, including opposition politicians and the United States, in the style of Mr. Chávez. Last month, he ordered the American Embassy to sharply cut its staff.
On the air, he describes himself as the victim of international machinations. The evidence he offers is often colorful but far from convincing to many Venezuelans, including many supporters. He rarely appears in public without his wife, Cilia Flores, a former legislator whom he calls the First Combatant.
At 52, his thick brush of hair and mustache often appear jet black, as if painted on, barely showing signs of gray. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. was quoted as commenting on Mr. Maduro's lustrous hair when the two met recently in Brazil during President Dilma Rousseff's inauguration, saying, "If I had your hair, I'd be president of the United States."
Recently, Mr. Maduro has focused on President Obama, sometimes pretending to speak directly to him during his speeches. He often describes Mr. Obama as a decent man unaware of the sinister forces in his government intent on attacking Venezuela.
But in a recent speech, Mr. Maduro sounded hurt that Mr. Obama had not returned the attention.
"I regret very much, Mr. Obama, that you have let yourself be led down a dead-end street," he said. "I regret that in a year in which I made public appeals to you, I sent you a letter, I sent you emissaries, you have, in an arrogant way, refused to speak to me. I'm as much a president as you are."

Full text:   Six years ago, Paul Ryan, who has since become the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee and the G.O.P.'s leading voice on matters economic, had an Op-Ed article published in The Times. Under the headline "Thirty Years Later, a Return to Stagflation," he warned that the efforts of the Obama administration and the Federal Reserve to fight the effects of financial crisis would bring back the woes of the 1970s, with both inflation and unemployment high.
True, not all Republicans agreed with his assessment. Many asserted that we were heading for Weimar-style hyperinflation instead.
Needless to say, those warnings proved totally wrong. Soaring inflation never materialized. Job creation was sluggish at first, but more recently has accelerated dramatically. Far from seeing a rerun of that '70s show, what we're now looking at is an economy that in important respects resembles that of the 1990s.
To be sure, there are big differences between America in 2015 and America in the '90s. TV is much better now, the situation of workers much worse. While stocks are high and there is talk of a new technology bubble, there's nothing like the old euphoria. There is also, unfortunately, no sign that the great productivity surge of 1995-2005, brought on as businesses adopted information technology, is coming back.
Still, we're now adding jobs at a rate not seen since the Clinton years. And it goes without saying that low inflation combined with rapid job growth makes nonsense of all those predictions that Obamacare, or maybe just the president's bad attitude, would destroy the private sector.
But pointing out yet again just how wrong the usual suspects on the right have been about, well, everything isn't the only reason to note parallels with the 1990s. There are also implications for monetary policy: Recent job gains have brought the Fed to a fork in the road very much like the situation it faced circa 1995. Now, as then, job growth has taken the official unemployment rate down to a level at which, according to conventional wisdom, the economy should be overheating and inflation should be rising. But now, as then, there is no sign of the predicted inflation in the actual data.
The Fed has a so-called dual mandate -- it's supposed to achieve both price stability and full employment. At this point price stability is conventionally taken to mean low but positive inflation, at around 2 percent a year. What does it mean to achieve full employment? For the Fed, it means reaching the Nairu -- the nonaccelerating inflation rate of unemployment, which is consistent with that inflation target.
The Fed currently estimates the Nairu at between 5.2 percent and 5.5 percent, and the latest report puts the actual unemployment rate at 5.5 percent. So we're there -- time to raise interest rates!
Or maybe not. The Nairu is supposed to be the unemployment rate at which the economy overheats and an inflationary spiral starts to kick in. But there is no sign of inflationary pressure. In particular, if the job market really were tight, wages would be rising quickly, whereas they are in fact going nowhere.
The thing is, we've been here before. In the early-to-mid 1990s, the Fed generally estimated the Nairu as being between 5.5 percent and 6 percent, and by 1995, unemployment had already fallen to that level. But inflation wasn't actually rising. So Fed officials made what turned out to be a very good choice: They held their fire, waiting for clear signs of inflationary pressure. And it turned out that the United States' economy was capable of generating millions more jobs, without inflation, than it would have if the Fed had reined in the boom too soon.
Are we in a similar situation now? Actually, I don't know -- but neither does the Fed. The question, then, is what to do in the face of that uncertainty, with no inflation problem yet in sight.
To me, as to a number of economists -- perhaps most notably Lawrence Summers, the former Treasury secretary -- the answer seems painfully obvious: Don't yank away that punch bowl, don't pull that rate-hike trigger, until you see the whites of inflation's eyes. If it turns out that the Fed has waited a bit too long, inflation might overshoot 2 percent for a while, but that wouldn't be a great tragedy. But if the Fed moves too soon, we might end up losing millions of jobs we could have had -- and in the worst case, we might end up sliding into a Japanese-style deflationary trap, which has already happened in Sweden and possibly in the eurozone.
What's worrisome is that it's not clear whether Fed officials see it that way. They need to heed the lessons of history -- and the relevant history here is the 1990s, not the 1970s. Let's party like it's 1995; let the good, or at least better, times keep rolling, and hold off on those rate hikes.

Full text:   Something unusual is happening to prices right now: They are falling.
The recent sharp decline in gas prices is part of the story, but there is now growing fear that the Federal Reserve will undershoot its own 2 percent inflation target, hindering the economic recovery. There's also a small but worrying risk that the economy could enter a deflationary rut.
At issue are inflation expectations. Economists believe expectations are critical because they shape the decisions individual shopkeepers make when deciding whether and by how much to raise their prices. Beliefs about inflation create a self-fulfilling prophecy in which today's expected inflation becomes tomorrow's actual inflation. The trick to managing inflation then, is to manage inflation expectations. In practice, though, it is very hard to observe what people expect inflation to be.
That's why it's worth paying close attention to the disturbing portents from a relatively young and obscure derivatives market that provides new perspectives on inflation expectations -- tracking not only the likely level of inflation, but also the risks that inflation might be too high, too low or just right. In this market, derivatives called inflation caps and inflation floors are, effectively, bets on the trajectory of prices over the next few years.
Think of it as a prediction market for inflation. Just as prediction markets are better than experts, computer models or surveys at forecasting elections, sporting events and the weather, it seems likely that these markets are better at capturing inflation expectations.
The math involved is tricky, but recent research by Yuriy Kitsul, a Fed economist, and Jonathan Wright, a professor of economics at Johns Hopkins University, provides a useful guide.
For example, the two economists show that by buying and selling various derivatives you can form a portfolio expected to pay $100 if the average rate of inflation over the next five years is between 1.5 and 2.5 percent. At the moment, this bet sells for $49. If traders are betting to maximize their expected profits (more on this in a moment), then this price will rise or fall until it reflects the probability of that level of inflation. The $49 price suggests the market believes there's slightly less than a 50-50 chance that the Fed will deliver an outcome that is roughly consistent with its stated inflation target of 2 percent.
While traders view inflation of roughly 2 percent as the most likely outcome, the market is also telling us the probability of other levels of inflation -- or deflation. And it is saying that the risks of missing the 2 percent target are extremely unbalanced: It is twice as likely that inflation will come in below the Fed's target as above it.
Moreover, for a technical reason, these odds most likely understate the probability that the Fed will undershoot its inflation target. (That's because the derivatives are bets on the future of the Consumer Price Index, while the Fed's goal is tied to a different index, for personal consumption expenditures, and it tends to grow a few tenths of a percentage point slower.)
The implication is that the market perceives the Fed as likely to be too hawkish over coming years, perhaps because the central bank will raise interest rates earlier or higher than is necessary to hit its 2 percent inflation target.
The prediction market also highlights the risks of the type of really awful outcomes that keep economists up at night.
Consider the threat of deflation, in which prices fall over an extended period, often hand in hand with economic stagnation. The market currently gives a 6 to 7 percent chance that prices will either be flat or will fall over the next five years. This sort of prolonged deflationary slump -- similar to one Japan has experienced -- would probably spell bad news for the United States. While the market is not saying this outcome is likely -- indeed, it has revised down the odds a bit in recent weeks -- it does suggest it is worth worrying about.
Of course, the specific probabilities inferred from market prices should be taken with many grains of salt. In particular, traders may not be betting that prolonged deflation is probable, but rather be buying insurance against such a grim occurrence. Thus, prediction market prices might overstate the probability of bad outcomes. Nonetheless, these prices embed a powerful message for policy makers: Just as people buy flood insurance when they're concerned that a storm might do terrible damage, traders might be buying deflation insurance because they fear the risk of vast economic damage if the economy were to enter a deflationary rut.
A common concern voiced by the Fed's hard-money critics is that the central bank has already increased the money supply so much that it will lose control of inflation as the economy recovers. The market does not give much stock to these concerns, however, suggesting that there's only a 1 percent chance that inflation will average 5 percent or more over the next five years. Next time people tell you that higher inflation is coming, remind them that they can get rich in the derivatives markets if they're willing to put their money where their mouth is.
For several years now, these markets -- as well as related inflation-indexed bonds and inflation swaps -- have been a source of comfort for policy makers, as they reported that inflation expectations were roughly consistent with the Fed's inflation target. But over the last half-year, the markets have sounded a largely unheralded alert siren, reporting that expected inflation has fallen sharply. Inflation is now expected to run half a point or more below target for many years.
To some extent, this decline in inflation expectations reflects a vote of confidence in the Fed, as earlier fears of high inflation have come to be seen as an increasingly distant possibility. But it also reflects fears of Fed timidity, as the risk of prolonged deflation remains high.
By this measure, the Fed has been halfway successful at establishing its credibility, successfully bolstering its inflation-fighting bona fides, but failing to instill sufficient confidence that it stands ready to fight the drag of very low inflation or outright deflation.

Abstract: Ignoring these signs of weakness would be foolish, and yet the new report has stirred talk that the Federal Reserve will see the falling jobless rate as a sign of strength that justifies an imminent interest-rate increase.

Full text:   The latest jobs report showed that unemployment fell to 5.5 percent in February and that 295,000 jobs were added to the economy. But the labor market is not as healthy as those figures might suggest.
For example, the latest report shows that unemployment is still elevated for African-Americans, at 10.4 percent, and for Hispanics, at 6.6 percent, compared with 4.7 percent for white workers. In a truly strong job market, those racial gaps would be narrower because the competition for workers would drive joblessness down for minorities, who are the hardest hit in hard times.
Another sign of weakness is stagnant wage growth. In a stronger job market, competition for labor would push up wages as it pulled down unemployment. But wages have barely budged throughout the nearly six-year-old recovery.
Ignoring these signs of weakness would be foolish, and yet the new report has stirred talk that the Federal Reserve will see the falling jobless rate as a sign of strength that justifies an imminent interest-rate increase. That would be a mistake, however, because raising rates in the near term would lock in high unemployment among minorities and wage stagnation.
The goal of monetary policy is to set rates low enough to foster job growth and high enough to control inflation. In the past, the Fed has indicated that an unemployment rate around 5.4 percent would be consistent with holding inflation to a target rate of 2 percent on average. Both the jobless rate and the inflation rate are getting closer to the benchmarks the Fed has set for initiating rate increases. But there are problems with those targets.
The reason the Fed associates falling unemployment with rising inflation is that, theoretically, more hiring leads to higher wages that, in turn, lead to consumer demand for goods and services, pushing up prices.
In practice, it has been several decades since those relationships have held -- in part, because the Fed has usually been too quick to raise rates when wages have started to rise. This has led to a long-term decline in the share of income that goes to worker pay and a long-term increase in the share that goes to stockholders and executives.
The Fed should hold off until wages are growing in tandem with inflation and productivity. In the meantime, it should use its regulatory tools to ensure that low-interest-rate credit is put to productive uses and not speculative bubbles. Of course, Congress should do its part for job creation and economic growth -- say, by financing infrastructure projects. Its inability to act is yet another reason the Fed has to get its response right.

Jobs Report Shows Janet Yellen's Quandary in a Nutshell

Abstract: Some Fed watchers aren't so sure that adds up. [...]we see gains in higher-wage jobs (and the trend has been flat for quite a long time), we won't see upward pressure on wages, and we won't see upward pressure on inflation," Megan Greene, the chief economist of John Hancock Financial Services, said in a note to clients. Ms. Yellen, who studied labor markets in her academic career, has preached the gospel of studying a full range of indicators, some of them relatively obscure, to judge the true health of the job market.

Full text:   The biggest decision that Janet Yellen has faced in her year-old Federal Reserve chairmanship was laid bare in a single report on the domestic job market released Friday.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.5 percent as job creation continued at a strong pace. Joblessness is now within the 5.2 to 5.5 percent range that Fed leaders say reflects a sustainable level over the long run.
For a Fed that has spent the last seven years doing everything it can think of to try to get the job market on track, that translates to: Mission Accomplished. And by traditional central bank thinking, that would mean it's waited long enough to raise interest rates to prevent the economy from overheating.
But by other measures in the same report, overheating is a distant worry. Average hourly earnings rose only 0.1 percent, and have now risen less than 2 percent over the last year -- pretty much what they've been doing for five years straight. The number of people in the labor force actually declined, suggesting that the pool of potential workers who neither have a job nor are looking for one is growing, not shrinking.
All of that points to a job market that still has a great deal of room to run before the Yellen Fed needs to do much of anything.
For a Federal Reserve chairwoman who largely spent her first year implementing policies that had been agreed upon before she took office, this is a major decision point. Which set of signals should she and her colleagues on the Fed's policy-setting board listen to?
The battle of conflicting economic ideas was played out in the financial markets Friday. Reaction there was at odds with the reaction of some of the sharper Fed analysts to the new data. Longer-term interest rates soared Friday morning upon the release of the new data, as did the dollar, indicating that bond and currency traders saw the report as implying the Fed will raise interest rates sooner and higher than it had seemed just before the release.
Based on futures market prices, for example, investors on Thursday had seen a 49 percent chance of a Fed interest rate increase by September. It rose to 59 percent Friday after the new data. That is a clear signal that Wall Street is doing some simple math to conclude that More Jobs + Lower Unemployment = Tighter Monetary Policy.
Some Fed watchers aren't so sure that adds up. "Until we see gains in higher-wage jobs (and the trend has been flat for quite a long time), we won't see upward pressure on wages, and we won't see upward pressure on inflation," Megan Greene, the chief economist of John Hancock Financial Services, said in a note to clients. "I hope this would impact the timing of the Fed's next rate hike. Today's report supports the argument that the Fed should wait until at least the end of this year to start hiking rates."
"The softness in average hourly earnings tempers the case for a June rate hike," wrote Krishna Guha of Evercore ISI. "We view this as a close call but still lean to September."
Ms. Yellen, who studied labor markets in her academic career, has preached the gospel of studying a full range of indicators, some of them relatively obscure, to judge the true health of the job market. And by that measure the February numbers are a more mixed picture than the wariness on Wall Street might suggest.
At the same time, it is the job of Fed officials to make policy based on where the economy is going, not where it has been. The interest rate decisions they make now have their greatest effect many months down the road.
If you went back in time and told Janet Yellen, college professor, circa 2005, that the unemployment rate was 5.5 percent and the economy was adding 300,000 jobs a month, her reaction would probably be simple: It's time to raise interest rates. Excessive inflation will surely result if you don't.
But so much has changed in the last decade. The economy has been so deep in the doldrums for so long, the deflationary forces pulling down prices globally so strong. The Fed has done so much to try to get the job market revving again. Ms. Yellen will be wary of quashing the recovery. Why? The expansion's ability to translate into higher pay for ordinary Americans is not yet established.
That's why she was coy in congressional testimony last week when asked whether the Fed would need to see clear proof of rising wages before raising rates.
"There are perhaps hints, but we've not seen any significant pickup in wage growth," Ms. Yellen said. "But there are a number of different factors that affect the inflation outlook, and we will be considering carefully a range of evidence."
But assuming the next few months of data unfold the way they have been, with strong job growth, falling unemployment and continued disappointments on wages, she and her colleagues face a big decision that will shape how history views both Ms. Yellen and her leadership of the Fed.

Full text:   Hillary Clinton's record is more moderate than the Democratic primary voter today. So it was always likely that she would move left as the primary season approached. It's now becoming clearer how she might do it. She might make a shift from what you might call human capital progressivism to redistributionist progressivism.
For many years, Democratic efforts to reduce inequality and lift middle-class wages were based on the theory that the key is to improve the skills of workers. Expand early education. Make college cheaper. Invest in worker training. Above all, increase the productivity of workers so they can compete.
But a growing number of populist progressives have been arguing that inequality is not mainly about education levels. They argue that trying to lift wages by improving skills is an "evasion." It's "whistling past the graveyard."
The real problem, some of them say, is concentrated political power. The oligarchs have rigged the game so that workers get squeezed. Others say the problem is stagnation. It's not that workers don't have skills; the private economy isn't generating jobs. Or it's about corporate power. Without stronger unions shareholders reap all the gains.
People in this camp point out that inflation-adjusted wages for college grads have been flat for the past 14 years. Education apparently hasn't lifted wages. The implication? Don't focus on education for the bottom 99 percent. Focus on spreading wealth from the top. Don't put human capital first. Put redistribution first.
Over the past few months a stream of Democratic thinkers and politicians, including natural Clinton allies, have moved from the human capital emphasis to the redistributionist emphasis. (It's a matter of emphasis, not strictly either/or.) For Clinton herself, the appeal is obvious. The redistributionist agenda allows her to hit Wall Street and C.E.O.'s -- all the targets that have become progressive bêtes noires.
Unfortunately, this rising theory is wrong on substance and damaging in its effects.
It is true that wages for college grads have been flat this century, and that is troubling. But this is not true of people with post-college degrees, who are doing nicely. Moreover, as Lawrence Katz of Harvard points out, the argument that college doesn't pay is partly a product of a short-time horizon. Since 2000, the real incomes of the top 1 percent have declined slightly. If you limited your view to just those years, you'd conclude that there is no inequality problem, which is clearly not true.
On an individual level, getting more skills is the single best thing you can do to improve your wages. The economic rewards to education are at historic highs. Americans with a four-year college degree make 98 percent more per hour than people without one. The median college-educated worker will make half-a-million dollars more than a high-school-educated worker over a career after accounting for college costs. Research by Raj Chetty of Harvard and others suggests that having a really good teacher for only one year raises a child's cumulative lifetime income by $80,000.
"What I find destructive," says David Autor of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, "is the message that if you don't get into the top 1 percent then you're out of the game. That's deeply, deeply incorrect."
Autor's own research shows that skills differences are four times more important than concentration of wealth in driving inequality. If we could magically confiscate and redistribute the above-average income gains that have gone to the top 1 percent since 1979, that would produce $7,000 more per household per year for the bottom 99 percent. But if we could close the gap so that high-school-educated people had the skills of college-educated people, that would increase household income by $28,000 per year.
Focusing on human capital is not whistling past the graveyard. Worker productivity is the main arena. No redistributionist measure will have the same long-term effect as good early-childhood education and better community colleges, or increasing the share of men capable of joining the labor force.
The redistributionists seem to believe that modern capitalism is fundamentally broken. That growth has permanently stagnated. That productivity should no longer be the focus because it doesn't lead to shared prosperity.
But their view is biased by temporary evidence from the recession. Right now, jobs are being created, wages are showing signs of life. Those who get more skills earn more money. Today's economy has challenges, but the traditional rules still apply. Increasing worker productivity is the key. Increasing incentives to risk and invest is essential. Shifting people into low-productivity government jobs is not the answer.
It's clear why Clinton might want to talk redistribution. On substantive policy grounds, it would be destructive to do so. And, in the general election, voters respond to the uplifting and the unifying, not the combative and divisive.

Abstract: Blue-chip shares in the eurozone ended the day up about 1 percent, while yields on most eurozone governments' bonds fell slightly. Because of low oil prices, inflation is expected to remain low -- or even in negative territory -- until later this year, the central bank said on Thursday.

Full text:   NICOSIA, Cyprus -- The European Central Bank will begin its big new stimulus program on Monday, the bank's president, Mario Draghi, said. He predicted improvements in the economy and in the eurozone's inflation picture as a result of the effort.
The starting date, announced on Thursday, was one of many details the financial markets had been awaiting since the central bank announced in January that it would embark on a program of large-scale asset purchases intended to fix the collapse in consumer prices.
At a news conference in Cyprus, which is still recovering from a severe banking crisis two years ago, Mr. Draghi appeared unruffled by recent political turmoil in the eurozone, provoked by a change in government in Greece. Instead, he offered one of his most optimistic assessments in months of the eurozone economy -- and gave the central bank much of the credit.
"Our monetary policy decisions have worked," Mr. Draghi said. "It's with some certain degree of satisfaction that the governing council has acknowledged this."
Indications that the central bank plans to stick with its policies, and maintain an environment of low interest rates, briefly sent the euro currency below $1.10 for the first time in a dozen years. At the end of the European trading day it was at $1.1012.
Underpinning Mr. Draghi's optimism, economists at the central bank on Thursday raised their forecast for growth this year to 1.5 percent, compared with a forecast in December of 1 percent. They increased their estimate for 2016 to 1.9 percent, up from a previous prediction of 1.5 percent.
Despite the more promising outlook, the staff projections indicated that the central bank would not approach its inflation target of below, but close to, 2 percent until 2017 at the earliest.
"The E.C.B.'s macroeconomic assessment was much more upbeat than in previous months," Carsten Brzeski, an economist at ING Bank, said in a note to clients on Thursday. In fact, Mr. Brzeski added, "today's euphoria was in our view almost a bit overdone."
Mr. Draghi's suddenly sunny forecast may have been calculated. The central bank's policies, or so-called quantitative easing effort, will be more effective if investors, corporate executives and consumers believe in them. Supported by some genuinely positive economic data, like a dip in unemployment, Mr. Draghi appeared to be using the news conference to give a pep talk that would encourage more investment and spending.
Markets fluctuated during the briefing, but stocks and bonds eventually rallied. Blue-chip shares in the eurozone ended the day up about 1 percent, while yields on most eurozone governments' bonds fell slightly.
Because of low oil prices, inflation is expected to remain low -- or even in negative territory -- until later this year, the central bank said on Thursday. But it revised its inflation forecast for 2016 upward, to 1.5 percent, and its 2017 estimate to 1.8 percent.
The central bank, which was meeting in the capital city of Cyprus as part of its custom of convening twice a year away from its Frankfurt headquarters, left its benchmark rate at 0.05 percent. With inflation in negative territory, the central bank is expected to keep the main rate at close to zero indefinitely.
The monetary policy meeting was the first since the central bank said on Jan. 22 that it would begin buying eurozone government bonds and other debt at a monthly rate of 60 billion euros, or about $67 billion, in an effort to push inflation back toward the official target.
Greece, which is seeking new terms with the European Central Bank and other international creditors, was a main topic of discussion, in part because of a large contingent of Greek journalists. Mr. Draghi said that the central bank was willing to step up its assistance to Athens, "provided the conditions are in place."
The caveat indicates that the new left-wing Greek government still has work to do to convince its lenders -- which include the European Commission and the International Monetary Fund -- that it is serious about making the economic changes its lenders are demanding in exchange for extending the country's bailout program by at least four months.
The European Central Bank's lending to Greece right now is 68 percent of the country's gross domestic product -- the highest in the eurozone -- Mr. Draghi said. "In this sense, the E.C.B. is the central bank of Greece," he added.
The central bank's governing council on Thursday decided to raise its emergency lending to Greek commercial banks by [euro]500 million, Mr. Draghi said.
And he indicated that the central bank would consider resuming its policy of letting the Greek banks use their government's bonds as collateral to obtain regular loans from the European Central Bank -- but only when Athens demonstrated its commitment to making the economic changes the international creditors were demanding.
Because Greek government bonds are rated below investment grade, the European Central Bank must grant a waiver to let the banks use them as collateral. The central bank decided in February to rescind its previous waiver, in light of the uncertainties surrounding the election of the new Greek government.
With a note of sarcasm in his voice, Mr. Draghi rebutted suggestions by some analysts that the European Central Bank would not be able to find enough debt to meet its bond-buying goals.
Demand for government bonds issued by Finland, Germany and some other countries is so strong that some of them have negative interest rates. In effect, investors are willing to pay some debtors to keep their money safe.
"Until a month ago, nobody had any doubts that public debt -- sovereign debt -- in the euro area was actually very, very big," Mr. Draghi said. "Now some people worry we won't have enough bonds."
Mr. Draghi said that the European Central Bank would not buy bonds with yields below the interest rate that the central bank pays on commercial bank deposits that it holds, which is currently a negative rate -- minus 0.2 percent. That is approximately the negative rate at which German two-year bonds have been trading.
But the yields of 10-year bonds of eurozone countries all remain in positive territory.
Bond buying is a way for the European Central Bank to effectively print money and inject it into the economy. But confidence in the central bank's ability to rekindle inflation could suffer if the market is so tight that it is unable to meet its goal of buying [euro]60 billion of debt a month.
The policy might already have had a beneficial effect. Market interest rates have been falling in anticipation of the bond-buying campaign. That is making it possible for companies to borrow money more cheaply than ever. What companies save on interest payments they can invest in expansion and hiring.
"We are investing a lot right now," Hakan Samuelsson, chief executive of the Volvo Car Group, said in an interview at the Geneva International Motor Show on Tuesday. "It's an advantage that we have low interest rates."
Sweden, where Volvo is based, is not a member of the eurozone, but it closely tracks its monetary policy with that of the currency bloc, and the Swedish benchmark rate is below zero. Volvo's decision to renew its model line and rebuild market share in the United States was not prompted by low interest rates, Mr. Samuelsson said.
"But," he added, "it's good timing for us."
Mr. Draghi on Thursday rejected criticism that monetary policy was helping only high-income people who own stocks and bonds. The benefits, he said "are being passed in the form of lower borrowing costs in the real economy."
The choice of Cyprus for the central bank meeting was noteworthy because the country continues to suffer from the effects of the collapse of its banks in 2013, and from a rescue plan that forced depositors to shoulder some of its cost.
Many Cypriots are bitter toward the European Central Bank, which they accuse of making the country's problems worse by continuing to keep the banks on life support long after it was clear that they were insolvent. The delay raised the cost of the bank collapse and worsened the economic pain in Cyprus, critics say. Unemployment is 16.1 percent, and residents still face restrictions on transferring money out of the country.
Some residents of Cyprus expressed their dissatisfaction with the central bank's behavior by staging demonstrations on Wednesday and Thursday outside the conference center where Mr. Draghi held the news conference.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.
