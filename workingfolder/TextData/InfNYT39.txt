Full text: CORRECTION APPENDED
BRASILIA -- Two years ago, President Obama energetically reached out in London to shake the hand of Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who was then the president of Brazil. "Here's my man, right here," Mr. Obama said. "I love this guy. He's the most popular politician on earth."
This weekend, in his first trip to South America since taking office, Mr. Obama will encounter a noticeably different style of leader in Dilma Rousseff, Brazil's first female president. But while Mr. Obama openly admired Mr. da Silva's ample political skills, he may find the United States has more to gain from a Brazil led by the no-nonsense Ms. Rousseff, analysts said.
Less than three months into the job, Ms. Rousseff, once thought to be a potential puppet of Mr. da Silva, has swiftly moved out of the shadow of her mentor. In doing so, Ms. Rousseff, his former chief of staff, has shown she is more likely to pursue foreign policy driven by economic goals than by a desire for the kind of global grandeur that Mr. da Silva often sought, potentially mending some fences with the United States.
Mr. Obama's trip comes at a time when Brazil's rising economic clout is forcing the United States to stand up and take notice, not least because China has. Brazil, now the world's seventh largest economy, has become an increasingly important trading partner for the United States, whose exports to the South American country are growing twice as fast as overall exports of American goods and services, the White House said.
After a year of strain between Brazil and the United States -- mostly because of Mr. da Silva's efforts to wade into the contentious standoff between the West and Iran over its nuclear program by seeking to avoid further sanctions when the United States was pushing for them -- Ms. Rousseff seems determined to patch up the relationship.
"Lula seemed intent on proving a point -- don't underestimate Brazil -- at times at the risk of alienating Obama," said Julia E. Sweig, director for Latin American studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. Ms. Rousseff, she added, "can now reap the benefits by forging a more productive relationship with respect, but without the drama."
She said, "For no-drama Obama, that style could produce tangible benefits for both countries."
Mr. Obama is scheduled to land in Brasilia on Saturday, the first stop of a three-country, four-day tour of Latin America. After meeting with Ms. Rousseff here, he plans to tour a recently "pacified" slum in Rio de Janeiro and give a speech there, before traveling to Chile and El Salvador.
The White House has stressed that the trip coincides with Mr. Obama's domestic agenda of promoting integration in the region as a way to stimulate jobs at home. Ms. Sweig said the president was likely to use it to "showcase the democratic stability and growing prosperity of the Americas as a whole at a time when the Middle East is in flux."
Ms. Rousseff's personal story of torture and imprisonment during Brazil's dictatorship has informed a determination to adopt a stronger stance on human rights in Iran and elsewhere than her predecessor did. American officials have welcomed the shift.
She promised during a speech in January commemorating the Holocaust that her government would be a "tireless defender of the values of equality, human dignity and respect for human rights." In Argentina, she met with Mothers and Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo, the women who symbolize the long search for truth about loved ones "disappeared" during Argentina's dictatorship.
Ms. Rousseff has also indicated she wants to improve trade relations with the United States, saying she would reopen bidding on a multibillion-dollar contract to supply fighter jets, giving the American company Boeing a chance to land a deal that, under Mr. da Silva, seemed destined for a French company.
And while she was elected last October with the unbridled support of Mr. da Silva, a former union leader who became one of Brazil's most popular and charismatic presidents, she has refused to negotiate with unions demanding a higher minimum salary increase than she proposed. She has also put forward about $30 billion in budget cuts.
"No one sees her as Lula's protegee any longer," said Amaury de Souza, a political analyst in Rio de Janeiro. "Lula has sort of faded into the background."
Ms. Rousseff, 63, has eschewed press briefings that became almost a daily event under Mr. da Silva. She does not stand for lateness, or distractions like cellphones in meetings. While Mr. da Silva regularly had lunch at home with his wife while in Brasilia, Ms. Rousseff usually has a quick lunch in her office, sometimes inviting a minister to share a sandwich with her, according to advisers.
Her biggest challenge so far has been trying to clean up a messy fiscal situation she inherited from Mr. da Silva. She has recognized a growing inflation threat to Brazil's economy, Latin America's largest, and so far she has shown some willingness to cut back on spending, including for prized programs like Minha Casa, Minha Vida, which provides housing subsidies.
Critics noted this month that Ms. Rousseff announced a 19 percent increase in financial aid under the government's flagship Bolsa Familia welfare program, which has played a critical role in diminishing poverty.
But she defended the increase, saying, "A wealthy nation is a nation without indigence," echoing one of her campaign slogans.
Brazil also faces increasing pressure to hold down its currency, which has been rising largely because of an inflow of foreign capital. Talk last year by the finance minister, Guido Mantega, of a "currency war" that took aim at American monetary policy has continued to simmer since Ms. Rousseff took over.
But under Ms. Rousseff, Brazil has instead hardened its stance on China, its biggest trade partner, calling more loudly for it to raise the value of its currency as cheap imports from China continue to batter Brazil's industrial sector. Those calls echo American demands.
Investors have so far praised Ms. Rousseff, a trained economist, for her handling of the economy.
She "understands the threat to her administration of inflation, she wants to bring interest rates down and she wants to keep foreign capital flowing in, but understands about the appreciation of the currency," said Riordan Roett, director of the Latin American studies program at Johns Hopkins University. "Lula didn't really understand many of these issues."
Under Mr. da Silva, Brazil refused to vote for more United Nations sanctions against Iran, inciting the ire of the State Department, which said Brazil had been duped by Iran into a compromise that would buy it time to continue pursuing a nuclear program.
Beyond saying that she would be tougher on Iran on the human rights front, it remained unclear whether Ms. Rousseff would try to match the indefatigable Mr. da Silva's domestic and international travel schedule, which helped raise Brazil's global profile. Or whether she can come close to matching Mr. da Silva's touch with the people.
For now, she is trying to soften her "Iron Lady" image. Earlier this month, she prepared an omelet alongside a female host of a popular morning television show, discussing life in the presidential palace.
"It's interesting how people expect a certain weakness from women," Ms. Rousseff said. "I kid that I am a strong woman surrounded by sweet men. A woman in a position of power is seen as a little out of her role."
Correction: March 25, 2011, Friday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Friday about President Obama's planned meetings with Brazil's new president, Dilma Rousseff, during his trip to Latin America this past week misstated her trade policy regarding China. Like Mr. Obama, Ms. Rousseff has been pressing China to raise the value of the Chinese currency, not lower it. (A more expensive Chinese currency would make China's goods more expensive in both the United States and Brazil, where manufacturers complain that cheap Chinese imports are hurting them.)

Full text: WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- Producer prices surged in February at their fastest pace in about 18 months, lifted by high food and energy prices, according to a government report on Wednesday that pointed to a buildup in inflation pressures.
In a second report, the government said housing starts declined the most in 27 years in February while building permits dropped to their lowest level on record, a sign that the beleaguered real estate sector has yet to rebound from its deep slump.
The Labor Department said on Tuesday that its seasonally adjusted index for prices paid at the farm and factory gate jumped 1.6 percent, the largest increase since June 2009, after rising 0.8 percent in January.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 0.7 percent increase in producer prices last month. In the 12 months to February, producer prices increased 5.6 percent.
The report came a day after the Federal Reserve said it expected the upward inflation pressure from energy and other commodities to prove transitory but that it would keep a close eye on inflation and inflation expectations.
The increase in wholesale prices last month was broad-based, with energy prices surging 3.3 percent -- the biggest increase since January 2010, after 1.8 percent the previous month. Gasoline prices, which rose 3.7 percent, accounted for over 40 percent of the increase in the energy index. Food prices jumped 3.9 percent, the biggest increase since 1974.
Stripping out volatile food and energy costs, core producer prices rose 0.2 percent last month, matching expectations, and retreating from a 0.5 percent rise in January.
Last month, the core index was lifted by 1.0 percent increase in apparel, which was the biggest rise since 1990, while passenger cars rose 0.6 percent, the Labor Department said.
In the 12 months to February, the core Producer Price Index rose 1.8 percent, in line with expectations. It was the largest increase since August 2009 and followed a 1.6 percent increase in January.
In the housing report, the Commerce Department said that groundbreaking on new construction dropped 22.5 percent in February to an annual rate of 479,000 units. This was just above a record low set in April 2009 and way below the estimates of economists, who had been looking for a smaller drop to 570,000.
January's figure was revised up to 618,000 units from 596,000. But that did not change the tenor of the report, which confirmed that the sector was failing to recover despite interest rates near record lows.
Building permits, a hint of future construction demand, fell to a record low of 517,000 units from a revised 563,000, and were down by about 20 percent from levels seen in February 2010.
One impediment to the sector's recovery is a vast backlog of unsold inventory, while a shaky job market has also made consumers reluctant to embark on any major new financial commitments. A glut of foreclosures, stalled in recent months by revelations of improper loan documentation, is further depressing the market.
The Commerce Department also reported that the country's current-account deficit narrowed in the fourth quarter, snapping five quarters of gains as export growth outweighed increases in imported goods.
The deficit, which measures the flow of goods, services and investments in and out of the United States, shrank to $113.3 billion -- or 3.1 percent of gross domestic product -- in the last quarter of 2010. That was down from a revised third-quarter deficit of $125.5 billion, and the lowest since the first quarter of 2010.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve on Tuesday reiterated that the economy was improving but said it would continue measures to stimulate growth because it remained more concerned about persistent unemployment than the risk of increased inflation.
The central bank affirmed its plans to buy $600 billion in Treasury securities by the end of June, and also left unchanged its two-year-old commitment to hold a benchmark interest rate near zero "for an extended period."
The Fed's policy-making committee voted unanimously to maintain both policies, intended to make money available at lower cost despite concern about the rising price of oil and new worries about the Japanese economy.
"The economic recovery is on a firmer footing, and overall conditions in the labor market appear to be improving gradually," the Fed said in a statement explaining its decision.
The announcement was widely expected, but some investors said they were pleased by the rosier economic outlook. On a day when events in Japan drove most indexes lower, markets regained some ground after the midafternoon announcement.
However, while the statement on Tuesday reflected greater optimism about the economy than the central bank's last communique in January, recovering from a recession is not the same thing as being in good health. Fed officials say they still are not convinced that the economy will continue to grow without federal support.
The Fed said that the unemployment rate remained well above historic norms, and the construction industry -- a pillar of the economy -- was still in the doldrums.
Moreover, the Fed acknowledged that the increased price of oil and other commodities "are currently putting upward pressure on inflation," and the Fed said it was keeping a close eye on that trend. But it said that surge was likely to subside without causing a rise in the prices of a broader range of goods and services.
The Fed has struggled to explain why it is not worried about inflation at a time when consumers are paying more to buy food and fill their gasoline tanks.
The nation's senior economic officials view broader measurements of prices as more reliable predictors of future increases in the price of all goods and services.
The Fed said that inflation remained below the level that it considered normal, about 2 percent a year, and would most likely remain low for the next several years.
When Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, was asked during Congressional testimony earlier this month about the rise in the prices of oil and other commodities, he said, "The most likely outcome is that the recent rise in commodity prices will lead to, at most, a temporary and relatively modest increase in U.S. consumer price inflation."
The combination of concern about the economic recovery and equanimity about inflation is the driving force in the Fed's continued, extraordinary stimulus campaign.
The Fed aims to control the rate that banks charge each other for loans, known as the federal funds target rate. Raising and lowering that rate works like a floodgate controlling how much money flows into the economy. For the last two years, the Fed has removed the gate entirely, holding the interest near zero.
To further stimulate growth, the Fed also embarked on an unprecedented policy of buying vast quantities of securities, which creates reserves that banks can draw to make loans. That effectively increases the amount of money that can flow into the economy.
The central bank has invested more than $2 trillion in buying mortgage and Treasury securities since the start of the financial crisis in 2008. Since November, the Fed has bought securities at a rate of about $75 billion a month.
The current round of purchases is scheduled to end in June, and close watchers of the Fed said Tuesday that the latest statement contained no suggestion that the economy was weak enough to require a continued program of purchases.
"The tone is much less worried about growth being too weak and inflation being too low than it was earlier," said James O'Sullivan, chief economist at the brokerage MF Global. "That seems to signal that there's no need for a third round of asset purchases."
Mr. Bernanke has said that Fed would judge its next steps based on the state of the economy in the coming months. He has specifically said that he wanted to see evidence of a "self-sustaining" recovery in the form of strong increases private sector employment.
"Until we see a sustained period of stronger job creation, we cannot consider the recovery to be truly established," Mr. Bernanke told Congress earlier this month.
Some members of the Fed's policy-making committee have suggested in recent months that the Fed should consider ending the purchases before June, but none have yet broken ranks with Mr. Bernanke.
Kevin M. Warsh, a Fed governor who is a Bush appointee and has said that he would resign at the end of the month, did not attend the meeting.

Abstract: The committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends and stable inflation expectations are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate for an extended period.

Full text: The following is the full text of the statement released Tuesday by the Federal Reserve:
Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January suggests that the economic recovery is on a firmer footing, and overall conditions in the labor market appear to be improving gradually. Household spending and business investment in equipment and software continue to expand. However, investment in nonresidential structures is still weak, and the housing sector continues to be depressed. Commodity prices have risen significantly since the summer, and concerns about global supplies of crude oil have contributed to a sharp run-up in oil prices in recent weeks. Nonetheless, longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable, and measures of underlying inflation have been subdued.
Consistent with its statutory mandate, the committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. Currently, the unemployment rate remains elevated, and measures of underlying inflation continue to be somewhat low, relative to levels that the committee judges to be consistent, over the longer run, with its dual mandate. The recent increases in the prices of energy and other commodities are currently putting upward pressure on inflation. The committee expects these effects to be transitory, but it will pay close attention to the evolution of inflation and inflation expectations. The committee continues to anticipate a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization in a context of price stability.
To promote a stronger pace of economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at levels consistent with its mandate, the committee decided today to continue expanding its holdings of securities as announced in November. In particular, the committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its securities holdings and intends to purchase $600 billion of longer-term Treasury securities by the end of the second quarter of 2011. The committee will regularly review the pace of its securities purchases and the overall size of the asset-purchase program in light of incoming information and will adjust the program as needed to best foster maximum employment and price stability.
The committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends and stable inflation expectations are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate for an extended period.
The committee will continue to monitor the economic outlook and financial developments and will employ its policy tools as necessary to support the economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at levels consistent with its mandate.
Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Ben S. Bernanke, chairman; William C. Dudley, vice chairman; Elizabeth A. Duke; Charles L. Evans; Richard W. Fisher; Narayana Kocherlakota; Charles I. Plosser; Sarah Bloom Raskin; Daniel K. Tarullo; and Janet L. Yellen.

Abstract: Compared with the same period a year ago, bank lending slowed in February, as did the growth in the money supply, as broadly measured by a yardstick known as M2. Besides tightening monetary policy, Mr. Wen said, the government will hold local officials more strictly accountable for curbing housing prices and food prices.

Full text: BEIJING -- Prime Minister Wen Jiabao, answering prescreened questions at an annual news conference, said Monday that China faced daunting challenges of taming inflation and developing a more consumer-based economy, and that the government would allow the nation's currency to appreciate but at a cautious pace in order to protect Chinese jobs and businesses.
In a plodding two-and-a-half-hour news conference at the conclusion of this year's national legislative conference, Mr. Wen said China's grass-roots elections should be expanded to higher levels of government, but stressed that change must occur "step by step," under the control of the Communist Party.
On the delicate topic of the revolts and revolutions that have besieged authoritarian Arab governments in recent months, he said China's record of speedy economic growth and fast-rising living standards made analogies with those countries "not right."
Mr. Wen spoke as the National People's Congress, in a vote whose results were preordained, approved the country's new five-year development plan. Its strategy promises a surge in government spending on domestic security and social programs like medical insurance, but offers little in the way of legal, political or banking reform. One principal goal, the government has said, is to lessen economic dependence on factory exports and build up innovation and domestic consumption.
Mr. Wen described the war on inflation as the government's top priority. Figures released three days earlier showed that consumer prices rose 4.9 percent in February compared with the same month a year before, the latest in a series of indications that China's economy is beginning to overheat.
The prime minister partly blamed international factors for the soaring costs, among them spiking oil prices because of the unrest in the Middle East and North Africa. He also pointed to looser monetary policy in the United States, where the Federal Reserve had expanded monetary supply in recent months -- a policy known as quantitative easing -- in an effort to assist the economy.
But Mr. Wen also said China must continue to "mop up excess liquidity" at home if it is to hold prices in check. China has repeatedly ordered banks to issue less credit to curtail the money supply.
Figures issued Monday suggested that the restrictions could be taking hold. Compared with the same period a year ago, bank lending slowed in February, as did the growth in the money supply, as broadly measured by a yardstick known as M2.
Besides tightening monetary policy, Mr. Wen said, the government will hold local officials more strictly accountable for curbing housing prices and food prices. "Inflation is like a tiger," he said. "Once set free, it will be very difficult to put the tiger back in its cage. We must not take this issue lightly."
Economists have urged China to allow the renminbi to appreciate in value to help curb inflation. But internationally, critics say that China artificially holds down the value of the renminbi against the dollar and other currencies to increase its exports. American officials also argue that this keeps the cost of American goods high and so limits China's imports.
Mr. Wen promised that the increase in the renminbi's value would continue. But he added: "It should be a gradual process because we must bear in mind its impact on Chinese businesses and the employment situation."
He stressed that China's five-year target of a 7 percent annual rise in the gross domestic product should not be considered low, insisting, "it will not be easy for us to achieve." That is a drop, however, from the 7.5 percent goal of the past five years, which was ludicrously low: the economy grew an average of more than 11 percent annually during that period.
Mr. Wen reiterated his position that a lack of political reform could threaten China's economic advances, singling out corruption as the Communist Party's single biggest threat. He praised the development of village and local elections, saying, "If we are to address the people's grievances and meet their wishes, we must create conditions for people to criticize and supervise the government."
But Mr. Wen, who mentioned the need to reform China's political system just once in the annual work report he submitted to the legislature, was no less circumspect at the news conference.
He stressed that any change must take place under the leadership of the Communist Party. "It requires a stable and harmonious social environment, and it needs to be taken forward in an orderly way," he said.

Full text: The British weavers known as the Luddites, who destroyed looms 200 years ago, thought rising unemployment within their ranks was because of machinery. But there's a case that inflation, money supply expansion, budget deficits and trade barriers were equally to blame. Maybe we haven't learned much in two centuries.
The Luddite riot on March 11, 1811, was an attack on wide knitting frames in the Nottinghamshire village of Arnold. The rioters' believed that their livelihoods had been endangered by a dumbing-down of their skilled work by automated looms. The riots spread to Manchester, a main cotton center, late in 1811. Prime Minister Spencer Perceval's government, which had a robust approach to public order, made frame-breaking a capital offense a year later; 17 offenders were eventually executed. After that, Luddite activity gradually faded out.
The economic conditions facing the Luddites bear consideration today. Britain had been off the gold standard since 1797 and consequently suffered considerable inflation, with prices double in 1813 compared with 1793. Real interest rates were historically low. The yield on long-term British government Consols, the nearest equivalent of today's long-dated Treasury bonds, averaged below 5 percent, only 1 percent above the inflation rate. The Bullion Report of 1810, whose drafters included the economist David Ricardo and the monetarist Henry Thornton, specifically blamed excessive credit for inflation. Much of this credit was absorbed by the government, which ran a deficit of about 12 percent of the gross domestic product because of spending on the concurrent Napoleonic wars.
Of course, there were some large differences from today. A wartime trade embargo had cut off many European markets for British textiles. Nevertheless, the overall picture was one of cheap money leading to labor-saving capital investment, while inflation eroded wages and restrictions and excessive government deficits dampened economic activity.
The Luddites have been mocked for attacking the productivity-enhancing machinery that led to unprecedented improvements in living standards. But given the economic policies of the time -- which bear an uncomfortable resemblance to some of our own -- the Luddites were justified in believing that only higher unemployment, with no discernible improvement in conditions on the horizon, was their fate.
A Bargain Buyout?
Leonard Green & Partners, a private equity firm in Los Angeles, is cozying up to another buyout. Fresh off its participation in the unsavory yet successful takeover of the retailer J. Crew, Leonard Green is teaming up with owner-managers to buy the discount chain 99 Cents Only. The $1.3 billion bid offers a mere 14 percent premium. It seems to be another sweetheart deal in the making.
After the back-door dealings that marred the J. Crew acquisition, shareholders were left with only a fig leaf of a requirement that managers shop the company elsewhere. Shareholders won some minor concessions but voted to sell the company to TPG and Leonard Green, which hatched the deal with Millard Drexler, the J. Crew chief executive and a big shareholder.
Leonard Green is now looking for something cheaper but equally accessible, and 99 Cents Only is a prime candidate. It has strong cash flow and no debt except leases held off the balance sheet. And investors are starting to think bargain retail may have further to run. The investor Nelson Peltz tried to pounce on Family Dollar last month with an offer of up to $7.6 billion.
The 99 Cents Only chain has other attractions. Its headquarters are geographically close to Leonard Green's. And managers at 99 Cents Only have an outsize influence. The Schiffer-Gold family owns about a third of the company. David Gold is the chairman, Eric Schiffer is the chief executive and Jeff Gold the president and chief operating officer. The three men represent nearly half the seven-member board.
The independent directors could be easy targets, too. Two of them -- 80-year-old Marvin Holen and 76-year-old Lawrence Glascott -- have been sitting in the position for at least 15 years. Mr. Glascott was previously the company's accountant. The other two directors are also Los Angeles fixtures.
If shareholders are lucky, the mellow Southern California vibe won't affect the directors' critical thinking. Leonard Green's offer values the 99 Cents Only enterprise at just over seven times estimated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the year to March 2012.
Family Dollar rejected something closer to nine times. Even the J. Crew deal, for all its shortcomings, provided shareholders a full price. Not everything at 99 Cents Only needs to be sold on the cheap.

Abstract: [...] Jean-Claude Trichet, the central bank president, recently hinted that a rate increase could come as early as next month. If the European Central Bank does tighten its monetary policy, it will not only be tapping the brakes on the region's economy, but may also put further pressure on the dollar, because global investors will be rewarded with higher yields for parking their cash in euros.

Full text: FOR many American investors, European stocks were an afterthought last year, as a growing debt crisis threatened to upend economic recovery on the Continent. But in recent months, European shares have rebounded.
Even as European leaders grapple for a solution to their region's debt crisis, Wall Street is now debating another question: Should investors, who are flocking to blue-chip stocks for the first time in years, favor the European or domestic variety?
Both the Morgan Stanley Capital International Europe index and the Standard & Poor's 500 are up nearly 4 percent this year. "European stocks still offer compelling values," said Mark D. Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia.
The price-to-earnings ratio for European shares is just 13.2, below the 15.2 of the S.& P. 500. For many years previously, European stocks traded at a premium to American shares.
There's also the currency advantage to consider. The Wall Street consensus is that the dollar is likely to weaken further against the euro this year, continuing a trend that's been unfolding since last summer. If that happens, Americans who invest in European shares will enjoy a lift -- over and above any stock price gains -- just because of the euro's relatively stronger value.
They're already enjoying that tail wind. Shares of Siemens, the German conglomerate, for example, have gained 2 percent this year, as the company has enjoyed better-than-expected profits -- partly because of sales growth in rapidly expanding emerging markets. But tack on the effect of the weakening dollar and those returns more than double, to 5 percent.
"A weak dollar is good if you're an American investing overseas," said Alec Young, international equity strategist at S.& P. Equity Research Services. But "if it lasts too long," he added, "it could turn out to be bad."
Just as a falling dollar can improve prospects for American investors abroad, it can be a boost for domestic companies trying to export their products overseas. That's because a weakening currency makes their products cheaper for foreign customers. Conversely, a stronger euro makes it harder for European companies to export their goods.
"There is a price at which the currency exchange rate impacts the business model," said David R. Kotok, chief investment officer at Cumberland Advisors. "It's north of $1.40," he said, referring to the current exchange rate of just under $1.40 to the euro. "But is it $1.50, $1.60, $1.70? I have no idea."
For now, he said, European stocks still look attractive.
But it's not just the weakening dollar that investors must weigh, some strategists say. Another consideration is why the dollar is falling against the euro in the first place.
One reason is that the European Central Bank has signaled that it may soon raise short-term interest rates to combat a rising threat of inflation. In fact, Jean-Claude Trichet, the central bank president, recently hinted that a rate increase could come as early as next month. By comparison, most investors think the Federal Reserve will hold short-term rates in the United States steady until the start of 2012.
Why are the European bankers considering such a quick move? Consumer prices in the region have risen 2.3 percent over the last year, noticeably faster than the 1.6 percent gain in the United States. And rising oil prices, spurred by the political turmoil in the Middle East, is likely to feed European inflation fears.
If the European Central Bank does tighten its monetary policy, it will not only be tapping the brakes on the region's economy, but may also put further pressure on the dollar, because global investors will be rewarded with higher yields for parking their cash in euros. That, in turn, may add to the pressure European exporters -- and their earnings.
"With slower growth and slightly higher inflation there, I would imagine the profit squeeze in Europe will be a little bigger than in the U.S.," said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS Global Insight.
Would that be enough to snuff out the European rally?
Mr. Young said he didn't think so. "If we were talking about rates moving from 4 percent to 5 percent, this would be a bigger issue," he said. But since rates are only about 1 percent now, "It's not that big a factor," he said.
James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, disagrees. He said that if the European Central Bank soon raised rates, "European policy officials will probably come to realize by late summer that they tightened too early."
He expects the domestic economy, meanwhile, to keep heating up. "The combination of hotter growth here and policy changes that could slow the growth there would seem to favor domestic large caps," he said.
For the moment, investors who are wondering where to place bets may want to make decisions case by case and sector by sector, Mr. Kotok said.
Because of uncertainties about health care reform in the United States, he said, investors looking at pharmaceutical companies might favor Sanofi-Aventis -- the French giant that recently bought Genzyme -- over a domestic drug maker.
But, he said, if investors want to bet on energy, they might favor a domestic player like ExxonMobil over Royal Dutch Shell, based in the Netherlands, as Exxon is making a big push into the potentially promising domestic natural gas market.
When it comes to your overall portfolio, though, it's ultimately not a case of either/or, he said. "You need to own stocks both here and over there to be properly diversified," he advised.

Full text: SAN FRANCISCO -- The fake ID has gone digital, and spread to elementary school.
Across the nation, millions of young people are lying about their ages so they can create accounts on popular sites like Facebook and Myspace. These sites require users to be 13 or older, to avoid federal regulations that apply to sites with younger members. But to children, that rule is a minor obstacle that stands between them and what everybody else is doing.
Parents regularly go along with the age inflation, giving permission and helping children set up accounts. They often see it as a minor fib that is necessary to let their children participate in the digital world.
Plenty of people fudge the truth about their age, whether to buy beer or project a younger image to potential mates. But researchers and other critics say allowing children to break the rules sends the wrong message. And, they argue, it sets children loose in a digital world they may not be prepared for -- exposing them to the real-life threats of inappropriate content, contact from strangers and the growing incidents of bullying by computer.
"Not only are kids lying about their age, but more often than not, parents teach them to lie about their age," said Danah Boyd, a social media researcher at Microsoft.
Ms. Boyd said this ran counter to the goal of getting parents more constructively involved in children's online activities, which was one aim of the legislation that spawned the age restrictions in the first place.
At the same time, the practice is hard to stop, say Web sites and federal officials. Sites try to catch under-age users -- "We are not burying our head in the sand," said Joe Sullivan, the chief security officer at Facebook -- but verifying a young person's age over the Internet is a task that ranges from tricky to near impossible.
Cristina Flores, 44, a nurse in San Francisco, said she had decided to allow her 11-year-old son to get onto Facebook rather than deny it to him and risk that he would sign up behind her back. Besides, she said, she did not realize there were any age restrictions on the site.
"It's not like there's a legal age limit for being on the Internet," Ms. Flores said.
Her son Jake said he had told Facebook that he was 15: "I just picked something random."
In one of Jake's fifth-grade classes at Commodore Sloat Elementary school, 15 of the 30 students said they had Facebook accounts.
"And you should see all the third-graders who are on," said Aundrea Kaune, the class's teacher. Last year, she went onto Facebook and was shocked by how many students from the school were there.
"It's lying -- and about age," Ms. Kaune said. "What happens when they want to drink beer?"
The risks for under-age members of social networks are not theoretical. Hemanshu Nigam, the former chief security officer of Myspace, who now runs an Internet safety consulting business, recounted a recent incident from his business. In New York State, he said, an 11-year-old boy accepted a friend request on Facebook from a girl in his class. But the girl's account was fake, and the person behind it began posting images of the boy on sex-oriented sites, along with nasty comments.
When the boy's images started showing up in Google searches, the school suspected that he had posted them and summoned his parents. Other children began picking on him.
"It can be a living nightmare for an 11-year-old who just wanted to hang out with his friends," Mr. Nigam said.
In 2006, 31 percent of 12-year-olds in the United States were using social networks, according to the Pew Research Center's Internet and American Life Project. That figure grew to 38 percent by mid-2009, when the survey was last conducted.
ComScore, a firm that measures Internet traffic, estimates that 3.6 million of Facebook's 153 million monthly visitors in this country are under 12. Some of those visitors may not have Facebook accounts and may simply be visiting public pages, comScore said. (It reached that figure by cross-referencing its own traffic analysis with household demographics.)
Internet companies have set up the rules against under-age users because they must comply with the federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, passed in 1998, which says Web sites that collect information from children younger than 13 must obtain parental consent.
Obtaining that consent is complex and expensive, so companies like Facebook and Google, which owns YouTube, reject anyone who tries to sign up using an age below 13. Google, Facebook and Yahoo all declined to talk about how many children jump the barriers, but they say they try to enforce the rules.
Mr. Sullivan of Facebook said the company blocked new registrations or deleted the accounts of thousands of under-age users every day.
But some children's advocates say these companies are not publicly owning up to the scope of the problem.
"There is no question that Facebook has to be aware that they have a very large number of under-13 members on the site," said Larry Magid, a co-director of ConnectSafely, a nonprofit group that provides information to parents and children.
Mr. Magid and other researchers say the social networks fail to provide under-age users with tools that might protect them.
"Facebook has no resources to help the younger kids, and that's not good," he said.
Facebook does have measures to protect older teenagers from predators, but children who pretend to be older than 18 are bypassing even those safeguards, which place restrictions on how widely minors can share information and who can contact them on the site.
The Federal Trade Commission, which is charged with enforcing the child protection act, acknowledges the problem. But Mary K. Engle, associate director for advertising practices at the commission, said there was no good solution.
In 2008, state attorneys general concerned about child predators helped set up a task force to research online age verification. It concluded that creating a reliable system would be extremely difficult.
"I don't think anyone knows how to prevent a kid from lying about their age," Ms. Engle said.
Victoria Lai, 14, a ninth grader at Galileo Academy of Science and Technology in San Francisco, is a repeat offender.
"The first one was Yahoo, in second grade," said Victoria. "I did it to play games." She followed up by faking her birth date to join Myspace, Facebook and YouTube. "I always say I was born in 1986, not 1996, because it's just one number different. Easy to remember."
In Victoria's fifth-period honors English class, all 32 students said they had faked their birth year to gain access to one site or another.
Victoria's father, Brian Lai, an airline mechanic, said young people "have to have experience using the Internet. It's the future." He said Victoria told him she was going onto the sites, and he told her: "It's not good to lie, but you can make an exception."
Jerry Ng, Victoria's 14-year-old cousin, agreed. "It's one thing to lie to a person," he said. "But this is lying to a computer."
Jerry and Victoria said they were using the sites responsibly: chatting with friends, checking out videos and playing games. And Victoria said her fib had caused only one real hiccup; she appears to be stuck with her incorrect age. After she turned 13, she tried unsuccessfully to turn her birth date back to her real one.
"It wouldn't let me," she said. "So I guess I'll just leave it at that."

The Burden Of Pensions On States

Abstract: That's because several studies have shown that promises to workers are far more costly than routinely calculated by Wisconsin and most states.

Full text: For public workers in Wisconsin, there's more bad news.
Having lost the battle on collective bargaining, they may soon be asked to make more financial sacrifices.
The state's workers offered to start picking up part of the cost of their pensions and health insurance early in their showdown this year with Gov. Scott Walker. That change will provide immediate relief for struggling towns, school districts and state agencies, and help them balance their budgets.
But new pension cost estimates, ordered before Governor Walker was elected, are coming as soon as next week. They are expected to show that the current contribution levels to the state pension system are too meager. More money, from employers and employees in some combination, will be needed, and perhaps much more in coming years.
Other states will also probably find that Wisconsin's idea of simply dividing pension contributions between labor and management is an illusory solution to their long-term financial woes. That's because several studies have shown that promises to workers are far more costly than routinely calculated by Wisconsin and most states.
And the problem seems unlikely to be solved by putting curbs on the collective bargaining power of state workers. Despite the arguments of some Republican governors and popular perception, the places with the most unionized work forces are not necessarily the ones with the most generous pensions, according to a new study.
Coming up with bigger contributions to pension funds will require states to make difficult choices about the size of their work forces, their commitment to public services and the viability of their employee benefits, which are often said to be irreversible and protected by state constitutions.
"The amount they have to be contributing could potentially be two to three times as much as they're contributing now," said Joshua Rauh, an associate professor of finance at Northwestern University, who has been challenging the way most cities and states measure their pension promises. "If you don't want to count on the stock market to pay for all this, this is what you're going to have to contribute."
Mr. Rauh and a number of other analysts say the states' biggest problem has been a failure to understand how much benefits will really cost. Instead of the states' models, these analysts have come up with alternatives that more closely approximate those used by insurance companies.
Unlike recalcitrant states like New Jersey and Illinois, Wisconsin has been setting aside money every year for its fund. It has also been thinking of lowering its reliance on stocks, to reduce its exposure to bear markets.
The issue is whether it has been setting aside anywhere near enough, given the magnitude of its promises to workers.
The idea that public pensions may cost more than expected angers many union officials. They say economists like Mr. Rauh are trying to frighten workers, or build resentment among taxpayers so that public pension funds will be scrapped and replaced with something less generous.
"We think there's an agenda," said Steve Kreisberg, research director for the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. "These numbers have become intensely politicized, and they're being distorted in a way that does real harm to real people."
A spokesman for Wisconsin's governor said Mr. Walker had not factored any possible increase in pension contributions into his budget proposal or talks with the unions. "That was never discussed," said the spokesman, Cullen Werwie.
An analysis being prepared for the state agency that operates Wisconsin's pension system -- and which is to be presented to the agency's board on Wednesday -- is expected to show that it has been relying on too high a figure for investment gains. If the system's trustees accept those findings, overall cash contributions will have to rise.
The actuary preparing the analysis is not tipping his hand, but any increase at this point is likely to be small. The state estimates that 12 percent of all public workers' pay will need to be set aside annually for the pension fund. Lowering investment expectations sharply, to 7 percent a year from the current 7.8 percent, could push the contribution rate up to perhaps 16 percent, meaning an additional $2,000 to $3,000 a year apiece for workers nearing retirement.
Based on the 12 percent figure, workers agreed earlier this year to contribute 5.8 percent of their pay to the pension fund, leaving their employers to pay the remaining 6.2 percent. Workers also agreed to cover a portion of their health costs. How to pay for health benefits for retirees is still being discussed.
Workers in Wisconsin point out that their payments in retirement are hardly a king's ransom. Their average annual benefit is about $26,500, and they believe they have been wrongly portrayed as greedy chiselers who game the system and walk away with six-figure pensions.
But it can be a huge burden for states and municipalities to provide even a modest, $26,000-a-year pension to hundreds of thousands of people, at least in today's economic environment, and especially if those people are able to retire well before 65 and collect that money for many years.
"When interest rates are low, these plans are really expensive to run," said Gordon Latter, an actuary at Voyageur Asset Management whose clients include both corporate and public pension funds.
Despite the furor in Wisconsin, collective bargaining does not appear to be the main factor driving pension costs higher.
Sylvester J. Schieber, an economist and independent consultant, recently compared public pensions in each of the 50 states, ranking them from richest to poorest. Instead of looking at dollar values, like Wisconsin's $26,500 a year, Mr. Schieber looked at what part of the average worker's paycheck his pension was designed to replace in retirement. The method eliminates regional disparities and certain other problems with benefit-cost data.
Mr. Kreisberg of the public workers union said he considered the approach fair.
Mr. Schieber said he expected to find that the most generous states were the ones with collective bargaining for public workers, but he found no correlation whatsoever. "I was surprised at the result," he said. "I had expected that the unions would be a significant force."
Wisconsin turned out to have the eighth-richest pensions of any state, replacing on average 57 percent of a worker's pay in retirement. But the most generous state by far is Colorado -- even though it has granted collective bargaining to only a fourth of its public work force. In Wisconsin, roughly half are covered, according to Unionstats.com, a database that uses Census data to track union membership.
Colorado offers pensions that replace 90 percent of salary, with generous annual compounding that more than keeps up with the current rate of inflation. (The state has tried to reduce this compounding; retirees have sued.) Colorado's pensions are unusually rich because its public workers are not permitted to participate in Social Security -- the state pension is the only one they get.
The second-richest state is New York, which replaces 77 percent of a worker's income, even though New York's public work force earns Social Security benefits as well. A New Yorker's public pension benefit, combined with Social Security, replaces more than 100 percent of his pay, Mr. Schieber found.
That might appear to be the fruits of collective bargaining, since New York State grants that right to more of its public work force than any other state. But the third most generous state is Georgia, replacing 68 percent of a retiree's former paycheck on average. And Georgia is a right-to-work state with one of the lowest rates of collective bargaining in America, just 14 percent of its public work force.
Nonunion Georgia's public pensions are, in fact, three times as generous as those of labor-friendly Vermont, where more than half the public work force has collective bargaining. Vermont replaces just 20 percent of a retiree's previous pay, the lowest of any state.
Mr. Schieber said he was at a loss to explain these findings. He had expected rich pensions would go hand in hand with collective bargaining.
But his research, to be published in the Journal of Pension Economics and Finance, does shed light on how a seemingly modest $26,000-a-year pension can be considered unaffordably rich. One reason is low interest rates; another is that public employees can often start claiming their pensions in their 50s. Wisconsin's pension plan allows people to retire at 57 with a full pension, as long as they have 30 years of service. Police officers and firefighters can retire at 53, with 25 years of service.
In the private sector, pensions like that "have just kind of dropped off the radar screen," Mr. Schieber said. At the dwindling number of companies that still grant full pensions below age 65, people seldom take them, for fear of giving up their health insurance before they qualify for Medicare. Labor statistics show a marked increase in the number of 60- to 65-year-olds still working.
Public employees have so far dodged that bullet. They can still generally retire several years younger, which means their states or municipalities must pay their benefits over a longer period. That adds up. It also means the money for their benefits has fewer years to compound, so more must be set aside years in advance.
"By the time the typical private-sector worker has retired, the teachers, the highway patrolmen and these folks have already gotten $200,000, $300,000, $400,000 in pensions," Mr. Schieber said. "Plus, they're getting a pretty rich retiree health benefit. That's why these benefits are so expensive. "

Abstract: The Germans would also force private bondholders who bought the high-yielding debt of the most troubled euro-zone countries to bear part of the burden if countries defaulted or needed to restructure their debt -- and not be protected by taxpayers. Since November, the Germans have been in nonstop talks with officials in Brussels and with the French, with whom they have an extraordinarily close relationship.

Full text: BERLIN -- Faced with financial turmoil that has resisted every emergency fix the European Union has adopted, European leaders are considering a radical step: giving up some of their independence to set domestic economic policies and cutting back many of the wage and welfare benefits that have defined the region's politics for decades. In return, the European Union would provide funds to shore up the weakest member states, including Portugal, Greece and Spain.
The proposals, originally pressed by the newly assertive German chancellor, will be debated Friday in what is expected to be a contentious session of the leaders of the 17 countries that use the euro.
Germany is calling for several measures: raising retirement ages to reduce the burden on pension funds, ending the linking of wages to increases in the cost of living, committing to debt reduction and submitting to a level of budget scrutiny that was until recently considered anathema -- and is still viewed by many as a step too far.
The meeting is made more urgent by a continuing financial crisis that, despite occasional lulls, has kept markets on edge for months. On Thursday, Moody's Investors Service downgraded the Spanish government's debt, sending stock prices sharply down in Europe and contributing to a selloff in the United States as well. More analysts are suggesting that Portugal will need a bailout and that Greece's debt will need to be restructured, despite earlier rescue packages that were intended to make such steps unnecessary.
If the euro is to be saved and a solution found for the divisions in the euro zone, Germany must agree to act as the region's lender of last resort. And for that, Chancellor Angela Merkel, with political problems even within her own governing coalition, has a steep price. She has moved into a visible position of European leadership, trying to frame the debate in German terms and impose her will on her neighbors.
But a comprehensive deal will be difficult to reach. The proposals under debate now have already been watered down from a more robust program of integration and monitoring first put forward by Germany, and will be subject to further negotiation before a full European Union summit meeting on March 24-25, two days before an important German state election.
"There's a common understanding that we need to help Merkel get something that looks like a victory," said a senior European Union official, who, like other officials interviewed, was not authorized to comment by name. "And for the markets, we need to end March with a comprehensive approach."
For Mrs. Merkel, the answer is a permanent bailout fund for euro-zone governments in trouble now and in the future. The debts of the most indebted nations, like Greece and Ireland, will be covered, with room, if necessary, for Portugal and Spain.
But in return for this "solidarity," the Germans say they want "solidity" on limiting benefits and accepting monitoring. Among the measures it is pressing is an agreement to raise retirement ages closer to Germany's, where access to government pensions begins at age 67, well above the European average. Germany would also like others to stop pegging wage increases automatically to inflation. That is a necessary step if wages are to shrink in absolute terms, which some economists argue is necessary if bitter medicine to inject some competitiveness into the economies of Europe's southern tier.
The Germans would also force private bondholders who bought the high-yielding debt of the most troubled euro-zone countries to bear part of the burden if countries defaulted or needed to restructure their debt -- and not be protected by taxpayers.
Since November, the Germans have been in nonstop talks with officials in Brussels and with the French, with whom they have an extraordinarily close relationship. They have been working on at least three levels for a comprehensive package.
The most important is a "permanent regime" -- the so-called European Stability Mechanism, which will replace the temporary bailout fund called the European Financial Stability Facility, set up during the Greek crisis last May. That fund ends in June 2013, and the Germans want a permanent fund of perhaps 500 billion euros ($695 billion) to show the markets that the euro zone is prepared for future problems.
But that fund must also show Germans that private investors will not be bailed out by taxpayers, that no country will assume the debts of another and that there will be collateral offered and penalties for bad behavior.
The governments are also in heated discussions about whether and how to strengthen and extend the existing temporary fund of 440 billion euros ($612 billion), intended to help Greece and Ireland, to allow it to lend the entire amount, which could then cover Portugal and Spain. But Berlin does not want the fund to be used to buy back Greek or Irish bonds.
The issue that has gotten the most attention is the German-French Pact for Competitiveness, a name chosen for German ears. The intention was to lay down specific commitments to coordinate euro-zone economies -- a common basis for corporate taxes for instance, or a common age for retirement -- intended to unify policies across the region while raising tax revenue and reducing spending. Wage indexation was to be banned and high deficits punished.
But when the pact was first broached at the European level last month, there was anger from other leaders, who had not been consulted. While the pact might help in the future, it would do nothing to solve the current problems of Greece, Ireland and Portugal. Nor, critics argue, does it deal with a looming problem for Germany and the euro zone -- huge private debt and shaky banks, including some German state banks. Berlin has resisted serious stress tests of its banks.
Still, on Friday, euro-zone leaders are expected to approve a watered-down version of the pact, negotiated by the European Council president, Herman Van Rompuy, that eliminates fixed pension ages and wage indexation and gives states more latitude to reach objectives, with monitoring of compliance left unclear. The main fight is about whether to align corporate tax systems, and if so, how to do so.
But German officials contend that commitments remaining in the pact are important, that retirement ages and benefit systems should be adjusted to fiscal and demographic realities and that each country must find a way to make debt limits binding, as Berlin has done.
Mrs. Merkel is insisting that all three levels represent a package, and that there will be no increase even in the temporary bailout fund unless there is a deal on the pact.
A senior French official said: "The Germans have moved far in the last months from their initial position, but they knew they had our support. The face-saving aspect is very important for Germany. A lot of countries are infuriated with Berlin but can't say so, because they need Germany, so in a way they're hostages and have to go along."
But it will still be a difficult case for Mrs. Merkel to sell domestically. By the end of the month, another senior European Union official said, "Merkel will have to swallow" an increase in the temporary fund to allow it to lend fully; a non-German as head of the European Central Bank, probably an Italian, Mario Draghi; and a two-sentence change in the Lisbon Treaty that will not produce the binding criteria and penalties Berlin wanted to reinforce fiscal discipline.
The euro crisis will not be over, said Henrik Enderlein, a political economist at the Hertie School of Governance in Berlin. "The result will be a watered-down package that won't change a lot and won't end the crisis," he said.
Jean Pisani-Ferry, the director of Bruegel, a Brussels-based economic research institution, said the steps under discussion now were necessary, but were likely to prove insufficient. There still must be an intense effort to create competitiveness in the euro zone, to help the lagging nations of southern Europe liberalize their economies and labor markets, to bring down manufacturing costs and to produce growth.
"Even if we do all the right things, how fast will southern Europe catch up?" Mr. Pisani-Ferry asked. "Because it must. If not, these countries will find themselves in permanent unemployment and not growing, and then you will need real transfers to keep the euro zone together."

Full text: The rally in stocks is now two years old. The M.S.C.I. global index has nearly doubled since March 9, 2009, the postfinancial crisis nadir. Credit markets are thriving, and economic activity has returned. Yet the government actors behind the rebound look spent. Financial markets are on their own for future shocks.
A call to arms from the world's governments pulled the financial system back from the brink two years ago. Guaranteeing bank debt, slashing interest rates, buying more than $1 trillion of assets and stress testing large banks were among the moves that restored stability and revived markets. President Obama may have seen all the activity coming: On March 3, 2009, he called stocks "a potentially good deal."
Even the derivatives index used to hedge subprime mortgage loans is up 25 percent, according to Barclays Capital. With oil up more than 120 percent in two years and gold 55 percent higher, commodities look frothy. The International Monetary Fund on Monday noted "overheating" in emerging markets.
Meanwhile, there remain plenty of potential flashpoints. Turmoil in the Middle East, which has increased the price of oil, is the most immediate. Sovereign debt stresses in Europe remain worrying. And rising inflation combined with an increase in interest rates is another situation that could torpedo market sentiment.
For investors from banks to hedge funds, however, the safe options that may protect them against these risks just don't make enough money. Short-term interest rates, for instance, are mostly still low, especially the Federal Reserve's zero to 0.25 percent. They prefer, as before the crisis, to shoulder risk in return for more yield.
But this time there's no real government safety net. Huge budget deficits in the developed world leave little ammunition for governments. Politics won't allow further large-scale intervention, especially in the United States.
True, central banks like the Fed have shown themselves prepared to print money, even though doing more of that would run the risk of further undermining confidence.
The government-fueled bull run is fresh in investors' minds. But they might do well not to forget the dark days two years ago.
A Dog of a Deal
Walgreens, the pharmacy chain, has showed its arch-rival a solution to its problems by selling its pharmacy benefits management arm to better focus on retailing.
Walgreens' top competitor, CVS, has taken the opposite tack since it paid $26 billion for Caremark. That dog of a deal, which has dragged down performance and led to an antitrust inquiry, looks increasingly in need of unwinding.
True, Walgreens' pharmacy benefits management business was never a big part of the company. The unit, which is selling for $525 million in cash to Catalyst Health Solutions, contributes less than 2 percent to Walgreens' bottom line. Still, with the middleman gone, Walgreens' managers will be better concentrated on the firm's core business.
Contrast that with CVS-Caremark. The company runs a retail operation similar in scale to Walgreens along with a giant pharmacy benefits management company. Since the two merged, the Caremark business has lost some big contracts and downgraded its earnings forecasts. It has also spent precious management time explaining to the Federal Trade Commission why the combination doesn't hurt consumers.
Investors have noticed. The shares have underperformed and trade at a discount to other drugstore chains and pure-play pharmacy benefits firms Medco Health and Express Scripts. To the market, the group is neither fish nor fowl.
The solution is to let them swim their separate ways again.
CVS-Caremark claimed $700 million of synergies from merging. But even if these vanished, their net present value would still amount to less than the potential upside from splitting.
Moreover, the looming presence of the antitrust inquiry would vanish. Here's a case where the market might nicely do regulators' dirty work.

Full text: HONG KONG -- Rain and snow during the past two weeks, together with a huge irrigation effort, appear to have saved much of the wheat crop in northern China from drought, Chinese and international agricultural and meteorological experts said Monday.
This winter was the driest in perhaps 200 years in parts of China, the world's largest wheat producer. That prompted alarm a month ago that China might need to sharply increase its usually modest wheat imports, at a time when world food prices were already surging. Supplies were tight after bad weather in other wheat-producing countries, including Russia and Australia.
But days of snow and rain across the heart of China's wheat belt in northern Henan and western Shandong Provinces have brought moisture to fields so dry that large cracks appeared in the dirt. The precipitation arrived at just the right moment, experts said, as vulnerable wheat planted last autumn was coming out of its winter dormancy and needed to grow or it would die.
"Things look better, definitely, and the government seems to be in control with irrigation and providing a lot of assistance to farmers," Kisan Gunjal, an official at the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in Rome, said in a telephone interview on Monday. Mr. Gunjal is responsible for food shortfall alerts in Asia.
Chen Xiwen, the Chinese Communist Party's director of rural policy, said at a news conference in Beijing on Sunday that three rounds of precipitation and extra irrigation efforts had left less than a third of China's wheat acreage still suffering from drought.
Experts agreed that recent rain and snow had done much to relieve the drought. "The situation was rather tense when we did not have rain for over 50 days," said Tian Qi Zhu, a wheat specialist at Shandong Agricultural University in Tai'an, in western Shandong.
"However, with the two recent snowfalls, the drought situation is pretty much alleviated," Mr. Tian said Monday. "Except for some areas up in the hill region of Shandong, where there is still insufficient water, I would say the drought is under control."
A good wheat harvest could help China control inflation. Prime Minister Wen Jiabao said that price stability was a top priority for China this year.
Winter in China's wheat belt is usually fairly dry. But this winter was so dry that it provoked considerable concern, from government offices in Beijing to the grain markets of Chicago.
President Hu Jintao and Mr. Wen separately toured parched wheat fields during the Lunar New Year holidays and urged emergency irrigation and other efforts. The United Nations food agency issued a rare "special alert" on Feb. 8 warning of the drought's effects on the wheat crop and even on drinking water for people and livestock.
Wheat futures in Chicago, already high because of extreme heat in Russia last summer, surged even higher when the food agency issued its alert, jumping 2 percent in a day. On Monday, wheat futures edged down 31.5 cents, or 3.8 percent, after word spread of China's recent damp weather.
China has been planning to send more trade delegations to the United States this year to look for imports to help balance its enormous exports and persistent trade surpluses. But grain experts said that it would be hard to discern quickly whether China was buying more wheat from the United States.
Virtually all of the wheat grown in China is fairly low quality, which works fine for making noodles, an important food, particularly in northern China. China imports some high-grade wheat every year for use in bread and pastries, which are becoming increasingly popular in its cities. Chinese-grown wheat is almost never suitable for making croissants and other Western delicacies, agriculture experts said.

Full text: BAGHDAD -- As protesters throughout the Arab world challenge their authoritarian leaders, Iraqis, government officials and regional experts see increasing signs that Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki is expanding his power, undermining the fragile democracy struggling to take hold here.
A ruling in January by Iraq's highest court -- sought by Mr. Maliki -- gave him control of once independent agencies responsible for running the country's central bank, conducting elections and investigating corruption.
A month after that ruling, two leading human rights groups said that forces that reported directly to Mr. Maliki, in violation of the country's Constitution, were running secret jails where detainees had been tortured.
And in July, Iraq's high court ruled that members of Parliament no longer had the power to propose legislation. Instead, all new laws would have to be proposed by Mr. Maliki's cabinet or the president and then passed to the Parliament for a vote.
Political experts said they knew of no other parliamentary democracy that had such restrictions.
With influence from the United States waning as the military prepares to withdraw at the end of the year, Mr. Maliki's critics say that one legacy of the eight-year American occupation is a democratically elected leader from the country's Shiite majority who has far more power than the Constitution intended.
Critics said that the court ruling in January was a particularly damaging blow to the country's voting process and feeble economy. Sean Kane, the program officer for Iraq at the United States Institute of Peace, a Congressionally financed research center, said that the decision appeared to contradict Iraq's Constitution, which he said stated that the commissions had varying levels of responsibility to Parliament.
Referring to the recent court ruling, Aliya Nasaif, a lawmaker from the Iraqiya coalition, a rival to Mr. Maliki's State of Law bloc, said: "Because there is no law, you will find him overwhelming other institutions. This is the beginning of dictatorship. We are regressing by centuries."
Mr. Maliki has tried to respond to public discontent by giving his cabinet 100 days to come up with ways to improve services. He has also promised to cut his pay and not seek a third term in 2014.
An official for the United States Embassy said that Mr. Maliki and his advisers were trying to signal that they understood the outrage of Iraqis over corruption and poverty.
Those concessions, however, have done little to mollify Iraqis, and thousands took to the streets last week, sometimes violently, to protest the government's failure to provide electricity and jobs.
Rights groups criticized the government for what they called a violent crackdown on those demonstrations, saying that scores of people -- including journalists -- were beaten and detained.
On Friday, protesters took the streets again, although there were far fewer reports of violence. Nevertheless, in the southern city of Basra, several journalists at a protest reported that they had been beaten by security forces.
Mr. Maliki, an uncharismatic but canny politician who was elected prime minister in 2006, has been credited with helping reduce the violence that once threatened to tear Iraq apart.
But his critics say those victories have come at a cost. They accuse Mr. Maliki of taking a stronger hand over Iraq's powerful police and military forces by leaving the slots of defense and interior minister open indefinitely, allowing him to act as the head of both agencies.
"The developments in recent months have provoked real concern across the Iraqi political spectrum, and the responsibility now rests largely with the Parliament to check the prime minister's power," said Jason Gluck, a rule of law adviser at the United States Institute of Peace and an adviser to the Iraqi Parliament in 2007. "Whether the diverse political parties in Parliament can effectively do so will be a critical test for Iraq's burgeoning democracy."
One of Mr. Maliki's top advisers, Ali al-Moussawi, said that the once independent agencies had "irregularities and problems" in the past because of "the lack of supervision."
Mr. Moussawi said the new oversight would focus on administrative matters but would not interfere with the overall missions of the institutions.
"The noise against the court decision is for political reasons," Mr. Moussawi said. "Those who make this noise are not doing it for the sake of these bodies but for political gains."
Mr. Maliki had been seen as a fairly weak leader until 2008, when he ordered an Iraqi military offensive against Shiite militias, which had taken control of parts of southern Iraq. His critics say he continued to strengthen his power by using his security forces to resolve political disputes, particularly in Kurdistan.
Mr. Maliki narrowly lost in the March 2010 election and appeared significantly weakened. But he muscled his way to a second term after favorable decisions from the election commission and the high court, allowing him to assemble a wide-ranging coalition government in December.
Joost Hiltermann, an Iraq expert for the International Crisis Group, said that Mr. Maliki had benefited from the fact that Iraq has not been a top priority for the Obama administration.
Some members of Iraq's fractious Parliament, a rubber-stamp institution under Saddam Hussein, have said they would take measures to check Mr. Maliki's power, vowing to cut funds to security agencies controlled by the prime minister and to pass laws that limited him.
None of those attempts, however, have gained much traction, in large part because the opposition is so divided.
The degree of the court's independence is unclear. The Iraqi Constitution is vague on how members of the court can be removed and appointed, and what guarantees its independence.
Officials with the election commission said they were baffled by the court's decision placing them under Mr. Maliki's supervision. They also worried that Iraqis would lose faith in the credibility of local and national elections if Mr. Maliki's office began to select election monitors or to change the rules governing where voting took place, how ballots were counted and who ran polling stations.
Faraj al-Haidari, head of Iraq's election commission, said that United Nations officials had expressed their concern about the ruling to him.
Shortly after the decision was handed down, Mr. Haidari said he had received a letter from Mr. Maliki's office telling the commission to halt the appointments of 38 low-level election officials. He said the commission had refused.
Fear has also extended to the central bank, where officials said they worried that Mr. Maliki would now have the power to order the institution to print money to cover Iraq's growing budget deficits. Such a move would weaken the value of Iraq's anemic currency and lead to rapid inflation.
"Our fear is that they will now see it as their money," said the bank's senior adviser, Mudher M. Salih Kasim.

Full text: HONG KONG -- With oil prices at their highest level in more than two years because of unrest in North Africa and the Middle East, the Chinese government plans to announce strict five-year goals for energy conservation in the next two weeks, China energy specialists said Friday.
Bejing's emphasis on saving energy reflects concerns about national security and the effects of high fuel costs on inflation, China's export competitiveness and the country's pollution problems.
Any energy policy moves by Beijing hold global implications, given that China is the world's biggest consumer of energy and largest emitter of greenhouse gases. And even the new efficiency goals assume that China's overall energy consumption will grow, to meet the needs of the nation's 1.3 billion people and its rapidly expanding economy.
As a net importer of oil, China tends to view its energy needs as a matter of national security. And so, even as Beijing tries to quell any signs of the Arab world's social unrest striking a political chord with Chinese citizens, the government is also intent on not letting similar upheaval impinge on its energy needs.
Zhang Guobao, who was China's longtime energy czar until his retirement in January and is still a power broker on energy issues, said Friday that China must undertake an "arduous" task to protect its security. "Oil security is the most important part of achieving energy security," Mr. Zhang told the official Xinhua news agency. "Preparations for alternative energies should be made as soon as possible."
China has placed a big bet on renewable energy, emerging as the world's biggest and lowest-cost manufacturer of wind turbines and solar panels. But the country remains heavily reliant on coal for its electricity. And its oil imports are surging after auto sales have surpassed the American market in each of the last two years.
China has also moved ahead of the United States as the biggest buyer of oil and natural gas from Saudi Arabia, which has so far avoided social upheaval but is on Mideast analysts' watch lists. That oil is shipped in tankers that travel along sea lanes controlled by India and the United States, which adds to Beijing's jitters.
Iran, hardly a bastion of stability, is another large supplier of crude oil to China.
And while Russia in the current geopolitical context is looking like a relatively secure supplier of energy, a large pipeline to China from Russia, completed this winter, so far supplies only 3 percent of China's crude oil.
An important feature of the five-year plan is its call to double the share of natural gas in Chinese energy consumption, to 8 percent in 2015 from 4 percent last year, according to Fatih Birol, the chief economist of the multilateral International Energy Agency in Paris. This will make China a natural buyer of large quantities of Russian gas, making it a competitor to Europe, which already relies heavily on gas from Russia.
According to an estimate by Wood Mackenzie, a global energy consulting firm, China imports nearly two-thirds of its oil and is on track to pass the United States in the percentage of imported oil this year. China was a net exporter as recently as 1992, before the demands of its economic boom created an insatiable energy appetite at home.
As part of its effort to curb oil demand, the Chinese government has already been pursuing an aggressive program to develop electric cars, although these would run at least initially on a national grid that still relies heavily on coal.
China aims to limit energy consumption in 2015 to four billion metric tons of coal or its equivalent in other fuels, Mr. Zhang said. An energy specialist in Beijing said that he had also been told the same figure by several people.
Even a goal of four billion metric tons of coal or its equivalent represents an annual increase of 4.24 percent from last year's consumption of a little more than 3.2 billion tons.
No decisions have been made yet on how the almost entirely state-owned energy sector would allocate the limits by city, province or electric utility. This is already causing considerable anxiety within China, said the specialist, who insisted on anonymity because of the government's sensitivity about goals that have not yet been announced.
"It's a political target, it's being taken without a lot of internal consultation," he said, before adding a Chinese proverb to describe the unhappy reaction of power producers and users already briefed on the new policy: "It's like a whole lot of ants are being thrown in a hot wok."
The Chinese economy has repeatedly grown considerably faster than government forecasts. But the government has come much closer to its energy goals because it owns all of the electricity distribution systems. And it has controlling stakes in the oil, gas and electricity companies and many coal mining companies.
The last five year-plan, which ended on Dec. 31, called for the country to reduce by 20 percent the energy it used per renminbi of economic output in 2010, compared to 2005. To try meeting that goal, Beijing required the governments of every province and city to achieve 20 percent improvements. Local officials, in turn, set similar goals for the 200 largest companies in each province and city.
But China fell badly behind its goal in late 2009 and early last year. The government's economic stimulus program, in response to the global financial crisis, produced huge spending on highways, high-speed rail lines and other infrastructure that required lots of steel and cement, which are energy-intensive to produce.
Premier Wen Jiabao responded last May by starting a national campaign to improve energy efficiency and soon vowed an "iron hand"to enforce compliance. By September, the government was ordering production lines to close at 2,000 factories.
The campaign reached extremes last autumn and early winter, with some town officials shutting off electricity and heat to businesses, homes and even hospitals in desperate bids to avoid censure for missing their goals.
Despite the measures, the government fell slightly short. Senior officials initially said in January that the country had "basically" met the 20 percent goal. But statistics issued since then show an improvement of only 19.1 percent over the last five years.
Meeting the new target of no more than four billion metric tons of coal or its equivalent will require further improvements in efficiency if the economy expands 7 percent a year in the coming years.
Much greater efficiency gains would be needed if the economy grows even faster, as most economists predict. The Chinese economy expanded 10.3 percent last year.
Mr. Wen and others for years have resisted setting total energy consumption goals and have only issued efficiency goals -- precisely because overall consumption goals could require drastic measures to meet if the economy surges.
There was no immediate explanation available on Friday, other than troubles in the Arab world, for why the government had now decided to embrace an overall target.
The goals in China's new five-year plan are consistent with the International Energy Agency's "new policies" plan for climate change, a middle course that represents an improvement from current policies, Mr. Birol said. But he noted that the Chinese goals did not go far enough to meet what the agency considers necessary to prevent world temperatures from rising by more than 2 degrees Celsius, an increase that many scientists fear as potentially leading to very broad environmental changes.
Mr. Zhang and other Chinese officials have made little mention of climate change, which has ranked far behind energy security as a priority in Chinese policy making.
Zhou Yongkang, one of the nine members of the Politburo Standing Committee that runs China and the top law enforcement official of the Chinese Communist Party, is an oil engineer who spent most of his career rising to the top of the country's oil industry. He retains considerable influence over energy policy even though his job now is crushing internal dissent.
Most recently, Mr. Zhou has overseen efforts to round up dissidents and make sure that the "Jasmine Revolution" does not spread from the Arab region to China. Premier Wen and other top officials have also warned recently that rising prices for many commodities pose a threat to social stability.

Full text: CORRECTION APPENDED
INFLATION in the United States is low, and seems to be going down if it is moving at all. The Federal Reserve thinks it will be years before there is any significant inflation.
But that is not the way many Americans see it. Gasoline prices are on the rise as the Libyan fighting intensifies, and some food items have risen. The high price of gold -- more than $1,400 an ounce -- is viewed by many, including some in Congress, as proof that rampant inflation is near.
Testifying in Congress this week, Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, tried to be reassuring. "The most likely outcome is that the recent rise in commodity prices will lead to, at most, a temporary and relatively modest increase in U.S. consumer price inflation," he said.
Yet inflation anxiety is rising.
"Are the Fed and the public on different planets?" Dennis Lockhart, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, asked in a speech last month. "There seems to be a disconnect between what the Fed is saying and what people are experiencing when they fill up their gas tanks or read about rising food prices around the world."
The inflation rate most closely monitored by the Fed is one few noneconomists have ever heard of -- the personal consumption expenditure deflator. In concept, it is similar to the Consumer Price Index, but it is based on changes in prices of items that are actually used during a period, rather than on a fixed basket of purchases. This week, the Fed announced that the index level for January was up just 1.2 percent from a year earlier.
The increase in the core rate -- the rate excluding volatile food and energy prices -- was only 0.8 percent. As can be seen in the accompanying chart, it has never been lower in the years since the government began keeping the figure in 1959.
The Fed's goal is to keep the inflation rate at or near 2 percent, and it does not expect a significant increase for at least a few years. In January, nearly all members of the Fed's Open Market Committee thought that both the core rate and the overall rate would not rise above that figure through 2013, as can also be seen from the chart. The stock market is generally thought to do better when inflation is falling, but Martin Fridson, the global credit strategist for BNP Paribas Investment Partners, points out that is not always the case. There is, he says, a time when inflation is too low.
The accompanying chart, based on a report by Mr. Fridson, shows that from the 1940s through the 1990s, there generally was a relationship. The more inflation declined in a decade from inflation in the previous decade, the better the stock market did.
But in two decades, the 1930s and the first decade of this century, inflation fell from already low levels and the stock market suffered. "Below a certain level of inflation," Mr. Fridson said, "a further decline reflects economic weakness more than it reflects a salutary reining in of excessive monetary creation."
If that is correct, then it could be that both investors and those simply concerned with promoting economic growth should, as Mr. Fridson wrote, hope that Mr. Bernanke "fails in his stated goal of holding inflation to 2 percent or less."

Online Correction: March 4, 2011, Friday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of the chart that accompanies this column misstated the "Average Annual Inflation Rate" for the 1960s as 2 percent and the "Change from Prior Decade" as 2.3 percent.

Chart Is Lower Inflation Bad News?: As a General Rule, the Stock Market Does Better During Periods of Declining Inflation Than It Does When Prices Are Rising. But There Are Two Exceptions -- The 1930s and the First Decade of This Century. It Appears That Declines From Already Low Inflation Rates Alarm Investors. Figures Show Compound Annual Total Return for the S.&P. 500 for Each Decade, and the Change in the Annual Inflation Rate, As Measured by the Consumer Price Index, for Each Decade Compared with the Previous One.

Abstract: [...] as prices for agricultural land surge across America's grain belt, regulators are warning that a new real estate bubble may be forming -- echoing the frothy boom in home prices that saw values in Miami and Las Vegas skyrocket and then plummet. Low interest rates have also contributed; they draw investors seeking an alternative to low-yielding certificates of deposit and the volatile stock market as well as create an incentive for farmers to buy more land rather than invest their profits elsewhere.

Full text: The 80 acres of rich farmland that Jeff Freking and his brother Randy bought near Le Mars, Iowa, on Monday for $10,000 an acre would seem to have nothing in common with a condo in Miami or a house in Las Vegas.
But as prices for agricultural land surge across America's grain belt, regulators are warning that a new real estate bubble may be forming -- echoing the frothy boom in home prices that saw values in Miami and Las Vegas skyrocket and then plummet.
"It just seems to be going up in leaps and bounds here," said Jeff Freking, who bought a similar farm, also in northwestern Iowa, for $6,000 an acre just two years ago. "Everybody thinks it's crazy."
The surge in prices has been dizzying throughout the Midwest, with double-digit percentage increases last year in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota and Nebraska. In parts of Iowa, prices for good farmland rose as much as 23 percent last year, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago.
Just a few years ago, farmers marveled as land prices began to rise in response to demand for corn to make ethanol. More recently, soaring prices for wheat, corn, soybeans and other crops have driven the increase. Corn futures on the Chicago Board of Trade closed at $7.27 a bushel on Tuesday, up from $3.70 a year earlier. Soybean futures were $13.67, up from $9.52 cents on March 1 last year. Average grain prices, adjusted for inflation, are nearing the giddy levels they reached in the late 1970s, the peak of the last disastrous boom-and-bust cycle for agricultural land.
That has regulators worried.
"History has taught us that it is nearly impossible to determine how much of the farmland boom may be an unsustainable bubble driven by financial markets," said Thomas M. Hoenig, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, in testimony before the Senate Agriculture Committee last month.
Officials at Mr. Hoenig's bank warn that farmers face a "huge" risk that rising interest rates, perhaps combined with falling crop prices, could undercut land values. Farmland values could drop by a third to a half in such a situation, Mr. Hoeing testified.
Prices have risen so far so fast that "it's getting scary," said Mike Green, a real estate auctioneer. He brought the hammer down last Friday on a 118-acre farm in Yetter, Iowa, that sold for $11,000 an acre, which he said was a record for farmland in Calhoun County, in western Iowa. In December, Mr. Green said, he got oohs and ahs when a parcel went for $9,300 an acre. Last fall, similar farms were selling for less than $8,000 an acre.
"It's very hard to guess what a property will sell for these days because it seems like it's been changing on a weekly basis," he said.
Nationwide data from the United States Department of Agriculture shows that inflation-adjusted farm prices passed their 1970s peak several years ago, but that includes land, especially on the coasts, whose price rose when it was sold for development. University and Federal Reserve Bank surveys, which give a more accurate picture of the value of land used for farming, show that current prices are approaching the top of the last boom when adjusted for inflation.
Farmland values have been pushed up by several factors. As crops like corn, wheat and soybeans bring higher prices, the land on which they are grown becomes more valuable. Low interest rates have also contributed; they draw investors seeking an alternative to low-yielding certificates of deposit and the volatile stock market as well as create an incentive for farmers to buy more land rather than invest their profits elsewhere.
"Farmland has been a favored asset class in a world where a lot of other asset classes have fallen out of favor," said Richard A. Brown, chief economist of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
The rapid rise in agricultural land prices has raised alarms at the F.D.I.C., which insures bank deposits and monitors the industry's financial health. The agency sent a letter to lenders in December, warning them to not let high farm land values lull them into lax lending practices. Next week, the F.D.I.C. will hold a forum in Washington to discuss its concerns.
"If it were to be a bubble," Mr. Brown said, "it would be in its formative stages."
Today's farmland market has some crucial differences from the 1970s bubble and the housing boom of the last decade. In the 1970s, another period of low interest and high crop prices, farmers loaded up on debt, using their farms as collateral. In the housing bubble, many buyers were seduced by gimmicky loans, such as subprime mortgages with floating rates, that magnified risk.
Today, farmers have about one-third less debt over all than they did at the peak of the last boom, according to U.S.D.A. data.
But a big worry for regulators is that farmers will start taking out loans on property they already own, based on today's elevated values, and use it to buy more property or make other purchases. That would be similar to what farmers did 30 years ago and what homeowners did in the housing boom.
Jason R. Henderson, a vice president at the Omaha branch of the Kansas City Fed, said he had heard reports from bankers that such a pattern might be emerging.
Mr. Freking said he and his brother had made their latest purchase using all borrowed money. Their banker lent them half of the purchase price, and the rest of the money came from refinancing and consolidating loans on other property they owned, which are worth more at current land values.
He said there was some sticker shock at the price but the deal made sense because the land adjoined two other properties that the family farmed. He also got an attractive fixed interest rate of about 5 percent, although the loan must be paid off after eight years.
"Everybody's talking big on commodities, so hopefully this pays out," Mr. Freking said.
The rising prices have also brought in speculators. A survey by Iowa State University found that investors made a quarter of farm purchases in the state last year, a slight increase from 2009. "It's been very aggressive as far as bidding action," said Todd Hattermann, an auctioneer who sold a farm in Paullina, Iowa, about 30 miles from Le Mars, for $9,600 an acre last week. Investors, he said, were "running the values up. A lot of them may not be the final bidder but they're bidding all the way through."
There is no agreement on whether a bubble is emerging.
Michael D. Duffy, an agricultural economist at Iowa State University who conducts the annual land value survey, said the market appeared fundamentally sound and that land prices were responding properly to high crop prices. "If you've got good ground, it's worth a lot of money," he said.
Bruce Brock, the broker who sold the farm to the Freking brothers, exudes an optimism that would sound familiar to anyone who bought a home in 2006. "If you look from the beginning of farming in the United States to now, the long-term trend has been up," he said. "There will be market fluctuations where it will go down. But in 10 years, I won't be surprised if our $10,000 land is $20,000."

Abstract: If interest rates rise, private banks are likely to respond by pushing up their own mortgage and deposit account rates, crimping spending power for many consumers but benefiting savers. The euro climbed after Mr. Trichet's comments, rising to $1.3959 late in the day in New York, from $1.3860 late Wednesday, as investors anticipated higher returns on euro zone securities relative to those in the United States, Britain and Japan, where interest rates of central banks remained below 1 percent.

Full text: The European Central Bank signaled Thursday that it could raise interest rates as soon as next month in response to intensifying inflationary pressures. Such a move would be likely to lead soon to higher borrowing costs for homeowners and businesses.
An interest rate increase would be the first by a top central bank to prevent the recent effects of higher oil and food prices from spreading into the broader economy. But it could add to the troubles of countries like Ireland, Greece and Portugal and, if continued, would probably further weaken Europe's economic growth prospects this year.
"An increase of interest rates in the next meeting is possible," Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the central bank, said Thursday at a news conference in Frankfurt. The next policy meeting on setting rates is set for April 7.
If interest rates rise, private banks are likely to respond by pushing up their own mortgage and deposit account rates, crimping spending power for many consumers but benefiting savers.
Mr. Trichet emphasized, however, that such an increase was "not certain" and that it should not be seen as "the start of a series of interest rate increases."
The comments surprised most analysts, who had not expected that the bank would raise rates until later in the year. They had expected it to announce that it would scale back some of its temporary measures intended to provide added liquidity for struggling banks.
"This is about as clear a signal of a rate hike that you are going to see from a central banker," said Nick Kounis, head of economics at ABN Amro in Amsterdam. "The E.C.B. is once again living up to its reputation as a single-minded inflation fighter."
Earlier, the bank decided to leave its benchmark rate at 1 percent, the record low it has held since May 2009. Mr. Trichet said that the decision was unanimous.
The euro climbed after Mr. Trichet's comments, rising to $1.3959 late in the day in New York, from $1.3860 late Wednesday, as investors anticipated higher returns on euro zone securities relative to those in the United States, Britain and Japan, where interest rates of central banks remained below 1 percent.
The central bank has a narrow mandate focusing on inflation, unlike the Federal Reserve, which has a mission that includes the "pursuit of maximum employment."
The E.C.B.'s official comfort zone for inflation is just below 2 percent. Yet annual inflation in the euro zone hit 2.4 percent in February, its highest level since October 2008 and up from 2.3 percent in January, according to estimates this week from Eurostat, the European statistics agency.
Recent increases in commodity prices, notably oil -- the benchmark Brent crude futures contract has risen more than 20 percent this year -- suggest to many analysts that inflation has further to rise.
Food prices are also climbing. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations said Thursday in Rome that its food price index was up 2.2 percent last month from January, reaching the highest level in inflation-adjusted and nominal terms since the agency started monitoring prices two decades ago. Higher food prices have been a factor behind unrest in North Africa and the Middle East, which in turn has pushed oil prices higher.
Mr. Trichet said that the recent increase in inflation largely reflected commodity prices and that there had not yet been evidence of its passing through to wages. "It is essential that the recent rise in inflation does not give rise to broad-based inflationary pressures over the medium term," he said. "Strong vigilance is warranted with a view to containing upside risks to price stability."
While the central bank is acting against cost pressures, there is still evidence that economic activity in the region is patchy. Eurostat confirmed this week that growth was slower than expected in the fourth quarter of 2010. Gross domestic product in the euro zone, which had 16 countries in 2010, grew 0.3 percent in the fourth quarter compared with figures in the third quarter.
The three biggest economies -- Germany, France and Italy -- expanded more slowly than expected. Some countries like Portugal and Greece are still contracting, saddled by debt and lacking competitiveness relative to their peers.
Mr. Trichet responded by saying, "Our responsibility is for 331 million people."
Those representing consumers and unions expressed frustration at the central bank announcement.
"The dynamics set in motion by a hike will cause problems," said Ronald Janssen, chief economist the European Trade Union Confederation. A rate increase appears logical for Germany, where growth is solid and unemployment is falling, he added, but not for Ireland, Spain and Greece, where consumers are struggling under the pressure of tough austerity policies, higher oil prices and low wage settlements.
"It highlights a fundamental problem for the euro zone, that monetary policy is not adequate for all its members," Mr. Janssen said. "The real question that needs to be addressed is how to go toward a fiscal union. But politicians are trying to avoid it."
Several members of the central bank's governing council have been sounding the alarm about acting quickly and decisively against inflation. One possible successor to Mr. Trichet after his retirement at the end of October -- Mario Draghi of the Bank of Italy -- has himself issued such warnings recently.
Most analysts now expect the bank to raise rates by a quarter of a percentage point next month. "Mr. Trichet seems to be suggesting that monetary tightening can be gradual in the coming months," Mr. Kounis of ABN Amro said. "The message seems to be that an early start does not necessarily imply a more aggressive tightening cycle."
Still, there is no guarantee of that. Around the turn of 2006, the central bank made similar statements of caution but then proceeded to push rates up by two percentage points over the next 18 months.

Abstract: Many recommend that you set aside at least 10 percent of your income. [...] knowing how lackadaisical millions of Americans are about saving for retirement -- and acknowledging that many are struggling just to make ends meet -- many retirement specialists are urging Washington to create a savings vehicle, sometimes called an automatic individual retirement account or guaranteed retirement account, that would supplement Social Security and require workers (and perhaps employers) to contribute several percentage points of employee earnings.

Full text: JEFF NELSON, a manager in the Utah Health Department, says he constantly scolds himself for not setting aside more for retirement. "It's always there, like that squeaky screen door in back that you want to fix , but you never get to," said Mr. Nelson, 40, the father of a 10-year-old and 7 -year-old. "I feel I have more pressing needs. I have to make the house payment. I have to make the car payment."
"I know you're supposed to save more for retirement," he added, "but I haven't even started saving for college for my kids."
Mr. Nelson, a state employee, may be a couple of decades from retirement, but he is in line to receive a pension someday, and that alone puts him in better shape that many Americans. But as he well knows, it is not likely to be enough. Sad to say, people of Mr. Nelson's generation, the baby boomers' children -- in their 20s, 30s and 40s -- are likely to have an even rougher retirement than their parents, many economists say.
And for the baby boomers themselves, retirement may not seem so rosy as it once did.
This year, the first of the nation's 79 million baby boomers turn 65, and while millions dream of comfortable retirements, perhaps in Boca Raton, Fla., or Palm Springs, Calif., many will discover they will have a tough time in retirement.
"The baby boomers will be the first generation that will do worse in retirement than their parents," said Teresa Ghilarducci, an economics professor and retirement specialist at the New School for Social Research in New York. "And the next generation of retirees will do a lot worse; they fall off a cliff," largely because so few of them will have the traditional pensions that many of their parents and grandparents had.
Americans planning to retire in five to 10 years could see their golden years tarnished by a confluence of circumstances, including depressed housing prices, soaring health costs and a fitful stock market that has pummeled 401(k) plans. Not only that, company after company has frozen or eliminated its pension plan, and many members of Congress are pushing to scale back Social Security benefits -- even though half of the nation's retirees receive at least 90 percent of their income from Social Security. Its benefits average $14,000 a year. So perhaps it should not be surprising that 45 percent of America's baby boomers are "at risk," without enough to maintain their living standards after they retire, according to the nation's leading center on retirement studies, the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College.
Even one development that might seem to be good news -- longer life spans -- could worsen retirement woes, because more and more people will live for years after they have spent their nest eggs. For couples retiring now, the chances are 50 percent that one member will live to 92.
But don't rush to press the panic button, retirement specialists say. Smart planning -- and aggressive saving -- can go far to ensure a comfortable retirement. Whether you are 29 or 59, put far more into your retirement accounts, they say. Many recommend that you set aside at least 10 percent of your income.
And knowing how lackadaisical millions of Americans are about saving for retirement -- and acknowledging that many are struggling just to make ends meet -- many retirement specialists are urging Washington to create a savings vehicle, sometimes called an automatic individual retirement account or guaranteed retirement account, that would supplement Social Security and require workers (and perhaps employers) to contribute several percentage points of employee earnings.
If you have already retired, there are strategies to help make your retirement years more prosperous and secure. Buying an annuity can ensure you a steady income stream until the day you die, above and beyond Social Security. Some advisers also recommend that people 62 and older consider reverse mortgages, though they often offer less money than several years ago because of the decline in housing values.
Another increasingly popular, if unloved, strategy to consider is semiretirement, taking a part-time job or starting a small business to ensure an adequate income.
"No one wants to say longevity is a problem, but you have to finance your retirement for a longer period of time," said David Certner, the legislative policy director for AARP. "We certainly encourage people to continue working that extra year or two. That means not only are you not drawing down for an extra year or two, but you're building up your assets another year or two."
Phyllis Kaplan, of Highland Park, Ill., began receiving early Social Security payments last August, at 63, because she had lost her job as a graphic designer for a publishing house. She rolled over money from her 401(k) into an I.R.A., but she said that still left her without enough income, even with $1,200 in monthly Social Security benefits.
So Ms. Kaplan started working 10 days a month in a bead shop, making use of her artistic flair.
"I realized I had to continue working because I can't pay my bills," said Ms. Kaplan, who has been divorced for 24 years. "I have no pension, and I have to buy health insurance, and this job is helping me develop more of a nest egg." She noted that Social Security would cut her benefits if she worked more each month.
A new report by McKinsey & Company, the consulting firm, is gloomy about retirement. The report, Restoring Americans' Retirement Security: A Shared Responsibility, says, "The average American family faces a 37 percent shortfall in the income they will need in retirement," meaning "the average household will face a retirement savings shortfall of nearly $250,000 by the time of retirement.
"Even before the financial crisis that began in the fall of 2008," causing 401(k) plans to tumble, "Americans were woefully unprepared for retirement."
Households in the 60-to-65 age group with incomes of $100,000 to $250,000 a year face a 20 percent shortfall in the income needed to maintain their living standards at retirement, the report says, while households 40 to 59 in that income bracket face a 28 percent shortfall.
For households with incomes of $50,000 to $100,000, McKinsey found, those 60 to 65 face a 10 percent gap in the income needed to maintain their living standards in retirement, but those 40 to 59 in that income group face a 37 percent shortfall.
The shortfalls are even larger for those 30 to 39. The McKinsey report says that group faces the biggest challenge, but "they have the greatest ability to recover by changing their behaviors." "This group," the report says, "must rely almost entirely on personal savings" because the payouts from traditional defined-benefit pensions "will provide one-tenth of the retirement income of their parents' generation."
At 76, Peter Sonders has some strong retirement advice for younger Americans. A longtime lab technician at an Anheuser-Busch Brewery, Mr. Sonders lives comfortably in retirement in Williamsburg, Va., although he worked 27 years for Rheingold, a beer company that went bankrupt, causing his pension there to wither to $88 a month. Still, Mr. Sonders boasts that he has managed to put together a solid retirement in a way, he says, that many others can.
"The strategy I would recommend is, you have to save 'till it hurts, because even your regular pension plan can go up in smoke," said Mr. Sonders, who used to be a trustee on union pension funds. "So save as much as you can, well over 10 percent a year. And don't speculate too much in what you're investing. And if you ever get a raise, don't spend the raise, keep saving it and you usually won't miss it."
Retirement specialists say a cascade of unhappy factors has dimmed retirement prospects:

Social Security benefits will replace just 28 percent of a recipient's preretirement income in 2030, on average, down from 39 percent in 2002, according to the Center on Retirement Research. The drop will result largely from the increased Medicare payments and higher income taxes Social Security recipients will have to pay.
Financial planners generally recommend that retirement income be 65 percent to 80 percent of preretirement income to avoid a drop in living standards. Social Security recipients face that decline even without more cuts Congress may make to address the system's long-term financing problems. One idea is to raise the age for full benefits to 69.

Low interest rates have translated into paltry yields for many bonds and retirement accounts, making it harder to live off interest alone (although low inflation helps keep pensions and savings accounts from eroding).

Not only do fewer than half of private-sector workers participate in a pension or 401(k) plan, but corporations are moving more workers from traditional pensions to the considerably less generous 401(k). At the same time, public-sector workers, many of whom still have generous defined-benefit pensions, are seeing those plans come under attack in New Jersey, Wisconsin and other states.
Jack VanDerhei, research director of the Employee Benefit Research Institute, said, "Unless you're one of the 40 to 50 percent of the private-sector work force that's lucky enough to work for an employer that's sponsoring a retirement plan, the probability that you'll end up with sufficient money for retirement is de minimis."

Even many Americans with 401(k) plans face problems because workers have a median of about $30,000 in their accounts, while the 55-to-64 age group just before retirement has a median of $78,000, not much to live on in addition to Social Security if you retire at 65 and live 20 more years. As a result of the stock market's slide during the recession, 401(k) plans lost $2.8 trillion in value, tumbling by more than 40 percent -- though Wall Street's recent rise has allowed them to recoup more than half that loss.
Alicia H. Munnell, director of the Center on Retirement Research at Boston College, said 401(k) plans were far from ideal for retirement, not least because they are so complicated and many Americans have little investment expertise. Workers, she said, have to decide whether to join their employer's plan, how much to contribute, how to invest their contributions, when to rebalance, what to do about company stock, whether to roll over accumulations when changing jobs and how to withdraw the money in retirement.
"Every step along the way, a significant fraction of participants make serious mistakes," she said.
Retirement specialists are overflowing with advice about what to do to prevent a drop in living standards.
For wealthy as well as many middle-class Americans, Mr. VanDerhei, said, "Any overall rule of thumb I give would be silly, but I plead with people, before you retire please go see somebody, please spend a couple of hundred dollars to see a financial planner to discuss the correct drawdown strategy, annuitization and other matters."
Mr. VanDerhei said annuities were an excellent idea for many people, though using all one's retirement savings for an annuity "doesn't make sense for a lot of people." He also urged people to seriously consider long-term care insurance to help protect against nursing home costs wiping out their savings.
Whether you are wealthy or middle class, retirement specialists emphasize the importance of rebalancing your financial assets as you grow older, moving a higher percentage out of equities and into less volatile investments.
While Americans in their 20s and 30s are not saving nearly enough for retirement, many specialists agree, they see one optimistic sign -- two-fifths of the 401(k) balances of new hires is being placed in balanced funds, including target-date funds, those that invest based on when an employee plans to retire, to help provide protection from sudden market volatility.
Recognizing that many 401(k) investors rarely change their own asset allocations, specialists recommend target-date funds because the fund managers reallocate the funds toward less risky investments as workers age.
For moderate- and low-income Americans, retirement specialists emphasize the importance of saving as much as you can, although those Americans have the least ability to put money aside.
"Basically, people don't save on their own," Ms. Munnell said. "They only save through organized institutional mechanisms. Lecturing people to save doesn't work."
The Pension Protection Act of 2006 created incentives for more companies to funnel all their employees into 401(k) plans, but many small businesses have not done so, leaving millions of workers without retirement plans.
Some retirement specialists and advocacy groups, noting that one-third of retirees get 100 percent of their retirement income from Social Security, often just $14,000 a year, say more needs to be done to help low- and moderate-income retirees.
Karen Friedman, executive vice president for the Pension Rights Center, a nonprofit group, is urging Congress to create what are often called guaranteed retirement accounts, to which employees and employers would contribute, with each giving perhaps 3 percent of an employee's pay. She also said the federal government should provide a tax subsidy to give workers, especially low-income ones, an incentive to contribute.
"Congress," Ms. Friedman said, "shouldn't be focusing on cutting Social Security -- that's the part of the retirement system that works best -- but on strengthening the private side of the system to make sure everyone has adequate and secure benefits for retirement."
But many business groups, as well as Mr. VanDerhei's institute, oppose requiring employers to contribute 2 percent or 3 percent as part of such a system, arguing that companies already face plenty of government mandates.
Professor Ghilarducci had frank if unpleasant advice about how Americans might deal with the looming problem of saving too little to maintain their living standards in retirement.
Asserting that millions of people have been overspenders who have lived beyond their means, she said: "People do need to save more money for retirement. Unless changes are made to give people better pensions, my advice is to ratchet down your living standards, so when you have less money during retirement you won't be so disappointed."

Full text: TARGET-DATE fund managers are not saying so outright, but they have apparently learned a lesson from the 2008 market collapse and the furious reaction of many 401(k) investors. Now, the fund managers are de-emphasizing stocks and adding investments that are more diversified, less likely to make sharp moves and more likely to provide a steady income.
Those changes could mean fewer heart-stopping plunges in account values -- and fewer angry investors -- after the next bad market.
"There's clearly a goal to minimize volatility risk," said David L. Wray, president of the Profit Sharing/401(k) Council of America, a trade group in Chicago.
Target-date funds, which follow a programmed strategy based on the investor's expected retirement date, have become extremely popular since the early 2000s. More than 80 percent of 401(k) plans now offer them, according to Aon Hewitt, a consultancy in Lincolnshire, Ill.
Investors have seen them as a safe haven, because each fund creates what is known as a glide path, a mix of stocks, fixed-income instruments and other investments that gradually and automatically shifts money from stocks into less risky assets as the investor approaches the planned retirement date.
When the markets tumbled in 2008, many investors who had hoped to retire in the next few years were shocked to learn that at a number of funds, far more of their money than expected -- typically half of the assets -- was in stocks. Rather than being a haven, the average 2010 fund -- aimed at people expecting to retire around 2010 -- fell 24.6 percent in the downslide.
Congress, the Labor Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission held hearings on the funds' marketing and investment strategies, and the Labor Department is now considering new rules for disclosure.
The managers insist that all the investor and government uproar has not affected their strategies; they note that their glide paths have changed little or not at all since 2008. Vanguard Group still keeps 68 percent of the assets in stocks 10 years before the target date, downshifting to 50 percent at the target date.
But what has changed are the kinds of securities that go into the categories of equities and fixed income.
First, the funds have added investments that are supposed to protect against inflation, usually because their returns or underlying values go up when inflation does. The most common of these investments are special Treasury bonds whose principal and interest are indexed to inflation, known as Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS; real estate investment trusts, or REITs; and various ways of investing in commodities like oil, natural gas and metals.
This latter category might include stocks of companies in those industries, limited partnerships in oil pipelines, investments in hedge funds that specialize in these areas, index funds tied to a commodities index and direct purchases of the commodities.
Some target-date managers are also trying high-yield bonds, bonds from developing countries, infrastructure projects and stocks that emphasize dividends over returns.
Although inflation may be low today, target-date funds seek inflation protection because they must look decades ahead. A secondary goal is to make investments that can produce a steady flow of returns, almost like a traditional pension, once the employees retire.
"People are relying on these strategies to provide them with income for life," said Jonathan Shelon, one of the two portfolio managers overseeing Fidelity Investments' Freedom Funds, which has put in TIPS and a commodities index fund. "But there's no assurance that a traditional combination of stocks, bonds and cash is going to give you that inflation protection."
The other big change is adding more international stocks. Within the last year and a half, Fidelity and Vanguard, the two largest 401(k) managers, have raised their international allocations to 30 percent of their total stock holdings from 20 percent, an increase that experts say is typical.
In themselves, these new investments bring more stability to the target-date funds. But their impact is doubled, because the money that goes into them must come from somewhere else.
If a manager is simply switching from one type of stock, of a company in the United States to another that is international, there is little impact. Often, however, money will be taken out of equities to go into commodities, high-yield bonds and REITs. Because these investments have some qualities similar to stocks, particularly in the short term and during times of stability, they are classified as such in the glide path. Nevertheless, a high-yield bond or a stake in an oil pipeline is quite different from a stock.
"It's definitely de-emphasizing equities," said David O'Meara, an investment consultant at Towers Watson, a consulting firm based in New York City.
Brian Abshire, a senior analyst at Hewitt EnnisKnupp, Aon Hewitt's investment consulting subsidiary, commented, "With the addition of a larger international participation and more TIPS, commodities and inflation-hedging strategies, it lowers the volatility, especially near retirement."
The Principal Financial Group in Des Moines, another big 401(k) manager, has also added inflation-hedging and income-producing investments to the retail version of its target-date funds. "There was certainly panic in 2008, and I'm positive some of that has helped with the sales here," said Randy L. Welch, the director of investment services at Principal.
One thing that is not changing significantly, fund managers and outside experts say, is the cost. Even though funds in esoteric categories like international stocks and commodities usually charge higher fees than those in American stocks and bonds, that is far outweighed by the lower fees that 401(k) plans are often able to negotiate. At most, experts say, target-date fees may inch up one to three basis points (0.01 to 0.03 percent).
Mr. Wray of the Profit Sharing/401(k) Council of America said most investors were probably not paying much attention to these alterations. After all, that is the whole point of target-date funds. "These are the ultimate passive investments," he said.

Abstract: WITH stock prices advancing smartly -- both the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index have gained more than 22 percent in the last six months -- retirees who fled to the safety of money market funds and savings accounts when the market plunged in 2008 and 2009 may well want to move some assets back into stocks.

Full text: WITH stock prices advancing smartly -- both the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index have gained more than 22 percent in the last six months -- retirees who fled to the safety of money market funds and savings accounts when the market plunged in 2008 and 2009 may well want to move some assets back into stocks.
"It is absolutely time to be in equities," said Jason T. Thomas, chief investment officer of Aspiriant, a fee-only wealth management firm with offices in San Francisco and Los Angeles. "Over time, fixed income is going to underperform vis-a-vis equities" by three to five percentage points, he predicted.
Chris Leavy, chief investment officer of United States managed equity portfolios for BlackRock Inc., the world's largest investment management firm, pointed to long life expectancies as a reason that stocks are "a compelling investment compared to fixed income."
For a couple, both age 65, "there is a 50 percent chance that at least one will make it to 92," he said.
"Investors nearing or in retirement should feel comfortable investing up to 50 percent of their portfolios in dividend-paying equities," Mr. Leavy added. Equity valuations today are still attractive, he said, despite the markets' recent rise. Historically, he said, dividends have grown faster than inflation, especially in European markets.
BlackRock, which sells mutual funds through financial advisers, has two dividend funds, the BlackRock Equity Dividend Fund and the BlackRock Global Dividend Income Fund, both of which have outperformed their peer group.
Both men and other advisers interviewed emphasized the need for careful risk management and diversification.
Hans Olsen, chief investment officer of JPMorgan's private client services, went so far as to say, "It's not about getting the most on the upside -- it's about limiting the downside." If a portfolio loses 25 percent of its value, he noted, it will have to gain 33 percent to get back to the starting point.
Dividend-paying stocks in developed markets in the United States and Europe "look particularly fetching for retirees now," he said, with potential for both capital appreciation and income. "Long-term bonds are not a good idea now because of where interest rates are likely to go," he added, meaning that as rates rise, the market value of the bonds will fall.
Dr. Thomas, who has a doctorate in economics, said that "equity returns in any given year are impossible to predict," so he offered a hedging strategy to limit risk.
Here is how it works: A retiree puts $100,000 into an exchange traded fund replicating the S.& P. 500. Then, he said, the investor could buy a put option to limit his loss in the unexpected event of a market plunge.
"It would cost about $1,800 to ensure that the portfolio is worth at least $80,000 through the option's expiration date" of Dec. 17, he said, so, if the market indeed rose 8 percent, an investor who has spent $1,800, or 1.8 percent, for a put would have a net return of 6 percent, still far more than he would have had in money markets or short-term notes.
The strategy can also be used for iShares for the Russell 3000 Index Fund, the MSCI EAFE Index Fund and the MSCI Emerging Markets Index Fund.
Alternatively, he said, a number of mutual funds use options to manage risk, including the Gateway Fund, which in 2008 had a negative total return of 13.92 percent, not nearly so bad as the S.& P. 500, which had a negative 37 percent return. But the Gateway Fund's gains this year have been less than half that of the index, reflecting the cost of protecting the downside.
Christopher Zander, a partner and wealth adviser with Evercore Wealth Management in New York, favors broadly diversified retirement portfolios, including market hedges like gold and other commodities, bonds from Australia, Brazil and Norway, and Treasury inflation protected securities, known as TIPS.
In equities, he likes large-capitalization, dividend-paying domestic stocks and emerging markets issues for which he uses an E.T.F. for the WisdomTree Emerging Markets Equity Income Fund.
Mr. Zander cautioned against holding any concentrated stock position, which many retired executives have in the companies where they worked. Once they are no longer with the company, they should diversify away from "single-event risks," he said.
The first step in building a retirement portfolio, Mr. Zander said, is to identify your cash-flow needs and your long-term goals. Then put together a portfolio that will provide the growth and income to meet those needs and goals, provided it does not entail more risk than you are willing to accept.
"If a conservative portfolio can meet your income goals and legacy goals," he said, you can avoid unnecessary risk. On the other hand, "if you have a couple of good years," when your portfolio outperforms, "be mindful to set some aside" for the leaner years, he said.
Alexander Godwin, global head of asset allocation and managing director for Citi Private Bank, said a conservative portfolio might have 20 percent in equities, 8 percent in cash, 9 percent in hedge funds, 30 percent in corporate fixed income and the rest in Treasuries, municipal and supranational bonds.
A moderate-risk portfolio, in Mr. Godwin's model, would have 48 percent in equities, 17 percent in hedge funds, 18 percent in corporate fixed income and the rest in government issues.
A more aggressive one would have 64 percent in equities, 21 percent in hedge funds, 8.5 percent in corporate fixed income and the rest in government issues.
One way to put a reliable floor under current income, so there is less cause for anxiety over the inevitable ups and downs of long-term equity investments, is to put a portion of a retirement portfolio into an income annuity.
Michael J. Gordon, senior vice president of the New York Life Insurance Company, the largest provider of income annuities, said, "When you're working, you effectively have an income annuity -- your job." When people retire, they can replace their paychecks by putting a chunk of their liquid assets, typically 20 percent to 30 percent, into an annuity.
The first step is to figure out how much you need each month for living expenses in retirement, then subtract any Social Security and pension payments you might receive to see how much you would need to cover the difference.
A 65-year-old man who bought a $100,000 annuity from New York Life would receive $577.51 a month for life. The monthly payment would be $549.55 if he bought an annuity with a guarantee that if he died before all the payments received equaled the initial premium amount, his estate would get a refund for the difference.
Couples can buy joint policies, and a variety of secondary guarantees are available, like inflation protection or emergency provisions, Mr. Gordon said, but each additional guarantee would reduce the monthly payment.
The approach at Bank of America Merrill Lynch is to divide retirees' assets into three portfolios, one for short-term consumption needs, the second for longer-term investments and the third for savings and investments that are intended to create legacies.
The short-term portfolio may include annuities or high-quality fixed-income assets to generate regular cash flows over a two- to seven-year period, but not equities, said Thomas Latta, managing director, investment management and guidance, for Merrill Lynch Global Wealth. Over time, assets may be transferred from the intermediate portfolio, which is diversified across most major asset classes, including equities and fixed income, and is intended to keep pace with inflation.
The third portfolio may also include real estate and specialty assets, as well as alternative investments.
"Don't look at it as once and done," said David Tyrie, head of personal retirement solutions for the company, adding that a portfolio "is a living, breathing thing" that needs careful attention.

Full text: Economic activity in the United States expanded at a "modest to moderate" pace in the early part of the year, as retail sales and manufacturing grew in all but a few regions of the country, according to a survey of the Federal Reserve's 12 districts released on Wednesday.
In the central bank survey of economic activity, compiled in what is called the beige book, severe winter weather affected some aspects of the pace of economic activity.
The report also said that labor markets improved modestly across the country, although there were differences in the types of jobs. Some regions noted stronger growth in temporary jobs while others saw an expansion in permanent positions.
"Reports from the 12 Federal Reserve Districts indicated that overall economic activity continued to expand at a modest to moderate pace in January and early February," the beige book said. It later added: "Labor market conditions continued to strengthen modestly, with all districts reporting some degree of improvement."
The report suggested a benign context for any tightening by the Fed of monetary policy at the moment. The next meeting of its policy-making arm is on March 15.
Gregory Daco, the senior United States economist for IHS Global Insight, said he did not expect any change in the Fed's monetary policy at the meeting.
"This overall upbeat report underlines that the economy has picked up momentum in early 2011," he said.
Separately, the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said in testimony before Congress on Wednesday that he was still not satisfied with the strength of the economic rebound.
"The economy's recovery is not firmly established, and we think monetary policy needs to be supportive," Mr. Bernanke said in semiannual testimony to the House Financial Services Committee.
Responding to a question, Mr. Bernanke said that the Fed's policy of keeping its benchmark rate near zero for an "extended period" helped provide support to the economy, "which in our judgment, it still needs."
He also said that a House Republican plan to cut $61 billion in federal spending this year could cost around 200,000 jobs over two years.
The beige book report compiles anecdotal evidence that touched on some of the sectors central to the pace of the recovery. Retail sales increased in all the districts with the exception of Richmond, Va., and Atlanta, while in some regions in the East, like Boston and New York, sales were hampered by severe weather.
The report covered the period from Jan. 3 through Feb. 18. A recurring theme in the survey was the impact that severe weather had on a range of economic activity. A manufacturer in the Minneapolis district's Upper Peninsula region reported that severe weather delayed a construction expansion, and it hit the transportation sector in the Atlanta district.
Weather also disrupted some agricultural production in many districts. Exceptionally dry conditions along with extended periods of below-freezing temperatures hurt the vegetable crop in Texas, greatly stressed livestock and necessitated increased supplemental feeding, the report said. Farmers had to break ice to water their livestock in Richmond, where cold weather lowered farm income and slowed development of winter wheat.
Weather also affected retail sales and significantly reduced automobile sales in early February in the Dallas district. Severe winter weather also had some impact on retail spending in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta and Kansas City, the report said.
The manufacturing sector registered solid growth in all districts except for St. Louis, which noted a decline because of the closing of several factories, including those in tire manufacturing, wood products, automobile parts, aircraft and primary metal manufacturing industries. In real estate and housing, the overall level of home sales and construction remained low, the report said, but it noted some improvement in commercial real estate.
Compared with the conditions in the previous period, there appeared to be a tightening of credit conditions. Such standards were reported in most of the districts as "unchanged to tighter."
Higher commodity and oil prices were having an effect on input costs, which increased for manufacturers and retailers in most districts, while the ability to pass on those costs to consumers varied.
The report also said wage pressures remained minimal throughout the 12 districts.
"If that becomes more prevalent, then the Fed begins to worry that inflation pressure is building," said John Canally, economist for LPL Financial. "It is sort of a red flag."
"The Fed is going to be extra vigilant about letting the inflation genie out of the bottle," said Mr. Canally. But if subsequent reports note that wage pressures are building, he said, "that would be a precursor to a rate hike."

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Oil prices are rising. Housing prices are falling. But the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, told Congress on Tuesday that neither issue was likely to derail renewed growth.
There is growing confidence among policy makers here that the economy is making headway, and that Americans still suffering the lingering effects of the 2008 financial crisis will soon start to feel the benefits.
"We have seen increased evidence that a self-sustaining recovery in consumer and business spending may be taking hold," Mr. Bernanke said in testimony before the Senate Banking Committee. He added, however, that "until we see a sustained period of stronger job creation, we cannot consider the recovery to be truly established."
The remarks by Mr. Bernanke, which have been echoed by other officials, place the central bank chairman in the position of telling Americans that things are better than they seem. The Obama administration, privately optimistic but publicly committed to sympathizing when it talks about the economy, said last week that growth is "not happening fast enough."
Mr. Bernanke also finds himself on a political tightrope. The Fed is engaged in a vast and unprecedented effort to stimulate growth by buying hundreds of billions of dollars in federal debt, helping to hold down the cost of borrowing.
Republicans worry that the Fed is overstimulating the economy, and they see evidence in the signs of growth that it is time to start fighting inflation by cutting back.
"Once price stability has been lost, it's difficult and very costly to regain," Senator Richard Shelby, Republican of Alabama, said Tuesday, invoking the 1980s.
Democrats, however, are concerned that the Fed may claim victory prematurely. The stock market is rising, but 9 percent of the work force still cannot find jobs.
"As the economy continues to struggle to recover, we should be using every tool in the toolbox to create jobs and spur growth," Senator Tim Johnson, a Democrat from South Dakota who is chairman of the banking committee, said in introducing Mr. Bernanke.
The Fed chief said that he remained more concerned that the recovery would falter than that inflation would sneak up on the central bank.
He said that both the Fed and independent experts estimated that inflation would remain modest -- at around 2 percent -- through 2013, as the economy recovered from the recession.
And he said it was too soon to decide what approach the Fed should take after its current round of purchases -- a total of $600 billion -- wraps up at the end of June.
"Over the next few months we'll be able to make a judgment about whether this economy has enough strength to move ahead on its own," Mr. Bernanke said.
Mr. Bernanke also tried to ease concerns about increases in the price of oil and other basic commodities like wheat, steel and sugar. He said that a sustained rise in oil prices could be a threat to the economy, but that the probable outcome of the higher prices was a temporary and modest increase in consumer inflation.
The reason is that American consumers spend most of their money on finished products, not basic commodities. The cost of wheat, in other words, is a relatively small factor in determining what a supermarket charges for a box of sugared cereal.
Other experts, however, believe the rise in commodity prices is already a cause for concern. Dan Greenhaus, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak & Company, an institutional stock trading firm, said that commodity prices remained an important leading indicator of inflation, and he said that Mr. Bernanke also was sanguine about rising housing prices during the credit boom.
"Bernanke runs the risk of appearing too Pollyannaish yet again in the face of changing fundamentals," he wrote in a note to clients today after Mr. Bernanke's remarks.
Mr. Bernanke travels to Capitol Hill twice a year to testify about the Fed's management of the economy. Inevitably, members of Congress ask the nation's economist-in-chief to weigh in on the financial aspects of other issues.
He told senators that the federal deficit is the nation's greatest long-term challenge. But he rebuffed several attempts by Republicans to secure his support for the proposition that Congress should not raise the debt ceiling -- the maximum amount that the government can borrow -- without a plan to reduce the debt.
The government may hit the current ceiling, now set at $14.3 trillion, next month.
Mr. Bernanke said that the government needed to pay its debts and then reduce future spending. "Not increasing the debt limit is like saying, you know, we're going to solve our family's financial problems by refusing to pay our credit card bills," he said.
Failure to do so, he said, "would almost certainly create a new financial crisis."
Mr. Bernanke said that a Republican plan to cut federal spending by $61 billion would likely reduce economic output by "several tenths" of one percent. He said that studies cited by some Democrats that project a 2 percent reduction were overstated.
Also Tuesday, the San Francisco Fed named John C. Williams as its new president. He succeeds Janet Yellen, who was appointed by President Obama to the Board of Governors. Mr. Williams, an economist, previously served as the director of research for the San Francisco Fed. He worked during the Clinton administration for the president's council of economic advisers.

Full text: The major indexes slid on Tuesday, sending the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index to its first decline in three days, as concern that rising energy costs will hurt the economic recovery overshadowed the fastest manufacturing growth since 2004.
Alcoa and Titanium Metals fell at least 3.7 percent as crude oil rose above $99 a barrel amid escalating unrest in the Middle East and northern Africa. Fifth Third Bancorp dropped 4.5 percent after receiving a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission for information on commercial loans. The Carnival Corporation slid 6.1 percent after the chief operating officer of the cruise line operator sold 180,000 shares.
The S.& P. 500 slipped 20.89 points, or 1.57 percent, to 1,306.33. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 168.32 points, or 1.38 percent, to 12,058.02, while the Nasdaq declined 44.86, or 1.61 percent, to 2,737.41.
"Anyone who thinks that a year from now we're going to look at the Middle East and see nothing but candy and roses, that's not going to happen," said Stanley A. Nabi, a vice chairman for the Silvercrest Asset Management Group in New York. "Manufacturing, the overall U.S. economy, is doing well. Still, that geopolitical situation will be an overhang."
Stocks erased an earlier advance after crude oil extended gains amid concern unrest would spread from Libya to Iran. Oil climbed as much as 1.9 percent as authorities in Iran, one of the largest producers in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, arrested opposition leaders to derail demonstrations.
The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, testifying to the Senate Banking Committee in Washington, said the surge in oil probably would not cause a permanent increase in inflation and repeated that interest rates were likely to stay low. His comments suggest the Fed will stay on course to complete $600 billion of Treasury purchases through June in an effort to suppress borrowing costs and safeguard the economic recovery.
"Bernanke's reiterating that the Fed's going to stay on the path they're on," said Joseph Veranth, chief investment officer at Dana Investment Advisors in Brookfield, Wis., which manages $2.8 billion. "That leaves room for inflation concerns to continue to worry the market."
Interest rates were lower. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 8/32, to 101 30/32, and the yield fell to 3.39 percent from 3.42 percent late Monday.
The surge in oil overshadowed data showing that factories added workers and increased production in February, indicating momentum for the expansion. The Institute for Supply Management's factory index increased to 61.4, the highest since May 2004, from 60.8 in January. Readings greater than 50 signal growth.
Alcoa, the largest aluminum producer in the United States, fell 3.7 percent to $16.23, the biggest decline in the Dow. Material stocks slid 2.3 percent, the biggest drop out of 10 groups in the S.& P. 500. Titanium Metals slumped 6.1 percent to $17.82.
Range Resources, a natural gas producer, slipped 7.3 percent to $50.34. The company said it would sell 52,000 acres in the Barnett Shale in Texas for $900 million.

Full text: HOUSTON -- Just when oil markets appeared to be calming, crude oil prices surged again on Tuesday as the potential for more oil shipment disruptions spread across the Middle East and North Africa.
With Libya's oil exports almost entirely halted for the last several days, renewed unrest in Oman, Iran and Iraq rattled oil traders. An interruption of shipments from any of those countries would further tighten oil supplies, even as Saudi Arabia has rushed to fill the vacuum of Libyan supplies by pumping more oil from its fields.
The worries about the oil supply rippled through other markets, with stock markets turning lower on concerns that the higher cost of energy would slow economic recovery.
Gold prices also surged on the latest reports, and indexes on Wall Street declined sharply, with the Dow Jones industrial average down more than 1.3 percent. The Saudi Arabian benchmark stock index fell 6.8 percent.
In the latest sign that the political contagion was spreading, demonstrators in Oman on Tuesday tried to block a major road leading to the industrial port town of Sohar. Protesters in recent days have set fire to at least one police station and two government office buildings in the normally stable Persian Gulf country, which is ruled by a family dynasty and is the largest non-OPEC oil producer in the Middle East.
"To have protests in Oman, which had previously been seen as a sleepy gulf kingdom, heightens concerns that nowhere is immune from the contagion affects," said Helima L. Croft, a director and senior geopolitical analyst at Barclays Capital. "Every day we seem to have a new country with a new problem."
Oman produces 860,000 barrels of oil daily, almost 1 percent of world supplies, and its production has been rising in recent years with investments from Royal Dutch Shell, BP, Repsol and other international companies. Its importance is magnified by the fact that its crude is of such quality that it can be blended by most refineries around the world, although most of its exports now go to China and Japan.
Oman straddles the Strait of Hormuz, a strategic route through which 40 percent of the world's oil tanker traffic crosses. On the other side of the strait lies Iran, another major producer, where there were reports on Tuesday that security forces had used tear gas to disperse protesters in Tehran. Iran, with approximately 10 percent of the world's oil reserves, exports about 3.7 million barrels a day.
The price of light sweet crude rose to $99.63 a barrel while Brent crude rose 3.24 percent to $115.42. Oil jumped above $100 a barrel in after-hours trading in New York. The national average price for a gallon of regular gasoline rose by nearly a penny on Tuesday to just over $3.37, which is 20 cents higher than a week ago.
In testimony on Capitol Hill, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said that it would take a sustained increase in oil prices to push up consumer inflation significantly and threaten the economy. "Currently the cost pressures from higher commodity prices are being offset by the stability in unit labor costs," he added.
The rising tensions across the region sent the Saudi Arabian stock market into a tailspin, with Saudi shares suffering the biggest daily decline in more than two years despite rising oil prices. The Saudi index fell 6.8 percent, to its lowest close since July 2009. Refiners around the world have been hoping that Iraq, as violence ebbed, would again become a major oil producer, with production stabilizing at 2.3 million barrels a day. But over the weekend rebels bombed the country's largest refinery, reducing the refinery's capacity to refine petroleum products by 75,000 barrels a day. The attack came less than three weeks after a terrorist attack on a pipeline leading to a second refinery north of Baghdad.
Greg Priddy, an oil analyst at the Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy, said it was "highly unlikely" that output in another major producer in the region would be shut off. But he said that markets were jittery because "if the Saudis are going to make up for the shortfall in Libya, their spare capacity is thinner."
He added, "Another major country going out completely would use most of their spare capacity, and that is really what the market is worried about."
Saudi Arabia has a total production capacity of 12.5 million barrels a day, and currently produces nine million barrels after increasing its output by several hundred thousand since the beginning of the year. Saudi officials say they are ready to pump what it takes to fill any supply gap, but much of its 3.5 million barrel excess capacity contains sour crudes that do not easily replace the Libyan sweet crude European refineries in particular desire to produce diesel. In Libya, major oil operations in the eastern part of the country remained under the control of rebel forces. While foreign operators withdrew most of their foreign workers, local Libyan employees can still produce some crude. Oil experts say at least one million of the country's 1.6 million barrels a day of production has been shut down.
Little if any oil can be shipped out of Libya because most ports were closed. Meanwhile, storage tanks were filling up rapidly. Oil traders said one major oil company cargo ship was supposed to berth this week, but no one was at the port to deliver an oil shipment, and shipping companies were reluctant to send ships into the Libyan ports.
Most fields in Libya are operated by a combination of the National Oil Company, which owns 50 percent of the fields, and international consortiums, which share the other half.
The Arabian Gulf Oil Company, the largest subsidiary of the Libya National Oil Corporation, claims it had broken off from its mother company. It said it would honor its contracts but would divert the funds to the opposition, not to Tripoli.
Arabian Gulf's Hamada field had been shut, and output at Nafoora, Sarir and Misla had dropped to under half of maximum capacity. The company was still exporting crude at the Tobruk terminal, according to a report by PFC Energy, a consulting firm, but Arabian Gulf has stated that with only sporadic loading operations, it could reach its maximum storage capacity within two weeks, even with the drastically reduced production levels.
Arabian Gulf officials "have claimed that the company's export revenues will no longer be controlled by its parent company," PFC Energy said in the report, "but have not been able to confirm how those revenues would be managed by the subsidiary or potentially channeled to Libya's opposition."
Eni, the Italian oil giant and largest foreign operator in Libya, evacuated most of its employees and their families last week. The company's fields were still producing 120,000 barrels a day of oil and natural gas, about half their capacity before the revolt began. The company declined to say which fields it had shut down and which were still in operation, citing safety concerns. Eni still has 21 Italian employees in Libya, a spokesman said.

Map Libya's Oil Exports: About 85 Percent of Libya's Oil Exports Went to Europe Last Year; 11 Percent Went to China and Only 3 Percent to the United States. But in Addition to 1.5 Million Barrels a Day in Petroleum Exports, the Country Sent 350 Billion Cubic Feet of Natural Gas to Europe, Mainly Through a Pipeline to Italy.

Re "Treat the Patient, Not the CT Scan" (Op-Ed, Feb. 27):
As Abraham Verghese so aptly puts it, technology at the bedside is too often supplanting the hands-on physical exam in medical practice. The many errors that follow are both predictable and potentially catastrophic in overlooking critical clues to diagnosis, unnecessary testing and exposure to radiation. The costs mount as we lose the patient amid the wiring.
There is as well a further distance imposed by technology, and this is the distance between two human hearts: the physician's and the patient's. Empathy and kindness take back seats to the printout. Yet rather than seeing this as an excess of technology, we might see it as a dearth of values.
If we value the emotional and spiritual aspects of our humanness, we will assure their constancy within medical practice. Critical to reforming our health care is the reassertion of these values, their reinsertion into practice and training, and reimbursement that reflects the time and attention needed to treat the patient in all of his or her humanity.

To the Editor:
Abraham Verghese presents a false choice. A good doctor does not shun medical technology; rather, she uses it to supplement, not supplant, her powers of reason. The physician who listens attentively to the history, lays his washed hands on the patient for a detailed exam yet always skips the high-tech tests is not a paragon of medical humanism; he is a Luddite who will harm people.
I for one do not want to go back to the days when hip fractures too small to be seen on X-ray were detected by stethoscope -- rotating the hip and listening for crunchy sounds. Give me an M.R.I. any day.

The writer is an orthopedic surgeon.

To the Editor:
Abraham Verghese focuses on medical education as the culprit for the overreliance on CT scans at the expense of a more hands-on approach. But there are also the economic incentives that drive doctors in that direction. The large medical group practice I use for my health care owns its own imaging center, and it is indeed a busy place.
I am covered by Medicare, and the paltry reimbursement rate for an office visit pales in comparison to that for scans. In my case, a recent colonoscopy led to a CT scan to explore an irregularity. It was negative, but found something "suspicious" in my lung.
The pulmonary specialist prescribed a PET scan. That, too, was negative, but I was then told to follow up with three more CT scans over the ensuing two years. This all adds up to an enormous radiation risk.
I decided to seek further medical counsel outside of the group. As a lay person, I am not in a position to evaluate recommended medical procedures. Nor do I want to wonder if profit motives shape those procedures.
Stanley Herz
Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., Feb. 27, 2011

To the Editor:
Abraham Verghese brings out some very important aspects of health care.
Physical diagnosis has become a lost art in this country. I do not blame technology for that loss.
Most doctors are afraid of being sued, and that results in scans and laboratory tests that may be remotely linked to the patient's condition. The easy accessibility of technology in the United States dumbs down the clinical methods that the doctors learned in medical schools.
Unless there is reform in the legal system, I am afraid that the situation that Dr. Verghese complains of will only get worse along with a huge waste in health care dollars.

The writer is an oncologist at the Norval K. Morey Cancer Center.

To the Editor:
I appreciate Abraham Verghese's efforts to look beyond the scan, but he has skirted an important issue, which is, Why are scans so prevalent in the first place?
Scans -- M.R.I., CT, ultrasound and PET -- generate profits and revenue, for the manufacturers who make the devices, for the doctors who prescribe them, and for the hospitals and labs that perform them. This, I believe, is the primary reason that scans are such a routine (and growing) part of American health care.
As Dr. Verghese points out, such scans often have the effect of creating distance between health care professionals and patients. This is one good reason to reduce their use. An equally good reason is that scans are a source of health care inflation, generating additional costs while providing little benefit in many cases.
We should focus not just on the "distancing" effect of scanners, but also on their efficacy and the effect they have on health care cost inflation.
John Ranta
Hancock, N.H., Feb. 27, 2011

To the Editor:
Abraham Verghese makes some excellent points. One thing he does not address is how much this overreliance on technology is costing.
When my mother was hospitalized with the terminal stages of heart failure, she was given one CT scan after another. It was frustrating for her daughters to see this, knowing that in the end it drove up her Medicaid bills without doing anything to ease her suffering. No one consulted with her or her family about the tests ordered; they just went ahead and did them.
I don't fault the doctors for giving her the best care they could; I do fault them for not seeing the whole picture. It was as if they were frantic to just see "one more scan" that might tell them something different from what they knew to be true.

Full text: This is no oil shock -- not yet, anyway.
But the events unfolding in the Arab world, the epicenter of global oil production, are a sobering reminder that trading in oil, that mother of all commodities, is at heart a political game. Not since Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990 have the politics of crude loomed so large. Like much of the Arab world, this market seems like a pocket full of firecrackers, just waiting for a match.
As rebels tightened their noose around Tripoli on Sunday, its critical oil supplies remained constricted. Production from most of Libya's oil fields was down to a trickle.
Several ports and refineries were left stricken by workers too afraid to go to work. And with most foreign oil company employees having left the country and armed men beginning to loot equipment left behind, a return to normal production appears weeks away at best.
About 80 percent of the nation's oil production lies in rebel-held territory, though there is not a way to verify how much rebel leaders directly control.
Granted, the world can cope with a disruption of exports from Libya. But what has brought us to $100-a-barrel oil again -- and set people on edge -- is the possibility that the uprisings that toppled autocrats in Egypt and Tunisia might spread to other OPEC nations in the Middle East.
For the moment, heavyweights like Saudi Arabia can make up the difference, and big consumers, like the United States, have stored millions of barrels of oil for just this kind of emergency.
But few oil experts are surprised that the unrest has so unnerved the market. The world is thirsty for oil, and supply and demand are in delicate balance. There is little room for more disruptions in supplies. Indeed, spare capacity -- essentially that amount of extra oil that OPEC members are able to produce in a pinch -- is now about five million barrels a day. That is about 6 percent of the oil that the world consumes every day. That cushion is greater than in 2008, when it equaled about 2 percent of daily consumption, but it remains worryingly thin. And that is not even taking into account the loss of about one million barrels a day exported from Libya.
"There is a vulnerability to tightness," said David Knapp, senior energy economist at Energy Intelligence, a specialized publisher. "But for now, there are enough barrels out there in commercial storage and OPEC's spare capacity and strategic reserves held by industrial countries to handle a medium-duration outage from Libya."
The question on everyone's mind is what if this goes beyond Libya. Costanza Jacazio, an energy analyst at Barclays Capital in New York, says further unrest -- or simply fear of further unrest -- could well drive oil prices higher. "The degree of geopolitical risk now is massive."
Jan Stuart, an energy economist at Macquarie Securities, explained: "This brings back the political dimension to oil-price dynamics. For the best part of the past 25 years, the Saudis have bent backwards to make sure politics would be banned from discussions about oil supplies. The risk today is we could go back the other way again."
The price of oil had been rising steadily even before the wave of pro-democracy protests swept much of the Middle East and North Africa. A recovering global economy had convinced traders that demand for oil was going to rise by about 2 percent in 2011. Some industry experts and Wall Street seers were predicting a gradual march back to $120 and even $150. The thinking was that investors would pour money into the commodity markets.
Oil futures in New York jumped nearly $12 last week to settle at $97.88 a barrel, their highest since October 2008; in London, benchmark Brent crude traded close to $115 a barrel.
Now economists worry that high and rising energy prices could hurt the economy just as it is beginning to revive. The price of gasoline averaged $3.29 a gallon on Friday, up from $3.11 a month ago. As a rule, every 1-cent increase takes more than $1 billion out of consumers' pockets a year.
If prices keep climbing, consumers will in all likelihood tighten their belts. If prices stay high for long, the impact could be severe: every oil shock of the past 40 years has helped push the global economy into recession. Nariman Behravesh, senior economist at IHS Global Insight, said that every $10 increase in the price of a barrel of oil reduces economic growth by two-tenths of a percentage point after one year and a full percentage point over two years.
In some ways, something like this was bound to happen. This is not a "black swan" event -- a sudden, unexpected occurrence -- but a white swan one, said Michael A. Levi, senior fellow for energy and the environment at the Council on Foreign Relations.
"You can't predict what the specific disruption there will be, but you can be sure there will be some disruption," he said.
To calm markets, Saudi Arabia has started to increase its crude output to more than nine million barrels a day, roughly 700,000 barrels more than at the end of 2010, Energy Intelligence reported. Saudi officials are also asking European refiners, who are most directly affected by the drop in Libyan exports, how much and what grades of crude they need for quick shipment.
And the International Energy Agency, an organization of consuming countries, also helped defuse tensions in the markets when it said Thursday that the world had "the tools at hand to deliver adequate oil to the market," including the availability of emergency stocks held by consuming nations.
Much now hinges on what happens next in the Middle East. The price spikes that accompanied the two Persian Gulf wars did not have deep impacts because of they did not last long enough. But several oil price increases have preceded economic downturns.
The biggest shock followed the 1973-74 OPEC embargo, which quadrupled oil prices and helped produce stagflation, a period of slow growth, high unemployment and inflation.
The 1979 Iranian revolution caused another shortage, and again American motorists were forced to wait in long lines for gasoline. Oil prices surged, but they did not stay elevated for long, as Mexico, Nigeria and Venezuela expanded production and OPEC lost its unity. Oil prices remained low for years, and the economy through the later half of the 1980s and most of the 1990s was generally strong.
If the current unrest helps drive the price of a barrel up by $40 to $50, back to its level of three years ago, that would really hurt.
"If gasoline prices go over $4 a gallon, there could be a big psychological effect," Mr. Behravesh said, "but it would have to last."

Full text: CORRECTION APPENDED
To the Editor:
Re "Money Won't Buy You Health Insurance," by Donna Dubinsky (Op-Ed, Feb. 20):
Three years ago, I discovered the hard truth about health insurance. Although I was and continue to be self-employed, my husband worked for a company with generous health care benefits. Our family, the three of us, were healthy -- until, that is, my husband received a diagnosis of terminal pancreatic cancer at age 51. He died just over a month later.
Although his company extended our coverage for as long as legally possible, its end was rapidly in sight. I learned firsthand how expensive and limited individual coverage was to buy.
I have submitted my application and am patiently waiting to hear if I've been accepted. I've been told that as long as my coverage has been continuous, I stand an excellent chance. But I am now days away from my coverage ending. To be honest, I'm terrified.
What most do not understand is that we are one death, one job loss or one illness away from catastrophe. I am more fortunate than most; I have the financial resources to afford health coverage. Now I hope I am lucky enough to be approved to be allowed to buy it. Health care reform cannot come fast enough for me.
Jo Turpin
Millburn, N.J., Feb. 20, 2011

To the Editor:
I was deeply moved by Donna Dubinsky's tale of trying to find insurance for her family. I am aware of many people, both unemployed and underemployed, who live without any health insurance because they simply cannot afford it. Some of them have not pursued the more expensive private options, so they have not suffered being refused for trivial reasons; others have had care for conditions (like breast cancer) that make them ineligible.
I imagine every American knows people who are living in fear of needing basic medical help, healthy care. I am appalled that a nation of great wealth and potential so underserves its population, regardless of health and age.
I strongly support the suggestion that members of Congress should no longer have preferential treatment. As Ms. Dubinsky writes, "Let's credit their pay for the amount that has been paid by the taxpayers, and let them try to buy health insurance in the individual market." They might soon recognize the desirability of health care reform with a single-payer system.
Mary D. Allen
Philadelphia, Feb. 21, 2011

To the Editor:
I was sorry to read how hard it was for Donna Dubinsky, the former Palm executive, to find individual health insurance for her family -- and about the 20 percent yearly rate increases they face. I noticed she lives in California. Perhaps if Americans were allowed to buy insurance in any of the 50 states, more and cheaper options would be available.
That and other ideas -- tort reform to cap malpractice verdicts and expanded health savings accounts, to name two -- have been discussed for years. Sadly, the onerous and convoluted health reform law that Congress passed ignores those and other worthy reforms.
Bill Apple
New York, Feb. 20, 2011

To the Editor:
The key phrase in Donna Dubinsky's article is, "If we are not going to have universal coverage." Any reform that doesn't offer nonprofit, quality, affordable universal access is inferior and fraught with serious problems, not to mention the complexity and unfairness of for-profit insurance.
Until we reform Medicare and create Medicare for all, including the option to buy private insurance as we do with public and private education, the nation will suffer with the ever-growing injustices of the lack of access to care for more and more Americans, skyrocketing inflation of health care costs and the worst outcomes among all the developed nations on the planet.

To the Editor:
Donna Dubinsky hypothesizes that if members of Congress -- particularly those intent on undoing the recent health care legislation -- had to procure their own individual coverage, they would all be denied. They would then (presumably) better understand the need for reform.
Of course, the reality is that none of them would be denied coverage. Any sensible insurance company would weigh "pre-existing conditions" against "member of Congress" and make the choice most likely to ensure its own long-term health.
Jonathan R. Bass
San Francisco, Feb. 21, 2011

To the Editor:
Donna Dubinsky describes her family's frustrating inability to buy individual health insurance in California because of minor pre-existing conditions and other obstacles.
What she doesn't mention is that in just one state, Massachusetts, her dilemma can't happen. No one can be denied coverage because of a pre-existing condition, and any resident can buy a quality health insurance policy, without a broker, online in 10 minutes flat, making easy apples-to-apples comparisons among policies.
This is the future of health insurance for all Americans thanks to the federal Affordable Care Act -- a health insurance system that puts consumers first. Ms. Dubinsky's story illustrates why the law needs to be carried out and why it is worth defending.

Correction: March 1, 2011, Tuesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Because of an editing error, an earlier version of the letter from Brookline, Mass., referred incorrectly to the Affordable Care Act. It is the federal health reform law, not the Massachusetts law.

Abstract: MONETARY policy makers at the Federal Reserve have long been classified as "hawks" or "doves." Reductions in American interest rates make domestic assets less attractive, reducing the demand for dollars and lowering the currency's value in foreign exchange markets.

Full text: MONETARY policy makers at the Federal Reserve have long been classified as "hawks" or "doves." The distinction is appealing in its simplicity. Hawks care deeply about inflation, while doves are willing to risk inflation to reduce unemployment.
Unfortunately, this division is no longer useful. Monetary policy makers are all hawks now. Even those who most emphasize the Fed's role in fighting unemployment oppose policies that would raise inflation noticeably above the Fed's implicit target of about 2 percent.
The real division is not about the acceptable level of inflation, but about its causes, and the dispute is limiting the Fed's aid to the economic recovery. The debate is between what I would describe as empiricists and theorists.
Empiricists, as the name suggests, put most weight on the evidence. Empirical analysis shows that the main determinants of inflation are past inflation and unemployment. Inflation rises when unemployment is below normal and falls when it is above normal.
Though there is much debate about what level of unemployment is now normal, virtually no one doubts that at 9 percent, unemployment is well above it. With core inflation running at less than 1 percent, empiricists are therefore relatively unconcerned about inflation in the current environment.
Theorists, on the other hand, emphasize economic models that assume people are highly rational in forming expectations of future inflation. In these models, Fed actions that call its commitment to low inflation into question can cause inflation expectations to spike, leading to actual increases in prices and wages.
For theorists, any rise in an indicator of expected or future inflation, like the recent boom in commodity prices, suggests that the Fed's credibility is at risk. They fear that general inflation could re-emerge quickly, despite high unemployment.
Now, not every monetary policy maker fits neatly into these categories. Most empiricists care about expectations of inflation and would hesitate to take extreme actions for fear that they would damage the Fed's credibility. Some theorists oppose monetary expansion on other grounds, like the fear of setting off asset price bubbles. But the main division is between the empiricists who say "inflation is unlikely at 9 percent unemployment" and the theorists who say "inflation could bite us at any moment."
These differing views have come to a head around the Fed's policy of quantitative easing -- monetary expansion when the benchmark federal funds rate is near zero. Quantitative easing typically involves purchases of longer-term assets. The Fed bought more than a $1 trillion of mortgage-backed securities and $300 billion of long-term government bonds over the course of 2009 and early 2010, and has committed to buy an additional $600 billion of long-term government bonds through June.
Quantitative easing can help the economy through several channels. It can push down longer-term interest rates that are not yet at zero. This encourages interest-sensitive spending, like construction, investment and consumer purchases of durable goods. It can also lessen fears of deflation, and so lower the real cost of borrowing, even if nominal interest rates barely fall.
Like conventional monetary policy, quantitative easing also works through exchange rates. Reductions in American interest rates make domestic assets less attractive, reducing the demand for dollars and lowering the currency's value in foreign exchange markets. This tends to decrease our imports and increase our exports, raising domestic production and employment.
Most monetary policy makers agree that quantitative easing can stimulate the economy. Studiesshow that news of the first round led to declines in mortgage rates and other long-term interest rates. And long-term rates and the dollar fell slightly over the late summer and early fall in conjunction with Fed hints and announcements of its latest actions.
The fight over quantitative easing is about the costs. The empiricists say the policy won't cause inflation because the economy remains so weak. The theorists argue that a small gain in growth could come at the price of a rapid rise in inflation. Although the Survey of Professional Forecasters, conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, shows virtually no change in long-run inflation expectations since the start of the program, the theorists hold fast to their concerns.
As a confirmed empiricist, I am frustrated that the two sides have been able to agree only on painfully small additional aid for a very troubled economy. For a sense of how much more useful monetary policy could be, one can look to the Great Depression.
By 1933, short-term interest rates were near zero -- just as they are today. As I described in a 1992 academic article, Franklin D. Roosevelt took the United States off the gold standard in April 1933, and rapid devaluation led to huge gold inflows and a large increase in the money supply. Roosevelt also made it clear that the monetary expansion would not be reversed. Expectations of deflation, which had been enormous, abated quickly. As a result, with nominal rates at zero, real interest rates (the nominal rate less expected inflation) plummeted.
The first types of demand to recover were ones that were sensitive to interest rates. Automobile production, for example, jumped 42 percent from March to April in 1933. Inflation did pick up somewhat in the mid-1930s, in part because of other New Deal measures like the National Industrial Recovery Act. But the inflation was modest, and after the crushing deflation of the early 1930s, widely celebrated.
THE triumph of hawkish views on inflation means that there is no appetite today for a Roosevelt-style, inflationary monetary policy. But that doesn't mean the Fed couldn't be more aggressive if the empiricists were willing to risk a split with the theorists.
In a strongly worded article and speech several years ago, before he was Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke provided a user's manual for responsible but unconventional monetary policy. Mr. Bernanke focused on Japan in the 1990s, but his recommendations could apply just as well to the United States today.
The Fed could engage in much more aggressive quantitative easing, both in size and in scope, to further lower long-term interest rates and value of the dollar. It could more effectively convey to markets its intentions for the funds rate, which would also lower long-term rates. And it could set a price-level target, which, unlike an inflation target, calls for Fed policy to take past years' price changes into account. That would lead the Fed to counteract some of the extremely low inflation during the recession with a more expansionary policy and lower real rates for a while.
All of these alternatives would be helpful and would retain the Fed's credibility as a defender of price stability. And any would be better than doing too little just because some Fed policy makers believe in an unproven, theoretical view of how inflation works.

Full text: LATE last year, when demand for emerging-market stocks reached new heights, investors viewed the threat of global inflation as yet another reason to keep betting on them.
That's because the fortunes of many companies based in fast-developing regions like Asia and Latin America are linked to commodity production, which stands to benefit when inflation rises. That would explain why nearly three-quarters of professional money managers surveyed by Russell Investments late last year described themselves as "bullish" on emerging-market equities, even as inflation worries began to climb.
Yet after the first real signs of inflation surfaced this year -- in January, consumer prices in Europe and core wholesale prices in the United States both climbed to their highest level in two years -- emerging-market stocks experienced their first real setback since the global financial panic of 2008. The average mutual fund that invests in a diversified basket of emerging-market shares has lost nearly 6 percent of its value so far this year, according to Morningstar. The Standard & Poor's 500 index of domestic stocks, meanwhile, has climbed by 5 percent.
This development would seem to underscore the growing complexity of investing in emerging markets -- as well as their growing risks, strategists say.
On the one hand, the poor performance of these markets reflects a simple fact: Many developing markets have become a victim of their recent success.
Robert C. Doll, global chief investment officer for equities at BlackRock, the investment manager, noted in a recent report that while growth had stalled in many parts of the developed world, emerging economies "continued to grow during the global recession and are now getting an additional growth jolt as the global recovery gains traction."
As a result, central banks in many of those regions have had to start raising interest rates in an effort to curb inflationary pressures -- which were brought about by that growth.
China is an example. In an attempt to keep a lid on food costs and other prices, the People's Bank of China raised key short-term lending rates three times in the last four months.
That, in turn, has held down stock prices there: Chinese equities are down roughly 5 percent so far this year. Mr. Doll noted that even though tightened monetary policies in the emerging markets had temporarily depressed stock prices, economic activity in those regions had stayed strong.
According to IHS Global Insight, China's economy is expected to expand three times faster than that of the United States this year. This would suggest that "further tightening is likely" throughout the emerging markets," Mr. Doll said.
To be sure, some developing markets that are big commodity producers are benefiting from rising prices. Russia's stock market, for example, has appreciated by more than 18 percent over the last three months as oil prices have shot to nearly $100 a barrel.
But rising fuel costs have added to food inflation throughout the world, which "can also lead to unrest in emerging markets where they spend a much higher percentage of their income on food than in developed nations," said Jeffrey N. Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL Financial in Boston. The potential for turmoil was underlined last week as growing unrest in the Middle East spread to oil-rich Libya, helping oil prices to hit a new two-year high.
That growing instability served as a "stark reminder of the political risks in the emerging markets," said Jack A. Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank in Chicago.
Mr. Ablin noted that so far this year, investors have not been rewarded for exposure to greater political risks abroad.
THAT explains why a torrent of money has been fleeing the emerging markets of late. A survey by Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch found that only 5 percent of professional fund managers were "overweight" on emerging-market stocks in February, meaning they held a greater stake in such shares than their investment strategy would normally call for. In January, that figure stood as high as 43 percent.
Of course, it's possible that the recent troubles in emerging-market stocks may eventually turn into a buying opportunity. But these stocks have trounced domestic equities for 15 years, so it may take a lot longer for prices to reset to attractive levels.

TALIBAN SWITCHING TACTICS
In Effort to Turn Afghans
Instead of firefights aimed at Western troops, the Taliban and other insurgent groups in Afghanistan are deploying suicide bombs to sow terror, according to military analysts. The insurgents' bet that fear will trump anger and that Afghans will lose faith in their government's security forces and eventually turn to the Taliban. In less than four weeks, 116 Afghans have died in seven suicide attacks. News Analysis. Page 6
ATTACK ON IRAQ REFINERY
Iraq's largest oil refinery was crippled by a predawn attack after gunmen stormed the vast complex, killed one engineer and set off several bombs. The attack, the second this month against Iraq's oil sector, shut down parts of the Baiji Refinery, halting the production of about 150,000 barrels per day of oil derivatives and raising questions about the security of Iraq's antiquated refineries.

OPTION IN JAPAN'S IMPASSE
A Japanese ruling party elder suggested that Prime Minister Naoto Kan's resignation was an option to win opposition support for bills to enact a workable budget, adding to pressure on the unpopular leader as he struggles with a divided parliament.

School Finances Feel Pinch
At the beginning of the school year, the Toledo, Ohio, school district cut high school cross-country, wrestling, golf and boys' tennis teams, along with all intramural activities. It is a scenario that is being played out across the country, as high unemployment, falling home values and declining tax revenues continue to batter school finances. Page 14
A RECORD LOBSTER HAUL
Maine's 2010 lobster haul -- some 93 million pounds, up from 81 million in 2009 -- was the largest on record, with the decline of predators, like cod, and the state's strict conservation rules for lobster among the most commonly cited reasons. Despite the vast supply, prices went up, too, a promising turn of events after the global financial crisis forced drastic price declines in 2009. Page 14
DISAPPEARING EARMARKS
There is an extraordinary aspect to the fiscal clash unfolding on Capitol Hill: earmarks have disappeared from the budgetary landscape.

Derek Jeter's Tampa mansion, which features seven bedrooms, nine bathrooms, a pool, two boat lifts, a drive-through portico and a pair of three-car garages flanking the north and south ends of the property, has generated dozens of stories in area newspapers in the past few years and drew national attention last week when the Yankees' co-chairman, Hank Steinbrenner, remarked that some players had been "too busy building mansions" last season and not concentrating enough on winning.

FUTURE OF IN-LINE HOCKEY
Professional in-line hockey -- or roller hockey, as it is more commonly known -- was extremely successful early, and in the 1990s seemed to be on the fast track to legitimacy. While things quickly went south when ESPN declined renew its TV contract with the league in 1996, some enthusiasts say that making in-line hockey an Olympic sport would start a revival. Page 2

Full text: LIFE expectancy at birth for Americans is about 78. But many Americans will die well before then, while others, like Eunice Sanborn, who died in Texas last month, will live to be 114.
Anyone planning for retirement must answer an impossible question: How long will I live? If you overestimate your longevity, you might scrimp unnecessarily. If you underestimate, you might outlive your savings.
This is hardly a new problem -- and yet not a single financial product offers a satisfactory solution to this risk.
We believe that a new product -- a federally issued, inflation-adjusted annuity -- would make it possible for people to deal with this problem, with the bonus of contributing to the public coffers. By doing good for individuals, the federal government could actually do well for itself.
The insurance industry sells an inflation-adjusted annuity that goes part of the way toward helping people cope with the possibility of outliving their savings. During your working years or at the time of retirement, you can pay a premium to an insurance company in exchange for the promise that the company will pay you a fixed annual income, adjusted for inflation, until you die.
But in a world in which A.I.G. had an excellent rating only days before it became a ward of the state, how can someone -- particularly a young person -- know for sure which insurance companies will be solvent half a century from now? Annuities aren't federally guaranteed. The only backstops are state-based systems, and the current protection ceilings are sometimes modest. If an insurance company goes under, the retiree may end up with nothing close to what was promised.
The federal government can offer a product that solves that problem. Individuals would face no more risk of default than that associated with Treasury bills and other obligations backed by the United States.
Here's how it would work. Initially, people who wanted to buy this insurance would enroll through one of the qualified retirement savings plans already offered to the public, like a 401(k) plan, and could choose this annuity option instead of, or in addition to, investments in stocks, bonds or mutual funds.
How much the payouts would be could be based on a variety of factors, including interest rates on government bonds; mortality tables that, among other things, take into account that healthier people are more likely to buy annuities; and administrative costs. This new product wouldn't cost the government a penny. In fact, the Treasury would benefit. It is only an incremental move beyond issuing inflation-adjusted bonds, which the Treasury already does. By allowing the government to tap a new class of investors, the cost of government borrowing over all would probably drop.
Moreover, by expanding the government's base of domestic investors, the plan would help address overreliance on foreign lenders, who now own close to half of all outstanding federal debt -- nearly 10 times the proportion in 1970. True, the government would be on the hook if a technological breakthrough caused an unanticipated increase in life expectancy. But that's a risk that the government is already bearing implicitly: that is, a drastic enough increase could threaten the solvency of private issuers of annuities as well as the many retirees who don't have annuities, creating pressure for government bailouts of insurers or individuals. Taking on the risk explicitly and pricing the fair cost of this risk into the annuities is a far preferable route.
There is also the concern that government-issued annuities would crowd out private annuity sales. To the contrary: they could spur growth in private annuities. Since the inflation-adjusted monthly payments on such risk-free government annuities would be low, many retirees may choose to supplement them with riskier, higher-paying annuities.
Furthermore, insurance companies could be allowed to package the government-issued annuities with their own products, creating appealing combinations that mix safety and the potential for higher returns.
Our proposal is a winner for everyone. The Treasury could lower borrowing costs and diversify its investor base while acknowledging and budgeting for risk that it already bears. Individuals could eliminate the risk of living too long. By looking at the promised rate of return on the annuities, individuals will have a better sense of how much they need to save. The Eunice Sanborns of the world, as well as all taxpayers, would rest a little easier at night.

Abstract: While the lack of rising demand has played a role in holding down the North American price for natural gas, increased supplies from exploitation of shale oil have also played a role. Josef Auer, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, speculated this week that efforts might be made to build an infrastructure that would allow the United States to export liquefied natural gas in ships.

Full text: CRUDE oil prices have risen this year, and this week they briefly touched $100 a barrel for the first time since 2008.
But not everyone felt the pinch. While gasoline prices were rising in the United States, the cost of heating most homes was actually falling a bit. Natural gas prices are well below their levels at the end of 2010.
As the accompanying charts show, natural gas fell to a historical low relative to oil this week. The price of natural gas is now less than one-quarter that of oil on an energy-equivalent basis.
That steep divergence reflects the fact that while natural gas and oil can sometimes be used as substitute fuels, for the most part they are two different markets. One is global, while the other is continental. And that can make all the difference.
As the charts show, the prices of the two can vary sharply. In the early 1990s, gas was relatively cheap because of what was called the "gas bubble" in the United States. Then excess supply held down the price. As the American economy picked up steam, the price difference all but vanished by early 1994.
By late 2000, the price advantage had moved sharply in the other direction. That was when California briefly experienced a shortage of electricity generation, and prices for gas to fuel power plants went through the roof. But the advantage did not last long, and with the American economy in recession the price of gas fell rapidly in 2001.
More recently, something similar has happened. In mid-December 2008, with world trade flows plunging and virtually all economies stumbling, oil and gas prices neared parity. But since then oil prices have risen by about 175 percent, adjusted for inflation, while gas prices are down by more than 25 percent.
While the lack of rising demand has played a role in holding down the North American price for natural gas, increased supplies from exploitation of shale oil have also played a role. Josef Auer, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, speculated this week that efforts might be made to build an infrastructure that would allow the United States to export liquefied natural gas in ships. But any impact of that on markets would be years off.
A generation ago, the developed world, and particularly the United States, provided the marginal demand for oil. That gave the United States something of a self-correcting mechanism. If high oil prices damaged the American economy, that would in turn reduce demand and help to bring world oil prices back down.
But now the marginal demand is more likely to come from China. In 2009, the last year for which figures are available, the world consumed 11 percent more oil than it had used a decade earlier. The regional pattern changed sharply in that time. The United States, Japan and the developed countries of Europe all used less oil. The rest of the world increased consumption by about a third.
As a result, the stronger recovery in developing countries has helped to push up oil prices over the last 15 months, even though the Western economies have been stumbling. Oil can be shipped anywhere, and tankers can be diverted rapidly from one country to another if demand patterns change. For now, at least, natural gas in North America can move only in pipelines.
Over the last several weeks, the upward price pressure on oil from a booming China has been supplemented by worries about a reduction of supply as revolutions grip the Middle East. The run-up to $100 oil came as Libyan production was falling. The price retreated a bit when Saudi Arabia promised to produce more if necessary to offset a cutoff of Libyan exports.
Signs of Mideast stability would no doubt reduce upward pressure on oil prices. But sharp price declines may be unlikely unless, and until, Asian economies stumble and decrease their demand for oil.

G.M. Encounters A Speed Bump

Abstract: G.M. exceeded expectations, and probably made money in the quarter, only as a result of $800 million in one-time revenue gains, including $200 million each from paying off debt to the U.A.W. health care trust and from reassessing contingent liabilities on assets owned by the old G.M. that is still in bankruptcy. In 2004, the International Energy Agency calculated that an increase of $10 a barrel would reduce gross domestic product growth in developed countries by 0.4 percent a year over the next two years.

Full text: The Middle East is giving General Motors its first big test since it left the junkyard. As shares of G.M. hover at their November initial public offering price, investors are not forgetting what happened when oil prices surged last time around. When crude prices in the United States reached $100 a barrel in 2008 -- a level they returned to this week -- G.M.'s profit center in trucks and sport utility vehicles took a big hit.
To be fair, a spike in prices at the pump is not likely to send G.M. back into bankruptcy. G.M., the Detroit behemoth, shed more than enough liabilities in its 2009 reorganization to survive. And it cut an additional $17 billion in debt last year. The question is whether it has overhauled its operations radically enough to turn a decent buck making smaller cars.
Shareholders are clearly anxious. G.M.'s stock fell 4.5 percent after the company announced fourth-quarter earnings, while Ford Motor's stock declined 1 percent. That left G.M. shares at only cents above the $33 I.P.O. price, having dipped below it earlier in the day.
The stock dropped partly because the carmaker's $510 million profit was not as good as it looked. G.M. exceeded expectations, and probably made money in the quarter, only as a result of $800 million in one-time revenue gains, including $200 million each from paying off debt to the U.A.W. health care trust and from reassessing contingent liabilities on assets owned by the old G.M. that is still in bankruptcy.
But G.M.'s results also exposed how a dip in truck and S.U.V. sales -- in the quarter before the turmoil began in the Middle East -- can still hurt. That reduced North America earnings before interest and taxes by $600 million in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter. In addition, G.M. had to offer more incentives.
G.M. has offered more fuel-efficient vehicles in recent years, including the electric Chevy Volt. For now, though, it looks as if investors are wary of giving the company the benefit of the doubt. Rightly so: G.M.'s management, led by its new chief executive, Daniel F. Akerson, has yet to show that this time it is different.
Oil Shock
Oil still lubricates the global economy and could make it seize up. Prices for Brent crude above $110 a barrel raise the specter of previous shocks. Judged by fundamental supply and demand, there is no reason for prices to remain so high. But a sustained spike would be a big problem for economic growth.
Quantifying that problem is an inexact science. In 2004, the International Energy Agency calculated that an increase of $10 a barrel would reduce gross domestic product growth in developed countries by 0.4 percent a year over the next two years. It would also add 0.5 percent to annual inflation. The impact would be more severe in the developing world: in Asia, growth would be 0.8 percent lower and inflation 1.4 percent higher.
But the energy agency's estimates were made when oil cost just $25 a barrel. While a $10 price increase today is lower in percentage terms, the absolute level is much higher: at the current price, oil consumption accounts for more than 5 percent of global G.D.P.
The world today probably uses oil more efficiently. Even so, the recent increase poses dual threats of inflation and recession. High growth rates in China, India and other emerging economies mean inflation is already rising. More expensive oil will hurt consumers, but give extra impetus to inflation. Governments and central banks will face a dilemma: to tighten now, or increase inflation risks by assuming the shock is temporary.
In the developed world, the great threat is to growth. In the euro zone periphery, higher oil prices will make recovery more difficult. But the European Central Bank will probably still respond to a further climb in inflation which, at 2.4 percent, is already above target. In Britain, the 15 percent annual increase in fuel prices is already the chief factor behind the 4 percent inflation rate. The danger that oil could push Britain back into recession is real.
Globally the impacts will intertwine. Damage to Western consumers will harm the exports and growth of emerging economies. The threat will recede if the Persian Gulf escapes serious unrest and prices retreat. But the longer oil remains expensive, the more global nerves will jangle.

Abstract: [...] thanks to growing demand from both business and leisure passengers, the airlines have not had any trouble selling seats. Because they have not added much new capacity as the economy has picked up, their planes are still flying full, especially during peak hours. [...] as airlines continue to find customers for their most expensive fares, analysts said, they are reducing the number of their cheapest seats -- and even those are not so cheap anymore.

Full text: CORRECTION APPENDED
Airline passengers should prepare themselves for sticker shock this year.
As the carriers have tried to keep up with rapidly rising oil prices, they have already increased their fares four times since the start of the year, compared with only three increases for all of 2010. The airlines have also raised some of their fees, imposed summer peak-time surcharges and added hefty fuel surcharges on international flights.
Even traditional low-cost carriers that have long undercut their rivals are joining in. Southwest Airlines, for example, which usually resists industrywide fare increases, participated in several rounds, including one this week.
While the rising ticket prices have matched the steady increase in fuel costs in recent months, the turmoil in the Middle East has sent oil prices sharply higher. That surge now threatens to derail the airline industry's fragile recovery and may lead to even more surcharges. At today's prices, fuel accounts for about 40 percent of the industry's costs, up from about 30 percent just last year.
As a result of the uncertainty in the oil markets, airline stocks extended their losses on Wednesday, after Tuesday's steep declines. Airline stocks are down 11 percent just this week.
The airlines have few options to deal with their rising costs. Most carriers were already hedging some of their fuel purchases to protect against sudden price increases. They can also look for more fuel-efficient planes, but that requires billions of dollars in investments and takes years. In the meantime, they have little choice but to pass on costs to travelers.
So far, thanks to growing demand from both business and leisure passengers, the airlines have not had any trouble selling seats. Because they have not added much new capacity as the economy has picked up, their planes are still flying full, especially during peak hours. And as airlines continue to find customers for their most expensive fares, analysts said, they are reducing the number of their cheapest seats -- and even those are not so cheap anymore.
"Airlines are raising their fares because, right now, they think they can," said Jeff Straebler, a strategist at RBS. "People will actually buy the tickets at those fares."
In January, the cheapest round-trip fare from any of the top 50 airports in the country averaged $367 -- 10 percent higher that the average of $333 for the same time last year, according to FareCompare.com, a consumer airline research Web site.
Rick Seaney, FareCompare's chief executive, said each increase in the last three months had averaged $5 to $12 for the least expensive tickets.
The increases have been far steeper at the front of the plane, in business and first class, as well as for last-minute travelers. American Airlines, United, Continental and US Airways all raised their fares by $20 to $60 on Monday for first- and business-class tickets, and seven-day advance. Last week, Delta Air Lines increased its fares for these high-end tickets by $40 to $120 for a round-trip ticket, according to fare watchers.
On top of that, some airlines are also increasing their fees. US Airways recently raised its fees for a variety of overweight and oversize bags -- those weighing 75 to 100 pounds -- to as much as $175 a bag, from $100. It also raised the cost of a third checked bag, to $125 from $100.
"We've had a lot of airfare hike activity compared with the last two years," Mr. Seaney said.
In recent weeks, the carriers have also bumped up their base ticket prices for travel during the summer by as much as $250, in Virgin Airlines' case. In addition, the airlines have introduced "peak travel" surcharges of $20 to $60 round-trip on some summer departure dates.
Airlines executives have long dreaded the return of higher fuel prices. In 2008, when oil soared above $147 a barrel in New York, the airlines were forced to ground thousands of planes, including some of the least fuel-efficient planes, in a desperate bid to stem their losses.
But the rise in fuel prices once again hangs over the industry's profits. Last year, the top eight airlines earned $4 billion with total revenue of $122 billion, showing a meager profit margin of 3.3 percent.
Oil prices jumped more than $12 a barrel this week, rising above $98 a barrel in New York on Wednesday, after the violent uprising in Libya, a major oil producer. In London, Brent crude futures rose to $111.25 a barrel.
The price of jet fuel, which is now $2.99 a gallon, has soared 58 percent since last summer's lows of $1.89 a gallon.
"Airlines are under a lot of pressure," said Severin Borenstein, a professor of public policy at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley. "Demand is recovering but rising fuel prices may short-circuit that."
The Air Transport Association said last week that passenger revenue had grown 10 percent in January compared with the same time last year. That was the 13th consecutive month of revenue growth for the airlines.
"We have slightly fuller planes and stronger pricing," said John Heimlich, the chief economist at the Air Transport Association. "There is no question we are enjoying the coattails of a stronger global economy after a very depressed period. We are making up for lost years."
Some analysts pointed out that one reason traditional carriers could get away with increasing fares was that Southwest, the largest domestic airline, also saw the need to bolster its own fares.
"Southwest has been acting more like a legacy airline," Mr. Seaney said.
Prices are inching toward their highest levels, reached in 2008. Still, flying remains relatively affordable, once ticket prices are adjusted for inflation. The average air fare in the third quarter of 2010 -- the latest period for which government estimates are available -- was 20 percent lower than in 2000 after inflation is taken into account, according to the government's Bureau of Transportation Statistics.
The airlines, meanwhile, have been resisting an Obama administration proposal to increase ticket fees to help finance airport projects. The president's budget, released on Feb. 14, would raise the passenger facility charge to a maximum of $7 per flying segment, from the current $4.50, to offset a cut of $1.1 billion to airport grants.
Delta has argued that this increase means that a family of four will pay $112 in ticket fees, instead of $72, assuming they buy round-trip tickets with one stop.
A world of higher fuel prices and higher fees might substantially change the way passengers think of air travel -- less a convenient mode of mass transportation and more a luxury, one analyst said.
"Flying is getting more expensive, there is no question about it," said Robert Herbst, a former commercial pilot and independent airline analyst. "These rising energy costs have to be passed on to consumers. For some, this means flying will become less affordable."

Full text: CORRECTION APPENDED
Airline passengers should prepare themselves for sticker shock this year.
As the carriers have tried to keep up with rapidly rising oil prices, they have already increased their fares four times since the start of the year, compared with only three increases for all of 2010. The airlines have also raised some of their fees, imposed summer peak-time surcharges and added hefty fuel surcharges on international flights.
Even traditional low-cost carriers that have long undercut their rivals are joining in. Southwest Airlines, for example, which usually resists industrywide fare increases, participated in several rounds, including one this week.
While the rising ticket prices have matched the steady increase in fuel costs in recent months, the turmoil in the Middle East has sent oil prices sharply higher. That surge now threatens to derail the airline industry's fragile recovery and may lead to even more surcharges. At today's prices, fuel accounts for about 40 percent of the industry's costs, up from about 30 percent just last year.
As a result of the uncertainty in the oil markets, airline stocks extended their losses on Wednesday, after Tuesday's steep declines. Airline stocks are down 11 percent just this week.
The airlines have few options to deal with their rising costs. Most carriers were already hedging some of their fuel purchases to protect against sudden price increases. They can also look for more fuel-efficient planes, but that requires billions of dollars in investments and takes years. In the meantime, they have little choice but to pass on costs to travelers.
So far, thanks to growing demand from both business and leisure passengers, the airlines have not had any trouble selling seats. Because they have not added much new capacity as the economy has picked up, their planes are still flying full, especially during peak hours. And as airlines continue to find customers for their most expensive fares, analysts said, they are reducing the number of their cheapest seats -- and even those are not so cheap anymore.

Abstract: "OPEC is ready to meet any shortage in supply when it happens," the Saudi oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, said at a news conference after a meeting of ministers of oil producing and consuming nations in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Refineries on the East and West Coasts also depend on Brent crude, meaning that the higher prices paid by Europeans are also pushing up gasoline and heating oil prices paid by many New Yorkers, New Englanders and other Americans.

Full text: HOUSTON -- The political turmoil sweeping the Arab world drove oil prices sharply higher and stocks much lower on Tuesday despite efforts by Saudi Arabia to calm turbulent markets.
The unrest that has spread from Tunisia to Libya pushed oil prices to a two-year high and has spurred an increase in gasoline prices. The specter of rising energy costs and accelerating inflation in turn unsettled investors.
Oil is now at a price not seen since the recession began, and it is more than $20 above goals set in recent months by Saudi officials as strong enough to satisfy the top producers but not so strong they might suffocate the global economic recovery.
Although there are still plentiful supplies of oil and gasoline in the United States and in much of the world, American consumers are now paying an average of $3.17 a gallon for regular gasoline, a steep rise of 6 cents a gallon over the last week, according to the AAA daily fuel gauge report. With consumers paying roughly 50 cents more a gallon than a year ago, analysts are warning that prices could easily top $3.50 by the summer driving season.
"Higher energy prices act like a tax on consumers, reducing the amount of discretionary purchasing power that they have," said Lawrence R. Creatura, a portfolio manager at Federated Investors. "It represents an additional, potential headwind for retailers."
Those concerns helped send the Dow Jones industrial average down 178.46 points, or 1.44 percent, to 12,212.79. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 27.57 points, or 2.05 percent, to 1,315.44, while the Nasdaq composite index lost 77.53 points, or 2.74 percent, to 2,756.42. Markets in Asia and Europe were also lower. Treasury prices rose in the United States.
Saudi Arabia's oil minister sought to reassure the markets on Tuesday, saying that OPEC was ready to pump more oil to compensate for any decline. At least 50,000 barrels a day of output has already been halted in Libya. That is only a fraction of the country's production, but with foreign oil companies beginning to shut down operations and evacuate workers and with local ports closing, more output could be lost.
"OPEC is ready to meet any shortage in supply when it happens," the Saudi oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, said at a news conference after a meeting of ministers of oil producing and consuming nations in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. "There is concern and fear, but there is no shortage."
Europe appears most immediately vulnerable to the strife in Libya, which produces almost 2 percent of the world's oil. More than 85 percent of its exports go to Europe; more than a third goes to Italy alone. Libya sends only a small fraction of its oil to the United States, but because oil is a world commodity, Americans are not immune to the price shock waves.
In New York, crude oil for March delivery gained $7.37, or 8.6 percent, to $93.57 a barrel, while oil for April delivery rose 6.4 percent, to $95.42 a barrel. Brent crude, a European benchmark traded in London, rose 4 cents, to $105.78. Refineries on the East and West Coasts also depend on Brent crude, meaning that the higher prices paid by Europeans are also pushing up gasoline and heating oil prices paid by many New Yorkers, New Englanders and other Americans.
Tom Kloza, the chief oil analyst at the Oil Price Information Service, estimated that the Saudis could pump an additional 1 million to 1.5 million barrels in a matter of days. As the largest producer, Saudi Arabia is by far the most influential member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, with a reserve capacity to deliver an additional four million to five million barrels to the world markets after several weeks of preparation. That is more than twice the oil that world markets would lose if production were halted completely by unrest in Libya.
"Unless this unrest spreads to the streets of Jeddah and Riyadh," Mr. Kloza said, "I think it's a very manageable situation and prices are closer to cresting than they are to exploding higher."
While Libya has been the immediate cause for the spike in oil prices recently, oil experts said traders were driving up prices because of concerns that a long period of instability in the Middle East was just beginning. They identified the protests in Bahrain in particular as a disturbing sign that neighboring Saudi Arabia might not be immune to the spreading political contagion.
Bahrain produces little oil, but it is connected to the oil-rich eastern region of Saudi Arabia by a 15-mile causeway. The island nation has a majority Shiite population with cultural and religious ties to the Saudi Shiite minority that lives close to some of the richest Saudi oil fields.
Saudi rulers have long feared that its regional rival, Iran, could try to destabilize Bahrain as a way to cause trouble for the Saudi royal family. Iran's intentions became all the more worrisome to the Saudis when it decided this month to send two warships through the Suez Canal for the first time in more than 30 years.
"No one knows where this ends," said Helima L. Croft, a director and senior geopolitical strategist at Barclays Capital. "A couple of weeks ago it was Tunisia and Egypt, and it was thought this can be contained to North Africa and the resource-poor Middle East countries. But now with protests in Bahrain, that's the heart of the gulf, and it's adding to anxieties."
Middle Eastern oil fields are generally well defended and far from population centers, but energy analysts say the continuing turbulence potentially threatens supply lines and foreign investment that producers like Libya and Algeria depend on to increase production.
World oil prices started rising sharply when demonstrators overwhelmed downtown Cairo earlier in the month because of concerns that unrest could block the Suez Canal and Sumed pipeline through which three million barrels of crude pass daily. Labor unrest continues to roil the canal, though shipments have continued without incident.
Unrest in Yemen potentially threatens the 18-mile-wide Strait of Bab el-Mandeb, a shipping lane between the Horn of Africa and the Middle East that serves as a strategic link between the Indian Ocean and Mediterranean through which nearly four million barrels of oil pass daily. Security for tanker traffic in the area became a concern after terrorists attacked a French tanker off the coast of Yemen in 2002.

Full text: To the Editor:
"Wisconsin Power Play," by Paul Krugman (column, Feb. 21), lays out the real issues in the protests in Madison, Wis. Gov. Scott Walker wants to strip power from any groups that oppose his views and policies. The protesters realized that and took action.
Those occupying the Capitol and walking around it are not radical revolutionaries or disobedient children; they are hard-working citizens committed to making Wisconsin a good place for all citizens and their families. They believe in and support a democratic process in which people discuss issues and arrive at compromises. In other words, they negotiate!
Governor Walker is afraid of negotiating, and he has persuaded the Republicans in the Legislature to give up their power and become his rubber stamp. Thank you, Mr. Krugman, for clearly pointing out why we are protesting in Madison.

To the Editor:
If Wisconsin Republicans are successful in busting unions, which is their intent, they might be setting a trend that could spread to other states and eventually envelop the whole country. If that happened, it would be a profound catastrophe for America and its majority middle class and poor.
Conservatives are always invoking the names of our founding fathers and their intent. I don't believe that the founding fathers envisioned America's becoming a plutocracy -- government of, by and for the rich. With the power of huge mountains of corporate cash taking on an ever-increasing role in determining who governs, now may be the time for democracy-lovers all over our country to begin to speak with their feet. Regular working people must not let corporate greed crush us. Paul L. Whiteley Sr.
Louisville, Ky., Feb. 21, 2011

To the Editor:
Paul Krugman is correct to point out that the Republicans, in Wisconsin and elsewhere, want to eliminate labor unions in the interest of the oligarchs. I would add the fact that labor unions are the financial and organizational backbone of the Democratic Party.
Wiping out labor unions weakens the Democrats. The Republicans' purported budgetary considerations are nothing but a smokescreen.

To the Editor:
What is happening in Wisconsin is inevitable. The state of Wisconsin, like most states, is running out of money. That is a reality. It does not matter how compassionate and generous legislators and the state governors are with taxpayers' money. There is just no more money. So state workers can protest all they want, but there will still be curtailment of their salaries and benefits.

To the Editor:
Re "Wisconsin Leads Way as Workers Fight State Cuts" (front page, Feb. 19):
Gov. Scott Walker's proposal to cut benefits and collective bargaining powers for government employees will inflict long-term damage on our state's schools and government institutions if successful. The most significant aspect of his plan would, as a practical matter, eliminate any reasonable assurances that workers' pay would incrementally rise as their experience increases.
His plan would limit government employees' collective bargaining authority to an increase in wages at no more than the rate of inflation. This means that additional raises would be subject solely to the unfettered wishes of the hiring authority. Where every salary increase will be pitted against revenue from taxes, it is not hard to imagine that employee income will soon flatten out.
But as newly hired teachers, nurses, computer technicians, engineers and other government professionals find that their salaries do not match their increasing skills, they will surely leave for other, more remunerative opportunities.
Regardless of how one feels about public employee unions, it is hard to believe that many Wisconsinites will be satisfied having schools and government agencies perpetually staffed solely by the inept and the inexperienced.
Chuck Vetzner
Madison, Wis., Feb. 19, 2011

To the Editor:
I have never been a union member. At the same time, I recognize that the hard-won victories of the labor movement have resulted in cherished benefits for all American workers, union and nonunion.
To deny unions the right to collective bargaining may signal the beginning of an erosion of basic working conditions for all. The United States cannot start down this road and hope to remain a first-world nation with a vital and contributing working-class population.
Brett Wilder
Ashland, Ore., Feb. 19, 2011

To the Editor:
Your article about the Wisconsin protests against Gov. Scott Walker's budget bill ("Dueling Demonstrations in a Capital Where Nothing Much Is Getting Done," Feb. 20) both hits and misses the point. As someone who has been in the protests for the last week, I have been inspired by how many regular people have flocked to the Capitol to make their voices heard. That is certainly progress.
Nevertheless, the left remains disorganized. We aren't making the most of this golden opportunity to tell the stories of working-class folks who would be affected by Governor Walker's bill to the rest of America. Unless we start doing that, we're going to lose.

Abstract: Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa and chairman of the Senate health committee, encouraged the administration to make any changes that might be required to keep the program fiscally sound, so "no one with a disability will be forced to live in an institution." The program is meant for people with severe disabilities who want to live in the community, though benefits can also be used to help pay for nursing home care or assisted living.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- One of Senator Edward M. Kennedy's legacies in the new health care law, intended to allow the chronically ill and people with disabilities to continue living in their homes, is too costly to survive without major changes, Obama administration officials now say.
Republican lawmakers, who have vowed to repeal the health care law, cite the administration's acknowledgment as yet another reason to do so. But the health and human services secretary, Kathleen Sebelius, says the law gives her plenty of authority to make the necessary changes to the program without Congressional action.
To make the program viable, Ms. Sebelius said, she is considering changes in the eligibility criteria, including employment and earnings requirements, to ensure that only active workers may enroll. She also said she favored adjusting premiums to rise with inflation.
Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa and chairman of the Senate health committee, encouraged the administration to make any changes that might be required to keep the program fiscally sound, so "no one with a disability will be forced to live in an institution."
Under the current law, the program will allow workers 18 and older to buy insurance from the government to cover the costs of long-term care. After paying premiums for at least five years, they are then eligible for benefits if they become unable to perform basic activities of daily living because of chronic illness or crippling injury. The program is meant for people with severe disabilities who want to live in the community, though benefits can also be used to help pay for nursing home care or assisted living.
An employer can arrange for workers to be enrolled automatically, with premiums paid through payroll deductions. An employee can opt out at any time and, apparently, re-enroll later.
Advocates for older Americans and for people with disabilities say the need for such help will explode as baby boomers age. President Obama's 2012 budget seeks $93.5 million for a huge "information and education" campaign, with the goal of having 7.7 million people in the long-term care insurance program by 2015.
In debate on the health care bill in late 2009, Republicans and moderate Democrats repeatedly warned that sicker people were more likely than healthy ones to sign up for the long-term care plan. Enrollment is voluntary, but the law stipulates that premiums must be set high enough to guarantee the solvency of the program over 75 years. Higher premiums would discourage healthier people from participating, economists and actuaries say.
Administration officials, who played down such concerns 15 months ago, say they now share them. Under questioning by a Republican at a Senate hearing last week, Ms. Sebelius said the original version of the program, known as Community Living Assistance Services and Supports, or Class, was "totally unsustainable."
She told the House Ways and Means Committee, "We very much share the concerns that have been expressed that, as written into law, the framework of the program was not sustainable."
But Ms. Sebelius resisted Republican demands for the program's repeal. Instead, she said, she is considering changes to make the program "significantly different than the framework that the law itself describes." A main goal, she said, is to attract more healthy people, thus spreading the financial risk across a larger group.
For example, Ms. Sebelius said, she may alter eligibility criteria, including employment and earnings requirements, to make sure people are established workers when they enroll.
Federal officials have not specified the amount of premiums or benefits. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that nearly 10 million people might enroll in the program by 2019 and said that premiums would start at $123 a month for benefits expected to average $75 a day. Medicare actuaries estimated that 2.8 million people would participate within three years and said premiums needed to be about $240 a month to cover program costs.
Under the current law, Ms. Sebelius said, a person's premiums will generally stay the same, but cash benefits will increase with inflation. She said she favored adjusting premiums to rise with inflation, a change that could deter some workers from participating.
Federal officials said they were also looking for ways to discourage workers from dropping out and re-enrolling.
The law governing the program specifies that "no taxpayer funds shall be used for payment of benefits," a provision Ms. Sebelius said was "nonnegotiable." The health secretary can, however, adjust premiums as needed to maintain the program's solvency. Her power to revamp it in other ways is unclear.
"Secretary Sebelius seems to believe that she has more flexibility to change the program than Congress gave her," said Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota.
The law also says that up to 3 percent of the program's premiums may be used to pay administrative expenses, but since no premiums have been paid, Mr. Obama is seeking the $93.5 million to publicize the program.
"The program's financial solvency and viability will depend on the enrollment of large numbers of participants," the White House said in its 2012 budget request. "Employers and individuals will need to have access to information about the need for long-term services and supports and the benefits of the program. It will be crucial to educate employers about how to enroll their employees and to inform individuals about how to enroll directly."
Public confidence in the program is essential if the government expects millions of people to enroll starting next year. But economists and actuaries have raised many questions.
Richard S. Foster, the chief actuary at the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services; Alicia H. Munnell, director of the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College; and leaders of the American Academy of Actuaries all said the program would be unstable if, as expected, it attracts disproportionate numbers of people with health problems.
Mr. Foster said his analysis showed the program faced "a significant risk of failure" because people who are or expect to be sick or disabled were more likely to sign up. In a study issued this month, Ms. Munnell, an economic adviser to President Bill Clinton, said more stringent work requirements and an effective national advertising campaign could help attract young, healthy people to the insurance pool.
Even so, she said, "premiums may never reach an affordable level for middle-class households," so "the program faces enormous challenges."
Mr. Obama's debt-reduction commission, a bipartisan advisory body, said in its report late last year that Congress should "reform or repeal" the program.
"The program's earliest beneficiaries will pay modest premiums for only a few years and receive benefits many times larger," the panel said, "so that sustaining the system over time will require increasing premiums and reducing benefits to the point that the program is neither appealing to potential customers nor able to accomplish its stated function."

Full text: TOKYO -- Japan's government finances are on the verge of collapse, and its economy has floundered for two decades.
So why do many global investors consider the Japanese stock market a buy?
"Japan is by far one of the cheapest markets in the world," said Charles de Vaulx of International Value Advisers, a New York-based investment firm. "It's so universally hated, yet it might be one of the world's best-performing markets over the next five years."
Of the $12.7 billion in assets Mr. de Vaulx manages, 15 percent is already invested in Japan, and he is considering loading on even more. "So many Japanese companies are well managed from an industrial standpoint," he said.
In the week ending Feb. 11, investors based outside of Japan were net buyers of Japanese stocks for the 15th consecutive week, according to data released by the Tokyo Stock Exchange. That was the longest such run since 2005.
An attraction for the bulls is the fire-sale prices. Although the benchmark Nikkei recently hit a nearly 10-month high, it is still more than two-thirds off its peak before Japan's real estate and stock market bubble burst in 1990.
Shares in Tokyo are also about 20 percent off their levels before the financial crisis hit in 2008 -- one of the few major markets that have yet to rebound.
Prices are so depressed that, at the end of December, nearly two-thirds of the 1,700 companies listed on the Tokyo exchange's main section had price-to-book ratios below 1. That means, in effect, if one of those companies was dismantled and sold off for its parts, it would fetch more than its market value.
"These stock prices are saying there's no hope whatsoever for Japanese companies, and that's simply not true," said Tony Roberts, who manages a $2 billion-dollar Japan fund for London-based Invesco Perpetual. "There are lots of great companies in Japan that add a lot of value," he said.
Certainly Japan can still give investors reasons for doubt -- like the long-term effects of the government's high debt and aging population. There is also the paltry profitability of companies like Sony, which has averaged a 3 percent return on equity over the last five years while its Korean rival, Samsung Electronics, has surpassed 13 percent by the same measure.
Yet "foreign investors who were once automatically giving Japanese stocks a pass are now taking a second look," said Junya Naruse, chief strategist at the Daiwa Institute of Research.
For one thing, the economic recovery gaining strength in the United States is emboldening investors, while helping brighten the outlook for Japan's export-led economy. At the same time, turmoil in the Middle East, rising food inflation and tighter money policies in fast-growing economies like China are prompting some global investors to think twice about emerging markets.
In fact, now that China is Japan's top trading partner, Japanese export stocks seem a less risky way to invest indirectly in Chinese growth.
And while corporate earnings are far from booming, total net profit at Japan's publicly listed companies has more than doubled this fiscal year, according to a Nikkei tally.
More Japanese companies have also tried to counter investors' longstanding complaints that companies here hoard too much cash, instead of investing it or returning it to shareholders. Some companies have raised dividends. Others, including Japan Tobacco and the semiconductor maker Rohm, have announced share buybacks in recent months -- moves that help elevate the value of the companies' remaining shares in the market.
Meanwhile, if the inflation threatening other countries spills over into Japan, it could finally help the country reverse depressed prices, with positive spillovers for the stock market.
Still, investors caution that making money on Japanese stocks requires an intimate knowledge of Japan's corporate landscape. Instead of sticking to well-known global companies like Toyota or Sony, investment managers aim to ferret out small- and medium-size companies trading below their potential.
International Value Advisors, for example, has invested in relatively obscure companies like Kanamoto, which leases construction material, and Milbon, which makes hair care products.
"With proper stock-picking, the Japanese stock market is a place where one can make money," said Mr. de Vaulx of International Value Advisors.
Some activist investors, meanwhile, are trying to coax Japanese companies into creating more value for shareholders, rekindling an issue that ignited contentious battles between foreign investors and Japanese management in the mid-2000s.
Earlier this month, Governance for Owners, an investment firm and shareholder advocate based in London, and Tokio Marine Asset Management of Japan said they would jointly start a fund that would invest 100 billion yen ($1.2 billion) in underperforming small- to mid-cap Japanese companies and take an activist role.
"We feel that there are opportunities in Japan, but there are issues that need addressing," said Simon Wong, a partner at Governance for Owners, pointing especially to the cash hoarding that he said still characterized many Japanese companies.
Domestic investors have started to mirror these moves to home in on underperforming Japanese shares. In late January, Nomura Asset Management set up the Undervalued Japan Stocks Investment Trust, attracting 73 billion yen ($878 million) in retail money, more than double the size of the largest new Japan stock fund last year, according to the research company Lipper.
Renewed investor interest is welcome in a market that has lost its thunder to faster-growing regional rivals. By share turnover, the Tokyo Stock Exchange lost its standing as Asia's top bourse to Shanghai in 2009, although Tokyo still has the continent's biggest exchange by market value.
"Japan offers a very attractive environment: our banks are stable, we are a democracy, and our markets are open and transparent," said Atsushi Saito, chief executive of the stock exchange. "Investment hot spots might be fun for short-term money play. But for the stable management of funds, Japanese equities are much better," he said.
At least until they aren't.
Currently, global markets are volatile over the Middle East turmoil. And some political events could sway Japanese stocks. The Japanese government has promised to decide by June whether it will participate in negotiations for a pan-Pacific free trade zone -- a potential boon for industry, but opposed by farmers.
The same month, the government plans to outline steps to raise its consumption tax, which, if executed poorly, could hurt Japan's economic recovery.
"The rally should continue until June -- after that, it all depends," said Mr. Naruse, of Daiwa. "It's a fragile recovery, and investors could lose faith in Japan again, all at once."
Moody's Downgrades Outlook
TOKYO (AP) -- Moody's Investors Service on Tuesday downgraded its outlook for Japan's credit rating because of concerns over its national debt. The rating agency changed its outlook for Japan's Aa2 rating from stable to negative. The move was not unexpected. Last month, Standard & Poor's cut Japan's credit rating from AA to AA-.

Full text: BEIJING -- Skittish domestic security officials responded with a mass show of force across China on Sunday after anonymous calls for protesters to stage a Chinese "Jasmine Revolution" went out over social media and microblogging outlets.
Although there were no reports of large demonstrations, the outsize government response highlighted China's nervousness at a time of spreading unrest in the Middle East aimed at overthrowing authoritarian governments.
The words "Jasmine Revolution," borrowed from the successful Tunisian revolt, were blocked on sites similar to Twitter and on Internet search engines, while cellphone users were unable to send out text messages to multiple recipients. A heavy police presence was reported in several Chinese cities.
In recent days, more than a dozen lawyers and rights activists have been rounded up, and more than 80 dissidents have reportedly been placed under varying forms of house arrest. At least two lawyers are still missing, family members and human rights advocates said Sunday.
In Beijing, a huge crowd formed outside a McDonald's in the heart of the capital on Sunday after messages went out listing it as one of 13 protest sites across the country. It is not clear who organized the campaign, but it first appeared Thursday on Boxun, a Chinese-language Web site based in the United States, and then spread through Twitter and other microblogging services.
By 2 p.m., the planned start of the protests, hundreds of police officers had swarmed the area, a major shopping district popular with tourists.
At one point, the police surrounded a young man who had placed a jasmine flower on a planter outside the McDonald's, but he was released after the clamor drew journalists and photographers.
In Shanghai, three people were detained during a skirmish in front of a Starbucks, The Associated Press reported. One post on Twitter described a heavily armed police presence on the subways of Shenzhen, and another claimed that officials at Peking University in Beijing had urged students to avoid any protests, but those reports were impossible to verify Sunday.
The messages calling people to action urged protesters to shout, "We want food, we want work, we want housing, we want fairness," an ostensible effort to tap into popular discontent over inflation and soaring real estate prices.
In a sign of the ruling Communist Party's growing anxiety, President Hu Jintao summoned top leaders to a special "study session" on Saturday and urged them to address festering social problems before they became threats to stability.
"The overall requirements for enhancing and innovating social management are to stimulate vitality in the society and increase harmonious elements to the greatest extent, while reducing inharmonious factors to the minimum," he told the gathering, according to Xinhua, the official news agency. Mr. Hu also urged those gathered to step up Internet controls and to better "guide public opinion," a reference to efforts aimed at shaping attitudes toward the government through traditional propaganda and online commentators who masquerade as ordinary users.
Human rights advocates said they were especially concerned by the recent crackdown on rights defenders, which intensified Saturday after at least 15 well-known lawyers and activists were detained or placed under house arrest. Several of them reached by phone, including Pu Zhiqiang and Xu Zhiyong, said they were in the company of security agents and unable to talk, while many others were unreachable on Sunday evening. Two of the men, Tang Jitian and Jiang Tianyong, remain missing.
Many of those subjected to house arrest had met in Beijing on Wednesday to discuss the case of Chen Guangcheng, a blind lawyer under strict house arrest in rural Shandong Province. The plight of Mr. Chen and his family gained widespread attention last week after a video he and his wife made about his arrest emerged on the Internet.
Mr. Jiang, one of the missing lawyers, was forced into an unmarked van on Saturday night, his second abduction in recent days, his wife, Jin Bianling, said by telephone. She said the police had also searched the couple's home and confiscated his computer and briefcase.
In an interview after his first detention on Wednesday, Mr. Jiang said that he was taken to a police station and assaulted.
Most of those who thronged the McDonald's in Wangfujing, the Beijing shopping district, said they had no idea what the commotion was about. Some thought that perhaps a celebrity had slipped into the restaurant for a hamburger. But a young man, a Web page designer in his late 20s, quietly acknowledged that he was drawn by word of the protest.
Despite the absence of any real action, the man, who gave only his family name, Cui, said he was not disappointed by the outcome, in which police officers tried in vain to determine who was a potential troublemaker and who was simply a gawker. He predicted that many people, emboldened by the fact that an impromptu gathering had coalesced at all, would use social networking technology to stage similar events in the future.
"It's very difficult to do this in China, but this is a good start," he said. "I'm thankful to be able to participate in this moment in history."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text: PARIS -- Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner took direct aim at China on Saturday at a meeting of the world's most powerful economies, saying that its currency was still "substantially undervalued" and that recent steps taken by Beijing to adjust its value were too small.
Meeting here over the weekend, financial leaders from the Group of 20 agreed on a set of guidelines to identify when economic and financial developments in some countries would create problems for the rest of the world.
The agreement was forged after France and Germany persuaded China to accept a compromise that includes measuring a country's currency exchange rate as a gauge of the potential problems.
Even though China has allowed its currency, the renminbi, to appreciate against the dollar since last summer, it has not been enough, Mr. Geithner said. As such, the United States and its European partners say, China still retains an unfair edge in trade that is contributing to a two-speed global economy.
Mr. Geithner's blunt assessment added to a yearlong drumbeat that the United States has led, aiming to push Beijing to let the value of its currency rise and address its trade imbalance, pressure the Chinese have stiffly resisted.
Nevertheless, China did agree to compromise language on the yardsticks measuring imbalances in the global economy.
China had originally tried to quash efforts to gauge imbalances by looking at real exchange rates and currency reserves, which the United States and other Western countries see as having contributed to the financial crisis.
China has accumulated substantial currency reserves in United States dollars, helping it to hold down the value of the renminbi and run up a large trade surplus.
But China, after discussions with France and Germany, agreed to include those elements in the guidelines, although the rules were softened, along with public and private debt levels.
These guidelines are a "first step," said Christine Lagarde, the finance minister of France, which is leading the G20 this year.
They grew out of concerns that fast growth in China and other emerging markets would stoke inflation and trade imbalances that could destabilize a recovery, even as advanced countries struggle to overcome lagging growth and high unemployment in the wake of a recession.
Unemployment is expected to stay high for the foreseeable future in the United States and Europe as they recover from the downturn.
Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the head of the International Monetary Fund, said that while the financial crisis was over, "the social crisis is still there, and very strong. If you have growth that doesn't transform into jobs, what does that mean for the man in the street?" he asked.
Jobs and growth are also a major concern in North Africa and the Middle East, where demands for greater democracy and equality have emerged in part from a paucity of economic opportunity, a concern cited by the leaders gathered here in Paris.
Mr. Geithner, citing the "historic events" that have unfolded in North Africa in the last several weeks, said the United States was committed to working with its international partners to secure "a peaceful and orderly transition in Egypt and Tunisia and support the economic reforms necessary to promote broader gains in living standards."
One of the major factors fanning wide social unrest in the region, he and others said, were high food and commodity prices.
The International Monetary Fund estimates that commodity prices jumped 20 to 30 percent last year, a trend that Mr. Strauss-Kahn said was "creating a lot of problems for low-income countries and vulnerable people."
In a separate telephone call with a small group of journalists, Robert Zoellick, the president of the World Bank, said, "We're reaching a danger point" in these countries. He said he urged G20 officials to "put food first in 2011," even as they bicker over technical ways to measure imbalances in the world economy.
Mr. Geithner said the United States would support measures to limit the potential for the manipulation of commodity prices through greater transparency and oversight of the commodity and derivative markets, which some critics worry are being used by speculators to drive up commodity prices.
Beijing's currency policy has helped stoke a breakneck pace of growth in China that, together with other emerging markets, has been cited as a contributing factor in the runup in food and commodity prices.
Not surprisingly, each country is pursuing its own self-interest to resolve internal economic problems. These include high unemployment in the United States and difficult austerity measures in Europe, as countries tighten their belts to mend finances.
"It's very difficult to see any government doing something in its fiscal affairs just to benefit the broader system," Jacob Frenkel, the chairman of JPMorgan Chase International, said in Paris last week at a meeting of the Institute for International Finance.
Cajoling Beijing, however, is a losing proposition, Mr. Frenkel said, because the Chinese don't want to be seen as being pushed around.
Instead, he said, governments should tell China they understand why it has a savings glut, "and then say, 'Let us help you design a system that helps you save less,' " he said. "That would be a win-win strategy," he said.

Full text: CORRECTION APPENDED
When Hasbro showed a new version of Monopoly last week at the Toy Fair, people were aghast that an infrared tower in the center of the board would squawk instructions, track players' money and make sure that everyone abided by the rules.
A generation of children may never learn to make change. They may never learn to argue about rules and change them. And they may never, as I and a group of Monopoly fanatics in college did in a great all-night game, learn important economic lessons. "There might not be the attention span for that anymore," said Mike Zelenty, one of the players.
Monopoly was taken seriously in Shorey House at the University of Chicago in the late 1970s. A room was set aside as "The Monopoly Room." But in that post-Vietnam, pre-Reagan era, all assumptions were questioned and a game our parents played was no exception. Rules were meant to be altered. The house even convened a "constitution convention" to change the official rules of the game to allow a person to build a hotel on a property without first having to own four houses. Mr. Zelenty, now a corporate lawyer in his native New Jersey, remembers holding a sign that said, "New Jersey Espouses / Hotels Without Houses."
The other thing taken as seriously in that dorm was free-market economics or, more precisely, Milton Friedman, the University of Chicago economics professor. This was a house that frequently invited Professor Friedman and his wife, Rose, to sherry hours. House members ran a snack bar in the basement of the dormitory called Tanstaafl, an abbreviation of a saying favored by Mr. Friedman, that "there ain't no such thing as a free lunch."
Mr. Zelenty owned the greatest of treasures any of us could imagine because it combined those two passions. He had asked Mr. Friedman to sign his Monopoly board at one of those sherry hours. The Nobel laureate did so, writing, "Down with" above the game's name. We didn't play on that board. No one ever played on that board. (Mr. Zelenty said he still has it and wants to donate the relic to the university one day. "It's in a place of safety more than a place of honor," he said.)
The precise details of our classic game are blurred by the alcohol consumed that night and the years that have passed since then, but this much is recalled. We decided that Monopoly was hostile to a free market because it restricted the number of houses or hotels one could buy. We voted that a player could buy as many hotels as a property could physically bear and rents would be raised proportionally.
But the bank soon began to run out of money. So we did what any government would do. We began printing more of it, by scribbling $500 on scraps of paper. We printed a lot of money.
Prices shot up, which we all knew, even in that inebriated state, was the consequence of expanding the money supply. (After all, the great economist told us, "Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon.")
The inflation became so extreme that we eventually voted to alter the rules again: we'd cut the money supply. Any money we printed that came back to the bank would be taken out of circulation.
A severe depression kicked in, of course. Prices plummeted and it was a race to liquidate assets. One by one the players quickly went bankrupt, and sometime around 4 that morning the game was over.
Who won has long been forgotten, but it was one of the greatest games of Monopoly ever played because we got to change the rules.
Correction: February 27, 2011, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Sunday about the popularity of the game Monopoly at the University of Chicago in the 1970s misspelled the name of a snack bar run by Shorey House, a dormitory. It was Tanstaafl, an abbreviation of "there ain't no such thing as a free lunch" -- a favorite expression of the economics professor Milton Friedman.

Full text: Stocks advanced Friday, giving the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index its third consecutive weekly rally, as higher-than-estimated corporate earnings overshadowed the Chinese central bank's attempts to control inflation.
For the week, the Dow industrials and the Nasdaq were up a fraction of a percentage point.
United States stocks have risen three consecutive days, sending the S.& P. 500 to a 32-month high, as improving corporate earnings and manufacturing data overshadowed higher-than-forecast growth in consumer prices. Per-share earnings topped estimates at 72 percent of the 395 companies in the S.& P. 500 that reported results since Jan. 10, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
"There's a bullish bias in the market fueled by higher-than-expected earnings," said Frederic Dickson, chief market strategist at D. A. Davidson & Company in Lake Oswego, Ore.
"People are waking up and realizing that things are stabilizing so they need to put money to work. There might be some optimism that China will not have a tsunami. There's a perception that by moving slowly and steadily they can curb growth back to a reasonable rate."
Earlier in the day, stock index futures fell as China's central bank raised reserve requirements for lenders 10 days after raising interest rates to fight inflation.
Interest rates were steady. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 2/32, to 100 12/32, and the yield rose to 3.58 percent to 3.57 percent late Thursday.
Stocks of raw-materials producers had the biggest decline in the S.& P. 500 within 10 industries, dropping 1 percent.
The S.& P. 500 rose 2.58 points, or 0.19 percent, to 1,343.01. The index climbed 1 percent this week and needs to rise 0.7 percent, to 1,353.06, to complete a 100 percent rally from its March 2009 low.
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 73.11 points, or 0.59 percent, to 12,391.25. The Nasdaq composite index rose 2.37 points, or 0.08 percent, to 2,833.95.
The stock market will be closed on Monday for the Presidents' Day holiday.
On Friday, Caterpillar shares rose 2.4 percent, the biggest gain in the Dow average, to $105.86. The company said retail sales of machinery rose 49 percent worldwide in the three-month period ending in January.
Shares in Intuit, the maker of tax software, rose 7.3 percent -- the biggest gain in the S.& P. 500 on Friday -- to $54.11. It raised its forecast for full-year profit excluding one-time items to as much as $2.48. The average analyst prediction in a Bloomberg survey is for earnings of $2.41 cents a share.
Stock in Brocade Communications Systems rose 6 percent, to $6.38. The company, which makes switches for data-storage networks, forecast earnings of 10 cents a share excluding some items in its fiscal second quarter, beating the 9-cent average analyst estimate in a Bloomberg survey.
Apple shares fell 2.2 percent, to $350.56. The Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission are beginning to examine whether Apple's new media subscription service violates antitrust laws.
Shares of Campbell Soup sank 3.9 percent, to $33.58. Sales may fall as much as 1 percent, the company said. That compared with a previous forecast of at least a 1 percent gain. Earnings per share will fall as much as 3 percent, compared with an earlier target of a gain for up to 4 percent.
Fertilizer stocks slid on Friday as the price of wheat declined for a third time in four days on speculation that China's demand for grain and oilseed will ease after the country took steps to curb inflation.
CF Industries, a leading maker of nitrogen fertilizer, lost 6.7 percent, to $137.87. Mosaic shares fell 4.3 percent, to $83.02. And Monsanto, the world's largest seed company, lost 2.4 percent, to $72.39.
Policy makers from the Group of 20, at odds over global economic imbalances, confront a new threat as higher inflation is rippling from emerging markets to advanced economies.
A report of greater-than-expected United States inflation on Thursday followed an increase in the European cost-of-living index to a two-year high and a pickup in Chinese prices, further fraying a tentative global consensus over how to sustain the recovery.
The euro rose to a one-week high against the United States dollar after Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, a member of the executive board of the European Central Bank, said the bank might need to raise interest rates as global inflation pressure mounts.

Full text: PARIS -- With the world's economies moving at two different speeds, fast-growing developing countries are luring money at a pace that, if left unchecked, could set the stage for future problems, the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said Friday.
Mr. Bernanke also defended again the Fed's steps to bolster economic growth in the United States, this time at a central banking conference here before a meeting of the Group of 20 finance ministers and central bankers. The Fed has kept interest rates low and made money more available to encourage domestic growth even as many other countries have grown increasingly worried about inflationary pressures and taken some steps to curb growth.
China and other emerging markets have blamed the Fed's strategy for sending waves of capital rushing to their shores, creating a threat of inflation. But Mr. Bernanke said the influx of capital appeared to be driven more by investors' desire to get a higher return in emerging economies than by the Fed's policies.
He admonished emerging nations to acknowledge that they have "a strong interest in a continued economic recovery in the advanced economies," and said they should consider deploying their own tools -- including adjusting the level of their currency -- to manage their economies and prevent overheating.
Mr. Bernanke did not mention China in his remarks, although they appeared to be a veiled reference to Beijing's policy of keeping its currency, the renminbi, artificially low to gain a trade advantage. As Mr. Bernanke spoke, the Chinese central bank governor, Zhou Xiaochuan, appeared on the same stage.
The extent to which advanced economies are lagging emerging markets is a major preoccupation among policy makers here. The United States Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, told the group that forecasts for growth of about 5 to 7 percent in emerging markets, 3 to 4 percent in the United States, and 1 to 2 percent in Europe this year seemed accurate to him. The question, he said, was: "How do we get sustainable durable growth in the advanced economies?"
In a star-studded lineup from the world of economic policy makers, the central bank governors of Britain, France, Japan and China, as well as Jean-Claude Trichet, the governor of the European Central Bank, took turns underscoring their worry that the uneven nature of global growth could undermine the recovery.
Mervyn King, the governor of Britain's central bank, said China was pursuing structural reforms slowly while countries like the United States and Britain, facing the prospect of high unemployment, favor a quicker adjustment path. There is a risk, he added, that this conflict will result in persistently high levels of unemployment if advanced nations fall even further behind.
Mr. Bernanke said a way to address imbalances in global growth was for countries that export more than they import to allow their currencies to reflect overall economic performance. He also urged those with large trade deficits to increase their savings and put their fiscal policies on more sustainable paths.
The Fed chairman said countries maintaining undervalued currencies had "contributed to spending that's unbalanced and unsustainable," which, together with surging demand in fast-growing emerging markets, was fueling a worrisome rise in commodity prices.
"Spillovers can go both ways," Mr. Bernanke said. "Resurgent demand in the emerging markets has contributed significantly to the sharp recent run-up in global commodity prices."
Meanwhile, countries that have allowed market forces to determine the level of their money have been penalized by seeing their competitiveness erode, he said.
Mr. Zhou later appeared to concede the point, to a degree. He noted that Chinese exporters complained that they would all go out of businesses if the government were to allow the renminbi to rise by 3 percent. "But then that happens and then they survive," he said. In fact, he added, "they have room to improve and survive."
Policy makers in advanced economies have been calling on China to stoke demand from within its own country to even out its trade dominance. Mr. Zhou said China was working on that. "One day we'll have a domestic market too, depending on price elasticity," he said.
China could also shift from an export-dominated manufacturing economy to a more service-oriented one to meet domestic needs. "But that would be slow, it would take 10 years at best," Mr. Zhou said.
Officials from the Group of 20 are gathering here Friday and Saturday, and are trying to come to an agreement on a set of "indicators" to help identify when economic and financial developments in some countries would pose problems for all the others. Among other things, European officials have proposed monitoring a country's current-account balance, its public deficit and debt, the savings ratio, net foreign assets and real exchange rates.
But Beijing is fighting against using exchange rates and currency reserves as a measure. These have become an issue of contention for other countries that see China using its exchange rate to stoke exports, even as trade deficits and surpluses have started to rise in many countries.
"We're trying to build a system that has a better balance of exchange rate policy in large emerging countries," Mr. Geithner said.
Both China and Germany have batted down calls from the United States to cap current-account surpluses or deficits at a certain percentage of economic growth.
Christine Lagarde, the finance minister of France, which is presiding over the meeting this year, warned that if countries stuck to "business as usual," the world risked falling into a debt crisis.
"The more desirable scenario is that deficit countries curb and reduce debt, and surplus countries are prepared to boost their domestic demand," she said. "Where collective gains are possible, global growth would be reconciled by a reduction of imbalances," she said.
Officials are also focused on how to improve oversight of the banking system to mend problems that emerged from the recent financial crisis and prevent another one from emerging in the coming years.
"How do you fix oversight? That's the problem," Mr. Geithner said. "The rules have to be designed better and applied more uniformly across countries."
He said that the American system of overseeing its banks was "very complicated," and that it would be better to make oversight more integrated. But the United States approach of giving tough love to its banks seems to have worked: Citigroup and others, which taxpayers supported with huge bailouts during the depths of the crisis, have yielded a return to the Treasury.
Europe, by contrast, seems to have much less tolerance for allowing the failure of its financial institutions. European banks have been a source of worry as the region grapples with a sovereign debt crisis that has seen Greece and Ireland take bailouts, creating fears that many banks still face unreported losses.
At the same time, Mr. Geithner said Europe was making "some progress" in exiting the crisis, and noted that markets were showing "confidence that Europe is meeting the challenges."

Abstract: On Wednesday, the minutes from the latest meeting of Federal Reserve policy makers indicated that the Fed saw a decreasing risk of deflation and that it now expected economic growth of 3.4 to 3.9 percent this year, up from the previous forecast of 3 to 3.6 percent. Global food prices hit record levels in January, according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, and many emerging countries are taking steps to control inflation caused by those increases.

Full text: Higher energy costs helped push up consumer prices in the United States last month, according to government statistics released on Thursday, but inflation remained subdued. Economists said the new data showed that the risk of a protracted decline in prices had receded.
The Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index was up a seasonally adjusted 0.4 percent in January, and showed a 1.6 percent rise over the previous 12 months. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had expected an increase of 0.3 percent in January. Rising energy prices also led to a rise in prices for December, when the index was up 0.4 percent, a revision based on seasonally adjusted data.
In another report, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank said factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region rose to its highest level in seven years.
The Fed's business activity index rose to 35.9 in February, from 19.3 the month before. It was the highest reading since January 2004. Economists surveyed by Reuters had forecast a reading of 20.9.
Energy prices were the most striking feature of the Labor Department's price report for a second month. Gasoline was up 3.5 percent in January, compared with 6.7 percent in December. Fuel oil was up 6.8 percent in January after a 4.9 percent rise in December. Food rose 0.5 percent in January, a sharper rate than in the last several months.
"It is pretty clear that right now the worst of deflationary concerns are behind us," said Dan Greenhaus, the chief economic strategist for Miller Tabak & Company.
"There has been a rebound pretty much across the board," he added. "Going forward, increases in commodity prices, improvements in the labor market and a stabilization in the housing component lends an upward bias to C.P.I. during the course of the year."
The core index, which excludes food and energy, rose 0.2 percent in January and was up 1 percent for the previous 12 months. A 1 percent rise in apparel prices accounted for the acceleration in the core index, the figures showed.
Stuart Hoffman, the chief economist at PNC, said the core rate was "a long way from the Fed's preferred range" of about 2 percent or slightly lower.
"You can stop talking about deflation now," he said. "The odds were always fairly low but now they are slim to none."
He added, "The debate will be how fast inflation is going to move up but I don't think it is going to meet or exceed 2 percent in the next couple of years."
The concern about deflation was a principal factor behind the decision by the Federal Reserve in August to carry out its bond purchasing program.
On Wednesday, the minutes from the latest meeting of Federal Reserve policy makers indicated that the Fed saw a decreasing risk of deflation and that it now expected economic growth of 3.4 to 3.9 percent this year, up from the previous forecast of 3 to 3.6 percent.
Although food and energy prices have increased, the Fed minutes said, especially in fast-growing emerging markets, the committee did not have a consensus on whether that development would lead to higher inflation in the United States.
The Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, has been adamant in saying that the Fed was ready and willing to curb inflation -- and could even raise interest rates at a moment's notice if it needed to.
On Wednesday, the Labor Department reported that producer prices in the United States rose in January. The core index, which excludes the volatile food and energy sectors, rose 0.5 percent, the biggest jump in 27 months, the agency said.
Food companies, retailers and manufacturers have begun warning that rising prices are expected to start hitting consumers, with economists forecasting inflation in the United States to run about 2.5 percent this year.
Economists have also been watching for any resurgence in hiring by companies, hoping that stronger consumer spending will help the recovery gain momentum. On Thursday, the Labor Department said the number of people filing for unemployment benefits rose to 410,000 in the most recent week, up 25,000 from the previous week. The figure is 10,000 higher than the consensus forecast of economists.
Prices for commodities, including cotton, corn, steel and copper, have surged in recent months. Global food prices hit record levels in January, according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, and many emerging countries are taking steps to control inflation caused by those increases.
In Britain, inflation hit its highest level in two years when it reached an annual rate of 4 percent in January, above the Bank of England's inflation target of 2 percent, according to the Office for National Statistics. Higher commodity and energy prices and an increase in the sales tax were blamed.
China said this week that consumer prices rose 4.9 percent in January, and many economists predict that China's inflation will not peak for two or three more months, forcing the government to take stronger measures that could slow economic growth.

Full text: Strong earnings results and another round of corporate deals pushed stocks higher on Wednesday. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has now doubled from the intraday low set during the 2008 financial crisis.
Family Dollar Stores, the discount retailer, rose 21.13 percent, to $53.25, after the firm, run by the investor Nelson W. Peltz, offered to pay up to $60 a share to take it private. That was a 36 percent premium from Tuesday's closing price. Family Dollar gained the most of any stock in the S. & P. 500 index.
Genzyme, the biotechnology company, rose 1.07 percent after the French drug maker Sanofi-Aventisagreed to buy it for more than $20 billion in cash. The deal ended months of haggling between the companies.
Dell climbed 11.86 percent a day after it raised its full-year revenue forecast, a sign that businesses are spending more on technology.
Abercrombie & Fitch, the teenage clothing retailer, rose 7.58 percent after reporting that its fourth-quarter net income nearly doubled on strong sales overseas and better results in the United States.
Comcast also reported earnings that surpassed analysts' expectations. Its stock increased 4.01 percent after more customers signed up for a combination of TV, high-speed Internet access and digital phone services.
The equipment maker Deere rose 2.39 percent after it said its net income more than doubled, helped by growing sales of large farm machinery in the United States and Canada.
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 61.53 points, or 0.50 percent, to end at 12,288.17, its highest close since June 13, 2008.
The S.& P. 500 finished up 8.31 points, or 0.63 percent, at 1,336.32. That was double its intraday low of 666.79, reached on March 6, 2008, at the height of the financial crisis.
The Nasdaq composite index rose 21.21 points, or 0.76 percent, to 2,825.56.
Interest rates were steady. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 4/32, to 100 1/32, and the yield rose to 3.62 percent from 3.60 percent late Tuesday.
The Commerce Department reported that new home construction rose in January by the largest amount in 20 months. The pace of construction is still below levels seen in a healthy economy, but analysts were optimistic about the report.
"Housing is slowly showing some signs of life here," said Ryan Detrick, senior technical strategist at Schaeffer's Investment Research.
The Labor Department also reported that wholesale prices rose sharply in January as a result of higher costs for gas and other goods.
Oil prices increased after Israel's foreign minister said that Iran would send two warships through the Suez Canal on the way to Syria. Benchmark oil for March delivery rose 67 cents to settle at $84.99 a barrel.
The Federal Reserve reported separately that for the fifth straight month factories produced more goods in January, although overall industrial production fell. The Fed also released minutes from its policy meeting last month showing that Fed officials unanimously concluded that inflation was not yet a problem. They also raised their forecast for economic growth this year.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- As the players here remake the nation's vast regulatory system, they have been grappling with a subject that is more the province of poets and philosophers than bureaucrats: what is the value of a human life?
The answer determines how much spending the government should require to prevent a single death.
To protests from business and praise from unions, environmentalists and consumer groups, one agency after another has ratcheted up the price of life, justifying tougher -- and more costly -- standards.
The Environmental Protection Agencyset the value of a life at $9.1 million last year in proposing tighter restrictions on air pollution. The agency used numbers as low as $6.8 million during the George W. Bush administration.
The Food and Drug Administration declared that life was worth $7.9 million last year, up from $5 million in 2008, in proposing warning labels on cigarette packages featuring images of cancer victims.
The Transportation Department has used values of around $6 million to justify recent decisions to impose regulations that the Bush administration had rejected as too expensive, like requiring stronger roofs on cars.
And the numbers may keep climbing. In December, the E.P.A. said it might set the value of preventing cancer deaths 50 percent higher than other deaths, because cancer kills slowly. A report last year financed by the Department of Homeland Security suggested that the value of preventing deaths from terrorism might be 100 percent higher than other deaths.
The trend is a sensitive subject for an administration that is trying to improve its relationship with the business community, much of which has bitterly opposed the expansion of regulation. The White House said the decisions on the value of life were made by the agencies. The agencies, for their part, referred any questions to the White House.
"This administration utilizes the best available science in assessing the benefits and costs of any potential regulation, drawing on widely accepted methodologies that have been in use for years," Meg Reilly, a spokeswoman for the Office of Management and Budget, which oversees the rule-making process, said in an e-mail.
Several independent experts, however, said that the increases were long overdue, noting that some agencies had been using the same values for more than a decade without adjusting for inflation. One office at the E.P.A. cut the value of life in 2004.
"Agencies have been using numbers that I thought were just too low," said W. Kip Viscusi, a professor of economics at Vanderbilt University whose research is cited by most of the federal agencies as the basis for their calculations.
Businesses would prefer to discuss the consequences of the increases -- new regulations and higher costs, which they say are hampering economic growth -- rather than suggest that the government has overstated the value of life.
But some industry representatives said assigning a value to life was inherently subjective, and that the recent changes were driven by the administration's pursuit of its regulatory agenda rather than scientific considerations.
"It looks like they just cooked the books -- they just doubled the numbers," said Todd Spencer, executive vice president of the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association, a trade group for the trucking industry, which faces higher costs under some of the Transportation Department's new rules. The Bush administration rejected a plan in 2005 to make car companies double the roof strength of new vehicles, which it estimated might prevent 135 deaths in rollover accidents each year.
At the time, Transportation officials figured that the cost of the roofs would exceed the value of lives saved by almost $800 million. So the agency proposed a smaller increase in roof strength that might save 44 lives a year.
Last year, the Obama administration imposed the stricter and more expensive roof-strength standard, and it published a new set of calculations showing that the benefits outstripped the costs.
Most of the difference came from the increased value of human life. By raising that number to $6.1 million from a figure of $3.5 million in the original study, the Obama administration rendered those 135 lives -- and hundreds of averted injuries -- more valuable than the roofs.
The pattern of increases is scrambling a long-standing political dynamic. The business community historically has pushed for regulators to put a dollar value on life, part of a broader campaign to make agencies prove that the benefits of proposed regulations exceed the costs.
But some business groups are reconsidering the effectiveness of cost-benefit analysis as a check on regulations. The United States Chamber of Commerce is now campaigning for Congress to assert greater control over the rule-making process, reflecting a judgment that formulas may offer less reliable protection than politicians.
Some consumer groups, meanwhile, find themselves cheering the government's results but reluctant to embrace the method. Advocates for increased regulation have long argued that cost-benefit analysis understates both the value of life and the benefits of government oversight.
"If analysis is going to be imposed on the rule-making process, we want higher values for injury and for fatalities," said Robert Weissman, president of Public Citizen, which pushed the Transportation Department to reconsider the roof-strength regulation.
But Mr. Weissman said he still believed that such analysis was an impediment to necessary regulation.
"The bigger picture is absent," he said. "How do you do cost-benefit analysis on global warming? It constrains the imagination. It really is a constraint in terms of bounding what is given serious consideration."
The current rise in the value of life is based on the work of Professor Viscusi, who wrote his first paper on cost-benefit analysis as a Harvard undergraduate in the early 1970s. He won a prize and found a career.
The idea he and others have since developed in a long string of studies is that differences in wages show the value that workers place on avoiding the risk of death. Say that companies must pay lumberjacks an additional $1,000 a year to perform work that generally kills one in 1,000 workers. It follows that most Americans would forgo $1,000 a year to avoid that risk -- and that 1,000 Americans will collectively forgo $1 million to avoid the same risk entirely. That number is said to be the "statistical value of life."
Professor Viscusi's work pegs it at around $8.7 million in current dollars.
Before the current administration, only the E.P.A. had fully embraced this methodology. Other agencies relied instead on the results of surveys asking Americans how much they would spend to avoid a given risk. This technique tends to produce significantly lower results. An even older technique, which yields even lower numbers, is to sum the wages lost when a worker dies. In 2000 the E.P.A set a baseline of $7.8 million, updated to current dollars. But in 2004, the office that issues clean air regulations reduced that baseline by $500,000 in an analysis of proposed limits on emissions from industrial boilers.
Last year, the E.P.A. directed its various offices to return to the 2000 baseline, adjusting that figure for inflation and wage growth. In some recent studies, the E.P.A. has used a figure of $9.1 million after making those adjustments.
The agency said at the same time that it was working to set a new standard. In a white paper issued in December, it raised the possibility that people might place a higher value on avoiding a slow death from cancer than a quick death in a car accident. It also broached a concept it described as "altruism," the idea that people may place a higher value on the common good than on their own survival.
John D. Graham, who oversaw the use of cost-benefit analysis during the George W. Bush administration, said that the scientific justification was "quite strong" for raising the values used by the Transportation Department, but he cautioned that the E.P.A. was going too far.
"Why should the same clinical condition be valued differently at different federal agencies?" Mr. Graham, now dean of the School of Environmental and Public Affairs at Indiana University, asked in an e-mailed response to questions.
Many experts similarly ask why life itself should be valued differently. Agencies are allowed to set their own numbers. The E.P.A. and the Transportation Department use numbers that are $3 million apart. The process generally involves experts, but the decisions ultimately are made by political appointees.
The Office of Management and Budget told agencies in 2004 that they should pick a number between $1 million and $10 million. That guidance remains in effect, although the office has more recently warned agencies that it would be difficult to justify the use of numbers under $5 million, two administration officials said.
Close observers of the process point to two reasons for the variation in numbers. First, they say that setting a single standard is not worth the high-stakes battle that would be required with advocates on both sides. The Obama administration, like its predecessors, has preferred to deal with the issue informally, on an agency-by-agency basis.
Second, they say the lack of a standard preserves flexibility.
The Food and Drug Administration issued a rule in 2009 requiring new warning labels on packages and bottles of acetaminophen and other drugs. Its justification valued life at $5 million. A few months later, the agency acknowledged that it had calculated the cost of adding one new label, while requiring two new labels. However, the agency continued, the benefits still exceeded the costs because the value of life was $7 million.
A few months later, in an unrelated rule regarding salmonella, the agency once again cited a value of $5 million, which it said best reflected the available research. And in its recent study on cigarette labels, the agency cited a value of $7.9 million.
"The reality is that politics frequently trumps economics," said Robert Hahn, a leading scholar of the American regulatory process who is now a professor at the University of Manchester in England. But he said that putting a price tag on life still was worthwhile, to help politicians choose among priorities and to shape the details of their proposals.
"Even small changes," he said, "can save billions of dollars."

Full text: LONDON -- Inflation in Britain rose to 4 percent in January, the highest level in two years, after the government increased a sales tax and the price of oil rose.
The annual rate, up from 3.7 percent in December, was twice the Bank of England's inflation target of 2 percent, the Office for National Statistics said on Tuesday.
Mervyn King, as the governor of the Bank of England, is required to write to the Treasury every three months whenever inflation moves away from the bank's 2 percent target by more than one percentage point in either direction. Mr. King wrote his fifth such letter in a year.
In the letter, he blamed higher commodity and energy prices and an increase in the sales tax for the price increases. He also said inflation could rise to almost 5 percent in the next few months, higher than the Bank of England had predicted.
But Mr. King repeated his view that the inflation rate probably would recede in 2012.
"There is a great deal of uncertainty about the medium-term outlook for inflation," he wrote. "As the temporary effects of the factors listed above wane, inflation will fall back so that it is about as likely to be above the target as below it two to three years ahead."
The pace of consumer price increases exceeded the central bank's target for a 14th consecutive month, heightening pressure on its Monetary Policy Committee to consider raising interest rates, although Britain's economy shrank in the fourth quarter of last year.
Inflation in Britain is higher than in the United States and in the euro region. At the same time, some economists warned that raising rates too soon could jeopardize Britain's fragile economy.
"This is another kick in the teeth on the inflation front for the Bank of England, albeit slightly less hard than some had feared," Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, wrote in a note to clients. "It maintains pressure on the bank to retaliate by raising interest rates sooner rather than later."
The largest price increases were in fuel, restaurants, alcoholic drinks and cars, the statistics office said. Costs for DVDs, clothing and banking services declined. The office said the price increases were caused mainly by an increase in the value-added tax, to 20 percent from 17.5 percent, in January.
Britain's Treasury expects to raise about $:13 billion, or $21 billion, a year from the tax increase, which is part of an austerity package aimed at cutting the country's record budget deficit, $:160 billion, or 11.4 percent of gross domestic product.
The Bank of England kept its interest rates at 0.5 percent this month, but some committee members have already voted for an interest rate increase in light of rising inflation. One other member continued to push for more quantitative easing, however, warning that the economy was still too weak to withstand the far-reaching austerity measures the government planned.
In his letter, Mr. King said he did "not wish to conceal that there are real differences of view within the committee, reflecting different judgments about the risks."
Some economists had adjusted their views based on the rising inflation rate and now predict a rate increase sooner than before.
The Bank of England is expected to revise its inflation forecast when it publishes its inflation report Wednesday.

Full text: Washington
CALLS for greater government efficiency are nothing new in Washington. But with President Obama and Congress now debating budgets for both the rest of this year and the next, with the economy yet to fully recover from the recent recession and with our government's finances still on an unsustainable long-term path, the need to wring every dollar out of the federal budget and ensure that taxpayers are getting their money's worth has never been greater. How, though, do you find these savings?
Today, the Government Accountability Office is issuing its updated roadmap to confronting waste, fraud, abuse and mismanagement. Since we started this list of programs at high risk of such problems two decades ago, our office has come to update it with each new Congress, and history shows that sustained, focused oversight from lawmakers and administration officials can save billions of dollars and improve services. But while over one-third of the programs we listed previously have come off the list over the years, dozens of others have moved onto it. The latest high-risk list presents 30 areas ripe for Congress and President Obama to take action.
One new area on the list is the Interior Department's management of oil and gas leases and royalties, which are among the largest sources of non-tax revenue to the federal government. One reason this area is at risk is that the department does not have reasonable assurance that all revenues are being collected. Indeed, in 2008, the G.A.O. reported that the Interior Department had not conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the federal oil and gas revenue system in more than 25 years, despite significant changes in the oil and gas industry.
We have also pointed out that royalty collection relied too heavily on company-reported oil and gas production figures. In fiscal years 2006 and 2007 we found that much of the data reported by oil and gas companies appeared erroneous, resulting in millions in uncollected fees. And the proportion of revenues that the government collected for oil and gas produced in the Gulf of Mexico, according to a major study, was lower than for 93 of 104 other owners of such resources.
In recent years, the G.A.O. has made more than 50 recommendations to the interior secretary to improve the department's revenue collection and hiring, training and retaining staff policies and modify its practices for managing oil and gas resources. The Interior Department has been acting on some of these recommendations -- but there were many more that still need to be put into effect. As the G.A.O. and other institutions continue to examine these issues, additional problems and recommendations will likely be identified as well.
We are also dropping two issues from the high-risk list: the Department of Defense's personnel security clearance program, which processes hundreds of thousands of security clearances annually for service members and civilians, and the 2010 Census. Both dealt sufficiently with identified vulnerabilities to warrant their removal. Three factors contributed to this success: high-level support from agencies, clear measures with which to gauge progress and strong Congressional oversight. Credit goes to the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee for holding the agencies involved accountable.
Several other items remaining on the high-risk list illustrate the magnitude of the potential savings that are possible. For example, the Medicare and Medicaid programs need to add better detection and controls to curtail billions of dollars in improper payments.
In fiscal year 2010 alone, Medicare had estimated improper payments of almost $48 billion; this estimate did not include improper payments in its prescription drug benefit program, for which the agency has not yet determined a total amount. And because Medicare remains on a path that is fiscally unsustainable over the long term, there is heightened pressure to improve its payment methods, as well as its management and oversight of program operations and patient care.
As for Medicaid, it has taken steps to improve transparency and reduce improper payments in recent years, but more can be done. Improper payments to providers that submit inappropriate claims can result in substantial financial losses to states and the federal government. The Department of Health and Human Services has estimated a national improper payment rate for Medicaid of 9.4 percent (with the federal share estimated at $22.5 billion) for fiscal year 2010.
Certain services may be more susceptible than others to improper payments. For example, in 2009 the G.A.O. found that Medicaid beneficiaries and providers were involved in potentially wasteful or abusive purchases of controlled substances in five selected states. Specifically, we found that Medicaid paid over $2 million in controlled substance prescriptions during fiscal years 2006 and 2007 that were written or filled by 65 medical practitioners and pharmacies barred, excluded or both from federal health care programs, including Medicaid.
As a result, the G.A.O. recommended that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services issue guidelines to states for processes that better prevent payment of improper claims for controlled substances in Medicaid. The agency generally agreed with our recommendations -- yet such guidance had not been issued by the end of last year.
Billions more could flow to the Treasury through better enforcement of the tax laws and closing the gap between taxes owed and paid. Typically, about 84 percent of owed taxes are paid voluntarily and on time; in its most recent estimate, for 2001, the I.R.S. said the resulting net gap was $290 billion. Congress and the I.R.S. have taken innovative actions aimed at further improving tax compliance. The I.R.S. last year began putting in place regulations covering paid tax return preparers, an important step given the critical role they play in helping taxpayers meet their tax obligations. Congress also passed laws that require financial institutions to report information on foreign bank accounts, the cost basis of securities and merchants' credit card receipts.
Greater attention also needs to be paid to how the Pentagon acquires weapon systems. Each year, investments totaling hundreds of billions of dollars too often produce military equipment that is over budget, behind schedule or unable to meet the needs of our troops. The Government Accountability Office has previously reported that the growth in projected costs on the Defense Department's fiscal year 2008 portfolio of 96 defense acquisition programs was more than $303 billion (adjusted for inflation). In addition, the average delay in delivering initial capability was 22 months.
For 42 programs the G.A.O. assessed in depth in 2010, there was continued improvement in the amount of knowledge the department had on the technology, design and manufacturing of these weapons programs at key points in the acquisition process. Most programs, however, were still proceeding with less knowledge than best practices suggest, putting them at higher risk for cost growth and schedule delays.
Congress and top officials responsible for programs on the high-risk list have been willing to address these issues. For example, in 2009, Congress required that the Defense Department's weapons acquisition programs now reflect the basic elements of a knowledge-based acquisition approach and that programs with excessive cost growth be terminated. In addition, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates has proposed canceling major defense acquisition programs that have been plagued with cost and schedule problems.
OUR list also includes programs that are at risk not for financial reasons but because they need better management or broad transformation. Take information security, which the G.A.O. first identified as a government-wide problem in 1997. Our office in 2003 expanded this high-risk area to include critical elements -- like power distribution, water supply, telecommunications and emergency services -- that rely extensively on computerized information systems and electronic data to carry out their operations.
The security of these systems and data is essential to protecting national and economic security, and public health and safety; and at the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security and numerous other federal agencies, progress is being made. But cyber threats are growing and evolving, reported security incidents are rising and significant security deficiencies pervade federal systems that jeopardize the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the federal government's security and the information they process.
In addition, the administration and executive branch agencies have not yet fully carried out key actions that are intended to improve the current United States approach to cybersecurity: developing a comprehensive national strategy for addressing global cybersecurity and governance; creating a national and federal research and development agenda for improving cybersecurity; carrying out the near- and mid-term actions recommended by the 2009 cybersecurity policy review directed by the president and updating the national strategy for securing the information and communications infrastructure.
Top agency officials and the Office of Management and Budget have been working with the Government Accountability Office to make greater progress on the high-risk list, and continued Congressional oversight has been essential to this progress. By focusing on oversight and acting to reform these programs on the high-risk list, Congress and the White House send an important message: the public must receive the best possible return on every tax dollar spent. Closing our nation's fiscal gap will require broader budgetary changes and shared contributions. Greater efficiency and effectiveness in government can help ease that burden on the American people while preserving vital programs of importance to us all.

Full text: By the fall, people will most likely be paying more for each of them, as rising prices hit most consumer goods, say retailers, food companies and manufacturers of consumer products.
Cotton prices are near their highest level in more than a decade, after adjusting for inflation, and leather and polyester costs are jumping as well. Copper recently hit its highest level in about 40 years, and iron ore, used for steel, is fetching extremely high prices. Prices for corn, sugar, wheat, beef, pork and coffee are soaring. Labor overseas is becoming more expensive, meanwhile, and so are the utility bills to keep a factory running.
"There are cost pressures from virtually everywhere," said Wesley R. Card, the chief executive of the Jones Group, whose brands include Nine West and Anne Klein. After trying to keep retail prices flat or even lower during the recession, Jones says prices for its brands will climb 15 to 20 percent by autumn.
When commodity prices started to rise last summer, many manufacturers and retailers absorbed the costs, worried that shoppers would not pay higher prices during the competitive holiday season or while the economy was still fragile.
Many big companies, including Kraft, Polo Ralph Lauren and Hanes, say they cannot hold off any longer and must raise prices to protect some profits.
Whether shoppers will pay is unclear. "Consumers are not exactly in the frame of mind or economic circumstances to say 'Oh, pay whatever they ask,' " said Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist at MFR Inc. "There's going to be pushback."
Economists say the increases may eventually show up as inflation, though they are not yet projecting rates that would set off alarms. Despite some fears, inflation has been extremely low, at a rate of just 1.4 percent annually in December. Data for January will be released Thursday, but economists expect inflation will run about 2.5 percent this year.
Some do see the creeping signs of higher inflation, and warn that the Federal Reserve will need to raise interest rates or at least stop pumping more money into the economy. Others argue that such moves would choke off economic growth sorely needed to get companies hiring again.
For consumers, higher prices in stores means there will be a little less extra cash to spend. For companies, profits may be squeezed, making them a little less likely to invest in equipment or to hire aggressively.
"One has to think about these higher prices not as a reason for economic activity to get derailed," said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics, "but as a reason why the recovery is slower than might otherwise be the case."
Given that the price of a gallon of gas is now well over $3 on average, Americans may feel that they are already dealing with higher prices.
Adding to the cost of food won't greatly distort most household budgets. Food, gas, clothing, personal care products and cleaning and laundry supplies make up less than a quarter of household spending in the United States, according to government data.
People at the bottom of the income scale struggle more as these prices rise, of course, because a larger share of their spending is on such essentials.
To some, the prospect of modestly higher prices is no reason to worry. In fact, rising prices can indicate improving economic conditions. Greater demand from fast-growing countries like China has helped push up the costs of many raw materials -- though officials there are worried about inflationary pressures, as are some officials in Europe.
In the United States, the willingness of companies to raise prices shows they are feeling better about the domestic recovery.
The sharp rise in commodity prices since last year has not translated into all new records. Food commodity prices are about 8 percent below the high in the summer of 2008, while energy prices are less than half their zenith. Prices of a basket of other commodities are about 4 percent below the heights of mid-2008.
The cost of raw materials accounts for a small portion of the cost of most consumer goods, as labor, processing and packaging tend to make up a larger share of the price at the cash register. Foods like coffee, meat and milk, which are closer to raw materials, will probably show some of the biggest price jumps.
Companies that try to pass on all their costs could meet resistance. Although consumer spending has risen, unemployment remains at 9 percent, and average hourly earnings are up less than 2 percent over the last year.
"These companies are constantly walking a tightrope on how far do I go," said Jack Russo, a consumer goods analyst at Edward Jones. "Do I offset with price or other cost cuts, or do I just take it and have it eat into my profit margins?"
Already, rising raw material costs have cut into corporate profits. Kimberly-Clark, which makes Kleenex tissues and Huggies diapers, said fiber- and oil-based products had contributed to a small dip last quarter. Procter & Gamble said earnings fell slightly in the division that makes Crest toothpaste, as well as in its household brands unit, which makes Tide and Cascade.
Plenty of companies are indicating they will push up retail prices. Kraft, the largest United States food manufacturer with brands like Oscar Mayer, Velveeta and Ritz crackers, said it would raise prices on many products this year without saying which ones or how much.
Soaring prices for coffee have pushed up costs at the coffee shop. Starbucks said last fall that it would raise some prices. Sara Lee, which sells Hillshire Farms meat and Senseo coffee, said that it would, too, on many items.
Restaurants, which resisted raising prices to keep customers coming through the doors last year, are also fretting. They may take other steps too, like lowering thermostats, shrinking packaging or reducing portion sizes to minimize the sticker shock.
Meat prices have surged because of the cost of feed, a decision by farmers to raise fewer cattle and pigs, and strong demand worldwide as living standards rise. An epidemic of foot-and-mouth disease that devastated South Korean hog farms has led to a recent surge in orders for American pork.
This year, "you're going to have to raise prices to stay in business," said Len M. Steiner, owner of the Steiner Consulting Group, which works with restaurant companies on ingredient purchasing.
Whirlpool says consumers can expect to pay 8 to 10 percent more for its products starting April 1. Apparel companies like Polo Ralph Lauren and Brooks Brothers said they would raise prices this year. Hanes Brands, which has already done so, said prices on cotton-heavy products would rise again at the end of summer. If cotton costs stay high, Hanes products could have a cumulative 30 percent increase.
Some companies don't think they can get away with charging more. PepsiCo, which makes soft drinks and snacks, like Fritos, said it would be cautious.
Victoria's Secret is nudging prices ever so slightly, with panties rising from five for $25 to five for $25.50.
John D. Morris, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, said retailers would probably try to manage costs in myriad ways.
Prices rose significantly in the apparel sector from 1972 to 1974, driven by labor costs and commodity prices, he said.
"The retailers went on to have a pretty good year in '73," Mr. Morris said. "Sales were up, gross margins were flat, and profit margins were up a little bit. Retailers found a way."

Full text: Coal will never displace gold as jewelry. But it has started to outperform it as an investment.
While gold's steep rally is threatened by a return to normal monetary policy, surging demand from Asia is pushing coal prices skyward. For investors fearing higher inflation, coal may be golden.
Gold enthusiasts have every reason to feel smug. Those looking to it as a haven in troubled times have not been disappointed. As central bankers put to work the monetary printing presses since the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the price of gold has climbed 75 percent, to about $1,350 an ounce.
Still signs suggest the rally is running out of steam. Gold funds have started to have outflows, and the price is off its peak. The reversal could worsen for gold bugs. As markets anticipate an end to monetary easing, rising interest rates could lure investors away from gold. More buoyant equities also make gold look less alluring.
At first blush, coal looks like an implausible alternative. If storing gold is a hassle, coal is many times more difficult. A short ton of Appalachian coal fetches $75, compared with $43 million for the same weight in gold.
Even so, coal has considerable appeal for investors seeking an inflation hedge and exposure to commodities. Flooding in the coal-rich Queensland, Australia, has been just the latest bullish development. Long after Australian mines recover, demand from India and China will continue to underpin prices. The two countries recently emerged as the greediest importers of coal, buying 10 times more from overseas than in 2003. And India's coal minister contends demand will triple over 20 years.
Of course, coal has drawbacks, too. Futures contracts are less liquid than gold or oil, making them potentially hard to exit. And all listed American coal companies together are worth just $60 billion -- less than a sixth the size of Exxon Mobil.
But despite a modest retreat in January, Australian coal has already slightly outpaced gold this year, up 30 percent, and American coal producers have had more impressive gains. As an investment, coal has been neglected for too long.
Blaming Bernanke
Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, has not turned anyone into a newt. Yet detractors do seem to think his policies have bewitched the world in realms far beyond central banking. Mr. Bernanke is influential, and his policies are open to criticism. But not every global problem can be laid at his door.
The low point came recently when he had to defend the Fed's ultraeasy monetary policy against grumbling that it was causing food prices to spike and therefore fomenting unrest in Tunisia and Egypt. The Fed's extensive bond-buying exercise, called quantitative easing, was unlikely to have been on the lips of protesters in Tahrir Square.
It is even a stretch to argue that quantitative easing has bailed out financially struggling states, as Representative Joe Walsh of Illinois contended at a hearing last week. The Fed may be trying to keep interest rates low, but state and local governments are paying on average almost a percentage point more in interest for debt maturing in 10 years than they were when the most recent quantitative easing exercise began in November.
In fact, to listen to Mr. Bernanke's critics, there are few problems for which he cannot be held responsible. By their logic, lax monetary policy is solely to blame for emerging inflation in Asia, and rising protectionism and asset bubbles in emerging markets.
Despite the Fed's undoubted influence, other powerful forces are surely at work. Mr. Bernanke's Washington neighbors in the White House and in Congress are perpetuating America's fiscal problems. On the other side of the world, the Chinese government is keeping its currency unsustainably weak.
And healthy growth in Asia and Latin America is bound to create demand for energy, food and commodities -- and therefore generate upward pressure on prices -- regardless of monetary policy in the United States. Repression, failed domestic policies and local power struggles are more credible factors in Middle Eastern unrest.
Even so, in the eyes of many, Mr. Bernanke is not helping, and the Fed's untested quantitative easing program could certainly backfire. But by giving him the full pointed hat and broomstick treatment, critics are suggesting other big cracks in the system can magically disappear. That is a dangerous illusion to uphold.

Full text: Investors remain nervous about the longer-term picture in the Middle East, but the easing of tensions in Egypt removes one major worry for global markets and could encourage further gains in the short term, analysts say.
A more stable situation would allow portfolio managers in the United States to focus on some underlying positives this week, including the improving economy and stronger earnings growth, said Byron R. Wien, a veteran market strategist at the Blackstone Group.
"The short-term conclusion is that the upheaval is over, and that's good for stocks," said Mr. Wien. "Exports are good, it looks like the consumer is beginning to spend again, unemployment is coming down and capital spending is strong."
The coming week is set to be a busy one in terms of clues to the economy's direction, with data on retail sales coming out on Tuesday and the government announcing the latest figures on consumer prices on Thursday. Inflation is increasingly a concern in fast-growing emerging markets like China and India, but for now price pressures are expected to remain in check in the United States, with core consumer prices estimated to be up just 0.1 percent.
In addition, new figures for housing starts will be released on Wednesday, while the latest read on leading economic indicators will come on Thursday.
Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist of Standard & Poor's Equity Research, said he expected the data to show the economy was strengthening. Economically sensitive sectors like industrials, energy and technology have been among the stock market's strongest performers so far in 2011.
Indeed, estimates for gross domestic product growth in the United States for 2011 have been creeping up from about 3 percent to closer to 4 percent, in part because of the $858 billion in tax cuts and incentives that Congress passed in December. There is also optimism that unemployment could sink below its current level of 9 percent.
Those are among the reasons that American stocks have gotten off to a strong start this year, with the S. & P. 500-stock index rising 5.7 percent, the best annual opening since 1998. In fact, Mr. Wien said, after a long period of outflows from stocks to bonds, mutual fund investors have started putting money into equity funds again.
Mr. Stovall added that with concerns about the Middle East ebbing, the recent flight to safety that has lifted the dollar could reverse, helping the euro regain a bit of ground it had lost on worries about excessive debt.
Oil prices are also expected to be closely watched this week. Though crude fell sharply on Friday after President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt announced his decision to step down, indications that political unrest was reawakening in Yemen and spreading to Algeria are likely to keep energy prices volatile.
Unlike Egypt and Tunisia, both of which have now seen governments topple, Algeria is a major energy producer and member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
"This is a relief rally, but there is a long road ahead," said Ann Wyman, head of emerging markets research in Europe for Nomura. "There is a worry about which country may be next and that this isn't the end of the story."
Nevertheless, the resolution to the standoff in Egypt provided global markets with a bit of a lift. In Asia on Monday, stock markets broadly rose, with the Nikkei 225 index in Japan up 0.8 percent by midday.
Stocks in the United States rallied on Friday after news of Mr. Mubarak's decision to step down broke, and the upward trend continued on Sunday, as bourses in the Middle East also rose, with shares in Abu Dhabi up 0.6 percent and the QE index in Qatar edging higher by 0.7 percent.
The Egyptian stock market has been closed since Jan. 27 but is set to reopen on Wednesday, and many observers expect it to bounce back as well. In what could also be a bullish indicator, Egypt successfully completed a $1.1 billion bond offering Sunday.

Full text: CORRECTION APPENDED
CAIRO -- As protesters in Tahrir Square faced off against pro-government forces, they drew a lesson from their counterparts in Tunisia: "Advice to the youth of Egypt: Put vinegar or onion under your scarf for tear gas."
The exchange on Facebook was part of a remarkable two-year collaboration that has given birth to a new force in the Arab world -- a pan-Arab youth movement dedicated to spreading democracy in a region without it. Young Egyptian and Tunisian activists brainstormed on the use of technology to evade surveillance, commiserated about torture and traded practical tips on how to stand up to rubber bullets and organize barricades.
They fused their secular expertise in social networks with a discipline culled from religious movements and combined the energy of soccer fans with the sophistication of surgeons. Breaking free from older veterans of the Arab political opposition, they relied on tactics of nonviolent resistance channeled from an American scholar through a Serbian youth brigade -- but also on marketing tactics borrowed from Silicon Valley.
As their swelling protests shook the Egyptian state, they were locked in a virtual tug of war with a leader with a very different vision -- Gamal Mubarak, the son of President Hosni Mubarak, a wealthy investment banker and ruling-party power broker. Considered the heir apparent to his father until the youth revolt eliminated any thought of dynastic succession, the younger Mubarak pushed his father to hold on to power even after his top generals and the prime minister were urging an exit, according to American officials who tracked Hosni Mubarak's final days.
The defiant tone of the president's speech on Thursday, the officials said, was largely his son's work.
"He was probably more strident than his father was," said one American official, who characterized Gamal's role as "sugarcoating what was for Mubarak a disastrous situation." But the speech backfired, prompting Egypt's military to force the president out and assert control of what they promise will be a transition to civilian government.
Now the young leaders are looking beyond Egypt. "Tunis is the force that pushed Egypt, but what Egypt did will be the force that will push the world," said Walid Rachid, one of the members of the April 6 Youth Movement, which helped organize the Jan. 25 protests that set off the uprising. He spoke at a meeting on Sunday night where the members discussed sharing their experiences with similar youth movements in Libya, Algeria, Morocco and Iran.
"If a small group of people in every Arab country went out and persevered as we did, then that would be the end of all the regimes," he said, joking that the next Arab summit might be "a coming-out party" for all the ascendant youth leaders.
Bloggers Lead the Way
The Egyptian revolt was years in the making. Ahmed Maher, a 30-year-old civil engineer and a leading organizer of the April 6 Youth Movement, first became engaged in a political movement known as Kefaya, or Enough, in about 2005. Mr. Maher and others organized their own brigade, Youth for Change. But they could not muster enough followers; arrests decimated their leadership ranks, and many of those left became mired in the timid, legally recognized opposition parties. "What destroyed the movement was the old parties," said Mr. Maher, who has since been arrested four times.
By 2008, many of the young organizers had retreated to their computer keyboards and turned into bloggers, attempting to raise support for a wave of isolated labor strikes set off by government privatizations and runaway inflation.
After a strike that March in the city of Mahalla, Egypt, Mr. Maher and his friends called for a nationwide general strike for April 6. To promote it, they set up a Facebook group that became the nexus of their movement, which they were determined to keep independent from any of the established political groups. Bad weather turned the strike into a nonevent in most places, but in Mahalla a demonstration by the workers' families led to a violent police crackdown -- the first major labor confrontation in years.
Just a few months later, after a strike in Tunisia, a group of young online organizers followed the same model, setting up what became the Progressive Youth of Tunisia. The organizers in both countries began exchanging their experiences over Facebook. The Tunisians faced a more pervasive police state than the Egyptians, with less latitude for blogging or press freedom, but their trade unions were stronger and more independent. "We shared our experience with strikes and blogging," Mr. Maher recalled.
For their part, Mr. Maher and his colleagues began reading about nonviolent struggles. They were especially drawn to a Serbian youth movement called Otpor, which had helped topple the dictator Slobodan Milosevic by drawing on the ideas of an American political thinker, Gene Sharp. The hallmark of Mr. Sharp's work is well-tailored to Mr. Mubark's Egypt: He argues that nonviolence is a singularly effective way to undermine police states that might cite violent resistance to justify repression in the name of stability.
The April 6 Youth Movement modeled its logo -- a vaguely Soviet looking red and white clenched fist--after Otpor's, and some of its members traveled to Serbia to meet with Otpor activists.
Another influence, several said, was a group of Egyptian expatriates in their 30s who set up an organization in Qatar called the Academy of Change, which promotes ideas drawn in part on Mr. Sharp's work. One of the group's organizers, Hisham Morsy, was arrested during the Cairo protests and remained in detention.
"The Academy of Change is sort of like Karl Marx, and we are like Lenin," said Basem Fathy, another organizer who sometimes works with the April 6 Youth Movement and is also the project director at the Egyptian Democratic Academy, which receives grants from the United States and focuses on human rights and election-monitoring. During the protesters' occupation of Tahrir Square, he said, he used his connections to raise about $5,100 from Egyptian businessmen to buy blankets and tents.
'This Is Your Country'
Then, about a year ago, the growing Egyptian youth movement acquired a strategic ally, Wael Ghonim, a 31-year-old Google marketing executive. Like many others, he was introduced into the informal network of young organizers by the movement that came together around Mohamed ElBaradei, the Nobel Prize-winning diplomat who returned to Egypt a year ago to try to jump-start its moribund political opposition.
Mr. Ghonim had little experience in politics but an intense dislike for the abusive Egyptian police, the mainstay of the government's power. He offered his business savvy to the cause. "I worked in marketing, and I knew that if you build a brand you can get people to trust the brand," he said.
The result was a Facebook group Mr. Ghonim set up: We Are All Khalid Said, after a young Egyptian who was beaten to death by police. Mr. Ghonim -- unknown to the public, but working closely with Mr. Maher of the April 6 Youth Movement and a contact from Mr. ElBaradei's group -- said that he used Mr. Said's killing to educate Egyptians about democracy movements.
He filled the site with video clips and newspaper articles about police violence. He repeatedly hammered home a simple message: "This is your country; a government official is your employee who gets his salary from your tax money, and you have your rights." He took special aim at the distortions of the official media, because when the people "distrust the media then you know you are not going to lose them," he said.
He eventually attracted hundreds of thousands of users, building their allegiance through exercises in online democratic participation. When organizers planned a "day of silence" in the Cairo streets, for example, he polled users on what color shirts they should all wear -- black or white. (When the revolt exploded, the Mubarak government detained him for 12 days in blindfolded isolation in a belated attempt to stop his work.)
After the Tunisian revolution on Jan. 14, the April 6 Youth Movement saw an opportunity to turn its little-noticed annual protest on Police Day -- the Jan. 25 holiday that celebrates a police revolt that was suppressed by the British -- into a much bigger event. Mr. Ghonim used the Facebook site to mobilize support. If at least 50,000 people committed to turn out that day, the site suggested, the protest could be held. More than 100,000 signed up.
"I have never seen a revolution that was preannounced before," Mr. Ghonim said.
By then, the April 6 movement had teamed up with Mr. ElBaradei's supporters, some liberal and leftist parties, and the youth wing of the Muslim Brotherhood to plaster Cairo with eye-catching modernist posters advertising their Tunisia-inspired Police Day protest. But their elders -- even members of the Brotherhood who had long been portrayed as extremists by Mr. Mubarak and the West -- shied away from taking to the streets.
Explaining that Police Day was supposed to honor the fight against British colonialism, Essem Erian, a Brotherhood leader, said, "On that day we should all be celebrating together.
"All these people are on Facebook, but do we know who they are?" he asked. "We cannot tie our parties and entities to a virtual world."
'This Was It'
When the 25th came, the coalition of young activists, almost all of them affluent, wanted to tap into the widespread frustration with the country's autocracy, and also with the grinding poverty of Egyptian life. They started their day trying to rally poor people with complaints about pocketbook issues: "They are eating pigeon and chicken, but we eat beans every day."
By the end of the day, when tens of thousands had marched to Tahrir Square, their chants had become more sweeping. "The people want to bring down the regime," they shouted, a slogan that the organizers said they had read in signs and on Facebook pages from Tunisia. Mr. Maher of the April 6 Youth Movement said the organizers even debated storming Parliament and the state television building -- classic revolutionary moves.
"When I looked around me and I saw all these unfamiliar faces in the protests, and they were more brave than us -- I knew that this was it for the regime," Mr. Maher said.
It was then that they began to rely on advice from Tunisia, Serbia and the Academy of Change, which had sent staff members to Cairo a week before to train the protest organizers. After the police used tear gas to break up the protest that Tuesday, the organizers came back better prepared for their next march on Friday, the 28th, the "Day of Rage."
This time, they brought lemons, onions and vinegar to sniff for relief from the tear gas, and soda or milk to pour into their eyes. Some had fashioned cardboard or plastic bottles into makeshift armor worn under their clothes to protect against riot police bullets. They brought spray paint to cover the windshields of police cars, and they were ready to stuff the exhaust pipes and jam the wheels to render them useless. By the early afternoon, a few thousand protesters faced off against well over a thousand heavily armed riot police officers on the four-lane Kasr al-Nile Bridge in perhaps the most pivotal battle of the revolution.
"We pulled out all the tricks of the game -- the Pepsi, the onion, the vinegar," said Mr. Maher, who wore cardboard and plastic bottles under his sweater, a bike helmet on his head and a barrel-top shield on his arm. "The strategy was the people who were injured would go to the back and other people would replace them," he said. "We just kept rotating." After more than five hours of battle, they had finally won -- and burned down the empty headquarters of the ruling party on their way to occupy Tahrir Square.
Pressuring Mubarak
In Washington that day, President Obama turned up, unexpectedly, at a 3:30 p.m. Situation Room meeting of his "principals," the key members of the national security team, where he displaced Thomas E. Donilon, the national security adviser, from his seat at the head of the table.
The White House had been debating the likelihood of a domino effect since youth-driven revolts had toppled President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali in Tunisia, even though the American intelligence community and Israel's intelligence services had estimated that the risk to President Mubarak was low -- less than 20 percent, some officials said.
According to senior officials who participated in Mr. Obama's policy debates, the president took a different view. He made the point early on, a senior official said, that "this was a trend" that could spread to other authoritarian governments in the region, including in Iran. By the end of the 18-day uprising, by a White House count, there were 38 meetings with the president about Egypt. Mr. Obama said that this was a chance to create an alternative to "the Al Qaeda narrative" of Western interference.
American officials had seen no evidence of overtly anti-American or anti-Western sentiment. "When we saw people bringing their children to Tahrir Square, wanting to see history being made, we knew this was something different," one official said.
On Jan. 28, the debate quickly turned to how to pressure Mr. Mubarak in private and in public -- and whether Mr. Obama should appear on television urging change. Mr. Obama decided to call Mr. Mubarak, and several aides listened in on the line. Mr. Obama did not suggest that the 82-year-old leader step aside or transfer power. At this point, "the argument was that he really needed to do the reforms, and do them fast," a senior official said. Mr. Mubarak resisted, saying the protests were about outside interference.
According to the official, Mr. Obama told him, "You have a large portion of your people who are not satisfied, and they won't be until you make concrete political, social and economic reforms."
The next day, the decision was made to send former Ambassador Frank G. Wisner to Cairo as an envoy. Mr. Obama began placing calls to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and other regional leaders.
The most difficult calls, officials said, were with King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia and Mr. Netanyahu, who feared regional instability and urged the United States to stick with Mr. Mubarak. According to American officials, senior members of the government in Saudi Arabia argued that the United States should back Mr. Mubarak even if he used force against the demonstrators. By Feb. 1, when Mr. Mubarak broadcast a speech pledging that he would not run again and that elections would be held in September, Mr. Obama concluded that the Egyptian president still had not gotten the message.
Within an hour, Mr. Obama called Mr. Mubarak again in the toughest, and last, of their conversations. "He said if this transition process drags out for months, the protests will, too," one of Mr. Obama's aides said.
Mr. Mubarak told Mr. Obama that the protests would be over in a few days.
Mr. Obama ended the call, the official said, with these words: "I respect my elders. And you have been in politics for a very long time, Mr. President. But there are moments in history when just because things were the same way in the past doesn't mean they will be that way in the future."
The next day, heedless of Mr. Obama's admonitions, Mr. Mubarak launched another attack against the protesters, many of whom had by then spent five nights camped out in Tahrir Square. By about 2:30 p.m., thousands of burly men loyal to Mr. Mubarak and armed with rocks, clubs and, eventually, improvised explosives had come crashing into the square.
The protesters -- trying to stay true to the lessons they had learned from Gandhi, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Gene Sharp -- tried for a time to avoid retaliating. A row of men stood silent as rocks rained down on them. An older man told a younger one to put down his stick.
But by 3:30 p.m., the battle was joined. A rhythmic din of stones on metal rang out as the protesters beat street lamps and fences to rally their troops.
The Muslim Brotherhood, after sitting out the first day, had reversed itself, issuing an order for all able-bodied men to join the occupation of Tahrir Square. They now took the lead. As a secret, illegal organization, the Brotherhood was accustomed to operating in a disciplined hierarchy. The group's members helped the protesters divide into teams to organize their defense, several organizers said. One team broke the pavement into rocks, while another ferried the rocks to makeshift barricades along their perimeter and the third defended the front.
"The youth of the Muslim Brotherhood played a really big role," Mr. Maher said. "But actually so did the soccer fans" of Egypt's two leading teams. "These are always used to having confrontations with police at the stadiums," he said.
Soldiers of the Egyptian military, evidently under orders to stay neutral, stood watching from behind the iron gates of the Egyptian Museum as the war of stone missiles and improvised bombs continued for 14 hours until about four in the morning.
Then, unable to break the protesters' discipline or determination, the Mubarak forces resorted to guns, shooting 45 and killing 2, according to witnesses and doctors interviewed early that morning. The soldiers -- perhaps following orders to prevent excessive bloodshed, perhaps acting on their own -- finally intervened. They fired their machine guns into the ground and into the air, several witnesses said, scattering the Mubarak forces and leaving the protesters in unmolested control of the square, and by extension, the streets.
Once the military demonstrated it was unwilling to fire on its own citizens, the balance of power shifted. American officials urged the army to preserve its bond with the Egyptian people by sending top officers into the square to reassure the protesters, a step that further isolated Mr. Mubarak. But the Obama administration faltered in delivering its own message: Two days after the worst of the violence, Mr. Wisner publicly suggested that Mr. Mubarak had to be at the center of any change, and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton warned that any transition would take time. Other American officials suggested Mr. Mubarak might formally stay in office until his term ended next September. Then a four-day-long stalemate ensued, in which Mr. Mubarak refused to budge, and the protesters regained momentum.
On Thursday, Mr. Mubarak's vice president, Omar Suleiman, was on the phone with Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. at 2 p.m. in Washington, the third time they had spoken in a week. The airwaves were filled with rumors that Mr. Mubarak was stepping down, and Mr. Suleiman told Mr. Biden that he was preparing to assume Mr. Mubarak's powers. But as he spoke to Mr. Biden and other officials, Mr. Suleiman said that "certain powers" would remain with Mr. Mubarak, including the power to dissolve the Parliament and fire the cabinet. "The message from Suleiman was that he would be the de facto president," one person involved in the call said.
But while Mr. Mubarak huddled with his son Gamal, the Obama administration was in the dark about how events would unfold, reduced to watching cable television to see what Mr. Mubarak would decide. What they heard on Thursday night was a drastically rewritten speech, delivered in the unbowed tone of the father of the country, with scarcely any mention of a presumably temporary "delegation" of his power.
It was that rambling, convoluted address that proved the final straw for the Egyptian military, now fairly certain that it would have Washington's backing if it moved against Mr. Mubarak, American officials said. Mr. Mubarak's generals ramped up the pressure that led him at last, without further comment, to relinquish his power.
"Eighty-five million people live in Egypt, and less than 1,000 people died in this revolution -- most of them killed by the police," said Mr. Ghonim, the Google executive. "It shows how civilized the Egyptian people are." He added, "Now our nightmare is over. Now it is time to dream."
Correction: February 17, 2011, Thursday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Monday about the collaboration between young Tunisian and Egyptian activists that helped lead to the revolutions in their countries misspelled the name of a city in Egypt where a violent police crackdown in March 2008 proved to be an important event in the evolution of the Egyptian opposition movement. It is Mahalla, not Malhalla.

Abstract: While rising rates can be viewed as a positive sign -- they are a natural outgrowth of a recovering economy -- rates that climb too high and too fast could potentially slam the brakes on this rally, which has nearly doubled stock prices since March 2009. [...] accommodative monetary policies at home, combined with a tightening stance abroad, could renew global interest in the domestic stock market.

Full text: LAST year, the health of the global recovery was very much in doubt, and many investors worried about the possibility of a double-dip recession in the United States.
The climate has already changed radically. The economy has improved enough that many people are bracing for an entirely different threat: the risk that interest rates will soon rise too much to keep the stock market rally going.
At nearly 3.7 percent, the yield on 10-year Treasury securities is already nearly one and a half percentage points higher that is was in October. While rising rates can be viewed as a positive sign -- they are a natural outgrowth of a recovering economy -- rates that climb too high and too fast could potentially slam the brakes on this rally, which has nearly doubled stock prices since March 2009.
At the very least, the fear of rising rates is likely to alter the nature of this bull run. "Some effects are already being felt in the stock market," says Jeffrey N. Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL Financial in Boston.
Consider the stocks that performed best in 2010 -- and those that are doing well so far this year.
Last year, shares of risky but fast-growing small companies trounced big blue-chip stocks. That is typically what happens at the start of an economic recovery. But since the end of December, the Russell 2000 index of small stocks has risen 3.8 percent, versus a gain of 5.3 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500 index of large stocks.
One possible explanation, Mr. Kleintop says, is that small companies tend to rely more on debt to finance operations, while many giant corporations are flush with cash. So, in periods of rising rates, small companies are vulnerable to the threat of increased borrowing costs that can cut into profits.
Small stocks aren't the only ones that have slowed down. Sectors that are traditionally hurt by rising rates, like capital-intensive businesses that require substantial debt financing, are also lagging. The utility sector is an example: so far this year, the average mutual fund that invests in utility shares has returned a modest 3.1 percent, versus a 5 percent gain for the average domestic equity fund.
But industries that aren't as capital-intensive -- and therefore require less borrowing -- have been thriving. The technology sector, which has the least amount of debt of any segment of the S.& P. 500, has been the best-performing stock category of 2011. The average tech fund has returned more than 8 percent, according to Morningstar.
This change in market leadership is also playing out globally. Last year, when investors were yearning for growth, shares of companies based in fast-growing emerging markets like those of India and Latin America were among the world's best performers. In 2010, the average diversified emerging-market stock fund gained nearly 20 percent. Yet so far this year, it has lost more than 5 percent.
Why? Partly, it goes back to interest rates. Central banks in many emerging economies have already begun to raise short-term rates as they try to fight the threat of inflation overseas.
Just last week, the People's Bank of China raised a key lending rate by a quarter-point, in an effort to slow the economy and combat consumer prices that have been rising at an annual clip of more than 5 percent. It was China's third such rate increase in four months. Not surprisingly, Chinese equities are down 5 percent, on average, so far this year.
In the United States the situation is different. Fund managers in a Merrill Lynch survey said they thought the Federal Reserve wouldn't raise short-term rates until at least the first quarter of 2012.
That should give American stocks some room to run, several strategists say. In fact, accommodative monetary policies at home, combined with a tightening stance abroad, could renew global interest in the domestic stock market.
But even if the Fed keeps a lid on short rates, long-term rates have been rising. And the resulting jump in borrowing costs could, in theory, stave off any near-term recovery in the housing and labor markets.
Still, as long as the yield on 10-year Treasuries doesn't rise much above 5 percent, stocks are likely to thrive, says Jack A. Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank in Chicago. If yields on Treasuries climb much higher than that, some investors may be more tempted to hold them instead of stocks.
EVEN if the overall stock market keeps climbing, investors may want to be careful about the kinds of bets they make on stocks in this environment.
Tim Hayes, chief investment strategist at Ned Davis Research in Venice, Fla., notes that beyond utilities, other rate-sensitive sectors include telecommunications and financials. "They could be expected to underperform after rates start weighing down the market," he says.
Conversely, history shows that the least sensitive sectors of the economy include technology, materials and energy. All three are often beneficiaries of an improving economy.

Full text: WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- The United States trade deficit widened in December to its highest level in four months, the government said on Friday, and the annual trade gap expanded nearly 33 percent in 2010 as imports from China hit record levels.
The December trade deficit grew nearly 6 percent from the previous month, to $40.6 billion, higher than a consensus estimate of Wall Street analysts. The average price for imported oil rose to its highest level since October 2008.
Overall imports of goods and services were also their highest since October 2008, in a sign that consumers and businesses were spending more as the economy picked up steam.
Exports of goods and services were the highest since July 2008, the month they hit their peak before beginning a precipitous drop caused by the global financial crisis.
In another report, consumer sentiment rose to an eight-month high in early February, helped by recent tax cuts and optimism about the labor market, but consumers were still concerned about the economy in the longer term.
That report, the latest from Thomson Reuters and the University of Michigan, said that consumers expected improvement in the economy and job market this year, but that the recovery was still anticipated to fall short. It also found that worries about inflation and its effect on wages weighed on sentiment.
Consumer confidence was helped by the recent package of tax cuts and improved personal finances.
The preliminary February reading for the overall index on consumer sentiment came in at 75.1, up from 74.2 in January.
It was the highest level since June 2010 and was roughly in line with the median forecast of 75 expected by economists polled by Reuters.
In the report on the nation's trade balance, exports to China rose to a record $10.1 billion in December and were a record $91.9 billion for the year.
But record imports from China, of $364.9 billion for the entire year, pushed the closely watched trade gap with that country to a record $273.1 billion.
Rising oil prices also helped widen the trade deficit in 2010. The average price for imported oil jumped to $74.66 a barrel, from $56.93 in 2009.
Imports of consumer goods and foods, feeds and beverages also set records in 2010.
Over all, American imports of goods and services grew 19.7 percent in 2010, to $2.33 trillion.
Exports grew 16.6 percent, to $1.83 trillion, a pace that if maintained would allow the United States to reach President Obama's goal of doubling exports by 2013.
Exports of services, industrial supplies, consumer goods and petroleum all set records.
The strong services performance pushed the United States trade surplus for services to a record $148.7 billion in 2010.

Full text: CORRECTION APPENDED
BAMNOD, India -- The 50-year-old farmer knew from experience that his onion crop was doomed when torrential rains pounded his fields throughout September, a month when the Indian monsoon normally peters out.
For lack of modern agricultural systems in this part of rural India, his land does not have adequate drainage trenches, and he has no safe, dry place to store onions. The farmer, Arun Namder Talele, said he lost 70 percent of his onion crop on his five-acre farm here, about 70 miles north of the western city of Aurangabad.
"There are no limits to my losses," Mr. Talele said.
Mr. Talele's misfortune, and that of many other farmers here, is a grim reminder of a persistent fact: India, despite its ambitions as an emerging economic giant, still struggles to feed its 1.1 billion people.
Four decades after the Green Revolution seemed to be solving India's food problems, nearly half of Indian children age 5 or younger are malnourished. And soaring food prices, a problem around the world, are especially acute in India.
Globally, floods in Australia and drought in China have helped send food prices everywhere soaring -- on fears the world will see a repeat of shortages in 2007 and 2008 that caused food riots in some poor countries, including Egypt.
While India's agricultural problems are part of this bigger global puzzle, in many ways India's food challenges are more entrenched and systemic than those faced elsewhere.
Western investors may take eager note of India's economic growth rate of nearly 9 percent a year. But that statistic rings hollow in India's vast rural areas. Agriculture employs more than half the population, but it accounts for only 15 percent of the economy -- and it has grown an average of only about 3 percent in recent years.
Critics say Indian policy makers have failed to follow up on the country's investments in agricultural technology of the 1960s and '70s, as they focused on more glamorous, urban industries like information technology, financial services and construction.
There is no agribusiness of the type known in the United States, with highly mechanized farms growing thousands of acres of food crops, because Indian laws and customs bar corporations from farming land directly for food crops. The laws also make it difficult to assemble large land holdings.
Yet even as India's farming still depends on manual labor and the age-old vicissitudes of nature, demand for food has continued to rise -- because of a growing population and rising incomes, especially in the middle and upper classes. As a result, India is importing ever greater amounts of some staples like beans and lentils (up 157 percent from 2004 to 2009) and cooking oil (up 68 percent in the same period).
Food prices are rising faster in India than in almost any other major economy -- and faster than they did during the 2007-8 surge.
In December 2010, India's food prices jumped 13.7 from the year earlier, while inflation for all commodities, heavily weighted by the food number, stood at 8.4 percent.
A snapshot number released in mid-January showed Indian food prices rising even faster -- more than 17 percent over the same period in 2009 -- as the cost of onions, fruit, eggs, milk and other commodities rose.
Food inflation hits especially hard here because Indians -- most of whom live on less than $2 a day -- spend a bigger portion of their disposable incomes on food than people in other big, developing economies like China and Brazil.
"This is the worst form of taxation on the poorest of the poor," said Ashok Gulati, Asia director for the International Food Policy Research Institute.
Indian government officials have scrambled to make up the shortage of vegetables like onions by importing them. These short-term efforts have helped; onions are now available at 20 rupees a kilo (about 20 cents a pound) in Mumbai, down more than 70 percent from their recent highs.
But experts say the widening gap between agriculture's anemic supply and the rising demand for food calls for fundamental changes in farming policies.
During the Green Revolution the government invested heavily in rural agriculture, with an emphasis on hybrid seeds, fertilizers and irrigation canals.
More recent policy makers have not built on that early success. Most Indian farmers still do not have irrigation systems, and waste and inefficiency have severely depleted precious ground water.
Although many farmers have access to free or subsidized electricity that can be used to pump water, few receive power for more than a few hours a day. Mr. Talele, the farmer in Bamnod, gets only four hours of electricity during the day and four hours at night. During those periods he pumps well water that he then floods into his fields because he cannot afford the sprinklers or drip irrigation that would more efficiently and effectively water his crops.
And rural India has far too few temperature-controlled warehouses that could help farmers and the nation build up reserves as a hedge against poor growing seasons.
When Mr. Talele's vegetables are ready for harvest he immediately takes them to wholesale markets, which are controlled by committees of local traders. "Whatever the market decides, that's the price we get," he said.
Indian officials acknowledge that the country needs to increase investment in irrigation, encourage competition in wholesale and retail markets, and provide targeted food subsidies to the poor. And they also have to provide more education and jobs to villagers, so fewer people are forced to live off the land.
Experts say India needs to make changes like some of the ones China made, beginning in the late 1970s, when it started investing heavily in agriculture and eased regulations on farming.
As recently as 1977, Chinese and Indian farmers harvested roughly the same amount of wheat for each acre that they planted. But by 2009, United Nations data shows that wheat yields were 1.7 times higher in China than in India.
Kaushik Basu, a Cornell University professor who is also the chief economic adviser to India's finance minister, says he now sees more willingness by Indian officials to reform agriculture policies.
But outside experts like Mr. Gulati are skeptical that real change will come from the government. The ruling coalition has been hobbled by corruption scandals, and an energized opposition last year effectively blocked proceedings in Parliament.
Some Indian farmers are investing on their own, finding ways to circumvent the government when necessary and using subsidies when they are available.
About 10 miles from Mr. Talele's farm in the village of Pahur, Sandeep Ram Karshanbakr's farming income has jumped to 200,000 rupees ($4,400) a year, from 80,000 rupees ($1,800) three years ago. He credits the improvement to a drip irrigation system he bought from an Indian company, Jain Irrigation.
The government paid half the 128,000 rupees ($2,800) cost of the system. That has cut the amount of water and electricity Mr. Karshanbakr uses by about half on his three acres, while improving yields twofold to fivefold on his crops of chilis, cauliflower, eggplants, tomatoes and cotton.
Mr. Karshanbakr says he is now considering buying or leasing more land. But many farmers, like Mr. Talele, say they simply cannot afford such irrigation equipment -- even with government subsidies as high as 50 percent of the sticker price. "It's still too expensive," he said.
Anil Jain, managing director at Jain Irrigation, said India needs to help farmers like Mr. Talele invest. "Agriculture can grow at 6 to 8 percent," he said. "But we have to create opportunity and income in rural areas."

Correction: February 16, 2011, Wednesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A picture caption on Saturday with an article about the failure of India's agricultural systems to keep pace with its economic and population growth referred incompletely to the harvest that was shown. While the field did contain coriander, the plants shown in the foreground were another leaf vegetable -- not coriander, which was planted between the rows and not visible. (A plant being tossed in the air by a worker was coriander.)

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Kevin M. Warsh, who was the Federal Reserve's chief liaison to Wall Street, will resign from the central bank's board at the end of March, giving President Obama yet another chance to leave his stamp on the Fed.
In an unusual move, Mr. Warsh, 40, had publicly expressed skepticism about the Fed's $600 billion plan, begun in November, to buy bonds to lower long-term interest rates and stimulate bank lending.
He was the only one of the Fed governors, who are presidentially appointed, to voice such doubts, though he never voted against the plan. A former aide to President George W. Bush, he was the only governor with close ties to Republicans in Congress and to conservative organizations, like the Hoover Institution.
With his departure, the Fed board loses that link to conservatives at a time when conservative economists and some Republicans on Capitol Hill are sharply critical of the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, and his policies.
The central bank looks to be increasingly dominated by so-called doves, who emphasize policies intended to create jobs and economic growth equally with fighting inflation, rather than those known as hawks, for whom stable prices and low inflation are paramount.
"It seems likely that anyone nominated by President Obama will be more 'dovish' than Kevin Warsh right now," on inflation, said Alan S. Blinder, a Princeton economist and former Fed vice chairman.
The Fed's seven-member board already overwhelmingly bears Mr. Obama's mark. He named Mr. Bernanke to a second four-year term that began last year and has installed three other governors: Daniel K. Tarullo and Sarah Bloom Raskin, who specialize in bank regulation, and the economist Janet L. Yellen, the Fed's vice chairwoman.
Another Obama nominee, the economist and Nobel laureate Peter A. Diamond, is awaiting Senate confirmation to the only vacancy on the board.
Mr. Warsh, a former specialist in mergers and acquisitions at Morgan Stanley, helped manage the Fed's response to the 2008 financial crisis, playing a crucial role in the decisions to broker the sale of Bear Stearns to JPMorgan Chase, to allow Lehman Brothers to go bankrupt and to bail out the American International Group. He joined the Fed board five years ago, after serving in the White House.
Mark W. Olson, a former Fed governor who overlapped with Mr. Warsh for several months in 2006, said Mr. Warsh's departure would leave a gap. "One thing the Fed needs to understand is the perspective of Wall Street, and Kevin brought that in a way that nobody else did at that point," he said. "Kevin's real value was to help us understand what the capital markets thought and how they were responding to the decisions we made."
Mr. Olson said "it will be incumbent on the Fed board to reach out" to conservatives, just as it tries to reflect the perspectives of consumers and not just bankers.
The Fed board has been fairly unified on monetary policy lately. With unemployment at 9 percent and inflation below the Fed's unofficial target of around 2 percent, Mr. Bernanke has expressed confidence that the Fed's extraordinarily easy monetary policy is justified. But some conservatives say that Mr. Bernanke might be setting the stage for future inflation and asset bubbles. Mr. Warsh served at times as a liaison between Mr. Bernanke and those conservative critics.
In a statement, Mr. Bernanke praised Mr. Warsh for "exemplary service" and "intimate knowledge of financial markets and institutions." He added: "I deeply appreciate his insights and wise counsel, and most especially, his fortitude and friendship during the difficult days, nights and weekends of the crisis."
But Mr. Warsh has at times tried to keep his distance from Mr. Bernanke. Five days after the Fed's policy-marking arm voted on Nov. 3 to buy $600 billion in Treasury securities -- the second round of a strategy known as quantitative easing that is intended to lower long-term interest rates -- The Wall Street Journal published an article by Mr. Warsh expressing doubt.
Though Mr. Warsh voted for the bond-buying plan -- by Fed tradition, board members almost never vote against the chairman -- he said he viewed the strategy as "necessarily limited, circumscribed and subject to regular review." He added, "Policies should be altered if certain objectives are satisfied, purported benefits disappoint or potential risks threaten to materialize."
The piece was seen in some quarters as presaging his departure.
Officials said Mr. Warsh, a lawyer, would return to New York, where his wife, Jane Lauder, lives, and work in the private sector. He declined to comment on Thursday.
Randall S. Kroszner, who served with Mr. Warsh on the board, remarked on the significant shift in economic conditions since they started together.
"When Kevin and I had our confirmation hearing together, almost exactly five years ago, Valentine's Day 2006, neither of us could have envisaged the historic challenges the Fed was soon to face," said Mr. Kroszner, an economist at the University of Chicago business school. "The crucial issue at the time was to rein in inflation, but a key challenge of the crisis a couple of years later was to prevent a Japan-style collapse and deflation."

Abstract: In an attempt to create a gotcha moment, he waved a copy of a newspaper bearing the headline "Inflation Worries Spread" at the Fed chairman. [...] even Milton Friedman saw the conduct of monetary policy as a technical issue, not a matter of principle; his complaint about the Fed's role in the Great Depression was that it didn't print enough money, not that it printed too much.

Full text: There was a time when Republicans used to refer to themselves, proudly, as "the party of Lincoln." But you don't hear that line much these days. Why?
The main answer, presumably, lies in the G.O.P.'s decision, long ago, to seek votes from Southerners angered by the end of legal segregation. With the old Confederacy now the heart of the Republican base, boasting about the party's Civil War-era legacy is no longer advisable.
But sooner or later, Republicans were bound to notice other reasons to disavow Lincoln. He was, after all, the first president to institute an income tax. And he was also the first president to issue a paper currency -- the "greenback" -- that wasn't backed by gold or silver. "There is nothing more insidious that a country can do to its people than to debase its currency," declared Representative Paul Ryan in one of two hearings Congress held on Wednesday on monetary policy. So much, then, for the Great Liberator.
Which brings me to the story of what went on in those monetary hearings.
One of the hearings was called by Representative Ron Paul, a harsh critic of the Federal Reserve, who now has an oversight role over the very institution he wants abolished in favor of a return to the gold standard. Mr. Paul's subcommittee called three witnesses, one of whom was an odd choice: Thomas DiLorenzo, a professor at Loyola University and a senior fellow at the Ludwig von Mises Institute.
What was odd about that choice? Well, Mr. DiLorenzo hasn't actually written much about monetary policy, although he has described Fed policy -- not just recently, but since the 1960s -- as "legalized counterfeiting operations." His main claim to fame, instead, is as a critic of Lincoln -- he's the author of "Lincoln Unmasked: What You're Not Supposed to Know About Dishonest Abe" -- and as a modern-day secessionist.
No, really: calls for secession run through many of Mr. DiLorenzo's writings -- for example, in his declaration that "healthcare freedom" won't be restored until "some states begin seceding from the new American fascialistic state." Raise the rebel flag!
O.K., it's going to be a while before the G.O.P. as a whole embraces neo-secessionism, and Mr. Paul, although highly visible, is, in fact, a somewhat marginal figure even within his own party. But Mr. Ryan, who led the other hearing -- the one at which Ben Bernanke, the Fed chairman, testified -- is a rising Republican star. So it's worth noting that Mr. Ryan's hard-money rhetoric was nearly as bizarre as Mr. DiLorenzo's.
Start with that bit about debasing our currency. Where did that come from? The dollar's value in terms of other major currencies is about the same now as it was three years ago. And as Mr. Bernanke pointed out, consumer prices rose only 1.2 percent in 2010, an inflation rate that, for the record, is well below the rate under the sainted Ronald Reagan. The Fed's preferred measure, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, was up only 0.7 percent, well below the target of around 2 percent.
But Mr. Ryan is sure that the dollar is being debased and won't take no for an answer. In an attempt to create a gotcha moment, he waved a copy of a newspaper bearing the headline "Inflation Worries Spread" at the Fed chairman. But the gotcha actually went the other way. As Mr. Bernanke immediately pointed out, the article was about inflation in China and other emerging markets, not in the United States. And the Fed chairman declared, correctly, that "inflation made here in the U.S. is very, very low."
Advantage Bernanke. But the facts don't matter, because conservative hard-money mania, the demand that the Fed stop trying to rescue the economy, isn't really about inflation fears.
Mr. Ryan said as much in Wednesday's hearing, in which he declared that our currency "should be guided by the rule of law, not the rule of men." A few years ago, my response would have been, say what? After all, even Milton Friedman saw the conduct of monetary policy as a technical issue, not a matter of principle; his complaint about the Fed's role in the Great Depression was that it didn't print enough money, not that it printed too much.
But then Friedman, who believed that it sometimes makes sense to let your currency depreciate, who urged Japan's central bank to adopt a policy very similar to what the Fed is doing now, was a leftist by the standards of today's G.O.P.
Wednesday's hearings aren't likely to have any immediate effect on monetary policy. But they offer a revealing -- and appalling -- look at the mind-set of one of our two major political parties. We've always known that the modern G.O.P. wants to take America back to the way it was before the New Deal; but now it's clear that the party wants to build a bridge to the 19th century, and maybe even to the antebellum era. Backward, march!

Full text: Loans with fewer restrictions on them may not be so dangerous after all. So says Tony James, president of the Blackstone Group, the private equity firm. And the numbers suggest he could be partly right. So-called covenant-lite loans are borrower-friendly but have been considered risky for lenders. As it turns out, they perform no worse, or a bit better, than debt with covenants.
More than 25 percent of first-lien loans issued in 2011 have covenant-lite structures, a higher percentage than for all 2007, according to Standard & Poor's Leveraged Commentary and Data. The recently announced $5.3 billion buyout of Del Monte, for instance, came with a $2.7 billion covenant-lite loan package that investors snapped up.
Bank loans traditionally come with a requirement that a borrower does not exceed a certain level of debt. If it breaches the limit, creditors get a chance to negotiate what happens next, like higher interest or even a restructuring. Covenant-lite loans remove that protection.
In theory, that could allow a company to borrow more and more, with earlier lenders helpless. In practice, though, covenant-lites have done O.K. They returned a total of 33 percent in the five years through January compared with 31 percent for covenant-heavy loans, according to Leveraged Commentary and Data.
One reason is that lenders generally give up covenants only for stronger-looking borrowers, even within a rating category. Another is that the flexibility of covenant-lite loans helps long-term healthy borrowers get past short-term difficulties without defaulting.
Further, it may be that covenants often do not bring much protection anyway. Because they typically cap debt at a level 20 to 30 percent above a company's initial debt load, a highly leveraged borrower could easily run out of cash long before breaching a debt covenant.
Investors are still rightly taking care. Del Monte's debt of seven times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization is high, but it is not outrageous for a leveraged buyout, especially with Ebitda growing 36 percent in 2010. Lenders shouldn't get carried away, though. Covenants may not always seem worth much, but if investors let them go completely, they may come to miss them.
The Next Volcker
Kevin Warsh's resignation as a governor of the Federal Reserve removes one of the closest advisers to the chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, and almost certainly the most hawkish of his inner circle. If current policies produce 1970s-style inflation, as many of Mr. Bernanke's critics predict, Mr. Warsh could be well placed to take over as Paul A. Volcker did in 1979.
While Mr. Warsh voted with his boss on monetary policy matters, as is Fed tradition, the former investment banker has made clear his concerns over recent financial policy, writing in November that "chronic short-termism in the conduct of economic policy has done much to bring us to this parlous point."
Mr. Warsh, a Republican who is both a fiscal hawk and a proponent of higher savings rates, has said he believes "sound fiscal policy must do more than reacquaint consumers with old bad habits." He also has said that "responsible monetary policy" in the current climate should heed potential long-term effects.
So his imminent departure would appear to deprive Mr. Bernanke of an intellectual sparring partner, strengthening the hand of the doves on the Fed board. However, assuming he does not depart the monetary policy arena to run for political office or return to Wall Street, he represents a kind of secret weapon for monetary hawks should current policies produce resurgent inflation and its attendant woes.
Outside the Fed, Mr. Warsh will be better placed to make the case for monetary stringency than while belonging to the collegial Board of Governors. In extremis, should a spike in inflation or a financial market crash remove the credibility of current Fed policies, Mr. Warsh would be available as a replacement, either when Mr. Bernanke's current term ends in January 2014 or earlier in a crisis.
That's sort of what happened when Mr. Volcker was appointed Fed chairman to replace G. William Miller, who had lost the faith of bond markets. As a known Republican, Mr. Warsh would presumably be passed over by President Obama. But at 40, he is a relative spring chicken compared with Mr. Volcker, 83. Harder money advocates who felt they lacked a potential replacement for Mr. Bernanke may find succor in Mr. Warsh's decision.

Full text: CORRECTION APPENDED
IS there a way to invest in inflation-tracking vehicles that also benefit from growth in emerging markets?
Commodities are often the answer, although not in the way most investors see them. Rather than latching onto the metals upsurge or even more fickle agricultural products, investors can find funds that offer a diverse basket of commodities. They can be essential parts of any wealth-building portfolio.
In most years commodities show an inverse correlation to American stocks and the dollar and provide another layer of diversification for a portfolio. A weak or declining buck is one factor that has pushed dollar-denominated commodities prices higher.
Commodities, viewed separately, are extraordinarily volatile. Subject to supply and demand and the vagaries of futures exchanges, they are among the riskiest short-term investments. Trading them is best left to professionals.
Yet what about the direct connection between commodities and inflation? And what about the increase in demand because of the growth in emerging economies like China and India? Don't these developing countries need all of the copper, coal and agricultural goods they can get?
"As more and more people in formerly poor nations are entering the global middle class," wrote Paul Krugman, the Nobel Prize-winning economist, in his Op-Ed column in The New York Times on Dec. 27, "They're beginning to drive cars and eat meat, placing growing pressure on world oil and food supplies. And those supplies aren't keeping pace."
One prominent commodities advocate -- Jim Rogers, chairman of Rogers Holdings -- has been bullish on commodities since 1999. Like many international investors, he has seen demand escalate from emerging economies and does not expect that trend to ease -- particularly with the potential for rising inflation.
"Prices for raw materials are rising again," Mr. Rogers told a meeting of the Executives' Club in Chicago on Jan. 13, "which will just stoke the inflationary pressures caused by money printing."
Although commodities prices swooned in 2008 during the global financial collapse -- along with just about every other asset class except for United States Treasury bonds -- they have rebounded smartly in recent years.
The Continuous Commodity Index, a benchmark maintained by the Commodity Research Bureau, was up 33 percent in 2009. That was a sharp contrast to 2008, when world demand plummeted and the index was off 48 percent. Last year, commodities prices gained about 17 percent over all, according to the Dow Jones-UBS Commodity Index. Until three years ago, commodities were on an uninterrupted bull run that began in 2001. The index peaked in 2008, having risen to a post-World War II record, posting a gain of 236 percent over the seven years. One surprise in the 2009 commodities rebound was the sectors that led the rally -- not gold, silver or platinum. The leaders were cotton and copper, up 96 percent; cocoa, coffee and orange juice, up 63 percent; and crude/heating oil and natural gas, up 58 percent.
While gold was up about 43 percent last year, it may not lead in 2011, with energy prices rising and the possibility of a gold bubble.
To get an idea of how volatile commodity prices are, you need only look at the worst category last year, natural gas, which was down 41 percent. Normally, such price swings do not occur in bonds. There are too many market forces to contend with, so why take the risk of guessing wrong on the commodity that's overbought?
There are hundreds of ways to bet on commodity prices; almost all of them are ill advised for investors managing their own portfolios. You can buy individual futures contracts on commodities as different as gold and pork bellies.
Or there's the ever-expanding field of exchange-traded funds. Let's say you wanted to bet on rare earth metals, which are essential in most high-tech products. You might explore a fund like the Market Vectors Rare Earth/Strategic Metals E.T.F. (REMX), which has nearly half of its holdings in mines in Australia, Canada and the United States.
For most investors, though, it's wiser to spread your money among a wide array of commodities and leave the management to professionals. Several broad-based funds offer lower-risk alternatives.
One such fund is the PowerShares DB Commodity Index Tracking Fund E.T.F. (DBC), which is based on the Deutsche Bank Liquid Commodity Index. The fund tracks commodities like oil, gasoline, natural gas, gold, aluminum, silver, copper, corn, wheat, soybeans and sugar. The iShares S.& P. GSCI Commodity-Indexed Trust E.T.F. (GSG) is another, and is heavily weighted toward energy.
Jeff Layman, who co-manages $1.7 billion for BKD Wealth Advisors in Springfield, Mo., favors the Pimco Commodity Real Return Strategy D fund (PCRDX), which mixes commodities with Treasury inflation-protected securities. (Disclosure: This fund is in my retirement portfolio.) Not only does he use the fund as a hedge against inflation, it is a play on growth in emerging economies and possible declines in the value of the dollar against foreign currencies.
"Although commodities are extremely volatile, I think inflation is coming back," Mr. Layman said. "I expect commodities prices will be higher 10 years from now, and there's an expectation of a weakening dollar." Mr. Layman allocates no more than 5 percent to commodities in his clients' portfolios.
As with any funds, there are robust debates about the best E.T.F. (and underlying commodity index) to choose, yet few will argue the need to protect against a falling dollar, rising inflation and the potential for another downturn in American stocks. Commodity funds are not a perfect hedge for any of these events. But their clear link to growth in developing nations is a bonus worth pursuing.
Correction: February 11, 2011, Friday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article in the special Wealth section on Thursday about investing in commodities misstated the name of the business entity in Springfield, Mo., for which Jeff Layman co-manages $1.7 billion. It is BKD Wealth Advisors (a subsidiary of BKD, a financial services company), not BKD Investments.

Abstract: Under the plan, which is subject to Congressional approval, there would be a two-year moratorium on the increased taxes that employers would otherwise have to pay to support the unemployment insurance system, which could save businesses as much as $7 billion.

Full text: So many people now receive jobless benefits that 30 states have run out of their unemployment trust funds and are borrowing $42 billion from the federal government. Three of the hardest-hit states -- Michigan, Indiana and South Carolina -- have borrowed so much that they triggered automatic unemployment tax increases on employers, and the same thing is likely to happen to 20 more states this year.
The crisis could prove to be a point of friction between Republican governors and members of Congress. On Tuesday, the Obama administration unveiled a smart proposal to delay those tax increases and provide some relief to both employers and state governments. Congressional Republicans reflexively objected to the idea, which could produce higher taxes in three years, but this plan provides relief that might stimulate hiring now when it is most needed. Republican governors in desperate states like Michigan and Indiana are likely to find that more attractive than party members in Washington do.
Under the plan, which is subject to Congressional approval, there would be a two-year moratorium on the increased taxes that employers would otherwise have to pay to support the unemployment insurance system, which could save businesses as much as $7 billion. During those same two years, states would be forgiven from paying the $1.3 billion in interest they owe Washington on the money they have borrowed. The stimulus bill provided a grace period, but it expired last year.
In 2014, when the economy will presumably have recovered somewhat, employers will have to make up for the moratorium by paying higher unemployment taxes to the states. Specifically, they will have to pay taxes on the first $15,000 of an employee's income, instead of the current $7,000. But, even then, unemployment taxes will be at the same level, adjusted for inflation, as they were in 1983, when President Ronald Reagan raised them.
The administration is proposing to cut the federal unemployment tax rate in 2014 so that employers would pay the same amount to Washington as they do now. States, if they choose to do so, could collect more from each employer to repay the federal government and restock their own unemployment trust funds.
Republicans immediately derided the proposal as an irresponsible tax increase. On his blog, Representative Eric Cantor, the House majority leader, criticized the higher taxes in 2014, but he did not mention the two-year moratorium on the automatic tax increases in 20 vulnerable states.
The proposal is not a bailout for the states or employers but rather a recognition that the automatic tax increases built into the benefits system could put a brake on hiring -- and in precisely the states where employers need the most incentive to bring people back to work.
Over the next decade, as more people return to work and the states repay their debt more quickly, the proposal is expected to bring more dollars back to the federal government than the temporary moratorium will cost, so the long-term effect on the deficit should be positive. The full details of the plan's costs and benefits will be available when President Obama submits his 2012 budget to Congress next week. When he does, both parties should take a close look at the numbers and seize the opportunity to keep this fundamental safety net solvent.

In First Talk to Republican-Led House, Bernanke Defends Fed Policies

Abstract: Though Mr. Bernanke did not take sides on the most volatile questions of fiscal policy -- whether to cut military spending, change entitlement programs like Medicare and raise personal income tax rates -- he did offer lawmakers some suggestions.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, parried tough questions Wednesday about rising gasoline prices in the United States and the soaring cost of food and grains in the emerging world as he defended the central bank's $600 billion program to shore up the recovery.
Mr. Bernanke said it was "certainly possible" that the Fed might cut short its efforts to loosen credit by buying Treasury bonds, especially if domestic inflation were to flare. But Mr. Bernanke maintained that for now, inflation was comfortably in check despite rising commodity prices overseas.
In his first appearance before House lawmakers since Republicans took control of the chamber last month, they repeatedly tried to draw him into the fierce debate over a looming vote to raise the government's $14.3 trillion borrowing limit.
But the Fed chairman repeatedly declined to side with one party or the other on what was needed to plug the budget deficit. "Congress is going to have to decide where its values are, whether it wants to raise taxes, whether it wants to cut spending or whether it wants some combination," Mr. Bernanke said.
The chairman reiterated his view that toying with the debt ceiling -- some Republicans want to use the vote to force the Obama administration to make immediate spending cuts -- could be disastrous if it resulted in a time-consuming debate that worried debt markets and forced the Treasury to default.
Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the new chairman of the House Budget Committee and a vocal skeptic of the Fed's bond-buying effort, told Mr. Bernanke: "My concern is that the costs of the Fed's current monetary policy -- the money creation and massive balance sheet expansion -- will come to outweigh the perceived short-term benefits."
Mr. Ryan described "a sharp rise in a variety of key global commodity and basic material prices," and an increase in interest rates of longer-term Treasury securities. And while conceding that American consumers were not yet experiencing substantially higher prices, Mr. Ryan warned that "the inflation dynamic can be quick to materialize and painful to eradicate once it takes hold."
Mr. Ryan all but accused Mr. Bernanke of devaluing the dollar, saying, "There is nothing more insidious that a country can do to its citizens than debase its currency."
Mr. Bernanke said the rise in commodity prices was mostly "a result of the very strong demand from fast-growing emerging market economies, coupled, in some cases, with constraints on supply." He did not mention China by name, but he has in the past.
He added that overall inflation was "still quite low" and that longer-term inflation expectations, which can influence short-term changes in prices, were stable.
In 2010, a closely watched measure of inflation, the price index for personal consumption expenditures, rose by 1.2 percent, compared with 2.4 percent in 2009. And core inflation, which excludes the food and energy prices, was 0.7 percent in 2010, compared with around 2.5 percent in 2007. Wages rose only 1.7 percent last year.
Mr. Bernanke also denied printing money to finance government borrowing, saying, "What we're doing here is a temporary measure that will be reversed." Eventually, the Fed sells the bonds it acquires.
While part of the historically large deficits of the last two years stem from the government's responses to the recession, Mr. Bernanke said the budget would remain on an unsustainable path even as the economy improved because of an aging population and rising health care costs.
Though Mr. Bernanke did not take sides on the most volatile questions of fiscal policy -- whether to cut military spending, change entitlement programs like Medicare and raise personal income tax rates -- he did offer lawmakers some suggestions.
He told Representative Betty McCollum, a Minnesota Democrat, that Congress should close myriad corporate tax loopholes and then lower the corporate tax rate. He told Representative Mike Honda, a California Democrat, that wise investments in education, including community colleges and on-the-job training, were essential to lowering unemployment.
The chairman also offered some of his most detailed comments to date on what he called China's "counterproductive policy" of undervaluing its currency, the renminbi.
"They have an inflation problem, and the way they're addressing it is not by raising their currency value, which would reduce the demand for their exports," he told Representative Tim Ryan, an Ohio Democrat. "Rather, they are leaving it where it is, and they are instead trying to reduce domestic demand through higher interest rates. And it would seem like a better strategy would be to let domestic demand be what it is and let people enjoy a higher standard of living in China, and reduce their exports via a higher exchange rate."
On Tuesday, China raised interest rates for the third time since October, and many economists in Asia expect that China will do so again this year.
Mr. Bernanke said the Fed was prepared to start raising interest rates when the time came. "Just like a quarterback has to lead a receiver," he told Representative James Lankford, an Oklahoma Republican, the Fed has to begin tightening monetary policy before inflation becomes a problem.
But Representative Todd Rokita, Republican of Indiana, said the Fed had a poor track record in that regard. "Can you name one time in your agency's history where you got it right, where you got on the brakes in time to correct runaway inflation?" he asked.
Mr. Bernanke pointed to his predecessor Paul A. Volcker, who crushed inflation in the early 1980s by sharply raising interest rates. But Mr. Rokita said the Fed had not acted in time.
As Mr. Bernanke spoke, Representative Ron Paul, a Texas Republican, held his own hearing to lambast the Fed.
"There is a great recovery going on," said Mr. Paul, who has advocated abolishing the Fed and now leads a Financial Services subcommittee that oversees the Fed. "But the people don't feel that way."
The Fed did not take part in the hearing, at which three experts testified.

Full text: CORRECTION APPENDED
IS there a way to invest in inflation-tracking vehicles that also benefit from growth in emerging markets?
Commodities are often the answer, although not in the way most investors see them. Rather than latching onto the metals upsurge or even more fickle agricultural products, investors can find funds that offer a diverse basket of commodities. They can be essential parts of any wealth-building portfolio.
In most years commodities show an inverse correlation to American stocks and the dollar and provide another layer of diversification for a portfolio. A weak or declining buck is one factor that has pushed dollar-denominated commodities prices higher.
Commodities, viewed separately, are extraordinarily volatile. Subject to supply and demand and the vagaries of futures exchanges, they are among the riskiest short-term investments. Trading them is best left to professionals.
Yet what about the direct connection between commodities and inflation? And what about the increase in demand because of the growth in emerging economies like China and India? Don't these developing countries need all of the copper, coal and agricultural goods they can get?
"As more and more people in formerly poor nations are entering the global middle class," wrote Paul Krugman, the Nobel Prize-winning economist, in his Op-Ed column in The New York Times on Dec. 27, "They're beginning to drive cars and eat meat, placing growing pressure on world oil and food supplies. And those supplies aren't keeping pace."
One prominent commodities advocate -- Jim Rogers, chairman of Rogers Holdings -- has been bullish on commodities since 1999. Like many international investors, he has seen demand escalate from emerging economies and does not expect that trend to ease -- particularly with the potential for rising inflation.
"Prices for raw materials are rising again," Mr. Rogers told a meeting of the Executives' Club in Chicago on Jan. 13, "which will just stoke the inflationary pressures caused by money printing."
Although commodities prices swooned in 2008 during the global financial collapse -- along with just about every other asset class except for United States Treasury bonds -- they have rebounded smartly in recent years.
The Continuous Commodity Index, a benchmark maintained by the Commodity Research Bureau, was up 33 percent in 2009. That was a sharp contrast to 2008, when world demand plummeted and the index was off 48 percent. Last year, commodities prices gained about 17 percent over all, according to the Dow Jones-UBS Commodity Index. Until three years ago, commodities were on an uninterrupted bull run that began in 2001. The index peaked in 2008, having risen to a post-World War II record, posting a gain of 236 percent over the seven years. One surprise in the 2009 commodities rebound was the sectors that led the rally -- not gold, silver or platinum. The leaders were cotton and copper, up 96 percent; cocoa, coffee and orange juice, up 63 percent; and crude/heating oil and natural gas, up 58 percent.
While gold was up about 43 percent last year, it may not lead in 2011, with energy prices rising and the possibility of a gold bubble.
To get an idea of how volatile commodity prices are, you need only look at the worst category last year, natural gas, which was down 41 percent. Normally, such price swings do not occur in bonds. There are too many market forces to contend with, so why take the risk of guessing wrong on the commodity that's overbought?
There are hundreds of ways to bet on commodity prices; almost all of them are ill advised for investors managing their own portfolios. You can buy individual futures contracts on commodities as different as gold and pork bellies.
Or there's the ever-expanding field of exchange-traded funds. Let's say you wanted to bet on rare earth metals, which are essential in most high-tech products. You might explore a fund like the Market Vectors Rare Earth/Strategic Metals E.T.F. (REMX), which has nearly half of its holdings in mines in Australia, Canada and the United States.
For most investors, though, it's wiser to spread your money among a wide array of commodities and leave the management to professionals. Several broad-based funds offer lower-risk alternatives.
One such fund is the PowerShares DB Commodity Index Tracking Fund E.T.F. (DBC), which is based on the Deutsche Bank Liquid Commodity Index. The fund tracks commodities like oil, gasoline, natural gas, gold, aluminum, silver, copper, corn, wheat, soybeans and sugar. The iShares S.& P. GSCI Commodity-Indexed Trust E.T.F. (GSG) is another, and is heavily weighted toward energy.
Jeff Layman, who co-manages $1.7 billion for BKD Wealth Advisors in Springfield, Mo., favors the Pimco Commodity Real Return Strategy D fund (PCRDX), which mixes commodities with Treasury inflation-protected securities. (Disclosure: This fund is in my retirement portfolio.) Not only does he use the fund as a hedge against inflation, it is a play on growth in emerging economies and possible declines in the value of the dollar against foreign currencies.
"Although commodities are extremely volatile, I think inflation is coming back," Mr. Layman said. "I expect commodities prices will be higher 10 years from now, and there's an expectation of a weakening dollar." Mr. Layman allocates no more than 5 percent to commodities in his clients' portfolios.
As with any funds, there are robust debates about the best E.T.F. (and underlying commodity index) to choose, yet few will argue the need to protect against a falling dollar, rising inflation and the potential for another downturn in American stocks. Commodity funds are not a perfect hedge for any of these events. But their clear link to growth in developing nations is a bonus worth pursuing.

Correction: February 11, 2011, Friday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article in the special Wealth section on Thursday about investing in commodities misstated the name of the business entity in Springfield, Mo., for which Jeff Layman co-manages $1.7 billion. It is BKD Wealth Advisors (a subsidiary of BKD, a financial services company), not BKD Investments.

Full text: HONG KONG -- China on Tuesday raised interest rates for the third time since October, in the latest sign that the authorities were trying to temper economic growth and prevent inflation from escalating further.
The central bank in Beijing raised its benchmark one-year deposit rate by a quarter of a percentage point, to 3 percent, and its one-year lending rate by a similar amount, to 6.06 percent.
The timing of the announcement, at the very end of the Lunar New Year holiday, which has kept mainland Chinese markets closed for the last week, was in line with what many analysts had expected.
In fact, many economists forecast still more increases and other measures this year as the battle to combat price increases intensifies. "There are plenty of reasons to expect inflation to pick up further in the next few months," Brian Jackson, an analyst at the Royal Bank of Canada in Hong Kong, wrote in a note after the rate increase announcement Tuesday.
"Gradual policy rate increases in the months ahead should help to slow down investment in parts of the economy at risk of overheating, while also reducing the risk that more aggressive and disruptive action may be required at a later stage," he wrote.
Buoyed by ample lending and extensive state investment projects, the Chinese economy powered ahead last year, overtaking that of Japan to become the world's second-largest economy after the United States.
Data released by the National Bureau of Statistics on Jan. 20 put the pace of growth at 10.3 percent for 2010, up from 9.2 percent in 2009 and significantly above what analysts had expected. Inflation came in at 4.6 percent for December, well above what the authorities are comfortable with, and could rise further, economists believe.
As in many other emerging economies, rapid growth has combined with easy credit and inflows of cash from overseas to push up asset and consumer prices this year.
Beijing has reacted with a range of tools aimed at containing price increases. These have included measures aimed specifically at the hot real estate sector -- like property taxes recently announced for some cities -- and instructions to the country's state-controlled banks to lend less.
The reserve requirement ratio for state-controlled banks -- which effectively dictates the amount that lenders have to set aside against loans, and thus affects how much they can lend -- has been raised seven times since early 2010.
Currency appreciation will also most likely be part of Beijing's efforts to curb inflation over 2011, said Mr. Jackson, the R.B.C. economist.
The pace of any such increases, however, is likely to remain muted, analysts and bankers with knowledge of policy makers' views have said. The renminbi has already been rising at an annualized rate of 5.7 percent against the dollar since China broke the currency's peg to the dollar last June.

Shares Post Gains After China Raises Interest Rates

Full text: The Dow Jones industrial average closed higher for the seventh consecutive day on Tuesday in the longest series of gains for the index since July.
McDonald's was the biggest gainer of the stocks in the Dow, rising 2.6 percent after reporting January sales that were higher than analysts had expected.
Investors took in stride a move by China's central bank to control inflation by raising short-term interest rates.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 71.52 points, or 0.59 percent, to close at 12,233.15. The index has had only one down day in the last 10, on Jan. 28, when the protests in Egypt escalated.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 5.52 points, or 0.42 percent, to 1,324.57. The Nasdaq composite index rose 13.06 points, or 0.47 percent, to 2,797.05.
China raised interest rates for the third time since October in an effort to keep prices from rising too rapidly. The country's economic boom has resulted in higher prices, forcing some poor families to spend up to half of their incomes on food.
Many large companies in the United States have counted on spending in China for growth. Previously, interest rate increases in China have led to stock losses in the United States because of fears that spending there would fall.
Brian Gendreau, a market strategist at the Financial Network Investment Corporation, said investors were becoming less concerned about slower spending in China because they were more confident that the United States economy would grow on its own.
"Raising interest rates is what the Chinese need to do when they have such an overheated economy," he said.
Bond prices fell, extending a week of losses and sending their yields higher. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 25/32, to 90 31/32, and the yield rose to 3.74 percent from 3.63 percent late Monday.
The government auctioned $32 billion of three-year notes at a yield of 1.34 percent, the highest borrowing rate the government has had to pay on those notes since last May. Interest from foreign buyers was relatively weak.
Better economic news, including a drop in the unemployment rate, has led investors to sell low-yielding government bonds over the last two weeks. Some of that money is going into stocks, especially those of large corporations that pay big dividends.
Quincy Krosby, a market strategist at Prudential Financial, said the Dow average had been benefiting from a flight of money out of bonds as conservative investors sought large, relatively stable companies like the 30 that make up the Dow industrials.
"If you were in bonds, chances are you'll buy the large companies with strong balance sheets," Mr. Krosby said.
Walt Disney rose 3.7 percent in after-hours trading. The company reported earnings after the market closed that beat expectations, helped in part by higher advertising revenue at its ESPN and ABC television networks.
Avon Products fell 3 percent to close at $28.47 after its fourth-quarter earnings fell and missed expectations.

Abstract: A general increase in wages in Germany, which has the largest economy in the euro area, would press the European Central Bank to raise interest rates, even though countries like Spain and Ireland are still struggling with slow growth.

Full text: FRANKFURT -- Volkswagen employees agreed to a wage deal Tuesday that ensured them a larger share of soaring profit in the German auto industry and might signal an end to a decade in which pay barely kept pace with inflation.
"The time for ultralow wage increases in Germany is over," said Jorg Kramer, the chief economist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.
But he and other analysts said that the agreement at Volkswagen, the largest European carmaker, would not have much immediate effect on its rivals or other manufacturers, because their labor contracts do not expire until next year.
That means that, for now, the deal is unlikely to increase the already worrisome inflation rate, or the pressure on the European Central Bank to raise official interest rates.
"I don't think it will have any effect on European monetary policy," Rolf Schneider, who is in charge of macroeconomic research at the German insurer Allianz, said of the VW agreement.
The German economic boom has been driven partly by demand in China and other emerging markets for Volkswagen, Mercedes and BMW cars. Bayerische Motoren Werke said Tuesday that sales of BMW, Mini and Rolls-Royce brand vehicles rose 28 percent in January from a year earlier, as sales in the United States and Europe also recovered.
Audi, a unit of Volkswagen that competes with BMW in the market for premium cars, said that its unit sales rose 23 percent last month, delivering the best January for the brand.
One reason for Germany's export boom and competitiveness in world markets is that, for a decade, workers have accepted modest wage increases in return for more job security. Now, with German unemployment declining and oil prices putting pressure on consumers, economists have been alert for signs that the period of wage restraint is ending.
After a long bargaining session in Hanover that ended early Tuesday, the IG Metall union and Volkswagen agreed to give employees a 3.2 percent increase in base pay, plus a bonus equal to 1 percent of pay and no less than 500 euros, or $680.
Unlike Daimler and BMW, Volkswagen negotiates directly with IG Metall. In Germany, wage negotiations typically take place at a regional level between industry groups and unions.
A general increase in wages in Germany, which has the largest economy in the euro area, would press the European Central Bank to raise interest rates, even though countries like Spain and Ireland are still struggling with slow growth. Economists say that monetary policy is already too loose for Germany, as the bank focuses on helping the weaker members of the euro area.
Yet, the pressure from German wages has not been alarming. Mr. Kramer said that only a quarter of the unionized workers in Germany could negotiate a pay raise this year, so the overall increase in pay for workers covered by collective bargaining would be only an estimated 1.8 percent.
"The end of ultralow wage increases will be fully reflected only next year," Mr. Kramer said.
Ralph Wiechers, chief economist of the German Engineering Federation, an industry group, said that many companies still had workers on short shifts and had not fully recovered from the recession of 2009.
The need to preserve jobs at these companies will help restrain wage demands next year. "Lots of companies are still a long way from their all-time highs," Mr. Wiechers said.

Abstract: January's report from the Institute for Supply Management on the huge services sector of the United States economy showed the strongest figure in six years. Over the years, it has collected a big portfolio of companies in all kinds of industries, including network analyzers and makers of microscopes and hand tools.

Full text: The stagflationists are losing the argument. The world is inflating and that's a worry. But inflation is coming from growth that seems increasingly strong and from money that's looking far too loose for a reviving world. The risk is that oil and other commodities will soar much higher now, as they did in 2008, only this time the spike may not recede quickly.
The chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke, cannot be held responsible for social unrest in developing countries. But there's a link between ultra-loose money and global asset prices. The Fed has successfully pursued an ultra-loose monetary policy to help avert a second depression. But the $600 billion printing looks like a precautionary overdose whose inflationary influence is widespread.
Oil at close to $100 a barrel is injecting inflation into the world economy. Political unrest is a secondary factor. Food and other commodity prices -- less sensitive to Middle East unrest -- are also surging. Global price increases are now a big risk.
The cause? Most Western economies are out of their hole and joining in emerging economies' growth fest. January's report from the Institute for Supply Management on the huge services sector of the United States economy showed the strongest figure in six years.
There are problems here for both developed and developing economies. As Charles Bean, deputy governor of the Bank of England, said last week, if external inflation is very strong, then the central bank will have little choice but to clamp down harder on domestic sources of inflation, even in a still weakly recovering economy like Britain. The president of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, talked down expectations of a rate increase, suggesting that energy-driven inflation would be transitory. If the world is indeed gathering steam, he may be wrong.
Australia's central bank has just raised its growth forecast for the coming years. Rates are rising around the globe. China, India and Brazil have tightened. So, too, has Indonesia. The West will have to follow. For inflated asset markets there will be risks. But the shift from ultra-loose to tighter monetary policy is going to have to happen soon.
Danaher Dealing
Danaher has snatched the medical group Beckman Coulter for $5.8 billion, outbidding buyout firms in the process. The deal shows that despite relatively easy credit, private equity isn't the only acquirer that can pay up.
With private equity for competition, Danaher wasn't going to nab Beckman on the cheap. Big-name buyout consortiums were involved, including a Blackstone and TPG combo and another team of Apollo and the Carlyle Group. Those people these days can borrow as much as seven times a target company's earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.
That's why Danaher is paying a 45 percent premium to Beckman's value back in December. Despite that, though, the deal works -- a lesson in how a different kind of buyer can sometimes win auctions. Danaher isn't quite the traditional strategic player. Over the years, it has collected a big portfolio of companies in all kinds of industries, including network analyzers and makers of microscopes and hand tools. Though all those deals were far smaller than the Beckman deal, it has made more than 50 acquisitions since 2007. That suggests financial engineering skills alongside a strategic interest in Beckman.
Here's how the numbers stack up. With relatively little debt on its balance sheet, Danaher can afford to borrow 60 percent of the enterprise value of the deal. It will pay for the rest with cash and by selling new equity, helping to maintain its credit rating and flexibility.
So far, so good. But it's hard to see how Danaher could have beaten more highly leveraged buyout barons. Cost cuts with the company's existing businesses make the difference. After tax at Danaher's recent rate of around 20 percent, these have a present value of around $2 billion. That more than covers the deal premium of about $1.8 billion.
Together with a purchase of a company at a lower valuation multiple than its own -- roughly eight times forecast Ebitda for Beckman this year, against 11 times for Danaher -- that means the buyer will see increased earnings without giving away the farm on price. No wonder investors took the unusual step of giving the acquirer's shares a boost as well as the target's.

Full text: Starting salaries for women who become physicians are significantly lower than men's, and the pay gap has grown over the past decade, a study reports.
The pay differential, which was 12.5 percent in 1999, increased to nearly 17 percent by 2008, according to the report, published Thursday in Health Affairs.
The growing gap could not be explained by women's preferences, the authors said. While women on average do choose lower-paying specialties and shorter workweeks than men, those disparities were less pronounced in 2008 than in 1999. Yet the pay differential has widened.
"That was the part that surprised and puzzled us," said one author, Anthony T. Lo Sasso, a professor of health policy at the University of Illinois at Chicago. "As you start moving forward in time closer to the present day, your ability to explain away that difference between men's and women's salaries essentially evaporates."
The research looked at more than 8,000 new physicians in New York State. In 1999, the women earned $151,600 on average, compared with $173,400 for men; by 2008, the figures were $174,000 for women and $209,300 for men. (The study adjusted for inflation.) After accounting for differences in their practices, the study concluded, the pay gap had increased to $16,819 in 2008, from $3,600 in 1999.

Full text: LONDON -- A central banker need not be loved, but at the least he should command respect -- and in Britain these days Mervyn King cannot count on either.
Mr. King, the donnish governor of the Bank of England, has been accused of presiding over the worst stagflation -- a dreaded combination of stagnant economic activity and rising inflation -- happening in any major developed economy. He has been condemned for flouting the bank's independence by publicly supporting the British government's deficit-cutting strategy.
As for the issue on which he may have most closely staked his reputation -- that Britain's large banks must increase capital levels well beyond international standards -- he so far has been ignored.
Doubts over Mr. King's inflation strategy come as European leaders are working to devise a unified strategy for dealing with sovereign debt woes in the region. Germany and France are pressing for concrete steps to harmonize fiscal spending by focusing on tax and pension issues, while weaker nations are struggling to bring down their deficits.
But with inflationary pressure picking up everywhere, the main topic of debate is expected to be how much longer the European Central Bank, like its counterpart in Britain, can resist the pressure to raise interest rates.
Not long ago, central bankers in the United States, the European Union and fast-growing emerging countries like Turkey and Brazil were being hailed. They were seen as having salvaged their economies by flooding their banking systems with enough money to help prevent a depression.
But now many of them are confronting the prospect that their powers are on the wane, as inflation begins to creep up and as growth in advanced industrial countries is hampered by high levels of government debt.
For a group accustomed to being influential -- the Federal Reserve's Ben S. Bernanke and Jean-Claude Trichet of the European Central Bank are facing challenges similar to Mr. King's, if less acute -- such diminution can come as a rude awakening. In a speech last month, Mr. King acknowledged his limited ability to combat the high levels of unemployment and increased inflation bedeviling Britain.
With food and energy prices increasing and the weakness of the British pound making imports more expensive, he said, monetary policy could not "alter the fact that, one way or another, the squeeze in living standards is the inevitable price to pay for the financial crisis and the subsequent rebalancing of the world and U.K. economies."
It sounded a bit like the last cry of the "incredible shrinking central banker."
"It was a defensive speech, and there is a degree of frustration in the forces that are beyond his control," said DeAnne S. Julius, the chairman of Chatham House, a research and analysis organization in London, and a former member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee.
Ms. Julius is a critic and argues not only that Mr. King is underestimating the inflationary winds but also that he is too extreme in urging that British banks take on more capital. "The pressure is on -- both in terms of banking reform and inflation," she said. "I do not think he has an easy life."
And then there is the issue of fiscal policy.
The British public could be in for an even rougher ride this year when the government's $:80 billion austerity program really starts to bite. That prospect looms even larger after recent indications that the economy, instead of continuing to grow, shrank by 0.5 percent in the last quarter.
Consumer prices rose at a 3.7 percent annual rate in December, reaching the highest level in two years and, for a 13th consecutive month, missing the Bank of England's target of 2 percent.
Mr. King declined to be interviewed. But people who have worked with him paint a picture of an innovative thinker who has an agreeable charm but can also be pugnacious and confrontational when challenged intellectually.
"Mervyn is not blessed with any doubts about his abilities," said Michael Foot, chairman of the Promontory Financial Group consulting company in London and a former Bank of England executive.
But the accumulation of pressures seems to be having its effect. His January speech, while carrying all the quirky earmarks of a King address -- he began and ended with quotes from "Anna Karenina" -- came across to many analysts as unusually prickly rather than as a measured analysis of the British economy.
"There is a misapprehension in some quarters that the monetary policy committee could have prevented the squeeze in living standards by raising interest rates over the past year to bring inflation below its present level," Mr. King said in the speech. "That view is a misunderstanding of how monetary policy works."
Two members of the bank's policy making committee recently expressed public disagreement with Mr. King's insistence that Britain's current inflation rate had been driven by outside shock factors and that interest rates should not be increased. He has also been accused by another board member, Adam Posen, of jeopardizing the bank's independence by talking up the Conservative-led government's deficit-cutting strategy.
Since the Bank of England was made independent from the Treasury in 1997, its governors have been appointed by the government but have been viewed as apolitical, with a focus on ensuring price stability -- and with no business sharing their views on fiscal policy. Mr. King, whose second and final term will end in 2013, appeared to have moved beyond that understanding when he endorsed the coalition government's plan to cut the deficit faster than the opposition Labour Party had suggested when it was still in power.
The fear, some economists said, is that his endorsement creates expectations that he would be willing to neglect inflation for a while in order to let the government's spending cuts work.
To Mr. King's defenders, however, those who raise such fears do not know the heavy burden of running the Bank of England from its palace-like base on Threadneedle Street at the heart of the City, as London's financial district is known. Indeed, Mr. King has plenty of fans who praise him for the power of his convictions -- unpopular as they may be.
On the subject of being too close to the Tories on cutting the deficit, his defenders point to leaked cables in which Mr. King raised doubts about the experience of the Conservative leader, David Cameron, and his chief economic adviser, George Osborne.
"He is a king, a monarch in the classic sense, and he is fulfilling his duty to advise, consider and warn," said Michael Fallon, a Conservative member of Parliament who has questioned Mr. King numerous times as a member of the Treasury select committee. "Our public finances were in a deeper mess than others, and he has helped shape that debate."
Mr. King has also attracted a strong following -- largely outside British banking circles -- for his aggressive campaign to reduce the leverage of Britain's banks. He laid out his case in a hard-hitting address late last year in New York.
As Mr. King pointed out in that speech, Britain's banks pose unusual risks because they have assets 4.5 times the size of the British economy. How to scale that back is the subject of a much anticipated independent inquiry here, led by John Vickers, a former Bank of England chief economist and head of the Office of Fair Trading.
Mr. King has been careful to not prejudge the result. He has made clear, though, that his view is that radical changes must come, saying in his speech that of the systems one might use to organize banks, "the worst is the one we have today."

Full text: IN 1972, Edward N. Lorenz gave a talk that turned out to be a landmark in the development of chaos theory. Its title was "Predictability: Does the Flap of a Butterfly's Wings in Brazil Set Off a Tornado in Texas?"
Dr. Lorenz said that even a tiny action -- the flapping of a gossamer wing -- could set off a train of events leading to a violent storm in another hemisphere. This is "deterministic chaos," the recognition that the world is so complex that certain outcomes cannot be accurately predicted.
Dr. Lorenz was a meteorologist, but his insights are applicable in many fields -- notably including finance, where obscure local events have periodically been transformed into major storms in distant markets. Last week on Wall Street, there was, at least, the question of whether such a phenomenon was already under way: Is it possible that protests on the streets of Egypt will derail the bull market in the United States?
It isn't very likely that they will. But the risks are being widely assessed.
Bob Doll, chief equity strategist at BlackRock, the asset management firm, says disturbances in Egypt could conceivably prompt a market correction in New York. "Since Aug. 26, the stock market has gone up in what was almost a straight line," Mr. Doll said. "As you know, the market never moves in a straight line for very long."
Concern about Egypt has already caused some hiccups, he said. While he is bullish about the market's long-term prospects, he said, "sooner or later, we are going to have a real correction. Could this be it? I don't know. It could be."
He says Egypt is not the most likely source of problems for global markets. Although its geopolitical importance is indisputable -- it has about 80 million people, and the Suez Canal is an indispensable link in trade routes between Europe and Asia -- its weight in the world economy is negligible.
Audrey Kaplan, co-head of international equity at Federated Investors and manager of the Federated InterContinental fund, says her fund owns no Egyptian shares. "We've considered it too risky to hold," she said. "We've viewed it that way for quite a while."
And Kevin Gardiner, the head of global investment strategy for Barclays Wealth, said that while "the human implications of what is going on in Egypt are very important," so far, at least, the financial implications are not.
In a survey of the world economy, Mr. Gardiner said the overall outlook was positive, but he started his discussion with a description of the disturbing ripples emanating from Egypt. "Last month, I'm sure I wouldn't even have mentioned Egypt," he said.
Are investors merely reacting prudently to the latest news headlines? Quite possibly. But it isn't hard to envision Egypt's unrest morphing into a global nightmare.
The most unsettling scenarios include a major war and terrorism spreading from the Middle East and South Asia, accompanied by an oil shock and a depression. Even if such developments are extremely unlikely, investors may worry about them if demonstrations intensify and governments topple.
Because financial markets are barometers of investors' moods, worries can be pernicious. On Jan. 28, for example, riot police in Cairo fired tear gas and rubber bullets on crowds challenging President Hosni Mubarak. Global stock markets fell sharply -- the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 1.8 percent -- while the dollar, Treasuries and gold rose. The markets have been intermittently jumpy since then.
Short of violence, rising oil prices may be the most obvious way to transmit contagion from Egypt, even though it isn't an important oil producer. But about 4.5 percent of global oil supplies flow through the Suez Canal and the Sumed pipeline connecting the Red Sea with the Mediterranean, and 14 percent of global liquefied natural gas moves through the canal. No serious disruptions have occurred, but the markets have reacted anyway, perhaps factoring in the possible risk of blockages or, far worse, of turmoil spreading to a crucial producer like Saudi Arabia.
In the United States, there could be serious repercussions. If oil prices rise, every 25-cent-a-gallon increase in the price of gasoline -- which is equivalent to a $10.70-a-barrel increase in crude oil -- would result in a decline of 0.25 percent in annual gross domestic product and in the loss of 270,00 jobs, according to a study by IHS Global Insight. Nariman Behravesh, the research firm's chief economist, says that he does not expect current unrest to cause a sustained spike. "That would be a low-probability event," he said.
He says he expects that the United States economy will grow 3.2 percent this year -- and that demand in the United States and abroad is likely to cause oil prices to rise gradually. "That wouldn't be unhealthy," he said.
Food price inflation could be a carrier of contagion. In developing countries like Egypt, where food accounts for a major slice of average income, such inflation is becoming a major problem. Hoarding, exacerbated by civic unrest in Egypt and elsewhere, could lead to greater price spikes, Mr. Behravesh said.
While that isn't likely to be much of a problem for consumers in the United States, indirect effects are possible. Investors could become skittish about emerging markets, and highly leveraged bets on local currencies or indexes could go awry, with consequences that are impossible to predict. That may be unlikely, but not far-fetched.
Recall the events of 1997: a currency plunge in Thailand turned out to be the impetus for a broader crisis. It led to a Russian debt default and the near-collapse of Long-Term Capital Management, a hedge fund in Connecticut that, for a time, threatened the stability of the global financial system.
BUT there is no evidence of such a threat now. Should investors bother to protect themselves against improbable but potentially serious events emerging from the crisis in Egypt?
Most people should "just sit tight," Mr. Gardiner said, as "we haven't seen anything that looks like systemic risk for a portfolio."
Still, he said, it depends on how nervous you are. If your main concern is oil prices, for example, you can buy call options on oil futures. And there are plenty of exchange-traded funds and other vehicles for making bets.
Of course, there are countless other spots on the planet to worry about, many of them still well below the radar of the financial markets. What should an investor do? Exercise too much caution, and you will miss many opportunities. Ignore all danger, and you are likely to suffer.
There is no simple answer, alas. Butterflies can cause tornadoes, but those storms can't be predicted.

IN TURKEY'S EXAMPLE,
Some See a Map for Egypt
Arriving at a template that effectively integrates Islam, democracy and vibrant economics has been a near-impossible dream for Middle East reformers. But no country in the region has come closer to accomplishing this trick than Turkey. As a result, diplomats and analysts have begun to present the still-incomplete Turkish experiment as a possible road map for Egypt. Page 10
RECONCILING A PAINFUL PAST
The restoration of Iraq's Victory Arch, two enormous sets of crossed swords that stand as one of the most audacious symbols in Baghdad of Saddam Hussein's oppressive rule, represents a small but potentially significant act of reconciliation with a past that remains deeply divisive nearly eight years after Mr. Hussein's government crumpled. Page 6
PUNISHED FOR LEAVING ISLAM
Afghanistan's Constitution, established in 2004, guarantees that people are "free to exercise their faith." But it also leaves it open for the courts to rely on Shariah, or Islamic law, on issues like conversion. One Afghan, Sayed Mussa, is facing a potential death sentence for his conversion to Christianity from Islam nine years ago. Page 8
AN ARGENTINE FOE RETURNS
High inflation, a weakness of the Argentine economy for decades, is soaring again. Independent economists say the country's inflation rose by 25 percent to 30 percent in 2010, the highest level since the calamitous 2002 devaluation that sent the economy into a tailspin. Food-price increases began to outstrip wage increases in 2010, leading Argentines to buy less food, private economists say. Page 16

THE EARTHQUAKE SWARM
Thousands of earthquakes have been felt in the small town of Guy, Ark., since the late summer. Though none of them have been very large and have left negligible documented damage, in their sheer numbers they have been relentless, creating a phenomenon that has come to be called the Guy earthquake swarm.

Full text: Even the most disciplined savers are heavily relying on the stock market to reach their retirement goals. But that often amounts to a giant gamble, which is the thrust of the thinking behind a new retirement planning program that treats investing in stocks like a trip to the casino.
In this program, however, you lose every single bet you make. In other words, if you invest 60 percent of your contributions to retirement savings in stocks each year, that money is treated as if it were lost on the craps tables. But the program also shows the chances that all will not be lost.
Even during the latest market crash, people generally didn't lose all of their money, so why model for Armageddon? Market returns are not a sure thing, obviously. And the point of the program, called Upside Investing, is to establish a stable, guaranteed standard of living over the course of your entire life by showing you how much to save and spend.
So the program only allows you to spend the money it considers safe - that is, money not in stocks. It also shows the probabilities that you will have more money to spend each year, and how much.
The program is a new feature of the ESPlanner financial planning software, developed by Laurence J. Kotlikoff, an economics professor at Boston University who has been perfecting his software for several years. Upside Investing still feels like a work in progress, and combing through the results will require more time (and patience) than your typical online program.
But the results can be illuminating. Going through the exercise shows the risks of investing in the market, by listing how much you should be spending now to ensure a steady standard of living.
"This treats investing in the market like going to the casino with a fixed amount of money you are prepared to lose," Mr. Kotlikoff said, "and not spending your winnings until you leave the slot machine."
First, some background: The program is based on the "economics approach" to financial planning. The goal is to adapt your saving and spending behavior so that you can attain the highest stable standard of living over time, or what Mr. Kotlikoff refers to as your floor. When you play around with the program, you'll see that investing more money in the stock market improves the odds that you'll have more money to spend, but it also lowers your floor (or the bare minimum you are guaranteed to have each year if you follow the program's suggestions).
Conventional financial planning programs, meanwhile, usually focus on achieving a specific goal, like a target amount in your portfolio when you retire or replacing a percentage of the income you earned during your working years, say 75 percent. Mr. Kotlikoff argues that those targets are generally far off base.
***
The program costs $60. (That's $40 annually for an up-to-date version of the ESPlanner Basic retirement planning program that allows you to save your data, and an additional $20 for Upside Investing.)
You start by entering your basic information (birth date, family members, etc.), and choosing the "Upside Investing" method of planning. You also need to choose a rate of return for your "safe" money. Since Mr. Kotlikoff believes that Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS, are the only truly "safe" asset -- they keep pace with inflation, and are backed by the United States government -- the default is set at 2 percent, or about what the securities yield now. That's why he believes TIPS should substitute for conventional bonds. So the program assumes that whatever is not invested in stocks is in TIPS.
I ran the numbers for a 35-year-old New Yorker who earns $75,000 a year and pays $1,100 in rent each month. She's already saved $50,000 for retirement, contributes 10 percent of her salary to a 401(k) plan, and receives a 2 percent matching contribution. Her retirement portfolio is composed of 70 percent stocks and 30 percent TIPS, and she expects to retire at age 67. Users need to decide when to start converting their stock money to TIPS (remember, the program allows you to spend money only once it's safe), so I chose to have her start converting at age 55. Her portfolio is completely converted by age 95.
Once you enter all of your information through a series of drop-down menus (be sure to look to the far right of the screen for helpful hints), it takes about 35 seconds for the program to generate suggestions for you.
You can click through the detailed results using the tabs on the left side of the screen, under "View Plan." After paying her rent, she has $2,000 a month to spend on everything else (or $24,000 annually for the rest of her life, assuming her stocks lose all of their value). "Anytime you spend more than that, you are taking a gamble that your living standard will drop below that floor in the future," Mr. Kotlikoff said.
But the program says she needs to save an additional $12,275 this year. That's above and beyond the $7,500 she's already saving, since 70 percent of that money, which is in stocks, can be lost. In other words, the program is suggesting that she sock away 25 percent of her salary. That's the price of a risk-free retirement plan.
The problem, of course, is that most people either can't or don't want to save that much. Instead, they're willing to bet that the stock market will deliver (at least something), which will give them some more wiggle room today.
"This behavior may be too cautious for half the population," Mr. Kotlikoff says. "But for the other half, it may be exactly what they are looking for."
This advice is not without its own set of weaknesses. You could end up dying with a pile of money after years of giving up even the smallest of niceties.
You can actually view the odds, or likelihood, of having a higher living standard for each year of your life under the Upside Investing tab. Five percent of the time, our worker gets to spend $57,170 or more at age 67. And 25 percent of the time, she gets to spend $40,158 or more.
The likelihood of having to live at the floor -- that is, the guaranteed amount -- declines through time. But the risk-averse among you can rest assured that the amount will never dip below that figure.
To increase your guaranteed standard of living, you need to lower your stock allocation (which will also limit your potential upside). So I reran the numbers, reducing our 35-year-old's stock allocation to 50 percent from 70 percent.
She doesn't gain that much. With the lower stock exposure, she can spend only an additional $2,362 a year for the rest of her life. And at age 67, she will get to spend $48,719 or more 5 percent of the time, down from $57,170 with the higher stock exposure.
Bottom line: She gives up a lot of potential upside later, for a small increase in spending today.
The idea, Mr. Kotlikoff said, is to run the software each year to give you a sense of how much you can safely spend as your life changes.
Some of the program's results really need some more explanation or clarification, and that can throw you off track at times. For instance, the program assumes that you put the extra money it suggests that you save into a regular savings or brokerage account. Most people would probably want to save that money in a tax-deferred or tax-sheltered account of some kind. But it's basically up to you to go back and figure out how much of that money you should re-direct into your 401(k) or I.R.A. You also can't override the program's assumption that you will live until 100.
In the end, however, the costs of a risk-free path to retirement become quite clear. It's probably too high a bar for many families to clear on their own, which means they'll continue to roll the dice in the market, at least to some degree.
But at least you'll know how much you stand to lose -- and how it will affect your lifestyle.
What do you think about this approach to financial planning? Please share your thoughts below.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration said on Friday that China's currency remained "substantially undervalued" compared with the dollar but declined once again to cite Beijing for currency manipulation.
The administration cited commitments made by the Chinese president, Hu Jintao, during a state visit here last month to promote "exchange rate reform" and allow greater "exchange rate flexibility."
In a twice-a-year report required by Congress, the Treasury Department reiterated its view that China's longstanding management of the exchange rate ran the risk of worsening inflation in China, expanding the supply of credit too quickly and potentially destabilizing the country's robust economic growth.
American officials have long contended that China's currency policy has the effect of making Chinese exports to the United States cheaper, and American goods flowing to China more costly, than they otherwise would be.
The report concluded that China had not met the standard for currency manipulation -- a legal designation that could initiate economic retaliation by the United States -- in light of its pledge last June to allow the currency, the renminbi, to move more freely. The pace of the renminbi's appreciation has accelerated in recent months, and Mr. Hu pledged last month to build on that progress.
"Treasury's view, however, is that progress thus far is insufficient and that more rapid progress is needed," the report stated.
In nominal terms, the renminbi has appreciated against the dollar by about 3.6 percent since last summer. But after adjusting for China's higher rate of inflation, and the relative weight of China's share of world trade, the renminbi has appreciated 5 to 6 percent relative to the dollar -- or as much as 10 percent on an annualized basis.
That movement -- which is similar to the appreciation China permitted from 2005 to 2008 -- has prompted the administration to soften its tone on the issue.
"I smell a deal here: deafening silence from the Americans in return for, maybe, some kind of commitment from the Chinese to let the rate move," said C. Fred Bergsten, the director of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a research organization here.
Last September, the House overwhelmingly approved a bill seeking to add pressure on China to allow its currency to rise in value. But the new Republican leadership in that chamber is divided on the issue.
In the Senate, Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana and the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, expressed disappointment with the new report, saying in a statement: "China has been given a free pass on its currency practices for far too long. We need to hold China and our other trading partners accountable for their actions, and we must acknowledge -- and take steps to remedy -- those actions that harm the competitiveness of American businesses and workers."

Abstract: [...] it was said, the unemployment rate is based on a survey of only 60,000 households, some of whom cannot be reached in any given month. [...] the rate at the end of 1983 turned out to be 8.3 percent.

Full text: The unemployment rate declined four-tenths of a percentage point in one month. There had not been a monthly decline that large in many years, but economists were unimpressed. After all, the decline was caused in no small part by a surprising reduction in the labor force, which could be an indication that more workers were discouraged and no longer looking. That would hardly be an encouraging development.
Anyway, it was said, the unemployment rate is based on a survey of only 60,000 households, some of whom cannot be reached in any given month. It can be volatile, so you should not pay much attention to it. The president took heart from the figures, but critics said there was no real improvement.
The above describes what happened a month ago, when the unemployment rate for December came in at 9.4 percent. It was the first time in more than 11 years that the rate had declined that much in a single month, but the headline in The Chicago Tribune read, "U.S. jobs picture gets darker; Unemployment rate dips, but only because workers apparently are giving up."
As it happened, those paragraphs also describe the situation 28 years ago. In January 1983, with President Ronald Reagan reeling from his large setback in the midterm elections the previous November, the unemployment rate fell to 10.4 percent from 10.8 percent. It was the first such decline in five years, but few thought it significant.
"The A.F.L.-C.I.O.," The Washington Post reported, "said yesterday that there was no real improvement in unemployment last month because the decline was caused primarily by people dropping out of the labor force, rather than finding jobs."
The Reagan administration then thought the unemployment rate was likely to stay above 10 percent throughout that year. Now the Congressional Budget Office forecasts that the rate will stay above 9 percent this year.
In fact, the rate at the end of 1983 turned out to be 8.3 percent. Before last month's report, there had been only seven monthly reports during the previous 45 years that showed a decline of at least 0.4 percentage points. Three of them were in 1983.
There are other similarities. Then, as now, the stock market was surprisingly strong, but many people discounted that because of the obvious woes of the economy. I don't have a scientific measure, but I know that my e-mail inbox is getting a lot of messages offering conspiratorial explanations for the strong stock market. One reader asked if I had any evidence that Chinese manipulation was causing American share prices to rise. He did not respond when I asked why the Chinese would want to do that.
There are also many differences between then and now. The report on how many jobs were added during the month -- which got much less attention in those days -- was strong in January 1983, and disappointing last month, when it showed an increase of 103,000. But job figures are often revised substantially in subsequent reports, particularly at inflection points in economic growth.
The Labor Department has already disclosed that on Friday it will revise downward the number of jobs reported in the 12 months through March of last year. In other words, the depth of the recession was even worse than we thought. In the past, there have been substantial increases when the economy was strengthening, so the current figures may prove low.
On Friday, the January figures will be released. A quick upward move in the unemployment rate could indicate that the glum outlook may be justified.
But there are signs that the economy is doing better than some statistics would indicate. The first report on gross domestic product for the fourth quarter showed a surge in consumption spending, rising at an annual rate of 4.4 percent. Disposable personal income, adjusted for inflation, rose at a rate of only 1.7 percent. It was the fastest growth in consumption since early 2006, but the overall report was viewed as disappointing.
The consensus seems to be that consumers are back to their old bad habit of borrowing and spending, and that such an increase cannot be sustained. After all, their incomes are not rising, so how else could they be getting the money except by borrowing it?
The trouble with that analysis is that there is no evidence people are borrowing more, at least not in the consumer credit figures released by the government. They show that outstanding borrowings are coming down, not going up.
There is a good chance that the income numbers in the G.D.P. report will be revised up when better data is available. That happened back in 1983.
The first indication of whether that will happen will come four months from now. The earliest estimates of personal income are based solely on the Labor Department's job survey, according to Carol Moylan, the chief of the National Income and Wealth Division of the Bureau of Economic Analysis, which compiles the G.D.P. figures. Next month the third-quarter figures will be revised to reflect more reliable statistics from reports companies file when they pay unemployment insurance premiums. The fourth-quarter figures will be available at the end of May.
Those same reports will be the basis for the final figures on job growth -- the ones you see when you look at history. From 1979 through March 2009 -- the last month to have a benchmark revision -- the median change from the first number to the final one was up or down 71,000 jobs.
Back in 2008, those who were confident there was no recession pointed to the job figures. From April through July, the first reports for each month showed a loss that averaged less than 50,000 jobs. "That is not what you see in a recession," it was said, correctly. The government now says the average loss of jobs during those months was nearly 200,000.
That record of inaccuracy does not seem to bother the Federal Reserve. On Thursday, its chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, made clear that other positive indicators could not overcome the one everyone watches. "Until we see a sustained period of stronger job creation," he said in a speech at the National Press Club, "we cannot consider the recovery to be truly established."
The list of things that could go wrong is long now. Strife in Arab countries has pushed up oil prices. Europe is focused on whether more countries will need bailouts. Foreclosures continue in the United States, and the banks are still finding out just how much the mortgage debacle will end up costing them. Long-term unemployment will remain a problem even if the overall unemployment rate falls rapidly.
Still, companies report that business is improving, and consumers appear to be willing to spend. Nearly everyone with a job got a raise in January, courtesy of Uncle Sam, who reduced payroll taxes.
Since early 2007, Rasmussen, a polling company, has been asking 275 Americans every night about how they and the economy are doing. The polling is done for Discover, the credit card company, which tries to monitor spending plans. The latest report indicates that consumers are gaining confidence, albeit from a low level.
In January, Discover says, 40 percent of Americans thought the economy was getting worse, while only 33 percent thought it was getting better.
That may not seem encouraging, but the level of pessimism was the lowest the survey had recorded. In May 2007, the survey's first month, more than 60 percent thought the economy was getting worse. It turned out they were correct, although in those days most economic indicators were strong.
Less pessimism is not the same thing as more optimism. But perhaps it will be enough to make 2011 a better year than the experts now expect.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, warned Congressional Republicans on Thursday not to "play around with" a coming vote to raise the government's legal borrowing limit or use it as a bargaining chip for spending cuts.
In remarks after a luncheon speech here, Mr. Bernanke sided with the Obama administration in the fight over the debt ceiling, which the government is on course to hit in April or May, saying it should be raised without conditions. Some Republicans have insisted on immediate spending cuts in exchange for raising the limit.
It was the first time that Mr. Bernanke, who in contrast to his predecessors has avoided taking sides in partisan debates on fiscal matters, had spoken out on the debt ceiling issue. His willingness to do so suggested a desire by the central bank to prevent Washington lawmakers from toying with bond markets that have been volatile since the European debt crisis last year.
House Republicans have vowed to make deep spending cuts a precondition for voting to lift the $14.3 trillion debt ceiling. The White House has described raising the ceiling as nonnegotiable, saying that spending cuts and tax increases should be considered separately. The increasingly tense debate has left Republican leaders, like the new House speaker, John A. Boehner, in a politically delicate spot.
Though he called on Congress and Mr. Obama to confront "daunting fiscal challenges," Mr. Bernanke said the debt ceiling should not be used as a negotiating tactic, warning that even the possibility of the United States not being able to pay its creditors could create panic in the debt markets.
"I think this is very remote, but it's not something you want to play around with -- the United States would be forced into a position of defaulting on its debt," Mr. Bernanke said. "And the implications of that for our financial system, for our fiscal policy, for our economy would be catastrophic."
He added: "So I would very much urge Congress not to focus on the debt limit as being the bargaining chip in this discussion, but rather to address directly the spending and tax issues that we all have to deal with if we're going to make progress on this fiscal situation."
Mr. Bernanke's remarks, which were made in response to questions at a luncheon at the National Press Club, underscored once again his delicate position as a moderate Republican economics professor who was appointed by President George W. Bush but won a second term last year with support from Mr. Obama and Congressional Democrats.
Mr. Bernanke also expressed urgency about fiscal reform, in terms of deficit spending, saying, "There is only so far that we can kick the can down the road."
He said, "We have to address this. And the sooner we do it, the less painful it will be and the better it will be for our economy."
In his prepared speech, Mr. Bernanke said the United States could not rely on economic growth to solve its long-term fiscal problems, emphasizing that the country would have to cut spending, raise taxes or both.
But as before, Mr. Bernanke declined to specify how the deficit -- about 9 percent of the nation's gross domestic product each of the last two years -- should be reduced.
He did, however, say that plans offered recently by a presidentially appointed fiscal commission and by other prominent groups "provide useful starting points for a much-needed national conversation." Those plans have called for revising entitlement programs like Medicare and Social Security and increasing tax revenue, though they differ on many specifics.
Mr. Bernanke's increasingly urgent warnings about the deficit have been welcomed by Republicans, but on Thursday he also indicated support for Mr. Obama's position that the debate over fiscal policy should take into account the need to improve the nation's economic competitiveness.
Mr. Bernanke said that tax and spending changes should "serve not only to reduce the deficit, but also to enhance the long-term growth potential of our economy -- for example, by reducing disincentives to work and to save, by encouraging investment in the skills of our work force as well as in new machinery and equipment, by promoting research and development, and by providing necessary public infrastructure."
Mr. Bernanke also reiterated his defense of the Fed's plan to lower long-term interest rates by buying $600 billion in Treasury securities. He called the bond-buying plan, which began in November and is to last through June, an appropriate response to high unemployment and low inflation.
Since August, when the Fed first signaled it was considering the strategy, Mr. Bernanke said, stock prices have "risen significantly," inflation expectations have remained fairly steady, and interest rates on corporate bonds have fallen relative to yields on comparable Treasury securities, suggesting that investors are more confident about the outlook for businesses and less worried about the risk of defaults.
Critics say the effort -- popularly known as QE2 because it is the second round of the bond-buying strategy known as quantitative easing -- could touch off future inflation in the United States and abroad, devalue the dollar and increase the cost of food, energy and other commodities in the developing world.
Mr. Bernanke said the United States was not to blame for inflation in emerging economies, which have been growing at a much faster rate than the rich economies of Western Europe, North America and Japan.
The inflationary pressures, Mr. Bernanke said, arise from long-term trends -- like the tendency of consumers to eat better as they move up from poverty, which tends to push up food prices -- and suggest that some economies are pushing the limits of their capacity for growth.
He said that "emerging markets have all the tools they need to address excess demand in those countries," and added, "They can adjust their exchange rates, which is something that they've been reluctant to do in some cases."
That was a clear reference to China, which has managed the value of its currency, the renminbi, in relation to the dollar.
On the eve of new unemployment figures for January that the Labor Department will report Friday, Mr. Bernanke predicted that "we'll start seeing some stronger payroll reports and some lower unemployment rates pretty soon," but cautioned that it would take years for the job market to return to normal.
He said that uncertainty about the recovery's durability was hampering firms from hiring. "Firms have been using a lot of temporary workers, because they can bring temporary workers on and if the economy weakens again, they can let them go," he said. "It'll be a really good sign when we see those temporary jobs being converted into permanent jobs."

Full text: WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- Growth in the nation's services sector in January was the fastest in more than five years, another sign the economy started 2011 on a solid footing, with measures of employment showing more strength.
Reports on Thursday, including a decline in weekly claims for jobless benefits, painted a strengthening picture for the economy as it recovered from the worst recession since the Great Depression.
Inflation pressures appeared mostly under control as businesses kept a tight grip on labor costs, the largest expense for most companies.
"Momentum from the end of 2010 is carrying over," said Robert Dye, a senior economist at PNC Financial Services in Pittsburgh. "It will be another year of recovery and repair."
The Institute for Supply Management's index of national nonmanufacturing activity rose to 59.4 last month, its highest level since August 2005, from 57.1 in December. Economists had expected a decline to 57.0.
A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the service sector, which accounts for more than 80 percent of the nation's jobs, and it was the 14th consecutive month of growth.
The surprise pickup in growth, which mirrored a similar acceleration in manufacturing in January, was further evidence that the economic recovery was broadening.
The Federal Reserve Chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, acknowledged the improvement in the recovery on Thursday but said the economy still needed help, citing persistently high unemployment.
Economists say they believe strengthening domestic demand will mean increased hiring.
A Labor Department report showed new claims for state jobless benefits fell 42,000, to a seasonally adjusted 415,000. Economists had expected claims to decline to 420,000.
The claims data falls outside the survey period for the closely watched payrolls report for January, due on Friday.
The economy probably created 145,000 jobs, according to a Reuters poll, after adding 103,000 in December. Reports on Wednesday suggested private hiring was gathering pace.
Expectations for a pickup in job growth were bolstered by a jump in the Institute for Supply Management's employment gauge to its highest since May 2006.
Heavy snow and cold weather slowed the downward trend in initial jobless claims by causing a backlog in applications, but economists say they believe claims will soon drop below 400,000, a level believed to signal strong job growth.
"We think the trend in claims is coming down because small firms are firing fewer people," said Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y. "With credit now easing, we are hopeful claims will fall significantly further over the next few months."
A second Labor Department report showed that although businesses faced rising input costs, they kept labor costs down by getting more from workers, helping keep inflation muted.
Nonfarm productivity, a measure of hourly output per worker, rose at an annual rate of 2.6 percent in the fourth quarter after rising at a 2.4 percent pace in the third quarter.
The increase, which was well above economists' expectations for a 2 percent growth rate, bodes well for company profits.
Unit labor costs, a gauge of potential inflation pressures closely watched by the Fed, fell at a 0.6 percent rate after dipping 0.1 percent in the third quarter.
"It's showing that even though we are seeing some sector-specific inflation among businesses that are exposed to commodities, that is not threatening to cut into profits," said Mr. Dye from PNC Financial Services.
Mr. Dye said he did not expect the rise in commodity prices to feed into so-called core inflation, which the Fed monitors, as overall economic conditions still remained slack. Core inflation strips out volatile food and energy costs.

Full text: HONG KONG - Nearly 25 years after the fictional financier Gordon Gekko declared in "Wall Street" that "lunch is for wimps," Asia's leading stock exchanges seem to have gotten the memo.
With investors' attention focused on the fast-growing markets, the region's main financial hubs are jockeying for dominance with a host of new efforts intended to increase their competitiveness on a global scale. As they move to gain share, local exchanges are upgrading their infrastructure, expanding their operations and even throwing out longstanding traditions like lengthy lunch breaks.
Such efforts come after a stellar year for the Asia-Pacific markets. Of the 20 exchanges that generated the highest proceeds from initial public offerings in 2010, half were located in the region, according to Thomson Reuters data. Hong Kong took the top spot, easily eclipsing global heavyweights like New York and London.
This year is looking tougher, though. Asian stock indexes are off to a rocky start with increasing concerns over rising inflation and other macroeconomic conditions. And the United States seems to be regaining some of its former I.P.O. strength, with several better-than-expected debuts in recent weeks.
"No one's expecting a year like last year, which makes the viability and the attractiveness of the exchange all the more important," said Gary N. Kleiman, senior partner at Kleiman International, a research firm based in Washington that specializes in emerging markets.
At the center of the push in Asia are Hong Kong and Singapore, both vying to be the region's pre-eminent financial domain for international investors. With an economic powerhouse in its backyard, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited has the commanding position, serving the booming Chinese market. I.P.O. volume topped $52 billion last year, compared with $5.1 billion in Singapore.
But the Singapore Exchange, known as SGX, is looking to broaden its global appeal. In October, SGX said it would buy the leading Australian stock market, ASX, for $8.3 billion. If the deal is approved, the combined entity will rank among the region's big hitters, which should make it more attractive to large institutional investors.
SGX landed a major victory last month when Li Ka-shing, the billionaire Hong Kong property magnate, said he planned to list his Chinese port assets in Singapore, where tax regulations are more favorable.
Singapore also plans to introduce a high-speed trading engine in August, which SGX says will be the fastest in the world. The software, according to the company, will allow trades to be completed in 90 microseconds, faster than the 98 microseconds the Nasdaq says it takes.
For Hong Kong, the onus is on securing its position as the gateway to China. While Shanghai and Shenzhen scored high in the I.P.O. rankings, the mainland markets remain largely closed to foreign investors, a reason many companies that list their securities in China also do so in Hong Kong.
To help cement that connection, Hong Kong said in November that it would extend its trading hours and shorten its lunch break, more closely aligning its schedule with that of Shanghai. Two months later, Singapore said it would eliminate its midday hiatus altogether.
"This lunch hour competition is a little bit of Hong Kong-Singapore one-upmanship," Mr. Kleiman said. "It's the battle for Asian dominance after a record year of capital inflows."
The lunch hour is the last vestige of a bygone colonial era. While London shed its more laidback habits more than 60 years ago, the British influence has lingered in Asia for decades.
"When I first arrived it was very British: there was a mandatory half-day on Saturday where people would sit around and read newspapers and clean up their desk," said Todd Martin, an equity strategist in Hong Kong for the French bank Societe Generale, who has worked in Asian markets for the past 18 years.
"The Asian crisis changed all that," Mr. Martin, a Canadian citizen, said, referring to the financial shock that destabilized many economies in the region in the late 1990s. "It really shook up the old industry and a lot of the old British brokers."
Now, the lunch break is disappearing, too - a move that's rather controversial in Hong Kong and Singapore. Stockbrokers and other market professionals point out that they don't simply put their feet up on the desk or go out for a long, leisurely meal. Many spend the time meeting with clients and attending business events like I.P.O. presentations.
"It's terrible," said Francis Lun, general manager at Fulbright Securities in Hong Kong. "I think they think the employees can work like machines."
Some also argue the extended trading hours put smaller trading firms at a disadvantage, given the costs of adding staff. It's also unclear whether the extra hours will translate into higher trading volumes and bigger profits. Resistance from local firms is one reason that established Asian exchanges have hung on to lunch breaks for so long.
"It is easier for local brokerages that are smaller to work with fewer people if the lunch breaks are present," said Anshuman Jaswal, a capital markets analyst based in Bangalore for the financial consulting firm Celent.
But lunch breaks have also proved problematic, say traders. For one, the computer trading programs on which many firms rely don't function as effectively if stock activity stops in the middle of the day, said Hani Shalabi, who oversees the electronic stock trading for Credit Suisse clients in the Asia-Pacific region.
The changes also greatly reduce so-called gap risk, when a stock price moves significantly after news that comes out in the off hours.
"Anything could happen, war could break out," Mr. Shalabi said. "Weekend gap risk is massive. Lunch is the same thing, but to a smaller extent."
His job is to help smooth out the potential bumps such situations can create for his clients as he supervises computers delving into multiple markets across the region. All of which does not leave a lot of time for three-course meals.
"We're eating at our desk no matter what happens," Mr. Shalabi said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

GLOBAL FOOD PRICES RISE
For Seventh Straight Month
Global food prices are moving ever higher, hitting record levels in January as a jittery market reacted to unpredictable weather and tight supplies, according to a United Nations report. It was the seventh month in a row of food price increases. With some basic food stocks low, prices will probably continue reaching new heights, at least until the results of the harvest next summer are known, analysts said. page A4
DROUGHT ALARMS CHINA
A severe drought in northern China has badly damaged the winter wheat crop and left the ground very dry for the spring planting, fueling inflation and alarming China's leaders. President Hu Jintao toured drought-stricken regions this week and called for "all-out efforts" to address the effects of water shortages on agriculture. page A4
PAKISTANIS FEAR UNREST
While the Pakistani government appeared unruffled, diplomats, analysts and other officials admitted to unease, and conceded that Pakistan contained many of the same ingredients for revolt found in the Middle East, like a poisonous resentment of the United States, Pakistan's biggest financial supporter.

PLAN TO CUT SPENDING
Falls Short of Pledge
House Republicans plan to cut federal spending this year by $32 billion, about one-third of the $100 billion in cuts that Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio promised before the November election. Republicans said that their cuts would fulfill their pledge to reduce discretionary spending to 2008 levels, but their unwillingness to propose steeper reductions reflected the difficulty of slashing spending on the scale demanded by some in their own party. Page A13
HEALTH CARE LAW DISPUTE
Virginia's attorney general announced that he hoped to bypass an initial appellate review by asking the United States Supreme Court to consider the constitutionality of the Obama health care law on an expedited basis. The commonwealth's attorney general said the legal confusion sown by conflicting lower-court opinions demanded a rapid resolution. Page A16
FINDINGS ON FORT HOOD
A new report finds that various federal intelligence and law enforcement agencies failed to prevent the 2009 shootings at Fort Hood that left 13 people dead and dozens injured, even though those agencies held information that the man charged in the attack had communicated with a terrorism suspect and held extreme political proclivities.

PROPOSAL SUGGESTS OPENING
Judicial Discipline Hearings
The Legislature will consider a proposal this year to open secret judicial discipline hearings to the public, as it has done periodically for years. However, some supporters of the measure predict that it will get more attention this year than it has for decades because of Albany's new focus on government ethics reform. The state Commission on Judicial Conduct will make opening its hearings a top legislative priority.

REGULATING DISCOUNT BUSES
A new bill to be introduced in Albany would place stricter regulations on the discount buses that businesses say clog up streets in Midtown and Chinatown. If approved, the bill would open the door for the city to establish designated pick-up and drop-off locations for the buses, and require a permit to operate in the city. Page A19

GERMANY'S PLAN FOR EURO
Asks Others to Follow Lead
Germany's chancellor, Angela Merkel, wants more economic integration in the euro zone, including regular meetings of its leaders. In exchange for bolstering the euro zone rescue fund, Mrs. Merkel will press others to mimic Germany's economic rise. She is proposing to coordinate retirement ages across countries, scrap any links between wages and inflation and bring corporate tax systems closer together.

RETAIL SALES EXCEED FORECAST
Despite the foul weather across the country, retailers kicked off 2011 with better-than-expected sales in January. Sales at stores open at least a year, a crucial indicator known as same-store sales, rose 4.2 percent in January compared with a 3.3 percent increase in the month a year ago and forecasts of 2.7 percent.

Two of Japan's largest steel makers said that they were in talks to merge, a move that would form the world's second-largest producer of steel after ArcelorMittal. The two companies, Nippon Steel and Sumitomo Metal, are considering merging by 2012. Page B3

PROPER MEDICAL TREATMENT

The Green Bay Packers might have saved their season through their handling of quarterback Aaron Rodgers's concussion on Dec. 12. Doctors kept him out against the Detroit Lions and a subsequent loss to New England, before ruling him recovered.

Full text: Two of Japan's largest steel makers said on Thursday that they were in talks to merge, a move that would form the world's second-largest producer of steel after ArcelorMittal.
Nippon Steel, Japan's largest steel producer, and Sumitomo Metal Industries, the country's third largest, are in talks to merge by October 2012, the two companies said in a statement. At their closing stock prices Thursday, they would have a combined market capitalization of 2.88 trillion yen, $35 billion, compared to $57 billion for ArcelorMittal.
A merger would help create economies of scale, enabling the companies to cut costs and ease the effect of rising prices for raw materials and a strong yen, which have weighed on their overseas earnings.
Japanese steel makers are also looking to expand overseas, motivated particularly by sluggish demand at home. Though the Japanese economy is likely to rebound in the first quarter after a slight contraction in the last three months of 2010, activity remains lackluster compared with that of its fast-growing Asian neighbors. By some measures, China overtook Japan last year as the world's second-largest economy behind that of the United States.
"Global competition in the steel industry is growing more intense, at a more rapid rate and to a greater extent than expected," Shoji Muneoka, representative director and president of Nippon Steel, said in a statement. The Japanese steel industry, meanwhile, "is confronted with drastic changes, such as stagnation of domestic demand, inflation of cost of resources and the strengthening of the Japanese yen," he said.
By uniting, the two companies hope to "dramatically develop business in the global market" and "strengthen the competitiveness of both companies," Mr. Muneoka said.
Several big deals have occurred in the last decade, including the merger in 2006 of Arcelor, based in Luxembourg, and Mittal Steel of India. At the time, the Arcelor deal was valued at 26.8 billion euros ($36.9 billion at today's exchange rates). In Japan, Kawasaki Steel and NKK merged in 2002 to form JFE Steel, now the world's fifth-biggest steel producer.
It was not immediately clear whether the merger of Nippon Steel and Sumitomo Metal would face regulatory difficulties. But the Japanese trade minister, Banri Kaieda, said on Thursday that he supported the deal.
"The merger aims to strengthen global competitiveness by reorganizing competition, as global competition heats up in the steel industry," he said. "I value such a move highly."
World steel production is surging, driven by strong economic growth in emerging markets like China. Global crude steel production hit a record 1.4 billion tons in 2010, an increase of 15 percent from the previous year, according to the World Steel Association.
The recent floods in Australia have contributed to rising costs of production by disrupting exports of coking coal, which is used to make steel. The disruptions have driven coking coal spot prices up by about 15 percent, to as much as $290 a ton.
Speaking at a conference on commodities in Geneva this week, Pascal Lamy, director of the World Trade Organization, warned of rising prices for crucial commodities through this year, a result of a rebound in the global economy.
ArcelorMittal, based in Luxembourg, was the world's top steel maker in 2009, producing 77.5 million tons, according to the steel association. Nippon Steel ranked fourth, after Baoshan Iron & Steel of China and Posco of South Korea, while Sumitomo Metal Industries ranked 19th.
Nippon Steel and Sumitomo Metal already hold minority stakes in each other and supply each other with partly finished products. They plan to set up a committee to develop a merger agreement by April 2012, and hope to merge the next October after gaining shareholder approval, Nippon Steel said in a statement. The companies have yet to decide on a merger ratio.
Japan is the world's second-biggest steel producer after China. Japan produced 109.6 million tons of crude steel in 2010, 25.2 percent higher than a year earlier, according to the World Steel Association. Meanwhile, China's crude steel production reached 626.7 million tons in 2010, an annual increase of 9.3 percent.
Nippon Steel booked revenue of 3.5 trillion yen ($43 billion) in the fiscal year that ended March 31, 2010, while Sumitomo Metal had revenue of 1.3 trillion yen in the same period.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text: UNITED NATIONS -- Global food prices are moving ever higher, hitting record levels last month as a jittery market reacted to unpredictable weather and tight supplies, according to a United Nations report released Thursday.
It was the seventh month in a row of food price increases, according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, which put out the report. And with some basic food stocks low, prices will probably continue reaching new heights, at least until the results of the harvest next summer are known, analysts said.
"Uncertainty itself is a new factor in the market that pushes up prices and will not push them down," said Abdolreza Abbassian, an economist and the grain expert at F.A.O. "People don't trust anyone to tell them about the harvest and the weather, so it has to await harvest time."
Scattered bright spots in the report led experts to suggest that a repeat of the 2008 food riots stemming from similar sharp price increases might not be imminent. Rice was slightly cheaper and meat prices stable, they noted. But the overall uncertainty and inflation could eventually make the situation worse than three years ago, they said.
Riots and demonstrations erupting across the Middle East are not directly inspired by rising food prices alone, experts noted, but that is one factor fueling the anger directed toward governments in the region. Egypt was among more than a dozen countries that experienced food riots in 2008.
The F.A.O. price index, which tracks 55 food commodities for export, rose 3.4 percent in January, hitting its highest level since tracking began in 1990, the report said. Countries not dependent on food imports are less affected by global volatility. Still, food prices are expected to rise 2 percent to 3 percent in the United States this year.
Four main factors are seen as driving prices higher: weather, higher demand, smaller yields and crops diverted to biofuels. Volatile weather patterns often attributed to climate change are wreaking havoc with some harvests. Heavy rains in Australia damaged wheat to the extent that much of its usually high-quality crop has been downgraded to feed, experts noted.
This has pushed the demand and prices for American wheat much higher, with the best grades selling at 100 percent more than they were a year ago, Mr. Abbassian said. The autumn soybean harvest in the United States was poor, so strong demand means stocks are at their lowest level in 50 years, he said.
Brokers are waiting to see how acreage in the United States will be divided between soybeans, corn and cotton, with cotton fetching record prices, Mr. Abbassian said.
Sugar prices are also at a 30-year high, he said. Prices for cereals are rising but still below their April 2008 peak. Oils and fats are up and close to their 2008 level, and dairy is higher but still below its 2007 peak, the report said. Even positive news, like good rains in Argentina and a strong harvest in Africa, has failed to keep prices from rising.
"Food prices are not only rising, but they are also volatile and will continue this way into the future," said Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, the World Bank managing director.
Changing diets around the world stemming from higher incomes, especially in places like China and India, mean a greater demand for meat and better grains. Although it takes time for that to translate into higher prices globally, it does buoy demand, the experts said.
In 2009, the richest nations pledged more than $20 billion to aid agriculture in developing countries, including $6 billion for a food security fund housed at the World Bank. Just $925 million of those pledges has been paid, Ms. Okonjo-Iweala noted, because of financial problems in the donor countries. That will bring consequences, she said, as one billion people already go without sufficient food daily.
Derek Headey, an economist with the International Food Policy Research Institute, noted that in 2007 and 2008 many African countries were hit hard by soaring import bills, as were nations spread across the world, like Afghanistan, Pakistan and Ecuador.
But some of the world's largest and poorest countries experienced rapid economic growth and only modest food inflation, so the number of people facing food insecurity in nations like China, India, Indonesia and Vietnam actually went down at that time, he said.
"This time around there is still strong economic growth in these countries, but inflation is much more of a problem," he said. "So it is possible that the impact could be worse in 2011, especially if food prices stay high."
It will take some months for those figures to emerge, he added.

Full text: HONG KONG -- A severe drought in northern China has badly damaged the winter wheat crop and left the ground very dry for the spring planting, fueling inflation and alarming China's leaders.
President Hu Jintao and Prime Minister Wen Jiabao separately toured drought-stricken regions this week and have called for "all-out efforts" to address the effects of water shortages on agriculture, state media reported on Thursday. Mr. Wen made a similar trip just 10 days ago and called for long-term improvements in water management.
Rising food prices were a problem last autumn, even before the drought began, prompting the government to impose a wide range of price controls in mid-November. The winter wheat crop has been parched since then in northern China while unusually widespread frost has hurt the vegetable crop in southern China. State media began warning a week ago that price controls on food might not be effective.
Some of the driest areas are close to Beijing, which has had no appreciable precipitation since Oct. 23, although there were brief snow flurries on Dec. 29. If the drought lasts 11 more days it will match one in the winter of 1970-71 as the longest since modern recordkeeping started in 1951, according to government meteorologists quoted by state media.
Particularly hard hit have been Hebei Province, which is next to Beijing and which Mr. Hu visited from Tuesday to Thursday, and southern Shandong Province to the east, which Mr. Wen visited on Wednesday and Thursday. The dirt in farmers' fields has become bone dry and is easily lifted by breezes, coating trees and houses in fine dust.
Food prices have been rising around the world, a result of weather problems in many countries, like the unusual heat wave in Russia last summer. High food prices have been among the many reasons for protests in Egypt and elsewhere in the Arab world.
But even a prolonged drought in China appears highly unlikely to cause acute food shortages. China has spent years accumulating very large government reserves of grain and also has $2.85 trillion in foreign exchange reserves, giving it virtually unlimited ability to import food as long as major grain producers do not limit exports.
When commodity prices last surged in 2007 and 2008, however, at least 29 countries sharply curbed food exports in attempts to prevent domestic food prices from rising as quickly as world prices. And if China does become a large importer of wheat -- it imports a lot of soybeans but tries to be essentially self-sufficient in rice and other grains for national security reasons -- then it could push up world prices and make it harder for poor countries to afford food imports.
Gary Blumenthal, chief executive of World Perspectives, a Washington-based agriculture trade consulting company, noted that wheat was grown in many countries and said that Chinese purchases would not necessarily result in a sustained jump in already high world prices. "The wheat market can restore any imbalances more readily than perhaps other grains," he said.
China's wheat imports have risen to 893,700 metric tons in 2009 and 1.2 million metric tons last year from just 31,900 metric tons in 2008, according to figures from Global Trade Information Services, a data company in Columbia, S.C.
But those totals are small compared with global output that according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations reached 682 million metric tons in 2009, the most recent year for which figures are available. China accounted for one-sixth of global wheat production that year, which could make a broad failure of the Chinese crop hard to replace immediately.
Higher food and energy prices are spreading to other parts of China's economy, contributing to broader inflation. Prices rose 4.6 percent last year, according to the consumer price index, but Chinese and Western economists say that the index understates the true extent of inflation because of methodology problems. The National Bureau of Statistics has said that it is trying to improve the index.
The government has cushioned the effects of rising food prices by encouraging provinces and cities to sharply raise the minimum wage, which has been climbing 18 percent a year in Guangdong Province, in southern China.
Accelerating inflation in China is starting to show up in the prices that American companies pay for imports from China. After years of showing little change, a United States Bureau of Labor Statistics index of average import prices suddenly jumped 0.3 percent from September to October, then jumped the same amount in November and again in December.
As many Chinese exporters demand double-digit percentage increases for the renewal of contracts this year, American buyers have delayed signing contracts, producing a hiccup in trans-Pacific trade. Shipping lines are discounting rates and canceling some sailings this spring while waiting for exporters and buyers to reach deals.
But imports from China are equal to only 2 percent of American economic output, so most economists expect inflation in China to have a limited effect on broad price indices in the United States.

Abstract: [...] while Mr. Gilani appeared unruffled, diplomats, analysts and other Pakistani officials admitted to unease, and conceded that Pakistan contained many of the same ingredients for revolt found in the Middle East -- and then some: an economy hollowed out by bad management and official corruption; rising Islamic religious fervor; and a poisonous resentment of the United States, Pakistan's biggest financial supporter. [...] the return to civilian government after a decade of military rule has meant little to the people because politicians have done nothing for voters, said Farrukh Saleem, a risk analyst and columnist in The News, a daily newspaper.

Full text: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan -- Protests over crippling prices and corrupt leadership are sweeping much of the Islamic world, but here in Pakistan this week, the government blithely dismissed any threat to its longevity or to the country's stability.
Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani insisted that Pakistan was not Egypt or Tunisia. "Our institutions are working and democracy is functional," he said. The economy, while under pressure, is not in crisis.
But while Mr. Gilani appeared unruffled, diplomats, analysts and other Pakistani officials admitted to unease, and conceded that Pakistan contained many of the same ingredients for revolt found in the Middle East -- and then some: an economy hollowed out by bad management and official corruption; rising Islamic religious fervor; and a poisonous resentment of the United States, Pakistan's biggest financial supporter.
If no one expects Pakistan to be swept by revolution this week, the big question on many minds is how, and when, a critical mass of despair among this nation's 180 million people and the unifying Islamist ideology might be converted into collective action.
Some diplomats and analysts compare the combustible mixture of religious ideology and economic frustration, overlaid with the distaste for America, to Iran in 1979. Only one thing is missing: a leader.
"What's lacking is a person or institution to link the economic aspirations of the lower class with the psychological frustration of the committed Islamists," a Western diplomat said this week. "Our assessment is: this is like Tehran, 1979."
Mr. Gilani is right in that Pakistan held fairly free elections three years ago, when the democratically based Pakistan Peoples Party, led by President Asif Ali Zardari, won.
But the return to civilian government after a decade of military rule has meant little to the people because politicians have done nothing for voters, said Farrukh Saleem, a risk analyst and columnist in The News, a daily newspaper.
As it has been for all of Pakistan's more than 60 years of history, Parliament today remains dominated by the families of a favored few, who use their perch to maintain a corrupt patronage system and to protect their own interests as Pakistan's landed and industrial class. The government takes in little in taxes, and as a result provides little in the way of services to its people.
"Ninety-nine percent of Pakistanis are not affected by the state -- it doesn't deliver anything for them," Mr. Saleem said. "People are looking for alternatives. So were the Iranians in 1979."
There is little question that the images from Egypt and Tunisia are reverberating through Pakistani society, and encouraging workers to speak up and vent frustration in ways that were unusual even three months ago.
"There's no electricity, no gas, no clean water," said Ali Ahmad, a hotel worker in Lahore who is usually a model of discretion. "I think if things stay the same, people will come out and destroy everything."
When a young banker in a prestigious job at a foreign bank was asked if Pakistan could go the way of Egypt, he replied, "I hope so."
At the core of Pakistan's problem are the wretched economic conditions of day-to-day life for most of the people whose lives are gouged by inflation, fuel shortages and scarcity of work.
They see the rich getting richer, including "the sons of rich, corrupt politicians and their compatriots openly buying Rolls-Royces with their black American Express cards," said Jahangir Tareen, a reformist politician and successful agricultural businessman.
Food inflation totaled 64 percent in the last three years, according to Sakib Sherani, who resigned recently as the principal economic adviser at the Finance Ministry. The purchasing power of the average wage earner has declined by 20 percent since 2008, he said.
Families are taking children out of school because they cannot afford both fees and food. Others choose between medicine and dinner.
A middle-class customer in a pharmacy in Rawalpindi, the city where the powerful army has its headquarters, told the pharmacist last week to sell him only two pills of a course of 10 antibiotics because he did not have enough money for groceries.
The most popular fuel for home cooking, gas, has been severely rationed this winter. Gas supplies to power textile mills in Faisalabad were suspended this week, leaving about 400,000 workers without their daily wages, said Abdul Qayyum, a textile union official.
At the same time, joblessness has soared. The true unemployment rate was 34 percent, meaning 18 million people, mostly young, were officially seeking jobs in Pakistan, Mr. Sherani said.
Many of these jobless young men are products of religious schools, known as madrasas, run by radical clerics who favor Islamist teachings and an anti-Western creed. For the last 15 years, according to a government estimate, two million young men have passed through them, many then scooped up by the Taliban, Lashkar-e-Taiba and other militant groups.
The breadth of hard-line Islamist belief was exposed last month when an elite police guard shot a senior politician, Salman Taseer, for his opposition to the nation's blasphemy laws.
The security guard, Malik Mumtaz Hussain Qadri, has catapulted to the front row of contemporary Pakistani heroes and was hailed by lawyers, mainstream politicians and religious leaders. Rallies are being held on a weekly basis in his honor.
Well-to-do secular families who serve liquor in their big city homes nervously talk of their servants "doing a Qadri," voicing a fear that the flotilla of help that is common among the privileged will turn on their patrons.
In a sign of the anxiety among politicians about the mood on the street, the government decided Monday not to raise gas prices as scheduled. In January, to stave off the collapse of its parliamentary majority, the government similarly canceled a 9 percent fuel increase.
In combination with the failure of members of Parliament to raise taxes on themselves, the steps have done little to heal Pakistan's budget woes. In a briefing to the members, the finance minister, Abdul Hafeez Shaikh, said the fiscal deficit would reach 8.5 percent of the gross domestic product by midyear, nearly double the target set by the International Monetary Fund.
But Pakistan has become the nuclear-armed version of "too big to fail." It has been made easier for Mr. Zardari, Mr. Gilani and other politicians to balk at hard economic choices knowing that the I.M.F. and the United States -- which is now providing about $2 billion a year in assistance -- will continue to bail them out, analysts and diplomats say.
"The West looks at Pakistan with increasing horror but continues to insist that this is called the pain of evolving democracy," said Mr. Tareen, the politician and businessman.
But before democracy could take hold in Pakistan, the patronage system that passes for it will have totally plundered the country, he said.
Then, he said, the people, frustrated by the failure of representative democracy, will respond to the slogans calling for Islamic rule and the ouster of the United States. "Those forces will sweep into power," Mr. Tareen said, "and it will be as much of a surprise to us, the ruling elite, as the elite guard's murder of Salman Taseer last month."

Full text: SIMI VALLEY, Calif. -- Ronald Reagan would have turned 100 this Sunday, and nearly seven years after his death, one might think he were still alive and leading the Republican Party.
Along with the requisite speeches and academic panels, the festivities include: a Rose Parade float, a six-foot-high cake, commemorative stamps and jelly beans, a Beach Boys concert, a tribute from the Jonas Brothers and a video homage at the Super Bowl, which is also on Sunday. The memorials, including a 21-gun salute and a graveside wreath-laying by Nancy Reagan, are expected to draw hundreds of former aides and supporters.
Reagan is not the first former president to enjoy the honor of a centennial celebration, but it is hard to remember any that were quite so lavish, speaking to his enduring role in American politics. (This weekend's festivities at the Reagan Library here, the highlight of a year's worth of events around the country, will cost roughly $5 million; by contrast, the cost of Lyndon Johnson's centennial in 2008 was a mere $500,000.)
And a number of the prospective 2012 presidential candidates will be on hand to offer their praise during the revelry, among them Sarah Palin and Newt Gingrich, who has just written a book about Reagan and, in an interview, called him the "most successful president at actually achieving his specific and articulated goals."
The accolades illustrate the unusual durability -- at least among Republicans -- of the Reagan legacy, which has endured even as so many institutions have been under attack. Reagan's near-idol status in the G.O.P. is so ingrained that when potential party chairmen were asked last month to name their political hero, the moderator hastened to add "aside from President Reagan."
If the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation has any say, that qualifier will be repeated for decades.
"Our job is to promote the legacy of his words and work, which were simply incredible," said John Heubusch, the executive director of the foundation and a former Congressional aide, who said that Reagan inspired him to enter politics. "I'd go toe-to-toe to debate with anyone who said he was not a transformational president. He certainly was."
Staff members at the foundation are careful to point out that the money for the events and for the museum's $15 million renovation came entirely from private fund-raising. "President Reagan would not have wanted Congress to spend any money on this," said Stewart McLaurin, the director of the centennial events, who also went to work for Reagan in 1984.
What about the presidential Jelly Belly jelly beans? Reagan was a famous fan, so it is certainly possible that he would look kindly on spending $24.95 for the special edition Reagan Centennial box. Along with 50 flavors of jelly beans, the box comes with a copy of the Declaration of Independence, a brief history of Reagan's life and several of his quotes.
The Reaganisms include the lofty: "I can assure you that personal faith and conviction are strengthened, not weakened, in adversity." And then there's his philosophy on jelly beans: "You can tell a lot about a fella's character by whether he picks out all of one color or just grabs a handful."
Perhaps it is hardly surprising for Reagan, who was known as the Great Communicator, to be quoted so extensively.
"He's referred to all the time because he's extraordinarily quotable and inspiring, as much as Lincoln and more than anyone else in the 20th century," Mr. Gingrich said.
Mr. Gingrich is hardly the only presidential hopeful who will lavish such adoration for Reagan in the coming days. Ms. Palin is scheduled to speak at a banquet for the Young America's Foundation, a conservative group that uses the former Reagan family ranch near here as its headquarters. Gov. Rick Perry of Texas is also expected to attend the official events, as will former Vice President Dick Cheney.
The love for Reagan is not universal, of course, and liberals do not hold him in such high esteem.
"Reagan holds unique status today because the Republicans don't have anyone else," said Paul Begala, a former Clinton aide and a political strategist. "They can't lionize Eisenhower because, by today's standards, he was a liberal. They can't lionize Nixon because he was a criminal. Who have they got left?"
"He was an extraordinary president," Mr. Begala added, "but the right needed a hero, so they turned him into a hero."
Still, President Obama's aides were happy to let it be known that his vacation reading list included a biography of the 40th president by Lou Cannon.
Mr. Cannon said that the popular view of Reagan had only improved with time, although his approval ratings were higher than many other presidents when he left office.
"There's always a certain nostalgia," Mr. Cannon said. "But the reality is he really did help end the cold war. The world now ain't a walk in Central Park, but it's certainly a much safer place than when Reagan took office. And he convinced Americans to believe in themselves."
That is the sort of lesson the foundation hopes to pass on, mindful that most of today's students were not yet born when Reagan left office. This year, they distributed a Reagan-centered curriculum to more than 1,400 high schools throughout the country. The schools will also receive a special Reagan centennial coin, which organizers here hope will be used for the coin toss at Friday night football games. Once the game is done, Mr. McLaurin said, those same schools are expected to use the coin to present a student with a Reagan leadership award.
The flurry of activity is a bit bewildering to those who helped plan Johnson's centennial three years ago.
"Our goal wasn't really an extravaganza, it was something more modest," said Larry Temple, the chairman of the Lyndon Baines Johnson Foundation. "We were just trying to put a spotlight on things that might be overlooked. We were trying to do what any history should do, which is show the relevancy to today."
The Johnson people did have aspirations for a postage stamp, but they quickly realized that getting even a former president's image on the right corner of an envelope could take years. Reagan Foundation officials, on the other hand, were able to fast-track the process, in part because the Postal Service created the first Reagan stamp in 2004, shortly after his death. The newest version will be issued this month as a "forever" stamp, making it valid even when the price of postage increases. This time, it might please Reagan to know, his image will not be subject to inflation.

Full text: The nation's colleges and universities received charitable contributions of $28 billion in 2010, an increase of 0.5 percent from the previous year, according to the annual survey by the Council for Aid to Education.
Support for higher education, measured in total dollars, is at the same level now as it was in 2006, the council said. But adjusted for inflation, it was 8 percent lower last year than in 2006.
"We're still not out of the woods," said Ann E. Kaplan, director of the council's Voluntary Support of Education survey. "Charitable contributions to education are recovering very slowly."
Stanford raised $599 million from private donors last year, more than any other university. It was followed by Harvard, which raised $597 million, and Johns Hopkins University, which raised $428 million. But all three raised less in 2010 than in 2009, the survey found, as did most of the top 20 institutions.
While the survey included 996 institutions, the top 20 colleges and universities accounted for a quarter of all gifts to higher education last year.
Four of the top 20 universities -- the University of Southern California, Duke University, Indiana University and the University of California, Berkeley -- received charitable contributions in 2010 that were more than 10 percent greater than the previous year.
Over all, alumni giving and participation declined last year, while donations from companies and foundations increased modestly.
The share of alumni who contribute to their college has been declining for years, even when the economy was strong. According to the survey, alumni participation averaged 9.8 percent last year, compared with 11.9 percent in 2006 -- and the average gift was $1,080 last year, compared with $1,195 four years earlier.

Abstract: [...] Beijing's efforts to fight inflation, through higher interest rates and tighter restrictions on bank loans, could begin to slow segments of China's domestic economy slightly -- particularly the breakneck pace of investment in new factories, office buildings and apartment complexes. Since the beginning of last year, Beijing has moved several times to start clamping back down on the money in circulation, by increasing the required amounts that banks must hold in reserve, leaving them with less money to lend.

Full text: HONG KONG -- China's government, increasingly worried about soaring inflation, plans to continue tightening its money supply and will probably raise interest rates again within the month.
That is the forecast of economists and bankers with knowledge of policy makers' views, who insisted on anonymity because of the political and diplomatic sensitivity of Chinese monetary policy.
Inflation lately has caused friction in China's mighty export machine. Now, Beijing's efforts to fight inflation, through higher interest rates and tighter restrictions on bank loans, could begin to slow segments of China's domestic economy slightly -- particularly the breakneck pace of investment in new factories, office buildings and apartment complexes.
That, in turn, could weaken demand for industrial materials like steel and copper that depend heavily on Chinese purchases.
And yet, the tighter-money policies and higher interest rates could be good news for Chinese consumers, whose spending China has been counting on for its next wave of growth -- not only to help balance the country's export-dominated economy but to enable more of the nation's 1.3 billion citizens to share in its prosperity.
For one thing, a slowdown in speculative construction could slow or even temporarily reverse the long rise of Chinese real estate prices, as 15 million people a year pour into the cities.
And while much of the construction spending, and the loans that fuel it, involve state-owned companies, households in China are typically savers, not borrowers. They pay for most cars and other large purchases with cash. Even for new homes, they typically borrow half or less of the purchase price.
So far, consumers frequently hold large bank deposits that earn interest rates well below the inflation rate. Higher interest on savings accounts, if the new policies allow, would only improve consumer purchasing power.
Much of China's inflation is being fueled by the extraordinary growth in its money supply, broadly measured as so-called M2, which has soared a total of nearly 53 percent in the last two years. That is largely a result of the country's aggressive monetary and fiscal stimulus program in 2009 and early 2010, as Beijing essentially printed money in response to the global financial crisis.
Although China's economy is a little less than half that of the United States, its money supply is now one-quarter larger than America's.
Since the beginning of last year, Beijing has moved several times to start clamping back down on the money in circulation, by increasing the required amounts that banks must hold in reserve, leaving them with less money to lend. The central bank has raised this requirement seven times in the last 13 months, with four of those increases coming in quick succession since mid-November.
The bank has also been raising interest rates. The benchmark rate for one-year corporate loans is now 5.81 percent, up from 5.31 percent a year ago. The central bank has already raised rates twice since late October, and is poised to raise them again this month, the economists and bankers said.
Economists at international banks tend to agree that China needs to take even further action to limit inflation.
"We believe Beijing must act more decisively on credit tightening to stop inflation from rising too fast," said Qu Hongbin, the chief China economist at HSBC, in a research note on Monday.
China's consumer price index climbed 4.6 percent last year. But Chinese and Western economists say the index seriously underestimates inflation because of shortcomings in how it measures the introduction of new garments and other goods and because it entirely excludes the cost of owner-occupied housing. The National Bureau of Statistics in Beijing has said it is working on improving the index.
One policy change Beijing is unlikely to take soon is letting the currency, the renminbi, appreciate faster as a way to fight inflation, the economists and bankers said.
The renminbi has already been rising at an annualized rate of 5.7 percent against the dollar since China broke the currency's peg to the dollar last June. China's central bank continues to intervene heavily in currency markets to brake the renminbi's rise, but not enough to stop the renminbi from rising altogether -- as it did for almost two years before last June.
The Obama administration, arguing that an artificially low renminbi gave Chinese exporters an unfair price advantage over Western companies, pushed China hard a year ago to break the link to the dollar. But Washington has been slightly less vocal on the subject more recently. It barely came up in public comments by either side after President Hu Jintao of China's recent state visit to the White House.
Lately, Chinese and American policy makers have been looking at the so-called real effective exchange rate, which includes differences in the two countries' inflation levels. Inflation in the United States is currently running at a rate of only about 1.5 percent.
Depending on which inflation index is chosen in each country, and whether any adjustments are made for the consistent underestimates of Chinese inflation because of methodology problems, the real effective exchange rate measure shows that the renminbi is strengthening by 10 percent or more a year against the dollar.
The Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, has said that this real exchange rate is showing that Chinese exporters already face rising costs as they try to stay competitive in the United States market.
There has been some uncertainty in financial markets since Mr. Hu announced in early December that the country would pursue a "stable" monetary policy.
But the People's Bank of China, the country's central bank, has signaled in no fewer than a dozen statements since Mr. Hu's remarks that it plans to throttle back the torrents of money still sloshing through the Chinese economy. And a policy paper from the central bank this winter indicated that, in Beijing, "stable" can in fact mean "tighter."
The paper described five settings for Chinese monetary policy: easy, suitably easy, stable, suitably tight and tight.
The paper said that policy had moved from suitably easy to stable.

Full text: Major oil firms have become big spenders. Together, the top three American giants say they plan capital spending this year of about $60 billion, well above the year of peak crude prices in 2008, despite showing only tepid cash flow growth. At first blush, this looks like desperation, as Western oil companies increasingly struggle to replace crude reserves. But patient investors will find higher returns are on the way.
Investments in a host of megaprojects, along with higher prices for services and parts, have compelled Exxon Mobil, Chevron and ConocoPhillips to open their wallets ever wider. Exxon, led by its chief executive, Rex W. Tillerson, disclosed on Monday that full-year spending was up by a fifth in 2010. Collectively, spending at the triumvirate will be roughly 20 percent higher than in 2008.
In return for these investments, oil companies expect production growth of less than 2 percent a year between 2010 and 2013. And free cash flow for the three companies -- after capital outlays -- has declined by nearly a quarter, to $34 billion, from 2005. With spending gobbling so much of the spoils, the closely watched measure of return on capital deployed is under pressure. As a result, the three oil majors trade at just 11.5 times 2011 earnings, a discount to the broader equity market.
This may be the dark before the dawn, though. In the coming years, cash flow should ramp up faster than production. Huge liquefied natural gas projects, like Chevron's Gorgon in Australia, will be prolific cash generators. A shift toward fiscally friendly rich nations will also help. And cash margins on crude from the Gulf of Mexico and Canadian oil sands are fatter than energy firms have become used to.
Of course, it will take time for these to kick in. As they do, however, cash flow at oil companies could rise 6 percent a year to 2017, according to Credit Suisse estimates. In the meantime, oil chiefs would be unwise to simply wait. To get better multiples now, bolder steps are needed -- dumping less desirable assets or, better still, spinning off refineries.
The Default Bet
Betting on Treasury yields rising is one thing; trading the chance of default is another. United States credit-default swap volumes have spiked in recent weeks. The swap activity around American debt is still hardly mainstream. But unsustainable federal borrowing is tarnishing the debt market's once pristine, risk-free benchmark.
Plenty of investors are concerned about the potential impact of the Federal Reserve's monetary policies and inflationary pressures on Treasury bond yields. Unlike less liquid corporate bonds, though, there are already many very efficient ways to hedge against a rise in interest rates. Aside from possible arbitrage opportunities, what the swap market adds is the ability to bet on an actual default by the government.
Treasury-related default swap contracts worth nearly $1.4 billion changed hands in the two weeks ended Jan. 21, according to the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation -- two-and-a-half times the average activity over the previous six months. Trading is still relatively thin. But the surge in activity points to an intensifying investor perception that the possibility of a government default can no longer be completely dismissed.
The price to protect against a Treasury default has been rising, too. It has reached $51,000 a year for five years for every $10 million of debt, about the highest price in nearly a year.
That's still less even than protection against default by Germany, reflecting that it's still highly unlikely America will walk away from its debt, even temporarily. But a projected deficit of a whopping $1.5 trillion this year, a debt load held by the public that could double to $18 trillion in 10 years and talk in Congress about a possible default if lawmakers can't agree on an increase in the permitted maximum amount of debt have all made a default seem imaginable. That's part of the eventual threat to America's top credit rating recently highlighted by the rating agency Moody's Investors Service.
Debt market investors don't, as yet, have an alternative yardstick for risk-free credit. And America's obligations may yet recapture that unquestioned status. But credit-default swap activity is one sign the fallout of the financial crisis is gradually changing perceptions about America's creditworthiness -- perhaps irreparably.

Full text: In a surprise move, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has submitted his proposal to limit local property taxes to the State Senate for a vote on Monday, a tactic that seems designed to isolate Democratic lawmakers in the Assembly who have qualms about the measure.
The 74-page bill was sent to the Senate late Friday, the last possible time to allow for a Monday vote. Republicans, who narrowly control the chamber and overwhelmingly support a cap on property tax growth, welcomed the measure, saying they would seek action immediately.
"New Yorkers need and deserve relief from high property taxes, and the Senate Republicans are working with the governor and others to put a cap in place as soon as possible," said Scott Reif, a spokesman for the Senate Republicans. "We expect to take up and pass Governor Cuomo's property tax cap program bill tomorrow."
The bill is expected to draw bipartisan support. Senate Democrats "passed the property tax cap twice last year and are ready to pass the governor's bill now," said their spokesman, Austin Shafran.
But Assembly Democrats, who control that chamber and who said they had had only preliminary talks with Mr. Cuomo about the cap, were taken by surprise and did not see the bill until Saturday, a day on which the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, an Orthodox Jew, observes the Sabbath.
Mr. Cuomo did not warn Assembly leaders that the bill was coming, officials said, despite Mr. Silver's pledge to work with Mr. Cuomo to pass a cap, the new governor's top policy priority.
While Senate Republicans had signaled that they would hold a vote on a property tax cap this week, many lawmakers had expected Mr. Cuomo to include a version of a cap as part of his executive budget on Tuesday.
"The speaker stated at the State of the State that the Assembly is committed to passing a property tax cap bill," said Sisa Moyo, a spokeswoman for Mr. Silver. "We look forward to working with the governor and our colleagues in the Senate on this issue in the upcoming budget."
Teachers' union officials said the measure appeared to be somewhat stronger than Mr. Cuomo's campaign proposal, which would cap local tax increases at 2 percent or the rate of inflation, whichever was lower. As written, they said, the bill could lead to zero-growth tax rates for many school districts.
"All along, we've been saying that we would work with the governor's proposal to try to get to a place that was fair to education," said Richard C. Iannuzzi, the president of New York State United Teachers. "This bill, as we're reading it, moves in the opposite direction and is going to make achieving something fair more difficult."
"When you do a one-house bill," he added, "it is flexing muscle in the old style of Albany, which is everything that Governor Cuomo opposes and we oppose as well."
Under the proposal, school districts would hold a vote on their tax levy each year, instead of their overall budget. If a levy failed to pass twice, districts would be locked into assuming the same levy as the year before.
The bill did not include any proposal for reducing costs or liberating municipalities and school districts from state mandates, elements that even some supporters said were critical to ensuring that a cap did not bankrupt local governments.
The significance of the expected Senate vote on Monday may ultimately be more symbolic than practical. Assembly lawmakers are unlikely to approve the bill as written, and Mr. Cuomo is likely to accept at least some concessions to secure final passage.
Aides to Mr. Cuomo said the Senate and the Assembly have had a draft of the bill since the middle of December. They also suggested that the new legislation simply turned Mr. Cuomo's campaign proposal into a proper bill -- which the governor has been promising since the day he took office.
For his first program bill, Mr. Cuomo certainly managed to avoid attracting attention. Some lawmakers in the Assembly learned of the bill only when called by a reporter on Sunday night.
Upon learning of the bill's introduction, Assemblyman Rory I. Lancman, a Democrat of Queens, said, "Every conversation has to start somewhere, and I guess the conversation is starting."

Full text: On Wall Street, it is what is known as an exogenous event -- a sudden political or economic jolt that cannot be predicted or modeled but sends shockwaves rippling through global markets.
Investors have largely shrugged off several of these unexpected developments recently, including the sovereign debt crisis in Europe, but the situation in Egypt has the potential to cause more widespread uncertainty, especially if oil and other commodities keep surging or the unrest spreads to more countries in the Middle East.
While Egypt's banks and stock market were closed because of the protests there, other Middle Eastern markets declined in trading Sunday, with shares falling by 4.3 percent in Dubai, 3.7 percent in Abu Dhabi and 2.9 percent in Qatar.
By early Monday morning, Asian markets were also trending lower, with Japan's Nikkei index falling 1.5 percent, while in South Korea, the Kospi index slid 1.4 percent.
Last week, the Dow Jones industrial average nearly surpassed the closely watched 12,000 level, but fell 166 points in late trading Friday as the protests in Egypt intensified and oil prices jumped 3.7 percent to $89.34.
With the United States economy seeming to gain a foothold only recently -- government data released Friday showed the economy grew by 3.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2010 -- a sustained increase in oil prices could choke growth, analysts said. It could also undermine the more general optimism that lifted the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index by 1.5 percent in January, after a 12.8 percent jump in 2010.
"A one-dollar, one-day increase in a barrel of oil takes $12 million out of the U.S. economy," said Jason S. Grumet, president of the Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington research group. "If tensions in the Mideast cause oil prices to rise by $5 for even just three months, over $5 billion dollars will leave the U.S. economy. Obviously, this is not a strategy for creating new jobs."
In early electronic trading on the Nymex oil futures market Sunday night, prices edged higher to $90.23 a barrel.
Until now, the stock market in the United States has defied several outside threats, including the rising risk of food inflation, interest rate increases in China, and sovereign debt troubles in Europe, said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist of Standard & Poor's Equity Research.
"But as is usually the case, a boxer never gets knocked out by a punch he's looking for," he said. "This could be what triggers the decline. Geopolitical events are very, very hard to model."
Egypt is not an oil exporter, nor is its stock market a regional heavyweight. As the home of the Suez Canal and the nearby Sumed pipeline, however, it is one of a handful of spots classified as World Oil Transit Chokepoints by the Energy Department, and events there can have an outsize impact on global energy prices.
The 141-year-old canal is just 1,000 feet wide at its narrowest, and it cannot handle supertankers, forcing shippers to rely on the pipeline or smaller vessels to move the crude.
Roughly 2.9 millions barrels of oil a day, 2.6 percent of global production, passed through the canal and the pipeline in 2009, the Energy Department said.
As a percentage of world oil demand, that may not sound like much, said William H. Brown III, a former Wall Street energy analyst who consults for hedge funds and financial institutions.
"But prices are determined at the margin and that's a lot of oil in markets these days," said Mr. Brown, who estimates global spare production capacity at 2.5 million barrels, the bulk of it in Saudi Arabia.
While prices are set globally, the immediate impact of any interruption would be felt primarily in Europe, which relies heavily on jet fuel, heating oil and other distillates refined in the Middle East and shipped via the canal and pipeline. Israel is also a major importer of Egyptian natural gas under a pact that dates to the 1978 Camp David accords.
Egypt is a major player in the global grain market, importing more wheat than any other country. Some analysts have speculated that Egypt and other Middle Eastern countries might increase grain purchases to placate angry consumers, which could eventually push wheat prices higher.
Given the confrontations with authorities in Cairo, Alexandria and other cities, many analysts expect oil prices, and global markets, to remain volatile in the coming days, even as the opposition in Egypt rallies around Mohamed ElBaradei.
"I would expect regional markets to remain very unsettled because we don't look any closer to a political resolution than we did on Friday," said Ann Wyman, head of emerging markets research in Europe for Nomura. "Instability in the Middle East makes global markets uncomfortable. We've entered a new and unpredictable phase of transitioning governments in the Middle East."
Still, a few investors are looking for opportunities in the Middle East and Egypt itself despite the declines there and the expected instability. Egyptian stocks are inexpensive compared with shares in other markets, said David Marcus, chief investment officer of Evermore Global Advisors. "This is one of the oldest economies on earth."
"We have to start doing our homework," he added, noting that another troubled Mediterranean bourse, in Athens, has rallied sharply this year, after Greece's near-default in 2010. "Egypt is pulling down the region because people panic and don't ask questions. That makes us much more interested."

Full text: HONG KONG -- Inflation is starting to slow China's mighty export machine, as buyers from Western multinational companies balk at higher prices and have cut back their planned spring shipments across the Pacific.
Markups of 20 to 50 percent on products like leather shoes and polo shirts have sent Western buyers scrambling for alternate suppliers. But from Vietnam to India, few low-wage developing countries can match China's manufacturing might -- and no country offers refuge from high global commodity prices.
Already, the slowdown in American orders has forced some container shipping lines to cancel up to a quarter of their trips to the United States this spring from Hong Kong and other Chinese ports.
The trend, if continued, could ease tensions by beginning to limit America's huge trade deficit with China. Those tensions were an undercurrent during Chinese President Hu Jintao's recent Washington talks with President Obama.
Manufacturers and distributors across a range of industries say the likely result of the export slowdown is higher prices for American shoppers in the coming months, and possibly brief shortages of some products if Western retailers delay purchases too long while haggling over prices.
China exports more than $4 of goods to the United States for each $1 it imports from America, creating a trade surplus of about $275 billion. The higher Chinese prices will tend to show up mainly in products like inexpensive clothing and other commodity goods in which labor and raw materials represent a bigger part of the final value -- rather than in sophisticated electronics like Apple iPads, in which Chinese assembly is only a small fraction of the cost.
Of course, the slowdown in the volume of imports could also prove temporary, if American consumers accept higher prices and Western corporate buyers end up renewing contracts at much higher cost. In the meantime, if the average price for each imported product rises faster than the volume of shipments falls, China's surplus with the United States could continue increasing temporarily.
But whatever the eventual impact on trade, Chinese inflation might also reduce Washington's pressure on Beijing over its currency, the renminbi. For more than a year, the Obama administration has been pushing China to let the renminbi rise in value against the dollar.
China's intervention in the currency market has kept its currency artificially low. But that flood of money has also driven inflation, giving Beijing an incentive to let the renminbi move higher. Indeed, the renminbi has increased 3.6 percent against the dollar since last June.
The Obama administration is starting to suggest that the currency problem could gradually solve itself if Chinese prices rise so fast that American goods become more competitive.
The first signs of a potential slowdown in Chinese exports have shown up in shipping. As factories closed on Friday across much of China in preparation for weeklong Chinese New Year celebrations, ports in Hong Kong and elsewhere along the coast were working long hours to meet last-minute shipments.
But the annual pre-New Year rush has been nothing like that of recent years, causing shipping lines to reverse rate increases and cancel sailings they introduced last summer as the American economy improved. This winter, the scurrying started only two weeks before the holidays, instead of the usual four weeks, according to shipping executives. That is because many Chinese factories simply cut back production this month as their Western customers began resisting steep price increases.
China's inflation is running 5 percent at the consumer level, according to official measures. But Chinese and Western economists describe these measures as based on flawed, outdated techniques and say the real figure may be up to twice as high.
In contrast, the annual inflation rate in the United States is low by historical standards -- about 1.5 percent currently.
China imposed price controls on food in mid-November to limit inflation. But Chinese state media began warning the public on Wednesday that those controls might be ineffective, as a drought in northern China has damaged the winter wheat crop and frost has spoiled part of the vegetable harvest in the south.
China's $6 trillion economy used to be heavily dependent on exports for growth. Exports still account for about one-fifth of the economy, after excluding goods that are merely imported to China for final assembly and then re-exported. But China's economy has grown powerfully for the last two years mainly on the strength of investment-led domestic demand. That demand, partly fed by low-interest lending by state-owned banks, is another factor in China's inflation.
Cities and provinces across China have tried to cushion inflation's effect on consumers by sharply raising minimum wages. Guangdong Province, the export heartland of light industry next to Hong Kong, announced two weeks ago that its cities were raising their minimum wages by an average of 18.6 percent, effective March 1.
That follows a similar increase that took effect in Guangdong around eight months ago. Many other provinces and cities have also sharply raised minimum wages recently.
The wage increases are also driven by a growing scarcity of factory workers. The number of Chinese in their 20s and early 30s, the traditional age bracket for factory labor, is slowly shrinking because of the introduction of the "one child system" a generation ago. And a rapidly expanding university system has produced waves of graduates with no interest in factory work.
Some companies have responded by moving factories deeper into China's interior, said Stanley Lau, the deputy chairman of the Federation of Hong Kong Industries, which represents exporters employing 10 million mainland Chinese workers. But inland wages are starting to catch up with coastal pay rates, Mr. Lau said, while higher transportation costs frequently offset the wage savings from moving to the interior.
Coach, the American company that is one of the largest marketers of luxury handbags and other accessories, announced on Tuesday that it planned to reduce its reliance on China to less than half of its products, from more than 80 percent now. It will shift output to Vietnam and India, particularly for smaller, more labor-intensive leather goods.
But Mike Devine, the company's executive vice president and chief financial officer, said that it would take four years to carry out the shift.
Trying to move production elsewhere, some retailers are finding many factories are already fully booked: Vietnam and Thailand each have populations smaller than some Chinese provinces, while Cambodia and Laos have smaller populations than some Chinese cities.
Many manufacturers foresee further labor shortages looming in China that will push wages even higher. They are responding with plans to upgrade their factory equipment and product designs, which could turn them into more direct competitors with high-end manufacturers in Europe and the United States.

Abstract: The Federal Reserve's preferred measure, which excludes volatile energy and food prices, is now running below half a percent at an annual rate, far below the informal target of 2 percent. First of all, inflation in China is China's problem, not ours.

Full text: Last Saturday, reported The Financial Times, some of the world's most powerful financial executives were going to hold a private meeting with finance ministers in Davos, the site of the World Economic Forum. The principal demand of the executives, the newspaper suggested, would be that governments "stop banker-bashing." Apparently bailing bankers out after they precipitated the worst slump since the Great Depression isn't enough -- politicians have to stop hurting their feelings, too.
But the bankers also had a more substantive demand: they want higher interest rates, despite the persistence of very high unemployment in the United States and Europe, because they say that low rates are feeding inflation. And what worries me is the possibility that policy makers might actually take their advice.
To understand the issues, you need to know that we're in the midst of what the International Monetary Fund calls a "two speed" recovery, in which some countries are speeding ahead, but others -- including the United States -- have yet to get out of first gear.
The U.S. economy fell into recession at the end of 2007; the rest of the world followed a few months later. And advanced nations -- the United States, Europe, Japan -- have barely begun to recover. It's true that these economies have been growing since the summer of 2009, but the growth has been too slow to produce large numbers of jobs. To raise interest rates under these conditions would be to undermine any chance of doing better; it would mean, in effect, accepting mass unemployment as a permanent fact of life.
What about inflation? High unemployment has kept a lid on the measures of inflation that usually guide policy. The Federal Reserve's preferred measure, which excludes volatile energy and food prices, is now running below half a percent at an annual rate, far below the informal target of 2 percent.
But food and energy prices -- and commodity prices in general -- have, of course, been rising lately. Corn and wheat prices rose around 50 percent last year; copper, cotton and rubber prices have been setting new records. What's that about?
The answer, mainly, is growth in emerging markets. While recovery in advanced nations has been sluggish, developing countries -- China in particular -- have come roaring back from the 2008 slump. This has created inflation pressures within many of these countries; it has also led to sharply rising global demand for raw materials. Bad weather -- especially an unprecedented heat wave in the former Soviet Union, which led to a sharp fall in world wheat production -- has also played a role in driving up food prices.
The question is, what bearing should all of this have on policy at the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank?
First of all, inflation in China is China's problem, not ours. It's true that right now China's currency is pegged to the dollar. But that's China's choice; if China doesn't like U.S. monetary policy, it's free to let its currency rise. Neither China nor anyone else has the right to demand that America strangle its nascent economic recovery just because Chinese exporters want to keep the renminbi undervalued.
What about commodity prices? The Fed normally focuses on "core" inflation, which excludes food and energy, rather than "headline" inflation, because experience shows that while some prices fluctuate widely from month to month, others have a lot of inertia -- and it's the ones with inertia you want to worry about, because once either inflation or deflation gets built into these prices, it's hard to get rid of.
And this focus has served the Fed well in the past. In particular, the Fed was right not to raise rates in 2007-8, when commodity prices soared -- briefly pushing headline inflation above 5 percent -- only to plunge right back to earth. It's hard to see why the Fed should behave differently this time, with inflation nowhere near as high as it was during the last commodity boom.
So why the demand for higher rates? Well, bankers have a long history of getting fixated on commodity prices. Traditionally, that meant insisting that any rise in the price of gold would mean the end of Western civilization. These days it means demanding that interest rates be raised because the prices of copper, rubber, cotton and tin have gone up, even though underlying inflation is on the decline.
Ben Bernanke clearly understands that raising rates now would be a huge mistake. But Jean-Claude Trichet, his European counterpart, is making hawkish noises -- and both the Fed and the European Central Bank are under a lot of external pressure to do the wrong thing.
They need to resist this pressure. Yes, commodity prices are up -- but that's no reason to perpetuate mass unemployment. To paraphrase William Jennings Bryan, we must not crucify our economies upon a cross of rubber.

Full text: Ross Ramsey, the managing editor of The Texas Tribune, writes a regular column.
Abortion politics is back on center stage in Texas, with Gov. Rick Perry putting legislation that failed twice in the last four years on his list of top priorities for the Legislature.
It's up there with voter photo ID, state support for a balanced federal budget amendment to the United States Constitution, eminent domain and a ban on sanctuary cities.
Why?
Timing is one reason -- it's harder for opponents to stop something at the start of a session. And there's an advantage to taking care of single-subject bills before the big stuff -- like the $15 billion to $27 billion budget shortfall and redistricting -- eats up the legislative bandwidth.
But there's more to this than timing. The governor is setting the agenda, using the early part of the session to serve up red meat to conservatives -- feeding the base. As a side benefit, he's also crowding out some of the headlines about the dire finances.
"We can't afford to give up the good fight until the day Roe v. Wade is nothing but a shameful footnote in our nation's history books," Mr. Perry said last weekend at an anti-abortion rally at the Capitol, when he announced that an abortion/ultrasound bill would go on the "emergency items" agenda.
Texas lawmakers can't consider legislation during the first 60 days of a session unless the governor declares that legislation an emergency. (Ignore the standard definition of that word: there is no standard of urgency or need required, simply the governor's say-so.)
The bill would require doctors to perform an ultrasound on a pregnant woman and display the images where she can see them shortly before an abortion is done. In addition, doctors would be required to amplify the fetal heartbeats so the pregnant woman could hear them.
Politicians often design their strategies around their most recent fights.
Two years ago, supporters of the legislation requiring voters to present photo IDs waited until the end of the session to bring it up for consideration. Democrats in the House killed the legislation by slowing consideration of everything that was in line in front of the voter ID bill, which pushed it past the deadline, and it never came to a vote.
This time, Mr. Perry put the legislation on the emergency list, and the Senate passed it Wednesday night and sent it to the House.
What's generally known in Austin as the "sonogram bill" has a similar history. This is the third time the legislation has been proposed. In 2007, it was passed by the Senate and was up for consideration at the end of the session in the House when the legislative clock ran out. In 2009, it failed when time expired.
Eminent-domain legislation died on the same 2009 House calendar, stuck in the queue as the deadline passed after days of protracted debate over mostly uncontested legislation -- a tactic called chubbing -- that braked legislative work to a near halt.
It should come as no surprise that the Republicans are in a hurry this time. Opponents can talk for weeks, and there will still be time to pass the bills.
Two years ago, the list of emergency items was boring by comparison: hurricane response, windstorm insurance reform, state school improvement and criminal justice financing. Mr. Perry put property-tax relief for elderly homeowners on the 2007 list in order to correct an oversight from a 2006 tax bill.
The five issues he picked for this session are all conservative candy. They'll get Republican lawmakers accustomed to party-line votes right away. And bringing the list in early gives conservative lawmakers a chance to work before opponents can use late-session parliamentary tricks to plug the pipeline.
Mr. Perry's critics are riled up, scratching at him for not including on his list a state budget that's dripping in red ink. Redistricting can't really get going until the detailed census numbers are available, weeks from now. There's no disagreement, however, that the state is short of what it needs to keep doing the things it's doing. The fight there has been over whether it's apocalyptic or just really horrible.
The proposals from the House and the Senate each cut around one dollar in six from the current budget and ignore growth in population and inflation. Mr. Perry and others argue that lawmakers are hard at work on that and couldn't finish their work in the first 60 days of the session even if they wanted to. It's too hard.
So it's not an emergency.

Abstract: Money and Business/Financial Desk SINCE the financial crisis, bad news for the bond market has generally meant trouble for stocks.

Full text: SINCE the financial crisis, bad news for the bond market has generally meant trouble for stocks.
That's because equity investors have looked to corporate and foreign bonds to gauge the health of the global economy. Last spring, for example, when the debt crisis in Europe erupted -- casting doubt on an economic recovery -- the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index sank more than 16 percent.
But in recent weeks, this relationship appears to have broken off.
Stocks have been rallying in the face of declines in bonds, which have been prompted in part by growing concerns surrounding the finances of local and state governments. Since the start of December, municipal, foreign and long-term Treasury bond funds have lost value, on average. And investors have yanked nearly $18 billion from their fixed-income portfolios, according to the Investment Company Institute. Yet, during that same stretch, the S.& P. 500 has risen more than 8 percent.
Why are these markets heading in different directions? It could be a sign that stock investors have grown confident enough in the health of the economy to stop taking their cues from the fixed-income market.
Consumer confidence is relatively high, and economists have started to ratchet up their expectations for economic growth. The economic forecasting firm IHS Global Insight, for example, now says it believes that gross domestic product in the United States will jump 3.2 percent this year over last year. That's up significantly from the firm's previous estimate of 2.4-percent.
"It's hard not to notice that the economy is improving and companies are reporting strong earnings," said Russel Kinnel, director of mutual fund research at Morningstar in Chicago.
Of course, there's another -- and more direct -- explanation for why stocks have lately been feeding off the bad news for bonds.
"The money that's been leaving bonds has to go somewhere," said Mark D. Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia.
And the best guess is that it's been heading into stocks. Indeed, since Dec. 1, nearly $15 billion of net new money has flowed into stock mutual funds -- a stark contrast to the net redemptions that stock portfolios had been experiencing since the start of the 2008.
There's no way to say with certainty that the money leaving bonds is being redirected into equities. But one indication, Mr. Luschini said, is the performance of big blue-chip stocks.
"If investors are going to extend out on the risk branch, what's their next step after bonds?" he asked. "Stocks. But which type? It will probably be blue-chip, quality names that pay dividends and offer conservative investors some comfort."
Sure enough, large-capitalization shares have been the best-performing part of the domestic stock market of late. The Dow Jones industrial average, representing shares of 30 of the country's biggest companies, has climbed 2.1 percent since the start of the year. At the same time, the Russell 2000 small-stock index has fallen 1.1 percent.
Concerns about the health of municipal finances are just one factor that's been driving money out of bonds.
In taxable bonds, it's not the economic health of issuers that's troubling investors. Instead, it's the possibility of rising interest rates and a jump in inflation -- both signs of an improving economy -- that have been making investors jittery.
"They think all of the money that was printed to stimulate the economy will be inflationary, and that's bad for corporate bonds," said Marilyn Cohen, president of Envision Capital Management, a fixed-income manager based in Los Angeles. Bond investors are particularly sensitive to inflation, which threatens to eat away at a large chunk of the modest gains that such investors have historically enjoyed.
Inflation could ultimately be bad for stocks, too, but Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at S.& P., notes that equities have historically thrived in periods of rising prices. "Some inflation is actually preferred," he said, so long as it does not grow faster than around 4 percent annually.
Stock investors don't necessarily think that the economy is completely out of the woods.
Chris Leavy, chief investment officer at BlackRock's actively managed equity fund group, said that any further negative news about the credit health of European governments or municipal borrowers later this year could threaten confidence in the stock market.
It all depends on how serious the credit problems are, Mr. Leavy said.
Still, since the worst days of the financial crisis, he said, "the stock market is much better prepared to handle bad news."

Abstract: Since my birth in 1962, it seems to me, there have not been comparable improvements. Many of the Internet's gains are fun -- games, chat rooms, Twitter streams -- rather than vast sources of revenue, and when there have been measurable monetary gains, they often have been concentrated among a small number of company founders, as with, say, Facebook.

Full text: MY grandmother, who was born in 1905, spoke often about the immense changes she had seen, including the widespread adoption of electricity, the automobile, flush toilets, antibiotics and convenient household appliances. Since my birth in 1962, it seems to me, there have not been comparable improvements.
Of course, the personal computer and its cousin, the smartphone, have brought about some big changes. And many goods and services are now more plentiful and of better quality. But compared with what my grandmother witnessed, the basic accouterments of life have remained broadly the same.
The income numbers for Americans reflect this slowdown in growth. From 1947 to 1973 -- a period of just 26 years -- inflation-adjusted median income in the United States more than doubled. But in the 31 years from 1973 to 2004, it rose only 22 percent. And, over the last decade, it actually declined.
Most well-off countries have experienced income growth slowdowns since the early 1970s, so it would seem that a single cause is transcending national borders: the reaching of a technological plateau. The numbers suggest that for almost 40 years, we've had near-universal dissemination of the major innovations stemming from the Industrial Revolution, many of which combined efficient machines with potent fossil fuels. Today, no huge improvement for the automobile or airplane is in sight, and the major struggle is to limit their pollution, not to vastly improve their capabilities.
Although America produces plenty of innovations, most are not geared toward significantly raising the average standard of living. It seems that we are coming up with ideas that benefit relatively small numbers of people, compared with the broad-based advances of earlier decades, when the modern world was put into place. If pre-1973 growth rates had continued, for example, median family income in the United States would now be more than $90,000, as opposed to its current range of around $50,000.
Will the Internet usher in a new economic growth explosion? Quite possibly, but it hasn't delivered very good macroeconomic performance over the last decade. Many of the Internet's gains are fun -- games, chat rooms, Twitter streams -- rather than vast sources of revenue, and when there have been measurable monetary gains, they often have been concentrated among a small number of company founders, as with, say, Facebook. As for users, the Internet has benefited the well-educated and the curious to a disproportionate degree, but apparently not enough to bolster median income.
Beyond the income slowdown, there is a further worry: an increasing share of the economy consists of education and health care. That trend is not necessarily bad, but in these two areas, results are often hard to measure. If health care costs rise 6 percent in a year, for example, that counts as higher G.D.P., but how much is our health actually improving? It's an open question. America spends more on health care than other countries, but those expenditures don't seem to produce uniformly superior results. And while there have certainly been gains in medical treatment, we may be overvaluing them. In education, we are spending more each year, but test scores have stagnated for decades, graduation rates are down and America's worst schools are disasters.
There is an even broader problem. When it comes to measuring national income, we're generally valuing expenditures at cost, rather than tracking productivity in terms of results. In other words, our statistics may be deceiving us -- by accepting, say, our health care and educational expenditures at face value. This theme has been emphasized by the PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel in his public talks and by the economist Michael Mandel in his writings. And I've stressed it in a recent e-book, "The Great Stagnation."
Sooner or later, new technological revolutions will occur, perhaps in the biosciences, through genome sequencing, or in energy production, through viable solar power, for example. But these transformations won't come overnight, and we'll have to make do in the meantime. Instead of facing up to this scarcity, politicians promote tax cuts and income redistribution policies to benefit favored constituencies. Yet these are one-off adjustments and, over time, they cannot undo the slower rate of growth in average living standards.
It's unclear whether Americans have the temperament to make a smooth transition to a more stagnant economy. After all, we've long thought of our country as the land of unlimited opportunity. In practice, this optimism has meant that we continue to increase government spending, whether or not we can afford it.
In the narrow sense, the solution to the stagnation of median income will not be a political one. And one of the hardest points to grasp about this quandary is that no one in particular is to blame. Scientific progress has never proceeded on an even, predictable basis, even though for part of the 20th century it seemed that it might.
Science should be encouraged with subsidies for basic research, as well as private charity, educational reform, a business culture geared toward commercializing inventions, and greater public appreciation for the scientific endeavor. A lighter legal and regulatory hand could ease the path of future innovations.
NONETHELESS, advancing discovery is not a goal to be reached by the mere application of will. Precisely because there is no obvious villain and no simple fix, and many complex factors behind success, science as a general topic doesn't play a big role in American political discourse. When it comes to understanding our macroeconomic predicament, we often seem to be missing the point.
Until science has a greater impact again on average daily living standards, the political problem will be in learning to live within our means. Because neither major party seems to support a plausible path to fiscal balance, or to acknowledge how little control politicians actually have over future income growth, we unscientifically keep living in an age of denial.

U.S. Economic Growth Bounces Back to Rate Seen Before Recession

Full text: With a little more money in their wallets and a little less fear in their hearts, American consumers helped pull the economy up by its bootstraps in the final months of last year.
The gross domestic product, a broad measure of the goods and services produced in the country, grew at an annual rate of 3.2 percent in the fourth quarter, up from 2.6 percent in the previous period, according to a Commerce Department report released Friday.
Because of this slightly speedier expansion, the nation's overall economic output has finally matched its peak before the recession. Still, given the millions of jobless American workers, the economy has fallen far short of what it could be if it were healthy, economists said.
"Things are better, but they're not anywhere near where they need to be to make major inroads into unemployment," said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics.
Thanks to modestly higher paychecks and swelled investment portfolios, Americans appeared more comfortable buying again and stashing away a little less in savings.
Consumer spending grew at an annual rate of 4.4 percent in the October-December period, its quickest pace in nearly five years and almost double the growth rate from the previous quarter.
The payroll tax cut and the extension of the Bush-era tax cuts, both passed in December, are expected to further buoy consumer spending, which many economists predict will grow at an annual pace of about 3 or 3.5 percent this year.
The shrinking trade deficit also helped the economy regain some momentum in the final months of the year.
Economic growth, after a surge in late 2009, began to sputter in the spring of last year. The slowdown was largely the result of rocketing growth in imports, which are subtracted from the government's calculations of gross domestic product. In the fourth quarter, however, a combination of rising exports and shrinking imports helped the economy expand at a faster pace. "In the middle of last year, imports showed the biggest drag on G.D.P. growth in more than 60 years," said Dean Maki, chief United States economist at Barclays Capital. "That kind of rise in imports just wasn't sustainable."
Businesses also increased their spending on equipment and software as the year concluded, though not quite at the double-digit growth rates shown earlier in the year. Economists are hoping that these types of investments -- and a replenishing of inventories, which ran low at the end of the last quarter -- will soon be matched by investments in new workers as well.
"Firms have the cash to hire," said Augustine Faucher, director of macroeconomics at Moody's Analytics. "They just need the confidence to do so, and that could develop quickly."
The overall economic growth rate came in slightly below analysts' expectations, which was an annual pace of 3.5 percent in the fourth quarter. The preliminary number released by the Commerce Department on Friday was about apace with forecasts for the full year. The Congressional Budget Officeforecast that the economy would grow 3.1 percent in 2011, a figure echoed by many Wall Street analysts.
While that rate would be faster than last year's, it is still probably not robust enough to make a significant dent in the unemployment rate, which stood at 9.4 percent in December. In the couple of years before the recession, which began in December 2007, the American jobless rate was less than half that level.
"We're still very much below the output growth rate needed to absorb the slack in labor market," said Prajakta Bhide, a research analyst for the United States economy at Roubini Global Economics. "We're expecting to end the year with an unemployment rate of 9 percent."
The Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, speaking in an interview Friday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, said that "brutal" job cuts early in the recession "consign us to a tragically more moderate reduction in unemployment as the economy recovers." But he said he had growing confidence that the United States economy would continue to expand.
The International Monetary Fund has predicted that other rich countries, like those in the euro zone, will have modest growth in the coming year, while China will surge ahead with growth nearing 10 percent. Though the rapid-fire growth in emerging markets may push the prices of food and energy higher, these developing countries could help increase global growth by encouraging more trade.
"There are concerns here that China is managing its exchange rate, and that does limit the upside for U.S. exporters," said Paul Ashworth, a senior United States economist at Capital Economics. "But in general, stronger growth in developing countries, as long as it's sustainable and not the result of a credit boom that could come crashing down, should benefit developed countries like the United States as well."

Bet on Gold Nets Paulson $5 Billion

Author: AZAM AHMED and JULIE CRESWELL

Publication info: New York Times , Late Edition (East Coast); New York, N.Y. [New York, N.Y]29 Jan 2011: B.1.

Abstract: While Mr. Paulson's firm oversees about $36 billion of assets in a range of hedge funds, the bulk of his personal fortune is invested in his funds that buy securities linked to the price of gold.

Full text: John A. Paulson made $4 billion betting against newfangled mortgage investments. But he made even more betting on an old-fashioned investment: gold.
Mr. Paulson, a hedge fund manager who sprang to fame when the housing market collapsed, personally made about $5 billion in 2010, according to two investors in his company.
How? Mr. Paulson bought gold -- lots of it. His firm, Paulson & Company, owns securities that represent the rough equivalent of 96 metric tons of the metal.
It is an outsize wager by almost any standard. Mr. Paulson's firm does not actually own all that gold. But if it did, it would be sitting atop more gold than the Australian government. Mr. Paulson himself would be holding more gold than Bulgaria.
Mr. Paulson is known for betting big. His payday for last year exceeds the $4 billion he made for 2007. He became one of the most celebrated hedge fund managers in the business after his firm shorted subprime investments.
The 2010 income, which was first reported by The Wall Street Journal, was the culmination of a remarkable comeback for Mr. Paulson last year.
While Mr. Paulson's firm oversees about $36 billion of assets in a range of hedge funds, the bulk of his personal fortune is invested in his funds that buy securities linked to the price of gold. Gold jumped almost 30 percent in 2010. So far this year, however, it has fallen almost 6 percent.
While some other hedge fund stars turned in strong performances last year -- David Tepper of Appaloosa Management, Daniel Loeb of Third Point and William A. Ackman of Pershing Square, for instance -- Mr. Paulson's payday most likely dwarfed theirs, as he oversees funds that are substantially bigger.
Throughout much of last year, Mr. Paulson's funds lagged the market. Amid questions about whether the funds had become too big to beat the markets or whether Mr. Paulson had lost his touch, some investors asked for their money back midyear.
But those who stayed were rewarded. In the final quarter of the year, many of Mr. Paulson's core stock holdings rose substantially. His two largest funds, with a combined $18 billion in assets, the Advantage and Advantage Plus fund, were up 11.1 percent and 17.6 percent by the end of the year. (The difference between the two funds is that the Advantage Plus fund uses leverage, or borrowed money, to increase its returns.)
The average hedge fund gained a little more than 10.5 percent in 2010, a lukewarm year for many hedge fund managers, according to a composite index tracked by Hedge Fund Research of Chicago. Many investors would have achieved bigger gains by putting their money in an index that tracked the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which was up about 15 percent last year, including dividends.
But Mr. Paulson's personal payday was probably greater than that of many of his investors. The $5 billion he earned was almost twice the entire payroll of all Major League Baseball teams. While part of that came from his firm's 20 percent cut of his funds' profits -- a typical "performance fee" in the industry -- the bulk of his gains came from his own money he has in his funds.
Investors say Mr. Paulson has about $10 billion of his own money invested with the funds and that the vast majority of his money is invested in a special gold-share class he created a few years ago that is invested alongside his other portfolios.
So, while the Paulson Advantage fund was up 11.1 percent last year, the gold class shares of that portfolio surged 30.8 percent, according to investors in the fund, who spoke on the condition they not be named so as not to endanger their professional relationship with Mr. Paulson.
Mr. Paulson invested heavily in gold on the belief that the dollar would lose value in the coming years. His gold investments are primarily done via a gold exchange-traded fund, SPDR Gold Shares.
One of the largest E.T.F.'s in the world, SPDR Gold Shares is a trust that holds nearly 1,230 metric tons of gold bars in the vaults of HSBC bank in London.
The gold fund has attracted a lot of big investors who are looking for a hedge against inflation. George Soros and Eric Mindich of Eton Park both held substantial stakes in the gold shares trust, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
"It's massively popular. It's been growing by leaps and bounds ever since the financial crisis," said Scott Burns, director of E.T.F. research at the research firm Morningstar.
Investors in the special gold shares class do not pay an additional management fee for their stake in the gold funds, but they do give Mr. Paulson 20 percent of any profits. Only about one-third of his total investors are in the gold-shares class, many choosing instead to invest directly in the gold fund and keep all of their gains.

Full text: The budget shortfalls gripping many states have rattled the $3 trillion municipal bond market. Yet even with unfunded pensions added, their debt burdens are dwarfed by those of the federal government. There are big structural differences, but the evidence suggests investors should worry less about munis and more about Treasuries.
That's not to say states like Illinois and California don't face cash squeezes, though many smaller municipal borrowers appear to be in much worse shape. But on the numbers, Washington has the most work to do, and in areas President Obama avoided in his State of the Union address this week.
Many of the 50 states have unfunded pension liabilities bigger than their straight long-term debt loads when discounted back to a single figure, according to a report from Moody's Investors Service. Some worst cases: In Hawaii, Mississippi and Connecticut, the combined total adds up to more than 15 percent of each state's gross domestic product. In Oregon, Colorado and Illinois, it's three times revenue, and in Connecticut, Hawaii and Massachusetts, it's more than $8,000 a person.
But consider the federal situation -- excluding, as with the state numbers, health care obligations. To the $9 trillion of debt at the end of the 2010 fiscal year, by the Congressional Budget Office's numbers, add the $5.4 trillion of unfunded Social Security obligations through 2084 as calculated by the trustees of the related funds. Combined, that's nearly 100 percent of American G.D.P. in 2010, or almost seven times federal revenue, according to the C.B.O., and just shy of $50,000 for every American.
Washington can print money, has greater power over taxation and spending than states, and in theory it can modify Social Security much more easily than states can adjust protected pension entitlements. Moreover, the pension reporting of states is fuzzy and may understate the reality. And of course, taxpayers and retirees will ultimately end up covering state and federal obligations alike.
But with nearly $5 trillion more debt expected to be issued by the federal government in the coming five years, it could be time to avoid Uncle Sam's debt and buy that of the states.
Japanese Lesson
A cut to Japan's credit rating may not seem to mean much when the country already appears to live in a world of its own. But if Japan can be downgraded, so can Italy, and the United States. Standard & Poor's downward revision of Japan is rightly reverberating globally as well as kicking the yen.
The country's debt is obscenely high. Including short-term borrowings, the burden rises to twice G.D.P. Greece's debt is 150 percent of G.D.P., and yet Japan has not required a rescue. Far from it. Japan 's 10-year bonds are yielding only about 1.25 percent. The huge pool of domestic savings means the country, unlike other indebted economies like the United States, does not need foreign savings. The Japanese government is therefore running a fiscal deficit of 9 percent of G.D.P. and issuing still more debt, as if there is no constraint on its profligacy.
S.& P.'s downgrade is a reminder that all bad things may come to an end. Japan's risks come in part from demographics and the world. The population is shrinking and aging. The old will have to be looked after. There will be fewer workers to do it.
The yen may fall further, helping to banish deflation and stimulate growth. But the slide would also carry a risk. A weaker currency and a stronger economy might mean that more of the rampant inflation the world is feeling will pass through to Japan.
A recovering world helps governments fiscally but can intensify debt pressures. For Japan, only a small increase in bond yields would make the government's fiscal position disastrous. The debt is so huge that a crisis wouldn't require the catalyst of near-double-digit yields that sent Greece and Ireland into the arms of rescuers.
This should be a warning to other large and small economies that don't take their debt seriously. The recent recession and deflation made the bonds of governments that were not at immediate risk of default appealing. It is now time for the market to reassess. RICHARD BEALES and IAN CAMPBELL

Abstract: Almost three years ago, on April 6, 2008, the Egyptian government crushed a strike by a group of textile workers in the industrial city of Mahalla, and in response a group of young activists who connected through Facebook and other social networking Web sites formed the April 6th Youth Movement in solidarity with the strikers.

Full text: For decades, Egypt's authoritarian president, Hosni Mubarak, played a clever game with his political opponents.
He tolerated a tiny and toothless opposition of liberal intellectuals whose vain electoral campaigns created the facade of a democratic process. And he demonized the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood as a group of violent extremists who posed a threat that he used to justify his police state.
But this enduring and, many here say, all too comfortable relationship was upended this week by the emergence of an unpredictable third force, the leaderless tens of thousands of young Egyptians who turned out to demand an end to Mr. Mubarak's 30-year rule.
Now the older opponents are rushing to catch up.
"It was the young people who took the initiative and set the date and decided to go," Mohamed ElBaradei, the former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said Wednesday with some surprise during a telephone interview from his office in Vienna, shortly before rushing home to Cairo to join the revolt.
Dr. ElBaradei, a Nobel prize winner, has been the public face of an effort to reinvigorate and unite Egypt's fractious and ineffective opposition since he plunged into his home country's politics nearly a year ago, and he said the youth movement had accomplished that on its own. "Young people are impatient," he said. "Frankly, I didn't think the people were ready."
But their readiness -- tens of thousands have braved tear gas, rubber bullets and security police officers notorious for torture -- has threatened to upstage or displace the traditional opposition groups.
Many of the tiny, legally recognized political parties -- more than 20 in total, with scarcely a parlor full of grass-roots supporters among them -- are leaping to embrace the new movement for change but lack credibility with the young people in the street.
Even the Muslim Brotherhood may have grown too protective of its own institutions and position to capitalize on the new youth movement, say some analysts and former members. The Brotherhood remains the organization in Egypt with the largest base of support outside the government, but it can no longer claim to be the only entity that can turn masses of people out into the streets.
"The Brotherhood is no longer the most effective player in the political arena," said Emad Shahin, an Egyptian scholar now at the University of Notre Dame. "If you look at the Tunisian uprising, it's a youth uprising. It is the youth that knows how to use the media, Internet, Facebook, so there are other players now."
Dr. ElBaradei, for his part, has struggled for nearly a year to unite the opposition under his umbrella group, the National Association for Change. But some have mocked him as a globe-trotting dilettante who spends much of his time abroad instead of on the barricades.
He has said in interviews that he never presented himself as a political savior, and that Egyptians would have to make their own revolution. Now, he said, the youth movement "will give them the self-confidence they needed, to know that the change will happen through you and not through one person -- you are the driving force."
And Dr. ElBaradei argued that by upsetting the old relationship between Mr. Mubarak and the Brotherhood, the youth movement posed a new challenge to United States policy makers as well.
"For years," he said, "the West has bought Mr. Mubarak's demonization of the Muslim Brotherhood lock, stock and barrel, the idea that the only alternative here are these demons called the Muslim Brotherhood who are the equivalent of Al Qaeda."
He added: "I am pretty sure that any freely and fairly elected government in Egypt will be a moderate one, but America is really pushing Egypt and pushing the whole Arab world into radicalization with this inept policy of supporting repression."
The roots of the uprising that filled Egypt's streets this week arguably stretch back to before the Tunisian revolt, which many protesters cited as the catalyst. Almost three years ago, on April 6, 2008, the Egyptian government crushed a strike by a group of textile workers in the industrial city of Mahalla, and in response a group of young activists who connected through Facebook and other social networking Web sites formed the April 6th Youth Movement in solidarity with the strikers.
Their early efforts to call a general strike were a bust. But over time their leaderless online network and others that sprang up around it -- like the networks that helped propel the Tunisian revolution -- were uniquely difficult for the Egyptian security police to pinpoint or wipe out. It was an online rallying cry for a show of opposition to tyranny, corruption and torture that brought so many to the streets on Tuesday and Wednesday, unexpectedly vaulting the online youth movement to the forefront as the most effective independent political force in Egypt.
"It would be criminal for any political party to claim credit for the mini-Intifada we had yesterday," said Hossam el-Hamalawy, a blogger and activist.
Mr. Mubarak's government, though, is so far sticking to a familiar script. Against all evidence, his interior minister immediately laid blame for Wednesday's unrest at the foot of the government's age-old foe, the Muslim Brotherhood.
This time, though, the Brotherhood disclaimed responsibility, saying it was only one part of Dr. ElBaradei's umbrella group. "People took part in the protests in a spontaneous way, and there is no way to tell who belonged to what," said Gamal Nassar, a media adviser for the Brotherhood, noting the near-total absence of any group's signs or slogans, including the Brotherhood's.
"Everyone is suffering from social problems, unemployment, inflation, corruption and oppression," he said. "So what everyone is calling for is real change."
The Brotherhood operates a large network of schools and charities that make up for the many failings of government social services. Some analysts charge that the institutional inertia may make the Brotherhood slow to rock the Egyptian ship of state.
"The Brotherhood has been very silent," said Amr Hamzawy, research director at the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut. "It is not a movement that can benefit from what has been happening and get people out in the street."
Nor, Dr. ElBaradei argued, does the Muslim Brotherhood merit the fear its name evokes in the West. Its membership embraces large numbers of professors, lawyers and other professionals as well as followers who benefit from its charities. It has not committed or condoned acts of violence since the uprising against the British-backed Egyptian monarchy six decades ago, and it has endorsed his call for a pluralistic civil democracy.
"They are a religiously conservative group, no question about it, but they also represent about 20 percent of the Egyptian people," he said. "And how can you exclude 20 percent of the Egyptian people?"
Dr. ElBaradei, with his international prestige, is a difficult critic for Mr. Mubarak's government to jail, harass or besmirch, as it has many of his predecessors. And Dr. ElBaradei eases concerns about Islamists by putting a secular, liberal and familiar face on the opposition.
But he has been increasingly outspoken in his criticism of the West. He was stunned, he said, by the reaction of Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton to the Egyptian protests. In a statement after Tuesday's clashes, she urged restraint but described the Egyptian government as "stable" and "looking for ways to respond to the legitimate needs and interests of the Egyptian people."
" 'Stability' is a very pernicious word," he said. "Stability at the expense of 30 years of martial law, rigged elections?" He added, "If they come later and say, as they did in Tunis, 'We respect the will of the Tunisian people,' it will be a little late in the day."

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve policy makers voted unanimously on Wednesday to continue the central bank's $600 billion plan to spur the recovery by buying government bonds.
They took note of a rise in commodity prices, but reiterated their view that long-term inflation expectations had been stable and inflation had trended downward. The Fed's preferred measure of inflation excludes food and energy, which tend to have volatile prices.
The mention of rising commodity prices was a slight but notable acknowledgement of concerns that the bond-buying plan could eventually touch off inflation -- concerns that the Fed deems to be unwarranted for now.
As expected, the Fed left its benchmark short-term interest rate -- the federal funds rate, at which banks borrow from each other overnight -- at a range of 0 to 0.25 percent, unchanged since December 2008.
The unanimity within the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed panel that sets monetary policy, was a welcome and somewhat surprising vote of confidence for the Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, who has favored aggressive and unconventional measures to stimulate the economy, even in the face of criticism.
Under a rotation system used by the committee, four different regional Fed presidents joined the panel as voting members this year: Charles I. Plosser of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, Richard W. Fisher of Dallas, Charles L. Evans of Chicago and Narayana R. Kocherlakota of Minneapolis.
Mr. Plosser, Mr. Fisher and Mr. Kocherlakota have all raised doubts about the bond-buying program, which the Fed announced in November after hinting about it since August. But for now, they are backing Mr. Bernanke.
The program is intended to lower long-term interest rates, give a lift to stocks and other assets, and ease the flow of credit. But skeptics fear that the bond-buying, which has the effect of further expanding the Fed's already large balance sheet, could lead to destabilizing asset bubbles or touch off inflation.
Mr. Bernanke and his allies, who represent a majority of the board, say they think that the program has been effective in meeting its goals and that the worries are exaggerated; they say the Fed is ready to step in to prevent inflation from igniting. The committee's periodic assessment of economic conditions was little changed from its meeting in December.
The panel said that the recovery continued, "though at a rate that has been insufficient to bring about a significant improvement in labor market conditions." It continued to point to a "depressed" housing sector and household consumption "constrained" by high unemployment, modest income growth, the decline in home values and tight credit.
Victor E. Li, an economist at the Villanova School of Business, said that by not overreacting to recent improvements in employment and growth projections, the Fed seemed cautious. "I would have thought the statement would have been more optimistic," he said.
The bond-buying plan put in place by the Fed is commonly known as QE2, because it is a second round of the asset-purchase practice known as quantitative easing. From December 2008 to March 2010, the Fed bought $1.7 trillion in mortgage-related securities and Treasury securities to stabilize the housing market and provide support to an economy in the grip of recession.
The current round of easing -- $75 billion a month in bond purchases, starting in November -- is supposed to continue through June. The Fed could change that plan, and affirmed on Wednesday that it was ready to "adjust the program as needed." (In a related, smaller effort begun in August, the Fed is using the proceeds from its mortgage-related holdings to buy Treasury securities, and that effort is also continuing.)
Difficult decisions loom for the Fed: whether to allow the program to continue through June, and also -- if the frail recovery should suffer a setback -- whether to expand it beyond the $600 billion or extend it into the second half of this year. Central bank officials are already turning their attention to those questions but have offered little indication of their leanings, preferring instead to wait and see whether the economy continues to improve.
The Fed's outlook seems neither too pessimistic nor optimistic, said Michael Dueker, head economist for North America at Russell Investments. "Nothing in today's statement indicates that the Fed believes that additional quantitative easing will be necessary beyond June 2011," he said. "And nothing indicates that the Fed is fazed by the so-called strong economic data as of late."
Though the Dow Jones industrial average briefly hit 12,000 on Wednesday, a height not reached since 2008, investors seemed unsurprised by the Fed's announcement, which was in line with analysts' expectations.

Abstract: Yet concerns remain about overly aggressive lending by state-run banks. Since early 2009, Chinese banks have engaged in a record lending spree that has helped back state-owned companies and financed huge infrastructure and property projects.

Full text: SHANGHAI - The seemingly unstoppable rise of China has long been high on the agenda at the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. This year, though, the discussion is likely to include a greater focus on major challenges facing the country.
China is already the world's biggest exporter and the second-largest economy after the United States. The country has $2.9 trillion in foreign exchange reserves and is pushing to build its first aircraft carrier and land a spacecraft on the moon within two years.
But there are also potential problems ahead in 2011. At home, there are growing worries about inflation, including rising property prices and the possibility that a widening income gap between the rich and the poor could threaten social stability.
On the international front, China is struggling with trade friction over its currency policy and coming off what analysts say was a year of diplomatic missteps.
Minxin Pei, who teaches political science at Claremont McKenna College in California, said China undermined its standing last year with a more assertive and erratic posture in foreign affairs.
Among other things, he said, China needlessly confronted the United States over the sale of weapons to Taiwan, berated Japan for its decision to detain the captain of a Chinese fishing trawler and lashed out at the West in an exaggerated way after Norway awarded the Nobel Peace Prize to Liu Xiaobo, a Chinese dissident.
"This may reflect the nature of the regime and its autocratic system," Dr. Pei said. "But in the end, they're pragmatists. They're not led by blind megalomaniacs. So there may be some adjustments. There is some hope."
Sensing discord in its foreign relations, China has responded in recent months with what some analysts see as a series of charm offensives.
Delegations of high-ranking Chinese leaders have traveled to world capitals to sign multibillion-dollar trade and investment deals. In Europe this month, Chinese leaders pledged to support the euro, in part by buying the sovereign debt of some weakened euro zone members.
And when President Hu Jintao of China visited Washington last week, China signed business deals that promised to create a quarter-million American jobs. Beijing also tried a dose of soft power by releasing a promotional video showing positive images of China and Chinese celebrities. The images are being broadcast on giant television screens in Times Square in New York.
But those efforts had been undermined by diplomatic stances that seem increasingly hardheaded, said Orville Schell, director of the Center on U.S.-China Relations at the Asia Society in New York.
"There's a muscular resistance to any kind of cooperation that might seem like yielding to U.S. demands and interests," Mr. Schell said. "For the last hundred years, China has wanted to be in the position where it's not pushed around. And now they are close to that.
"It should be a sweet moment. But when such cooperation even so much as hints at submission, it becomes difficult. Especially at a high, visible level, this concern makes the give-and-take that is essential in working out common problems very difficult."
Other analysts say the United States and Europe need to accept some of the blame for souring relations. Kishore Mahbubani, dean of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore, said the West often demonized China, and Western leaders tended to lecture the Chinese in a way that could be seen as disrespectful and was likely to fan resentment among Chinese officials.
"The West is terrified because they've dominated history for the past 200 years and now China's emerging," Mr. Mahbubani said. "But we should all recognize that a multipolar world is much better than a unipolar world."
Still, the ruling Communist Party's chief concerns this year are internal, analysts say. Top among them are maintaining strong economic growth, which helps improve the livelihood of its citizens and also reduces the likelihood of social instability and challenges to the party.
To strengthen the economy, the government has promised to rein in inflation and soaring property prices. Several big cities are considering new property taxes. And local governments have announced plans to build more low-income housing.
Many economists have forecast another year of stellar economic growth, with the Chinese economy expected to grow about 9 percent. Yet concerns remain about overly aggressive lending by state-run banks.
Since early 2009, Chinese banks have engaged in a record lending spree that has helped back state-owned companies and financed huge infrastructure and property projects. Analysts say the policies probably encouraged loose lending standards, which could increase the likelihood of a sharp rise in nonperforming loans - something that seriously threatened state-run banks less than a decade ago.
The government has also pledged to revamp the economy, moving away from a heavy reliance on exports and government investment and toward more domestic consumption.
Chinese leaders are supporting efforts to increase the wages of average workers and are encouraging more investment in inland provinces, which have lagged far behind the nation's coastal cities.
But getting Chinese consumers to spend more will not be easy, analysts say, particularly in a nation with a relatively weak social safety net.
Another barrier to change is what some analysts say is a quiet shift in government policy away from market-oriented changes toward ones that back state-owned companies and so-called national champions.
Two recently published books argue that China has been moving away from Western-style capitalism toward what is called state capitalism, in which the government and state-owned companies team up to dominate business and the economy and compete with multinational corporations from abroad.
In "Red Capitalism," Carl E. Walter and Fraser J.T. Howie, wrote that the Chinese government's efforts to change the nation's banks and financial system had stalled from 2003 to 2005 as various government agencies battled for control over the banking system.
While the outside world sees a vibrant Chinese stock market, splashy initial public offerings and new billionaires - all ostensibly signs of an increasingly market-oriented economy - the reality, they say, is a system in which the state manipulates the markets to raise huge sums of money and then forces the banking system to make wasteful loans to state-owned companies.
The real turning point came after the financial crisis, when China lost confidence in Wall Street's financial model, said Ian Bremmer, president of the Eurasia Group, a consulting firm, and author of "The End of the Free Market: Who Wins the War Between States and Corporations?" China then began adopting a system that allowed the state to use its assets to move markets and strengthen support at home.
This, Mr. Bremmer said, will greatly alter the relationship between China and Western countries like the United States, generating more conflicts over jobs and market access.
"This has certainly changed the calculus," Mr. Bremmer said in an interview. "This means the most important economic relationship in the world will become an increasingly zero-sum game."
