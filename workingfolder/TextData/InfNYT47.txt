Full text: This was the year that Wall Street turned a crash into a bang.
Stock markets will ring out one of their most volatile periods in history Thursday with an incredible rally that replenished half the losses caused by the financial crisis.
While the Dow Jones industrial average zigzagged through the last 10 years to finish near its start, 2009 proved to be the best year after the comeback in 2003, which followed another epic crisis, the dot-com bust.
The Dow Jones industrial average will likely end the year up more than 20 percent, and the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index nearly 25 percent. Shares of troubled banks like Bank of America, which tumbled more than 90 percent when markets were packed with fear, are resurgent after they repaid billions the government lent them to make it through the crisis.
But whether investors continue to see these gains will depend on more than an economic recovery.
As the recession ebbs, interest rates are expected to rise in 2010, weakening the fragile rebound that is emerging in corners of the housing market. Unemployment may be peaking, but many Americans are still struggling to pay bills, or even avoid foreclosure. And the government is starting to pull back on the cheap financing it used to stimulate the economy and nurse the financial industry back to health.
If recent signs of growth fizzle out, markets could once again lose their ebullience, as they have several times in the last two years. A solid recovery would push stocks higher, though few analysts expect the market to repeat its stunning 2009 performance.
"There are long, long periods of time when the market and the economy go two different ways," said Barry Ritholtz, a professional investor and author of "Bailout Nation," a book about the causes of the financial crisis. "A rallying market doesn't necessarily mean the economy is healing."
For much of the decade, the stock market has been a great disappointment. As of Wednesday, the S.& P. index closed 23 percent below and the Dow closed 8.25 percent below where they ended 10 years ago, in 1999. The Nasdaq, the average that was hit hardest by the bursting of the dot-com bubble, is down 44 percent over that period.
How markets will look in the coming decade will be determined in part by policy makers. A too-rapid withdrawal by the government of fiscal or monetary support for the economy could throw markets into fresh tumult. But if policy makers take too long to let go, they could help to re-inflate bubbles in stock, housing and other markets.
"If things are booming, policy makers will feel empowered to remove stimulus quickly," said Marc Stern, chief investment officer at Bessemer Trust, an investment firm in New York. "If you are an investor, what you actually want is the Goldilocks phenomenon -- not too hot, not too cold."
For now, many investors are starting to believe that the painful 10 years just concluded has laid the foundation for a new bull market, just as the misery of the 1930s was followed by a postwar boom. These optimists say the worst of the financial crisis is over now that the big banks are making money once again.
While the economy remains weak, their argument goes, it is growing again. Inflation remains tame and interest rates are low. Fewer jobless claims are being filed and some companies, like FedEx, are starting to hire again. Industrial activity is showing sparks of life, while a weak dollar has helped American companies sell more overseas, especially to emerging markets like China and India, which are still growing rapidly.
"It's very fair to say we are going to have a less robust recovery than normal," said Tobias Levkovich, chief United States equity strategist at Citigroup. But "that's very different than saying we will have a very difficult recovery or no recovery."
Yet more bearish investors, and there are still many of them, see little reason for optimism. They say that the economy will struggle for some time because of problems like rising defaults on commercial mortgages and the large number of Americans who are unable to find full-time work, which reduces consumer spending.
"People who have lost their jobs are obviously not going to be consuming very much," said James Melcher, president of Balestra Capital, a hedge fund firm in New York, who is bearish about American stocks.
They worry that the recovery is still too reliant on government support, some that is scheduled to end soon. The $787 billion federal stimulus package is expected to peter out in the coming months, for instance.
At the same time, investors could also grow fearful of the huge bill that America is accumulating to spend its way to recovery. The White House estimates government debt accounted for 90 percent of the economy's total output in 2009, up from 70 percent a year earlier. While the cost of borrowing for the government and others remains historically low today, it could surge higher in the coming years.
The credit crisis also remains a big concern, as demonstrated by the government's growing financial commitment to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The companies are still saddled with large mortgage liabilities and will most likely receive hundreds of billions of dollars in taxpayer support.
Meanwhile, banks and other financial institutions will face new waves of problems as more borrowers default on commercial mortgages and other loans in the coming year. At the end of September, delinquencies on commercial real estate loans held by banks climbed to 8.7 percent, their highest levels since 1993, according to the Federal Reserve.
As a result, Mr. Melcher said he did not believe that companies would be able to increase sales and profits very much, or at all. Analysts should get another glimpse of how well companies are doing in a few weeks, when firms announce their results for the end of 2009.
Given all these challenges, skeptics worry that the breathtaking rally -- the S.& P. 500 index has surged 66 percent since March -- has made stocks too expensive. The 10-year price-to-earnings ratio of the S.& P. 500, a measure of how expensive stocks are relative to profits, was more than 20.3 in late December, up from 13.3 in March. The average for the last 130 years is 16.4, according to calculations by Robert J. Shiller, the Yale economist.
Mr. Ritholtz said that just as investors were overly pessimistic in March, when stocks fell to their lowest level in more than a decade, they have become irrationally optimistic about the recovery.
"History tells us that this will end with a substantial correction," he said.

CHARTS: The Difference a Year Makes: In March, the stock market was on track to have its worst year ever. Gains since then turned 2009 into one of the best years this decade, though one of the broadest measures of the market, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, still remains 28 percent below its October 2007 peak.

Full text: For China, 2009 was a momentous year. The People's Republic turned 60, and Beijing staved off economic disaster with a staggering 4 trillion renminbi ($585 billion) stimulus package. The stage is set for an eventful 2010. China's economy is poised to become the world's second largest. But all may not go well.
There are three broad concerns for the coming Year of the Tiger on the lunar calendar: inflation, protectionism and inequality.
One type of inflation has already arrived. As a result of some $1.5 trillion of government-mandated bank lending in 2009, combined with speculative capital flowing from abroad, the prices of financial assets like stocks and property have exploded. Beijing clocked a record land-sale price in 2009 and Hong Kong a record apartment price. The first batch of stocks on Shenzhen's new growth-stock market doubled on their first day of trading. The second batch, just over a month later, tripled.
While asset prices soar and the cost of basic commodities like oil and iron ore remain high by historic standards, retail prices are barely increasing. Many central banks and governments face this confusing situation, and none of them have an obvious solution. A rise in policy interest rates could take cash out of consumers' and producers' pockets, slowing growth to a crawl. In Beijing, that sounds like political suicide.
In the semi-controlled Chinese economy, the authorities have turned to restrictions on lending to try to reduce the monetary pressure. But that may not succeed. The strong links between banks and local governments mean new loans don't always go to the most productive channels.
Next year's lending target is 25 percent less than 2009's. But perhaps two-thirds of the disbursed money will go to sustain half-finished infrastructure projects, leaving little for new business investment.
If tighter policy slows growth too sharply, the government could decide that inflation of any sort is the lesser evil. But monetary instability carries its own political and economic risks.
Protectionism could be another problem. Trade skirmishes surfaced in 2009: the United States slapped tariffs on Chinese tires, and China did the same on American and Russian steel. Those are special cases, but the low exchange rate for China's currency can be considered an unfair export subsidy which lures American consumers into overspending.
Some economists are already arguing that Chinese currency inaction justifies tariffs for the sake of balancing trade. Disgruntled politicians in Washington could join in, especially if the American unemployment rate, already at 10 percent, keeps rising. They could claim that Chinese production threatens to accelerate global warming. True or not, trade restrictions would severely disrupt China's still export-dependent economy.
The third risk, inequality, is the least visible but the most dangerous. It's a genuine issue. The mix of fast-rising asset prices with wages that are hardly budging must be widening the gap between owners and the property-poor proletariat. The reported unemployment rate of 4 percent ignores an estimated 150 million migrant workers, while fewer than 70 percent of graduates have jobs.
The biggest worry for policy makers is that an idle and unequal populace will create unrest. A recent survey by the Zhejiang Academy of Social Sciences cited in the South China Morning Post found that 96 percent of respondents "resent the rich." It is no accident that Xinjiang province, which saw riots in 2009, has one of China's biggest wealth gaps.
The available measures suggest China is becoming more unequal at an alarming rate. In 1983, China's Gini coefficient, a measure of economic inequality, was 0.28, roughly the same as Sweden, Japan and Germany. By 2007, the Asian Development Bank estimated China's Gini coefficient of 0.47 -- closer to Argentina and Mexico. That pace of acceleration is virtually unheard of.
China could probably address each of these three problems, one at a time. Inflation can be micromanaged through a controlled bank system. Protectionism can be quelled with diplomacy, unrest with force. The last 30 years -- in which China's sustained growth has exceeded anything recorded -- is a triumph of mind over matter. But if all three challenges arrive at once, the Year of the Tiger could prove fierce indeed.

Wall Street Overcomes a Slip To Extend Its Winning Streak

Abstract: [...] shares turned around, driven by better holiday sales, rising commodities prices and signs of growth in Asia.

Full text: The headline on the markets is beginning to sound repetitious: Wall Street on Monday finished at its high for the year while extending its winning streak to six days.
But a bit of drama occurred on Monday, even if it was in part because of swings caused by light trading. Shares, which traded higher for much of the morning, lost their momentum in the afternoon and were in negative territory less than a half-hour before the close.
In the end, shares turned around, driven by better holiday sales, rising commodities prices and signs of growth in Asia.
At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 26.98 points, or 0.26 percent, at 10,547.08; the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 0.12 percent, or 1.30 points, to 1,127.78, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq rose 5.39 points, or 0.24 percent, to 2,291.08.
A report showing that holiday sales in the United States were up 3.6 percent -- compared with a 2.3 percent drop a year ago -- sent the markets in the right direction. Still, the results were not surprising enough to sway the market in what is traditionally a sleepy week. Excluding an extra day of shopping this year, the gain was about 1 percent compared with last year, in line with expectations.
"We're not seeing the end-of-the-world situation that was with us last year," said Bill Schultz, chief investment officer for McQueen, Ball & Associates. "The holiday sales numbers give investors reason to think that maybe things are not getting worse. The question now is, 'Are things actually getting better?' "
Financial shares, particularly regional banks, were among the losers, though giants like Citigroup and Bank of America bucked that trend, closing up 1.2 percent and 0.26 percent, respectively.
Trying to take some of the $1 trillion in excess cash out of the financial system, the Federal Reserve proposed a program to sell term deposits to banks. The proposal "has no implications for monetary policy decisions in the near term," the central bank said in a statement.
Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, is preparing tools and strategies to shrink or neutralize the effects of inflation from the largest monetary expansion in history.
Airline stocks in the United States were lower on Monday, as the federal government tried to explain why security officers had not caught a Nigerian man who the authorities said was planning to blow up a Detroit-bound airliner on Christmas Day. Shares of Delta Air Lines, which operated the flight, fell 4 percent; AMR, the parent of American Airlines, dropped 4.8 percent; and UAL, the parent of United, 3.4 percent.
The price of oil climbed 72 cents, to settle at $78.77 a barrel, also in light trading, helping drive up shares of energy companies, including Exxon Mobil.
The dollar weakened against other currencies, trading at $1.438 against the euro. That in turn helped to push gold prices higher.
In Europe, the CAC 40 in France closed up 0.88 percent, or 34.42 points, to 3,947.15, inching closer to the 4,000-point threshold it last crossed in October 2008. The DAX in Germany climbed 0.76 percent, or 45.48 points, to 6,002.92. The London exchange was closed for Boxing Day.
The Treasury's 10-year note fell 11/32, to 96 6/32. The yield rose to 3.84 percent, from 3.80 percent on Thursday.
Following are the results of Monday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills and two-year notes:

Full text: Maybe we knew, at some unconscious, instinctive level, that it would be an era best forgotten. Whatever the reason, we got through the first decade of the new millennium without ever agreeing on what to call it. The aughts? The naughties? Whatever. (Yes, I know that strictly speaking the millennium didn't begin until 2001. Do we really care?)
But from an economic point of view, I'd suggest that we call the decade past the Big Zero. It was a decade in which nothing good happened, and none of the optimistic things we were supposed to believe turned out to be true.
It was a decade with basically zero job creation. O.K., the headline employment number for December 2009 will be slightly higher than that for December 1999, but only slightly. And private-sector employment has actually declined -- the first decade on record in which that happened.
It was a decade with zero economic gains for the typical family. Actually, even at the height of the alleged "Bush boom," in 2007, median household income adjusted for inflation was lower than it had been in 1999. And you know what happened next.
It was a decade of zero gains for homeowners, even if they bought early: right now housing prices, adjusted for inflation, are roughly back to where they were at the beginning of the decade. And for those who bought in the decade's middle years -- when all the serious people ridiculed warnings that housing prices made no sense, that we were in the middle of a gigantic bubble -- well, I feel your pain. Almost a quarter of all mortgages in America, and 45 percent of mortgages in Florida, are underwater, with owners owing more than their houses are worth.
Last and least for most Americans -- but a big deal for retirement accounts, not to mention the talking heads on financial TV -- it was a decade of zero gains for stocks, even without taking inflation into account. Remember the excitement when the Dow first topped 10,000, and best-selling books like "Dow 36,000" predicted that the good times would just keep rolling? Well, that was back in 1999. Last week the market closed at 10,520.
So there was a whole lot of nothing going on in measures of economic progress or success. Funny how that happened.
For as the decade began, there was an overwhelming sense of economic triumphalism in America's business and political establishments, a belief that we -- more than anyone else in the world -- knew what we were doing.
Let me quote from a speech that Lawrence Summers, then deputy Treasury secretary (and now the Obama administration's top economist), gave in 1999. "If you ask why the American financial system succeeds," he said, "at least my reading of the history would be that there is no innovation more important than that of generally accepted accounting principles: it means that every investor gets to see information presented on a comparable basis; that there is discipline on company managements in the way they report and monitor their activities." And he went on to declare that there is "an ongoing process that really is what makes our capital market work and work as stably as it does."
So here's what Mr. Summers -- and, to be fair, just about everyone in a policy-making position at the time -- believed in 1999: America has honest corporate accounting; this lets investors make good decisions, and also forces management to behave responsibly; and the result is a stable, well-functioning financial system.
What percentage of all this turned out to be true? Zero.
What was truly impressive about the decade past, however, was our unwillingness, as a nation, to learn from our mistakes.
Even as the dot-com bubble deflated, credulous bankers and investors began inflating a new bubble in housing. Even after famous, admired companies like Enron and WorldCom were revealed to have been Potemkin corporations with facades built out of creative accounting, analysts and investors believed banks' claims about their own financial strength and bought into the hype about investments they didn't understand. Even after triggering a global economic collapse, and having to be rescued at taxpayers' expense, bankers wasted no time going right back to the culture of giant bonuses and excessive leverage.
Then there are the politicians. Even now, it's hard to get Democrats, President Obama included, to deliver a full-throated critique of the practices that got us into the mess we're in. And as for the Republicans: now that their policies of tax cuts and deregulation have led us into an economic quagmire, their prescription for recovery is -- tax cuts and deregulation.
So let's bid a not at all fond farewell to the Big Zero -- the decade in which we achieved nothing and learned nothing. Will the next decade be better? Stay tuned. Oh, and happy New Year.

Abstract: Borrowing a concept from corporate finance, governments could sell a new type of security that commits them to paying shares in national "profit," as measured by gross domestic product.

Full text: CORPORATIONS raise money by issuing both debt and equity, the latter giving investors an implicit share in future profits. Governments should do something like this, too, and not just rely on debt.
Borrowing a concept from corporate finance, governments could sell a new type of security that commits them to paying shares in national "profit," as measured by gross domestic product.
Historically, one impediment to such a move was the difficulty in accounting on a national scale: governments didn't even try to measure G.D.P. until well into the 20th century.
Although G.D.P. numbers still aren't perfect -- they are subject to periodic revisions, for example -- the basic problem has been largely solved. So why not issue shares in G.D.P. now?
Such securities might help assuage doubts that governments can sustain the deficit spending required to keep sagging economies stimulated and protected from the threat of a truly serious recession. In a recent pairof papers, my Canadian colleague Mark Kamstra at York University and I have proposed a solution. We'd like our countries to issue securities that we call "trills," short for trillionths.
Let me explain: Each trill would represent one-trillionth of the country's G.D.P. And each would pay in perpetuity, and in domestic currency, a quarterly dividend equal to a trillionth of the nation's quarterly nominal G.D.P.
If substantial markets could be established for them, trills would be a major new source of government funding. Trills would be issued with the full faith and credit of the respective governments. That means investors could trust that governments would pay out shares of G.D.P. as promised, or buy back the trills at market prices.
If trills were issued by Canada, for example, they would pay about 1.50 Canadian dollars in dividends this year, one trillionth of the annual cash flow. The value of the security is derived from the dividend, and might be priced very highly in the market -- perhaps at around 150 Canadian dollars -- given that country's strong prospects for growth. Trills issued by the United States Treasury would pay about $14 in dividends this year and might fetch $1,400 a trill or more.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index now has a dividend yield of 2.3 percent. The dividend yield on trills might be much lower, reflecting the substantially higher long-term growth rate of G.D.P. relative to S.& P. dividends -- in real terms, 3.1 percent versus 1.1 percent a year, respectively, since 1957.
The market price of trills would fluctuate, reflecting the changing prospects for future G.D.P. growth, just as the market price of stocks reflects the changing prospects for future earnings growth. There is no complexity here. It is all plain-vanilla financing, though unconventional by today's standards.
There are indications that officials in China are starting to worry about threats to their huge investment in United States debt from a possible outbreak of high inflation. The trills, tied to nominal G.D.P., would protect them. Right now TIPS, or Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, are offering disappointingly low yields, which may have to be raised to attract more investment. Trills, even at an ultralow dividend yield, would seem more exciting as an inflation-protected prospect, because they represent a share in future economic growth.
The United States government is highly unlikely to default on its debt, but even this remote possibility would be virtually eliminated by trills, because the government's dividend burden would automatically decline in tough times, when G.D.P. declined.
The final statement of the Group of 20 economic meeting in Pittsburgh in September pledged to "establish a pattern of growth across countries that is more sustainable and balanced, and reduce development imbalances." These imbalances -- exemplified by the massive Chinese holdings of United States government debt -- might not be so worrisome if the investments were financed better.
In fact, issuing shares in G.D.P. might even be viewed as a policy that systematically rectifies a wide array of imbalances in capital flows. People who expect strong economic growth in a country would bid up the price of a claim on its G.D.P., creating a cheap source of funding for the issuing government. So a country with good investment prospects gets the resources at a low current cost. There would be no need for central bank machinations to try to correct global imbalances.
We already have international equity markets that allow international investments in private firms within countries. But these do not represent the entire economy. Corporate stocks represent implicit claims on after-tax corporate profits, which typically amount to no more than 10 percent of G.D.P. Moreover, after-tax corporate profits are a much more slippery concept than G.D.P., affected as they are by many domestic policies, including taxes, government involvement in labor disputes and even government bailouts -- as we now know very well.
Someday, China might issue shares in its G.D.P., too, and international investors who would love to participate in its economic miracle might put a very high price on them. That could help secure international financing of future growth without relying on the enormous government and enterprise saving that is now suppressing China's standard of living.
PROPOSALS for securities like trills have been aired many times over the years. I argued for them in "Macro Markets," my 1993 book. The Nobel laureate Robert Merton has had similar proposals. Other ideas for G.D.P.-linked securities have been advanced by John Williamson at the Peterson Institute, by a group at the United Nations Development Program, by Kristin Forbes of the Council of Economic Advisers under George W. Bush, and by Eduardo Borensztein of the Inter-American Development Bank and Paulo Mauro of the International Monetary Fund.
So far, these proposals have gone unheeded. But the current environment may be more suitable for them.

Full text: Millions of Americans are paying a high price for a safe place to put their money: extremely low interest rates on savings accounts and certificates of deposit.
The elderly and others on fixed incomes have been especially hard hit. Many have seen returns on savings, C.D.'s and government bonds drop to niggling amounts recently, often costing them money once inflation, fees and taxes are considered.
"Open a Savings Plus Account today and get a great rate," read an advertisement in the Dec. 16 Newsday for Citibank, which was then offering 1.2 percent for an account. (As low as it was, the offer was good only for accounts of $25,000 and up.)
"They're advertising it in the papers as if they're actually proud of that," said Steven Weisman, a title insurance consultant in New York. "It's a joke."
The advertised rate for the Savings Plus account has expired, according to the bank's Web site; as of Friday, the account paid an interest rate of 0.5 percent. The bank's highest-yield savings account, the Ultimate, was paying 1.01 percent.
The best deal Mr. Weisman has found is 2 percent on a one-year certificate of deposit offered by ING Direct, an online bank that has become a bit of a darling among the fixed-income crowd.
Interest on one- and two-year Treasury notes was just 0.40 percent and 0.89 percent, as of Monday. Bank of America offers 0.35 percent on a standard money market account with $10,000 to $25,000, and Wells Fargo will pay 0.05 percent on a basic savings account.
Indeed, after fees are subtracted, inflation is accounted for and taxes are paid, many investors in C.D.'s, government bonds and savings and money market accounts are losing money. In fact, Northern Trust waived some $8 million in fees on money market accounts because they would have wiped out all interest, and then some.
"The unemployment situation and the general downturn in the economy had an impact, but what's going to happen now as C.D.'s mature is that retirees and the elderly are going to take anywhere from a half to three-quarters of a percent cut in their incomes," said Joe Parks, a retired accountant in Houston on the advisory board of Better Investing, an organization that works to help people become savvier investors. "It's a real problem."
Experts say risk-averse investors are effectively financing a second bailout of financial institutions, many of which have also raised fees and interest rates on credit cards.
"What the average citizen doesn't explicitly understand is that a significant part of the government's plan to repair the financial system and the economy is to pay savers nothing and allow damaged financial institutions to earn a nice, guaranteed spread," said William H. Gross, co-chief investment officer of the Pacific Investment Management Company, or Pimco. "It's capitalism, I guess, but it's not to be applauded."
Mr. Gross said he read his monthly portfolio statement twice because he could not believe that the line "Yield on cash" was 0.01 percent. At that rate, he said, it would take him 6,932 years to double his money.
Many think the Federal Reserve is fueling a stock market bubble by keeping rates so low that investors decide to bet on stocks instead. Mr. Parks of Better Investing moved more money into the stock market early this year, when C.D.'s he held began maturing and he could not nearly recover the income they had generated by rolling them over.
He began investing some of the money in blue chip stocks with a dividend yield of at least 3 percent and even managed to find an oil-and-gas limited partnership that offered 8 percent.
Mr. Parks said, however, that he would not pursue that strategy as more of his C.D.'s matured. "What worked in the first quarter of this year isn't as relevant, because the market has come up so much," he said.
No one is advising a venture into higher-risk investments. Katie Nixon, chief investment officer for the northeast region at Northern Trust, said that, in general, "no one should be taking risks with their pillow money."
"What people are paying for is safety and security," she said, "and that's probably just right."
People who rely on income from such investments for support, however, are being forced to consider new options.
Eileen Lurie, 75, is taking out a reverse mortgage to help offset the decline in returns on her investments tied to interest rates. Reverse mortgages have a checkered reputation, but Ms. Lurie said her bank was going out of its way to explain the product to her.
"These banks don't want to be held responsible for thousands of seniors standing in bread lines," she said.
Such mortgages allow people who are 62 and older to convert equity in their homes into cash tax-free and without any impact on Social Security or Medicare payments. The loans are repaid after death.
"If your assets aren't appreciating and aren't producing any income, you're getting eaten up in this interest rate environment," said Peter Strauss, a lawyer who advises the elderly. "A reverse mortgage is one way of making a very large asset produce income."
Eve Wilmore, 93, has watched returns on her C.D.'s drop to between 1 percent and 2 percent from about 5 percent a year or so ago. Yet the Social Security Administration recently raised her Medicare Part B premium based on those higher rates she had been earning. "I'm being hit from both sides," Mrs. Wilmore said. "There's some way I can apply for a reconsideration, and I'm going to fight it. I have to."
She said she was reluctant to redeploy her money into higher-risk investments. "I don't know what my medical bills will be from here on in, and so I want to keep the money where I can get to it easily if I need it," she said.
Peter Gomori, who taught a course on money and investing for Dorot, a nonprofit that offers services for the elderly, did not advise his students on investment strategies but said that if he had, he would probably have told them to sit tight.
"I know interest rates are very low for Treasury securities and bank products, but that isn't going to be forever," he said.
But investment professionals doubt rates will rise any time soon -- or to any level close to those before the crash.
"What the futures market is telling me," Mr. Gross said, "is that in April 2011, these savers that are currently earning nothing will be earning 1.25 percent."

Abstract: The index excluding food and energy -- an inflation measure favored by the Federal Reserve -- rose less than 0.1 percent. "[...] the economy firms up a little more, we probably won't have to worry about inflation," said Scott Hoyt, senior director of consumer economics at Moody'sEconomy.com.

Full text: Consumers and housing are usually the forces that help dig the United States economy out of a downturn, but their role in the current recovery remains uncertain, government reports released Wednesday indicated.
Consumer spending rose modestly, 0.5 percent, for the sixth time in seven months. Adjusted for inflation, spending increased 0.2 percent in November, according to the Commerce Department.
The spending numbers improved in part because consumers had more money available. Smaller job losses in November and a slight increase in the hours that employees worked bolstered wages and salaries, and overall personal income rose 0.4 percent in November.
But consumers were still unwilling to open their wallets too wide, given concern over how much wealth they have lost in the last two years and the weak job market.
"The consumer is not going to be a key driver of the recovery, but will go along for the ride as incomes improve," said Nigel Gault, chief United States economist at HIS Global Insight.
The savings rate, which is measured as the percentage of after-tax income that people choose not to spend, has hovered just below 5 percent for six months. While that its still beneath its average of the last few decades, it is much higher than the near-zero rate consumers adopted in the years leading up to the financial crisis.
A higher savings rate is good for the economy's long-term health because it makes more capital available to help businesses grow. In the short term, however, it can slow a recovery because the economy is partly dependent on consumers' willingness to spend.
The report also showed that inflation remains under control, for the time being.
The price index based on consumer spending increased 0.2 percent in November. The index excluding food and energy -- an inflation measure favored by the Federal Reserve -- rose less than 0.1 percent.
"Until the economy firms up a little more, we probably won't have to worry about inflation," said Scott Hoyt, senior director of consumer economics at Moody'sEconomy.com. "Maybe two to three years out, inflation will become a concern again, but it's certainly not an issue for today."
More troublesome news came from the Census Bureau's new-home sales report, a volatile indicator that showed purchases of new one-family houses tumbling last month.
Sales fell to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 355,000 in November, an 11.3 percent drop from October and its lowest rate since April. The numbers were much lower than analysts had predicted and seemed to belie trends in other housing data that gave hope the industry was stabilizing.
Economists caution, however, that the decline may simply be a hiccup that resulted from a confusing policy debate in Washington.
A home buyer tax credit had encouraged Americans to purchase homes. But with its original expiration date nearing in November, and the possibility that Congress would extend it still unclear, buyers probably were reluctant to sign for a new home.
"People didn't know what the financing situation would be when they closed," the chief economist at ITG, Robert Barbera, said.
In the end, Congress chose to extend the credit and even expand the pool of eligible buyers.
"A lot people will be horrified by the November numbers, but I'm willing to dismiss it," Mr. Barbera said, adding that he does not expect "further deterioration."
The anticipated end of the tax credit this fall, however, may have motivated some people who had planned to buy next year to buy a little earlier, potentially depressing sales in 2010.
Economists predict that the United States economy grew at an annual rate of about 4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2009, after a 2.2 percent annualized increase in the previous quarter. The ramp-up will probably primarily come from inventory building rather the consumer side, which is still depressed because of the sluggish job market.
"Consumers need jobs to start to become more confident," John Ryding, the chief economist at RDQ Economics, said. "But we're really not at that point yet."

Full text: Lincoln Gordon, a diplomat, educator and political economist who was the American ambassador to Brazil in the Kennedy and Johnson administrations and the president of Johns Hopkins University in the late 1960s, died on Saturday at an assisted-living home near Washington. He was 96.
Dr. Gordon died at Collington Episcopal Life Care in Mitchellville, Md., where he had lived for the past two years, his son Robert said. He had been a Washington resident for many years and was still an active associate of the Brookings Institution there.
A scholarly, pipe-smoking economist who earned a doctorate at Oxford and was a Harvard professor for many years, Dr. Gordon was posted to Paris and London as an administrator of the Marshall Plan for European recovery after World War II. He served as the United States envoy to Brazil from 1961 to 1966 and was the president of Johns Hopkins from 1967 to 1971.
He was the author of books on government, the economy, energy and national security, foreign policy in Europe and Latin America, and Brazil's emergence from military dictatorships to partnership with the nations of North and South America. He also wrote many articles on North Atlantic Treaty Organization strategies, the integration of Europe and the Alliance for Progress in Latin America.
In a career split between academic appointments and government service, Dr. Gordon, a Democrat, taught business and international affairs at Harvard, served on the War Production Board during World War II and was later a consultant to the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission, a White House economics adviser and the assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs.
Abraham Lincoln Gordon, who never used his first name, was born on Sept. 10, 1913, in New York to Bernard and Dorothy Lerner Gordon. His father was a lawyer and his mother moderated youth forums broadcast by NBC and for The New York Times on WQXR. He attended Ethical Culture schools, graduated with high honors from Harvard in 1933 and earned his doctorate as a Rhodes scholar in 1936.
In 1937, he married the former Allison Wright. She died in 1987. Besides his son Robert, of New Haven, he is survived by two daughters, Sally Gordon of Los Angeles and Amy Gordon of Gill, Mass.; another son, Hugh, of Ardmore, Pa.; seven grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.
After the election of President John F. Kennedy in 1960, Dr. Gordon served on a task force that developed the Alliance for Progress, the program that provided aid intended to dissuade Latin America from revolution and socialism. Dr. Gordon took up the ambassadorship in Brazil in 1961 at a time of high inflation and just as a left-wing president, Joao Goulart, took office.
President Goulart was deposed in a right-wing military coup in 1964. Accusations that Dr. Gordon, his staff and the Central Intelligence Agency had been involved in the coup were repeatedly denied.
But in 1976, nearly a decade after stepping down as ambassador, Dr. Gordon acknowledged that the Johnson administration had been prepared to intervene militarily to prevent a leftist takeover of the government.
After returning from Brazil in 1967, Dr. Gordon, in addition to his State Department role, coordinated aid to Latin America through the Alliance for Progress. When he stepped down a year later to accept the Johns Hopkins presidency, President Lyndon B. Johnson praised his service as "a rare combination of experience and scholarship, idealism and practical judgment."
Dr. Gordon's four years at Johns Hopkins were dogged by deteriorating finances, faculty complaints over pay and academic priorities, and students rebellious over the "relevance" of their educations. He resigned in 1971.
From 1972 to 1975, Dr. Gordon was a fellow of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars at the Smithsonian Institution.
Later in the 1970s, he was associated with Resources for the Future, a research and policy organization in Washington, and since 1984 had been an economist with Brookings, which studies domestic and foreign policy issues.
His books include "A New Deal for Latin America" (1963), "Growth Policies and the International Order" (1979), "Energy Strategies for Developing Nations" (1981), "Eroding Empire: Western Relations with Eastern Europe" (1987) and "Brazil's Second Chance" (2001).

Full text: IT has been a wonderful stretch for the stock market, especially if you disregard last winter's steep plunge, to say nothing of the dismal year that preceded it.
Since the market turned around on March 9, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has gained more than 60 percent, making this one of the most powerful rallies on record. But will the current bull market continue long enough for investors to fully repair portfolios that still bear the brunt of earlier carnage?
Investment professionals have strong opinions on the subject, and very few are entirely upbeat.
Doug Ramsey, research director of the Leuthold Group in Minneapolis, for example, is fairly optimistic about the market -- for the short term. His firm sets a target for the S.& P. 500 in the range of 1,300 to 1,350 -- which represents a gain of roughly 20 percent from the current level.
He says that the market is likely to get there in the next few months -- but that stock prices will have then outstripped earnings, setting up investors for a fall.
"The current bull market is a lot older than it looks," he said. Sometime in 2010, he said, there is likely to be a correction -- a market decline of more than 10 percent, and probably in the range of 20 or 25 percent.
"Buy-and-hold investors may be willing to say, 'No big deal, I can ride a decline of that size out, considering the moves we've had in the last two years,' " Mr. Ramsey said. Still, he added, "another decline is going to really hurt" people who were stung by last year's losses and haven't rebalanced their portfolios.
This clouded outlook, even from market bulls, is in itself reason for optimism, in the contrarian view of Laszlo Birinyi Jr., president of Birinyi Associates, a stock market research firm in Westport, Conn. Mr. Birinyi predicted the onset of this bull market and remains convinced that it will continue for some time.
"I think that as far as the market goes, the negative case is always more articulate, more intelligent, more compelling, because it's focused on what you can see now -- on what's right in front of you," he said. "The market, meanwhile, is telling you what's ahead of you." That, he said, is probably a strong economy and rapidly growing corporate earnings.
Byron R. Wien, a Wall Street veteran who is now vice chairman of the Blackstone Group, has also been bullish for many months. Fundamentally, he said, the economy is recovering, credit markets are improving and earnings are beginning to rebound.
"The market is more likely to increase in value next year than decrease," he said. "It won't go up in a straight line, but I expect it will go up for several years."
After the run it's already had, though, Mr. Wien said that a short-term decline of 10 percent or more has become more likely. "A correction of some sort wouldn't be unexpected now," he said. "It could be a healthy thing."
Until now, the market rally has received considerable help from extraordinary government intervention in the credit markets and the economy. If the economy continues to grow, central banks, fearing inflation, are likely to tighten their monetary policy. In the United States, at some point in 2010, the Federal Reserve will begin "draining liquidity from the financial system, as opposed to the quantitative easing that we have seen," and interest rates will start to rise, said Barry Knapp, United States equity strategist at Barclays Capital.
The Fed's maneuver will be fraught with risk; if handled deftly, it will deal only a temporary setback to the stock market, he said.
Long-term Treasury yields are likely to rise, and bond prices, which move in the opposite direction, are likely to fall, many analysts say. "I would definitely avoid the Treasury market," Mr. Knapp said.
He predicted that there would probably be a stock market correction, then a resumption of the rally. When all is said and done, Barclays estimates that the S.& P. will stand at 1,120 at the end of 2010 -- not far from where it is now.
For this to happen, Mr. Knapp said, "the sectors that drove the market forward will have to change." Financial stocks will no longer lead the rally's next phase, he said.
Technology and industrial shares may do so ultimately, but in the short term, it may make sense to move into more "defensive" areas, like consumer staples and even health care. Impending federal health care legislation "isn't likely to have as negative an effect on this sector as the market has assumed," he said.
FOR his part, Mr. Birinyi said bets on broad sectors or on the overall market might not be as profitable in the coming months because so many people have already adopted the gospel of index mutual funds and exchange-traded funds.
Instead, Mr. Birinyi recommended "bottom-up stock-picking," citing an eclectic mix of industry "leaders," like Apple, Goldman Sachs, U.S. Steel, Oshkosh and Green Mountain as some of his current favorites.
Don't just stick to the domestic market, said Mr. Ramsey at the Leuthold Group. Investors would do well if they had some money in developed foreign markets, he said, where overall valuations are now significantly cheaper than in the United States.
In these markets, he said, "I think you've got a better chance for stronger growth."

Full text: FOR decades, the Reader's Digest Association owned one of the world's great corporate collections of fine art, and the good stuff was never stashed in a vault. It hung in the hallways and meeting rooms of the company's vast, collegiate-looking offices in this suburban hamlet about 40 miles north of Midtown Manhattan.
Paintings by Picasso, Monet, Degas, Matisse, Renoir and van Gogh -- museum-worthy decor was just another perk of working for a publishing phenomenon, one that sold millions of magazines and books a year, a readership rivaled only by the Bible. Although comparing sales of the scriptures to those of Reader's Digest has always been unfair, because, as The New Yorker noted in 1945, "the Bible had a head start."
The masterpieces are long gone, most sold at auction to raise millions of badly needed dollars. Now, two years after a private equity deal saddled Reader's Digest with $2.2 billion in debt, and three months after it filed for bankruptcy, the walls are dominated by inexpensive prints and lots of corporate propaganda.
That's right: corporate propaganda. Posters in the corridors of this mostly empty building trumpet something called the FACE plan, an acronym for fast, accountable, candid and engaged. One poster offers simplistic how-tos for running a meeting. ("Ensure that the right people are at the table.") Another is headed with the words "Vision Statement" and uses lots of empty white space to underscore the point: "We will create the world's largest multiplatform communities based on branded content."
That mantra, and all the posters, are the brainchild of Mary Berner, the kinetic former president of Fairchild Publications who landed here with the backing of Ripplewood Holdings, the Manhattan private equity firm that orchestrated the debt-fueled takeover of Reader's Digest.
Since March 2007, Ms. Berner has been reconfiguring the innards of the company -- and trying to overhaul its public image, too. If you hear "Reader's Digest" and think only of a cheery, waiting-room magazine -- the one with the jokes, the lists, and the homespun stories like "Nobody Cares About Grandfather's Clock but Grandma" -- well, Ms. Berner would like to have a word with you.
She would like you to know that Reader's Digest has modernized and, for the first time in its history, won the National Magazine Award this year, the industry's most coveted prize. (Recent articles have included "Disposable Income: How to Make a Quick Buck on the Treasures -- and Trash -- in Your Closets" and "Simple Till 6: An Eating Plan for Busy People.") And she would like you to know that said magazine is but a small part of a soon-to-be-renamed company, with a trove of Web sites (like AllRecipes.com) and magazines (like Every Day With Rachael Ray) that you probably didn't know it owned.
DNA, however, is hard to shake, and this is a far-from-ideal moment for media ventures of any size. As legacy print companies struggle for relevance and revenue in a Webcentric era, this is a reclamation project with some history and drama -- a towering brand, a balance sheet on fire, a decimated work force that will either pivot into the digital age or expire.
As Ms. Berner tries to persuade the world to rethink this company, she apparently also needs to re-educate employees. Much of her time and boundless intensity is spent prodding her staff out of its entrenched, slow-motion ways -- no easy task, given the eccentric and insular culture of this company, a legacy of the long stewardship of DeWitt and Lila Wallace, the Reader's Digest founders.
Beyond agitprop, Ms. Berner's continuing internal campaign has included some let's-put-on-a-show enthusiasm and some merciless cost-cutting. Lines of authority have also been redrawn, integrating the print and online realms. "Silo busting" is a phrase you hear a lot.
To lead this revolution, Ms. Berner has hired an impressively credentialed group of women to the company's top jobs, a coterie known around the building collectively as "the blondes." Strictly speaking, they're not all blonde, but they have brought high-heel chic to a place that resisted, or actively shunned, that style for a long time.
"It was hilarious to see all those Prada shoes on that campus," says Jackie Leo, the onetime editor in chief at Reader's Digest magazine whom Ms. Berner eventually replaced. "It's such a Manhattan group in such a suburban place."
They are leaving this suburban place soon. The company is gearing up to vacate the premises, 770,000 square feet of office space built by the Wallaces in 1939.
The move gets the company out from under an onerous lease. (The estate was sold in 2005, and Reader's Digest has since been a tenant.) But relocating is also a symbolic and definitive break with a past that seems awfully dowdy in the age of tweets. About half of the 900 remaining employees will work in an office in White Plains, and half will work in Midtown Manhattan.
A major makeover? That term isn't strong enough for what Ms. Berner and her team have in mind. This is more like entering the Witness Protection Program, surgically altering your face, then emerging with a new identity in a different country.
Bye-bye, Reader's Digest.
Hello "multibrand media and marketing company that educates, entertains and connects audiences around the world," as it says on another FACE poster.
"It's Herculean, what Mary is trying to do," says Samir Husni, a professor of journalism at the University of Mississippi. "She wants to keep Reader's Digest's original audience and add a whole new audience through new media."
Will it work? It's too soon to say, Professor Husni adds, "but so far, she and her team have at least stopped the bleeding."
BY all accounts, including her own, Ms. Berner has been a 50-volt shock to the Reader's Digest system. She has laid off one-quarter of the top 200 executives. She put ads on the back cover of the flagship magazine, long considered an ad-free zone. She refused to give out bonuses to staffers who hadn't earned them.
"When people didn't make their numbers, they were surprised when they didn't get a bonus," says Ms. Berner, sitting in her office one recent morning and sounding as though she is still bewildered. "I said: 'I don't get it. You didn't make your number!' "
Blond, petite and kind of preppy, Ms. Berner has one mode: brisk. She talks emphatically and quickly, like a chat-show host rushing to commercial break. She often starts to answer questions as soon as she gets their gist. Her idle is set very high.
In her telling, Reader's Digest was badly in need of a towel snap before she arrived. It was publicly traded at the time, and had almost $1 billion in debt, most of it from acquisitions, a few of which turned out to be real stinkers.
Ripplewood, led by Tim Collins, its chief executive, saw turnaround opportunities as well as a chance to roll up the fund's own media properties, including Time Life Inc., the direct-marketing company that was formerly part of Time Warner. Ripplewood put in $275 million of its own money and had a bunch of partners, which included Rothschild Bank of Zurich and GoldenTree Asset Management of New York.
But the $2.4 billion deal piled so much debt onto Reader's Digest's balance sheet that it tripled the company's interest payments, to $148 million a year. The Great Recession hurt ad sales, of course, and devastated sales of direct-marketed books. Instead of the single-digit percentage growth in revenue that Ripplewood was banking on, revenue declined.
In January, the company laid off 300 people, about 8 percent of its staff.
But even with those measures, the company did not, as Ms. Berner might put it, make its number. In August, it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
With the lenders' swapping debt for equity, Ripplewood lost its entire investment and was evicted like an overstretched homeowner. The purchase now has a prominent place in the annals of media buyout fiascoes -- not quite in the same category as Sam Zell's $8.5 billion purchase of the Tribune Company, but not far behind, either.
Mr. Collins declined to comment.
For Ms. Berner, who has earned favorable clippings in her years in the magazine business -- a profile in Folio was headlined "The Cult of Mary" -- the filing was a blow to a hearty ego.
"Not under my watch!" is how she sums up her initial reaction. But then her lawyers explained the financial benefits of a bankruptcy proceeding, and she says she warmed to the idea: "That is what got me to do it. The lawyers said: 'This is a great tool. This is what you should do.' "
She was the only member of the Ripplewood team who actually kept her job, and with a salary that even during the bankruptcy proceedings is a comfy $125,000 a month. (She was a consultant to Ripplewood, she notes for the record, never a full-time employee.) To add a hint of familial psychodrama to the episode, she had been introduced to Ripplewood by her younger brother, Rob Berner, who was then an executive with the company. (Mr. Berner wouldn't comment; a Reader's Digest spokesman says he left Ripplewood around the time of the deal.)
Ms. Berner would not discuss the state of her relationship with Ripplewood or her brother. Like a lot of subjects related to the bankruptcy, she explained that her lawyers had urged maximum discretion.
With her employees, she has spoken often and at length about Chapter 11 and her plans for the magazine's life during and after it. Bankruptcy represents a low point that would have been unimaginable in the heyday of this company, and a few employees have been around long enough to remember those years.
It was a time when this remote and now largely desolate building was the improbable setting for one of the greatest powerhouses in the history of publishing.
THE magazine was dreamed up by DeWitt Wallace, the son of a Greek and Latin scholar. He clipped, condensed and rewrote articles as he recovered from shrapnel wounds sustained in World War I. The original content aggregator, a kind of proto-Matt Drudge, the deeply conservative Mr. Wallace culled articles from the booming world of magazine publishing, mostly for rural readers who didn't have access to newsstands.
The emphasis was patriotism ("The End of Socialism in Russia"), health remedies, some tending toward quackery ("Found: A One Day Cure for Syphilis"), animal stories ("The Life of the Bee") and parental guides ("Marijuana -- Assassin of Youth"). Plus a lot of inspiring tales about regular people.
The Wallaces initially hoped to one day earn $5,000 a year with their pocket-size production, but Mr. Wallace's hunches about what mass-market audiences wanted were dead-on. By 1929, circulation stood at 290,000 subscribers and brought in $900,000 a year -- more than $11 million in inflation-adjusted dollars -- according to "American Dreamers," a book about the Wallaces. By the 40th anniversary of Reader's Digest, Time tallied up the magazine's achievements: 40 editions, in 13 languages and Braille, and the best-selling publication in Canada, Mexico, Spain, Sweden, Peru -- and on and on. Total worldwide circulation was 23 million.
Money poured in so fast that when the offices in nearby Pleasantville relocated to Chappaqua, the company kept the old address because Chappaqua's post office wasn't equipped for the onslaught of mail. The Wallaces, who never had children, didn't know what to do with all the cash. Growing up, Mr. Wallace had been sternly lectured by his father about frugality, and he was uncomfortable with the trappings of wealth.
So the Wallaces gave away their riches, not just through philanthropic donations but also in envelopes filled with cash and handed without warning to employees. They provided them with free bus service to nearby towns, and Mr. Wallace was known to flick the lights and shoo away anyone still toiling after the go-home chime of the 4 p.m. bell in the cupola.
There were surprise companywide raises, too. Al Perruzza, now a senior vice president, recalls a dinner in the early '70s at which Mr. Wallace rose, clanked a glass and announced that, effective Monday, everyone at Reader's Digest would get a 10 percent raise. He sat for a moment, conferred with Mrs. Wallace and then stood up again.
"My lovely wife doesn't think that's enough," he said. "So effective Monday, it's 15 percent."
He rose a third time and announced a cost-of-living increase.
"We had spent literally weeks preparing a budget," Mr. Perruzza says with a grin. "I was sitting with the president of my division. The guy went ashen."
Mr. Wallace died in 1981, and Mrs. Wallace in 1984. In 1990, the company went public, hoping to expand, to acquire and to kick-start some growth. The pitch to investors was that Reader's Digest was a prestige brand that had figured out the secret to direct-mail marketing.
The stock price would eventually triple, to just under $60, but in 2001, there were two disasters: the anthrax scare after the 9/11 attacks, which hurt any business that relied on the postal system, and an agreement that Reader's Digest signed with more than 30 attorneys general, who had long threatened litigation over allegedly misleading you-might-be-a-winner sweepstakes letters the company mass-mailed to drum up business. Reader's Digest began to phase out sweepstakes mailings in the United States.
"The amazing thing," says Dennis McAlpine, a retired media analyst who covered the company for years, "is that nobody in Reader's Digest went to management and said 'Don't sign that agreement because it will kill us.' Nobody seemed to know how much of an impact that agreement would have. But as soon as they stopped marketing with sweepstakes, everything went to hell."
AT its peak, about 3,500 people worked at the Reader's Digest headquarters. With night shifts for blue-collar production jobs, the place hummed 24 hours a day. When zoning restrictions barred the company from adding floors above, it dug down and added office space below.
Walking the hallways now, it's hard to imagine the bustle. More than half of the building is empty, a ghostly warren of empty cubicles and unused bathrooms. You can walk for long stretches without seeing anyone. A stand-alone brick addition has been condemned because of mold, a company spokesman said.
The new Manhattan offices have a contemporary and more generic feel. Last week, Ms. Berner offered a walk-through of the place, a couple of floors in a building on Third Avenue at 46th Street, the former home of some bridal magazines owned by Conde Nast. Much of it is a wide-open room, filled with phones and desks and, when the employees move in, it will have a work din that Chappaqua has long been lacking.
"The building is the last barrier," Ms. Berner says. "It's the last thing that is emblematic of the old strategy."
Suzanne Grimes, a former publisher of Glamour who is now in charge of all food- and entertainment-related content at the Reader's Digest Association, has an equally gung-ho view of the company's future. She works in DeWitt Wallace's former office, and she is dressed this afternoon in what appears to be a black, one-piece jumpsuit, like Catwoman in business casual.
She is sitting at a table strewn with magazines. There's A Taste of Home, with a circulation of 3.2 million and a readership that contributes all the recipes; a handful of Taste of Home offshoots, like Simple & Delicious andHealthy Cooking; a few issues of Every Day With Rachael Ray; and several cookbooks.
Altogether, Ms. Grimes says, she has an audience of 88 million.
"We're masterful at repurposing content," she says. "We have a woman who submitted a cookie recipe. It was deemed the best recipe to come through." It ran in that issue of A Taste of Home "as a contest winner, ran in a cookie special, ran in a holiday special," she adds.
Since food and entertaining properties were brought together as an "affinity group" under Ms. Grimes in 2007, advertising for them is up 73 percent, she says.
There have been setbacks along with such gains. Most notably, there was a short-lived partnership with the megachurch evangelist and best-selling author Rick Warren on a magazine called Purpose Driven Connection. The company pulled the plug after four issues. And expansion plans for magazine and book businesses have slowed.
Reader's Digest has pared back to 10 issues a year from 12. From a peak in the '70s of 17 million subscribers in the United States, the magazine currently has a circulation of 8 million and will lower its guaranteed circulation next year to 5.5 million.
Through all the bumps, Ms. Berner has tried to encourage her staff to talk, vent and criticize freely -- a change, she says, from longstanding practice.
"People would say, 'Oh you're so fabulous,' " she recalls, referring to visits to her office, "then walk outside and say, 'She's such a bitch.' "
Ms. Berner allowed this reporter to sit in at a regular employee breakfast get-together one recent morning, on the condition that no employees be identified by name. The conversation loosened up a bit after she left for a meeting.
"It was kind of a boys' club," one employee said, describing the culture before Ms. Berner and her team arrived.
"Now it's a girls' club," said another.
"Blond girls!" said a third.
"There have been a few complaints about the blond girl thing."
This staffer, a woman, went on.
"When the FACE thing came out we're like: 'We've heard it. We've been there. We've heard all the acronyms.' But she's very serious; she's very dedicated to pushing through that. I finally gave up the thinking that this was just another set of words that wouldn't ever pan out."
FORGET about the FACE plan. Will this company pan out?
"It depends on how much time they have, and that depends on how much the new creditors trust Mary," says Steve Cohn, editor of Media Industry Newsletter. "Given that some of the old creditors got pennies on the dollar, I would think the company is on a tight leash right now -- the equivalent of severe probation."
It's been a long slide downhill. Reader's Digest was long run with the sort of erratic beneficence that drives bean counters insane, in large part because the Wallaces always thought of their business as a kind of educational foundation that happened to be spectacularly lucrative. That's why Mr. Wallace constantly pushed back when underlings came up with the new ways to goose revenue that were primarily about goosing revenue.
We know the rest of the story: In search of growth, the company goes public, stalls and then gasps for life when a hedge fund loads a couple billion dollars' worth of debt onto its back. The Reader's Digest Association may or may not survive in the transformed shape that Mary Berner envisions, but as a business school case study, it's already a lesson for the ages.

Full text: For weeks this movie capital has crackled with speculation on a lone topic: Will James Cameron's "Avatar," one of the biggest motion pictures -- in budget and scope -- ever made, soar or sputter at the box office?
The first multiplex tea leaves for the movie arrived on Friday morning. In midnight screenings "Avatar," a futuristic 3-D spectacle about love and war set on a distant moon, sold about $3.5 million in tickets at theaters in the United States and Canada, said 20th Century Fox, the studio behind the film.
That total is on a par with movies that are not built around pre-existing brands. But it falls short of expectations for such a buzzed-about picture, given its higher 3-D ticket prices, positive reviews and Mr. Cameron's resume.
"The midnights are not what some people dreamed they might be, but they are totally fine," said Paul Dergarabedian, president of the box office division of Hollywood.com, a tracking service. "This is a long-term play."
Fox says it expects "Avatar" to gross between $50 million and $60 million for the weekend in North America, with more than 100 foreign countries easily bringing in $100 million more. The studio was concerned on Friday that a major snowstorm forecast this weekend for the East Coast could keep moviegoers at home.
It is a frequent Hollywood practice, of course, to tamp down expectations by low-balling estimates. Film executives dread Monday headlines about softer-than-anticipated opening weekends, especially for Christmas movies, which historically hold up better than summer blockbusters in subsequent weekends.
Industry expectations for "Avatar" are much higher. Rival studios say that audience-tracking surveys indicate that weekend ticket sales in North America will total about $80 million. The film is playing in 3,452 theaters, about 60 percent of which are charging an additional $3 to $5 for the 3-D presentation.
"I Am Legend," the post-apocalyptic Will Smith picture from 2007, holds the record for a December opening weekend with $77.2 million. It went on to sell $585.3 million in tickets at the global box office.
How many tickets "Avatar" will sell is no small question for Fox and its financing partners, Dune Entertainment and Ingenious Film Partners. "Avatar" cost Fox around $310 million to produce -- although tax credits will shave about $30 million off that bill -- and an estimated $150 million to market.
To what degree word of mouth and positive reviews will push up the sales total is still unknown. A burst of upbeat chatter appeared on social-networking Web sites after the midnight shows. And critics have cheered the film with a voraciousness rarely seen for effects-driven extravaganzas; more than 90 percent of top critics have given "Avatar" positive marks, according to the review aggregation site Rottentomatoes.com.
"Avatar" has presented Fox with many marketing headaches. Initial reaction to a conventional trailer was flat, and response to a 3-D Imax preview provoked doubts about whether the picture was really a cinematic game-changer.
To succeed "Avatar" needs to attract moviegoers of all ages. Advance ticket sales have been strong, particularly among older men, but younger audiences -- notably teenage girls -- appear more skeptical. Online ticket sellers like Fandango.com say advance interest in "Avatar" has been stronger than for some recent blockbusters, among them "Star Trek" and "2012." But it is lagging behind the year's big sequels, including "Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen."
Expectations are also high for "Avatar" because it is Mr. Cameron's first feature film since the Oscar-winning "Titanic," which opened in 1997 and became one of the best-selling movies in history.
Fox can take comfort in knowing that for its opening weekend, "Titanic" brought in just $45 million, when adjusted for inflation, and it went on to make $1.8 billion at the worldwide box office.

Full text: SOMETIMES economies can be too good.
That is one lesson from the history of a new "misery index," created by Pierre Cailleteau, an economist and sovereign risk analyst at Moody's.
The index adds together a country's budget deficit, as a percentage of gross domestic product, and its unemployment rate. It captures the current conundrum for many countries: their economies need stimulus, but their budgets may not be able to afford it.
The unfortunate leader in that misery index among the countries cited by Moody's is Spain, with an index of 30, thanks to an unemployment rate of 20 percent and a deficit of 10 percent of G.D.P. The figures are Moody's estimates for 2010.
While Spain is extreme, the indexes are high for many countries, with the United States and Britain both expected to score over 20 next year.
In 2005, as can be seen in the accompanying graphic featuring 13 European countries and the United States and Iceland, the two countries with the highest misery indexes were Hungary and Greece, at 15.1, or just more than half Spain's current figure. In 2010, only three countries are expected to be lower than 15.1 -- the Czech Republic, Germany and Italy.
In the glory days for the world economy, when no one would have thought to put together this index, two countries managed to have negative figures, which can happen if budget surpluses are large and unemployment rates are minuscule.
Iceland, whose economy was once viewed as a testament to the strength that could come if a country cultivated a strong and expanding financial industry, had a negative misery index in 2000 and again from 2005 through 2007.
Ireland, which also had a growing banking system and seemed to have positioned itself as the economic star of the euro zone, had an index reading of less than 5 for nine consecutive years, from 1999 to 2007, including a negative reading in 2000.
Those countries have been among the worst hit by the financial crisis. Both had property booms that left prices dangerously overextended, and both have been forced to sharply cut government spending despite rising unemployment.
The original misery index, created by the economist Arthur M. Okun, added together a country's unemployment rate and its inflation rate. That index came to symbolize stagflation, a significant problem of the 1970s, when consumer prices continued to rise even as economies stagnated and unemployment rose.
The new index could prove to be an indicator of the dilemma facing many developed countries in coming years. If economies do not recover quickly, there will a strong case for fiscal stimulus to bring down unemployment. But there are limits to the budget deficits that some countries can run, providing a counterargument against such stimulus.
A lesson of the stagflation era -- one taught by Paul A. Volcker in the United States -- was that countries sometimes had to get inflation under control even if it did prolong economic pain and raise unemployment. It would have been much better, in the long run, if inflation had been attacked earlier.
This new misery index serves to highlight the risks the world took by not being afraid of the inflation of recent years -- inflation not in consumer prices but in real estate and financial assets. Instead, gains in those areas were taken as proof of excellent economic policies. Now, the world is paying for that excess, and finding the price to be high.

Full text: The first reason to support the Senate health care bill is that it would provide insurance to 30 million more Americans.
The second reason to support the bill is that its authors took the deficit issue seriously. Compared with, say, the prescription drug benefit from a few years ago, this bill is a model of fiscal rectitude. It spends a lot of money to cover the uninsured, but to help pay for it, it also includes serious Medicare cuts and whopping tax increases -- the tax on high-cost insurance plans alone will raise $1.3 trillion in the second decade.
The bill is not really deficit-neutral. It's politically inconceivable that Congress will really make all the spending cuts that are there on paper. But the bill won't explode the deficit, and that's an accomplishment.
The third reason to support the bill is that the authors have thrown in a million little ideas in an effort to reduce health care inflation. The fact is, nobody knows how to reduce cost growth within the current system. The authors of this bill are willing to try anything. You might even call this a Burkean approach. They are not fundamentally disrupting the status quo, but they are experimenting with dozens of gradual programs that might bend the cost curve.
If you've ever heard about it, it's in there -- improved insurance exchanges, payment innovations, an independent commission to cap Medicare payment rates, an innovation center, comparative effectiveness research. There's at least a pilot program for every promising idea.
The fourth reason to support the bill is that if this fails, it will take a long time to get back to health reform. Clinton failed. Obama will have failed. No one will touch this. Meanwhile, health costs will continue their inexorable march upward, strangling the nation.
The first reason to oppose this bill is that it does not fundamentally reform health care. The current system is rotten to the bone with opaque pricing and insane incentives. Consumers are insulated from the costs of their decisions and providers are punished for efficiency. Burkean gradualism is fine if you've got a cold. But if you've got cancer, you want surgery, not nasal spray.
If this bill passes, you'll have 500 experts in Washington trying to hold down costs and 300 million Americans with the same old incentives to get more and more care. The Congressional Budget Office and most of the experts I talk to (including many who support the bill) do not believe it will seriously bend the cost curve.
The second reason to oppose this bill is that, according to the chief actuary for Medicare, it will cause national health care spending to increase faster. Health care spending is already zooming past 17 percent of G.D.P. to 22 percent and beyond. If these pressures mount even faster, health care will squeeze out everything else, especially on the state level. We'll shovel more money into insurance companies and you can kiss goodbye programs like expanded preschool that would have a bigger social impact.
Third, if passed, the bill sets up a politically unsustainable situation. Over its first several years, the demand for health care will rise sharply. The supply will not. Providers will have the same perverse incentives. As a result, prices will skyrocket while efficiencies will not. There will be a bipartisan rush to gut reform.
This country has reduced health inflation in short bursts, but it has not sustained cost control over the long term because the deep flaws in the system produce horrific political pressures that gut restraint.
Fourth, you can't centrally regulate 17 percent of the U.S. economy without a raft of unintended consequences.
Fifth, it will slow innovation. Government regulators don't do well with disruptive new technologies.
Sixth, if this passes, we will never get back to cost control. The basic political deal was, we get to have dessert (expanding coverage) but we have to eat our spinach (cost control), too. If we eat dessert now, we'll never come back to the spinach.
So what's my verdict? I have to confess, I flip-flop week to week and day to day. It's a guess. Does this put us on a path toward the real reform, or does it head us down a valley in which real reform will be less likely?
If I were a senator forced to vote today, I'd vote no. If you pass a health care bill without systemic incentives reform, you set up a political vortex in which the few good parts of the bill will get stripped out and the expensive and wasteful parts will be entrenched.
Defenders say we can't do real reform because the politics won't allow it. The truth is the reverse. Unless you get the fundamental incentives right, the politics will be terrible forever and ever.

Full text: People who lie to join a club may not prove to be very good members.
That is one lesson of the current fiscal mess in Greece, where there are -- again -- fears that the country will be unable to pay its debts.
Those particular worries are almost certainly overdone, at least for the near term. But Greece is suffering mightily from having joined the euro zone -- something it was able to do only because it used what could kindly be called creative accounting to get its budget deficits down far enough to qualify a decade ago.
To be sure, there are unquestioned benefits for Greece from the euro. Interest rates are far lower than they would otherwise be, even if they have risen during the financial crisis. Having one currency for much of Europe facilitates tourism and encourages trade.
But Greece, like Italy, has lost competitiveness within the euro zone -- so much that two bond rating agencies have reduced the country's rating and a third, Moody's, says it may follow suit. Inflation has been higher than in other parts of the euro zone, and the country finds it hard to match prices of other exporters. Moreover, notes Arnaud Mares, an analyst at Moody's, the country has a reputation for having a slow and expensive bureaucracy that makes it costly and difficult to do business in the country.
If Greece still had its own currency, it would have chosen, or been forced, to devalue, and thereby gotten a quick boost to competitiveness, albeit at the cost of raising inflation as imported goods would have cost more. But that is not possible within the euro zone.
The euro remains a great experiment. Can a common currency exist forever without political union? Will its existence provide the impetus for needed reforms? Or will countries get into the same problems they used to get into, but without the safety valve of currency adjustments?
Those issues were all understood when the euro was created. Some hoped it would lead to political union. Others hoped it would force countries like Greece and Italy to keep their fiscal houses in order and to introduce reforms to make their economies more efficient and competitive.
So far, little of that has happened. Germany has sent conflicting signals about whether, in the end, it would bail out a fellow euro country, but since Greek bonds can be used as collateral for loans at the European Central Bank, there is at least some institutional support.
Still, worries about Greece have helped to renew fears of contagion in other parts of Europe where foreign exchange reserves are scarce and debts are high.
The comfortable belief that the world weathered the storms of 2008 and is now recovering could be challenged by a new wave of defaults.
At a minimum, we are being reminded that an incredible amount of capital was simply wasted during the late boom, whether in American commercial real estate or Middle Eastern skyscrapers, and a lot of those losses have yet to be realized. Dubai may yet replace Iceland as the record holder for capital destruction, measured on a per capita basis. Unfortunately, Greece, like a number of other countries, has proved to be much better at announcing economic reforms than at putting them into effect.
In a major speech this week, Greece's new prime minister, George A. Papandreou, promised economic changes. But Mr. Papandreou, who is the head of Greece's Socialist party and the president of Socialist International, a grouping of national Socialist parties, did not follow what has become the standard of comparison for euro countries in trouble: unlike Ireland, he did not promise to cut the pay of civil servants.
Instead, he said he would rely on attrition, hiring only one new civil servant for every five who retired. He promised that civil-service salaries would not be reduced, and that lower-level employees would get raises to offset inflation.
Euro countries are supposed to maintain budget deficits of less than 3 percent of G.D.P. -- something that Greece did not do in the late 1990s but said it did in order to join the euro club. Mr. Papandreou promised to meet that goal, but not until 2013. Moody's estimates the deficit will be above 12 percent in 2010.
Still, the speech included some parts that seemed remarkable given the times and the speaker.
"We must change or sink," he said. "Our biggest deficit is the deficit of credibility. Markets want to see action, not words."
Here is a Socialist speaking after a world crisis that is generally blamed on capitalist excesses, citing the international market as requiring sacrifices at home.
Mr. Papandreou became prime minister only this fall, and so bears little responsibility for recent decisions. But he is hardly a new face, having served as education minister and foreign minister in the 1980s and 1990s.
And he is certainly not a new name. By Papandreou standards, not even the Bush family of the United States -- with one senator and two presidents over three generations -- can compare.
His grandfather, also named George, was prime minister of Greece three times, the first term beginning in 1944 and the last one ending in 1965. Two years later, a military coup overthrew the civilian government and he was put under house arrest. He died in 1968.
The current prime minister's father, Andreas, was thrown in prison by the colonels who carried out the coup. A former chairman of the economics department at the University of California, Berkeley, he was released to go into exile after the American government applied pressure on the junta. He returned after the military government was overthrown and served two stints as prime minister.
Thus a Papandreou was Greek prime minister in the '40s, '60s, '80s, '90s and now in the '00s, or whatever this decade should be called.
As such the family bears more than a little responsibility for the course of Greek democracy, in which government payrolls have often risen to deal with any social unrest.
In his speech this week, Mr. Papandreou said "the state is hostage to vested interests that hamper the fair management of state funding," and vowed "to clash with these interests."
There is more than a little doubt he can, or will, do so. Mr. Mares, the Moody's analyst, pointed out that the previous government promised to hire one person for every two who left. "Instead," he said, "in 2009 there were two hired for every one that retired."
The bond market is again voicing doubt, with Greek bonds trading at a yield premium of more than two percentage points over German bonds. In the heady days of 2005, that margin almost vanished.
That costs Greece money when it borrows, and makes it even harder to get the budget under control. As with many countries, it has a public pension system with major problems. But it cannot make a new start by devaluing its currency, and it is unwilling to impose salary cuts.
If this Papandreou can deliver on the changes he is promising, he will become by far the most successful prime minister in his family, if not in Greek history.

Abstract: On Tuesday, a report on producer prices showed unexpected gains in wholesale prices because of high energy costs, which economists expect to subside in the months ahead.

Full text: Builders broke ground on homes at a faster rate in November, the government said Wednesday, offering some hope that construction would continue to grow modestly and help stimulate the broader economy.
Home construction increased to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 574,000, the Commerce Department said, up 8.9 percent from October. Analysts attributed the increase to unexpectedly warm and dry weather in November after an unusually cold and wet October.
The number of building permits, an indicator of future construction that is not influenced by weather, rose 6 percent in November, reaching the highest level in a year after declining in October. Apartment construction, which remains in a deep slump, backed off slightly from a 40-year low, reaching an annual rate of 92,000. Single-family home construction grew 2.1 percent.
Thomas A. Lawler, founder of Lawler Economic and Housing Consulting in Virginia, said construction was still proceeding at a relatively slow pace, which he said was encouraging because it would allow vacant homes already on the market to be sold.
"Everyone still agrees that there is a disturbingly high level of vacant homes still on the market," Mr. Lawler said. "The best thing that can happen would be a continued subdued pace of construction."
Economists expect demand for homes to remain at modest levels through the spring, propped up by a government tax credit of up to $8,000 for first-time buyers, which expires in April.
Home construction has a powerful ricochet effect through the economy. After a house is sold, consumers typically need refrigerators, appliances and furniture. Some economists estimate that construction alone will add 0.5 percent to gross domestic product in the fourth quarter.
A separate report released Wednesday showed that inflation appeared to be largely under control: consumer prices, excluding volatile food and energy costs, remained virtually unchanged in November. Declining rents helped offset an increase in the price of cars, tobacco and airline tickets.
When food and energy were added, the Consumer Price Index rose 0.4 percent in November, largely because of a 6.4 percent jump in gasoline prices and a 7.3 percent rise in oil prices. On Tuesday, a report on producer prices showed unexpected gains in wholesale prices because of high energy costs, which economists expect to subside in the months ahead.
Compared with a year ago, consumer prices were up 1.8 percent.
Even as prices show small increases, the Federal Reserve, the nation's central bank, remains unconcerned about inflation. On Wednesday, the Fed reiterated its promise to keep interest rates low for an "extended period," saying inflation would "remain subdued for some time."
Still, companies are finding it difficult to pass along higher prices to consumers, given high unemployment and idle production capability. On Tuesday, Best Buy, for instance, said its profit margins would fall during the holiday season because of deeply discounted computers and televisions.
"When you've got wild unemployment around the world, and very low capacity utilization, it's a real competition to get people to buy your products and you compete for lower prices," said Robert J. Barbera, chief economist for ITG. "It's hard to tell an inflation story with that kind of excess capacity."
A third report released Wednesday showed the current-account deficit rising in the United States because of an increase in oil imports and industrial goods in the third quarter. The deficit widened to $108 billion in the third quarter, an increase of 10.3 percent from the previous quarter, the Commerce Department said.

Full text: The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, in a response to a lawmaker's questions made public Tuesday, said the United States economy was operating so far beneath its potential that inflation was unlikely to become a problem.
The response was to a question asked by Senator Jim Bunning, a Republican from Kentucky, at Mr. Bernanke's confirmation hearing for a second term.
In the hearing before the Senate Banking Committee earlier this month, Mr. Bernanke came under fire both for failing to prevent the financial crisis and for overextending the central bank in an attempt to ease the banking sector's strains.
Mr. Bernanke, in a written response received by Mr. Bunning's office on Monday, said high unemployment and idle factory capacity made it unlikely that inflation would post a rapid increase any time soon.
"The bulk of the evidence indicates that resource slack is now substantial," Mr. Bernanke wrote. His response was posted on Mr. Bunning's Web site.
"I continue to expect slack resources, together with the stability of inflation expectations, to contribute to the maintenance of low inflation in the period ahead," he said.
The latest figures on producer prices outside the volatile food and energy sectors, published by the Labor Department on Tuesday, showed a surprising 0.5 percent spike, prompting a sell-off in both stocks and government bonds on inflation fears.
Asked about market gyrations, Mr. Bernanke argued that the recent rise in gold prices, which have surged to above $1,200 an ounce, were not a sign of increasing inflation expectations.
He also said he saw no sign of a bubble in the stock market, which has gained more than 60 percent from its March lows.
The Senate Banking Committee will vote on the nomination of Mr. Bernanke to a second four-year term on Thursday, the panel said on Tuesday. If the committee approves Mr. Bernanke, his nomination will be considered by the full Senate.

Full text: The bond vigilantes are back.
But this time they are roaming mostly through Europe rather than the United States -- at least for now. Their mission: to force governments to cut budget deficits that have ballooned in the wake of the financial crisis.
As big investors in the credit markets, activist bond traders developed a fearsome reputation in the early 1990s by pushing up yields on Treasuries in order to force the government to tame large deficits. Their most famous target was a newly elected president, Bill Clinton, whom they pressured to abandon campaign promises of tax cuts.
Today, the bond market posse has set its sights on Europe -- particularly Britain and Greece -- where stagnant economies and high levels of government spending have led to the highest budget deficits in the region.
Although the left-leaning governments in both countries are struggling to show investors that they have a workable plan to reduce deficits -- which now average around 13 percent of gross domestic product -- bond traders are increasingly demanding higher interest rates to reflect the rising risks.
Bond traders last week pushed the spreads between Greek 10-year bonds and their benchmark German counterparts -- a measure of investor confidence in the country -- to highs of 250 basis points after the nation's credit rating was downgraded, raising concerns over Greece's ability to service its enormous debt.
In Britain, where the nation's economy and finances have fallen so sharply that investors fear a possible downgrade of the country's triple-A rating, bond traders are also taking a hard line. Last week, yields on gilts were pushed to their highest levels since the depths of the financial crisis, after the Labour Party issued a preliminary budget report that skimped on details of spending cuts.
"There is a clear drop in confidence on the part of bond investors," said Mark Schofield, a fixed-income strategist at Citigroup in London. "I think it is all beginning to unravel."
The power of the bond trader to influence governments once prompted James Carville, Mr. Clinton's political strategist at the time, to say that he wished to be reincarnated as one because "you can intimidate everybody."
Mr. Clinton may not have been intimidated, but he did heed the advice of Robert Rubin, who joined the administration from his post at the top of Goldman Sachs, that a policy of budgetary restraint would keep the bond market happy and interest rates on United States government bonds low.
Since then, the vigilantes have been largely in abeyance: As the global economy boomed, public sector deficits were not a concern for investors.
All that changed rapidly with the onset of the credit crisis last year. Bond traders surfed the global liquidity wave, buying up government debt all over the world in the view that, just as most big banks were too big to fail, so were sovereign economies, no matter how crushing their fiscal picture.
But Dubai World's recent decision to delay payment on its debt has brought the crisis to reality for complacent bondholders. They have begun to demand that governments with large budget gaps start to pay higher interest rates on their bonds to reflect rising sovereign risk -- a development that will lead to higher borrowing costs in countries like Britain, Greece, Ireland and Spain.
The United States and Japan also face unusually high debt levels, deepened by huge stimulus programs. For the time being, investors are still willing to lend to them at generous rates. But bondholders are running out of patience as the finances of even the wealthiest nations spiral downward.
As bond investors become more impatient, some European countries have taken aggressive fiscal action.
In Ireland, the government this month presented the most severe budget in the nation's history, largely to prove to wary bond investors that it was serious about cutting its own deficit.
"There is a greater market focus now on who the fiscally vulnerable countries are," said Michael Saunders, the head of European economics at Citigroup.
Britain falls into that category, he said, because the British Labour government, led by Prime Minister Gordon Brown, is facing a difficult election battle and appears more concerned with pleasing voters than investors. That could lead to a bond market rout if gilt holders, a large proportion of them foreign, come to the conclusion that cutting the deficit is not a top priority, he said.
In the euro zone, the European Central Bank's interest in keeping inflation low means that it is likely to maintain a stable euro, leaving smaller European economies with no opportunity for a cheaper currency to help generate growth from exports.
As a result, governments in Portugal, Ireland, Greece and Spain have had to turn to increasingly skeptical bond markets to raise funds while waiting for their economies to recover through the far more painful process of squeezing wages and shedding jobs to restore competitiveness.
A recent report from Standard Chartered even suggested that weak euro members like Greece and Ireland might reconsider their ties to the union if investors pulled the plug and stopped refinancing their countries' debts.
"The idea that currency unions can't break up is rubbish," said Tim Congdon, an economist and professed euro skeptic who has advised Conservative governments in Britain. "The critical issue is whether governments can repay their debts in new currencies or euros once they leave."
If they can pay back bond investors in new and cheaper currencies, then it is in the interests of countries like Greece to go out on their own, Mr. Congdon said.
But with other countries seeking the shelter of the euro and leaders like Angela Merkel of Germany hinting that the big powers would come to the rescue of Greece and other distressed countries if necessary, most economists argue that the euro zone is unlikely to crack.
Still, that has not stopped bond investors from talking up a new divergence trade in Europe -- the flip side to the convergence trade earlier this decade, during which Irish, Greek and Spanish government bonds were bought on the theory that a grand economic harmony would sweep Europe.

Abstract: [...] a group of freshman Democratic senators has proposed an amendment that includes an array of changes meant to further reduce health care spending, including added authority for a new commission charged with identifying savings in Medicare. While Mr. Reid has made no public statement, it is clear that the final Senate bill will include robust provisions to help small businesses afford benefits for their workers, enhanced tax breaks and reduced penalties if they fail to meet new mandates.

Full text: It's crunch time.
As Senate Democrats await new cost projections from the Congressional Budget Office on their latest effort to settle the major internal disagreements over the health care legislation, they are also positioning themselves for a lightning-quick dash to the finish.
"There's not much time left," said Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon. "Right now, you are at the crucial hour. It's the part of the game when you have got it on the line."
The big sticking point has been over a proposed government-run insurance plan, or public option. The budget office is analyzing a compromise idea to create at least two national health plans modeled after those for federal workers and members of Congress.
If the cost figures are on target -- and Democrats can iron out new disagreements, including those over a companion proposal to allow some people ages 55 to 64 to buy coverage through Medicare -- the majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, is expected to push quickly to end debate and hold final votes.
And the legislative process, which seemed to bog down repeatedly over the last two weeks of nonstop floor debate, could suddenly end up finished in a breathless blur. Beyond the public option, here are other unresolved issues to keep an eye on.
ABORTION Senate Democrats worked through the weekend to hammer out a deal over the divisive issue of insurance coverage for abortions. The goal on all sides is to remain consistent with existing law and prevent federal money from paying for abortions.
The House-passed health care bill includes tight restrictions, barring abortion coverage in any health plan that is even partly paid for with new federal subsidies to help people afford insurance. The Senate rejected a proposal to adopt that language.
Ever since, Democratic leaders have tried to chart a middle course that would satisfy opponents of abortion rights, most importantly Senator Ben Nelson, Democrat of Nebraska, without angering abortion rights supporters who oppose any new restrictions.
COST CONTAINMENT Democrats face a barrage of Republican criticism over the cost of the bill, and the outcry grew louder last week when the chief actuary of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said the bill would increase overall health spending.
Senators Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut, and Arlen Specter, Democrat of Pennsylvania, have put forward an amendment that would speed up the starting date of provisions aimed at lowering costs.
This self-proclaimed tripartisan group has proposed that new penalties on hospitals over preventable infections begin in 2013 rather than 2015 and that a new pilot program to "bundle" Medicare payments to hospitals begin by Jan. 1, 2012, not 2013.
In addition, a group of freshman Democratic senators has proposed an amendment that includes an array of changes meant to further reduce health care spending, including added authority for a new commission charged with identifying savings in Medicare.
SMALL BUSINESS America's small businesses have some powerful advocates: Senators Olympia J. Snowe, Republican of Maine; Mary L. Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana; and Blanche Lincoln, Democrat of Arkansas. The White House is courting all those votes.
On Wednesday, Mrs. Lincoln and Ms. Landrieu held a news conference to unveil a package of amendments intended to help small businesses. Ms. Snowe has had several meetings at the White House where she conveyed her views directly to President Obama.
While Mr. Reid has made no public statement, it is clear that the final Senate bill will include robust provisions to help small businesses afford benefits for their workers, enhanced tax breaks and reduced penalties if they fail to meet new mandates.
CADILLAC TAX The Senate bill includes a 40 percent excise tax on high-priced health insurance policies. The tax would apply to the price of self-only policies above $8,500 and to family policies above $23,000, in an effort to rein in runaway spending.
The White House has identified this proposal as a crucial component of the health legislation, and economists say it may be the one provision that takes a step toward controlling medical inflation. Mr. Reid has already weakened it and may do so again.
The original proposal, approved by the Senate Finance Committee, had set lower thresholds -- $8,000 for individuals and $21,000 for families. But an amendment put forward by Northern liberals seeks to raise the thresholds to $9,500 and $25,000.
Organized labor, an important Democratic constituency, opposes the excise tax because it will hit some generous union health plans. House Democrats did not include the tax in their health care bill, even though Mr. Obama has endorsed the idea.
Whether Mr. Reid holds firm will be a crucial test of his commitment to the goal of slowing the upward spiral of the nation's medical spending.
CHILDREN Children's health is a top priority for two important Democrats, Senators John D. Rockefeller IV of West Virginia and Bob Casey of Pennsylvania. Mr. Rockefeller is a strong voice for liberals; Mr. Casey will be central to a deal on abortion.
Both Mr. Casey and Mr. Rockefeller have fought to maintain the existing Children's Health Insurance Program.
"I have said from the beginning of this debate, and even before the debate began many months ago, that the standard ought to be four words: no child worse off," Mr. Casey said in a floor speech. "I think it is a standard we can meet."
Mr. Casey and Mr. Rockefeller have pressed for government financing for the program through 2015 -- a two-year extension from current law. Depending on the budget office analysis, the cost could prove to be prohibitive. If so, Mr. Reid may look to strike a deal.
CHOICE Senators Wyden and Collins and Senator Evan Bayh, Democrat of Indiana, have put forward amendments aimed at increasing health insurance choices across the board.
The latest Democratic compromise, to create national nonprofit plans like those offered to federal employees, moves in that direction. But Mr. Wyden wants to do more for people who struggle to afford benefits offered by their employers.

China Is Thriving, Its Economic Data Shows

Full text: Data released by China on Friday provided fresh evidence that the nation's economic recovery was gaining momentum, helped by government stimulus measures and lending by state-run banks over the last year.
China's authorities were quick to prime the economy in the wake of last year's global financial crisis, and gross domestic product is forecast to grow more than 8 percent this year -- vastly more than in the United States, Europe or Japan -- despite a sharp decline in exports.
On Friday, data for November showed industrial output soared 19.2 percent from a year ago, while imports jumped 26.7 percent. Exports were 1.2 percent below those of November 2008, but that shortfall was slight compared with the year-over-year declines of more than 10 percent in previous months.
Much of the increases now appearing in year-on-year economic statistics worldwide compare well to grim year-earlier figures, but often still remain well below precrisis levels.
China's exports, for example, totaled $113.7 billion in November, and imports were $94.6 billion. That is below the levels of $134.9 billion and $106.2 billion, respectively, recorded in August 2008, before Lehman Brothers collapsed.
"China's continued strong year-on-year monthly data released today were largely driven by base effects," said Li-Gang Liu, China economist at ANZ in Hong Kong. "November 2008 was the second consecutive month that most of these indicators experienced significant declines after the eruption of the global financial crisis. On a month-on-month basis, growth momentum remained steady."
Still, the output and import data released Friday exceeded analysts' expectations and showed that domestic demand was firmer than many had projected. Retail sales climbed 15.8 percent over a year earlier, only slightly less than in October. Inflation has begun to emerge as a result: consumer prices rose 0.6 percent in November, the first increase since January.
The surge in imports, fueled by the government spending and China's huge appetite for commodities, has caused the nation's trade surplus to shrink, to $19.1 billion in November from $24 billion in October. Some analysts say they believe China could even post a trade deficit next year.
"Trade deficits are inevitable," economists at Societe Generale said in a report presented on Thursday in Hong Kong. "The price of China's exports should remain relatively stable in 2010 and 2011 whilst the price of China's imports should pick up dramatically."
Amid mounting signs that the government-led spending boom could worsen overcapacity in the industrial sector, Beijing has begun to rein in some stimulus measures, albeit very carefully.
Bank lending in November, for example, nudged up to 294.8 billion renminbi ($43.2 billion) from 253 billion renminbi in October, but was well below levels seen earlier this year. The authorities have taken several steps -- scrapping tax breaks, for instance -- to curb ballooning property prices.
Beijing remains concerned about the sustainability of growth, and most China watchers do not expect Beijing to raise interest rates outright or to allow the renminbi to strengthen against the dollar until well into next year.

Strong Sales At Retailers Raise Hopes For Growth

Abstract: The rosy numbers brought the Dow Jones industrial average up to within a point of its highest level in more than a year, as investors grew more confident that companies would be reaping better-than-expected profits this holiday season.

Full text: A strong start to the holiday shopping season pushed retail sales higher in November, the government reported on Friday, propelling stock prices near their recent highs.
Hopes that consumers may be opening their wallets ever so slightly even in this grim job market were also bolstered by a separate report that showed consumer confidence improving.
In retailers as diverse as health stores and electronics boutiques, sales rose 1.3 percent last month from October, nearly twice the gain economists had expected. Excluding cars and gasoline sales, which can be volatile, the jump was 0.6 percent, three times as much as economists had predicted.
The rosy numbers brought the Dow Jones industrial average up to within a point of its highest level in more than a year, as investors grew more confident that companies would be reaping better-than-expected profits this holiday season. Other stock indexes were mixed, with Standard & Poor's 500 rising about 0.4 percent and the Nasdaq composite closing slightly lower.
Trading remained light, however, and concerns continued that an economic recovery might cause the Federal Reserve to move toward higher interest rates sooner than predicted.
The Commerce Department's report on sales brought relief to business owners, who had feared consumers would rein in spending this year as the unemployment rate crept above 10 percent and the recovery showed signs of weakness. The data reinforced the expectation of modest growth in consumer spending over the next several months, economists said, though retail sales alone would probably not increase fast enough to lift the economy out of its downturn.
A gauge of consumer confidence added to hopes of a revival in spending. The University of Michigan's index registered its first increase in three months and outpaced expectations.
The consumer sentiment index reached 73.4 in early December, an increase of 6 points, as Americans appeared reassured by the slowing pace of job losses and encouraged by deep discounts from retailers.
"The momentum here is positive," said James F. O'Sullivan, chief economist for MF Global. "We're seeing that better spending leads to a better job market which leads to better spending, in stark contrast to the downward spiral we were seeing a year ago."
In 2008, the picture of consumer spending was far dimmer: sales took a steep plunge toward the end of the year, dipping below $340 billion a month, as the financial crisis reached its peak. While sales reached $352.1 billion last month, that remained well below the $380 billion monthly sales figures of 2007.
Spending by consumers makes up more than two-thirds of the economy, and some analysts say a true recovery will not come until Americans start buying in large amounts again. That may be difficult in a country where at least 15.4 million people remain unemployed, many of them for more than six months, and as many families struggle with meager paychecks and reduced hours.
"The difficulties in the labor market, the desire to reduce and the tightening of lending standards of all kinds should serve to cap the pace at which spending will rebound in 2010," Dan Greenhaus, chief economic strategist for Miller Tabak, wrote in a research note Friday.
The retail sales figure reflected a 1.9 percent increase from November 2008, when the chill in consumer spending had begun to take hold -- the first year-over-year increase since August 2008.
Sales of cars and gasoline led the strong gains over all, though sales were up for goods of many types, including food, electronics, garden supplies and sporting goods. Cars and car parts rose 1.6 percent, even in the absence of government-financed incentives like the cash-for-clunkers program, and gasoline sales increased 6 percent, pushed up by rising prices. Mail and Internet orders rose 1.2 percent, while clothing sales fell 0.7 percent.
Holiday sales are still expected to come in well below the highs of two and three years ago, and some major chains actually reported sales were weaker than expected in November. Economists explained the discrepancy by noting the government's report measures a wider slice of the economy, including grocery stores and discounters like Wal-Mart.
The Commerce Department also revised downward its October results, saying sales increased by 1.1 percent rather than the 1.4 percent originally reported. The government adjusts its sales numbers to discount the boom from holiday shopping.
There were also indications of economic renewal on the business side. A government report showed that businesses increased their inventories in October, after more than a year of cutting back. The gain was a modest 0.2 percent, but analysts had said they believed inventories would decline by that much. Any increase means businesses are restocking their shelves, which stimulates factory production and creates jobs.
"If firms decide to stop cutting inventories altogether, that's going to be a huge boost to growth," said Haseeb Ahmed, senior economist at JPMorgan Chase. "If that happens, you don't really need anything beyond modest growth in consumer spending for a sustainable recovery."
A report on United States imports and exports released Friday showed signs that vast stimulus efforts worldwide are causing increases in prices. The Labor Department said the price of imports rose 1.7 percent in November, the fourth consecutive month of gains, largely because of increasing fuel prices.
Still, the Federal Reserve has said that inflationary pressures remain in check and that it does not expect inflation to emerge as a threat to economic stability, even as interest rates remain close to zero.

Full text: The stock market turned higher as gains in shares of materials and technology companies offset concerns about mounting debt around the world.
The advance ended a day of back-and-forth trading Wednesday as investors grew cautious about rising government debt levels in Spain, Greece and other countries.
Investors have been looking for safety after the credit rating agency Standard & Poor's reduced the outlook on Spain's debt rating Wednesday.
S.& P.'s move came a day after another agency lowered its credit rating on Greece's government. Investors have been watchful for other signs of problems with global debt ever since a state-run company in Dubai shocked investors two weeks ago by asking its creditors for a debt reprieve.
Meanwhile, stocks again followed moves in the dollar, as they have for months. When it falls, the dollar makes commodities cheaper for foreign buyers and increase profits for American companies that do business outside the United States.
The dollar has steadied this week against other major currencies, interrupting a steady drop since March. The dollar has fallen as investors take advantage of cheap financing to invest in riskier, higher-yielding assets like stocks and commodities. Signs that the economy is improving have cut into demand for safe-haven investments.
In recent weeks, however, investors have been shuttling between buying stocks and hoarding cash as they try to lock in some of the big gains they have amassed since a rally started in March.
As the end of the year approaches, many investors have been building up defensive investments like Treasury bonds. The uncertain tone in the market, combined with light trading volume, has made for choppy trading, which analysts expect to continue through the rest of the year.
Tom Phillips, president of TS Phillips Investments in Oklahoma City, said he expected that the dollar would lose its pull over the stock market because so many traders have placed bets that the currency will fall and lift stocks.
"When everybody understands the game the game doesn't work as well," he said. "I think it will just fray and start to erode."
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 51.08 points, or 0.5 percent, to 10,337.05. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 4.01 points, or 0.37 percent, to 1,095.95, while the Nasdaq composite index rose 10.74, or 0.49 percent, to 2,183.73.
Investors grew concerned that growing debt loads in countries like Greece and Spain as well as the United States and Britain could signal that the threat of defaults and higher borrowing costs could upend a nascent global economic rebound.
While investors want to see the economy grow, they also know that the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates and remove other stimulus measures once the economy appears to be on solid footing. Higher rates could make stocks look less appealing as returns for other investments improve, potentially upsetting a nine-month advance in stocks that has lifted the S.& P. 500 index by 61.4 percent.
Not all the day's news was downbeat. The Commerce Department reported that businesses added to inventories at the wholesale level in October after a record 13 straight months of reductions. Investors hope it is a sign that businesses will soon start restocking store shelves. Wholesale inventories rose 0.3 percent in October; economists had expected a 0.5 percent drop.
Hugh Johnson, chairman and chief investment officer of Johnson Illington Advisors in Albany said signs of improvement in the economy are disrupting advances in the markets because traders predict the Fed will be forced to raise interest rates sooner than expected to keep inflation in check.
The government reported Friday that employers cut the fewest jobs in November since the recession began two years ago. The figures were far better than expected and prompted a re-evaluation of where the Fed stands, despite comments from Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke that interest rates would remain low.
In other trading, Treasuries fell, sending yields higher. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 11/32, to 99 19/32 and the yield rose to 3.43 percent from 3.38 percent late Tuesday.
Gold rose slightly, while oil fell $1.95 to settle at $70.67 a barrel.
Britain's FTSE 100 fell 0.4 percent, Germany's DAX index and France's CAC-40 each lost 0.7 percent.
Following are the results of Wednesday's Treasury auction of 10-year notes and 19-day cash management bills:

Full text: President Felipe Calderon nominated the finance minister Agustin Carstens to be governor of the central bank Wednesday, a choice intended to ensure stability as the country begins to see signs of an economic recovery.
Mr. Carstens, 51, spent 20 years in various positions at the Bank of Mexico until the beginning of the decade. The finance minister since December 2006, Mr. Carstens was able to persuade the congress this fall to raise some taxes to offset increased anti-poverty spending.
The Senate must approve his appointment, which would take effect Jan. 1 after the term of the current governor, Guillermo Ortiz, expires.
"We believe that there will not be major modifications in the way monetary and fiscal policy has been conducted," wrote Gabriel Casillas, chief Mexico economist for JPMorgan Chase, on the nomination.
In his 12 years at the central bank, Mr. Ortiz has reduced inflation from double digits to an expected 4 percent this year. He has also become increasingly outspoken about the conditions that he believes hold back economic growth, particularly the control that a few companies have over the communications and energy sector.
Mexico's economy is expected to shrink 7 percent this year, making it one of the countries hit hardest by the financial crisis.
Mr. Carstens was criticized in Mexico for being slow to recognize the severity of the contraction, given Mexico's close relationship with the United States. Mexico's exports, remittances and tourism revenues were all sharply affected by the recession in the United States.
Mr. Calderon also named Ernesto Cordero, the secretary of social development, to succeed Mr. Carstens at the finance ministry. Mr. Cordero is considered to be a close ally of Mr. Calderon. He spent two years as an under secretary at the finance ministry before taking over the social development post last year.

Abstract: China's trade surpluses and extensive intervention in currency markets have led it to amass $2.27 trillion in reserves, mainly in United States Treasuries, mortgage-backed securities and other dollar-denominated investments, helping to keep interest rates low and finance Americans' borrowing. Appliance manufacturers expect to sell 185 million refrigerators, washing machines and other pieces of kitchen and laundry equipment in China this year, compared with 137 million in the American market.

Full text: For the first time, Chinese will buy more cars this year than Americans. Demand is so high that drivers put their names on long waiting lists for the most popular models.
"I'm disappointed, but what can I do?" asked Zhang Ge Lu, a 28-year-old interior designer. He came recently with two friends to a row of dealerships here in southeastern China to buy a black Toyota RAV4, only to be told that he would have to wait two months for delivery.
And it is not just cars. For more and more consumer goods, China is surpassing the United States as the world's biggest market -- from cars to refrigerators to washing machines, even desktop computers.
The Chinese market is "on full tilt -- booming is an understatement these days," said John Bonnell, the director of Asia vehicle forecasting at J.D. Power & Associates.
China is pulling ahead at this particular moment partly because Americans, debt-laden and worried about their jobs, are pulling back. After decades of gorging on consumption, Americans are saving. And the Chinese, whom economists thought were addicted to saving, are spending more.
Among China's 1.3 billion people, rising incomes are finally making large numbers of Chinese prosperous enough to make big-ticket purchases.
The question is: will they keep spending? The Beijing government is increasing consumption with rebates, subsidies and heavy bank lending. Whether China can turn the spending spree into the seeds of a true consumer society matters not just to China, but to the world.
For years, the West has pushed China to increase domestic consumption and reduce its dependence on exports -- that's because its overdependence on exports has distorted global trade.
To keep its export machine humming, China kept its currency undervalued to make its goods more competitive in foreign markets. The county beggared its own citizens, keeping salaries and bank deposit interest rates artificially low to support exporters.
China's trade surpluses and extensive intervention in currency markets have led it to amass $2.27 trillion in reserves, mainly in United States Treasuries, mortgage-backed securities and other dollar-denominated investments, helping to keep interest rates low and finance Americans' borrowing. Chinese parsimony enabled American profligacy.
If the Chinese buy more and Americans save more, a more stable global economic exchange can take shape. In the meantime, China's rapid consumption growth is good news for the whole world. For the first time, China, not the United States, is a locomotive helping to pull the global economy out of a slump. But China's tiny appetite for American exports means that the main benefit has gone to commodity exporters and to businesses in China.
Automakers are on track to sell 12.8 million cars and light trucks in China this year, virtually all of them made in China (although many are foreign brands), compared with 10.3 million in the United States. Appliance manufacturers expect to sell 185 million refrigerators, washing machines and other pieces of kitchen and laundry equipment in China this year, compared with 137 million in the American market.
In desktop computers, China moved solidly ahead of the United States in the third quarter, buying 7.2 million compared with 6.6 million in the United States.
Retail sales are growing 17 percent a year in China after adjusting for inflation, almost twice as fast as the overall economy.
Americans have been cutting back on purchases of everything from shoes to furniture to jewelry. But Chinese households are crossing a series of income thresholds at which cars and other big-ticket purchases become affordable.
At the same time, Chinese banks are stepping up consumer lending. The proportion of car sales financed with loans has doubled this year, to nearly 25 percent, although most Chinese still head for dealerships with bricks of 100-renminbi notes, each note worth about $14.62. Credit card spending rose 40 percent in the first nine months of the year compared with the same period last year, yet China still has just one credit card for every eight people, compared to two credit cards for each American man, woman and child.
While it is spreading creature comforts, China's lending-based prosperity may also be sowing the seeds of future economic problems. China's Banking Regulatory Commission recently told banks to show restraint in lending for the rest of the year, fearful that some of this year's loans could become bad debts in the next several years, as happened with the mortgage lending spree in the United States.
The regulator threatened to block banks' overseas investments and branch openings unless they can demonstrate adequate capital to cover risks.
The size of China's consumer market, notwithstanding its growth, will make it hard for China to rescue the world economy by itself. Total consumer spending in China is still less than a sixth of American consumer spending at current prices and exchange rates. That is mainly because China has relatively few restaurants, hotels and other service businesses, even as sales of manufactured goods have risen.
The average price tags on most Chinese products are much lower than in Western markets. For many products, including some in which China leads in the sheer number of goods, the total dollar value of sales in China is still smaller than in the United States.
The average new car sells for $17,000 in China compared with almost $30,000 in the United States, according to J.D. Power. This is because Chinese consumers buy more subcompacts and fewer sport utility vehicles. While the Chinese market is one-quarter larger in the number of cars sold, the American market is still about two-thirds larger in dollar terms.
Similarly, the United States market for household appliances is a third larger in dollars, even though the Chinese market is a third larger in the number of appliances. Cooking ranges in China are sold for countertop installation without a lot of other equipment, for example.
"You don't have the cook-a-turkey-in-the-oven type of product in China, because we don't have that kind of cooking," said Philip S. Carmichael, the president of Asian operations at Haier, China's biggest appliance manufacturer.
But in some sectors, Chinese buyers are already proving more lavish than Americans. The average flat-panel television sold in China is bigger than in the United States, according to AU Optronics of Taiwan, the world's third-largest manufacturer of flat-panel televisions.
When car sales began surging early this year, many auto executives attributed the boom to government incentives. To stimulate the economy, the government has offered rebates for rural families to buy cars and household appliances, and has cut sales taxes on cars with small engines.
But the boom has broadened to categories that barely qualify for incentives.
S.U.V. sales rose 72 percent in October from a year earlier. At Nissan, sales of cars with larger engines that do not qualify for the sales tax reduction are growing even faster than sales of small-engine cars.
Auto sales jumped 42 percent in the first 11 months of this year compared with sales in the same period last year. And sales are still accelerating, soaring 96 percent in November compared with the same month a year ago. Auto sales in the United States plunged 37 percent last month on the same basis.
China's consumers have the potential to buy even more in the years ahead. The savings rate is close to 40 percent -- and will remain high unless and until Beijing creates a social safety net for things like health care or retirement, which would encourage Chinese to spend more today.
And though annual incomes still average just $2,775 a person in cities and $840 in rural areas, Western economists predict the economy will grow almost 12 percent in each of the next two years and the renminbi is widely expected to appreciate someday, further increasing consumers' buying power.

China's Growing Economic Power Is Unsettling the Neighbors

Abstract: [...] it has so far done little to address regional and global unease over the value of its currency, the renminbi. Because the currency is lashed by effective government fiat to the sinking American dollar, China's exports have become significantly cheaper in countries whose own currencies have not compensated for the dollar's recent fall.

Full text: CORRECTION: An article on Dec. 10 about disquiet in some developing Asian nations over China's swift economic growth misstated the trade balance between China and the 10 Southeast Asian countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or Asean, from January through September 2009. The most widely cited figures show the Asean countries together ran either a trade surplus of several hundred million dollars with China or a deficit of up to $2.33 billion; the Asean countries over all did not have a deficit of $74 billion with China. (Different factors can be used in calculating the amount of trade, leading to the wide range.) A reader pointed out the error in an e-mail message shortly after the article was published; this correction was delayed for research.
In the Dickensian depths of the Dunia Metal Works here, all is cacophony: the bam bam bam of grease-drenched punches; the rhythmic clank of unspooling steel wire; the storm and stress of glinting, freshly minted nails cascading onto a broad metal table for boxing.
But for all the industrial din, Dunia is undergoing a painful slump. Today it runs at 40 percent of its capacity, its domestic nail business imperiled -- and its exports wiped out -- by cheaper Chinese alternatives.
"We have been competing with the Japanese and the Koreans," said Juniarto Suhandinata, the factory's director. "But the Chinese -- no chance."
The Chinese are tough competitors, and Dunia is hardly the first to find out. But Mr. Suhandinata's lament speaks to something different: a sense of disquiet, even in developing Asian nations in Beijing's orbit, over the implications of China's swift, seemingly boundless economic growth.
China has long claimed to be just another developing nation, even as its economic power far outstripped that of any other emerging country.
Now, it is finding it harder to cast itself as a friendly alternative to an imperious American superpower. For many in Asia, it is the new colossus.
"China 10 years ago is totally different with China now," said Ansari Bukhari, who oversees metals, machinery and other crucial sectors for Indonesia's Ministry of Industry. "They are stronger and bigger than other countries. Why do we have to give them preference?"
To varying degrees, others are voicing the same complaint. Take the 10 Southeast Asian nations in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, known as Asean, a regional economic bloc representing about 600 million people. Through September, they ran up a collective $74 billion trade deficit with China. That is a sharp reversal of the surplus those nations enjoyed in most recent years, and it is prompting some rethinking of the conventional wisdom that China's rise is a windfall for the whole neighborhood.
Vietnam just devalued its currency by 5 percent, to keep it competitive with China. In Thailand, manufacturers are grousing openly about their inability to match Chinese prices. India has filed a sheaf of unfair-trade complaints against China this year covering everything from I-beams to coated paper.
The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, the biggest regional group, last month urged the adoption of "market-oriented exchange rates" for Asian currencies without mentioning -- or needing to mention -- China's currency, which many economists say China keeps artificially undervalued to promote its own exports.
In Southeast Asia, Indonesia is having second thoughts about a free-trade pact China negotiated with the six core Asean nations.
Under strong pressure from industries as varied as steel and motorbike makers, the Trade Ministry said last week that it would seek to renegotiate some of the 350-odd tariff reductions that were envisioned in the first year of the accord, set to take effect in January.
Jong-Wha Lee, the chief economist for the Asian Development Bank, noted that Japan and South Korea were also seen as juggernauts -- and were criticized -- when their state-backed industries rapidly increased exports. But the challenge from China seems different.
"Not just the size, but the speed of China's emerging power is really unprecedented in the region," Mr. Lee said. "So it creates a lot of issues -- not just trade and exchange-rate policies. But in the future, what will be the role of China?"
China has taken some steps to mollify complainers. In April, it proposed a $10 billion investment fund to help build badly needed roads, railways and ports in Southeast Asia, and a $15 billion fund to give Asian nations low-interest development loans.
But it has so far done little to address regional and global unease over the value of its currency, the renminbi. Because the currency is lashed by effective government fiat to the sinking American dollar, China's exports have become significantly cheaper in countries whose own currencies have not compensated for the dollar's recent fall.
In Asia, the renminbi is doubly significant. During the 1997 Asian economic crisis, the values of many regional currencies collapsed, making their goods cheap to foreign buyers. The Chinese then won the gratitude of their neighbors -- and cast their country as a responsible power -- by keeping the renminbi's value fixed. That prevented a competitive spiral of devaluations that many economists feared might make the crisis much worse.
The latest financial crisis tells a different story: China's exchange rate controls are cited as a leading cause of huge global imbalances that contributed to the collapse of 2008.
This time, China has resisted pressure to untie the renminbi from the dollar and let it rise. And its neighbors' exports have suffered as a result.
Michael Pettis, an economist and scholar with the China program of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, argues that China can no longer pursue the same export-driven development model at a time when Western consumers no longer are able to gobble up whatever it and other Asian manufacturers produce.
Until 2008, Mr. Pettis said, "most of these countries ran trade surpluses, and the U.S. was the countervailing trade deficit."
"The entire model depended on the ability of an external agent -- the United States -- to absorb trade deficits," he added.
Indonesia is especially vulnerable to the shift. It is the most populous and arguably the least economically advanced nation among the onetime Asian Tigers, and perhaps the least able to accommodate itself to a new regional order dominated by China.
Didik J. Rachbini, a professor and the founder of an economic research institute here, said that in the past four years, Indonesia had swung from more or less parity in bilateral trade to a deficit equal to one-third of its annual exports to China -- and rising.
The lowly nail is one focus of tension. Making nails is not complicated: start with a bale of steel wire, shave it down to the proper diameter, then feed it into a punch that shapes the nail, cuts it and spits it into a bin. Labor and machinery account for 10 or 15 percent of the cost of a nail. The rest is the cost of the wire.
And that is Indonesia's problem.
"Many Chinese steel factories have overcapacity, so they sell their wire very cheap," said Ario N. Setiantoro, who leads the Indonesia Nail and Wire Factory Association. "Chinese nails enter the market here at about the same price as our wire."
He is right. Most analysts say China has too many steel mills. Its excess steelmaking capacity equals the entire annual production of the world's No. 2 steelmaker, Japan. Every Chinese province wants a steel industry, because it conveys prestige, creates jobs and attracts other business.
Beyond supply, Chinese state-run banks support industry with construction loans so cheap that credit can be almost free, holding down operating costs. China's vast purchases of iron ore lock in volume discounts that Indonesia's small steelmakers cannot match.
Export markets have dried up.
Like Dunia Metal, Surabaya Wire, a nail maker in east Java, has given up on exports altogether. "I used to have 450 workers," said, Sindu Prawira, the chief executive of Surabaya. "Now, we have 170. Almost everybody is like that."
Industries everywhere tend to accuse competitors of dirty tricks when they lose market share, of course, and Indonesia's anemic steel industry shoulders its own share of blame for the nation's competitive problems.
But as layoffs mount, the Indonesian government has been forced to try to shore up ailing producers.
In October, Indonesia's Trade Ministry invoked World Trade Organization rules and slapped a 145 percent safeguard tariff on Chinese nail imports, pending negotiations to settle complaints that the Chinese are competing unfairly.
Irvan K. Hakim, a co-chairman of the Indonesian Iron and Steel Industry Association, said he had aired those sorts of complaints to Chinese officials for years. He did not appear optimistic about a meeting of the minds.
"China is China, you know?" he said, shrugging. "Even the U.S. cannot talk to China."

Full text: Worker productivity in the United States was less robust than previously thought in the third quarter as workers earned more money and output rose at a slower pace, the government reported on Thursday.
The Labor Department said that nonfarm productivity rose at an annual rate of 8.1 percent, still the quickest rate since the third quarter of 2003, rather than the 9.5 percent rate reported last month.
Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast that growth in third-quarter productivity would be revised down to 8.5 percent. Productivity, which measures hourly output per worker, grew at a 6.9 percent rate in the second quarter.
The nation's services sector, meanwhile, unexpectedly contracted in November, with an index measuring activity falling to its lowest reading since July, according to an industry report released on Thursday.
The Institute for Supply Management said its services index shrank to 48.7 in November from 50.6 in October. That was slightly below the 51.5 median forecast of 62 economists surveyed by Reuters.
A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector.
In the productivity report, total nonfarm output in the third quarter grew at a 2.9 percent rate, rather than the 4 percent previously estimated, the department said. Output dropped at a 1.1 percent rate in the previous period. Aggressive cost-cutting has pushed productivity sharply higher.
The number of hours worked fell at a 4.8 percent rate in the third quarter, instead of the 5 percent pace estimated last month, the department said.
Unit labor costs, a gauge of inflation and profit pressures closely watched by the Federal Reserve, fell 2.5 percent, less than the 5.2 percent previously estimated. Unit labor costs were flat in the second quarter.
Compensation per hour rose at a rate of 5.4 percent pace, ahead of the previous estimate of 3.8 percent, and, adjusted for inflation, was up 1.8 percent.
In related economic news, the number of workers filing new applications for jobless insurance unexpectedly fell last week to the lowest level in more than 14 months, government data showed on Thursday, pointing to a moderation in the rate of job losses.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits slipped 5,000, to a seasonally adjusted 457,000 in the week ended Nov. 28, from a downwardly revised 462,000 in the previous week, the Labor Department said. Claims have dropped for five consecutive weeks.
The report covers the Thanksgiving holiday, and a Labor Department economist said both actual and seasonally adjusted claims were down.
Applications have dropped significantly from March's high levels, but are still above the 400,000 mark that analysts say would signal payroll growth.
The four-week moving average for new claims fell 14,250, to 481,250, last week, the lowest level since November last year and the 13th consecutive decline. The four-week moving average is considered a better gauge of underlying trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility.

Abstract: Since a famine that killed many North Koreans and shook the rationing system in the mid-1990s, the North's centrally planned economy, with state-run stores that sell goods at government-set prices, has coexisted with an unofficial economy where people sell homegrown food or goods smuggled in from China.

Full text: North Korea has taken confiscatory steps to curb unofficial economic activity and suppress inflation, issuing a revalued currency and sharply limiting the amount of old money people can exchange for new bills, South Korean news reports said Tuesday.
The measures appeared to be a crude form of shock therapy intended to severely punish people involved in black market trading, which had begun to take root in North Korea in recent years as the country's central planning system broke down.
If carried out as described by South Korean and Chinese news agencies, the adjustment would wipe two zeroes off the value of North Korea's currency, the won, and allow people to exchange only about 100,000 to 150,000 old won for the new notes. That would effectively decimate private stores of cash wealth in local currency. At the official exchange rate, 100,000 won is the equivalent of $690, and at the black market rate it is worth only $35.
Unconfirmed reports on South Korean news Web sites said that the revaluation and exchange limits briefly set off street protests in North Korea's capital, Pyongyang, forcing the authorities to revise slightly upward the amount of currency people could exchange.
The value of the dollar and the Chinese currency skyrocketed as people rushed to underground money-exchangers, said the Yonhap news agency of South Korea, citing anonymous North Korean traders in China.
Rail stations were crammed with "uncontrollable crowds" of people rushing home to swap their money, said Daily NK, a Seoul-based Web site that specializes in gathering North Korean news, citing informants in Haesan, a North Korean town near China, and other cities.
"It's all chaos in markets and railway stations," Daily NK quoted a North Korean as saying.
But Good Neighbors, a Seoul-based Buddhist relief agency that collects information on North Korea through people inside the country, said that Pyongyang and other major cities had returned to "utter quietness" by late Tuesday as the North's secret police, the national security agency and the military increased patrols, and most shop owners closed their stores.
North Koreans were shocked by the currency reform, Good Neighbors said. Many had stored cash to help tide them over during the lean winter and spring months, but now they have suddenly seen much of their savings wiped out, the group said.
There was no official announcement of the measure in North Korea's official media, and the accounts of protests in the North, which would be rare in the tightly policed country, could not be independently confirmed.
"As people rushed to swap money, commercial activities have virtually come to a standstill," Good Neighbors said in a statement. "The purpose of the reform is to kill private market activities that stoked anti-socialism."
South Korea has received intelligence about the reported currency move but has been unable to confirm it, said Chun Hae-sung, a government spokesman.
Choi Soo-young, an expert on the North Korean economy at the government-financed Korea Institute for National Unification in Seoul, said: "The primary aim is to control inflation. But the North also wants to stop the market from prospering too fast."
Since a famine that killed many North Koreans and shook the rationing system in the mid-1990s, the North's centrally planned economy, with state-run stores that sell goods at government-set prices, has coexisted with an unofficial economy where people sell homegrown food or goods smuggled in from China.
For a time, those nascent signs of private-sector activity were cited as evidence that the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, might be inclined to follow the example of China, the North's neighbor and most important backer, which began to move away from its dysfunctional central planning system in the late 1970s. At that time, Beijing first allowed entrepreneurs to supplement the country's state-run production and distribution systems.
But after years of tolerating unofficial markets, North Korea declared in 2005 that it was reinforcing the ration system. Since then, it has restricted the kinds of goods that can be sold in the markets, how often they should open and the age of people who can sell there.
Earlier this year, Vitit Muntarbhorn, the United Nations' special representative on the human rights situation in North Korea, said that the government had singled out women in a crackdown on marketing activities.
He said that by suppressing the private markets, the government was demonstrating its intention to keep North Koreans dependent on the state.
Women have been especially active in the private markets, and there have been reports in the South Korean news media about young North Korean women protesting against the government's renewal of antimarket measures while food shortages have persisted.
In June, the authorities shut down the largest unofficial market for food and goods outside Pyongyang, dispersing traders to smaller markets in other districts, according to South Korean news reports at the time.
One reason is that the mix of state and private activity has fueled inflation, partly by drawing goods that would otherwise be sold at low, state-subsidized prices into more lucrative private markets.
"With the government stores unable to provide enough supplies, unofficial markets have fueled inflation," said Dong Yong-sueng, an economist at the private Samsung Economic Research Institute who monitors the North Korean economy.
Food prices have risen so sharply in recent years that workers can buy only two kilograms of rice, about four and a half pounds, with their monthly wages, according to Open Radio for North Korea, a Seoul radio station and Web site that specializes in collecting news from informants in the North.
The North Korean officials also saw the increasingly vibrant markets as a conduit of capitalist ideas and outside influence on the tightly controlled populace.
By wiping out much of the wealth that traders have accumulated, the currency measure could anger many people who lose money. But from the government's perspective it could have the effect of reducing a growing income gap among citizens, Mr. Choi said.
The measure will have an immediate but short-lived impact in fighting inflation, Mr. Choi and Mr. Dong said. But it could also worsen the North's already acute shortages by discouraging the markets, which have emerged as an important source of food for North Koreans.
"As long as the North's official economy cannot generate enough goods, and unless it can invite foreign investors by improving external relations, inflation will recur," Mr. Dong said. "The vicious circle will continue."

No Big Cost Rise In U.S. Premiums Is Seen in Study

Full text: The Congressional Budget Office said Monday that the Senate health bill could significantly reduce costs for many people who buy health insurance on their own, and that it would not substantially change premiums for the vast numbers of Americans who receive coverage from large employers.
The eagerly awaited report, which came as the Senate began debate on the legislation, provided Democrats with ammunition against Republicans who have criticized the bill on the ground that it would raise costs for a majority of Americans.
Centrist Democrats like Senator Evan Bayh of Indiana, whose votes are vital to President Obama's hopes of getting the bill approved, had feared that the measure would drive up costs for people with employer-sponsored coverage. After reading the budget office report, Mr. Bayh said he was reassured on that point.
Before taking account of federal subsidies to help people buy insurance on their own, the budget office said the bill would tend to drive up premiums. But as a result of the subsidies, it said, most people in the individual insurance market would see their costs decline, compared with the costs expected under current law. The subsidies, a main feature of the bill, would cost the government nearly $450 billion in the next 10 years and would cover nearly two-thirds of premiums for people who receive them.
For most people who get health insurance through employers -- five-sixths of the total market -- the budget office concluded that there would be little change in their premiums relative to the amounts projected under current law.
Administration officials said the report provided a lift to the bill, which embodies Mr. Obama's top domestic priority.
"The C.B.O. has rendered a fundamental judgment that this will reduce the deficit and reduce people's premium costs," said Rahm Emanuel, the White House chief of staff, who huddled with Senate Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill on Monday. "All the Republican leadership will guarantee you is the status quo."
But Republican senators like Charles E. Grassley of Iowa and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader, said the report validated their concerns. They focused on the prediction that unsubsidized premiums in the individual insurance market, less than a fifth of those with health insurance, would rise an average of 10 percent to 13 percent.
"The analysis by the Congressional Budget Office confirms our worst fears," Mr. Grassley said. "Millions of people who are expecting lower costs as a result of health reform will end up paying more in the form of higher premiums. For large and small employers that have been struggling for years with skyrocketing health insurance premiums, C.B.O. concludes this bill will do little, if anything, to provide relief."
The Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, said the highly partisan floor debate that opened Monday afternoon was one of the most significant in the history of the Senate. It is expected to continue for much of December, with supporters and opponents alike offering a raft of amendments as the White House and Democratic leaders seek to put together the 60-vote coalition necessary to win passage.
Administration officials continued to reach out to lawmakers in both parties to try to build support. Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, said she met Monday for 45 minutes with Nancy-Ann DeParle, director of the White House Office of Health Reform, to discuss her concerns about the legislation.
In its report, the budget office compared estimates of premiums in 2016 under the new legislation and under current law. In either case, after seven years of inflation, premiums would be substantially higher than they are today.
The budget office said the analysis of premiums was extremely complex, so the experience of individuals and families "could vary significantly from the average."
"In general," it said, "the proposal would tend to increase premiums for people who are young and relatively healthy, and decrease premiums for those who are older and relatively unhealthy."
Under the legislation, it said, the average premium per person in the individual insurance market would be 10 percent to 13 percent higher than under current law. But, it said, most people in this market -- 18 million of the 32 million people buying insurance on their own -- would qualify for federal subsidies, which would reduce their costs well below what they would have to pay under current law.
For people receiving subsidies, the budget office said, premiums would be 56 percent to 59 percent lower than under current law.
Without subsidies, it said, premiums under the bill would average $5,800 a year for individuals and $15,200 a year for families buying coverage on their own. Under current law, the comparable figures would be $5,500 and $13,100.
"This study indicates that, for most Americans, the bill will have a modestly positive impact on their premium costs," Mr. Bayh said. "For the remainder, more will see their costs go down than up."
Under the bill, the budget office said, individual policies would have to provide more benefits and pay a larger share of costs than most existing policies do. In other words, it said, some people would pay more, but would also get more.
Insurers, it said, would have to cover certain services that, in many cases, are not covered by existing policies in the individual insurance market. These include maternity care, prescription drugs, mental health services and substance abuse treatment. Moreover, it said, under the legislation, insurance would cover an average of 72 percent of medical costs for people buying insurance on their own, up from 60 percent under current law.
The budget office said it foresaw "smaller effects on premiums for employment-based coverage."
In groups with 50 or fewer employees, it said, unsubsidized premiums in 2016 would average $7,800 a year for individuals and $19,200 for families -- scarcely any different from the amounts expected under current law. Of the 25 million people receiving coverage from small businesses, it said, 3 million would qualify for subsidies, which would reduce their premiums by an average of 8 percent to 11 percent.
Large employers would generally not be eligible for such assistance. Their premiums in 2016 under the bill would average $7,300 for individual coverage and $20,100 for family coverage, the report said. Under current law, the comparable figures would be $7,400 for individual coverage and $20,300 for family coverage.
The Senate bill would impose an excise tax on high-premium health plans offered by employers. People who remain in such "Cadillac health plans" would pay higher premiums, but most people would avoid the effect of the tax by enrolling in plans with lower premiums, the budget office said.

Abstract: In a column published on The Washington Post's Web site and scheduled to appear on the op-ed page on Sunday, the chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, sharply criticized a Senate provision that he said "would strip the Fed of all its bank regulatory powers" and a House provision to repeal a 30-year-old law "to protect monetary policy from short-term political influence."

Full text: The chairman of the Federal Reserve Board warned bluntly on Saturday that provisions in financial legislation before the House and Senate would "seriously impair" the Fed as it struggled to maintain financial and economic stability.
In a column published on The Washington Post's Web site and scheduled to appear on the op-ed page on Sunday, the chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, sharply criticized a Senate provision that he said "would strip the Fed of all its bank regulatory powers" and a House provision to repeal a 30-year-old law "to protect monetary policy from short-term political influence."
The Federal Reserve's jurisdiction to regulate banks has come under increasing attack in Congress in recent months, reflecting the anger of voters at the huge taxpayer costs of the bailout of Wall Street.
Mr. Bernanke repeated, as he has many times before, that while some of the measures in response to the financial crisis were "distasteful and unfair," they were necessary.
The White House and senior Democratic lawmakers in both the House and the Senate have proposed eliminating the Fed's current role of setting the rules for products like mortgages and credit cards. Instead, officials have proposed a new federal consumer financial protection agency to both set and enforce rules over such products.
The op-ed article was part of Mr. Bernanke's running campaign to preserve the Fed's powers and independence as the system of financial regulation is overhauled. In the past, it would have been unusual for a Fed chairman to make such pointed remarks in a public forum, but Mr. Bernanke has been more outspoken than most.
"Now more than ever, America needs a strong, nonpolitical and independent central bank with the tools to promote financial stability and to help steer our economy to recovery without inflation," he said.
And when it comes to monetary policy, he said, "independent does not mean unaccountable." He said the actions of the Fed were already thoroughly reviewed and needed to be protected from Congressional influence, "which would undermine the confidence the public and the markets have in the Fed."
A House committee has already completed its first draft of the legislation, while a companion measure has been introduced in the Senate but not approved by a committee.

Abstract: The Case-Shiller index, which covers about 45 percent of the United States housing market, is a three-month moving average. Since July and August were relatively strong, the weak September report could indicate a plunge in prices.

Full text: Home prices are enduring an early winter chill, raising the odds that the economy may suffer another jolt while it is still weak.
Two price indexes released Tuesday indicated that the momentum the housing market showed over the late spring and summer is faltering, even as the government said the economy grew at a slower pace in the third quarter than previously reported.
The Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller home price index, a closely watched measure of the housing markets in 20 metropolitan areas, barely rose in September, rising 0.3 percent from August on a seasonally adjusted basis. Prices fell for the month in nine cities in the index, including Boston, New York, Seattle and Charlotte, N.C.
A report from the Federal Housing Financing Agency showed that prices were flat in September from August.
Real estate, which has traditionally brought the economy out of recession, seems increasingly likely this time to hold it back. The housing market's epic boom early this decade has turned into an epic bust whose effects may take years to shake off.
The housing market is confronting an abundance of inventory, high unemployment, fearful consumers and devastated family balance sheets.
"There is no clear, easy way out for housing," said John Silvia, chief economist at Wells Fargo. "Contrary to my hopes, housing prices and the housing market in general will weaken again."
He forecast a new decline in prices of as much as 10 percent, which he expected to shave a half-point off the nation's economic output just as it emerges from the recession.
In its report on Tuesday, the Commerce Department said the economy grew at a 2.8 percent annual rate in the third quarter, down from the 3.5 percent rate reported last month.
The revised number, based on more complete data, was in line with analyst expectations. It was larger than the typical adjustment, underscoring the erratic nature of the recovery. But although growth was slower, the third quarter ended the longest economic contraction since World War II, with the economy expanding for the first time in a year.
Little of this recovery is reflected in housing prices, which are limping despite improved sales volume.
The Case-Shiller index, which covers about 45 percent of the United States housing market, is a three-month moving average. Since July and August were relatively strong, the weak September report could indicate a plunge in prices.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency uses data from the government mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which until recently were limited to loans below $417,000. Its index tends to swing less widely than Case-Shiller.
The two housing price reports lag, by a month, the figures on the volume of home resales, which were issued Monday for October. Home resales jumped 10.1 percent to the highest level in two years, better than analysts had expected.
Much of the increase was attributed to the $8,000 first-time buyer's tax credit, which had been set to expire Nov. 30 but has been renewed through spring. Buyers who have already owned a home are now eligible for a $6,500 credit.
While brisk sales volume should, in theory, push up prices, Maureen Maitland, the vice president for index services at S.& P., said the oversupply of inventory was acting as a brake. "You can look down the street and have 10 houses to choose from," she said.
About 3.57 million used homes are for sale, a number that has been declining but is still higher than the historic average. It represents seven months of inventory at the current sales rate.
Ms. Maitland speculated that the housing market might follow a "W" pattern, as the price lows plumbed last spring are tested again this winter.
"There is going to be more moderation and downturn in the coming months," she said.
While that might be good for prospective buyers, it would put more stress on would-be sellers and everyone who looks to his or her house to measure net worth and ability to spend.
Consumers are much poorer than they were, and are acting accordingly. Consumer spending in the third quarter increased 2.9 percent, less than the 3.4 percent originally reported.
That number worried some economists, who said it was below healthy margins and even lower than growth levels in 1983, when joblessness was as high. Consumer spending makes up about 70 percent of the economy.
Julia Coronado, senior United States economist at BNP Paribas, said the revised figures suggested economic renewal would be mild indeed.
"It's going to be a very gradual pace of recovering instead of a roaring return to business as usual," she said. "The G.D.P. number highlights this recovery is different from prior recoveries."
Also released Tuesday was the S.& P./Case-Shiller National Home Price Index. That index covers a broader segment of the market, about 75 percent, but is released quarterly, rather than monthly.
The national index showed an 8.9 percent decline in the third quarter of 2009 from the third quarter of 2008, a substantial improvement over the 14.7 percent decline in the annual rate of return in the second quarter of 2009.
Despite such improvements, it will be a long time under the most favorable circumstances before housing recovers what it lost. The 20-city composite index is off nearly 10 percent in the last year and 29.1 percent since its 2006 peak.
Prices in Las Vegas have declined for 37 months and are down more than half from their peak. At the other extreme is Dallas, which did not have much of a boom and thus did not have so far to fall. Prices there are only down about 5 percent.
Florida has been ravaged almost as much as Las Vegas. About a quarter of its homeowners with mortgages are late with payments. But even there, some people are still buying.
"They're not buying as investors, they're buying as homeowners," said Grant Stern of Morningside Mortgage Corporation in Bay Harbor Islands, Fla., near Miami Beach. "Nobody expects a 50 percent gain. Flat is the new up."
One of Mr. Stern's clients is Howard Roth, who recently moved to Florida from Oakland, Calif., where he lived in an apartment. He closed on a house in Boca Raton on Monday.
"I wanted a dog, and a yard for a dog," Mr. Roth, a 61-year-old retiree, said. The turmoil in the market did not faze him.
"America always bounces back," he said. "Somebody's got to make a move."

Full text: Policy makers at the Federal Reserve have become slightly more optimistic about the pace of the economic recovery, but they continue to predict that unemployment will remain well above 9 percent through 2010, according to new forecasts released on Tuesday.
The forecasts, along with the minutes of the central bank's policy meeting earlier this month, show that officials remain worried about the fragility of the economic recovery even as they begin a more intensive debate about how and when to remove their emergency supports.
The uncertainty has probably increased since the Fed meeting three weeks ago. On Tuesday, the Commerce Department reduced its estimate of economic growth in the third quarter to 2.8 percent, from 3.5 percent. Last week, the government reported that housing starts plunged 10.6 percent in October, a drop that sent chills through financial markets.
According to the Fed minutes, policy makers were still unconvinced that the recovery was strong enough to be self-sustaining without government stimulus efforts like the cash-for-clunkers program.
"It was not clear how much of the recent firming in final demand reflected the effects of temporary fiscal programs to support the auto and housing sectors," the Fed said in its summary of the discussions. Most policy makers expected the recovery to be "rather slow" and to bring only a "slow improvement" in unemployment next year.
But the minutes also hinted at a debate about when to start raising interest rates.
Fed officials will eventually have to raise the benchmark overnight interest rate, which has been held at virtually zero since last December. In addition, they need to end their program to prop up mortgage lending by purchasing $1.25 trillion in mortgage-related securities.
That program is set to end in March, and the real estate industry is already worried that mortgage rates will jump. But at some point, officials want to shrink their holdings and bring the Fed's balance sheet back to normal.
The minutes describe a spirited debate about the best way to do that, though no hint about when to start. Some members argued that the Fed could sell some of the securities outright. Others warned that such sales could cause a damaging spike in long-term interest rates, and argued that the central bank should manage the "exit strategy" with a combination of more indirect approaches.
Fed officials also hinted at a debate about when to raise the overnight Federal funds rate from its current level of zero.
"Members noted the possibility that some negative side effects might result from the maintenance of very low short-term interest rates," the Fed recounted. Though policy makers decided that the risks were "relatively low," they agreed to "remain alert" to them.
Brian A. Bethune, an economist at IHS Global Insight, said the comments were more like obligatory boilerplate than a signal of future tightening. "It's like the 18-year-old going out with the keys to the car and says, 'of course I'll drive carefully' before he even gets the sermon from his parents."
Most, if not all, of the Fed policy makers appeared to agree that for now unemployment posed a bigger risk than inflation.
The new forecasts, produced by each of the Fed governors in Washington and the presidents of regional Federal Reserve banks around the country, were slightly more optimistic about the pace of growth.
The "central tendency" of the forecasts predicted that the economy would expand 2.5 to 3.5 percent next year. That was slightly faster than the predictions from June, reflecting a pickup in growth this summer that was somewhat faster than Fed officials had expected.
But over all, Fed officials barely budged from their previously somber prognosis of plodding growth, high unemployment and low inflation for the next two years. On average, they predicted that the jobless rate would be 9.3 to 9.7 percent in 2010. They predicted that unemployment would average about 7 percent even in 2012.
"Most members projected that over the next couple of years, the unemployment rate would remain quite elevated, and the level of inflation would remain below rates consistent over the longer run with the Federal Reserve's objectives," the central bank reported.
For practical purposes, Fed officials have generally wanted to keep the core rate of inflation, which excludes volatile prices for food and energy, around 2 percent or slightly below.
But that core rate has drifted below 1.5 percent in the last year, and most Fed policy makers predicted that it would remain below 2 percent through 2012 and for the longer run as well. To many Fed officials, that means there is still ample time to keep interest rates low without stoking inflation pressures.

Markets Edge Down as Consumer Confidence Stays Low

Full text: A disappointing report on consumer confidence and a more sober read on the economy pulled stocks down on Tuesday from 13-month highs.
Major indexes posted modest losses in light trading as drops in financial and industrial stocks were tempered by gains in health care companies. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 17 points the day after it jumped by 133.
Stocks pulled away from their lows of the day after the Federal Reserve released minutes from its latest rate-setting meeting, where it pledged to keep rates low for the foreseeable future and said inflation remained at bay. The Fed raised its expectations for economic growth during the second half of this year, but said unemployment would remain high.
Before the report, shares had been falling after the government revised its calculation of third-quarter economic growth down to 2.8 percent, from its original estimate of 3.5 percent, the latest sign that the recovery is likely to be slow.
Meanwhile, the Conference Board said its Consumer Confidence Index rose to 49.5 in November from a revised reading of 48.7 in October. While better than expected, the report showed that consumers remained gloomy heading into the holiday season. A reading above 90 means the economy is on solid footing.
"It's all about the daily data," said Howard Ward, chief investment officer of the Gamco Growth Fund. "Today's was uninspiring."
Mr. Ward said a warning from China's central bank that commercial banks there should control their lending also weighed on the market, financial stocks in particular. The comments raised concerns about growth in one of the biggest trade partners of the United States.
The market's modest moves came after a big rally on Monday carried the Dow Jones industrials up to their highest level in just over a year. A weakening dollar and an upbeat report on housing lured investors back into stocks after a three-day losing streak.
The Dow fell 17.24 points, or 0.2 percent, to 10,433.71. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 0.59 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,105.65, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 6.83 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,169.18.
The dollar's weakness has been a big driver behind higher stock prices this year. Investors have been taking advantage of interest rates at record lows to invest in assets other than cash that can earn them better returns.
As the end of the year approaches, however, safe haven assets like the dollar and Treasury bonds have become more appealing as investors seek to safeguard some of the big gains in the stock market this year.
A report of the fourth consecutive month of improving house prices in September did little to shore up investor confidence. The Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller home price index rose 0.3 percent in September from the previous month.
A slightly stronger dollar put pressure on the shares of commodities and materials producing companies.
Among health care stocks, Medtronic rose more than 7 percent after it reported a 59 percent increase in its quarterly profit and raised its full-year outlook. Shares gained $2.94 to $43.25.
Bond prices rose after a strong auction of five-year notes. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 12/32, to 100 19/32, and the yield fell to 3.30 percent, from 3.35 percent late Monday.
Following are the results of Tuesday's Treasury auction of four-week bills and five-year notes:

Full text: The United States government is financing its more than trillion-dollar-a-year borrowing with i.o.u.'s on terms that seem too good to be true.
But that happy situation, aided by ultralow interest rates, may not last much longer.
Treasury officials now face a trifecta of headaches: a mountain of new debt, a balloon of short-term borrowings that come due in the months ahead, and interest rates that are sure to climb back to normal as soon as the Federal Reserve decides that the emergency has passed.
Even as Treasury officials are racing to lock in today's low rates by exchanging short-term borrowings for long-term bonds, the government faces a payment shock similar to those that sent legions of overstretched homeowners into default on their mortgages.
With the national debt now topping $12 trillion, the White House estimates that the government's tab for servicing the debt will exceed $700 billion a year in 2019, up from $202 billion this year, even if annual budget deficits shrink drastically. Other forecasters say the figure could be much higher.
In concrete terms, an additional $500 billion a year in interest expense would total more than the combined federal budgets this year for education, energy, homeland security and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
The potential for rapidly escalating interest payouts is just one of the wrenching challenges facing the United States after decades of living beyond its means.
The surge in borrowing over the last year or two is widely judged to have been a necessary response to the financial crisis and the deep recession, and there is still a raging debate over how aggressively to bring down deficits over the next few years. But there is little doubt that the United States' long-term budget crisis is becoming too big to postpone.
Americans now have to climb out of two deep holes: as debt-loaded consumers, whose personal wealth sank along with housing and stock prices; and as taxpayers, whose government debt has almost doubled in the last two years alone, just as costs tied to benefits for retiring baby boomers are set to explode.
The competing demands could deepen political battles over the size and role of the government, the trade-offs between taxes and spending, the choices between helping older generations versus younger ones, and the bottom-line questions about who should ultimately shoulder the burden.
"The government is on teaser rates," said Robert Bixby, executive director of the Concord Coalition, a nonpartisan group that advocates lower deficits. "We're taking out a huge mortgage right now, but we won't feel the pain until later."
So far, the demand for Treasury securities from investors and other governments around the world has remained strong enough to hold down the interest rates that the United States must offer to sell them. Indeed, the government paid less interest on its debt this year than in 2008, even though it added almost $2 trillion in debt.
The government's average interest rate on new borrowing last year fell below 1 percent. For short-term i.o.u.'s like one-month Treasury bills, its average rate was only sixteen-hundredths of a percent.
"All of the auction results have been solid," said Matthew Rutherford, the Treasury's deputy assistant secretary in charge of finance operations. "Investor demand has been very broad, and it's been increasing in the last couple of years."
The problem, many analysts say, is that record government deficits have arrived just as the long-feared explosion begins in spending on benefits under Medicare and Social Security. The nation's oldest baby boomers are approaching 65, setting off what experts have warned for years will be a fiscal nightmare for the government.
"What a good country or a good squirrel should be doing is stashing away nuts for the winter," said William H. Gross, managing director of the Pimco Group, the giant bond-management firm. "The United States is not only not saving nuts, it's eating the ones left over from the last winter."
The current low rates on the country's debt were caused by temporary factors that are already beginning to fade. One factor was the economic crisis itself, which caused panicked investors around the world to plow their money into the comparative safety of Treasury bills and notes. Even though the United States was the epicenter of the global crisis, investors viewed Treasury securities as the least dangerous place to park their money.
On top of that, the Fed used almost every tool in its arsenal to push interest rates down even further. It cut the overnight federal funds rate, the rate at which banks lend reserves to one another, to almost zero. And to reduce longer-term rates, it bought more than $1.5 trillion worth of Treasury bonds and government-guaranteed securities linked to mortgages.
Those conditions are already beginning to change. Global investors are shifting money into riskier investments like stocks and corporate bonds, and they have been pouring money into fast-growing countries like Brazil and China.
The Fed, meanwhile, is already halting its efforts at tamping down long-term interest rates. Fed officials ended their $300 billion program to buy up Treasury bonds last month, and they have announced plans to stop buying mortgage-backed securities by the end of next March.
Eventually, though probably not until at least mid-2010, the Fed will also start raising its benchmark interest rate back to more historically normal levels.
The United States will not be the only government competing to refinance huge debt. Japan, Germany, Britain and other industrialized countries have even higher government debt loads, measured as a share of their gross domestic product, and they too borrowed heavily to combat the financial crisis and economic downturn. As the global economy recovers and businesses raise capital to finance their growth, all that new government debt is likely to put more upward pressure on interest rates.
Even a small increase in interest rates has a big impact. An increase of one percentage point in the Treasury's average cost of borrowing would cost American taxpayers an extra $80 billion this year -- about equal to the combined budgets of the Department of Energy and the Department of Education.
But that could seem like a relatively modest pinch. Alan Levenson, chief economist at T. Rowe Price, estimated that the Treasury's tab for debt service this year would have been $221 billion higher if it had faced the same interest rates as it did last year.
The White House estimates that the government will have to borrow about $3.5 trillion more over the next three years. On top of that, the Treasury has to refinance, or roll over, a huge amount of short-term debt that was issued during the financial crisis. Treasury officials estimate that about 36 percent of the government's marketable debt -- about $1.6 trillion -- is coming due in the months ahead.
To lock in low interest rates in the years ahead, Treasury officials are trying to replace one-month and three-month bills with 10-year and 30-year Treasury securities. That strategy will save taxpayers money in the long run. But it pushes up costs drastically in the short run, because interest rates are higher for long-term debt.
Adding to the pressure, the Fed is set to begin reversing some of the policies it has been using to prop up the economy. Wall Street firms advising the Treasury recently estimated that the Fed's purchases of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities pushed down long-term interest rates by about one-half of a percentage point. Removing that support could in itself add $40 billion to the government's annual tab for debt service.
This month, the Treasury Department's private-sector advisory committee on debt management warned of the risks ahead.
"Inflation, higher interest rate and rollover risk should be the primary concerns," declared the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee, a group of market experts that provide guidance to the government, on Nov. 4.
"Clever debt management strategy," the group said, "can't completely substitute for prudent fiscal policy."

CHARTS: THE DEBT BUILDUP: The federal government's debt, stoked for years by deficit spending, has surged because of the economic crisis. Debt is now approaching World War II levels, and more than $1.6 trillion is due in coming months. Low interest rates have made financing the debt less expensive. But when interest rates begin to rise, the government will face problems similar to those of homebuyers who took out mortgages with teaser rates that jump after one or two years.; RUNNING UP THE TAB: Debt as a percentage of gross domestic product; A BALLOON OF SHORT-TERM I.O.U'S COMING DUE: Historically, the government has tried to limit its short-term debt -- Treasury bills that are due from 30 days to one year -- to less than 25 percent of its overall issuance. But the financial crisis created a sudden large need for cash, and short-term debt soared to 36 percent of the government's much-bigger portfolio. More than $1.6 trillion is due by March 31 alone. Replacing any of that with longer-term bonds will require paying higher interest rates.; SOARING PAYMENTS: Much of the debt is currently financed at low interest rates, so payments are very low compared with historical levels.; THE CREDITORS: The government has used annual Social Security surpluses and the contributions to the pension plans of civil service employees and military personnel to finance the debt. When Social Security begins running deficits, as it is expected to do in a few years, or the pension plans need their money, the government will have to raise taxes to pay the benefits, or cut them. Most of the debt has been financed by issuing securities, which pay interest. Nearly half of these securities have been bought by foreign governments. In fiscal year 2009, foreign governments increased their investments by $700 billion to $3.5 trillion. With the debt piling up, however, they may become reluctant to continue lending.; POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS, ONLY ONE OF THEM PAINLESS (Sources: Treasury Department; Haver Analytics; Office of Management and Budget; Congressional Budget Office) (pg.A4)

Full text: A funny thing happened on the way to a new New Deal. A year ago, the only thing we had to fear was fear itself; today, the reigning doctrine in Washington appears to be "Be afraid. Be very afraid."
What happened? To be sure, "centrists" in the Senate have hobbled efforts to rescue the economy. But the evidence suggests that in addition to facing political opposition, President Obama and his inner circle have been intimidated by scare stories from Wall Street.
Consider the contrast between what Mr. Obama's advisers were saying on the eve of his inauguration, and what he himself is saying now.
In December 2008 Lawrence Summers, soon to become the administration's highest-ranking economist, called for decisive action. "Many experts," he warned, "believe that unemployment could reach 10 percent by the end of next year." In the face of that prospect, he continued, "doing too little poses a greater threat than doing too much."
Ten months later unemployment reached 10.2 percent, suggesting that despite his warning the administration hadn't done enough to create jobs. You might have expected, then, a determination to do more.
But in a recent interview with Fox News, the president sounded diffident and nervous about his economic policy. He spoke vaguely about possible tax incentives for job creation. But "it is important though to recognize," he went on, "that if we keep on adding to the debt, even in the midst of this recovery, that at some point, people could lose confidence in the U.S. economy in a way that could actually lead to a double-dip recession."
What? Huh?
Most economists I talk to believe that the big risk to recovery comes from the inadequacy of government efforts: the stimulus was too small, and it will fade out next year, while high unemployment is undermining both consumer and business confidence.
Now, it's politically difficult for the Obama administration to enact a full-scale second stimulus. Still, he should be trying to push through as much aid to the economy as possible. And remember, Mr. Obama has the bully pulpit; it's his job to persuade America to do what needs to be done.
Instead, however, Mr. Obama is lending his voice to those who say that we can't create more jobs. And a report on Politico.com suggests that deficit reduction, not job creation, will be the centerpiece of his first State of the Union address. What happened?
It took me a while to puzzle this out. But the concerns Mr. Obama expressed become comprehensible if you suppose that he's getting his views, directly or indirectly, from Wall Street.
Ever since the Great Recession began economic analysts at some (not all) major Wall Street firms have warned that efforts to fight the slump will produce even worse economic evils. In particular, they say, never mind the current ability of the U.S. government to borrow long term at remarkably low interest rates -- any day now, budget deficits will lead to a collapse in investor confidence, and rates will soar.
And it's this latter claim that Mr. Obama echoed in that Fox News interview. Is he right to be worried?
Well, spikes in long-term interest rates have happened in the past, most famously in 1994. But in 1994 the U.S. economy was adding 300,000 jobs a month, and the Fed was steadily raising short-term rates. It's hard to see why anything similar should happen now, with the economy still bleeding jobs and the Fed showing no desire to raise rates anytime soon.
A better model, I'd argue, is Japan in the 1990s, which ran persistent large budget deficits, but also had a persistently depressed economy -- and saw long-term interest rates fall almost steadily. There's a good chance that officials are being terrorized by a phantom menace -- a threat that exists only in their minds.
And shouldn't we consider the source? As far as I can tell, the analysts now warning about soaring interest rates tend to be the same people who insisted, months after the Great Recession began, that the biggest threat facing the economy was inflation. And let's not forget that Wall Street -- which somehow failed to recognize the biggest housing bubble in history -- has a less than stellar record at predicting market behavior.
Still, let's grant that there is some risk that doing more about double-digit unemployment would undermine confidence in the bond markets. This risk must be set against the certainty of mass suffering if we don't do more -- and the possibility, as I said, of a collapse of confidence among ordinary workers and businesses.
And Mr. Summers was right the first time: in the face of the greatest economic catastrophe since the Great Depression, it's much riskier to do too little than it is to do too much. It's sad, and unfortunate, that the administration appears to have lost sight of that truth.

Full text: Correction Appended
The United States government is financing its more than trillion-dollar-a-year borrowing with i.o.u.'s on terms that seem too good to be true.
But that happy situation, aided by ultralow interest rates, may not last much longer.
Treasury officials now face a trifecta of headaches: a mountain of new debt, a balloon of short-term borrowings that come due in the months ahead, and interest rates that are sure to climb back to normal as soon as the Federal Reserve decides that the emergency has passed.
Even as Treasury officials are racing to lock in today's low rates by exchanging short-term borrowings for long-term bonds, the government faces a payment shock similar to those that sent legions of overstretched homeowners into default on their mortgages.
With the national debt now topping $12 trillion, the White House estimates that the government's tab for servicing the debt will exceed $700 billion a year in 2019, up from $202 billion this year, even if annual budget deficits shrink drastically. Other forecasters say the figure could be much higher.
In concrete terms, an additional $500 billion a year in interest expense would total more than the combined federal budgets this year for education, energy, homeland security and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
The potential for rapidly escalating interest payouts is just one of the wrenching challenges facing the United States after decades of living beyond its means.
The surge in borrowing over the last year or two is widely judged to have been a necessary response to the financial crisis and the deep recession, and there is still a raging debate over how aggressively to bring down deficits over the next few years. But there is little doubt that the United States' long-term budget crisis is becoming too big to postpone.
Americans now have to climb out of two deep holes: as debt-loaded consumers, whose personal wealth sank along with housing and stock prices; and as taxpayers, whose government debt has almost doubled in the last two years alone, just as costs tied to benefits for retiring baby boomers are set to explode.
The competing demands could deepen political battles over the size and role of the government, the trade-offs between taxes and spending, the choices between helping older generations versus younger ones, and the bottom-line questions about who should ultimately shoulder the burden.
"The government is on teaser rates," said Robert Bixby, executive director of the Concord Coalition, a nonpartisan group that advocates lower deficits. "We're taking out a huge mortgage right now, but we won't feel the pain until later."
So far, the demand for Treasury securities from investors and other governments around the world has remained strong enough to hold down the interest rates that the United States must offer to sell them. Indeed, the government paid less interest on its debt this year than in 2008, even though it added almost $2 trillion in debt.
The government's average interest rate on new borrowing last year fell below 1 percent. For short-term i.o.u.'s like one-month Treasury bills, its average rate was only sixteen-hundredths of a percent.
"All of the auction results have been solid," said Matthew Rutherford, the Treasury's deputy assistant secretary in charge of finance operations. "Investor demand has been very broad, and it's been increasing in the last couple of years."
The problem, many analysts say, is that record government deficits have arrived just as the long-feared explosion begins in spending on benefits under Medicare and Social Security. The nation's oldest baby boomers are approaching 65, setting off what experts have warned for years will be a fiscal nightmare for the government.
"What a good country or a good squirrel should be doing is stashing away nuts for the winter," said William H. Gross, managing director of the Pimco Group, the giant bond-management firm. "The United States is not only not saving nuts, it's eating the ones left over from the last winter."
The current low rates on the country's debt were caused by temporary factors that are already beginning to fade. One factor was the economic crisis itself, which caused panicked investors around the world to plow their money into the comparative safety of Treasury bills and notes. Even though the United States was the epicenter of the global crisis, investors viewed Treasury securities as the least dangerous place to park their money.

It cut the overnight federal funds rate, the rate at which banks lend reserves to one another, to almost zero.

The White House estimates that the government will have to borrow about $3.5 trillion more over the next three years. On top of that, the Treasury has to refinance, or roll over, a huge amount of short-term debt that was issued during the financial crisis. Treasury officials estimate that about 36 percent of the government's marketable debt -- about $1.6 trillion -- is coming due in the months ahead.
To lock in low interest rates in the years ahead, Treasury officials are trying to replace one-month and three-month bills with 10-year and 30-year Treasury securities. That strategy will save taxpayers money in the long run. But it pushes up costs drastically in the short run, because interest rates are higher for long-term debt.

Correction: November 24, 2009
An article on Monday about ballooning debt payments for the federal government misspelled, in some copies, the surname of an economist who noted that the bill for debt service would be even higher were it not for current low interest rates. He is Alan Levenson, not Levinson. And a chart with the continuation of the article misstated, in some editions, the size of debt payments due within a year that are currently paying no more than 1 percent in interest. It is $1.9 trillion, not $2.5 trillion.

Abstract: The report, commissioned by the British Council and conducted by the Nielsen research company, drew a picture of a deeply frustrated young generation that feels abandoned by its government and despondent about its future. The report provides an unsettling portrait of a difficult time for Pakistan, a 62-year-old nuclear-armed country that is fighting an insurgency in its western mountains and struggling to provide for its rapidly expanding population.

Full text: Pakistan will face a "demographic disaster" if it does not address the needs of its young generation, the largest in the country's history, whose views reflect a deep disillusionment with government and democracy, according to a report released here on Saturday.
The report, commissioned by the British Council and conducted by the Nielsen research company, drew a picture of a deeply frustrated young generation that feels abandoned by its government and despondent about its future.
An overwhelming majority of young Pakistanis say their country is headed in the wrong direction, the report said, and only 1 in 10 has confidence in the government. Most see themselves as Muslim first and Pakistani second, and they are now entering a work force in which the lion's share cannot find jobs, a potentially volatile situation if the government cannot address its concerns.
"This is a real wake-up call for the international community," said David Steven, a fellow at the Center for International Cooperation at New York University, who was an adviser on the report. "You could get rapid social and economic change. But the other route will lead to a nightmare that would unfold over 20 to 30 years."
The report provides an unsettling portrait of a difficult time for Pakistan, a 62-year-old nuclear-armed country that is fighting an insurgency in its western mountains and struggling to provide for its rapidly expanding population. The population has risen by almost half in just 20 years, a pace that is double the world average, according to the report.
The despair among the young generation is rooted in the condition of their lives, the report found. Only a fifth of those interviewed had permanent full-time jobs. Half said they did not have sufficient skills to enter the workplace. And one in four could not read or write, a legacy of the country's abysmal public education system, in which less than 40 percent of children are enrolled in school, far below the South Asian average of 58 percent.
While most do not trust their government, they attach their loyalty to religion. Three-quarters identified themselves primarily as Muslim, with just one in seven identifying themselves as Pakistani.
The demographic power of this generation represents a turning point for Pakistan. Its energy, if properly harnessed, could power an economic rise, as was the case in many East Asian countries in the 1990s, Mr. Steven said in a telephone interview.
But if the opportunity is squandered by insufficient investment in areas like education and health care, the country will face a demographic disaster, the report said. To avoid that, the authors of the report calculated that Pakistan's economy would need to grow by 36 million jobs in the next decade -- about a quarter the size of the United States economy -- an enormous challenge in an economy that is growing by about a million jobs a year.
Pakistan has a long way to go. The study interviewed 1,226 Pakistanis ages 18 to 29, from different backgrounds across the country, in March and April. More than 70 percent said they were worse off financially than they were last year. This year's budget earmarks just 2 percent of the economy for education, about half the percentage spent in India and Turkey. Life in rural areas is rudimentary. The report cites data showing that 40 percent of households have no electricity, and that animal dung and leftover waste from crops account for more than 80 percent of the country's energy use.
Young people's biggest concern -- far above terrorism -- was inflation, which rose to 23 percent in 2009, pushing 7 percent of Pakistanis back into poverty, the report said. More than 90 percent agreed better quality education was a priority.
There were bright spots. The young people were civic-minded, with a third saying the purpose of education was to create good citizens. They were also more interested in collective action and volunteer activities than their parents. But they were deeply disillusioned with politics, which they saw as corrupt and based on a system in which personal connections mattered more than merit. That sentiment is borne out by the global competitiveness index of 133 countries produced by the World Economic Forum, which in 2009 put Pakistan in slot 101, two notches below Nigeria.
"Here a student struggles day and night but the son of a rich man by giving money gets higher marks than him," the report quoted a young man in Lahore as saying.
That led to one of the report's most surprising findings: Only a third of those polled thought democracy was the best system for Pakistan, equal to the fraction preferring Islamic law, in what David Martin, director of the British Council in Pakistan, called "an indictment of the failures of democracy over many years."
Only 1 in 10 said they were "very interested" in political events in Pakistan, while more than a third said they were not interested at all. The highest-ranking institution was Pakistan's military. Sixty percent of those interviewed said that they trusted it. Second highest was religious educational institutions, trusted by about 50 percent of respondents. The national government came last at 10 percent.
If the government has failed to channel the energy of Pakistan's youth, militant groups have succeeded, drawing educated and uneducated young people with slogans of jihad and, in some cases, of social justice.
The findings were sobering for Pakistani officials. Faisal Subzwari, minister of youth affairs for Sindh Province, who attended the presentation of the report in Lahore, said: "These are the facts. They might be cruel, but we have to admit them."
But young Pakistanis have demonstrated their appetite for collective action, with thousands of people taking to the streets last spring as part of a movement of lawyers, who were demanding the reinstatement of the chief justice, and Mr. Steven argued that the country's future would depend on how that energy was channeled. "Can Pakistan harness this energy, or will it continue to fight against it?" he said.

Full text: THIS is college application season for a lot of teenagers, an apt time to pose questions to Sandy Baum, a former professor at Skidmore College and an economist at the College Board. She is the lead author of the College Board's closely followed annual report on college tuition.
Ms. Baum answered questions by e-mail. Following are excerpts:
Q. What's the most common misperception about college costs?
A. Families and students consistently overestimate the price of college. Headlines frequently focus on the most expensive colleges, but the United States' system of higher education includes a wide variety of institutions offering diverse educational experiences and a wide array of prices. Public two-year colleges -- typically known as community colleges -- generally have much lower tuition than public four-year colleges. Public four-year colleges cost less than private colleges. However, even among private colleges, prices differ by thousands of dollars.
The other major confusion is between the published price, sometimes called the "sticker price," and the net price that students actually pay after taking grant aid into consideration. Federal and state governments distribute billions of dollars in grants (also known as scholarships), but the largest part comes from colleges and universities themselves. They are essentially discounting their prices. Grant aid covers a large part of tuition for many students, particularly those from low- and moderate-income families.
Q. Can you break down the differences between the average sticker price and average net price in the three big categories -- public two-year colleges, public four-year colleges and private colleges?
A. The average grant aid for full-time students at public two-year colleges is more than enough to pay the $2,544 published tuition price. So the average net tuition price at these schools is actually zero. At public four-year colleges, the average net price is about $1,600, compared with a list price of $7,020. At private four-year colleges, it's about $11,900, compared with a list tuition price of $26,273. Of course, each student's circumstances are different, so most students are paying more or less than these average amounts -- and these prices do not include room and board.
The differences between list tuition and net tuition are so large because about two-thirds of full-time college students receive some grant aid.
Q. What have been the long-term trends in net price? Have they differed much among the categories, or are they broadly similar?
A. The net tuition price paid by students at public two-year colleges has been declining steadily for at least 15 years, after adjusting for inflation. At public and private four-year colleges, the average net price is lower this year than it was five years earlier -- despite significant increases in published prices. The federal government has recently increased Pell Grant financing quite a bit, after a number of years without increases.
We don't have good data yet for state and institutional awards in the current year, but aid from these sources has also been rising in recent years. The average net prices student pay, considering all the grant aid they get, have declined at public colleges and risen very slightly relative to general inflation at private colleges over the past decade. This is a real contrast to the published prices, where the most rapid increases have been about 5 percent a year beyond inflation at public four-year colleges.
Q. So sticker prices have increased a lot more rapidly than net prices?
A. Yes. At public four-year colleges, the sticker price rose by 20 percent over the past five years (these are inflation-adjusted dollars, as are all historical comparisons I'm making), but the average net price fell $400 --to $1,600 from about $2,000. At private four-year colleges, the sticker price rose by 15 percent, but the average net price fell 9 percent, or about $1,100.
It is important to note that these figures are just for tuition and fees. Students also have to live, eat, buy books and cover other expenses while they are in school.
Q. Do you think those other costs have become larger or smaller in recent years? Could that be why people feel college is so much more expensive than it used to be?
A. Despite the declines in actual net tuition prices, college feels more expensive to people for a number of reasons. First, a third of all full-time students pay the full published price, without the benefit of grant aid. College truly has become more expensive for upper-income families.
Second, room and board and other living costs have increased faster than inflation over time.
Another very important reality is that family incomes have been stagnant for the past decade for people at all but the highest income levels. This means that it feels more and more difficult for people to maintain their standards of living and certainly more difficult to finance the major expense of going to college.

Full text: HOW do you tell a wealthy heiress from a family farmer? It sounds like the setup for a joke. But in fact it is the fundamental problem underlying sensible reform of the federal estate tax.
Members of Congress are hoping to revise the current law on the estate tax by the end of this year; if they don't, the estate tax will disappear for a year. Lawmakers should use the opportunity to solve the farmer/heiress riddle once and for all and move our tax system closer to the values on which the country was founded -- that hard work should be rewarded and power should not be conferred by birth.
The last time the estate tax was changed was in 2001. At that time, President George W. Bush and the Republican Congress sought to repeal the estate tax immediately, but settled for establishing gradual changes, which over eight years increased the amount of an inheritance that could pass free of tax to $3.5 million from $1 million, and reduced the maximum estate tax rate to 45 percent from 55 percent. Next year, the law calls for there to be no estate tax at all. Then, in 2011, everything is to abruptly reverse course, returning to pre-2001 tax act levels: a $1 million exemption and a 55 percent tax rate.
Policymakers agree that this here today, gone tomorrow and back again structure should not stand. But what should be done?
Proponents of the estate tax, mainly Democrats, argue that we should return to lower exemptions and higher rates so that the wealthy can contribute much-needed dollars to the nation's recovery.
Opponents, mainly Republicans, argue that there should be no estate tax at all, not just next year but forever, because of the burden on small-business owners.
President Obama has proposed a middle course: blocking the scheduled 2010 repeal but making permanent the $3.5 million exemption and the 45 percent tax rate we have now. That would mean less revenue from estate taxes over the next 10 years than if Congress did nothing to change the 2001 law -- an estimated $233 billion less. Moreover, this approach would leave in place the Achilles' heel of the estate tax -- its potential harm to family farms and small businesses -- while providing an unnecessary giveaway to Americans who least need it.
Instead, Congress and the president should forge a different compromise that would respond to the concern for the family farmer and business owner, but still impose appropriate taxes on the wealthy heiresses -- and heirs -- of America.
What's needed, to begin with, is a special rule to facilitate the transfer of family farms and small businesses from one generation to the next. While experts disagree on whether the estate tax has in fact impeded such transfers, the idea that it could is bothersome to Americans. It is important to us that children be able, if they so desire, to carry on the work of their parents. Thus, it is appropriate for the estate tax to have a large exemption for family businesses -- perhaps as much as $10 million, and indexed to rise with inflation.
In order to ensure that this benefit goes to the right taxpayers, the law should require that both the transferring and receiving generations participate in the business or farm for several years and that the enterprise make up a significant portion of the estate.
Sound complicated? Fortunately, the hard work in drafting this provision has already been done. From 1997 to 2001, the law included a similar rule for family-owned businesses. Its protections were too limited, however, providing a maximum exemption of only $675,000 -- not enough to cover many farms and small businesses. By raising the maximum exemption, President Obama and Congress could resolve the family-farmer and small-business problem for good.
Then, we could have a meaningful debate about the appropriate tax for inherited wealth. There is a big difference between wealth acquired through hard work and creativity and wealth bestowed as an accident of birth, and Congress should not be afraid to make this distinction. Keep in mind that inherited wealth is completely free of income taxes. Thus, while a person who earns $200,000 by working must contribute more than $50,000 in federal taxes, a person who inherits $200,000, or even $200 million, pays no income taxes at all.
The estate tax system provides an essential counterpoint to this giveaway. American estate tax rates have been as high as 77 percent, so 55 percent would be reasonable when coupled with a general exemption of $1 million to $2 million.
For too long, the family farm and business issue has served as a distraction, preventing sensible estate tax reform. Congress should get this issue off the table, so that wealthy heirs can contribute their fair share.

Panel Votes To Broaden Oversight Of the Fed

Abstract: The House Financial Services Committee approved a measure proposed by Representative Ron Paul of Texas that would allow Congress to order audits of all the Fed's lending programs as well as of its basic decisions to set monetary policy by raising or lowering interest rates.

Full text: CORRECTION: An article on Friday about a House committee's approval of a measure that would expand Congressional oversight of the Federal Reserve misidentified the state represented by Paul E. Kanjorski, who offered an amendment that would expand government power over large financial institutions. It is Pennsylvania, not Ohio.
In a display of populist anger toward the Federal Reserve, a House panel voted on Thursday to let Congress carry out sweeping new oversights of the central bank's policy decisions and operations.
The House Financial Services Committee approved a measure proposed by Representative Ron Paul of Texas that would allow Congress to order audits of all the Fed's lending programs as well as of its basic decisions to set monetary policy by raising or lowering interest rates.
If the measure becomes law, it would expose the Federal Reserve to far more political pressure than it has faced for decades. Fed officials have adamantly opposed the measure, saying it would undermine the central bank's political independence and gravely threaten its credibility as a bulwark against inflation.
The vote on Thursday occurred despite the opposition of Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, who had wanted to shield the Fed's decisions on monetary policy from political pressures.
Mr. Paul, a libertarian Republican who has called for abolishing the Fed entirely, has introduced a version of his bill in every session of Congress since the early 1980s and never made any progress. But the Fed's trillion-dollar efforts to bail out major banks and rescue the financial system provoked a popular firestorm that ignited both right-wing Republicans and left-wing Democrats.
Mr. Paul's amendment would instruct the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, to carry out audits of all the Fed's operations. Those include an array of emergency lending programs, bailouts of giant financial institutions, dealings with foreign central banks and the central bank's efforts to drive down interest rates by intervening in bond markets.
Mr. Frank had already agreed that the G.A.O. should be authorized to audit all of the Fed's rescue programs, but he had wanted to wall off the Fed's more basic job of setting interest rates to steer the economy.
Mr. Paul's bill would abolish a longstanding exemption that shielded the Fed from Congressional audits of its monetary policy. Supporters of the Fed's independence have argued the shield provided crucial insulation from political pressure, which would make it much harder for Fed officials to take unpopular action aimed at heading off inflation.
"This is a political warning shot," said Vincent R. Reinhart, a former top Fed official who is now a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. "It says that Congress has a mechanism to opine about monetary policy. The fear is that every time there's a threat of higher interest rates, someone in Congress will ask for a study of the costs of higher interest rates."
The Fed was not the only institution exposed to political wrath on Thursday. Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary, came under fire from both conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats at a hearing of the Joint Economic Committee. Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas, told Mr. Geithner he should resign.
At the House Financial Services Committee, which was working on a sweeping bill to overhaul financial regulation, Mr. Frank had argued that Mr. Paul's amendment went too far and would damage the Fed's credibility.
Fed officials have argued that global investors would immediately become more skeptical about the central bank's willingness to fight inflation by raising interest rates, which in turn would force the Fed to raise interest rates higher to accomplish it owns goals to keep prices stable. The result, they have warned, could be both higher inflation and slower growth.
But Mr. Paul and his supporters argued that the measure would do nothing to undermine the central bank's independence. Its only purpose was to force the Fed to be more transparent and accountable to the public.
In a surprising display of political rebellion, about half the Democrats present and all the Republicans voted for Mr. Paul's bill instead of a compromise measure drafted by Representative Mel Watt, Democrat of North Carolina.
In a related move on Thursday, the House Financial Services Committee also approved an amendment by Representative Paul E. Kanjorski, Democrat of Ohio, that would give the government new power to restrict financial institutions deemed too big to fail.
But Mr. Frank surprised some of his colleagues by postponing a vote on the overall bill until after Thanksgiving. Mr. Frank said he wanted time to address concerns raised by members of the Congressional Black Caucus.

Abstract: The small increase in consumer prices signaled that inflationary pressures, by and large, appear to be in check, restrained by the nation's high unemployment rate and significant unused factory capacity.

Full text: Home construction slowed unexpectedly in October to the lowest level in six months, the Commerce Department said Wednesday, resurrecting fears that the housing market may be slow to recover.
A separate report showed that consumer prices inched upward in October, but not enough to make inflation a concern even with the dollar weakening and interest rates at record lows.
The data on home construction showed a decline in the rate of single- and multiple-family home building, contributing to an overall decrease of 10.6 percent in housing starts from September. In total, construction was at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 529,000 housing units in October, falling short of the 600,000 predicted by analysts. Building permits, an indicator of future construction, declined as well, to an annual rate of 552,000, from 575,000, also falling short of forecasts.
Apartment construction slowed to a record low, dipping to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 53,000 in October. Analysts attributed the decrease to the reluctance of banks to finance large construction projects and lackluster demand for rentals as vacancies remained abundant.
Part of the overall decline in housing construction might be explained by the uncertainty in October over whether Congress would extend a tax credit for first-time home buyers. This month, lawmakers voted to extend the credit through April, but builders might have been reluctant to begin construction in October without assurance that homes would be bought.
The revival of the housing market is considered crucial to reviving the economy. Construction adds jobs to the economy, and once a home is sold, consumers typically go on spending sprees as they fill it with appliances and furniture.
"These figures can be pretty volatile from month to month, so it may just be a blip," Paul Ashworth, senior United States economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a research note on Wednesday. "Nevertheless, taken at face value it suggests home builders are still uncertain about the sustainability of the rebound in home sales."
Celia Chen, senior director at Moody'sEconomy.com, said demand for homes would probably remain weak into 2010.
"The housing market is still very fragile," she said. "It seems that the market has bottomed in terms of sales and starts, but that stability can be easily broken, even if affordability is very high."
The Labor Department's report on consumer prices showed that the Consumer Price Index climbed 0.3 percent, above analysts' estimates of 0.2 percent. The index measures the changes in the cost of a bundle of goods for consumers -- things like cooking oil, airplane tickets and medical care.
The increases came because of rising energy and motor vehicle costs, the report said. When the government excluded the cost of food and energy, which can be volatile, prices rose 0.2 percent.
The prices of cars and trucks showed steep increases. Analysts said that could be a side effect of the government's popular cash-for-clunkers program, which depleted the supply of both cheaper 2009 models and used vehicles, driving up prices.
The small increase in consumer prices signaled that inflationary pressures, by and large, appear to be in check, restrained by the nation's high unemployment rate and significant unused factory capacity. On Tuesday, a report on wholesale prices showed similar results, though there were signs that higher prices might be on the horizon.
"Effectively, this gives the Federal Reserve a checkered flag to keep rates exceptionally low for an extended period of time," said Brian Bethune, chief United States financial economist for IHS Global Insight.

Full text: Wholesale prices in the United States increased only slightly in October, the Labor Department said Tuesday, easing concerns that inflation might soon emerge as a threat to the economic recovery in a period of extraordinarily low interest rates.
A separate report on industrial production showed weaknesses in the manufacturing sector, which is grappling with tepid consumer demand. The stock markets, meanwhile, rose slightly. Higher oil prices lifted energy stocks, and trading volume remained light.
David M. Darst, chief investment strategist for Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, said investors took the mixed signals on the economic data in stride.
"It's a two-steps-forward, one-step-back type of environment," he said. "Many people have worried inflation will snap back with a vengeance, but there still seems to be so much global overcapacity that in the short term we can focus on the play at hand."
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 30.46, or 0.3 percent, to 10,437.42. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 1.02, or 0.1 percent, to 1,110.32, while the Nasdaq rose 5.93, or 0.3 percent, to 2,203.78.
The Labor Department's wholesale prices report said that higher food and energy costs contributed to a seasonally adjusted 0.3 percent rise in the producer price index, which measures the cost of goods to companies. That fell short of the 0.5 percent jump economists had forecast.
The index factors in the cost of items like gasoline, food and construction materials to businesses. It is often considered a leading indicator of consumer inflation because it monitors changes in prices before products reach store shelves.
The data showed a 1.6 percent increase in energy prices in October, driven by higher prices for gasoline and electricity. Food prices, particularly fresh and dried vegetables, also increased 1.6 percent.
Excluding food and energy costs, which tend to be volatile, the price of goods to businesses fell 0.6 percent in October.
Inflation has been a chief concern of policy makers as the government tries to revive the economy by keeping interest rates extremely low and pumping billions of dollars into the economy. At the same time, the dollar has fallen to 15-month lows, stoking fears about inflation arising from higher prices for imports.
Even as the Labor Department's numbers suggested inflation was under control, some economists said that was only because high unemployment and unused factory capacity had kept inflationary pressures in check.
While the price of finished goods remained steady, Dan Greenhaus, chief economic strategist for Miller Tabak, said that the price of crude goods, those in the earliest stages of production, increased in an indication that some inflation might be in the pipeline.
"There is little doubt that over the last few months, inflation has picked up in the economy," Mr. Greenhaus said. "But we're nowhere near concerns about a crazy outbreak."
Many analysts say they expect the Fed to keep interest rates low for much of next year. A report on the state of manufacturing released Tuesday by the Fed said industrial production rose 0.1 percent in October, falling short of the 0.4 increase projected by Wall Street analysts. Manufacturing output fell 0.1 percent, the first decline in four months.
In September, industrial production increased 0.6 percent.
Gold climbed $2.10 to $1,141.30. The Treasury's 10-year note rose 3/32, to 100 14/32. The yield fell to 3.32 percent from 3.33 percent late Monday.
Following are the results of Tuesday's Treasury auction of four-week and 52-week bills:

Abstract: To nurture the slow recovery and bolster employment, the central bank has vowed to keep interest rates low for "an extended period," but to prevent a precipitous drop in the value of the dollar, which could stoke inflation, the Fed would have to raise interest rates.

Full text: The chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben S. Bernanke, warned on Monday that high unemployment and a continued reluctance by banks to make loans were likely to slow the economic recovery for the next year.
And in a departure from the usual practice of Fed chairmen, Mr. Bernanke tried to reassure global investors about the recent fall in the value of the dollar by saying that the central bank was "attentive to the implications of changes" and would "continue to monitor these developments closely."
It is rare for Fed officials to comment on exchange rates, which for decades have been the responsibility of the Treasury Department. Mr. Bernanke's message seemed to be that the Fed saw no cause for alarm in the dollar's weakness and that it would not need to bolster the dollar by raising interest rates sooner than it would otherwise.
Taken together, the Fed chairman's comments highlighted the conflicting goals that Fed officials may have to balance. To nurture the slow recovery and bolster employment, the central bank has vowed to keep interest rates low for "an extended period," but to prevent a precipitous drop in the value of the dollar, which could stoke inflation, the Fed would have to raise interest rates.
In an otherwise gloomy speech to the Economic Club of New York, a group packed with financial executives, Mr. Bernanke played down fears that the recent jump in economic growth -- to 3.5 percent in the third quarter after four quarters of contraction -- would be likely to sputter out as stimulus measures wind down.
"My own view is that the recent pickup reflects more than purely temporary factors and that continued growth is likely," he told the business group.
But he also made it clear that worries about high unemployment still trump concerns about future inflation. Unemployment, now 10.2 percent, is likely to remain "quite high" for the next year and will tamp down both growth and inflation.
Private forecasters have echoed the Fed's somber outlook. Economists responding to the Philadelphia Fed's quarterly survey, released on Monday, predicted that unemployment would average about 10 percent through the end of 2010 -- slightly more pessimistic than their outlook three months ago.
Mr. Bernanke warned that banks are still very reluctant to lend money, especially to small businesses that normally generate most of the nation's new jobs.
"Small businesses have seen their bank credit lines reduced or eliminated, or they have been able to obtain credit only on significantly more restrictive terms," Mr. Bernanke said. "The fraction of small businesses reporting difficulty in obtaining credit is near a record high, and many of these businesses expect credit conditions to tighten further."
"The best thing we can say about the labor market right now is that it may be getting worse more slowly," he said.
One standard indicator of job trends -- new claims for unemployment benefits -- has still not fallen enough to signal a start toward net increases in monthly employment.
Mr. Bernanke said that unemployment has climbed twice as rapidly for men as for women, and that the jobless rates for young workers has soared even higher. For workers ages 16 to 24, unemployment is 19 percent. For young African-Americans, unemployment is 30 percent.
The Fed chairman said this recovery, like the previous two, was likely to seem like a recovery with no new job growth, in part because companies have become more reluctant to rebuild their work forces and have found new ways to increase the productivity of existing workers.
In a clear retort to more hawkish Fed policy makers who have worried that inflationary pressures might be nearer than they seem, Mr. Bernanke declared the high unemployment and unused factory capacity -- economic "slack," in Fed jargon -- was still too high, meaning that the economy does not face inflationary pressures yet.
"Although resource slack cannot be measured precisely," he said, "it certainly is high, and it is showing through to underlying wage and price trends. Inflation expectations, which are measured through surveys and through the premiums that investors pay for inflation-protected Treasury bonds, remain "stable," he added.
Perhaps the biggest surprise of Mr. Bernanke's speech was his comment about exchange rates -- a topic that the Federal Reserve normally avoids, because of an agreement dating back to 1951 that the Treasury had responsibility for managing the value of the dollar.
But amid growing anxiety in many parts of the world about the falling value of the dollar in recent months, Mr. Bernanke not only talked about the exchange rate but added that the Fed would monitor the dollar's value closely.
At first glance, his comments suggested that he might be warning about the need to shore up the dollar by raising interest rates. But Mr. Bernanke described the dollar's recent drop as a natural development that did not necessarily require Fed action.
Mr. Bernanke said the dollar initially climbed sharply when the financial crisis was at its most acute in late 2008 and early 2009, because investors had sought safety in Treasuries. But those "safe haven flows" have since abated, he said, and the dollar had "accordingly retraced its gains."
"We are attentive to the implications of changes in the value of the dollar and will continue to formulate policy to guard against risks to our dual mandate to foster both maximum employment and price stability," Mr. Bernanke said. "The Federal Reserve will continue to monitor these developments closely."

Full text: CORRECTION: Because of an editing error, an article on Tuesday about retail sales in October referred incorrectly to one point of data from the monthly Commerce Department report. Sales -- not prices -- were 1.7 percent below October a year ago.
Retail sales in the United States increased by a higher-than-expected 1.4 percent in October from September, helped by a strong demand for cars, the government said Monday.
Prices, however, were 1.7 percent below October a year ago.
The data gave hope to the idea that consumers might begin spending again even in the absence of government incentives like the cash-for-clunkers program. But the numbers were also high because the Commerce Department substantially revised downward its September data. It said sales were down 2.3 percent in September, not the 1.5 percent it had originally estimated.
The increases came in large part because of automobile sales, which climbed 7.4 percent. In September, after the government ended its clunkers program, auto sales fell 14.3 percent. When auto sales were excluded from the numbers, the overall rise was 0.2 percent, which was lower than expectations.
Auto sales were higher than a year ago.
Consumers spent more in October at restaurants and bars (up 1.2 percent) and on Internet and mail orders (up 1 percent) than in the previous month. But sales of home furnishings fell, with furniture down 0.8 percent and building and garden supplies down 2.4 percent.
In a related report, the Commerce Department said on Monday that businesses continued to reduce inventories in September.
The department said that business inventories declined 0.4 percent in September, slightly less than the 0.7 percent drop that had been forecast. The August decline was 1.6 percent.
Ian Morris, head of United States economics at HSBC, said the numbers suggested that the consumption was on track to grow by 1.5 to 2 percent in the last part of the year.
"We get an overall picture of reasonable growth and little, if any, inflation," he wrote in a research note on Monday.
Retail sales measure the total receipts at stores that sell all types of goods, from butter to television sets. A revival in sales is considered crucial to nursing the economy back to health because consumer spending makes up about 70 percent of the nation's economy.
Economists worry that high unemployment will slow the economic recovery as consumers keep a lid on spending, even as the government continues to inject billions into the economy. The unemployment rate reached 10.2 percent in October, the highest in 26 years.
As the holiday season approaches, analysts are combing retail sales data for signs of how busy stores will be in the coming months. An earlier report on October sales at department stores showed gains at high-end retailers like Nordstrom.
Meanwhile, a report on the state of manufacturing in New York State released Monday showed that factory activity slowed in November.
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York's Empire State index of general business conditions fell to 23.51 in November, after hitting a five-year high of 34.57 in October. Economists had predicted that the index would reach 30 for the month.

Full text: Even as drug makers promise to support Washington's health care overhaul by shaving $8 billion a year off the nation's drug costs after the legislation takes effect, the industry has been raising its prices at the fastest rate in years.
In the last year, the industry has raised the wholesale prices of brand-name prescription drugs by about 9 percent, according to industry analysts. That will add more than $10 billion to the nation's drug bill, which is on track to exceed $300 billion this year. By at least one analysis, it is the highest annual rate of inflation for drug prices since 1992.
The drug trend is distinctly at odds with the direction of the Consumer Price Index, which has fallen by 1.3 percent in the last year.
Drug makers say they have valid business reasons for the price increases. Critics say the industry is trying to establish a higher price base before Congress passes legislation that tries to curb drug spending in coming years.
"When we have major legislation anticipated, we see a run-up in price increases," says Stephen W. Schondelmeyer, a professor of pharmaceutical economics at the University of Minnesota. He has analyzed drug pricing for AARP, the advocacy group for seniors that supports the House health care legislation that the drug industry opposes.
A Harvard health economist, Joseph P. Newhouse, said he found a similar pattern of unusual price increases after Congress added drug benefits to Medicare a few years ago, giving tens of millions of older Americans federally subsidized drug insurance. Just as the program was taking effect in 2006, the drug industry raised prices by the widest margin in a half-dozen years.
"They try to maximize their profits," Mr. Newhouse said.
But drug companies say they are having to raise prices to maintain the profits necessary to invest in research and development of new drugs as the patents on many of their most popular drugs are set to expire over the next few years.
"Price adjustments for our products have no connection to health care reform," said Ron Rogers, a spokesman for Merck, which raised its prices about 8.9 percent in the last year, according to a stock analyst's report.
This year's increases mean the average annual cost for a brand-name prescription drug that is taken daily would be more than $2,000 -- $200 higher than last year, Professor Schondelmeyer said.
And this means that the cost of many popular drugs has risen even faster. Merck, for example, now sells daily 10-milligram pills of Singulair, the blockbuster asthma drug, at a wholesale price of $1,330 a year -- $147 more than last year. Singulair is now selling at retail, on drugstore.com, for nearly $1,478 a year.
The drug companies "can charge what they want -- it's not fair," Eric White, the 42-year-old owner of a small jewelry store in Queens, said as he left a pharmacy recently.
Despite having drug insurance, Mr. White says he now pays $110 a month out of pocket for two brand-name allergy medicines, even as he has cut prices in his jewelry store by at least 40 percent to keep customers coming through the door.
He shook his head. "What can I do?" he said. "I need my medicines."
The drug industry has actively opposed some of the cost-cutting provisions in the House legislation, which passed Nov. 7 and aims to cut drug spending by about $14 billion a year over a decade.
But the drug makers have been proudly citing the agreement they reached with the White House and the Senate Finance Committee chairman to trim $8 billion a year -- $80 billion over 10 years -- from the nation's drug bill by giving rebates to older Americans and the government. That provision is likely to be part of the legislation that will reach the Senate floor in coming weeks.
But this year's price increases would effectively cancel out the savings from at least the first year of the Senate Finance agreement. And some critics say the surge in drug prices could change the dynamics of the entire 10-year deal.
"It makes it much easier for the drug companies to pony up the $80 billion because they'll be making more money," said Steven D. Findlay, senior health care analyst with the advocacy group Consumers Union.
Name-brand prices have risen even as prices of widely used generic drugs have fallen by about 9 percent in the last year, Professor Schondelmeyer said. But name brands account for 78 percent of total prescription drug spending in this country. And as long as a name-brand drug still has patent protection it faces no price competition from generics.
Ken Johnson, senior vice president of the industry association -- the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America -- criticized the analysis Professor Schondelmeyer had conducted for AARP, saying it was politically motivated.
"In AARP's skewed view of the world, medicines are always looked at as a cost and never seen as a savings -- even though medicines often reduce unnecessary hospitalization, help avoid costly medical procedures and increase productivity through better prevention and management of chronic diseases," he said.
But Professor Schondelmeyer's analysis -- which found prices for the name-brand drugs most widely used by the Medicare population rising by 9.3 percent in the last year, the fastest rate since 1992 -- is in line with the findings of a leading Wall Street analyst, too.
Catherine J. Arnold, a drug industry analyst at Credit Suisse, said her latest study of the nation's eight biggest pharmaceutical companies showed markedly similar results: list prices rising an average of 8.7 percent in the 12 months ending Sept. 30 -- the highest rate of growth since at least 2004.
As does Professor Schondelmeyer, Ms. Arnold based her price calculations on reported wholesale prices and a formula that puts more emphasis on each company's best-selling drugs.
Ms. Arnold said the prospect of cost containment under health care reform, as well as the tougher business environment, entered into the decisions of manufacturers to raise prices this year.
The industry stands to gain about 30 million customers with drug insurance from the legislation pending in Congress. But the industry also faces the prospect of tougher negotiations from both public and private buyers as the government tries to squeeze savings out of the health system.
"If you're going to take price increases," Ms. Arnold said, "here and now might be the place to do that, because the next year and the year after that might be tough."
Mr. Johnson did not dispute the Credit Suisse study or deny Ms. Arnold's finding that American drug makers have raised prices at the fastest rate in five years.
He said both studies were incomplete by failing to include rebates that drug makers give distributors. But Ms. Arnold, Professor Schondelmeyer and a 2007 Congressional study of Medicare said the rebates often accrue to the middlemen, not consumers, and higher manufacturer prices lead to higher retail prices.
And the drug industry's own major consulting firm, IMS Health, has also reported a significant run-up in prices. Back in April, IMS predicted that United States drug sales might actually decline this year.
Billy Tauzin, president of the industry's trade association, highlighted the gloomy prediction in a June 1 letter to President Obama shortly before striking the deal to cut drug costs by $80 billion. In negotiating the deal, the drug makers argued that they could not afford to give up more than that.
But in October, IMS made an unusual change in the middle of its forecasting cycle, saying it now believed United States sales would grow at least 4.5 percent in 2009 -- or $21 billion more than expected six months earlier.
A major reason, IMS said, was higher-than-expected price increases for drugs in the United States.

Full text: When Holden Thorp, the chancellor of the University of North Carolina, was looking for ways to cut the university's budget, he did what many executives in private industry do -- hired a management consultant.
The consultant, Bain & Company, came up with recommendations that it said could save the university more than $150 million a year. They included centralizing some of the university's widely dispersed procurement operations (up to $45 million) and information technology functions (up to $19 million) and simplifying its organizational structure (up to $12 million).
And since Mr. Thorp hired Bain, both Cornell University and the University of California, Berkeley, have followed suit. In each case, the management consultants examined business functions but stayed away from academic issues like courseloads and tenure.
"Like any other large organization," Mr. Thorp said, "we hire people, we buy stuff, we connect to the Internet, we build buildings and take care of our property, and we wanted Bain to look at how we could carry out those functions as efficiently as possible."
"I thought someone from outside the university world would provide a new perspective," he added.
Bain did offer a new take on a university known for its teaching and research and its beautiful old campus: the report summed up the university with a 10-color organizational chart with 380 little boxes, each representing a department.
For all its academic prominence, the 107-page report found, the university has plenty of inefficiencies. For example, more than half its managers have three or fewer people reporting directly to them.
In addition to the recommended changes that could save up to $161 million a year, the report suggested reining in the more than 100 centers and institutes that have sprung up around the university, many with their own finance, information technology and human resources departments.
"We've already done some of that," Mr. Thorp said recently. "The Institute for Outdoor Drama isn't getting any more state funding."
While most of Bain's recommendations made intuitive sense, Mr. Thorp said, it would have been far harder without the report to know just how to address the problem areas.
"I felt there were too many layers, but I didn't know exactly what and where," he said. "We're trying to cut out two layers."
At North Carolina, the consulting project was financed by an anonymous donor, who specified that Bain should be the company to do the analysis and that the cost should not be disclosed.
At Berkeley, Robert J. Birgeneau, the chancellor, said the Bain contract would cost $3 million -- and hopefully save far more.
"If we could save $30, $40, $50 million for an investment of $3 million, I'd be ecstatic," said Dr. Birgeneau, whose campus has been hit this year with particularly brutal budget cuts. "I'm a physicist, not an expert on organizational structures. But I believe we can be more efficient."
For example, he said, Berkeley has one human resources person for every 85 employees, when the university norm is one for 130 and the industry norm is one for 200.
"We have already successfully consolidated some research functions," Dr. Birgeneau said, "and we want to get a comprehensive view of procurement and I.T. and H.R. across the university to see if there's consolidation we should be doing there, too."
Shrinking endowments and cuts in state financing have forced many colleges and universities, public and private, to turn to hiring freezes, layoffs and furloughs. But for long-term solvency, many will need to find longer-term ways to trim their budgets without damaging their academic mission.
At the same time, parents and politicians alike have become increasingly angry that tuition has been rising far more quickly than inflation -- and that the growth in support staff in recent years has far outpaced the growth in enrollment.
Still, some university employees criticize the hiring of Bain, or any outside corporate-oriented consulting firm, to advise on university budget cuts.
"I don't see it as being very productive or valid or worthwhile," said Tanya Smith, president of Local 1 of University Professional and Technical Employees, which represents about 900 Berkeley employees. "What we're seeing is centralization and treatment of the university as if it were a corporation. And I'm just not sure education and efficiency are on the same page."
Michael Mankins, a Bain partner, said that while there were many differences between corporations and universities -- chief among them that universities do not exist to maximize profits -- there are also many similarities.
"Most corporations can save 15 to 30 percent by standardizing their approach to procurement, and most universities can as well," Mr. Mankins said. "Information technology tends to be very fragmented at corporations, and the same tends to be true in higher education."
With those guidelines and the publicly available North Carolina report, why should universities hire a consultant and not just start streamlining procurement and information technology?
"Folks who look at the reports will know that procurement is a major area, I.T. is a major area, and reducing the number of organizational layers is a major area, but just because you know procurement's a problem doesn't give you the expertise of having handled 930 procurement problems in the last decade," Mr. Mankins said. "Most doctors don't do self-diagnosis, and the same reasoning applies in higher education."
David J. Skorton, the president of Cornell, said he was using the financial crisis as further motivation to grapple with administrative costs.
"We know we have had too much of a proliferation of assistant deans and assistants to ... " Dr. Skorton said. "And this crisis has stiffened my spine about it. My office has gone down from seven to five, people I'm never going to replace, and that has to trickle down."
Dr. Skorton said he was hopeful that the Bain recommendations would have lasting effects on the university's finances. Because the budget situation is so dire, he said, there is widespread consensus on campus -- even some eagerness -- about making changes.
"We've crossed the line where there's a level of awareness that we're facing the most unsettling financial situation we've ever faced and something has to be done," he said.
"We have dozens and dozens of faculty, right this minute, involved in a couple dozen task forces around the campus looking at our academic operations, the departments and the curricular questions," he continued. "But I think it's demonstrable that we can save more money, faster, on our business functions by bringing in people from outside to help us."

Abstract: In New York over the last decade, the state operating budget has risen an average of 5.8 percent annually, far outpacing the average inflation rate of 2.8 percent. The comptroller's office is projecting that the budget gap next year will be nearly $8 billion, and a failure to take long-term steps would exacerbate deficits in 2011 and 2012, as the federal stimulus expires and a temporary increase of taxes on the wealthy ends.

Full text: Gov. David A. Paterson is imploring the Legislature to finally reckon with the state's ugly financial reality.
But first the governor must reckon with the likes of Senator Carl Kruger.
Mr. Kruger, a Brooklyn Democrat who is the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, has amassed a campaign war chest of $2.1 million, in part because of generous contributions from his labor union allies.
Despite a deficit of more than $3 billion, Mr. Kruger has threatened to block any significant cuts to health care and education, the biggest spending areas in the budget. He has presented his own budget plan, which has startled even Albany veterans for its reliance on one-time maneuvers and financial gimmickry.
The governor and lawmakers have clashed over spending before. But recent events have created a new urgency and, in the view of Mr. Paterson and budget analysts, a desperate situation.
The state has lost 270,000 jobs since the start of the recession. The tax bounty from Wall Street has shrunk.
And spending just keeps soaring. New York now spends more than any other state on Medicaid, twice the national average per capita. It also spends the most on school aid, per student, than any other state.
New York is by no means the only place that is struggling. The 50 states confronted a cumulative $162 billion budget gap this year, according to a report issued this week by the Pew Center on the States, which also found that states' tax collections were down nearly 12 percent in the first quarter compared with the previous year.
California may be in the deepest crisis, but others, like New Jersey, are teetering. States are grappling with the burden of unemployment and soaring pension costs. And many legislatures put off hard decisions about spending cuts, making the current situation worse.
In New York over the last decade, the state operating budget has risen an average of 5.8 percent annually, far outpacing the average inflation rate of 2.8 percent. Budget analysts say lawmakers never prepared for the down times.
"We were getting this boom in taxes, and we didn't save it and we plowed everything that came in, in terms of revenue, into expenditures," said Carol Kellermann, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a nonprofit organization that analyzes government spending. "We have money? Let's increase education spending, let's increase health care spending. Let's not question what happens down the road if this bubble doesn't continue."
In Albany, Mr. Paterson took the unusual step on Monday of speaking to a joint session of the Legislature in its traditional off-season, telling members, "Quite frankly, we are running out of money."
Senators have delayed budget negotiations for weeks as Mr. Kruger accused the governor of creating a "doomsday scenario" and vowed not to "succumb to his hysteria."
The battle over how to close the deficit this year is merely setting the stage for a far more bitter fight likely to erupt next year, pitting the governor against a fractious and rebellious State Senate, where Democrats hold a shaky 32-to-30 majority.
How the budget fight is resolved will have implications for years to come. The comptroller's office is projecting that the budget gap next year will be nearly $8 billion, and a failure to take long-term steps would exacerbate deficits in 2011 and 2012, as the federal stimulus expires and a temporary increase of taxes on the wealthy ends.
The labor unions and special interests that control the capital are mobilizing for a fight. And lawmakers are likely to balk at making painful cuts in a year when elections will be held for all 212 legislative seats.
It is not clear whether Mr. Paterson has the stomach for a protracted battle over spending. With the help of Lt. Gov. Richard Ravitch, he has made progress persuading newspaper editorial boards and Assembly leaders that bold action is needed.
Still, on Thursday, Mr. Paterson seemed to be wavering on his commitment to cuts. That day, one of the state's most powerful unions, 1199 S.E.I.U. United Healthcare Workers East, drew 2,000 people to Albany for a spirited rally, demanding that Mr. Paterson back off any budget cuts.
The S.E.I.U. and its health care industry allies do not shrink from aggressively attacking governors. They unleashed a blistering set of television ads against Mr. Paterson last year, blaming him for hurting the most vulnerable people with his budget reductions.
Labor unions are relying heavily on the Senate, especially Mr. Kruger, a stocky cabdriver's son whose voice still carries the accent of the Brownsville neighborhood where he grew up. He is certainly a canny political survivor. When Republicans controlled the Senate, Mr. Kruger, 59, was their favorite Democrat, and he was even given a committee chairmanship. When Democrats won back control last year, Mr. Kruger took over the Finance Committee after joining three Latino lawmakers in a coalition -- they called themselves "the four amigos" -- that won concessions after threatening to join the Republican caucus.
Summing up his political skill, he said, "I know how to count to 32."
Where the governor would cut spending, Mr. Kruger and the Senate prefer one-time measures like restructuring the state's tobacco bonds, a move that would increase New York's debt burden. Mr. Kruger would also draw from the treasuries of public authorities to a greater degree than the governor and wants to increase gambling hours at gaming facilities.
And Mr. Kruger believes the state should set up a commission to study ways to make government more efficient, a step that could take years to show gains.
"If the editorial boards and naysayers would look at this as an opportunity to reshape government, they'd see that cutting programs and services is not going to get us out of this hole," Mr. Kruger said.
He has always been a prodigious fund-raiser, but his new job has helped him build a $2.1 million campaign fund, the largest among the 62 senators.
"The monies that I've raised in my campaign account predate my chairmanship of the Finance Committee; it's not a derivative of it," Mr. Kruger said. "I'm not saying it's hurt, but it's not the sole way I've raised money."
Lawmakers have agreed to return to the Capitol on Monday to resume their special session. Negotiations between legislative leaders and the Paterson administration were to continue through the weekend.
Some are hoping for an uptick in revenues from the recent awarding of bonuses on Wall Street. But Ms. Kellermann warned that the state had to address its deeper structural spending problems.
"The problem is not going away," she said. "New York is going to lag in recovering from the recession and may never recover to the levels we have become accustomed to because of the financial industry."

Full text: American workers are overpaid, relative to equally productive employees elsewhere doing the same work. If the global economy is to get into balance, that gap must close.
Of course, workers in the United States should earn more than their peers in China, Moldova or Vietnam. Americans take advantage of the higher productivity that makes their country rich: better education and infrastructure, abundant capital and a strong work ethic. But how much higher should American wages be?
The answer depends in large part on two measures: the difference in productivity in making goods that can be traded across borders, and the quantity of such goods. Both measures point to a narrowing wage gap.
Many factors are raising productivity in poor countries. Fast development, cheap capital and more efficient shipping all help. Cheap communication via the Internet reduces costs and makes it easy to trade many more goods and especially services.
The global wage gap has been narrowing, but recent labor market statistics in the United States suggest the adjustment has not gone far enough.
One indicator is unemployment, which has risen unexpectedly rapidly. The 7.3 million jobs lost are more than triple the 2 million during the 1980-82 recession. Some of that huge increase reflects the sharp decline in gross domestic product, but there could be another factor: the recession shows that many workers are paid more than they're worth. Another possible sign is the huge surge in reported productivity, which has begun while output is declining. That suggests that some production is being outsourced, often to lower-paid foreign workers.
The big trade deficit is another sign of excessive pay for Americans. One explanation for the attractive prices of imported goods is that American workers are paid too much relative to their foreign peers.
Global wage convergence is great for the poor but tough on the overpaid. It's possible to run the numbers to show that American manufacturing workers should take average real wage cuts of as much as 20 percent to get into global balance.
The required cut may be smaller. But if American wages get stuck above global market-clearing levels, as in the 1930s, the result could well be something approaching Depression-era levels of unemployment.
Anything would be better than that. Both moderate inflation to cut real wages and a further drop in the dollar's real trade-weighted value might be acceptable.
Incompetence Is Legal
The case against two former Bear Stearns hedge fund managers, Ralph Cioffi and Matthew Tannin, was the closest anything came to a trial over Wall Street's role in the financial crisis. Their acquittal suggests that blame is not easily apportioned -- and that mistakes, not conspiracies, offer the more likely explanation.
The men typified the credit crisis. They ran hedge funds packed with subprime mortgage bonds and collateralized debt obligations, one of which was cranked up on leverage. Their collapse in mid-2007 precipitated a crisis of confidence about how to price these opaque instruments that, combined with deteriorating house prices, rapidly led to multibillion-dollar write-downs at financial institutions worldwide.
Snippets of their e-mail exchanges released last year by the authorities implied that the two knew the market was doomed and purposefully lied to investors about it. The messages also indicate that Mr. Cioffi had even taken his own money out before the crash.
But the jury agreed with the defense that they were in fact just debating the state of the market while trying to save the funds. As for Mr. Cioffi's cash, that went straight into another fund he ran to meet investor demands that he have some skin in the game.
Richard S. Fuld Jr., the former chief executive at Lehman Brokers, also kept his stake in the firm as it hurtled toward bankruptcy. So did the former leaders of Bear Stearns, Alan Schwartz and Jimmy Cayne.
There's little doubt they were guilty of excessive optimism -- even of downright incompetence. But as the exoneration of Mr. Tannin and Mr. Cioffi appears to make clear, neither is yet a crime.

Full text: If the economy is getting stronger, why is the dollar getting weaker?
As the stock market surged anew on Monday and into Tuesday, and the price of gold marched ever higher, the dollar took its biggest tumble since July. The American currency sank roughly 1 percent against other major currencies, to its lowest level since the financial crisis broke out more than a year ago.
But the seeming disconnect between the value of the dollar and the value of stocks is, in fact, not much of a disconnect at all. A growing belief that wealthy nations like the United States will forge ahead with efforts to revive economic growth is luring risk-shy investors back into the world's stock markets. But with interest rates down and government spending up, the dollar is swooning. Many market participants assert that the currency is weakening with tacit approval from Washington policy makers.
While the faltering dollar will make everything from French wine to Korean televisions more expensive for American consumers, it will also make American exports more competitive overseas -- a lift for multinational corporations like Caterpillar, Intel and Pepsi.
Indeed, shares of multinationals paced a stock market rally on Monday that left some analysts wondering if a new bull market was building. The Dow leapt 203.52 points, or 2 percent, to 10,226.94, its highest level since October 2008. The broader Standard and Poor's 500-stock index rose 23.78 points, or 2.2 percent, to 1,093.08. The Nasdaq composite index was up 41.62 points or 1.97 percent, at 2,154.06. And Asian markets opened strong Tuesday, with Japan's Nikkei index rising 1.3 percent.
If the stock market seems volatile lately, that is because it is. Since early September, the Dow has surged or plunged more than 1 percent during 18 separate trading sessions.
But while stocks seem to have regained their footing -- the Dow industrials are now up 16.5 percent for the year -- the dollar, once quite literally the gold standard of world currencies, is in retreat. The dollar has lost 16 percent of its value since March. It was hovering around $1.50 against the euro Monday.
In the "bad news is good news" paradigm of Wall Street, the dollar's fall against nearly all the major currencies reflects the growing belief that major governments will keep interest rates low into 2010 and increase spending to revive growth. A weekend communique from the finance ministers of the Group of 20 wealthiest nations offered little support for the dollar: the G20 affirmed its support for keeping stimulus efforts in place but was silent on the dollar's prospects.
Some investors read the statement as a sign that governments would let the dollar weaken more, without intervening in the currency markets.
"It was a deafening silence, another excuse to investors to keep selling the dollar," said Brian Dolan, chief currency strategist for Forex.com. "A lot of it is sentiment-driven, and there the dollar is getting a vote of no confidence."
A currency is usually regarded as a barometer of a country's economic conditions. The stronger the currency, the thinking goes, the stronger the economy, and vice versa. But while a precipitous decline in the dollar might wreak havoc in the American economy and the markets, a moderate decline does not seem to be a big worry for Washington. Indeed, many economists contend that a devalued dollar helped the United States recover from the Great Depression.
As the dollar has fallen recently, the price of gold, which has been on a tear in recent weeks, surged to yet another record. The metal reached $1,103.65 an ounce in late afternoon trading. Its price has fluttered at record highs lately amid a frenzy for it by hedge funds and wealthy speculators. Other commodities also rose, with the price of oil flirting with $80 a barrel.
Rock-bottom interest rates in the United States have cemented the dollar's reputation as a low-yield investment. Last week, in assessing the overall health of the economy, the Federal Reserve gave no indication that it planned to raise interest rates in the near future, stirring concern over inflation and prompting investors to reroute their funds toward gold, oil and the stocks.
"When you have zero percent inflation, zero percent interest rates, zero percent money markets rates, and when you have metals and gold that have skyrocketed to astronomical levels, stocks look pretty good in comparison," said M. Jake Dollarhide, chief executive of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Okla.
But for some investors, a swelling budget deficit and low interest rates are a recipe for future inflation, which would erode the dollar's value further.
In the midst of the crisis last year, investors the world over flocked to havens like United States Treasury notes. But now, with confidence growing about the global economy, many are shifting funds back into stocks, including many emerging markets. Brazil's stock market, for instance, has jumped more than 11 percent in the last five days.
"If the world continues to heal, and investor confidence continues to rise, you will continue to see money leaving the safe, liquid arms of the U.S. Treasury and going back overseas in search of better returns and higher yields," said Rebecca Patterson, global head of foreign exchange and commodities at JPMorgan's private bank.
Policy makers, meanwhile, may face pressure to intervene if the dollar plunges too rapidly. But in the short term, they may see political and economic benefits in a slow but steady depreciation of the currency: a falling dollar could push up exports and send customers at home flocking to American brands.
The Treasury's 10-year note rose 3/32 to 101 4/32. The yield fell to 3.49 percent, from 3.50 percent late Friday.
Following are the results of Monday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills and three-year notes:

Abstract: Even the most bullish of gold lovers were surprised last week when the Reserve Bank of India stepped in and bought 220 tons of gold from the International Monetary Fund for $6.7 billion, a sign that other central banks might move away from dollar-denominated assets like Treasury bonds in favor of the precious metal. On Thursday, Sri Lanka's central bank disclosed that it, too, was buying gold, in a trend that could hurt the United States over time because it needs foreign bond buyers, especially central banks, to finance its growing debt.

Full text: HERE, in a corner of Switzerland where Italian is spoken and roughly one-third of the world's gold is refined into bars and ingots, business is booming. Every day, bangles, bracelets and necklaces arrive in plastic bags -- from souks in the Middle East, from pawn shops in Asia and from corner jewelers in Europe and North America.
"It could be your grandmother's gold or the gift of an ex-boyfriend," said Erhard Oberli, the chief executive of Argor-Heraeus, a major refiner here that processes roughly 400 tons of gold a year. "Gold doesn't disappear."
Amid a global frenzy fed by multibillion-dollar hedge funds, wealthy speculators and governments all rushing to stock up on the precious yellow metal, the price of gold briefly surpassed $1,100 an ounce on Friday, a record high.
Long considered the ultimate refuge for nervous investors, gold has climbed as the dollar has steadily weakened, budget deficits have expanded in the United States and Europe, and central banks have continued to pump trillions of dollars into weak economies, creating fears of another asset bubble that will ultimately pop.
"It's not that gold has changed, but gold buyers have changed," said Suki Cooper, a precious-metals strategist for Barclays Capital. "It's a structural shift we're seeing on the investing side, from Asian central banks right down to individual investors buying ingots and coins."
"Gold's appeal has broadened," added Ms. Cooper, who predicts that it will hit $1,140 an ounce by the second quarter of next year.
Indeed, last month, Harrods, the 160-year-old London department store, began selling coins as well as gold bullion ranging from tiny 1-gram ingots to the hefty, 12.5-kilogram, 400-Troy-ounce bricks that are so often featured in movies and stocked inside the vaults of Fort Knox. Harrods's lower ground floor, where the gold is peddled, has been packed with interested shoppers.
"The response has been astounding," said Chris Hall, head of Harrods Gold Bullion. "Bars are definitely more popular than coins. The 100-gram is the most popular."
IN the United States, ads promising high prices for gold are regular fodder for late-night television spots, while buyers are setting up tables at shopping malls or hosting gold-buying gatherings at private homes -- like recession-era Tupperware parties.
"Everyone and their grandmother has a sign out saying, 'We buy gold,' " said Ron Lieberman, the owner of Palisade Jewelers in Englewood, N.J. He estimates that 10 times as many people come into his store to sell gold now as when the metal was selling for $300 an ounce at the beginning of the decade. "I hear people come in and say gold is going to $2,000."
Jewelry store shoppers aren't the only ones forecasting lofty prices. Jim Rogers, an investor who has made his name investing overseas and in commodities, predicted to Bloomberg Television last week that gold might reach $2,000 an ounce -- prompting a rebuke from Nouriel Roubini, an economist who gained attention for his early warnings about the global economic crisis. At a conference in New York on Wednesday, Mr. Roubini described Mr. Rogers's forecast as "utter nonsense," saying that there aren't any inflationary or economic pressures that would drive the price of gold to $2,000 an ounce.
Even the most bullish of gold lovers were surprised last week when the Reserve Bank of India stepped in and bought 220 tons of gold from the International Monetary Fund for $6.7 billion, a sign that other central banks might move away from dollar-denominated assets like Treasury bonds in favor of the precious metal. India's huge purchase means that gold will now account for about 6 percent of India's $285.5 billion of foreign exchange reserves -- up from the previous level of about 4 percent.
"We have money to buy gold," said Pranab Mukherjee, India's finance minister. "We have enough foreign exchange reserves."
On Thursday, Sri Lanka's central bank disclosed that it, too, was buying gold, in a trend that could hurt the United States over time because it needs foreign bond buyers, especially central banks, to finance its growing debt. Gold closed at $1,095.10 an ounce on Friday, down from its intraday high but up nearly 5 percent for the week.
Adjusting for inflation, gold would have to top $1,885 to set an all-time record.
China has already doubled its gold reserves over the last six years, but the Indian move underscored how even the most traditional investors are shifting a portion of their assets into bullion.
"I have never been a gold bug," Paul Tudor Jones, the prominent hedge fund manager, told his investors last month. "It is just an asset that, like everything else in life, has its time and place. And now is that time."
Over all, in the second quarter of 2009, consumption of gold for jewelry plunged 20 percent, while investor demand for gold increased 51 percent, according to the World Gold Council.
THE Harrods gold line is made by PAMP, a rival Swiss refiner down the road here from Argor-Heraeus, in the nearby town of Castel San Pietro. And demand for bars weighing 100 ounces or less for individual investors is up 80 percent, said Marwan Shakarchi, the chairman of MKS Finance, a Geneva company that owns PAMP.
Inflows of old gold jewelry and individual investor sales are especially strong in the United States and Western Europe, a new phenomenon for MKS, Mr. Shakarchi said. In the past, hoarding gold as an investment was much more popular in the Middle East and Asia. "Europe and the United States are our emerging markets," Mr. Shakarchi said.
In addition to high anxiety about the future, recent political trends may also be playing a part in the global gold fever. With a crackdown on tax havens worldwide and Swiss bankers handing over the names of wealthy American clients to authorities, some experts say rich people now prefer an investment that can easily be hidden from the prying eyes of tax collectors.
"In Europe, people want physical gold to store themselves, with no documents," said Bernhard Schnellmann, director for precious-metal services at Argor-Heraeus. Often, the company doesn't know the ultimate destination of the bars it makes, only the identity of the bank in Zurich or London that is handling the order.
The region surrounding Mendrisio has dominated gold refining for decades, profiting from its close proximity to northern Italy -- which has a long tradition of jewelry-making and cheap labor -- as well as from Switzerland's own reputation for financial stability and discretion. The Swiss government has also nurtured the business, guaranteeing gold assays for purity and carefully regulating the industry.
One of the 100-gram bars that is produced here just about fits in the palm of your hand, with a satisfying metallic coldness that belies its $3,500 price tag. The standard 12.5-kilo, 400-ounce brick, on the other hand, is a monster, straining the wrist as well as the imagination: just one of these thick bars commands a higher price than a studio apartment in Manhattan.
Although India is now a far bigger consumer than Italy of gold for jewelry, the region around here has retained its distinctive status as the gold workshop of the world, with ore arriving from South Africa along with the old bracelets and necklaces destined for the crucible.
"If you give somebody a ton of gold, you don't have to worry about it in Switzerland," said Mr. Oberli, the Argor-Heraeus chief executive. Efficiency, another Swiss virtue, and speed are of the essence in the gold business, because prices change quickly and buyer and seller want to lock in their order quickly, Mr. Oberli explained.
"Everything that comes in has to go out," he said. "It's not our material."
Perhaps as a result, the gold-refining fraternity is secretive, with verbal discretion as much a part of the culture as the high concrete walls that surround Argor-Heraeus and the metal detectors workers pass through when they go home for the day.
"Everybody is afraid someone else is chasing their customers," said Mr. Oberli. "The banks don't want us to know."
Mr. Oberli is wary of walk-in clients and accepts orders from mines only when he can vouch for the origin of the ore, fearing "conflict gold" from rebel-held areas in Africa and elsewhere.
ARGOR-HERAEUS makes sure that even the tiniest amount of the precious metal doesn't disappear during refining. Gold dust from the soles of workers' and visitors' shoes is scooped up on special mats when they leave. And, annually, the overalls that employees wear during manufacturing are burned to recover the smallest fleck.
At the airport in Zurich, where there are special vaults to hold gold, shipments of jewelry arrive daily on early morning flights before making their way here via a twisty, three-hour journey through the mountains on tightly guarded trucks. After the jewelry is unloaded, gold ingots, bars and other forms of bullion -- already stacked like cordwood along the sooty corridors of Argor-Heraeus -- are sent back to Zurich in the same trucks.
"The truck never drives back empty," said Mr. Oberli. "Time is so important because the value of the material is so high."
Mr. Oberli is also confident that he is running a business that, even in the middle of one of the worst economic downturns of the last century, is relatively recession-proof and always of interest to investors.
"Gold has been around as an investment for 6,000 years," Mr. Oberli said. "When there is no alternative, it's there."

Full text: For all the pain caused by the Great Recession, the job market still was not in as bad shape as it had been during the depths of the early 1980s recession -- until now.
With the release of the jobs report on Friday, the broadest measure of unemployment and underemployment tracked by the Labor Department has reached its highest level in decades. If statistics went back so far, the measure would almost certainly be at its highest level since the Great Depression.
In all, more than one out of every six workers -- 17.5 percent -- were unemployed or underemployed in October. The previous recorded high was 17.1 percent, in December 1982.
This includes the officially unemployed, who have looked for work in the last four weeks. It also includes discouraged workers, who have looked in the past year, as well as millions of part-time workers who want to be working full time.
The official jobless rate -- 10.2 percent in October, up from 9.8 percent in September -- remains lower than the early 1980s peak of 10.8 percent.
The rate is highest today, sometimes 20 percent, in states that had big housing bubbles, like California and Arizona, or that have large manufacturing sectors, like Michigan, Ohio, Oregon, Rhode Island and South Carolina.
The new benchmark is a sign of just how much damage financial crises tend to inflict. A recent book by Carmen M. Reinhart and Kenneth S. Rogoff, two economists, found that over the last century the typical crisis had caused the jobless rate in the country where it occurred to rise for almost five years. By that standard, the jobless rate here would continue rising for two more years, through the end of 2011.
Most economists predict that the rate will in fact begin to fall next year, largely because of the federal government's aggressive response -- fiscal stimulus, interest-rate cuts and a variety of creative steps by the Federal Reserve and Treasury Department. Friday's report showed that monthly job losses continued to slow recently, though the improvement has been gradual.
At the White House Friday, President Obama signed a bill to extend unemployment benefits and a tax credit for home buyers, and said that he was looking at ways to enact more stimulus. On Wednesday, the Fed announced that it expected to leave its benchmark interest at zero for "an extended period."
Nearly 16 million people are now unemployed and more than seven million jobs have been lost since late 2007.
Officially, the Labor Department's broad measure of unemployment goes back only to 1994. But early this year, with the help of economists at the department, The New York Times created a version that estimates it going back to 1970. If such a measure were available for the Depression, it probably would have exceeded 30 percent.
Compared with the early 1980s, a smaller share of workers today are officially unemployed and a smaller share are considered discouraged workers.
But there are many more people who would like to be working full time and have been able to find only part-time work, according to the government's monthly survey of workers. The rapid increase in their ranks and in the officially unemployed has caused the rate to rise much faster in this recession than in the early 1980s. Two years ago, it was only 8.2 percent.
One of the more striking aspects of the Great Recession is that most of its impact has fallen on a relatively narrow group of workers. This is evident primarily in two ways.
First, the number of people who have experienced any unemployment is surprisingly low, given the severity of the recession. The pace of layoffs has increased, but the peak layoff rate this year was the same as it was during the 2001 recession, which was a fairly mild downturn. The main reason that the unemployment rate has soared is the hiring rate has plummeted.
So fewer workers than might be expected have lost their jobs. But those without work are paying a steep price, because finding a new job is extremely difficult.
Second, wages have continued to rise for most people who still have jobs. The average hourly wage for rank-and-file workers, who make up about four-fifths of the work force, actually accelerated in October, according to the new report.
Even though some companies have cut the pay of workers, the average hourly wage has still risen 1.5 to 2.5 percent over the last year, depending on which government survey is examined. Average weekly pay has risen less -- zero to 1 percent -- because hours have been cut. But average prices have fallen. Altogether, the typical worker has received a 1 to 2 percent inflation-adjusted raise over the last year.
In the other two severe recessions in recent decades, workers with jobs fared considerably worse. At the same point in the mid-1970s downturn, real weekly pay had fallen 7 percent; in the early 1980s recession, it had fallen 4 percent.
It is a strange combination: workers who still have a job are doing better than in other deep recessions, but the unemployment and underemployment have risen to their highest level since the Depression.

Abstract: Stephen F. Auth, chief investment officer for Federated Investors, said traders were reacting to signs of hope in the labor report, including increases in the number of temporary workers -- an early indicator that employers are restoring staffing levels.

Full text: In the morning, they were hit with a dreary jobs report. In the afternoon, they learned that consumers had again scaled back on borrowing. But even in the face of grim economic news on Friday, investors seemed content just to shrug it all off.
Stocks traded in a hair-thin range all day, with investors picking up shares of industrial companies and selling off financial stocks. The only real movement was a dip at the market's open as investors tried to draw meaning from a report showing that unemployment in the United States had climbed to a 26-year high.
By the end of the day, the Dow Jones industrial average had risen 17.46 points, or 0.2 percent, to 10,023.42. The Standard and Poor's 500-stock index was up 2.67 points, or 0.3 percent, at 1,069.30, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 7.12 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,112.44.
The Department of Labor's monthly job market barometer showed that the unemployment rate climbed to 10.2 percent in October, the highest level since 1983. The pace of job-cutting slowed to 190,000 in October, down sharply from the peak of the recession last winter, but there were concerns that the revival of hiring could still be far off.
The unemployment numbers were slightly worse than Wall Street analysts had expected. Stephen F. Auth, chief investment officer for Federated Investors, said traders were reacting to signs of hope in the labor report, including increases in the number of temporary workers -- an early indicator that employers are restoring staffing levels.
"I just think people are starting to accept the idea that we're not heading into Armageddon," he said. "It took 14 months to go down, and it's going to take at least 14 months to get back, but it's been steadily moving back up."
As the recovery takes shape, the flow of credit to consumers -- through car loans, student loans and credit cards, for instance -- remains constrained. For an eighth consecutive month, borrowing fell in September, the Federal Reserve said on Friday, declining by $14.8 billion, or a 7.2 percent annual rate, to $2.46 trillion.
The price of gold continued to climb to record highs on Friday; the spot gold price rose to $1,095.10 an ounce as the dollar weakened. The Federal Reserve's desire to keep interest rates at historic lows has pushed the dollar lower and left investors turning toward gold.
"Any potential concerns over inflation are another positive factor for gold," said Bart Melek, global commodities strategist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. "There's certainly a potential for gold to move even higher if we get the economy in the U.S. becoming more positive."
In addition, gold traders were encouraged by news that India had purchased 200 tons of gold from the International Monetary Fund, Mr. Melek said.
The unemployment report seemed to drive up the price of bonds, as investors looked to safe government debt in light of concerns over future economic growth and the profitability of Wall Street companies. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 7/32, to 101 1/32, and the yield fell to 3.50 percent from 3.52 percent late Thursday.
Overseas markets closed mostly higher. The Nikkei average in Japan closed up 0.7 percent and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong climbed 1.6 percent. In Europe, the CAC 40 in France was down fractionally, the FTSE 100 in Britain closed up 0.3 percent and the DAX in Germany climbed 0.1 percent. The price of crude oil decreased to $77.43 a barrel, down $2.19 from Thursday.

Full text: THE American love affair with cars seemed to come to a sudden end this year, when car sales became less important to the economy than at any time since the government began counting more than 40 years ago. So far, there are only limited indications of a renewal of the relationship.
The cash-for-clunkers program, in which the federal government offered cash to people who got rid of old, inefficient cars and bought new ones, helped cause a small increase in purchases by consumers. But as the accompanying charts show, there are only the slightest indications of a gain in purchases by businesses.
The government figures on car purchases relative to gross domestic product go back to 1967. In no quarter from then until 2006 did auto sales account for less than 3 percent of G.D.P. But earlier this year, that proportion fell to less than half that figure.
In the third quarter of this year, helped by the cash-for-clunkers program, that percentage climbed back to almost 2 percent, but it is still well below the historic range.
In one way, that plunge provides hope for rapid growth, someday, as sales rise to levels appropriate for an economy with 300 million people.
Figures released this week indicated that vehicles sold at an annual rate of fewer than 11 million in October. But, as Larry Summers, the director of President Obama's National Economic Council, pointed out in a speech at the Economic Club of New York last week, the country needs more than 14 million new vehicles each year to replace cars that are wearing out and to keep up with population growth.
Therefore, he said, sales would come back. But he offered no forecasts as to timing.
One delaying factor could be that the auto companies in recent years engaged in major discounting, particularly in sales to rental car companies and other corporate fleets, to keep volume up. The extra cars produced then may delay the need for increased production now.
The plunge in auto sales this year was a major factor in the sharp reduction in the American trade deficit. Adjusted for inflation, the deficit in motor vehicle trade fell from an annual rate of more than $110 billion a year in 2006 to an annual rate of just $36 billion in the first three months of 2009, in large part because automobile imports plunged. With imports again rising, the deficit has moved back to $56 billion. The figures are in 2005 dollars.

Abstract: According to the survey, published in Monday's edition, 23 private college presidents made over $1 million in total compensation, and 110 made more than $500,000.

Full text: The presidents of the nation's major private research universities were paid a median compensation of $627,750 in the 2007-8 fiscal year -- a 5.5 percent increase from the previous year -- according to The Chronicle of Higher Education annual executive compensation survey.
The highest paid private university executive was Shirley Ann Jackson, president of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y., with a pay package totaling $1,598,247 in fiscal 2008. Ms. Jackson, a physicist and former chairwoman of the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission, has been at Rensselaer since 1999, and first became the highest-paid university president just two years later.
In this year's survey, she was followed by David J. Sargent of Suffolk University in Boston, the top earner in last year's survey, who took in $1,496,593 in fiscal 2008, and Steadman Upham of the University of Tulsa, whose pay package was $1,485,275.
According to the survey, published in Monday's edition, 23 private college presidents made over $1 million in total compensation, and 110 made more than $500,000. Such large pay packages are still relatively new in higher education: as recently as 2002, there were no million-dollar presidents, only four earning more than $800,000, and 27 earning more than $500,000.
Over all, the Chronicle survey found, the median pay for presidents of the 419 private colleges and universities surveyed was $358,746, a 6.5 percent increase over the previous year. Over the last five years, the median presidential pay, adjusted for inflation, grew by 14 percent.
Why is university presidents' pay going up so much?
"I think the answer you'd get from the governing boards that set these salaries is that it's a market and it's increasingly hard to find these people," said Jeffrey Selingo, editor of The Chronicle of Higher Education, which has published its compensation survey annually since 1993. "That said, almost every year, presidential salaries have gone up faster than inflation, and faster than tuition, which rankles some people on campus."
The Chronicle's information is from federal tax documents for the 2007-8 fiscal year, the most recent data available, but from a period before the current economic downturn. More recently, most colleges have moderated, or frozen, salary increases.
"It's important to remember that these pay packages were set before the economic crisis began last fall," Mr. Selingo said. "Since then, many presidents have taken pay cuts, donated part of their pay in scholarships, or had their pay frozen. Next year, it's likely that we won't see many presidents getting big raises."
Mr. Selingo pointed out, however, that even if presidential pay has stopped growing so quickly, tuition has not, with 58 private colleges charging more than $50,000 for tuition, fees, room and board this year, compared with only five last year.
In its previous presidential pay surveys, The Chronicle reported compensation at both public and private universities, and last year, it was the public university presidents who were getting the larger raises.
In the current survey, covering only private institutions, for the presidents of large, complex research universities the pay increase was 11 percent over the year's inflation rate. Over the last five years, The Chronicle found, their median increase, adjusted for inflation, was 19.6 percent.
Presidents of small liberal arts colleges tend to be paid less, with only John A. Fry, the president of Franklin & Marshall College earning more than a $1 million in 2007-8.
While most of the highest-paying universities on The Chronicle's lists are well-known institutions, there are some surprising names as well.
For example, among the five highest paid presidents at master's level institutions are Guy F. Riekeman, the president of Life University, in Marietta, Ga., which is known for its chiropractic program; Charles H. Polk, the president of Mountain State University in Beckley, W. Va., which offers distance learning and branch campuses in several states; and Jerry C. Lee, the president of National University in San Diego, which has dozens of online degree programs and campuses throughout California.
Many of the pay packages in the survey included deferred compensation.
For the first time this year, The Chronicle survey analyzed the "former officer" pay reported on college's federal tax forms, and found that 85 of the institutions, about one in five, were paying at least one former officer or key employee more than $200,000 in compensation in 2007-8.
Three of them paid a former officer more than $1 million: Stephen J. Trachtenberg, a former president of George Washington University's, received a package totaling $3,664,569; Oberlin College paid Nancy S. Dye, a former president, $1,460,420; and Emory University paid Michael M. E. Johns, a former executive vice president who now serves as chancellor, $1,006,188.

Full text: CORRECTION: An article on Friday about a third-quarter expansion in the nation's gross domestic product defined G.D.P. incorrectly. It is the government's broadest measure of total goods and services produced -- not the broadest measure of the government's goods and services produced.
The United States has emerged from the longest economic contraction since World War II.
The nation's gross domestic product expanded at an annual rate of 3.5 percent in the quarter that ended in September, matching its average growth rate of the last 80 years, according to the Commerce Department. But government programs to encourage consumer spending on things like cars and houses are expiring, and employers remain reluctant to hire more workers, suggesting the recovery may not last, economists say.
"The big-picture perspective is that things have improved," said Jan Hatzius, chief United States economist at Goldman Sachs. "The question is, how sustainable is this growth going forward?"
For most people, the recovery will not feel real until jobs are more plentiful and the housing market improves. Jobs may still be hard to find well into 2010, economists say. A government report to be released next week is expected to show that unemployment rose again this month.
Still, Wall Street welcomed the news of renewed economic growth, with major stock indexes ending the day about 2 percent higher. The Dow Jones industrial average soared 200 points, to close at 9,962.58.
Before the third quarter, the gross domestic product -- the broadest measure of the government's total goods and services produced -- had been shrinking for a year. It bottomed out with a 6.4 percent rate of decline in the first three months of this year, the steepest fall since 1982.
The trend was halted last quarter primarily because of consumers, who drove most of the economic gains.
The government's cash-for-clunkers program spurred consumers to spend more on durable goods, orders of which grew at an annual rate of 22.3 percent in the third quarter after a decline in the previous quarter. Similarly, the $8,000 federal tax credit for first-time home buyers helped revive housing sales, which rose at an annual rate of 23.4 percent in the third quarter. Housing sales had actually fallen by a comparable amount in the previous three months.
The $787 billion stimulus package, which was passed last winter and is still being distributed, is also credited with strengthening economic activity, although the precise contribution is contested.
Many economists worry that the effects of these government initiatives will be short-lived and that the next few quarters may show sluggish growth or even a second dip.
The Obama administration has argued that even temporary government programs may make families feel more comfortable with spending and business more comfortable with making bigger investments for the longer term.
Still, withering consumer confidence and concerns about a weak recovery have left companies wary of hiring more employees. The jobless rate reached 9.8 percent in September, its highest in 26 years.
Initial jobless claims fell by 1,000 in the latest week, to 530,000, according to a Labor Department report also released on Thursday. The number has been heading down but is still well above the levels historically associated with job creation, according to John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics.
Concerns about rising unemployment may pressure the administration to look for additional ways to stimulate the economy. Proposals include another extension in unemployment benefits and various job creation programs.
"It's all in the hopper," said Christina D. Romer, chairwoman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers. "It would be irresponsible if we weren't thinking about these kinds of programs."
Businesses are drawing down their inventories more slowly, possibly because they anticipate more demand in the future, economists said. The businesses have largely sold out their current stock, Thursday's report showed. This means they will increase orders in the coming months to replenish supplies.
"Everybody had been dealing with a just-in-time status quo," said Sandra Westlund-Deenihan, president and design engineer for Quality Float Works, a company in Schaumburg, Ill., that makes valve assemblies. She said companies might be growing tired of building new products as orders rolled in one by one, and are now ready to have stock back on the shelves again.
Like many American manufacturers, Ms. Westlund-Deenihan says that international business has helped keep her company afloat. The country's overall exports grew at an annual rate of 14.7 percent, and imports at 16.4 percent, in the latest quarter.
While these numbers mean the United States' trade gap has widened, they also provide hope that the global economy may finally be recovering from a collapse in activity earlier this year.
"When the economy gets fully back on track in the latter half of next year, the recovery is likely to be stronger than the recovery following the 2001 recession, when exports were anemic due to an overvalued dollar and weak growth abroad," said David Huether, chief economist at the National Association of Manufacturers.
The official end of the recession will be determined by the National Bureau of Economic Research. Its business cycle dating committee looks at output as well as other indicators like employment to make that call. The group spent a year examining data before declaring that the recession had begun in December 2007.
Some economists say they expect the panel will eventually decide that the recovery began sometime this summer.
The third-quarter economic growth came without a major surge in inflation.
The price index for gross domestic purchases, a measure of prices that United States residents pay for goods and services, increased at an annual rate of 1.6 percent in the third quarter, compared with a small increase in the second.
Excluding food and energy prices, the inflation index rose 0.5 percent in the third quarter, compared with an increase of 0.8 percent in the second.

Full text: AMERICAN investors can buy bonds issued by foreign governments that are designed to provide protection against inflation, but strategists say those bonds are really more of a bet against the dollar.
"If you are a U.S. dollar-based investor, the currency fluctuations will overwhelm anything you get from inflation indexing" on the foreign bonds, said Aaron Gurwitz, the head of global investment strategy at Barclays Wealth.
For more than a decade, the United States Treasury has been selling bonds protected from inflation, known as Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, or TIPS, whose coupon payments are based on changes in the Consumer Price Index. Investors primarily concerned about protecting their purchasing power during retirement should own TIPS, Mr. Gurwitz said.
Some strategists say that owning the foreign bonds -- individually in a well-rounded bond portfolio, or through an exchange-traded fund -- can be a good way to diversify and add exposure to other currencies.
Brett Hammond, the chief investment strategist at TIAA-CREF, pointed out that global inflation-protected securities, as these bonds are called, typically perform very differently from other asset classes like stocks and commodities -- and even other types of bonds.
Owning any type of foreign bonds hedges an individual investor's portfolio against a decline in the dollar and is especially useful if the portfolio has little exposure to other currencies through investments like foreign stocks. This is true, he said, for investors of any age.
David Darst, the chief investment strategist for the global wealth management group of Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, recommends global inflation-protected securities precisely because they are both a hedge against a decline in the dollar and protection against global inflation.
"It is more of a currency play than an inflation play," he said. "But to the degree that inflation picks up with a global economic recovery, then you will be getting two hedges." Morgan Stanley projects the dollar will fall to $1.60 against the euro by the end of 2010, down from about $1.50 now.
Mr. Darst recommends that individual investors hold 3 percent to 4 percent of their total portfolio in inflation-protected bonds. This allocation could be entirely in TIPS or in a combination of TIPS and global inflation-protected securities, he said, depending on what the investor thought of the dollar.
American investors can buy bonds from specific foreign countries through a broker, or investors can own a diverse basket of the bonds by purchasing the SPDR Deutsche Bank International Government Inflation-Protected Bond exchange-traded fund. This fund owns inflation-adjusted bonds from 17 countries, including France, Brazil and South Korea, but not the United States. The bonds are denominated in 14 currencies. At the moment, no comparable traditional mutual fund is available, according to Morningstar.
Scott Burns, the director of exchange-traded fund analysis for Morningstar, recommends owning both the Deutsche Bank fund and the iShares Barclays TIPS Bond Fund, which only owns American TIPS.
He pointed out that a decline in the dollar often coincides with rising inflation. "If the dollar goes down, the Consumer Price Index generally goes up," he said, because the cost of imported goods increases for American consumers.
For investors who want exposure to foreign currencies but are not interested in inflation-protected bonds, Mr. Burns recommended two funds that own traditional foreign government bonds: the SPDR Barclays Capital International Treasury Bonds fund, which primarily owns bonds issued by developed countries, and the iShares JPMorgan USD Emerging Markets Bond fund. Because inflation has been very low during the recession, many investors have not been focused on inflation-adjusted bonds, which makes it easy to gauge the broad market consensus for inflation: the difference between the interest rates offered for TIPS and for plain Treasury bonds indicates what investors think future inflation will be. At the moment, TIPS prices suggest an average annual inflation rate of 1.6 percent over the next five years and 2.11 percent over the next 10 years.
If inflation is higher than that over 5 to 10 years, the current TIPS bondholders would get a higher return. If inflation fears return, though, those expectations will probably be priced into the TIPS market.
Some investment strategists say that makes this a good time to buy inflation-protected bonds -- either TIPS or their foreign counterparts -- precisely because the outlook for inflation is relatively benign. "You don't want to buy flood insurance when the river is already in your living room," Mr. Burns said.

Abstract: If you wanted to help the economy and you had $14 billion to bestow on any group of people, which group would you choose: a Teenagers and young adults, who have an 18 percent unemployment rate. b All the middle-age long-term jobless who, for various reasons, are not eligible for unemployment benefits. c The taxpayers of the future (by using the $14 billion to pay down the deficit). d The group that has survived the Great Recession probably better than any other, with stronger income growth, fewer job cuts and little loss of health insurance. In the 1980s, Congress reduced the floor to zero -- meaning that benefits would be held constant if prices fell -- but the principle remained the same: heads, it's a tie; tails, Social Security recipients win.

Full text: CORRECTION: The Economic Scene column on Wednesday, about President Obama's proposal to send $250 checks to all Social Security recipients, misstated provisions in a 1970s law and a 1980s law regarding Social Security benefits. A provision in the 1970s law stipulated that Social Security benefits would not decline even if the Consumer Price Index did; the bill did not fix the minimum increase in benefits at 3 percent each year. The 1980s law left that provision intact; it did not create the provision.
If you wanted to help the economy and you had $14 billion to bestow on any group of people, which group would you choose:
a) Teenagers and young adults, who have an 18 percent unemployment rate.
b) All the middle-age long-term jobless who, for various reasons, are not eligible for unemployment benefits.
c) The taxpayers of the future (by using the $14 billion to pay down the deficit).
d) The group that has survived the Great Recession probably better than any other, with stronger income growth, fewer job cuts and little loss of health insurance.
The Obama administration has chosen option d -- people in their 60s and beyond.
The president has proposed sending a $250 check to every Social Security recipient, which sounds pretty good at first. The checks would be part of his admirable efforts to stimulate the economy, and older Americans are clearly a sympathetic group. Next year, they are scheduled to receive no cost-of-living increase in their Social Security benefits.
Yet that is largely because they received an artificially high 5.8 percent increase this year. For this reason and others, economists are generally recoiling at the proposal.
President Obama's own economic advisers raised objections, as my colleague Jackie Calmeshas reported. Isabel Sawhill of the Brookings Institution told me she thought the idea was crazy -- and then noted she was in her 70s. Rosanne Altshuler, co-director of the Tax Policy Center in Washington, says that the checks "seem to be pure pandering to seniors."
Indeed, the politics are attractive. People over 65 vote in large numbers. Saying no to them is never easy.
And therein lies a problem that's much larger than one misguided $14 billion proposal.
With the economy gradually improving, members of Congress and White House officials are just starting to think more seriously about the budget deficit. Fifty-three senators voted down a narrow health care bill last week, with many citing its potential impact on the budget. On Monday, Christina Romer, the chairwoman of Mr. Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, gave a speech in which she said the deficit was "simply not a problem that can be kicked down the road indefinitely."
Just about everybody agrees that solving the deficit depends on reducing the benefits that current law has promised to retirees, via Medicare and Social Security. That's not how people usually put it, of course. They tend to use the more soothing phrase "entitlement reform." But entitlement reform is just another way of saying that we can't pay more in benefits than we collect in taxes.
"If the long-term issue is entitlement reform," says Joel Slemrod, a University of Michigan economist, "the fact that the political system cannot say no to $250 checks to elderly people is a bad sign."

The first Social Security check was mailed in 1940 to Ida May Fuller, a retired legal secretary in Ludlow, Vt. It was for $22.54. Every month for the next 10 years, Ms. Fuller received a check for that same amount.
The original Social Security legislation had not included an inflation adjustment, which meant benefits did not keep up with the cost of living. A decade later, Ms. Fuller's checks were worth about 40 percent less in real terms than when she started receiving them.
Congress finally increased benefits in 1950 and then continued to do so in fits and starts, sometimes faster than inflation, sometimes slower and usually in an election year. President Richard M. Nixon and a Democratic Congress brought some order to this process in 1972, by automatically tying benefits to the movement of an inflation index in the previous year.
The changes were part of the transformation, during the middle decades of the 20th century, in how this country treated the elderly. In the 1930s, they had little safety net and frequently struggled to meet their basic needs. Four decades later, they were the only group of Americans with guaranteed health care and a guaranteed income. All in all, it was certainly for the good.
But by the 1970s, you could start to see the early signs of excess. In their bill, Mr. Nixon and Congress included a little bonus: the increase in Social Security payments could never be less than 3 percent, no matter what inflation was. In the 1980s, Congress reduced the floor to zero -- meaning that benefits would be held constant if prices fell -- but the principle remained the same: heads, it's a tie; tails, Social Security recipients win.
This year, the coin finally came up tails.
With oil prices plunging and other prices falling, last year's high inflation (which led to the 5.8 percent increase in Social Security payments) has turned into deflation. Overall prices have dropped 2.1 percent in the last year, according to the relevant price index.
Social Security payments, however, will remain as they were, which means that recipients are already set to receive an effective raise, even without Mr. Obama's $250 checks. No matter what happens with that proposal, 2010 will be the first year since at least the Nixon era that the buying power of an individual worker's Social Security goes up.
Compare that to what's happening with minimum-wage workers in Colorado. Their wage is also tied to inflation, but it has no floor. So it will fall slightly next year, to keep pace with prices.
Now, I understand that there are arguments on the other side of the issue. Lawrence Summers, Mr. Obama's top economics aide, pointed out that the stimulus bill included one-time $250 payments for Social Security recipients, which were sent out this year, but tax cuts for workers both this year and next year. "We're correcting an anomaly," he told me.
Others will argue that the elderly simply need help. Some have been the victim of age discrimination. Too many still live in poverty. All of them are likely to see their Medicare premiums rise in 2010. This recession has spared no group.
But older Americans really have survived the recession better than most.
Many of them started buying assets years if not decades ago, meaning they were not the main victims of the stock and housing bubbles. They had a cushion. In addition, relatively few of them work in manufacturing or construction, the hardest-hit industries.
Just consider: The real median income of over-65 households rose 3 percent from 2000 to 2008. For households headed by somebody age 25 to 44, it fell about 7 percent.
Economic policy, like most everything else, is about making choices. Mr. Obama is choosing the elderly, rich and poor, to be more worthy of $14 billion in government checks than struggling workers or schoolchildren. Republicans have pandered in their own ways, choosing to oppose just about any cut in Medicare and, in effect, to stick your grandchildren with an enormous tax bill.
In a way, I understand where the politicians are coming from. We voters may say that we are in favor of cutting the deficit, but usually mean it in only the theoretical sense. Who wants their own benefits cut? For that matter, who is even willing to have their Social Security checks hold steady?

Full text: It certainly sounded good.
Hoping, perhaps, to persuade a dubious public that curbing reckless business practices is indeed a Washington priority, the Obama administration and Congress produced a hat trick of financial reforms last week. The outlines of a consumer financial protection agency emerged from the House Financial Services Committee. The House Agriculture Committee spelled out ways to regulate risky derivatives trading, and the United States Treasury's compensation czar announced his plan to rein in runaway executive pay at seven companies that, in total, have received hundreds of billions of dollars in taxpayer help within the past year.
Not to be outdone, the Federal Reserve announced plans late Thursday to review pay practices at the nation's largest banks. It all left the question, would it make Wall Street safe for America?
For all the apparent action in Washington, some acute observers say that it was much ado about little. Last week's moves, they say, were tinkering around the edges and did nothing to prevent another disaster like the one that unfolded a year ago.
The white-hot focus on pay, for example, looks like a way for the government to reassure an angry public that they are making genuine changes. But compensation is a trifling matter compared to, say, true reform of derivatives trading.
"The American public understands the immorality of paying people huge bonuses for failures that damaged the economy," said Michael Greenberger, a law professor at the University of Maryland and a former commodities regulator. "What they don't understand is that those payments are only a small fraction of the irregularities that took place and that, in essence, the compensation problems, as bad as they are, are a sideshow to the casino-like nature of the economy as it existed, pre-Lehman Brothers, and as it exists today."
It is difficult enough for seasoned regulators or market professionals to assess whether various reform proposals will close pernicious loopholes and make the financial system safer. But for a crisis-weary public, such an analysis is almost impossible. Much easier to grasp are the cuts to executive pay announced by Kenneth R. Feinberg, the Treasury official in charge of setting compensation at bailed-out companies.
Mr. Feinberg reduced compensation across the board at American International Group, Citigroup, Bank of America, Chrysler, General Motors, GMAC and Chrysler Financial, the companies that received the most government help. He cut average cash payments by more than 90 percent and overall pay by around 50 percent. Trying to discourage the instant-gratification mindset that permeates trading desks and executive suites, Mr. Feinberg also required that the majority of the salaries he oversees be paid in stock that must be held for the long term.
It is certainly worthwhile to reduce outsize pay at companies receiving taxpayer support. But regulating derivatives is far more important to those interested in eliminating the possibility of future billion-dollar bailouts. These financial instruments, which trade privately and beyond the prying eyes of regulators, are central to the interconnectedness among companies that required some of the costliest rescues. American International Group, for example, had to be rescued to cover the costs of insurance it had written for customers intending to protect their mortgage holdings from default. The insurance is a derivative called a credit-default swap. The company has received $170 billion in taxpayer aid.
But the derivatives bill generated by the House Agriculture Committee contains a sizable loophole. It is designed to push the trading of these opaque instruments onto exchanges or clearinghouses where regulators and participants can better assess who is at risk. But the bill would let transactions remain private if they involve nonfinancial companies that are trying to protect against fluctuations in their costs of doing business, a practice known as hedging. For example, when Exxon buys or sells derivatives to hedge against shifts in the price of oil, those transactions would be exempt from having to be traded on an exchange or clearinghouse. Thus, many derivatives would not trade in the light of day.
Such companies argue that trading on an exchange will make their costs rise. But critics of the exemption say that if protecting the system from a meltdown costs participants a bit more, so be it. This last go-round has certainly been expensive for taxpayers, after all.
The consumer financial protection agency moving through Congress would also carve out an exemption that disturbs advocates for borrowers. It means that the agency will not oversee loans provided by auto dealerships.
Travis Plunkett, legislative director at the Consumer Federation of America, said this is akin to exempting mortgage brokers from oversight in real estate finance. "It's crazy to us not to cover the people who are offering the loans, who benefit from the loans and who sometimes have been found to participate in unfair lending," he said.
None of this, mind you, addresses the most significant issue of all: how to make sure that companies do not grow to a point where they become too big or interconnected to be allowed to fail. The man with a plan to resolve that crucial problem is Paul A. Volcker, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve who is revered for crushing the ruinous inflation of the early 1980s.
In an interview last week with The New York Times, Mr. Volcker said the nation's commercial banks should not be allowed to hold and trade risky securities, a practice that generated deep losses for many of them in the credit crunch. The governor of the Bank of England made the same point last week. Separating these operations was the response the United States government took after the Crash of 1929, but today, the administration says it has no plan to break up the banks again in the manner Mr. Volcker suggests.
The former Fed chairman is certainly not alone in his fears about the threat that large institutions still pose. Neil Barofsky, special inspector general of Treasury's Troubled Asset Relief Program, was asked last Wednesday by CNN about the changes being made to ensure that a disaster like the one starting last year would not recur.
"I think actually what's changed is in the other direction," the refreshingly candid Mr. Barofsky said. "These banks that were too big to fail, are now bigger. Government has sponsored and supported several mergers that made them larger. And that guaranteed that implicit guarantee of moral hazard. The idea that the government is not going to let these banks fail, which was implicit a year ago, its now explicit."
Then he added, "So, if anything, not only have there not been any meaningful regulatory reform to make it less likely, in a lot of ways, the governments have made such problems more likely. Potentially, we could be in more danger now than we were a year ago."

Full text: AMERICANS seem to like the idea of broadening health insurance coverage, but they may not want to be forced to buy it. With health care costs high and rising, such government mandates would make many people worse off.
The proposals now before Congress would require just about everyone to buy health insurance or to get it through their employers -- which would generally result in lower wages. In other words, millions of people would be compelled to spend lots of money on something they previously did not want, at least not at prevailing prices.
Estimates of this burden vary, but for a family of four it could range up to $14,000 a year over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Right now, many Americans take the gamble of going without insurance, just as many of us take our chances with how much we drive or how little we exercise.
The paradox is this: Reform advocates start with anecdotes about the underprivileged who are uninsured, then turn around and propose something that would hurt at least some members of that group.
To ease the burdens of the insurance mandate, the reform proposals call for varying levels of subsidy. In some versions, such as the current Senate bill, subsidies are handed out to families with incomes as high as $88,000 a year. How long will it be before just about everyone wants further assistance, and this new form of entitlement spending spins out of control? It's possible to lower insurance subsidies, but then the insurance mandate would impose a bigger burden on the people we are trying to help.
A subtler problem is what economists call "implicit marginal tax rates."
The fiscal reality is that not all income groups can receive equal subsidies; as a family earns more, its subsidy would probably decrease, eventually falling to zero. But then we are taking money away from the poor as they climb into higher income categories. This is a disincentive to earn more, and the strength of the disincentive increases with our initial generosity. For many people, the health insurance aid would phase out when food stamps, housing vouchers and the earned income tax credit also end and the personal income tax kicks in.
This structure of incentives would likely discourage many parents from earning a better life for their children. Congress could tweak the subsidies so they don't phase out so quickly, but then we're back to very high fiscal costs and subsidies for many families in the higher income classes.
Defenders of a broad health insurance mandate argue that it will lower average costs in the health care market. The claim is that many of the uninsured are young, healthy or both, and that bringing them into the insurance pool might lower average premiums by spreading risk across low-cost groups. Yet Massachusetts has had a health insurance mandate for several years and this cost-saving mechanism does not appear to be kicking in.
At this point, it seems more plausible that the cost of health insurance will keep rising, just as the costs of health care services have continued to climb. The upshot is that the burdens of mandatory purchase, the subsidy costs and the associated implicit marginal tax rates will all increase, eventually to the point of unsustainability.
A further problem is "mandate creep," which we've seen at the state level, as groups lobby for various types of coverage -- whether for acupuncture, alcoholism and fertility treatments, for example, or for chiropractor services or marriage counseling.
There are now about 1,500 insurance mandates among the various states, and hundreds of others are under consideration. The dynamic at work here is that the affected groups have a big incentive to push for mandates, while most other people are unaware of the specific issues and don't become involved.
Because mandates don't stay modest for long, health insurance would become all the more expensive. The Obama administration's cost estimates haven't considered these longer-run "political economy" issues.
IF there is a problem with mandates, why do they seem to work in countries like Switzerland and the Netherlands? One answer is that mandates are more effective when health care cost inflation is under control, and both of those countries fare better at technocracy than the larger, less tightly ordered United States.
And mandates also fare better in those nations because of their greater equality of incomes. In other words, it's less of a stretch to offer poorer people coverage that is roughly comparable to that of the wealthy.
If anything, however, European mandates will face growing problems, as health care cost inflation is spreading globally.
We're often told that America should copy the health care institutions of Western Europe. Yet we're failing to copy the single most important lesson from those systems -- namely, to put cost control first. Instead, we're putting our foot on the gas pedal and ratcheting up the fiscal pressures on the system, in the hope that someday, somehow, it will all work out.
As it stands, we're on the verge of enacting a policy that is due to explode, penalizing many of the very people that it was ostensibly designed to help.

Another Growth Spurt For Chinese Economy

Abstract: Many economists argue that the country needs to be weaned off its reliance on exports and that domestic demand needs to be fostered via improved social safety systems, education and health care -- all deemed crucial in encouraging ordinary Chinese citizens to save less and spend more.

Full text: The Chinese economy, already one of the fastest-growing in the world, picked up more speed during the third quarter, adding fuel to a debate over whether, and when, the Chinese authorities might start reining in stimulus measures.
Prompted by vastly increased bank lending, generous government support for exports and a $585 billion stimulus package that is spurring a dizzying array of building projects, the Chinese economy grew 8.9 percent from July to September, up from the year-ago period, according to government figures released Thursday.
Separate economic reports on Thursday also showed that retail sales and industrial output rose markedly in September, helping to offset the slump in exports, a mainstay of the Chinese economy, that has continued unabated for 11 months.
The rate of expansion of gross domestic product jumped from 7.9 percent in the second quarter, putting the nation on target to reach the 8 percent growth level that Chinese economists say is required to maintain healthy employment and social stability.
Although welcome news to the legions of workers who lost their jobs this year, China's recovery has begun to raise some concern about possible inflation and a potentially unsustainable rise in stock markets and property prices.
"The government is quite wary of starting another bubble," said Alistair Chan, an economist at Moody'sEconomy.com.
The state-controlled banking system has given out a record $1.27 trillion in new loans this year, and some analysts have warned that too much of that money has ended up in stocks and real estate.
Property values in mainland China have soared 73 percent this year. And the country's stock market rose 80 percent during the first seven months of 2009 before falling back as bank lending began to retreat to more normal levels and a flood of initial public offerings helped quench the thirst for investments. The Shanghai stock market is still up nearly 67 percent this year.
Despite the emergence of possible bubbles in stocks and property markets, some Chinese officials still warn that the Chinese economy remains on the rocks and that its expansionary policies will remain in place for now.
"China's economy is at a vital moment of recovery and stabilization," Li Xiaochao, spokesman for the National Bureau of Statistics, told journalists in Beijing, according to Reuters. "The foundations of the recovery are still not solid, the pressure on external demand is still serious, and it is still an arduous task for us to expand domestic demand and adjust the structure of the economy."
Exports are a major economic driver. While recovering somewhat, they are well below the level of previous years as Western economies begin to emerge from recession.
As a result, economists do not expect any major steps in monetary or economic policy, like raising interest rates.
"They'll take small, administrative steps," Mr. Chan said. Analysts say that could include increasing the amount of money banks must hold as reserves or cutting back bank lending.
Earlier this month, Australia became the first major economy to raise interest rates again, reversing some of the steep cuts it had made when a recession began in many parts of the world last year.
The rate increase, on Oct. 6, was by a modest one-quarter of a percentage point and left the key rate low. But it showed that some of the world's most resilient economies are now ready to start unwinding some of the extraordinary policy measures they instituted at the height of the global crisis.
The European, Japanese and American economies remain much more feeble than China's, or even Australia's. The United States economy shrank 0.7 percent during the second quarter, and third-quarter figures for the American economy, to be released next week, are expected to show a 3.1 percent annual rate of expansion.
Even in less dynamic economies a policy debate is under way as to whether the time is now ripe to start taking the economy off life support, or whether a precipitous withdrawal of the emergency stimulus measures could risk nipping the recovery in the bud.
The Chinese authorities face the added challenge of rebalancing the economy for the longer term. Many economists argue that the country needs to be weaned off its reliance on exports and that domestic demand needs to be fostered via improved social safety systems, education and health care -- all deemed crucial in encouraging ordinary Chinese citizens to save less and spend more.
The credit crisis caused demand in Europe and the United States to collapse late last year, resulting in a serious decline in exports of goods from Asia.
Although the pace of decline has leveled off, exports remain well below where they were a year ago. Japan, for example, reported Thursday that exports in September were 30.7 percent lower than September 2008 levels.
Mr. Chan said the data from Thursday show China has "gotten over their initial problem, but at the end of the day, the economy still depends on exports to the U.S."

Abstract: Over the last seven months, the dollar's value has declined more than 15 percent as federal deficits in the United States rose to record levels, stirring fears that the government's aggressive efforts to combat the recession would weaken the American currency and swamp global markets with Treasury bonds.

Full text: As the dollar fell to $1.50 against the euro on Wednesday, its lowest level in more than a year, concerns swirled for businesses and policy makers on both sides of the Atlantic.
For the United States, a weakening currency makes foreign-made goods more expensive, and it raises troubling questions about whether the primacy of the dollar is being eclipsed by gold, oil and other currencies. For the 16 countries in the euro zone, a stronger euro puts exporters and manufacturers in countries like Spain, Germany and Greece at a disadvantage and could slow the flow of American tourists to European shores.
Stocks, meanwhile, sold off broadly on Wall Street after a noted banking analyst downgraded Wells Fargo to sell. On the flip side, the losses helped to cut some of the dollar's earlier losses.
Over the last seven months, the dollar's value has declined more than 15 percent as federal deficits in the United States rose to record levels, stirring fears that the government's aggressive efforts to combat the recession would weaken the American currency and swamp global markets with Treasury bonds.
Now, inflation-wary investors have gone hunting for stronger returns by funneling their money into countries where interest rates are higher than the record low rates in the United States, or where rates seem poised to rise sooner. Interest rates are hovering near zero in the United States, and central bankers say they are unlikely to budge anytime soon.
Investors have also migrated from the perceived safety of the dollar into the stock markets, and they have snapped up gold, oil and other hard assets.
As the dollar weakened, oil prices rose sharply to breach $80 for the first time since October 2008, settling at $81.37, setting the stage for higher gasoline prices in the United States.
The latest dip in the dollar came as shares on Wall Street fell for a second consecutive day, and the governor of the Bank of England cautioned that the days of abnormally low interest rates would not continue forever.
Investors are using the dollar's weakness to capitalize on the so-called carry trade, which allows them to borrow dollars and use them to buy currencies in countries with higher interest rates. As governments like Australia begin to raise rates in the wake of the financial crisis, some analysts say the disparity between the dollar and other currencies could continue to grow.
"The divide between the central banks has become much clearer," said Steven Englander of Barclays Capital. "That's separating the men from the boys in terms of who is optimistic about growth and optimistic enough to actually act on it."
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 92.12 points, or 0.9 percent, to 9,949.36. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was 0.9 percent, or 9.66 points, lower, at 1,081.40, and the Nasdaq composite was down 0.6 percent, or 12.74 points, at 2,150.73.
Financial firms tugged the broader markets lower. Shares of Wells Fargo, which reported a third-quarter profit on Wednesday, closed down 5 percent. Analysts said that a new report detailing executive pay restrictions at seven companies that received government bailouts also seemed to drive investors out of bank stocks.
If consumer spending stays weak and government stimulus spending eases over the next year, rising exports, fed by a cheap dollar, may be one of the only sources of economic expansion.
"The U.S. dollar has to decline," said Martin Murenbeeld, chief economist at Dundee Wealth. "For any kind of growth to develop in the United States economy once the government has stopped pumping the system, you're going to have to have something happen on the foreign trade system."
The Treasury's 10-year note fell 12/32, to 101 31/32. The yield rose to 3.39 percent, from 3.34 percent late Tuesday.
Following are the results of Wednesday's Treasury auction of 42-day cash management bills:

Abstract: In September, gasoline prices at the producer level fell by 5.4 percent, making up nearly 80 percent of the overall decline. Since the start of October, crude oil prices have risen more than 10 percent in New York markets as the value of the dollar slipped to its lowest levels of the year.

Full text: Even as investors were bidding up the prices of commodities like oil and gold last month, wholesale prices in the United States were falling, reflecting weak demand at home.
The government's Producer Price Index fell 0.6 percent in September after rising by 1.7 percent a month earlier, the Labor Department reported on Tuesday. The figures show that, despite a weakening dollar, inflation remains a remote concern as the American economy struggles to pull itself out of a deep recession.
"The demand for goods is still very soft; the United States economy is just barely recovering," said Allen Sinai, president of Decision Economics. "In a weak economy where consumer spending is weak, businesses have been slashing left and right. This surprisingly deflationary result reflects that."
Food and energy prices fell for the month, and prices were sharply lower than last year, when the financial crisis deflated a commodities bubble that had lifted gasoline prices to $4 a gallon and sent the dollar to record lows. In September, producer prices were down 4.8 percent from a year ago, and prices paid by consumers were 1.3 percent lower.
Last week, the Labor Department reported that consumer prices rose 0.2 percent in September from a month earlier, reflecting small increases in energy prices.
In the latest report on prices received at the wholesale level, the government said that prices for crude goods fell 2.1 percent, showing that there was little inflation further down the ladder of production.
So-called core producer prices, which exclude volatile food and energy costs, fell by 0.1 percent in September, their third monthly decline of the year.
But some economists said wholesale prices would probably head higher for October as the government's data collectors captured the rising prices of gasoline and crude oil. In September, gasoline prices at the producer level fell by 5.4 percent, making up nearly 80 percent of the overall decline.
Since the start of October, crude oil prices have risen more than 10 percent in New York markets as the value of the dollar slipped to its lowest levels of the year. Gasoline prices at the pump have risen by 10 cents in the last week, to a nationwide average of $2.58 a gallon, according to AAA, the automobile group.
Despite these increases, policy makers at the Federal Reserve say they believe that inflation will remain muted in the months ahead. With 15 million people out of work, consumer demand shaky and businesses operating at reduced capacity, there is still an enormous amount of slack in the economy.
"The biggest factor for inflation will be the level of slack," said James F. O'Sullivan, chief economist at MF Global. "That's going to keep downward pressure on inflation." The price data coincided with a report from the Commerce Department that construction of new homes rose by 0.5 percent in September to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 590,000. The figures showed that the housing market was continuing to make a tentative recovery because of lower prices and a government tax credit for first-time home buyers.
But despite some stability in home sales and prices, potential buyers are still circling the edges of the market, and many builders are still unable to get financing to break ground on new projects.
"Gains from here on will probably be much more difficult to achieve, as poor labor market conditions, tight credit, overly leveraged household balance sheets, and still considerable inventory of new and existing homes all exert downside pressures," Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist at MFR, wrote in a research note.
The number of housing starts was 28 percent lower than a year ago, and new building permits in September fell by 1.2 percent from August to a seasonally adjusted 580,000. The number of building permits issued in September was down nearly 30 percent from last year.

Full text: How much debt can an industrialized country carry before the nation's economy and its currency bow, then break?
The question looms large in the United States, as a surging budget deficit pushes government debt to nearly 98 percent of the gross domestic product. But it looms even larger in Japan.
Here, years of stimulus spending on expensive dams and roads have inflated the country's gross public debt to twice the size of its $5 trillion economy -- by far the highest debt-to-G.D.P. ratio in recent memory.
Just paying the interest on its debt consumed a fifth of Japan's budget for 2008, compared with debt payments that compose about a tenth of the United States budget.
Yet, the finance minister, Hirohisa Fujii, suggested Tuesday that the government would sell 50 trillion yen, about $550 billion, in new bonds -- or more.
"There's no mistaking the budget deficit stems from the past year's global recession. Now is the time to be bold and issue more deficit bonds," Mr. Fujii told reporters at the National Press Club in Tokyo. "Those who may call this pork-barrel spending -- that's a total lie."
For jittery investors, Japan's rising sea of debt is the stuff of nightmares: the possibility of an eventual sovereign debt crisis, where the country would be unable to pay some holders of its bonds, or a destabilizing collapse in the value of the yen.
In the immediate term, Mr. Fujii's remarks prompted concerns of a supply glut in bond markets, sending prices on 10-year Japanese government bonds down 0.087 yen, to 99.56 yen, and yields to their highest point in six weeks.
The Obama administration insists that it understands the risks posed by deficits and ever-increasing debt. Its critics are doubtful. But as Washington runs up a trillion-dollar deficit this year, with trillions in debt for years to come, it need look no farther than Tokyo to see how overspending can ravage an economy.
Tokyo's new government, which won a landslide victory on an ambitious (and expensive) social agenda, is set to issue a record amount of debt, borrowing more in government bonds than it will receive in tax receipts for the first time since the years after World War II.
"Public sector finances are spinning out of control -- fast," said Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics in a recent note to clients. "We believe a fiscal crisis is imminent."
One of the lessons of Japan's experience is that a government saddled with debt can quickly run out of room to maneuver.
"Japan will keep on selling more bonds this year and next, but that won't work in three to five years," said Akito Fukunaga, a Tokyo-based fixed-income strategist at Credit Suisse. "If you ask me what Japan can resort to after that, my answer would be 'not very much.' "
How Japan got into such a deep hole, and kept digging, is a tale of reckless spending.
The country poured hundreds of billions of dollars into civil engineering projects in the postwar era, marbling Japan with highways, dams and ports.
The spending initially fueled Japan's rapid postwar growth and kept the Liberal Democratic Party in power for most of the last half-century. But after a spectacular asset and stock market boom collapsed in 1990, the country fell into a long economic malaise.
The Democratic Party, which swept to victory in August, promises to rein in public works spending. But the party's generous welfare agenda -- like cash support to families with children and free high schools -- could ultimately enlarge budget deficits.
"It's dangerous for the Democrats to push on with all of their policies when tax revenues are so low," said Chotaro Morita, head of fixed-income strategy at Barclays Capital Japan. "From a global perspective, Japan's debt ratio is way off the charts," he said.
Still, officials insist that Japan is better off than the United States by some measures.
One hugely important difference is that Japan is rich in personal savings and assets, and owes less than 10 percent of its debt to foreigners. By comparison, about 46 percent of America's debt is held overseas by countries such as China and Japan.
Moreover, half of Japan's government bonds are held by the public sector, while government regulations encourage long-term investors like banks, pension funds and insurance companies to buy up the rest.
All of this makes a sudden sell-off of government bonds unlikely, officials argue.
"The government is just borrowing from one pocket and putting it in the other," said Toyoo Gyohten, a former top finance ministry official and a special currency adviser to Mr. Fujii. "Although the numbers appear very fearsome, we have some leeway."
Many analysts agree that during a recession, Japan, like the United States, should worry less about trying to cut debt. But they say Tokyo should at least concentrate on making sure that spending does not get out of hand.
"The government needs to stabilize the debt, first and foremost. Only then can it start setting other targets," said Randall Jones, chief economist for Japan and Korea at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
A credible plan to pare down spending is important "to maintain public confidence in Japan's fiscal sustainability," said the O.E.C.D.'s economic survey of Japan for 2009.
In the long run, even Japan's sizable assets could fall and eventually turn negative. Japan's rapidly aging population means retirees are starting to dip into their nest eggs -- just as government spending increases to cover their rising medical bills and pension payments.
The fall in public and private savings could eventually reverse Japan's current account surplus, possibly driving up interest rates as the public and private sectors compete for funds. Higher interest rates would increase the cost of servicing the debt, and raise Japan's risk of default.
In a worst case, Japan's currency could suffer as more investors switch away from Japan to other assets. And if Japan were to print more money and set off inflation to reduce its debt burden, the supply of yen would shoot up, lowering the currency's value further.
In recent months, the yen's surge on major markets as the dollar weakened has sent a false sense of security. The currency recently touched a seven-month high of about 89 yen to the dollar before easing slightly, as near-zero interest rates in the United States prompted investors to take their money elsewhere. Many strategists expect the yen to strengthen further, at least in the short term.
"In 10 or 20 years, Japan's current-account surplus will fall into deficit, and that will lead to a weaker yen," said Mr. Morita at Barclays Capital. "But if investors become pessimistic about Japan before that, the yen will weaken earlier than that."
For all the recent talk of a shift away from the dollar as the reserve currency of choice, it is the yen that is becoming increasingly irrelevant, analysts say. The yen made up 3.08 percent of foreign currency reserves in mid-2009, down from 3.29 percent the same time last year and down from 6.4 percent in 1999. In mid-2009, the dollar still accounted for almost 63 percent of global foreign reserves.
"The yen is set to enter a long decline" in both stature and value as investors lose confidence in Japan, said Hideo Kumano, chief economist at the Dai-Ichi Life Research Institute in Tokyo.
Considering the state of Japan's finances and economy, Mr. Kumano said, the yen's recent strength against the dollar "isn't an affirmation of Japan -- it's the yen's last hurrah."

Abstract: Most pay a lower net cost because they get some kind of assistance, whether in the form of a scholarship from the university, a federal Pell grant or state aid. The really interesting thing to me, she said, is if you look at net prices students pay, considering the grant aid and tax benefits, students at public two-year institutions are actually paying less, in inflation-adjusted dollars.

Full text: The price of a college education rose substantially last year, despite a 2.1 percent decline in the Consumer Price Index from July 2008 to July 2009.
Hit hard by state budget cuts, four-year public colleges raised tuition and fees by an average of 6.5 percent last year. Prices at private colleges rose 4.4 percent, according to a report issued Tuesday by the College Board.
Patrick Callan, president of the National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education, called the increases "hugely disappointing."
"Given the financial hardship of the country, it's simply astonishing that colleges and universities would have this kind of increases," Mr. Callan said. "It tells you that higher education is still a seller's market. The level of debt we're asking people to undertake is unsustainable.
"A lot of people think we can solve the problem with more financial aid, but I think we have to have some cost containment. For all the talk about reinventing higher education, I don't see any results."
With room and board, the average total cost of attendance at a public four-year college is now $15,213, the report found. At private nonprofit colleges, which enroll about one in five college students nationally, the average total cost of attendance is now $35,636.
Over the last 30 years, college costs have risen steadily, especially at four-year public universities, once considered the affordable route to higher education. At such universities, the last decade's increases, adjusted for inflation, have been the steepest.
At private universities and public two-year institutions, the rate of increase has slowed over the last decade. The 4.4 percent rise in tuition at private colleges last year, for example, was smaller than in past years, when it has been about 6 percent.
In releasing the figures, the College Board, a membership organization made up of schools, colleges, universities and education organizations, put a bright face on the issue. Sandy Baum, the senior policy analyst who wrote the report, "Trends in College Pricing 2009," said the findings were not as bad as they might have been, since in times of recession, tuition increases are often "really, really steep."
Ms. Baum emphasized that it was important for families to understand that only about a third of students pay the published tuition, or sticker price. Most pay a lower net cost because they get some kind of assistance, whether in the form of a scholarship from the university, a federal Pell grant or state aid.
Nonetheless, Ms. Baum acknowledged that over time, the costs trends at four-year public universities have been troubling.
"From 1979 to 1989, the annual rate adjusted for inflation was 3 percent," she said, "the next decade was 4 percent, and the most recent decade 5 percent. So the trend was exacerbated in recent years."
Public universities have been forced to raise tuition largely because state governments, facing huge budget shortfalls, have reduced spending on higher education. But many education experts said colleges must do a better job of cutting costs.
"Colleges need to be looking for ways to permanently restructure, not just cut their budgets," said Jane Wellman, executive director of the Delta Project on Postsecondary Costs, Productivity and Accountability. "A perfect example is furloughs, in hopes that eventually the work force can come back. But this isn't a one-time problem, and eventually they'll have to bite the bullet and reduce their work force."
About two-thirds of full-time undergraduates receive grants, according to "Trends in Student Aid 2009," a companion College Board report by Ms. Baum that was also released Tuesday. And grant aid, especially Pell grants, has been growing.
Taking into account both grant aid and tax credits and deductions, Ms. Baum said, the situation looks far less dire.
"The really interesting thing to me," she said, "is if you look at net prices students pay, considering the grant aid and tax benefits, students at public two-year institutions are actually paying less, in inflation-adjusted dollars. And that's pretty significant. Even though the sticker price, adjusting for inflation, is up 20 percent in the past five years, the net price is actually lower than it was five years ago."
But with college costs so high, borrowing is increasing as well. Although grant aid rose significantly in the 2008-9 school year, the latest year for which data are available, student borrowing -- and the gap between available resources and the overall cost of attending college -- continued to increase, the report said.
The borrowing has changed, though, with a significant shift away from private loans as the credit markets froze and federal loans expanded. According to the new report, total education borrowing increased 5 percent from 2007-8 to 2008-9, the report said, but private loans declined by about half last year, to about $11 billion, while federal loans increased by about $15 billion.
Last year, the average grant aid per student was $5,041, with the largest amounts coming from colleges and universities and the federal government.
At public four-year colleges, the report found, two-thirds of the grant money is given as merit aid, that is, without considering the recipient's financial need.
"It is particularly disturbing that public colleges are using such a large share of their financial aid resources for so-called merit aid in these tough times," said Lauren Asher, president of the Institute for College Access and Success.
This year, the report found, full-time students at private, nonprofit four-year institutions -- those with the most expensive tuition -- are receiving about $14,400 in grant aid and federal tax benefits, reducing their net tuition and fees to about $11,900, from the published $26,300.
Full-time students at public four-year colleges and universities receive an estimated average of about $5,400 in grant aid and federal tax benefits, reducing their net tuition and fees to about $1,600, from the published $7,000.
And full-time students at public two-year colleges actually get an average $3,000 in grant aid and tax benefits -- enough to pay the average $2,500 tuition and fees and still have $500 left toward living expenses.

Full text: The basic Medicare premium will shoot up next year by 15 percent, to $110.50 a month, federal officials said Monday.
The increase means that monthly premiums would top $100 for the first time, a stark indication of the rise in medical costs that is driving the debate in Congress about a broad overhaul of the health care system.
About 12 million people, or 27 percent of Medicare beneficiaries, will have to pay higher premiums or have the additional amounts paid on their behalf. The other 73 percent will be shielded from the increase because, under federal law, their Medicare premiums cannot go up more than the increase in their Social Security benefits, and Social Security officials announced last week that there would be no increase in benefits in 2010 because inflation had been extremely low.
Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services, urged the Senate to approve a bill, already passed by the House, to block the scheduled increase in Medicare premiums.
"We are in tremendously difficult economic times, and seniors are being hit particularly hard," Ms. Sebelius said. "The last thing seniors need right now is a substantial increase in their Medicare premiums, and many seniors will see such an increase if no action is taken."
Among those who face higher premiums next year are new Medicare beneficiaries, high-income people and those whose Medicare premiums are paid by Medicaid. Premiums can be as high as $353.60 a month, or more than $4,200 a year, for Medicare beneficiaries who file tax returns with adjusted gross income greater than $214,000 for an individual or $428,000 for a couple.
The higher premiums will impose "an additional and significant burden" on states, which help pay Medicaid costs, along with the federal government.
The House bill was passed, 406 to 18, on Sept. 24. Among those who voted against it was the Democratic leader, Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, who said he saw no need to help multimillionaires at a time when the nation was struggling to rein in entitlement programs.
While lawmakers considered whether to freeze Medicare premiums, a handful of senators met behind closed doors on Monday to work out a compromise health care bill to cover the uninsured.
One participant, Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana and chairman of the Finance Committee, said senators were considering new ideas to finesse disagreements over whether the government should offer its own health insurance plan, in competition with private insurers.
Under one proposal, he said, the government would create a public plan, but states could "opt out" if they wanted to devise and operate their own insurance programs.
The meeting, convened by the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, included Mr. Baucus and Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, who presided over the health committee when it approved a sweeping health care bill in July.
Mr. Reid said he hoped to take a compromise bill to the Senate floor early next month. But that assumes rapid progress in negotiations and a quick analysis by the Congressional Budget Office, to confirm whether the 10-year cost of the bill is under the $900 billion ceiling set by President Obama.
The Finance Committee approved a detailed outline of a sweeping health care bill last week. Mr. Baucus formally introduced the bill, a 1,502-page document, on Monday.
The Senate is debating a separate bill to prevent deep cuts in Medicare payments to doctors. The bill would not offset any of the costs, estimated at $247 billion over the next 10 years.
Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, the No. 3 Republican in the Senate, said: "Of course, we need to fix doctors' reimbursement. But it needs to be paid for. We can't just add a quarter-trillion dollars to the national debt."
Democrats said the bill simply recognized political reality. In recent years, they said, Congress has repeatedly stepped in to prevent cuts in Medicare payments to doctors, and it is likely to do so in the future.

Abstract: Over the last year, the Fed has injected hundreds of billions of dollars into the economy by buying up mortgage-backed loans and government debts, opening up low-cost loans to financial companies and pumping money into the markets for securities backed by commercial loans.

Full text: Wall Street bounded ahead on Monday as investors bet that another round of strong corporate earnings would propel the markets even higher. Better earnings by the toymaker Hasbro, coming on the heels of a stronger-than-expected retail sales report from the government, helped to strengthen hopes that people were again spending money on nonessentials as the economy healed. Intel has said that computer sales are rebounding and sales at Apple, the maker of iPods and iPhones, topped expectations when the company reported a profit after markets closed on Monday.
Hasbro was down 3.7 percent, to $28.42 a share, after reporting results that included a 2 percent decline in sales.
Nevertheless, consumer stocks helped to lead the gains throughout the day. Investors snapped up shares of department stores, hotel and entertainment companies, and of office-supply companies like Office Depot.
"The consumer does appear to be willing to spend," said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at Standard & Poor's. "They're not totally retrenched."
Last week, the government reported that retail sales excluding automobiles rose 0.5 percent in September, even as overall sales dipped with the end of the government's cash-for-clunkers auto rebate program. Economists were encouraged by the gains because they came as unemployment rose to new highs and thousands more homeowners fell behind on their mortgages. The Dow Jones industrial average, which wobbled last week after crossing 10,000, rose 96.28 points, or almost 1 percent, to close at 10,092.19 , and the wider Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed 10.23 points, or 0.9 percent, to 1,097.91. The Nasdaq was about 0.9 percent higher at 2,176.32.
On a day with so few new economic figures, some analysts were perplexed by the market's gains, suggesting that money was overflowing from safer reservoirs like money-market funds as investors anticipated another week of gains.
Stock indexes rose more than 1 percent last week after the big banks JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs reported eye-popping profits while Bank of America and Citigroup groaned under the weight of their consumer banking portfolios.
"It's more of the same silliness," said Joe Saluzzi, co-head of equity trading at Themis Trading. "I think it's price-chasing. Price does not equal value." Gannett, the publisher of USA Today and other newspapers, said profit fell 53 percent and revenue was down 18 percent. Advertising sales were down 28 percent, but the decline was less than in the previous two quarters and Gannett's stock rose 8.2 percent, to $14.06 a share.
The Federal Reserve helped to stoke optimism by announcing that it was testing mechanisms that could be used to scale back the government's presence in the financial markets. The New York Fed said it could use so-called reverse repurchase agreements to reel in its support measures.
Over the last year, the Fed has injected hundreds of billions of dollars into the economy by buying up mortgage-backed loans and government debts, opening up low-cost loans to financial companies and pumping money into the markets for securities backed by commercial loans.
But as the economy improves, some economists and investors are beginning to wonder whether the Fed can reel in its monetary policies gently enough to avoid knocking the economy back to its knees. In currency markets, the dollar fell for another day against major world currencies, hitting a new low for the year as investors migrated to inflation-resistant investments like gold, and dived into other currency markets. The dollar fell to $1.49 against the euro.
Oil, gold and other currencies have eclipsed the value of the dollar in recent weeks on growing fears that the United States is running up uncontrollable deficits, and that the recovery in the American economy will lag growth in Asian markets. In a speech on Monday, the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said the United States needed to put its finances in order.
"The United States must increase its national saving rate," he said. "The most effective way to accomplish this goal is by establishing a sustainable fiscal trajectory, anchored by a clear commitment to substantially reduce federal deficits over time."
The Treasury's 10-year note rose 6/32, to 101 30/32. The yield fell to 3.39 percent, from 3.41 percent Friday.
Following are the results of Monday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:

In Dollar's Fall, Upside For Exports

Abstract: Most ominously, many foreign central banks are rethinking the dollar's status as the world's premier reserve currency, said Neil Mellor, a currency strategist at BNY Mellon Global Markets in London.

Full text: As economists, pundits and politicians debate the reasons for the dollar's rapid fall, Robert Stevenson and his workers in downtown Buffalo, N.Y., watch the slide with glee.
Mr. Stevenson's family-owned company, Eastman Machine, has been making cutting tools for the textile industry for 120 years. A year ago, in the depths of the financial crisis, Mr. Stevenson had to lay off a dozen workers, but the dollar's almost 20 percent decline since March has made his goods much more competitive overseas. Next month, Mr. Stevenson hopes to sign a multimillion-dollar deal in Europe that could enable him to rehire his workers.
"This wouldn't have happened five years ago, or even two years ago," he said. "Business conditions are still slow but the dollar has allowed us to be much more aggressive overseas."
The story of Eastman Machine is a small echo of the larger shifts accompanying the dollar's fastest drop in six years; last week the dollar neared $1.50 against the euro, compared with $1.25 in March. The weakness of the dollar, if sustained, could force American consumers to get used to paying more for many imported goods as well as trips to their favorite vacation spots.
But there is also an upside: a weak dollar could prove beneficial to the American economy by aiding long-suffering manufacturers, rebuilding a stronger industrial base and lifting exports even if it makes life harder for trading partners around the world, especially in Europe.
"As long as it doesn't crash, a gradual, orderly decline is healthy," said C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Peterson Institute for International Economics. "The dollar went up 40 percent between 1995 and 2002, so this is a necessary rebalancing."
It is a highly charged political issue, and the sinking American currency has already spurred attacks on the Obama administration from Sarah Palin, the former Republican nominee for vice president, and others in her party who argue that a weaker dollar points to a weaker America.
"We lose our position as the world leader if the dollar is no longer the currency of favor," said Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate. He pointed out that he was critical of President George W. Bush for letting the dollar fall, too, "but this administration is making things worse by its spending and deficit policies."
Most ominously, many foreign central banks are rethinking the dollar's status as the world's premier reserve currency, said Neil Mellor, a currency strategist at BNY Mellon Global Markets in London. That, in addition to domestic factors like historically low United States interest rates and a ballooning federal budget deficit, are worsening the dollar's downward movement.
In addition, while the Obama administration maintains that it favors a strong dollar, it has shown no sign of taking any major steps to support the currency.
Whatever the politics, the economics are complex. Over the long term, a weaker dollar could narrow the long-running United States trade deficit, helping close the gap between exports and imports, as American products become more affordable overseas.
But that comes at a price -- higher costs at home for imported goods as diverse as Italian suits, French wines and Japanese stereos and cameras, as well as more prosaic commodities like oil. The dollar's drop is a central factor in oil's recent rise back above $75 a barrel, which will mean higher gasoline prices.
The dollar has moved sharply before. Most recently, it weakened in the summer of 2008, only to strengthen drastically after the collapse of Lehman Brothers a year ago sent investors worldwide fleeing to the relative security of American assets like Treasury bonds.
Now, the political arguments over the dollar's trajectory are accompanied by a fierce debate among economists.
"Dollar weakness is a major problem for American jobs and living standards," said David Malpass, a longtime Wall Street economist who has been among the most outspoken critics of the dollar's decline.
"As the dollar devalues, we have less capital and purchasing power compared to the rest of the world, and there is an increasing risk of higher interest rates and inflation," Mr. Malpass said.
But Mr. Bergsten argues the dollar is only now getting back to a fair valuation against other currencies if the United States is to continue to close its trade gap.
With the recent drop, he said, the dollar is fairly valued against the euro but needs to ease 10 percent against Asian currencies like the Japanese yen to create a level playing field for American business.
And for all the fluctuations against the dollar by major currencies, the dollar has not moved at all recently against the Chinese renminbi, which is managed by Beijing in ways that allow Chinese exporters to enjoy a weaker currency and gain market share worldwide.
The Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, has consistently said the administration favors a strong dollar, but currency markets focus on the unlikely prospect of concrete action, like an interest rate increase.
"The Obama administration may say they want a strong dollar," Mr. Mellor said. "But everyone knows they haven't got the means to support it. The Federal Reserve can't raise rates, and the White House can't cut the budget deficit anytime soon."
If the dollar does keep falling and the euro keeps rising, it could increase trade tensions with Europe, especially big exporters like Germany, which have already been hard hit by the global economic slump.
"The strength of the euro is coming at absolutely the wrong time," said Jens Nagel, head of the international department of the German Exporters Association in Berlin. "The U.S. is our biggest trading partner after the European Union, and it's a big blow to the recovery of auto companies and industrial exporters."
Mr. Mellor predicts the dollar will keep dropping, reaching $1.60 against the euro by early next year. And, there are signs that even much bigger companies than Eastman Machine are adapting.
As the global economy recovers and international manufacturers ramp up output, they are giving priority to their more competitive plants, including those in the United States, said Pierre Dufour, senior executive vice president at Air Liquide, a French supplier of industrial gases to steelmakers, semiconductor firms, and other industrial giants worldwide.
"It has two sides, like it always does," said Carl Martin Welcker, owner of a machine tools maker, Schutte, in Cologne, Germany.
"On the one hand, it makes our machines significantly more expensive," said Mr. Welcker, whose equipment churns out 80 percent of the world's spark plugs. "On the other hand, we're seeing international companies move production back to the U.S., which helps our sales there."

Full text: "Dow at 10,000 as Crisis Ebbs"
-- Wall Street Journal headline on Thursday
In January 1931, a lawyer named Benjamin Roth, 38 years old, solidly Republican, a solo practitioner in Youngstown, Ohio, decided to start a diary. Realizing that he was "living through an historic thing that will long be remembered" -- as he put it in one early entry -- he wanted to keep a record for posterity.
Mr. Roth's diaries have just been published in book form -- "The Great Depression: A Diary" -- edited by his son Daniel, who worked in his father's law practice for many years, and James Ledbetter, the editor of The Big Money, a financial site run by Slate. It is an eye-opening read, though not necessarily in the ways you might think.
Because it was written in the 1930s, Mr. Roth's diary is not the kind of tell-all we've come to expect in this less restrained age. Although he mentions repeatedly the struggles of lawyers and other "professional men" during the depression -- Mr. Roth always uses the lower-case "d" -- he never shares how his family struggled through it, or how he was able to send his daughter to college in 1937. (Daniel Roth told me that his father, who died in 1978, later divulged that he had had a good life insurance policy, which he borrowed against to keep food on the table.)
Instead, every few days -- or every few weeks during some stretches -- Mr. Roth jotted down his thoughts and fears as the Depression deepened. "Banks are absolutely terrible in their insistence on payments of notes and mortgages," he wrote in 1931. "It is the old story of lending you an umbrella when the sun is shining and then demanding it back when it rains."
He recounts painful conversations with friends and acquaintances who had accumulated some wealth by speculating in the stock market, and then lost everything when stocks plummeted and they couldn't meet margin calls. He is obsessed with the stock market; he is constantly noting the prices of the blue chips of his day, and his writing shows him to have the instincts of a good value investor, a term that hadn't yet been invented. But, as he also constantly points out, he never has any money to invest, much to his chagrin.
Mr. Roth is horrified when the local banks fail ("I still cannot believe that the Dollar Bank -- the Gibraltar of Youngstown -- has closed its doors") and points out that even after the banks reopen, customers aren't allowed to withdraw more than a small fraction of their savings. He explains how entrepreneurs with money buy up people's frozen passbook accounts for 50 cents on the dollar and how barter and scrip come to replace the money people no longer have.
Events that we know about from the history books he was reacting to in real time. He was furious to learn, thanks to a series of highly publicized Congressional hearings, that some of the nation's most prominent bankers did terrible things during the Roaring Twenties. ("By manipulation the officers boosted and unloaded on the public their own stock in National City Bank as high as $650 per share when its book value was only $60.") But he makes no mention of the Securities and Exchange Commission, whose birth was the direct result of those incendiary hearings.
Mr. Roth is skeptical of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal programs, and worries that the president's fondness for deficit spending will ultimately be disastrous. He keeps thinking inflation is right around the corner. He worries about the rise of Hitler. He writes about gangs of farmers who threaten sheriffs, judges and anyone else who tries to foreclose on a farm. He watches the rise of unions, another trend he finds troubling.
Mr. Roth, of course, is writing without the benefit of hindsight. Today, when we look back on the Great Depression, we have a clear narrative in mind -- a narrative that has been fine-tuned this last year or so, as we've re-examined it through the prism of the current crisis. On Wednesday, for instance, I attended a forum at Columbia University, where one of the speakers was the historian Alan Brinkley, who has written several fine books about the Depression.
"The only way to break the economic deadlock brought on by the Depression was to shock it back to life," said Mr. Brinkley, who then added that for all of Roosevelt's willingness to experiment and spend, the reason the Depression lasted so long was that the president didn't spend enough.
That, of course, is what most people believe today -- and that dogma is the reason the government last year threw literally trillions of dollars at the banking system to keep it from collapsing.
Mr. Roth's diaries have no narrative. But they are compelling reading nonetheless, because they force readers to reflect on both the similarities and the differences between then and now. What particularly struck me was watching Mr. Roth, in his diaries, grope from day to day, and year to year, searching for an answer that wouldn't be clear until long afterward. He's like the proverbial blind man who feels an elephant's trunk and thinks elephants look like a rope. Not unlike the way we are today, as we grope our way through our own financial crisis.
Mr. Roth's inflation fears are one good example. A rock-ribbed Republican, he can't understand why Roosevelt's New Deal programs -- and the spending they require -- don't bring with them the kind of scary inflation that had occurred in Germany after World War I. He keeps waiting for it, predicting it, ever fearful that it will make an awful economic situation even worse. He is baffled that inflation remained subdued. He can't get outside of his mental framework and see -- as we can today -- that Roosevelt's programs are the only things keeping the economy alive.
But an even more wrenching example of his groping in the dark is his desperate wish for the Depression to end. His diaries are filled with tentative predictions, usually based on experts' opinions, that the worst is over. Yet every time he thinks that, he turns out to be wrong. He begins studying the charts of previous Depressions to see how long they lasted. "I have done considerable reading about the depressions of 1837 and 1873 and I am struck by the similarity to the present crisis," he writes in early 1933. "If history repeats itself then we still have 2 or 3 years of bad times ahead."
At various points in the early 1930s, the stock market spikes -- and he starts to think it's a good time to buy stocks. Indeed, he writes, many experts are advising people to get into the market, and some of his wealthier friends do so. But six months later, the experts invariably turn out to be wrong, and his friends wind up losing their money. During the Depression, optimism was ruinous.
And yet -- and this is something we tend to forget -- between 1935 and 1937, business began to boom again, and a sense of growing prosperity took hold in the country. In Youngstown, the steel and rubber factories were operating at near capacity, just as they had in the 1920s. On Christmas Eve in 1936, Mr. Roth wrote: "Just came back thru the stores on my lunch hour. People are spending like drunken sailors."
A week later, he added, "It seems to me that the time has come where we can formally and officially announce that the depression of 1929 has ended."
This, of course, turned out to be completely wrong. That September, the market crashed, and the Depression took hold once again. Today, most economists believe that the downturn was caused by Roosevelt, who turned off the spigot too soon, trying to balance the budget instead of continuing to pump money into the economy. Not understanding the reason for the downturn, Mr. Roth was deeply discouraged by the reappearance of the Depression. "It is terrible to contemplate that we are in the 9th year of depression and still cannot see clearly ahead," he wrote in March 1939.
A few months later, he wrote: "As I re-read some of the predictions made by outstanding economists in past few years, I must laugh. They were all wrong. None of them foresaw the 1937-1939 collapse and many predicted inflation before this." Mr. Roth comes to the conclusion that relying on experts is a waste of time.
Today, we're all a little like Benjamin Roth, asking questions we don't know the answer to, and wondering, as he did 70 years ago, whether the crisis is, indeed, over.
Maybe the fact that the Dow crossed the 10,000 mark this week really does signal that the crisis has ebbed, as The Journal put it on Thursday. Or maybe the poor earnings by Bank of America and Citigroup this week suggest we're merely in the eye of the hurricane, as 1935 and 1936 turned out to be.
There are plenty of experts who will tell you the worst is over, and I hope they're right. But as Mr. Roth discovered in the 1930s, the experts can't predict the future any better than the rest of us. When you are living through a financial crisis, all you can do is wait and see. Governments take action they hope will have the desired effect -- but who knows if they really will? It only becomes clear much later, and far too late for those of us living through it.
On that same day in early 1937 that Mr. Roth mistakenly wrote that the Depression had ended, he concluded that instead of relying on experts, the only proper course was to "use your own judgment and do your own thinking."
In the fall of 2009, those remain words to live by.

Full text: Consumer prices edged higher last month after a summertime spike in gasoline and energy prices leveled off, the government reported on Thursday.
The report demonstrated that inflation was still a remote concern for the American economy, even as the dollar tumbles against other global currencies and jittery investors clamor to buy oil and gold. The figures backed up the Federal Reserve's view that inflation will remain low as the economy grapples with high unemployment and low consumer demand.
The Labor Department's consumer price index rose 0.2 percent in September, its smallest increase since July, when prices were flat. Consumers paid less for food, but slightly more for energy, gasoline and clothing.
New-car prices bounced back from declines a month earlier, when they fell amid a flurry of discounted buying as car buyers flocked to dealerships to take advantage of the government's "cash for clunkers" rebate program. Prices for new automobiles rose 0.4 percent, and used-car prices climbed for a second month.
The so-called core rate of inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, also rose 0.2 percent.
Over all, prices in September were 1.3 percent lower than a year earlier, when gasoline and oil prices plummeted during the financial crisis, dragging down the costs of food, transportation and other costs of living.
Housing costs, which make up a substantial portion of the overall consumer price index, fell 0.3 percent in September, reflecting rising residential vacancies and cheaper hotel rates across the country.
The changes in consumer prices lined up with economists' expectations, and reflected the view of Fed bankers, who believe that excess slack in the economy and its long path toward recovery will keep inflation low.
Minutes from the Fed's latest meeting in September highlighted that view: "Most participants anticipated that slack in both labor and product markets would be substantial over the next few years, leading to subdued and potentially declining wage and price inflation."
In another report on Friday, the Labor Department said that first-time claims for jobless benefits fell to a seasonally adjusted 514,000, from an upwardly revised 524,000 the previous week. The fifth decline in six weeks was below forecasts of 525,000, according to Thomson Reuters.
The four-week average, which smoothes fluctuations, fell for a sixth week to 531,500.

Weak Dollar? Not So Much In China

Abstract: In a statement earlier this month, finance ministers from the Group of 7 did have something to say about China: "We welcome China's continued commitment to a more flexible exchange rate, which should lead to continued appreciation of the renminbi in effective terms and help promote more balanced growth in China and in the world economy." "To rant and rave about the unsustainability of our fiscal policy when they have their own unsustainable monetary policy is a classic case of the pot calling the kettle black," said Robert Barbera, the chief economist of ITG.

Full text: There is renewed talk about the weak dollar. But don't believe it.
Where it really counts, the dollar is not moving at all.
In February, the dollar hit a high against most currencies amid fears of worldwide recession and a desire for the safety of American investments. It was then worth 80 euro cents, and 6.82 Chinese renminbi.
This week, as the dollar neared 67 euro cents, it was still worth 6.82 renminbi.
If you are good in arithmetic, you will immediately realize that the euro has been rising against the Chinese currency. And so has the Japanese yen, the British pound and most every other currency you have heard of.
The strongest and most resilient economy in the worldwide recession has one of the weakest currencies.
In a normal world, that would be a puzzler. As it is, it is simply a problem that governments prefer to ignore.
To be sure, there are some currencies that have been significantly weaker than the Chinese renminbi since February. Searching Bloomberg's database, I found seven: the Argentine peso, the Icelandic krona, the Costa Rican colon, the Pakistani rupee, the Nigerian naira, the Vietnamese dong and the Iranian rial.
That is not a list of countries whose economies anyone would be eager to emulate.
The reason for this is simple, and obvious. China pegs its currency to the United States dollar.
You may remember that peg was very controversial a few years ago. After much griping from the United States and Europe, in 2005 China decided to allow its currency to gradually appreciate against the dollar. But that policy was reversed in the summer of 2008, and since then the Chinese currency has been flat against the dollar.
China talked at the time of using a basket of currencies, rather than the dollar, and letting its currency appreciate against the basket. But the result this year has made it clear that there is no basket, unless perhaps it is made up of the naira, the dong and the rial.
There has been some carping about China's foreign currency policy in Europe, with Jean-Claude Trichet, the president of the European Central Bank, talking about the need for some currencies in emerging markets to appreciate.
But most Western officials would rather talk about something else.
In a statement earlier this month, finance ministers from the Group of 7 did have something to say about China: "We welcome China's continued commitment to a more flexible exchange rate, which should lead to continued appreciation of the renminbi in effective terms and help promote more balanced growth in China and in the world economy."
That statement came about 15 months after China halted "the continued appreciation of the renminbi," a fact the ministers chose not to mention.
Currency diplomacy has never been an area where frank speaking was deemed admirable. Back in the days of fixed exchange rates, when countries were sometimes forced by crises to make abrupt changes, there was even a saying: "He lied like a finance minister on the eve of devaluation."
This year, Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner was widely viewed as having committed a diplomatic faux pas during his confirmation process when he said President Obama believed China was manipulating its currency. The Treasury has since managed to avoid concluding that was happening.
For its part, China has been critical of the United States for its fiscal and trade imbalances, without mentioning that those imbalances have been exacerbated by China's own policies.
"To rant and rave about the unsustainability of our fiscal policy when they have their own unsustainable monetary policy is a classic case of the pot calling the kettle black," said Robert Barbera, the chief economist of ITG.
"I still think," he added, "that the single most destabilizing decision of the last 10 years was the Chinese peg."
That peg forced China to take in huge quantities of dollars and then invest them in dollar-denominated securities, principally Treasuries. That in turn helped to hold down American interest rates and stimulate the housing boom that has since collapsed.
These days it seems to be in the short-term interests of both countries for China to pursue its current policy. The Americans desperately want someone to buy all the Treasuries that are being issued to finance the stimulus program and bank bailouts, and China wants to do whatever it can to stimulate its own economy.
As David Barboza reported in The New York Times this week, some Chinese exporters have been reducing pay to hold down prices and continue making sales to the United States. A stronger currency would make such sales even more difficult to make.
Such considerations have led some to argue that China's peg is a stabilizing force in the world economy. But that makes no sense, at least in the long run. "Something that is inherently unsustainable can't be a force for stability," said Jon Faust, an economic professor at Johns Hopkins University.
It is hard to see how China will do well with all those low-yielding Treasury investments, simply because it is difficult to imagine that, someday, the renminbi will not rise against the dollar. Unless, that is, China's own monetary policies unleash a wave of inflation in that country that reduces the international value of the currency.
But while China pursues its peg, the world's largest exporter will keep exporting and taking in cash rather than imports. The values of the major international currencies will fluctuate against each other, but the inherently stabilizing impact of changing currency values will be limited.
One lesson of the credit boom in the United States was that things that are unsustainable will eventually stop, perhaps abruptly and in highly disruptive ways. The same may yet be said of China's peg.

Full text: President Obama urged Congress on Wednesday to authorize a second $250 stimulus check to be sent early next year to an estimated 57 million Social Security recipients, veterans and people with disabilities.
In effect, the payment would be in lieu of a cost-of-living increase for Social Security beneficiaries next year. The White House request, and receptive statements from Congressional Democratic leaders, anticipated an announcement on Thursday from the Social Security Administration that there would be no cost-of-living adjustment for 2010 because the inflation rate has been negative as the recession has driven down prices.
By contrast, a year ago the cost of living adjustment was 5.8 percent, reflecting strong inflation and high energy prices.
White House officials put the cost of the checks at $13 billion. The first $250 checks went out in May as part of the $787 billion two-year stimulus package. As with that package, the officials said Mr. Obama would not ask Congress to offset the cost with other savings because the checks were intended to stimulate the economy, and budget cuts or tax increases would defeat that.
The money would go to all Social Security beneficiaries, regardless of their income, as well as disabled veterans, those eligible for railroad retirement payments and people who receive federal and state government pensions instead of Social Security.
Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody'sEconomy.com, said the checks would not add a lot to economic growth early next year. But, he added, "This is symbolic of policy makers' willingness to provide more temporary help to the economy, which I believe is appropriate."
Support for the additional payments is certain to be bipartisan, given the political influence of older Americans, but Republicans will almost certainly seize the opportunity to draw attention to persistent economic woes.
"This regrettably shows that families and seniors continue to struggle in this severe economic downturn, and that the 'stimulus' has failed to live up to its billing," said Antonia Ferrier, a spokeswoman for John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio and the House minority leader.

Abstract: Indian stocks are less than 20 percent shy of their 2008 peak, even though corporate profits and the economy as a whole are growing more slowly now. "Because we are a fairly large attractor of capital, the possibilities of bubbles building up in sectors like real estate are very real," said Abheek Barua, chief economist at HDFC Bank, who is nonetheless upbeat about the economy.

Full text: Six months ago, it looked as if India was in for a bumpy recession. Factories were laying off workers and construction sites were grinding to a halt as foreign investment slowed to a trickle.
But in the last few months India has hit a gusher, as investors around the world have turned away from the dollar, the global refuge during the crisis, and rediscovered their optimism in the world economy and India's place in it.
There is palpable optimism here. Major stock indexes have roughly doubled from their March lows. Companies are advertising initial public offerings on television. And articles about bonuses and corporate expansion plans have started replacing news about layoffs and deferred projects on the front pages of newspapers.
Nearly $7 billion more foreign direct investment flowed into India than left the country in the second quarter, from April through June, nearly twice as much as in the previous six months combined.
Including cash invested in the stock and bond markets, India received about $15 billion in foreign investment, the most it has received in any quarter except the last three months of 2007, according to Macquarie Securities.
If the current surge continues -- and skeptics doubt that it can -- the Indian economy could start growing at 8 to 9 percent a year as early as 2010, far sooner than forecasts by the International Monetary Fund and many independent analysts.
"Clearly after the big shock of last year, things are back on track," said Surjit S. Bhalla, who runs Oxus Research and Investments, based in New Delhi. "People are seeing the recovery to be lot more robust than what many of the naysayers are saying."
While many say the good times are here to stay, some analysts worry that the renewed ebullience will be fleeting if global financial markets take another turn down.
Confidence in India's potential could also falter if the government does not address some long-standing problems, namely, improved infrastructure, investment in education and economic reforms, as it has promised to do to lift hundreds of millions out of poverty.
Another big concern is that the foreign money might re-inflate bubbles in stock and real estate markets. Indian stocks are less than 20 percent shy of their 2008 peak, even though corporate profits and the economy as a whole are growing more slowly now.
"Because we are a fairly large attractor of capital, the possibilities of bubbles building up in sectors like real estate are very real," said Abheek Barua, chief economist at HDFC Bank, who is nonetheless upbeat about the economy. "It has clearly happened in China and there is some of that sort of problem here, as well."
For a country that quarantined its economy from the rest of the world for much of the last 60 years, India has increasingly relied on foreign investment in recent years. It has helped bridge the gap between domestic savings and the growing capital needs of the private sector and the government, which is borrowing money to pay for welfare programs and subsidies.
In India's last fiscal year, which ended in March, growth slowed to 6.7 percent, from 9 percent a year earlier, in part because of lower foreign cash flows. Most analysts estimate the economy will grow more than 6 percent this year, but some, like Mr. Bhalla, say growth will be as high as 8 percent.
Rising foreign investment should help offset some of the economic effect of erratic monsoon rains. The agricultural sector makes up about 17 percent of India's economy but sustains more than half its population.
India's economy lacks some of the handicaps present in other countries. For instance, domestic demand never collapsed to the extent it did in the United States, and yet consumer spending is picking up now. Car sales were up 13 percent in the five months that ended in August, compared with the same period last year. Builders say sales of affordable apartments -- priced from $10,000 to $30,000 -- are up, too. Even retailers, who were forced to close hundreds of stores last year after overexpanding, are talking about opening new outlets.
Some Western companies are eager to get a piece of this market. Last month, Ford Motor said it would build and sell a new hatchback here. McDonald's announced that it would open 120 more restaurants. And Baltimore-based T. Rowe Price, according to local news reports, is in talks to buy a stake in an Indian mutual fund firm. T. Rowe Price declined to comment.
At the same time, thanks to strong overseas demand for Indian stocks and bonds, companies here are raising billions of dollars. In a recent initial public offering for Oil India, a government-owned company, demand outstripped available shares by 31 times.
"There is a large amount of liquidity in the world," said A. Murugappan, executive director at Icici Securities. The money is flowing here, because "people see that India and China are the two growth areas."
Still, the rising flow of foreign funds poses challenges.
India's currency has appreciated 11 percent since early March, to 46.13 rupees to the dollar, because of rising demand for rupees and the broad decline in the dollar. That will make Indian garment and jewelry exports less competitive on the world market at a time when those industries are still recovering.
"That is a cause of worry," Vasant Mehta, chairman of India's Gem and Jewelry Export Promotion Council, said about the appreciating rupee. "Profit margins are being squeezed, and in such a period we cannot expect to raise prices."
The governor of the Reserve Bank of India recently said that to control inflation, his central bank might have to raise interest rates before developed countries, where rates are at historic lows. But he said that doing so could encourage overseas investors to move even more money into India, driving the rupee even higher.
And that could be too much of a good thing.

The Lobbyists in the Health Care Fray

Full text: To the Editor:
I am decidedly disgusted with Congress's captivity by lobbying interests in the health care debate ("Lobbyists Fight Efforts to Save on Health Care," front page, Oct. 11). So much so, I wonder just who our nation's leadership is responding to as it continues to drag its feet on meaningful reform.
A year ago, just before the national elections, some 96 percent of Americans viewed health care reform as a top priority for the next president. President Obama was voted in with a mandate for change, and a year later, nothing on health care reform has taken on real traction, and the odds that meaningful reform will pass this legislative session appear to be declining each passing day.
So, if the president has a clear mandate from voters, and his party controls both houses of Congress, what is the reason for the holdup?
Simply, it seems to be lobbyists. Lobbyists for big business, lobbyists for big labor, lobbyists for big hospitals and drug companies and health professionals, among others.
In a late-summer poll by Survey USA, 77 percent of Americans supported a public health care option. Is anybody in Washington listening?
Who is speaking for the people against these wealthy and entrenched interests? Their fear-mongering and selfish blocking of health care reform will, if successful, lead to continued health-cost inflation, ultimately crippling all aspects of the economy. Robert M. Gordon

To the Editor:
Your article about lobbyists is disheartening, but not surprising. It is a given that we cannot eliminate money from politics, so perhaps we should settle for leveling the playing field a little.
I propose a tax on all fees paid to lobbyists and on all amounts lobbyists expend to lobby Congress. The money raised would go to finance a new, strictly nonpartisan Citizens' Lobby, which would perform its own research to determine the best policies to benefit the public interest. It would be allowed access to Congress equal to that accorded to corporate and moneyed interests.
Otherwise, we, the citizens of the United States, have no ability to ensure that our interests are taken into consideration. The power of our individual votes pales in comparison to the flood of dollars for campaigns and lobbyists.

To the Editor:
It is extremely disappointing to see health care legislation succumb to the lobbyists and profit-seekers. Never has the dark side of the legislative process been so apparent and so contrary to the best interests of the average citizen.
Instead of a simple, straightforward solution to the problem of health insurance in this country, Congress is offering a complicated set of proposals that attempt to placate all the self-interest groups in Washington. The result is bloated legislation that does not even achieve the fundamental goal of universal coverage, much less a reduction in health care costs.
Our politicians are apparently incapable of resolving the issue of health care coverage without shortchanging the American people. The best solution is to let the people themselves decide the issue by enacting a voluntary public option available to everyone. It should be a simple and progressive insurance program based on a person's income. Individuals can take it or leave it.
The people, rather than the politicians, can then decide the issue of public versus private insurance. Ron Sheppe

To the Editor:
Re "The Baucus Bill" (editorial, Oct. 11):
In analyzing the Baucus bill, you mention that none of the proposals include any solution to "the relentless and rapid rise of medical spending" for what you consider a "very good reason: Nobody really knows what reforms would work."
But I can suggest at least these four:

End our perverse "fee for service" method of reimbursement to providers.

End or substantially weaken near monopolies in many states by insurance behemoths like Blue Cross.

Introduce a solid public option to keep insurance companies honest and give consumers a meaningful choice.

Allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices, just as Veterans Affairs does.
This is not rocket science.

To the Editor:
The problem with our system is that everyone -- doctors, hospitals, insurers, lawyers, drug companies and so on -- has "a dog in the hunt." It seems that we select which group we favor based on how quickly it makes a deal, how many campaign contributions it makes or public sentiment at a given moment.
As we are often reminded, sausage making is not pretty, but the result of the current negotiations is bound to make for an even worse solution.
If any issue calls for a clean sheet of paper, it is health care. We need to reduce the amount we spend in each of these sectors, perhaps eliminate a sector or two from the process and develop a system that the American people can live with. The answers are intellectually easy, but politically difficult.
Reform that favors select factions is not reform; rather, it is reshuffling the deck. Steve Swanson

Full text: A proposed tax on high-cost, or "Cadillac," health insurance plans has touched off a fierce clash between the Senate and the House as they wrestle over how to pay for legislation that would provide health benefits to millions of uninsured Americans.
Supporters, including many senators, say that the tax is essential to tamping down medical spending and that over 10 years it would generate more than $200 billion, nearly a fourth of what is needed to pay for the legislation.
Critics, including House members and labor unions, say the tax would quickly spiral out of control and hit middle-class workers, people more closely associated with minivans than Cadillacs.
The tax, a provision of the bill to be voted on Tuesday by the Senate Finance Committee, is one of the few remaining proposals under consideration by Congress that budget experts say could lead directly to a reduction in health care spending over the long term, by prompting employers and employees to buy cheaper insurance. Whether it remains in the bill is emerging as a test of the commitment by President Obama and his party to slowing the steep rise of medical expenses.
It is also a prime example of the major differences still to be bridged by Democrats as health care legislation advances to floor debate in both houses.
Under the Finance Committee bill, the tax would be imposed beginning in 2013 on employer- sponsored health plans with total premiums exceeding $8,000 for individuals and $21,000 for families, regardless of whether the coverage was paid for by the employer, the individual or both. The tax would be paid by insurers, who would be expected to pass along the cost to customers.
Critics say that would mean an increase in premiums or in out-of-pocket expenses for employees, raising medical costs for individuals and families.
Supporters say the more likely prospect is that employers would bargain-hunt or take other steps to avoid the tax, putting pressure on insurers to offer cheaper coverage and slowing the rise in medical costs for everyone.
In a preliminary estimate, the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation calculated that absent any such employer efforts, 14 percent of family health policies and 19 percent of individual policies would be hit by the tax in 2013. By 2019, according to the estimate, 37 percent of family policies and 41 percent of individual policies would be affected. Those numbers rise over time in these calculations because although the initial tax threshold would increase with the economy's overall inflation, premiums would be expected to rise even faster.
Many Democratic senators, led by the Finance Committee chairman, Max Baucus of Montana, like the idea of the tax, and Mr. Obama embraced it in his speech to Congress on Sept. 9.
"This reform will charge insurance companies a fee for their most expensive policies, which will encourage them to provide greater value for the money," the president said then. "This modest change could help hold down the cost of health care for all of us in the long run."
Congress has also heard from many economists, Republicans and Democrats alike, who support the tax.
But House Democrats, led by Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York, the chamber's chief tax-writer, oppose the idea, as do labor unions and businesses. Ms. Pelosi last week floated the idea of taxing insurers' "windfall profits" as a possible alternative, to supplement the House's main revenue raiser, an income tax surcharge on the nation's highest earners.
At least 173 House Democrats, two-thirds of the party caucus, have signed a letter to Ms. Pelosi voicing opposition to the insurance tax .
"The tax, supposedly aimed at Cadillac health plans, would affect millions of middle-class people," said Representative Joe Courtney, Democrat of Connecticut. "The American people soundly rejected the idea when it was proposed by Republicans in elections last year."
Under current law, employer-paid premiums for health insurance are not taxable. Experts say this provides a big government subsidy for such coverage, and an incentive for businesses to provide better benefits in lieu of higher wages.
In an unusual alliance reflecting the shared interest of some unions and businesses on the issue, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and the United States Chamber of Commerce are mobilizing opposition to the tax.
James P. Gelfand, senior manager of health policy at the Chamber of Commerce, said that if the tax is imposed, "employers will have to reduce wages or benefits or increase cost-sharing." And, he said, "employees will blame employers, not the government."
Leaders of organized labor, which in recent years has often negotiated for benefits in place of raises, descended on Capitol Hill last week to lobby against the tax, which could hit many health plans covering unionized workers. Larry Cohen, president of the Communications Workers of America, said at least half his members would be in health plans subject to the tax in 2013.
John P. Yrchik, executive director of the Connecticut Education Association, has lobbied Mr. Courtney and other members of the state's Congressional delegation, noting that the tax would affect teachers in 30 percent of Connecticut towns. In some towns, Mr. Yrchik said, health insurance premiums for teachers' family policies already exceed $25,000.
Aides to Mr. Baucus, the Finance Committee chairman, said the tax had numerous benefits, and predicted that employers and employees would shop for health plans to avoid it, forcing insurers to rein in costs.
They also cited projections by the Joint Committee on Taxation that about $142 billion of the 10-year total of $201 billion to be raised by the proposal would come from increased income and payroll taxes -- evidence, they said, that workers would receive increased wages if employers spent less on health benefits.
But the same expectation that employers would adjust their health plans to avoid the tax was cited by some critics as a potential harm for workers.
"Employers and insurers will reduce their benefits to avoid paying the proposed tax," said Representative Pete Stark, the California Democrat who heads the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health. "As a result, middle-class families will be forced to pay more for health care."
Some experts said that the tax was a complicated, backdoor way to tax employer-provided health benefits, and a number of them maintained that simply ending the tax exemption for such benefits would be a better approach.
Others said the tax would have an uneven impact, falling harder on businesses that, for instance, have older employees or are situated in high-cost regions.
Robert H. Dobson, an actuary at Milliman, an employee benefits consulting firm, said, "The high cost of so-called Cadillac plans has as much to do with the characteristics of the covered population as it does with the richness of the benefits."

Full text: The Senate Finance Committee may finally be ready to vote on its version of a health care reform bill. For months, its chairman, Max Baucus, and other members have struggled to produce legislation that could win significant Republican support. Fat chance. Only one Republican on the committee seems open to voting for the bill, and the entire Republican Congressional leadership seems determined -- for ideological and partisan reasons -- to torpedo the entire reform effort.
Still, all the months of wrangling have not gone for naught. The bill has farsighted elements that ought to be included in any final legislation -- and serious defects that ought to be remedied. It would do more to contain costs and restrain future deficits than any other bill under consideration, and it is far better than allowing costs to continue escalating on their current disastrous path.
Unfortunately, the bill would leave 17 million citizens and legal residents without insurance in 2019. That is better than allowing current trends to continue but nowhere near enough.
With so much attention focused on the Finance Committee, it has been easy to forget that there are actually five separate bills in Congress. Many commentators have treated the Senate Finance bill as the likely template for any final legislation because it may be more palatable to conservative Democrats, and deficit hawks, in both houses.
But the Finance Committee's bill should be viewed as the least that Congress should do -- a foundation upon which to build, not the final structure.
Here are some of the details to consider as the debate proceeds:
COMMON ELEMENTS All of the bills would require the vast majority of Americans to have health insurance or pay a penalty. Insurers would be prohibited from denying coverage or charging higher premiums for patients in poor health. The bills would create new insurance exchanges on which people who buy their own insurance or work for small companies could buy coverage at large group rates. The bills would also provide tax subsidies to help low- and middle-income Americans buy insurance, and expand Medicaid to cover more poor Americans.
These provisions would provide more security for all Americans. They would provide the greatest benefit to the millions who lack insurance or must buy it directly from insurers, often at very high prices.
COSTS AND DEFICITSPresident Obama and his budget director have insisted that health care reforms must be deficit neutral over the next decade and deficit-reducing over the longer term. Those are reasonable goals, and the Finance Committee seems to have met the president's specifications, and then some.
The bill received an important boost last week when the Congressional Budget Office estimated that it would cost $829 billion over the next 10 years -- well under the $900 billion President Obama had suggested -- and would reduce the deficit by $81 billion over that period.
Revenue from proposed new taxes and savings from slowing the growth of Medicare costs would more than make up for the cost of covering some 29 million uninsured people.
The deficit reduction would be even greater in the following decade because revenues and savings are projected to grow at an annual rate of 10 to 15 percent, while the cost of the subsidies and Medicaid expansions is projected to grow at a rate of only 8 percent.
Unfortunately, it appears that one of the key ways the committee keeps deficits down is by limiting subsidies and settling for far less than universal coverage. The House bills do better.
We are far more impressed with its proposal to raise revenues and achieve savings almost entirely within the health care system -- by imposing fees on health care providers and by taxing high-priced policies that encourage overuse of medical services. Such revenues rise as fast or faster than medical inflation.
By contrast, the House bills would impose an income tax surcharge on the wealthiest Americans, and the Obama administration suggested curtailing tax deductions for the wealthy, two sources of revenue that grow more slowly than medical inflation.
We have recommended taxing the wealthy, who benefited enormously from the Bush-era tax cuts. But Congress might well consider adding taxes within the health care system, including taxes on the most expensive insurance plans.
The Finance Committee's stellar performance in deficit reduction also relies in part on perpetuating a long-standing Congressional accounting gimmick: It boosts Medicare reimbursements to doctors for one year and then pretends that sharp reductions will occur over the next decade. (Every year Congress votes to up the payments.) The bills pending in the House would offer a permanent fix to the reimbursement problem, but at a cost exceeding $200 billion over the next decade. Sooner or later Congress ought to solve this problem, if not in the reform bills then in separate legislation fully paid for.
COVERAGE The Senate Finance bill would still leave 17 million citizens and legal residents without coverage in 2019. By contrast, the pending House bills would leave only about nine million citizens and legal residents without health insurance.
If Congress can cover millions more of the uninsured by anteing up another $100 billion to $150 billion, it should find the money to do so.
We continue to believe that covering the uninsured is a moral imperative -- and sound economics.
People without insurance tend to delay seeking medical care until their diseases, like diabetes and incipient cancer, become so severe that they require emergency attention and often cannot be treated effectively. The rest of us pay for their charitable care through taxes or higher premiums on private insurance.
Near-universal coverage is also needed to provide a large risk pool in which the premiums from healthy people on the exchanges can help subsidize the premiums of sick people. The Finance Committee softened its own bill to reduce and delay the penalties for noncompliance and exempted an estimated two million people from the mandate. While these people would not be penalized, they would also not be insured. A better solution would be to provide more generous subsidies so that people could afford coverage.
OTHER WEAKNESSES The Finance Committee's bill also lacks a public plan to compete with private insurers, which would provide more choice to consumers, hold down prices and save the government money on subsidies. It also lacks a mandate on employers to offer coverage or pay a penalty, which would both expand coverage and yield additional money for the government. Both are proposed in all the other bills.
MEDICAL REFORMS Critics of the current bills regularly complain that they do little to reform the delivery of health care by hospitals, doctors and other providers, the only lasting solution to slowing the relentless and rapid rise of medical spending.
That is largely true, and for a very good reason: Nobody really knows what reforms would work. All of the pending bills would spend money on various studies, demonstrations and pilot projects in the expectation that some might pan out.
One of the best features of the Senate Finance bill is that it would establish a new commission -- insulated from political lobbying -- to find ways to limit the growth in Medicare spending, and a new center to test innovative payment methods to improve quality and reduce costs in Medicare. That seems the most sensible approach given enormous uncertainties on how to rein in medical costs.
We remain optimistic that -- with sustained attention -- Congress and the executive branch can find ways to reform the delivery of medical care. It may take time. But it would beinhumane to put off covering the uninsured until we have the savings in hand.
Given that the reform effort will have to be at least deficit neutral for the next decade, there is time to experiment.
One must not forget that doing nothing -- the Republicans have yet to make any serious counterproposals -- virtually ensures that the cost of insurance and of medical care will continue to soar. That will place even more financial strain on policyholders and employers. And it will saddle the country, and all of us, with ever larger deficits.

Full text: THE sudden rise in home prices suggests that the psychology of the market has shifted substantially. But what should we expect in the months ahead? Not necessarily that we're entering a new housing boom. To a large extent, where we're heading depends on what home buyers are thinking.
Some clues are found in the annual home-buyer surveys that Karl Case, the Wellesley economics professor, and I have run for years. For the surveys, we canvas recent home buyers in four cities -- Los Angeles, San Francisco, Milwaukee and Boston; the surveys are now being conducted under the auspices of the Yale School of Management. We have just received the 2009 results, with responses from June and July.
This year's survey coincides nicely with the upturn in home prices, the sharpest change in direction we have ever seen. The data show that the Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller 10-City Composite Home Price Index for the United States rose 3.6 percent between April and July. While that is not a whopping increase, it followed a decline of 4.8 percent in the previous period, between January and April.
The suddenness of this shift surprised me. In my column in June, I wrote that home prices might well continue to decline for years. As of that time, the S.& P./Case-Shiller price index had fallen every month for almost three years. Add to that the prospect of continuing high unemployment and a weak economy for years to come, and the prospects for home prices did not seem rosy.
But the new data are startling. Since the indexes began in 1987, the closest parallel to such a change came at the conclusion of the last housing bust, at the end of the 1990-91 recession. Home prices rose 2.3 percent from April to July 1991 after having fallen 2.1 percent from January to April that year. By July 1996, five years after that "turnaround," home prices were down 0.6 percent from their July 1991 level, and down 13.8 percent in inflation-adjusted terms.
Could the more extreme recent shift mean that home prices will just keep rising this time? Here is where our new survey results are helpful.
We looked at both the long- and short-term attitudes of home buyers. In our survey, we ask, "On average over the next 10 years, how much do you expect the value of your property to change each year?" The average answer among 311 respondents in 2009 was an increase of 11.2 percent. The median response -- with half above, half below -- was 5 percent, also high. That sounds rather like bubble thinking.
For a home buyer who borrows 90 percent of the money to acquire a house, an appreciation rate of 11.2 percent offers an investment bonanza. By putting a small amount of money down, investors stand to make a large gain if home prices climb. That is the power of leveraging. Recently, however, home buyers have also experienced the unpleasant consequences of leverage when home prices fall. Investing in a home during the wild past few years has been like gambling in a casino: You can leave with riches or empty pockets.
In our survey data from one year earlier, when prices were falling at an annual rate of nearly 20 percent, buyers were still expressing long-term optimism. Then, the average answer to the question about expected yearly increases in home values was 9.5 percent a year, with a median of 5 percent -- high figures indeed for that time. The bubble thinking is not new.
Those long-term expectations may not have changed much in character, but short-term expectations certainly have. In the survey, we also ask, "How much of a change do you expect there to be in the value of your home over the next 12 months?" Here, the average answer for June-July 2009 was a 2.3 percent rise, versus a negative 0.4 percent a year earlier. That was a dramatic change.
Another survey question is this: "If you think that present trends will not continue forever, what do you think will stop them?" Respondents were asked to answer in their own words. In 2008, when the current trend was unambiguously down, people nonetheless made it clear that they thought a housing recovery would come as the recession ended, with a new president after the election, and after home prices have come back down. What has changed in 2009 is that they suddenly see this anticipated scenario as actually playing out.
An additional question pertains to short-run considerations of market timing. We have been asking respondents whether they agree with this statement: "I bought now because I felt that I had to even though I might have done better financially if I had waited." During the housing boom in 2004, only 17.9 percent agreed with that statement. That figure doubled, to 36.7 percent, when prices were dropping fast in 2008, and now has come back to 24.8 percent.
WHAT should we conclude? Given the abnormality of the economic environment, the sudden turn in the housing market probably reflects a new home-buyer emphasis on market timing. For years, people have been bulls for the long term. The change has been in their short-term thinking. The latest answers suggest that people think the price slide is over, so there is no longer such a good reason to wait to buy. And so they cause an upward blip in prices.
At the moment, it appears that the extreme ups and downs of the housing market have turned many Americans into housing speculators. Many people are still playing a leverage game, watching various economic indicators as well as the state of federal bailout programs -- including the $8,000 first-time home-buyer tax credit that is currently scheduled to expire before Dec. 1 -- in an effort to time their home-buying decisions. The sudden turn could signal a new housing boom, but is more likely just a sign of a period of higher short-run price volatility.

Full text: To the Editor:
Regarding the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to President Obama on Friday (The New York Times on the Web, Oct. 9):
I applaud this stunning decision as a much-needed boost to the image of the United States on the world stage and as a vote of confidence in President Obama's diplomatic efforts.
But conservatives in this country are going to see it as an effort by the Nobel Committee to unduly influence President Obama's policy review on Afghanistan. Meanwhile, progressives will find succor in what Rahm Emanuel jokingly referred to as an "Oslo beats Copenhagen" moment.
Nonetheless, congratulations, Mr. President! This award could not have come at a better time for you and America.

I love Barack Obama, I voted for him, I approve of his policy initiatives and his leadership. But the Nobel Peace Prize? Isn't it a bit premature?
George Wolf
New York, Oct. 9, 2009

To the Editor:
While the Nobel Peace Prize is a tribute to the mood that President Obama has created around much of the world and what he will do, it is also a strong statement by the Nobel Committee in Oslo against the American presidency of the last eight years.
Once again many of us here in the United States feel that anything is possible, that everyone has the same chances. Alas, this was not the case during the last administration. Congratulations to President Obama, who has proven once again that "yes, we can."
Jennifer Dorn
New York, Oct. 9, 2009

To the Editor:
Notwithstanding my respect and admiration for Barack Obama's record, this award seems wrong in too many ways. As many have said, it looks premature. But let me stress other drawbacks:

It does not seem innocent. As has often been the case with Nobel awards, this one seems geared toward influencing policy (in this case, preventing Mr. Obama from sending additional troops to Afghanistan), rather than recognizing achievements.

It misstates Mr. Obama's most obvious accomplishments. If the Nobel Committee admires the president for starting a new era of postracial, multicultural, tolerant politics in America and the world (which is worthy enough for the prize), it should have said so explicitly.

It eliminates the incentive for Mr. Obama to win the prize in the future. Most world leaders dream of winning the Nobel Peace Prize one day. Holding off on giving him the prize would have given Mr. Obama one more incentive to foster world peace in the years to come.
The Nobel Foundation would be protecting its credibility by increasing its transparency and reducing its activism.

To the Editor:
It is irresponsible and dangerous to award the Nobel Peace Prize to a sitting commander in chief currently overseeing two wars of aggression. The Nobel Committee made vague assertions about President Obama's diplomatic efforts and lofty vision for a nuclear-free world.
But the truth is that Mr. Obama is not the first president to call for nuclear disarmament, nor is he ready to set the example by destroying our enormous nuclear arsenal.
It is deeply troubling that Mr. Obama was awarded the Nobel Prize not for what he has achieved, but for what he has said he hopes to achieve.
Sam Maron
Burlington, Vt., Oct. 9, 2009

To the Editor:
While I congratulate President Obama on his Nobel Prize, I fear that this award will only add to conservatives' outrage and malicious characterization of the president. When he ran for office, without a Nobel Prize, he was mocked as "the anointed one."
I suspect that his receipt of an award, granted by a Norwegian committee, will encourage those critics who claim that Mr. Obama is somehow un-American or that he signals a nefarious Europeanization of American politics.
James Monk
Houston, Oct. 9, 2009

To the Editor:
Have we returned to George Orwell's "1984"? Does "peace" mean "war"?
I believe that President Obama is the first recipient of the Peace Prize to be waging two wars at the very moment of the announcement of the award.
I voted for Mr. Obama, but the Nobel Committee has in one stroke devalued the moral currency of the prize. I hope that some of the previous laureates who were true seekers of, and workers for, peace will say so -- women and men like, to name a few, Bishop Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo and President Jose Ramos-Horta of East Timor, Nelson Mandela of South Africa, Mairead Corrigan and Betty Williams of Northern Ireland, Rigoberta Menchu of Guatemala and Daw Aung San Suu Kyi of Myanmar.

To the Editor:
Regarding the Nobel Peace Prize and comments that President Obama hasn't accomplished much yet, I beg to differ. Mr. Obama has people across the world thinking in new and different ways, enabling them to go forth and make their own contribution to making the planet a better place. What greater accomplishment could there be for world peace than that?
Susan K. Whoriskey
Belmont, Mass., Oct. 9, 2009

To the Editor:
When I awoke to the surprising and welcome news that President Obama had won the Nobel Peace Prize, I could already hear the howls from the Republican Party diminishing the honor and attacking the Nobel Committee. Sure enough, right on cue, the Republican chairman, Michael Steele, pooh-poohed the president's "star power" and wished out loud that someone else had taken the award.
Here's a helpful note to the Republican Party: it is good news for America when its sitting president wins the Nobel Peace Prize. Just take this one with some grace, please.
Cody Harris
San Francisco, Oct. 9, 2009

To the Editor:
I'm a college teacher who voted for President Obama, but I know grade inflation when I see it.
The president could demonstrate real mettle by telling the Nobel Committee: "Thanks for the thought, guys, but I know I haven't accomplished anything yet. I hope you can keep me in mind a few years down the road, though."

Full text: Investors clamored to buy pretty much anything on Tuesday -- as long as it was not the dollar.
A seven-month slide in the value of the dollar gained force as investors migrated to other markets and fretted over a report that crude oil could one day be priced in other currencies, hobbling the dollar's role as a vehicle for global trade.
On Wall Street, shares climbed on hopes of robust profit reports as earnings season unofficially begins this week. And the dollar's decline propelled gold prices to record highs above $1,040 an ounce and touched off a buying spree for copper, silver, platinum and crude oil -- commodities that typically hold their value if the dollar does not.
"Right now it doesn't give any sign of pulling back significantly," said James Steel, a commodities analyst at HSBC. "There's still a worry about the dollar. There's a latent worry about inflation."
The dollar slipped further against major currencies, continuing a decline that has sent it tumbling 15 percent since early March. The dollar fell to $1.47 against the euro, and the Japanese yen strengthened to 88.83 for every dollar.
Investors who sought the relative safety of the American currency during the financial crisis are now pursuing higher returns in stocks, commodities and foreign currencies, out of concern that demand for American debt is waning, and that the dollar could someday lose its status as the world's reserve currency.
Underlying the dollar's weakness is the growing perception that many policy makers around the world, and in Washington, may welcome a slow but sustained depreciation of the dollar, especially against the Chinese renminbi and other Asian currencies.
A weaker dollar would make imported goods more expensive in the United States and American exports more competitive, but it could make overseas investors wary of buying the Treasury bonds that the country needs to sell to finance its deficit.
The slide gained momentum after the Reserve Bank of Australia surprised investors Tuesday by raising interest rates, making Australia the first big economy to lift rates after the global financial crisis.
Countries around the world -- including the United States -- trimmed interest rates to record lows as the credit crisis metastasized last year, in an emergency effort to stimulate the markets and keep lending from drying up. Although credit is flowing better now, the Federal Reserve has indicated that interest rates will hover near zero for some time.
"The move was taken as a sign that the global economy is firmly on the road to recovery," said Vassili Serebriakov, a currency strategist at Wells Fargo. "That's lifted risk appetites and assets across the world. The dollar strengthened when global financial markets went into a tailspin and has retraced back all that strength."
Adding to the turmoil, a report on Tuesday in The Independent, a British newspaper, suggested that China, France, Japan and Russia were in secret talks with Persian Gulf countries to abandon the dollar for international trade in oil and replace it with a basket of currencies and gold.
The article named no sources and was quickly denied by Muhammad al-Jasser, the governor of the Saudi central bank, and Dmitry Pankin, Russia's deputy finance minister. French officials declined to comment. In China, the government is closed for a weeklong holiday, but well-connected bankers were skeptical.
"While informal discussions might have taken place, I doubt they represent a serious intent to undermine the existing global monetary order or the role of the U.S. dollar," said Fred Hu, who is the chairman of greater China for Goldman Sachs and advises the Chinese government.
But the report caught the attention of investors because several economists had been predicting that at some point, the world's oil exporters would start moving toward other currencies to limit exposure to the dollar.
"It won't be easy to make such a shift; it's a pretty unrealistic idea in the near term," said Qu Hongbin, an HSBC economist in Hong Kong. But in the years to come, he added, China would be delighted if it could print its own currency to pay for oil, instead of having to earn dollars through exports.
Any shift away from the dollar for oil trading, or for commodities more broadly, would seriously undermine global demand for dollars and strengthen the alternatives to it. This would make it harder for Washington to borrow overseas to finance its budget and trade deficits, and could fuel inflation in the United States.
Analysts characterized the surge in commodities prices on Tuesday as a reaction to weakness in the dollar, rather than a sign of bullish hopes for a quick recovery. Although activity is picking up, oil consumption remains subdued as factories work at part capacity, and consumers are still reluctant to spend thousands of dollars on gold jewelry when the recovery is tenuous. Crude oil futures in New York rose 43 cents, to $70.83 a barrel, and gold futures rose $21.90, to $1,039.70.
Despite worries about the eclipse of the dollar and an estimated $1.6 trillion deficit in 2009, the United States is still finding many eager buyers in the debt market. Foreign governments have billions of dollars in their coffers, and demand for Treasury notes has risen since May, making it cheaper for the government to finance its own operations.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 131.50 points, or 1.37 percent, to 9,731.25, and the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was 14.26 points, or 1.37 percent, higher at 1,054.72, adding to their sharp gains from a day earlier. The Nasdaq was 1.7 percent, or 35.42 points, higher at 2,103.57.
Interest rates rose. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 10/32, to 103 3/32, and the yield rose to 3.26 percent, from 3.22 percent late Monday.

Full text: Of Interest Rates
And Exit Moves
Australia is sometimes known as the "lucky country." Its success in fiscal and monetary policy, though, has more to do with skill. If other countries had followed the Aussie way in the good times, the financial crisis would have been less bad. But it's not too late to follow a good example.
The Reserve Bank of Australia increased its target for overnight interest rates by 0.25 percentage point on Tuesday, to 3.25 percent. It was the first central bank among the G-20 nations to push rates up since the crisis began. But then Australian interest rates were generally relatively high before the crisis -- the policy rate stayed above 5 percent from 2003 on, peaking at 7.25 percent in 2008.
Australia also followed a conservative fiscal policy, paying off almost all its public debt. That gave it more room for fiscal and monetary stimulus during the downturn. Technically, Australia avoided recession, growing in both the first two quarters of 2009. The global rise in mineral prices has further benefited its economy. It wasn't too hard for the Reserve Bank to decide to tighten.
Other countries don't have Australia's advantages. But the current fashionable policy combination of heavy fiscal stimulus, extraordinary liquidity measures and interest rates below the level of inflation have caused sharp run-ups in global commodity, bond and stock prices. Such policies could eventually prove inflationary.
Other nations' "exit strategies" shouldn't start with a withdrawal of liquidity. The two worst recessions in United States history, those of 1837-43 and 1929-41, were both fueled by liquidity shortages that led to prolonged deflation. If central banks worldwide cut back liquidity now, without increasing rates, they would risk something similarly dismal.
But raising interest rate targets -- without ending other liquidity programs -- presents no such danger. Doing that would reduce the upward price pressure on financial assets. And weaker bond markets would force governments to get serious about budget deficits rather than borrowing more.
With asset bubbles deflating and deficits declining, liquidity could be withdrawn slowly, without starving the private-sector economy of necessary finance. Then the rest of the world would start to look a bit more like that lucky place down under.
Property Deals Return
Real estate deals are back -- to a point. The British retailer Tesco and the European banks HSBC and BBVA have notched almost $3 billion of sale-and-leaseback deals in two weeks. The three are hardly distressed sellers. But a thawing in the commercial property market is giving them a chance to tidy up their balance sheets.
At first glance, HSBC seems to be selling its United States headquarters on Fifth Avenue cheaply to an Israeli conglomerate, IDB. The $330 million price tag puts a juicy 13 percent rental yield on this prime piece of Manhattan real estate in the first year. But IDB's opportunistic move is a risky one. After 12 months, HSBC will vacate a third of the building.
For HSBC, the deal delivers only a modest profit. But it allows the bank to release capital tied up in property and redeploy it in its core operating business. The move is also consistent with HSBC's stated belief that the world faces a double-dip recession. Similar deals may lie in store for its offices in London and Paris.
The Tesco and BBVA deals look richer for them. Tesco is selling $:514 million ($817 million) of property at yields of 5 to 6 percent. For the buyers of 948 BBVA branches, yields will probably be closer to 6 percent, according to a person familiar with the situation. Again, the proceeds can be put to more profitable use in the companies' operating businesses.
While they may not be getting bargains, the buyers in these cases are securing multi-decade leases offering inflation protection. That's an attractive combination when the economic outlook remains uncertain and huge stimulus measures threaten inflation eventually.
Banks and other companies remain under pressure to tidy up their balance sheets. And while the short-term outlook for commercial real estate is far from assured, buyers are returning to the market.
The latest entrant is France's BNP Paribas Real Estate, with a new $:150 million ($238 million) fund meant for deals in Britain. The recent flurry of sale-and-leaseback deals looks set to continue.

Full text: In the last two decades, more than a million families around the country have invested in state funds that pledged to cover the cost of attending their state's public colleges and universities, regardless of how much tuition increased.
But in the last year, the stock market slump and rising college costs have combined to drive all but two of the nation's 18 such funds, known as prepaid college savings plans, into the red, jeopardizing those pledges.
Even with stock market gains since March, the losses have forced some programs, like Pennsylvania's and Washington's, to impose new and higher fees that could amount to thousands of dollars a year in additional costs to parents.
Others, like South Carolina's, have developed doomsday scenarios, capping how much a family would get if the program shut down completely. West Virginia had to pump $8 million into its prepaid program to help restore its financial health because its fund lost 25 percent of its value in the last year. And Alabama closed its program to new enrollees because the fund lost almost half of its assets -- more than $300 million -- in the stock market in the last year, and the state might have to put its own money in to keep it solvent.
"I think ultimately more and more of these plans are going to close down to new investments," said Mark Kantrowitz, the founder and publisher of FinAid.org, a financial aid Web site.
"Every time there's a significant market downturn, there's two main ways states make up for the losses: close to new participants to cut off the losses," Mr. Kantrowitz said, "or raise fees. And raising fees makes it less attractive to new participants."
The funds were first proposed 23 years ago in Michigan as a fail-safe investment tool. They were quickly adopted by other states after 1996, when Congress allowed them to be tax-deferred under Section 529 of the Internal Revenue Code. In 2001, Congress expanded that to make all qualified educational disbursements tax-free. As a result, the 529 prepaid funds -- not to be confused with 529 college savings plans that do not promise a specific return -- grew into financial powerhouses, even though 7 of the 18 funds have closed to new investments over the years.
All 18 state prepaid plans differ slightly, but most sell contracts or tuition credits that establish how much someone will pay in now to receive a certain return in the future based on projected in-state public university tuition.
If, in the end, students decide not to go to a state school, they can use the money at other schools, though the amount is likely to fall short of the full cost of tuition.
Between them, the 18 state funds serve nearly 1.6 million families and hold $23.8 billion in assets, ranging from Tennessee's small $80 million fund serving 9,700 families to Florida's massive $8.7 billion fund that serves about 850,000 families.
"The reason they're popular is simply because the states bear the risk, not the individual," said Jackie Williams, who was executive director of the Ohio Tuition Trust Authority for 10 years, until June.
The trust oversees Ohio's $590 million prepaid fund, which was closed to new enrollees in 2003 after the state began allowing public universities to raise their tuition as high as they wanted. That resulted in double-digit increases, which, combined with a tough stock market, threw the fund out of balance.
Not every state fully guarantees its prepaid funds. Only five states offer a "full faith and credit" of the state guarantee, and seven are required by law to consider helping the funds out if need be. The other five states -- Alabama, Colorado, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Tennessee -- and Texas's new prepaid fund have no guarantee, though officials say they doubt that the states would ever let the funds become insolvent and would step in if need be.
All of the funds but Florida's and Colorado's now have an actuarial deficit, meaning they do not have enough money to pay all of their future college tuition obligations. Most are only about 80 percent to 90 percent funded. But many are worse off, like the Illinois fund, which is about 75 percent funded, and South Carolina and Alabama's funds, which are both about 66 percent funded.
Carol M. Perdue was troubled by a letter she got from Alabama's treasurer this summer that said the state's prepaid program had lost about 50 percent of its assets in the stock market. She is suing to force the state to put money into the fund to make up for the losses.
"At first I was kind of scared," said Ms. Perdue, 40, an insurance agent in Phenix City who has about $30,000 in the program for her two daughters. "And then I felt almost cheated, like I was sold a bill of goods that wasn't there."
Even Florida's program could be in for tough times. The state has stayed out of trouble because it has 90 percent of its assets in fixed income investments, unlike other funds with 50 percent to 70 percent of their assets in the stock market, and it has enjoyed very low tuition increases.
But the Florida Legislature for the first time has allowed public universities to raise tuition by up to 15 percent a year for the next five years, which is much greater than the 6.5 percent average the fund has counted on in the last two decades.
"You can't keep up with 15 percent tuition inflation with fixed income," said Andrew A. Davis, executive director of the Illinois Student Assistance Commission, which oversees that state's prepaid fund. "They'll have to change something."
Despite all this bad news, investors continue to see the funds as an attractive option, particularly in a tough economy, for one simple reason.
"Even with all the problems, no one has ever lost money in the process," said Joseph F. Hurley, founder of Savingforcollege.com, which specializes in dissecting the different 108 college savings and prepaid plans.
Ganesh Seshadri has invested $200,000 in Pennsylvania's fund, which has lost about 25 percent of its value. He is philosophical about the fund's losses, which have not affected his investment, though he has stopped investing in it because of the increased fees and costs imposed recently.
"If I get back the return they promised, it will be a good investment, because all of my other investments tanked," said Mr. Seshadri, 55, a hospital computer analyst in Murrysville, Pa. He has children at Northwestern University and Carnegie Mellon, and one in high school.
Many states, aware of the allure of prepaid funds, are now keeping an eye on Texas, which opened a fund in the last year after closing another one in 2003 to new enrollments. The new fund shifts the burden of the guarantee from the state to the public university system. If the fund runs short, the universities agree to cover the difference between what is available and how much tuition is in the future.
"It's an interesting idea, but the money has to come from somewhere," Mr. Kantrowitz said. "Saying you'll pay anyway is sweeping it under the rug. But it will be interesting to see if it works."
Texans apparently think it will. Since last September, amid the financial meltdown, about 13,000 families invested a total of $95 million in the fund.

Full text: After a disappointing start to October, equity investors can be forgiven for wishing that the third quarter had lasted forever. Stock markets around the world ignored the deep recession from July to September, rising by double-digit percentages almost everywhere except Japan. The MSCI World equity index was up 15 percent.
That was enough to bring an end to the bear market that started in 2007. But the longer bear market for stocks -- the one that began in 2000 -- may not be over yet.
Stock markets have underperformed the economy over the last decade. While retail prices and real G.D.P. have risen at an annual rate of 2 to 3 percent in many countries, most indices are still at levels seen in 1998 or 1999.
Stocks were a bargain when markets bottomed in March, driven down by a combination of fear and squeezed liquidity. Now, though, the case for buying is much less clear.
The global stock market is trading at about 14 times expected 2010 earnings, according to Societe Generale estimates. That is not particularly cheap by long-term standards. And those earnings expectations rely on assumed improvements in profit margins. Unless the recovery takes a sharp V-shape, earnings could disappoint and drag down stocks.
Equity investors taking the long view don't have too much to worry about. Bear markets don't last forever, although they can go on for a long time if Japan is any guide. The recession will not continue indefinitely. As long as deflation is averted, stock prices should be up substantially a decade from now. But that does not mean stocks will rise in a straight line from here.
Holders of government bonds, the apparently safer alternative to stocks, have much more to fear. Yields of about 3.5 percent on 10-year paper leave almost no room for unexpected inflation. But with central banks and governments all pushing hard to get money flowing -- including some interventions that keep bond yields down -- the risk of an inflationary outburst is high.
Investors may not like the notion that stocks aren't great, but bonds look worse. There are grim periods, though, when almost all investments do poorly. Despite a few good months, this may be one of them.
A Sobering Tale
Femsa has turned up late to the beer bash. The Mexican brewer of Dos Equis, Tecate and Sol stayed happily on its own as rivals swapped brews in a global consolidation binge over the last few years. Now it wants to join the party, disclosing last week that it is in talks to offload cerveza from its Coca-Cola bottling and convenience-store operations. But many would-be suitors are nursing hangovers from earlier deals.
The renamed Anheuser-Busch InBev is still digesting the purchase of the Budweiser brewer -- and owns a majority stake in Femsa's larger domestic rival, Modelo. Heineken is already Femsa's partner in Brazil, with 17 percent of the Femsa-controlled Kaiser. But with net debt already at three times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, the Dutch brewer would be hard-pressed to borrow more without breaching loan covenants. And issuing equity could threaten family control.
Meanwhile, Molson Coors is probably too small to make a go of it south of the border with Femsa, leaving SABMiller as one of the few options.
Recent beer targets have been swallowed for an enterprise value of about 12 times adjusted earnings. That multiple would imply Femsa is worth $9 billion or so. But that would amount to a whopping 69 percent premium to the operation's fair value, according to UBS. That makes Femsa's brew seem less than tasty.
After all, Femsa is only No. 2 in Mexico, which itself is not a top-tier market. Low profitability in Brazil is a drag on margins, and its push into the United States has slowed. Tougher competition looms with AB-InBev angling to buy the half of Modelo it doesn't already own. And Mexico's proposed fiscal plan aims to raise taxes on beer.
Four years ago, in happier financial times and before some peers settled on other partners, Femsa's boss, Jose Antonio Fernandez Carbajal, said he was "very content" with the company's position and saw no sense in selling. It may be that with a beer in hand, he got just a little too comfortable.

Full text: Carnaval came four months early to Brazil this year.
Tens of thousands of Rio's samba-loving residents poured out onto Copacabana Beach where they danced into the evening in flip-flops and green-and-yellow bikinis to celebrate their city's selection as the site of the 2016 Olympics.
There was pride and the feeling that something powerful had just happened to the country. The International Olympic Committee's decision to entrust the games to Brazil -- the first in South America -- confirmed this country's arrival onto the world stage with a defining moment that to many here promised even greater prosperity in the decade to come.
"My Brazil is solid," said Celso de Nascimento, an electrical technician, who danced shirtless with his wife in the hot afternoon sun. "We have it all."
Noting that Rio beat out Chicago for the honor, he said, "We aren't the United States, but we are getting there, and we will get there."
The decision was also a seminal achievement for President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, a former auto plant worker with a fourth-grade education who has helped make Brazil the economic and political leader of South America.
"Brazil went from a second-class country to a first-class country, and today we began to receive the respect we deserve," Mr. da Silva said from Copenhagen after the vote on Friday, pulling out a handkerchief several times during the ceremony to dab cheeks wet with tears. "I could die now and it already would have been worth it."
The Olympic glow seemed to reinforce the perception that Mr. da Silva was born under the luckiest of stars. Brazil rode a commodity and consumer-spending boom the past half-decade as the government tamed inflation, expanded the economy and narrowed a wide inequality gap. In just the past two years Brazil has discovered huge troves of deep-sea oil.
With the soccer World Cup coming to Brazil in 2014 -- the final match is to be played at Rio's Maracana Stadium -- the country is set to be a showcase for two of the world's greatest sporting events.
When he was elected in 2002, Mr. da Silva's background as a union leader and a leftist unnerved international financial markets and the Bush administration. But he adopted a pragmatic approach that calmed foreign investors and solidified Brazil's economy. His charisma and popularity, both in and out of his country, helped him eclipse Venezuela's Hugo Chavez as the region's most influential leader.
While Mr. Chavez has been largely shunned by the United States, Mr. da Silva has rubbed shoulders with an admiring President Obama, negotiated military deals with President Nicolas Sarkozy of France and become an important player in global climate discussions. Two weeks ago he was feted in New York at a dinner attended by American Congress members and the chief executive of Exxon.
"The Olympics are a crowning achievement in the efforts that Brazil has made to participate actively in world affairs," said Amaury de Souza, a political analyst in Rio. For Mr. da Silva, the Olympics have been part of an "obsession" with being remembered as a great president, Mr. de Souza said, of Mr. da Silva's overcoming his humble beginnings.
Mr. da Silva, a sports fan, threw himself into the Olympic bid process, traveling to London and Beijing to visit Olympic facilities and meet with committee delegates, and ensuring that Rio's bid had financial guarantees at the federal level. Since 2003, he has increased spending on sports programs in the country to $773 million from $209 million, the Sports Ministry said.
In Denmark on Friday Mr. da Silva's speech in support of the bid seemed to win votes abroad and at home.
"I had hoped that we could win, but after the speech by Lula I had no doubt whatsoever," said Daniel Martins, 46, a lawyer who ambled by on his bicycle to take in the party in Copacabana. "We are so moved, so proud to be Brazilians today, to be Cariocas," he said, using the name for Rio residents.
Still, amid the celebration, the realization began to dawn that the hard work was just beginning. Rio's $11 billion budget for urban infrastructure projects for the Olympics was three times larger than the bid of any other finalist, and its history of overpromising projects for the 2007 Pan-American Games left a bad taste in the mouths of many here.
Organizers will have to build more hotel rooms and complete a ring road to relieve congestion to the airport. A high-speed train from Rio to Sao Paulo is expected to be completed in time for the World Cup.
Some argued that Brazil was not ready to host the Games, and that the money could be better spent relieving poverty and further developing sports programs in a country where most professional athletes earn very little.
"Having an Olympics here now is an insult to Brazil's underprivileged, including to the athletes," said Alberto Murray Neto, a lawyer in Sao Paulo and former Brazilian Olympic committee member who opposed Rio's bid.
There is also a palpable dread that many Brazilians express privately that Rio will embarrass the country, that it will not be able to improve the choking traffic and that the city's urban blight and rampant drug-fueled violence will be laid bare for all the world to see.
"They are going to make the city pretty" for the event, said Helen Andrade, who works the front counter at a luncheonette here. "But just like they did with the Pan-Am games, they will throw a lot of spiffy-looking policemen at the situation and when it's over, one day later there won't be anything."
Still, "the Olympics gives us the perfect pretext to push ahead, in reforming the cities, in making more and more decisive efforts in reducing poverty," said Mr. de Souza, the political analyst. "This is an ongoing battle. But what we won today will be an essential driver in our efforts to improve the country."
On Copacabana Beach, the Cariocas bouncing a giant green beach ball emblazoned with the words "this is Rio's time" harbored no doubts or reservations. Couples kissed passionately between sips of beer. The drum corps Salgueiro, the samba school champion of the 2009 Carnaval, whipped the crowd into a frenzy.
"This is the moment for Rio, for South America," said Paulo Cesar, 30, as three tipsy friends chanted "Bra-zil!" behind him.
"The moment is now."

Abstract: When the music industry was "Napsterized" by free file-sharing, it suffered a blow from which it hasn't recovered. Since music sales peaked in 1999, the value of the industry's inflation-adjusted sales in the United States, even including sales from Apple's highly successful iTunes Music Store, has dropped by more than half, according to the Recording Industry Association of America.

Full text: YOU can buy "The Lost Symbol," by Dan Brown, as an e-book for $9.99 at Amazon.com.
Or you can don a pirate's cap and snatch a free copy from another online user at RapidShare, Megaupload, Hotfile and other file-storage sites.
Until now, few readers have preferred e-books to printed or audible versions, so the public availability of free-for-the-taking copies did not much matter. But e-books won't stay on the periphery of book publishing much longer. E-book hardware is on the verge of going mainstream. More dedicated e-readers are coming, with ever larger screens. So, too, are computer tablets that can serve as giant e-readers, and hardware that will not be very hard at all: a thin display flexible enough to roll up into a tube.
With the new devices in hand, will book buyers avert their eyes from the free copies only a few clicks away that have been uploaded without the copyright holder's permission? Mindful of what happened to the music industry at a similar transitional juncture, book publishers are about to discover whether their industry is different enough to be spared a similarly dismal fate.
The book industry has not received cheery news for a while. Publishers and authors alike have relied upon sales of general-interest hardcover books as the foundation of the business. The Association of American Publishers estimated that these hardcover sales in the United States declined 13 percent in 2008, versus the previous year. This year, these sales were down 15.5 percent through July, versus the same period of 2008. Total e-book sales, though up considerably this year, remained small, at $81.5 million, or 1.6 percent of total book sales through July.
"We are seeing lots of online piracy activities across all kinds of books -- pretty much every category is turning up," said Ed McCoyd, an executive director at the association. "What happens when 20 to 30 percent of book readers use digital as the primary mode of reading books? Piracy's a big concern."
Adam Rothberg, vice president for corporate communications at Simon & Schuster, said: "Everybody in the industry considers piracy a significant issue, but it's been difficult to quantify the magnitude of the problem. We know people post things but we don't know how many people take them."
We do know that people have been helping themselves to digital music without paying. When the music industry was "Napsterized" by free file-sharing, it suffered a blow from which it hasn't recovered. Since music sales peaked in 1999, the value of the industry's inflation-adjusted sales in the United States, even including sales from Apple's highly successful iTunes Music Store, has dropped by more than half, according to the Recording Industry Association of America.
A report earlier this year by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, based on multiple studies in 16 countries covering three years, estimated that 95 percent of music downloads "are unauthorized, with no payment to artists and producers."
Free file-sharing of e-books will most likely come to be associated with RapidShare, a file-hosting company based in Switzerland. It says its customers have uploaded onto its servers more than 10 petabytes of files -- that's more than 10 million gigabytes -- and can handle up to three million users simultaneously. Anyone can upload, and anyone can download; for light users, the service is free. RapidShare does not list the files -- a user must know the impossible-to-guess U.R.L. in order to download one.
But anyone who wants to make a file widely available simply publishes the U.R.L. and a description somewhere online, like a blog or a discussion forum, and Google and other search engines notice. No passwords protect the files.
"As far as we can tell, RapidShare is the largest host site of pirated material," Mr. McCoyd said. "Some publishers are saying half of all infringements are linked to it."
When I asked Katharina Scheid, a spokeswoman for RapidShare, if the company had a general sense of what kinds of material were most often placed on its servers -- music? videos? other kinds of content? -- she said she could not say because "for us, everything is just a file, no matter what."
At my request, Attributor, a company based in Redwood City, Calif., that offers publishers antipiracy services, did a search last week to see how many e-book copies of "The Lost Symbol" were available free on the Web. After verifying that each file claiming to be the book actually was, Attributor reported that 166 copies of the e-book were available on 11 sites. RapidShare accounted for 102.
Ms. Scheid said her company complied with publishers' take-down requests. But the request must refer to a particular file and use the specific U.R.L.; it's left to the publishers to find all instances of a given book title on RapidShare's servers. (I can report that RapidShare acted promptly in September when my publisher, Simon & Schuster, asked it to remove an audiobook version of one of my own books and provided the U.R.L. for the one file.) According to Ms. Scheid, the company gets requests to remove about 1 to 2 percent of the files that are uploaded daily.
To protect users' privacy, however, she said RapidShare does not attempt to block the uploading of infringing material in the first place: "We don't do content filtering; we don't look into uploaded files." Once a file is removed, the company tries to keep perfectly identical files from being uploaded again, but she listed various ways that determined users can alter the files just enough to effectively circumvent these measures. (My book reappeared on RapidShare a few days after it was taken down.) Hotfile and Megaupload did not respond to requests for comment.
RapidShare and fellow online storage services say that their services help users share large files easily or store personal data without having to carry around a memory stick. On the F.A.Q.'s page of its Web site, Megaupload depicts its customers as the most ordinary of citizens: "Students, professional business people, moms, dads, doctors, plumbers, insurance salesmen, mortgage brokers, you name it."
Publishers and authors are about the only groups that go unmentioned. Ms. Scheid, of RapidShare, has advice for them if they are unhappy that her company's users are distributing e-books without paying the copyright holders: Learn from the band Nine Inch Nails. It marketed itself "by giving away most of their content for free."
I will forward the suggestion along, as soon as authors can pack arenas full and pirated e-books can serve as concert fliers.

Full text: the stock market equivalent of an appliance chain's millionth customer, or the gazillionth hamburger served at McDonald's.
Still, the Dow, which closed up 124.17 points, at 9,789.36, on Monday, is within reach of 10,000. Who would have thought?
At the depths of Wall Street's crisis, when traders were despairing and shares of Citigroup were trading for just over a dollar, Dow 5,000 seemed a likelier prospect than this.
But now, one of the most-watched measures of the financial world is on the cusp of jumping back to five-digit territory.
That does not mean the economy's problems are over, or that 401(k)'s are going to be made whole anytime soon. In fact, this milestone could even stall the rally if enough investors use it as an opportunity to cash in their gains, analysts say.
But a big round number is often seen as a way of assessing the market's health, and whether it has enough juice to climb much higher.
"Will 10,000 make a difference to some people?" said Stuart Freeman, senior equity strategist at Wells Fargo Advisors. "It's psychological, but if enough people act on it, it's meaningful. The higher a market goes, the more that those on the sideline sit there and are concerned they're missing something. It takes a while for their fear to wear off." Indeed, investors who pulled out of the market as Wall Street crumbled would have missed a Dow that has rebounded more than 3,000 points in seven months. The Nasdaq index is up 35 percent since the start of the year, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is up more than 17 percent.
Some of the recession's biggest winners are again flying high, with stocks like Goldman Sachs closing at $182.50 a share. JPMorgan Chase reported nearly $3 billion in quarterly profits this summer. Shares of Apple are flirting with record highs.
Much of the run-up has been fueled by signs that some corners of Wall Street, helped by Washington's taxpayer lifelines, have returned to functioning almost normally. Corporate mergers and public stock offerings appear to have rebounded in recent weeks, pulling the market higher. Short-term loans are flowing. Companies with better credit can again raise money without paying huge risk premiums.
Yet the Dow at 10,000 could also herald a pause in the white-knuckle rally.
Analysts are divided about whether the stock market is overpriced or underpriced now, but stocks have gotten much more expensive since the main indexes hit their lowest points in a decade in early March. A share of Bank of America, which was selling for a little more than $3 in March, now costs $17. Shares of the American International Group, the corporate image of the financial crisis, have surged sixfold, although the price is still a small fraction of what it was before the government rescued the company.
And even if the recession is technically nearing an end, 15 million people are still unemployed, and stagnant incomes and higher rates of personal saving could reduce corporate revenue growth to a trickle for years to come.
Then there are the potential new waves of mortgage foreclosures; fresh losses in commercial real estate; consumer defaults on credit cards; and the possibility of another bubble in oil prices, all of which could prevent markets from enjoying anything like exuberance for a while.
"The bottom line reality is, it's still an economy that's in the midst of a major change," said Bill O'Grady, chief market strategist at Confluence Investment Management. "The real debate that underlies the Dow 10,000 story is the raging debate about what is going to be the form of the recovery."
The enthusiasm over that round figure is now a decade-long phenomenon. Consider this: President Bill Clinton was in office when the Dow Jones industrial average first closed above 10,000 in March 1999. It retreated in the years after the dot-com bubble deflated, then retook 10,000 in late 2003 and peaked at 14,000 in October 2007. We all know the cataclysm that followed.
So Dow 10,000 does not mean that the market is finally edging ahead; it is simply catching up to where it was a decade ago. "It's been a bad 10 years, a really bad 10 years," said David Bianco, chief United States equity strategist at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.
The constant march of inflation also dilutes the meaning of 10,000. Prices rose an average of about 2.8 percent each year in the last decade, meaning the Dow would have to reach about 13,200 in today's numbers to equal its value then. If this limbo seems dreary, imagine spending the next decade talking about Dow 10,000.
The Dow first closed above 100 points in 1906, when Theodore Roosevelt was president and American Car and Foundry and National Lead were members of the index. And it did not go much higher from there. It was still trading close to 100 as the 1920s began, then spiked at the end of the Roaring Twenties. But it crashed during the Depression, and was once again hovering around 100 as the United States entered World War II.
In 1966, the Dow came within 20 points of hitting 1,000, then fell off sharply. The stock index kept bumping its head against that threshold for more than 15 years as the American economy endured high inflation, oil embargoes, price controls and regular swings in the stock markets.
Not until 1982 did the Dow move decisively above 1,000.
"You can spend years around a particular milestone," said Tobias Levkovich, chief United States equity strategist at Citigroup. "I'm not talking about a year or two. I'm talking about way more than 10. They're not short-term phenomena."
The New York Times ran a front-page article about the Dow's first trip across the 10,000 marker in 1999. This article is being written in September 2009. Investors should hope there will not be a similar article in 2019.

World Bank Head Expects Dollar's Role to Diminish

Abstract: Mr. Zoellick, who previously served as the United States trade representative and as deputy secretary of state under President George W. Bush, said that the euro provided a "respectable alternative" for financing international transactions and that there was "every reason to believe that the euro's acceptability could grow."

Full text: The president of the World Bank said on Monday that America's days as an unchallenged economic superpower might be numbered and that the dollar was likely to lose its favored position as the euro and the Chinese renminbi assume bigger roles.
"The United States would be mistaken to take for granted the dollar's place as the world's predominant reserve currency," the World Bank president, Robert B. Zoellick, said in a speech at the School for Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins. "Looking forward, there will increasingly be other options to the dollar."
Mr. Zoellick, who previously served as the United States trade representative and as deputy secretary of state under President George W. Bush, said that the euro provided a "respectable alternative" for financing international transactions and that there was "every reason to believe that the euro's acceptability could grow."
In the next 10 to 20 years, he said, the dollar will face growing competition from China's currency, the renminbi. Though Chinese leaders have minimized their currency's use in international transactions, largely so they could keep greater control over exchange rates, Mr. Zoellick said the renminbi would "evolve into a force in financial markets."
The World Bank, which is financed by governments around the globe and lends money primarily to poor countries, has no say over the economic policies of large nations or over currency matters.
But Mr. Zoellick's comments were unusual, in part because he seemed intent on being provocative. He argued that the United States and a handful of other rich nations could no longer dominate the world economy and suggested that America was losing its clout. He also took issue with a central piece of the Obama administration's proposal regarding the country's financial regulatory system.
"The greenback's fortunes will depend heavily on U.S. choices," Mr. Zoellick said. "Will the United States resolve its debt problems without a resort to inflation? Can America establish long-term discipline over spending and its budget deficit?"
Mr. Zoellick criticized President Obama's plan to put the Federal Reserve in charge of reducing "systemic risk" and to regulate institutions considered too big to fail. Saying that Congress had become uneasy about the Fed's exercise of emergency powers to bail out financial institutions and prop up credit markets, Mr. Zoellick argued that the Treasury rather than the Fed should get more power because the Treasury was more accountable to Congress.
"In the United States, it will be difficult to vest the independent and powerful technocrats at the Federal Reserve with more authority," Mr. Zoellick said, adding that "the Treasury is an executive department, and therefore Congress and the public can more directly oversee how it uses any added authority."

Abstract: After stumbling in his transition from backstage player to out-front crisis manager, Mr. Geithner has since quieted critics inside and outside the administration at a time when health care and foreign policy challenges increasingly command the headlines. First he survived a confirmation controversy over unpaid taxes; later he drew fire for comments about Chinese currency policies that some analysts considered too blunt.

Full text: The startling disclosure of a secret Iranian nuclear facility late last week shoved the results of the G-20 economic conference here off center stage.
That was hardly surprising, since the conference was intended as a stay-the-course session affirming the promising early results of coordinated efforts to revive the global economy. And it was nothing new in the career of Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, a principal architect of those policies who is among the least prepossessing figures in an administration of large personalities.
Before taking the Treasury job, "I had spent most of my life trying not to be on television," Mr. Geithner said in an interview here. Indeed, results so far suggest that is where he does his best work.
After stumbling in his transition from backstage player to out-front crisis manager, Mr. Geithner has since quieted critics inside and outside the administration at a time when health care and foreign policy challenges increasingly command the headlines. But with the economy still hovering between recession and recovery, multiple tests of his judgment and political dexterity lie ahead.
A Shaky Start
Mr. Geithner made his professional reputation over two decades of behind-the-scenes government work that began in the Reagan-era Treasury Department. His profile rose considerably last fall as president of the New York Federal Reserve, when he joined President George W. Bush's Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., and the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, in the frantic effort to prevent financial collapse.
His public struggles began when Mr. Obama chose him as Treasury secretary. First he survived a confirmation controversy over unpaid taxes; later he drew fire for comments about Chinese currency policies that some analysts considered too blunt.
Mr. Geithner's shaky initial rollout of a plan to help banks clean up so-called toxic assets generated calls for his ouster. Rahm Emanuel, the White House chief of staff, grew concerned enough about Treasury's performance that he escalated his own involvement in the department's affairs.
As it happened, the toxic asset plan's signal contribution was the announcement itself; the increase in market confidence it engendered all but obviated the need for financial institutions to use it. Meanwhile, signs that economic growth is resuming have eased the sense of crisis surrounding Mr. Geithner's work.
The economic "message" meetings in Mr. Emanuel's office have slowed from daily to weekly. The administration's immediate domestic priority is health care, while foreign policy challenges with Iran and the war in Afghanistan have gained fresh urgency.
Aides say the president never lost confidence in Mr. Geithner, who was born two weeks after Mr. Obama in August 1961. Mr. Emanuel said Mr. Obama values the same quality in Mr. Geithner that he values in himself: the ability to "stay calm and focused and dispassionate in a storm."
Tempering Populism
Conservatives continue accusing Team Obama of dangerously expanding government control over the economy, from Wall Street to Detroit. But some Bush White House veterans credit Mr. Geithner with tempering the populist impulses of other Obama advisers.
One example: the administration has resisted calls, domestically and from G-20 allies like France, for specific dollar limits on executive compensation in the financial industry. "He's doing as good a job as he can under the circumstances," said Lawrence B. Lindsey, once Mr. Bush's top economic adviser.
Such praise only fuels those on the left who cast Mr. Geithner as a tool of Wall Street interests for having rebuffed their calls to nationalize troubled banks.
"Progressives have been disappointed," said Robert L. Borosage, director of the Committee for America's Future. But he added, "I don't think we see a lot of distance between Obama and Geithner."
Mr. Geithner proved that point by successfully pushing for Mr. Obama to reappoint Mr. Bernanke, his close ally in the battles of the last year. The decision was fraught because a leading alternative was the National Economic Council director, Lawrence H. Summers, Mr. Geithner's onetime mentor in the Clinton Treasury Department. Staying put in his current job, Mr. Summers will remain as a rival to Mr. Geithner for influence over administration economic policy.
The president's decision to impose tariffs on imported Chinese tires, which Mr. Geithner opposed, showed he does not win every argument. Over the next year, he will face a raft of new fights over financial regulation in Congress, deficit reduction, and when to roll back Washington's economic interventions.
That rollback may be the toughest strategic choice, pitting inflation fears against persistently high unemployment. Kevin M. Warsh, a Fed governor, warned in The Wall Street Journal last week that "policy likely will need to begin normalization before it is obvious it is necessary, possibly with greater force than is customary."
His early public battering largely behind him, Mr. Geithner sounded sanguine last week. "As long as I feel confident we're making the best decisions among a set of options," he concluded, "I feel good."

Full text: CORRECTION: Because of an editing error, an article on Sept. 27 about Wu Jinglian, the Chinese economist, misattributed a quotation about market reform efforts in the 1980s. It was Bao Tong, a former aide to Zhao Ziyang, the Chinese economic planner -- not Mr. Wu -- who said, ''For the first guys who advocated a market system, it was pretty dangerous.''
AT 79, Wu Jinglian is considered China's most famous economist.
In the 1980s and '90s, he was an adviser to China's leaders, including Deng Xiaoping. He helped push through some of this country's earliest market reforms, paving the way for China's spectacular rise and earning him the nickname "Market Wu."
Last year, China's state-controlled media slapped him with a new moniker: spy.
Mr. Wu has not been interrogated, charged or imprisoned. But the fact that a state newspaper, The People's Daily, among others, was allowed to publish Internet rumors alleging that he had been detained on suspicions of being a spy for the United States hints that he is annoying some very important people in the government.
He denied the allegations, and soon after they were published, China's cabinet denied that an investigation was under way.
But in a country that often jails critics, Mr. Wu seems to be testing the limits of what Beijing deems permissible. While many economists argue that China's growth model is flawed, rarely does a prominent Chinese figure, in the government or out, speak with such candor about flaws he sees in China's leadership.
Mr. Wu -- who still holds a research post at an institute affiliated with the State Council, China's cabinet -- has white hair and an amiable face, and he appears frail. But his assessments are often harsh. In books, speeches, interviews and television appearances, he warns that conservative hardliners in the Communist Party have gained influence in the government and are trying to dismantle the market reforms he helped formulate.
He complains that business tycoons and corrupt officials have hijacked the economy and manipulated it for their own ends, a system he calls crony capitalism. He has even called on Beijing to establish a British-style democracy, arguing that political reform is inevitable.
Provocative statements have made him a kind of dissident economist here, and revealed the sharp debates behind the scenes, at the highest levels of the Communist Party, about the direction of China's half-market, half-socialist economy.
In many ways, it is a continuation of the debate that has been raging for three decades: What role should the government play in China's hybrid economy?
Mr. Wu says the spy rumors were "dirty tricks" employed by his critics to discredit him.
"I have two enemies," he said in a recent interview. "The crony capitalists and the Maoists. They will use any means to attack me."
Nevertheless, some analysts believe that Mr. Wu's critiques are aiding one government faction in a power struggle with another, and that he is protected.
His pro-market ideas have influenced a generation of younger economists who now hold senior government posts, including Zhou Xiaochuan, the leader of China's central bank, and Lou Jiwei, chairman of the country's huge sovereign wealth fund.
"He is like the father of economics here," says Laurence Brahm, who wrote several books about China's reform period. "What he said was the blueprint for reform."
Critics say Mr. Wu's influence on government is waning. (They note that he is not invited to weekly economics seminars held for top leaders, including Prime Minister Wen Jiabao.)
Given this, some people say, Mr. Wu is courting danger by speaking out.
"You have to remember, China is a dictatorship," says Victor Shih, a professor of political science at Northwestern University. "If they want to shut him up, they can."
GIVEN the risks, it's hard not to wonder why one of the architects of China's reforms has turned so negative, so angry and so defiant.
Mr. Wu's personality and tumultuous life story provide some clues.Even his supporters acknowledge that he has a combative streak and describe him as a stubborn idealist whose verbal jousting skills were honed during years of hardship and political warfare.
"He always expressed his ideas in the sharpest way," says Zhang Chunlin, who was a student of Mr. Wu. "He's not diplomatic. Even at close to 80 years old, he argues with journalists."
That he has lived such a long life would have surprised his parents, wealthy intellectuals who ran one of the country's largest independent newspapers, in Nanjing. A sickly child with tuberculosis, he was not expected to live past the age of 1. He spent much of his youth confined to bed, reading Russian novels and the works of Lu Xun, an influential Chinese writer from the 1920s.
One of his earliest memories is arriving in the wartime capital, Chongqing, in 1937, at the age of 7, as his family fled Nanjing and the invading Japanese. The emaciated rickshaw driver stopped for opium; the destitute were everywhere.
"In Shanghai or Nanjing, beggars would help you and then ask for money," he recalls. "But in Chongqing, they'd grab food from your mouth."
Such experiences helped mold him into an idealistic socialist, as many Chinese were during that era. He studied Marxist economics in college and graduated with honors in 1954 from Fudan University in Shanghai. That won him a position at the country's elite research institute, the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing.
Soon after he arrived, however, China was engulfed by political campaigns, like the Great Leap Forward, that required little research. The cruelest was the Cultural Revolution, from 1966 to 1976, when intellectuals and the descendants of landlords were identified as "counterrevolutionaries." In Beijing, Mr. Wu says, Red Guards shaved half the head of his wife, Zhou Nan, and ransacked his mother's home.
Mao Zedong wanted intellectuals sent to the countryside to be "re-educated." So in 1969, virtually the entire Academy was sent to Henan Province to learn to farm and to build houses in remote villages.
Ms. Zhou was ordered to work as a peasant in Shanxi Province; their two children, ages 4 and 6, were left with relatives in Beijing.
"When I left, I was prepared never to return home again," Mr. Wu says solemnly. "We were told we'd farm for the rest of our lives."
Mr. Wu says the hardships included sessions in which he was denounced as an anti-Maoist. When pressed to confess, or to denounce others, he says he refused, and then was beaten and placed in solitary confinement.
"They sent me to the stage to confess, then they started beating me," he says. "Of course I felt extreme anger. But I realized it wouldn't last for long; it was too absurd."
This didn't shake his faith in socialism, but he began to distrust the people around Mao who were calling believers like him enemies of the people.
His only solace, he later said, was the friendship he developed with a scholar named Gu Zhun, who was an early critic of central planning, and an advocate of market reform. Mr. Gu encouraged him to learn English and to explore the outside world, which Mr. Gu said was the only hope for China to develop.
When Mr. Wu returned home three years later, in 1972, his daughter said he was still "under the spell of Communism," partly because of the guilt he felt for having grown up in a wealthy home.
"He said a person should have just one shirt," recalls his daughter, Shelley, 46. "And he didn't like my sister and I to write our names on our personal property."
AFTER the Cultural Revolution ended with Mao's death in 1976, Mr. Wu says he began to see that Mao's economic policies had brought the country to the brink of collapse.
In 1978, when Deng Xiaoping began to press ahead with bold reforms aimed at opening up the country, Mr. Wu was heavily influenced by the thought and advice of his colleague Mr. Gu, who had died in 1974. He learned English, and in 1983 went to Yale as a visiting scholar. Much of his time there was spent studying modern economic theory.
Mr. Wu returned to Beijing in 1984, just as China's economic reforms were gathering momentum under Zhao Ziyang, the party leader and chief economic planner.
That year, Mr. Wu says he helped Ma Hong, a top government adviser, draft a paper that defined the country's shift from a planned to a market economy. "This was a very important turning point for China's economy," he says.
Once the proposal was accepted, Mr. Wu was elevated to the Development Research Center, the institute affiliated with the powerful State Council. Soon, he was visiting Zhongnanhai, Beijing's leadership compound, to offer advice and debate economic policy.
Several research institutes advised Mr. Zhao and Mr. Deng on how to remake the old socialist system with elements of free enterprise. Some who sat in on those meetings say that Mr. Wu was argumentative and prickly when debating economic policy, even with Mr. Zhao.
The reforms, though, fueled strong growth and are widely credited with changing the course of the nation.
But by the late 1980s the reforms also opened the doors to corruption and soaring inflation, feeding public anger that contributed to the 1989 student demonstrations in Tiananmen Square.
Mr. Zhao was removed from office just ahead of the bloody assault on the students and the campaign against dissent and "liberalization." The reforms stalled.
Not long after, Mr. Wu and other reformers were attacked for favoring a Western-style market system.
Bao Tong, a former aide to Mr. Zhao, said the reformers faced strong opposition from Soviet-trained economists who were wedded to the ideas of central planning.
"For the first guys who advocated a market system, it was pretty dangerous," Mr. Wu said in a recent telephone interview.
He was among them, and so he was derisively branded "Market Wu." For a time, publishers refused to sell his books.
"That's when the conservatives came in and said the reforms had messed everything up," says Barry J. Naughton, a professor at the University of California, San Diego, and author of "The Chinese Economy."
Mr. Naughton says: "Wu Jinglian fought against the backlash. He said, 'We need more market reform, not less.' "
The reform camp became stronger after Mr. Deng's famous 1992 "southern tour" -- in which he called for bolder reforms and encouraged people to get rich.
Soon, Mr. Wu's influence in government grew. In the 1990s, he served as an adviser to Zhu Rongji and Jiang Zemin, the country's top leaders, helping them speed up reforms and restructure badly run state-owned companies.
Every step of the way, he fought off opposition, and debated, often publicly, the shape and pace of the reforms.
"This debate about the market economy is the most important discussion throughout the 30 years of reform," says Liang Guiquan, an economist at the Guangdong Academy of Social Sciences. "And it's still going on now. Wu Jinglian has always been at the center of that debate."
BY most measures, China's economic transformation has been a resounding success. Anyone who travels here can see it: the change in people's living standards, the makeover of big cities -- what has come to be called China's economic miracle.
But Mr. Wu sees the defects: a government prone to "meddling" in the marketplace; a widening income gap; inefficient monopolies; and crony capitalism.
His critique sharpened considerably after Jiang Zemin stepped down as president in 2003, and Mr. Wu's role was diminished.
In interviews, Mr. Wu says he feels compelled to speak out because conservatives and "old-style Maoists" have been gaining influence in the government since 2004. These groups, he said, are pressing for a return to central planning and placing blame for corruption and social inequality on the very market reforms he championed.
At the same time, Mr. Wu says, corrupt bureaucrats are pushing for the state to take a larger economic role so they can cash in on their positions through payoffs and bribes, as well as by steering business to allies.
"I'm not optimistic about the future," Mr. Wu said. "The Maoists want to go back to central planning and the cronies want to get richer."

Democrats Preserve Essence of Health Proposal

Full text: Senate Democrats on Friday preserved the guts of their proposal to reinvent the health care system, but Republicans scored political points on several issues, like the effects of the bill on older Americans.
The Democrats beat back Republican attacks on the legislation as the Senate Finance Committee deferred some of the most contentious issues to next week.
By a vote of 14 to 9, the committee rejected an amendment by Senator Jon Kyl, Republican of Arizona, that would have prohibited the federal government from defining the specific health benefits that insurers must offer. The government would prescribe a minimum package of benefits under all health bills pending in Congress.
On the other side of the Capitol, Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Friday that Democratic leaders were considering a tax on high-cost health insurance policies to help finance coverage of the uninsured.
The bill pending in the Senate Finance Committee would raise more than $200 billion over 10 years by imposing such a tax on health plans with premiums exceeding $8,000 for individuals and $21,000 for families.
House Democratic leaders and committee chairmen showed no interest in such a tax earlier this year. They have drafted a sweeping health care bill that would impose a surtax on families with incomes of more than $350,000 a year. Ms. Pelosi has said she would like to raise the threshold to $1 million.
That would reduce the amount of revenue raised. To make up the difference, House leaders are examining the idea of a tax on high-end insurance plans.
But many Democrats have reservations about the idea, in part because they believe that insurers would pass on the cost to employers and employees.
Representative Joe Courtney, Democrat of Connecticut, said some teachers in his state could be affected.
"A tax on health benefits in the name of reform will punish middle-class residents from states with high medical costs who have no control over medical inflation," Mr. Courtney said. "It would be a bitter pill for these working families to pay a tax on benefits that were preserved through wage and salary concessions for the last two decades."
Three House committees approved comprehensive health care bills in July. Ms. Pelosi met for three hours on Friday with her leadership team and with chairmen of the three committees, who are trying to reach a consensus before they take a bill to the House floor this fall.
When the Finance Committee resumes work next week, it will tackle dozens of proposed amendments.
The committee chairman, Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, had said the panel on Friday would take up the explosive question of whether to create a government-run insurance plan, to compete with private insurers. But he decided to put the issue off until Tuesday.
"This was a good week," Mr. Baucus said. "It was a productive week."
Republicans did not prevail on any amendments to which Democrats objected. But Senator Michael B. Enzi of Wyoming said he and other Republicans had effectively publicized two messages: that the bill would do little to bring down the cost of insurance and that it would, in effect, tap Medicare to help pay for coverage of the uninsured.
A new report from the Congressional Budget Office analyzes possible effects of the legislation on premiums in the individual insurance market. Such premiums, it said, "would tend to be higher" because "the new policies would have to cover pre-existing medical conditions and could not deny coverage to people with high expected costs for health care."
However, the report noted that some people with serious illnesses did not buy insurance now because they could not afford the premiums.
Mr. Kyl said that federal benefit mandates would increase the cost of insurance. Senator Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan, said such requirements were needed because many insurance policies did not cover important services like maternity care.
Mr. Kyl insisted, "I don't need maternity care."
But Ms. Stabenow said, "Your mom probably did."
Public access to the text of the legislation has emerged as an issue in the Senate and the House. Ms. Pelosi said the legislation would be posted on the Web for lawmakers and the public to read and review for at least 72 hours before the House votes. Mr. Baucus agreed that a detailed summary of his bill, in plain English, would be publicly available before a final committee vote.

Abstract: [...] you gather all your receipts and send them in for reimbursement. John Hickman, an Atlanta lawyer who heads the employee benefits practice for Alston & Bird, is quick to point out that employers have to satisfy federal tests to make sure that the benefits of a flexible spending account plan are not going only to the fat cats.

Full text: The tumult at the town hall meetings has mostly died down and the debates over socialized medicine have gotten a bit old for everyone. But the fate of a benefit that puts hundreds of millions of dollars in Americans' pockets each year remained unresolved this week, with senators pitching in with suggestions to keep as much money as possible in the hands of their constituents.
Who would have thought that so many people would go to the mat over the lowly flexible spending account?
Flexible spending accounts allow people to take money out of their paychecks before paying taxes on it and to set it aside to use for health care expenses that insurance doesn't cover. There is no legal limit on how much you can set aside each year, though employers generally set a cap around $4,000 or $5,000.
Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana and author of the Senate health care bill, would like to place a much lower $2,500 annual limit on what people can save, among other restrictions. The House-Senate Joint Committee on Taxation figures this will allow the government to take in $14.6 billion from 2011 and 2019. So far so good right? We have to pay for the health care bill somehow.
The problem, however, is that to people who put more than $2,500 away each year, this looks an awful lot like a tax increase. After all, if they can't put as much money aside, they'll pay more in income and payroll taxes. And President Obama, when he was running for office, promised that no family earning under $250,000 would see higher taxes.
Now, a not-quite grass-roots effort has sprung up, led by companies that administer flexible spending accounts and others. At savemyflexplan.org, the group encourages individuals to write their representatives in Washington and sound off.
The question, however, is whether this is something worth fighting for.
Flexible spending accounts are great in theory. They can cover co-pays and deductibles, birth control and abortion, Lasik and glasses. Orthodontists love them, since braces are eligible, too.
In practice, however, the accounts are a hassle. You take money out of your paycheck once to finance the account. Then you reach into your wallet for the health care expenses themselves, effectively fronting the money for a second time. Finally, you gather all your receipts and send them in for reimbursement. While there are now debit cards that allow you to pay for expenses directly from the spending account, not every practitioner accepts them. And the card companies often demand receipts anyway to prove you bought aspirin and not candy at the drugstore.
This isn't the real reason the accounts are in senators' sights, though. One factor is this: If you don't use the money in your account within a year (or during the two-and-a-half-month extension that the government also allows), you lose it and your company keeps it. This inevitably leads to the annual goofball ritual of people running around town buying glasses or loading up on contact lens solution before the deadline.
And that's if you're lucky. Uwe E. Reinhardt, an economics professor at Princeton who is not a fan of the accounts, wrote a post earlier this year on the Economix blog at NYTimes.com noting that his wife once scheduled year-end, his-and-her colonoscopies to spend their funds.
Drugstore.com even has a flexible spending account mini-store on its site, so that no one should be confused about what they can spend their money on. All of these spending sprees with leftover funds may well encourage more health care spending than is necessary.
Detractors also complain that wealthy people benefit the most from the accounts. After all, the more you earn, the higher your income tax rates. And the higher your income tax rates, the more you stand to save by putting pretax money in the accounts. And people who earn more usually have an easier time setting aside money in the first place.
John Hickman, an Atlanta lawyer who heads the employee benefits practice for Alston & Bird, is quick to point out that employers have to satisfy federal tests to make sure that the benefits of a flexible spending account plan are not going only to the fat cats. One existing rule keeps a company's owners and officers from deriving more than a quarter of the plan's benefits, while another new rule makes sure that the highly paid in general don't benefit disproportionately.
Meanwhile, Jody Dietel, the chief compliance officer at WageWorks, which helps companies administer about 1.5 million accounts, notes that the average salary of its participants is about $55,000. She also says there are about 35 million people covered under health care flexible spending accounts. They can't all be rich, right?
Even if they aren't wealthy, however, the people who have these plans are certainly privileged. First of all, they have to be employed (and not self-employed, since soloists aren't eligible unless a spouse has access to a plan and can cover the whole family). Then, they have to work for an employer willing to set up the accounts and deal with their continuing management. Most employers willing to do this probably already offer decent health insurance.
So you can start to see why a $2,500 limit on these accounts looks like a ripe target for legislators hoping to pay for health insurance for people who have none. "Today, only a minority of workers have access to these accounts, and most of those contributions are already well below this limit," Erin Shields, press secretary for the Senate Committee on Finance, said in an e-mail message.
The problem with this line of reasoning, however, is that there are plenty of middle-class people who do put aside more than $2,500 to pay for diabetes or asthma medication or treatment for other chronic conditions. Large families also often set aside much more than the proposed limit. They will lose out if the $2,500 cap stays in place, especially if it doesn't rise with inflation.
This part of the health care bill would be a lot more palatable if it achieved its savings by capping the household income of people who can participate. So if your household income is under, say, $100,000 on the 2009 tax return that you file in 2010, you could participate in a plan in 2011.
But that option isn't on the table, and it isn't clear why. One possible explanation is that the $100,000 figure could provide even more political ammunition for anyone trying to claim that those who earn between $100,000 and $250,000 would then be facing a tax increase -- and that President Obama broke his promise.
It's probably too late for a more sensible solution to emerge, but one can always hope. In the meantime, be aware that the days of setting aside $4,000 each year to pay for designer prescription sunglasses and therapeutic massages are probably numbered.
Use that tax break before you lose it, because many of you probably don't deserve to have it in the first place.

Full text: The housing market, a source of so many of the country's economic problems, caused more headaches for Wall Street on Thursday.
Stocks fell after a real estate group reported that sales of existing homes dropped 2.7 percent in August. The figures disappointed economists and investors, who had been expecting a fifth consecutive month of gains.
The Dow Jones industrial average declined 41.11 points, or 0.4 percent, to close at 9,707.44. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 10.09 points, or 1 percent, to 1,050.78, while the Nasdaq composite index fell 23.81 points, or 1.1 percent, to 2,107.61.
The selling ran through many sectors of the market. Big banks and regional lenders that offer mortgages and construction loans were down. Shares of major home builders like Lennar and D. R. Horton sank, as did big industrial companies like Caterpillar and manufacturers that make the materials used to build homes and offices.
And energy companies like Chevron and Marathon Oil fell as the price of crude oil slid $3.08, to $65.89 a barrel, the lowest in more than a month. Oil prices have swung between $65 and $70 a barrel for much of the summer as traders have tried to determine whether a strong rebound will spur demand for oil, or whether a faltering one will keep consumption low.
For many investors, the dip in sales of existing homes reflected broader worries about how the economy would perform as a panoply of support programs from the government slowly wind down. They worry that consumers and markets have become so dependent on public lifelines that the process of withdrawing them could be painful, at least in the short term.
A tax credit of up to $8,000 for first-time buyers has driven home sales higher this summer, and some investors and real estate groups are worried that home sales will pull back once the credit expires at the end of November.
On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve said it would gradually slow down a $1.45 trillion program to buy mortgage-backed securities, which was aimed at keeping interest rates low, stretching it out through the end of March.
The Fed said on Wednesday that inflation remained a remote concern, making safer investments like Treasuries more attractive to investors worried about swings in the economy or in the stock market.
In a sign of robust demand, prices of Treasury securities rose. The benchmark 10-year note was up 10/32, to 102 1/32, and the yield fell to 3.38 percent, from 3.42 percent late Wednesday, as investors considered the prospect of a slow recovery in the housing market.
"Auctions all week went very well," said James Combias, head of United States government bond trading at Mizuho Securities. "There's been a lot of buying of Treasuries. It will dry up. The question is when."
Following are the results of Thursday's auction of seven-year notes:

Abstract: Senator Bill Nelson of Florida desperately wants to expand health insurance coverage because one in five Floridians is uninsured.

Full text: Senator Bill Nelson of Florida desperately wants to expand health insurance coverage because one in five Floridians is uninsured. As a former state insurance commissioner, he wants to crack down on insurers. And as a member of the Senate Finance Committee, he can shape legislation to achieve both goals.
But Mr. Nelson, a Democrat, has a big problem. The bill taken up this week by the committee would cut Medicare payments to insurance companies that care for more than 10 million older Americans, including nearly one million in Florida. The program, known as Medicare Advantage, is popular because it offers extra benefits, including vision and dental care and even, in some cases, membership in health clubs or fitness centers.
"It would be intolerable to ask senior citizens to give up substantial health benefits they are enjoying under Medicare," said Mr. Nelson, who has been deluged with calls and complaints from constituents. "I am offering an amendment to shield seniors from those benefit cuts."
Similar concerns exploded into public view on Wednesday as members of the Finance Committee slogged though a mammoth health care overhaul bill for a second day.
To help offset the cost of covering the uninsured, the Senate and House bills would squeeze roughly $400 billion to $500 billion out of the projected growth in Medicare over 10 years.
Republicans on Wednesday accused Democrats of using Medicare as a piggy bank to pay for coverage of the uninsured. Democrats countered by saying they were eliminating overpayments to insurance companies and extending the life of the Medicare trust fund, which could run out of money in 2017.
Senator Nelson said Republicans were waging a "scare campaign," but he shares some of their concerns. His predicament highlights the political risks for Democrats eager to reassure older Americans who vote in large numbers.
There are risks for President Obama as well. He cannot afford to lose Mr. Nelson's vote. White House officials have offered to work with him to address his concerns. Mr. Obama has said repeatedly that "if you like your health care plan, you will be able to keep it."
The cost of Mr. Nelson's proposed fix -- to preserve benefits for many people enrolled in the private Medicare plans -- could total $40 billion over 10 years, and that could also be a problem for the White House. Mr. Obama has promised not to sign a health bill that increases the deficit, and so far Mr. Nelson has not said precisely how he would pay for his amendment.
Approval of the amendment could invite other Democrats to ask for similar deals that might make the bill more palatable to their constituents, but more costly as well.
The legislation moving through Congress would make other huge changes in Medicare -- raising premiums for some higher-income beneficiaries, cutting payments to hospitals and nursing homes, and trimming payments for many "overvalued services" provided by doctors. The legislation includes provisions to measure the quality of care provided by doctors and hospitals and to reward those who cure patients or keep them healthy.
"It's disingenuous to say that Congress can cut this much spending from Medicare without having an adverse affect on seniors' access to health care," said Jon Kyl of Arizona, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate. "Seniors should not foot the bill for the uninsured. Medicare should not be the piggy bank for new non-Medicare spending, a new entitlement."
But the committee chairman, Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, said no money would actually be taken out of the Medicare trust fund.
"It's true that, under this legislation, there are savings in Medicare payments to providers," Mr. Baucus said. "But the effect is to extend the life of the Medicare trust fund by four or five years. We are improving Medicare benefits, decreasing prescription drug costs for seniors and eliminating out-of-pocket costs for recommended preventive care."
Mr. Nelson said he had received 56,000 telephone calls, letters and e-mail messages on the legislation since June.
Some of those callers have been mobilized by insurance companies.
Humana, one of the nation's largest insurers, has urged subscribers to contact their members of Congress and register their opposition to the cuts. "Millions of seniors and disabled individuals could lose many of the important benefits and services that make Medicare Advantage health plans so valuable," Humana said in a recent letter to beneficiaries.
On Monday, the Obama administration told Humana to "end immediately all such mailings to beneficiaries." It said the materials were "misleading and confusing." Insurers have contracts with Medicare, and under Medicare rules, many of their communications with beneficiaries need to be submitted to the government for review, administration officials said.
The Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, said the administration was trying to "squelch free speech" by Humana, which is based in Louisville. But Senator Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan, said Humana had "scared a lot of seniors unnecessarily."
The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, an independent federal body, says payments to the private plans are, on average, 14 percent higher than what the government would spend for the same people in traditional Medicare.
Mr. Baucus's bill would cut payments to Medicare Advantage plans by $123 billion over 10 years. Under a companion bill approved by three House committees, the cuts would total $156 billion. Mr. Obama proposed cuts totaling $175 billion. Insurers, he said, are getting "unwarranted subsidies" that "pad their profits but don't improve the care of seniors."
Mr. Baucus and House Democrats would save nearly $200 billion over 10 years by permanently reducing annual inflation adjustments in Medicare payments to hospitals and other providers. They would also cut special Medicare payments to hospitals serving large numbers of low-income people, on the assumption that more patients will have insurance.
Some of the Democrats' other proposals have drawn fire from groups that support the overall push for a health care overhaul.
AARP, the lobby for older Americans, objects to the proposal that could increase premiums for some beneficiaries. In 2003, Congress stipulated that any Medicare beneficiaries with more than $80,000 of income would have to pay higher premiums. The income threshold rises with the Consumer Price Index.
Senator Baucus has proposed freezing the current income threshold for 10 years. That would raise $23 billion, as more people would have to pay the higher premiums.
David M. Certner, legislative counsel at AARP, said, "It's unfair to single out seniors to pay more for their health benefits when other high-income people are not being asked to pay more."
Throughout it all, Mr. Nelson said he would remember advice he once received from Claude Pepper, a Florida congressman and champion for the elderly: "Bill, I want you to look out for our seniors. Someone has to look out for them."

Fed to Lower Safety Net, but Gingerly

Full text: The Federal Reserve, acknowledging that an economic recovery has begun, took a cautious step on Wednesday toward weaning the housing market off its trillion-dollar support program.
But even as policy makers expressed new optimism about growth, they also conveyed the difficulties that lie ahead in removing the vast safety net that they have erected over the last year.
"Economic activity has picked up following its severe downturn," the central bank said in a statement after a two-day policy meeting. It said financial markets had improved further, that activity in the housing market had increased and that household spending seemed to be stabilizing.
But Fed officials also cautioned that the recovery would be slow and repeated their vow to keep the benchmark overnight interest rate at virtually zero for "an extended period." That almost certainly means until at least sometime next year.
Policy makers also announced that they would slow down the Fed's program to buy almost $1.5 trillion worth of mortgage-related securities and stretch it out through the end of March.
That program is aimed at keeping mortgage rates low and propping up the housing market. But the Fed now dominates the mortgage market so much that many analysts predict it will be difficult for the central bank to extract itself.
"I don't think there are enough private buyers to replace the central bank," said Sung Won Sohn, professor of economics at California State University. "If there is even an inkling that the Fed is going to start selling by 2010, we would see mortgage rates go up right away."
Fed officials did not even hint at a timetable for selling the central bank's huge mortgage portfolio. But to prevent disruptions when it simply stops buying, the Fed said it would gradually phase out its purchases over the next six months.
Even that could cause heartburn for prospective home buyers. Analysts estimate that the Fed is buying more than 80 percent of new mortgage-backed securities.
Private investors have retreated to the sidelines, and no one is sure how rapidly they will return if the Fed retreats.
Ian Shepherdson, a forecaster at High Frequency Economics, said private credit markets were still so weak that an important measure of the money supply, known as M-2, had actually edged down in recent months. That is the opposite of what is supposed to happen under the Fed's policy of "quantitative easing," under which it creates large volumes of money out of thin air to buy Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities.
"That tells you that the volume of private credit is falling," Mr. Shepherdson said. If the Fed stops its purchases, he added, the money supply might fall sharply and make credit even harder to obtain. "I just wonder whether they have the stomach for that kind of contraction," he said.
The Fed's statement on Wednesday suggested that policy makers had become slightly more optimistic since their meeting in August. At the same time, policy makers left themselves ample room to keep rates low, contending that that high unemployment and unused factory capacity would keep inflation subdued for the foreseeable future.
The unemployment rate was 9.7 percent in September, its highest level since the early 1980s, and many analysts say they believe it will ultimately climb above 10 percent and remain well above its normal levels for several years.
In a sign that officials were worried about how jittery markets might become, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York issued an unusual follow-up statement on Wednesday to explain how it planned to scale back the purchase of mortgage securities.
It said the process would start this week, with its purchases of mortgage-backed securities gradually declining in volume. It also said it would gradually reduce both the frequency and the volume of its purchases of debt issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and other federal agencies that guarantee mortgages.
The Fed has already phased out some of the emergency lending programs it created during the financial crisis last fall. It is also wrapping up its program to buy $300 billion worth of Treasury bonds, stretching out its final purchases through the end of October.
Even so, the Fed's balance sheet has more than doubled over the last year, to about $2 trillion. And the mortgage-security program is both bigger than any of its other efforts and more central to the economy's core weakness -- the housing market.
Several of the Fed's more hawkish board members have pushed to end the mortgage program early, contending that it has displaced private investors and feeds inflationary pressures.
But the Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, has warned that ending the stimulus programs too quickly could tip the United States back into a recession -- the same mistake policy makers made in the 1930s. On Wednesday, the Fed's policy makers voted unanimously to finish buying all the securities they had originally planned but to end the purchases by the end of March.
Fed officials say they are under no pressure to raise interest rates quickly. With unemployment approaching 10 percent, and underemployment pushing the true jobless rate above 16 percent, Fed officials expect wage pressures to remain scant.
Largely because of the fall in oil prices this year, the government's Consumer Price Index has actually edged down 1.5 percent over the last 12 months. The Fed's preferred measure of inflation, which excludes the volatile prices of food and energy, has declined to an annual rate of 1.8 percent. Fed officials expect that rate to decline more over the next year, possibly below 1 percent.

Profit at General Mills Tops Expectations

Full text: General Mills posted a higher-than-expected quarterly profit and raised its full-year earnings forecast, helped by strong sales of products like its breakfast cereals in the United States.
General Mills has counted on a steady stream of new products and cost-cutting measures, as well as higher prices, to lift profits. The company, whose products include Cheerios cereal and Progresso soup, has also benefited as consumers ate more meals at home to save money amid the recession, and as prices for commodities like wheat fell.
General Mills has been gaining market share in cereal, soup and other categories, with new products like high-fiber soups and a Yoplait frozen smoothie kit helping it stave off private-label competitors.
The company also has not raised prices in more than a year in 12 of its top 15 categories, Kendall J. Powell, its chief executive, said.
General Mills on Wednesday said profit rose to $420.6 million, or $1.25 a share, in the first quarter, ended Aug. 30, from $278.5 million, or 79 cents a share, a year earlier.
Excluding changes in the market value of commodity hedges the company holds, earnings were $1.28 a share. Wall Street analysts had forecast $1.03, according to Reuters Estimates.
Sales rose less than 1 percent, to $3.52 billion, compared with a 14 percent increase a year ago. The stronger dollar, which lessens the dollar value of sales outside the United States, cut 2 percentage points from sales.
Retail sales in the United States rose 6 percent, to $2.42 billion, helped by a 9 percent increase in sales of its Big G cereals, which include Cheerios, Fiber One, Trix and other brands.
The company said it now expected full-year earnings of $4.40 to $4.45 a share, excluding one-time items, an increase from a previous forecast of $4.20 to $4.25. Analysts on average forecast $4.27, according to Reuters Estimates.
While commodity costs were down in the quarter, General Mills said it still expected low-single-digit inflation for the year. It also said it planned to use some of the earnings increase on more marketing.
Shares of General Mills rose $2.83, or 4.6 percent, to $63.80.

Full text: Two authoritative surveys in recent days have underscored why all Americans have a stake in successful health care reform. Too many people are being hit with relentlessly rising premiums or are at serious risk of losing their coverage to allow the status quo to continue.
A survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that, once again, health insurance premiums rose faster last year than either wages or general inflation. A study by the Treasury Department found that almost half of all Americans below Medicare age have gone without insurance at some point over the last decade.
The Kaiser study, conducted jointly with the Health Research and Education Trust, an affiliate of the American Hospital Association, found that the average premium for a family policy offered at work rose above $13,300 in 2009 -- up from $5,800 in 1999. The average employer paid more than $9,800 of that, while the workers contributed more than $3,500. The workers were also hit with larger co-payments and deductibles, while their policies often offered fewer benefits.
The premium increase this year was a relatively modest 5 percent, far below the 13 percent rate in two previous years. But that still far outpaced a 3.1 percent growth in wages and a small decrease in inflation. Absent meaningful reform, worse is sure to come.
Kaiser estimates that, if increases revert to the average of the last 10 years, health insurance premiums in 2019 will average a whopping $30,800, which it calls "a very scary number." More immediately, a fifth of the employers surveyed said they are very likely to increase the amount that employees pay for premiums next year.
Meanwhile, the Treasury Department's study highlighted how vulnerable Americans are to losing their coverage.
It found that, between 1997 and 2006, 48 percent of nonelderly Americans went without health insurance for at least one month, 41 percent lacked coverage for at least six months and 36 percent were uncovered for a year or more. That happened during a decade of strong economic growth. The number of uninsured is likely to be higher over the next decade, the study warns.
The argument for reform seems clear. Americans without insurance need guaranteed access to coverage. Those with insurance need a guarantee that they will not be dropped by their insurers and will be able to buy an affordable policy if their employers decide to drop coverage. And ways must be found to slow the rise in health care costs and ease the burden of paying for insurance.

Abstract: Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the senior Republican on the Finance Committee, said the White House and Democratic leaders had short-circuited bipartisan talks by imposing a mid-September deadline on negotiations by a group of three Democrats and three Republicans. Under the proposal, it would be easier than in his original bill for people with access to insurance through their employers to obtain tax credits to help them buy coverage on their own, in new state-based exchanges.

Full text: As the Senate Finance Committee took up legislation, Democrats expressed confidence Tuesday that their effort to remake the nation's health care system was gaining momentum. But Republicans sharpened their attacks on a requirement that most Americans carry insurance, a central element of the bill.
"This is our opportunity to make history," said the committee chairman, Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, as the panel began its long-awaited work on his measure.
The rising optimism among Democrats came as the Massachusetts Senate, on the heels of a similar vote in the Massachusetts House, approved a bill allowing Gov. Deval Patrick to appoint a temporary successor to the late Senator Edward M. Kennedy. The Democratic governor's appointee could supply a crucial 60th vote allowing Senate Democrats to overcome any Republican filibuster on health care.
In an effort to round up additional votes for his mammoth bill, Mr. Baucus made further changes to it Tuesday, in part to make insurance more affordable for low- and middle-income people.
Longtime senators of both parties said the bill was the most ambitious project they had ever worked on. Opening remarks at the committee's session indicated a hardening of opposition among Republicans, with the notable exception of Senator Olympia J. Snowe of Maine, who has been at the center of negotiations over the bill.
Several Republicans said Democrats were trying to jam through a measure that would restructure one-sixth of the nation's economy. And they predicted an angry public revolt if Democrats rushed the bill through Congress by using a procedural device to limit debate.
"You think the American people were upset in August?" said the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. "You haven't seen anything like they're going to be if this device is chosen."
Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the senior Republican on the Finance Committee, said the White House and Democratic leaders had short-circuited bipartisan talks by imposing a mid-September deadline on negotiations by a group of three Democrats and three Republicans.
"The cry of impatience has won out, and the artificial deadline was put in charge of this process," Mr. Grassley said. "They have put moving quickly over moving correctly."
Mr. Grassley said the requirement that people carry insurance was an unwarranted "intrusion into private lives." And he maintained that it had originated with insurance companies, which, he said, stand to benefit.
"For them," Mr. Grassley said, "a requirement that everyone buy their product sounds like a great idea. But to the rest of us, it might seem just a little bit self-serving."
The Senate's No. 2 Republican, Jon Kyl of Arizona, described the bill as "a stunning assault on liberty, mandating that everyone buy a certain type of insurance mandated by Washington."
The Senate Democratic leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, said at a news conference that Mr. Baucus's efforts over the last year had built broad support for the legislation among Democrats. He expressed confidence that a major health care bill would be approved by the full Senate in coming weeks.
Changes announced Tuesday by Mr. Baucus respond to concerns expressed by members of both parties. The changes would tighten regulation of insurance companies, expand consumer protections and increase subsidies to help people buy insurance.
Mr. Baucus tried to address the biggest concern of fellow Democrats by proposing the more generous subsidies, to be given in the form of tax credits. Under his original plan, people with income at the federal poverty level ($22,050 for a family of four) would have been expected to spend 3 percent of their income on premiums, while people with incomes of 300 percent to 400 percent of the poverty level would have been expected to spend 13 percent of their income.
Under his new proposal, premium contributions would range from 2 percent to 12 percent.
In addition, Mr. Baucus would cut the maximum penalty for people who do not have insurance, to $1,900 a year for a family, from $3,800 in his original proposal. The penalty would be an excise tax, collected by the Internal Revenue Service, and the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation said it would hit some people with annual incomes of less than $200,000.
One of Mr. Baucus's changes Tuesday could profoundly alter the insurance market, now dominated by employer-sponsored plans. Under the proposal, it would be easier than in his original bill for people with access to insurance through their employers to obtain tax credits to help them buy coverage on their own, in new state-based exchanges.
Mr. Baucus would still impose a tax on high-cost health plans, generally those with premiums exceeding $8,000 for individuals and $21,000 for families, starting in 2013. But he would increase the thresholds for plans covering retirees over the age of 55 and for those covering people in certain high-risk occupations, like law enforcement, firefighting, construction and mining. The threshold for such plans would be raised by $750 for individual coverage and $2,000 for family coverage.
Mr. Baucus would also make it more difficult for people to take tax deductions for medical expenses. Under current law, taxpayers can take an itemized deduction for unreimbursed medical expenses, to the extent they exceed 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income. Mr. Baucus would raise the threshold to 10 percent.
To address another concern, he would allow some older Americans to keep extra benefits they receive from private insurance plans known as Medicare Advantage plans. The proposal would help beneficiaries in a limited number of high-cost areas, including some in Florida and New York.
Mr. Baucus would partly offset the cost of this provision by imposing higher fees on insurance companies, in addition to the excise tax on high-cost policies. The fees would total $6.7 billion a year, instead of the $6 billion he originally proposed.
Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said it was clear that Democrats were prepared to make the compromises needed to pass a bill. "There is going to be a herculean effort to get this done, even if every member doesn't get everything he or she wants," Mr. Schumer said.
Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, said, "We are going to have it to the president, and he is going to sign it, before Christmas."
While deflecting criticism from the left and the right, Mr. Baucus acknowledged that he was disappointed with one element of his own bill. It does not do enough to protect doctors from cuts in their Medicare fees, he said.
Under current law, doctors face cuts of 21.5 percent in 2010 and 5.5 percent a year from 2011 to 2014. Mr. Baucus's bill would give doctors one year of relief, increasing their Medicare fees by 0.5 percent in 2010. The cost to the government would be $11 billion in 2010-11.
A companion bill in the House would provide annual inflation adjustments in Medicare payments to doctors, at a higher projected cost: $228 billion over 10 years.

Full text: The stock market's rally goes on.
After a day of losses, stocks rebounded on Tuesday as top officials of the Federal Reserve held a two-day meeting to discuss interest rates, inflation and the economy. With big banks and industrial companies taking the lead, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 51.01 points, or 0.5 percent, to close at 9,829.87. JPMorgan Chase and Caterpillar were the biggest gainers in the Dow's index of 30 blue-chip stocks.
The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 7 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,071.66, while the Nasdaq composite index picked up 8.26 points, or 0.4 percent, to end at 2,146.30.
Meanwhile, the value of the dollar slipped again against a half-dozen major world currencies, hitting its lowest level in a year against the euro, at $1.479.
Investors who fled to the relative safety of the dollar during last year's financial crisis are now streaming away from the currency for a variety of reasons, pushing its value lower. Some are seeking higher returns in other currencies and different investments. Others worry that emergency financial interventions by the government and the Fed have laid the groundwork for higher inflation in the future.
Despite worries that foreign governments -- China above all others -- are losing their appetite for American debt and dollars just as the United States is racking up huge new deficits, analysts said that overseas dollar holdings remained strong. This June, 36.4 percent of China's reserves were Treasuries, up from 29.6 percent last year, said Marc Chandler, global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman.
"The dollar's weakness is cyclical," said Mr. Chandler, who expects the dollar to rebound when the Fed eventually raises interest rates. "The dollar will begin finding more traction, assuming that growth in the U.S. is going to be stronger than most people expect."
More optimistic analysts say they are encouraged by the responses to Wall Street's down days. The S.& P. 500 has closed lower five times, and four of those trading sessions were followed by gains, showing that investors are buying into the market when it dips.
Some are bracing for a correction, but so far, the recent rally has kept chugging on, carrying the Dow to within striking distance of 10,000 points -- a threshold the index last saw in October.
"Could we pull back?" said Ryan Detrick, a strategist at Schaeffer's Investment Research. "Yes. But we don't think there's any way we could crash."
Shares of Macy's rose 5.5 percent on Tuesday after Citigroup analysts upgraded the department store chain to buy and raised their price targets. Other shares of retailers like Dillard's, J. C. Penney and Saks rose, though less so.
As financial firms and oil companies climbed higher in the stock market, the prices of gold and crude oil surged back after dipping one day earlier. Recently, the value of the dollar and prices of commodities have jagged in different directions, as investors use oil or gold as defensive bets against inflation.
But the Fed's outlook on inflation is still muted, even though crude oil prices have more than doubled since their lows of $33 a barrel this winter, rising to $71.55 a barrel on Tuesday, up $1.84 for the day, and the costs of gasoline, plane tickets, health care and other consumer items are rising.
At its meeting this week, the Fed is widely expected to leave its target short-term interest rate at a record low of nearly zero. But investors are looking for some guidance about whether the central bank will begin scaling back any more of its emergency financing programs. This summer, the Fed's Open Market Committee announced that it would wind down a program to buy $300 billion in Treasury securities this October.
The Treasury's 10-year note rose 10/32, to 101 16/32. The yield fell to 3.44 percent, from 3.48 percent late Monday.
Following are the results of Tuesday's Treasury auction of four-week bills, 52-week bills and two-year notes:

A System Breeding More Waste

Abstract: On one side are those conservatives and doctors who have no doubt that frivolous lawsuits and Democratic politicians beholden to trial lawyers are the reasons American health care is so expensive.

Full text: The debate over medical malpractice can often seem theological. On one side are those conservatives and doctors who have no doubt that frivolous lawsuits and Democratic politicians beholden to trial lawyers are the reasons American health care is so expensive. On the other side are those liberals who see malpractice reform as another Republican conspiracy to shift attention from the real problem.
Yet most people, I suspect, still aren't sure exactly what to think. For them, the good news is that the issue has inspired a lot of research by economists and others with no vested interest. And after sifting through years of data, these researchers have come to some basic factual conclusions.
The findings are especially useful now that President Obama is promising to finance malpractice reform pilot projects, and Republicans are urging him to go further. Here, then, is the brief version of the facts:
The direct costs of malpractice lawsuits -- jury awards, settlements and the like -- are such a minuscule part of health spending that they barely merit discussion, economists say. But that doesn't mean the malpractice system is working.
The fear of lawsuits among doctors does seem to lead to a noticeable amount of wasteful treatment. Amitabh Chandra -- a Harvard economist whose research is cited by both the American Medical Associationand the trial lawyers' association -- says $60 billion a year, or about 3 percent of overall medical spending, is a reasonable upper-end estimate. If a new policy could eliminate close to that much waste without causing other problems, it would be a no-brainer.
At the same time, though, the current system appears to treat actual malpractice too lightly. Trials may get a lot of attention, but they are the exception. Far more common are errors that never lead to any action.
After reviewing thousands of patient records, medical researchers haveestimated that only 2 to 3 percent of cases of medical negligence lead to a malpractice claim. For every notorious error -- the teenager who died in North Carolina after being given the wrong blood type, the 39-year-old Massachusetts mother killed by a chemotherapy overdose, the newborn twins (children of the actor Dennis Quaid) given too much blood thinner -- there are dozens more. You never hear about these other cases.
So we have a malpractice system that, while not as bad as some critics suggest, is expensive in all the wrong ways.
Medical errors happen more frequently here than in other rich countries, as the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation recently found. Only a tiny share of victims receive compensation. Among those who do, the awards vary from the lavish to the minimal. And even though the system treats most victims poorly, notes Michelle Mello of the School of Public Health at Harvard, "the uncertainty leads to defensive behavior by physicians that generates more costs for everyone."
Something else that's expensive in all the wrong ways, of course, is the rest of the health care system. That's no coincidence.

If you talk to doctors about malpractice, you come to realize that the root of their objections isn't financial. Yes, the money matters, and, yes, there are horror stories about $200,000 premiums for malpractice insurance. But most premiums are nowhere near that high.
All told, jury awards, settlements and administrative costs -- which, by definition, are similar to the combined cost of insurance -- add up to less than $10 billion a year. This equals less than one-half of a percentage point of medical spending. There have been years when malpractice payouts rose sharply, but there have also been years when they did not. Over the last two decades, the amount has increased roughly in line with total medical spending, according to a study in the journal Health Affairs, based on a national database.
This being said, the malpractice system does affect the morale of doctors. It leaves them wondering when they will be publicly accused of doing the very thing they've sworn not to do: harm patients. Dr. S. Anthony Wolfe, the chief of plastic surgery at Miami Children's Hospital, told me he had been to court three times in the last 34 years and won all three times. "But it was a Pyrrhic victory," he said. He spent weeks in court, enduring "rude, demeaning and endless depositions and badgering."
You can understand why such experiences would lead doctors to order extra tests and treatments.
Perhaps the best-known study of defensive medicine -- by Dr. Mark McClellan, who later ran Medicare in the Bush administration, and Daniel Kessler -- compared cardiology treatment in states that had capped malpractice awards in the 1980s and early '90s with those that didn't. In the states without caps, stenting and other treatments were more common, but the outcomes were no better.
Later research -- into various surgical operations, for instance -- has found less of evidence of defensive medicine. But Mr. Chandra points out that this later work (including some of his own) is not as elegant as the cardiology paper. States have not made as many changes to malpractice law in recent years, which makes research tricky. That's why Mr. Chandra's estimate of the cost of defensive medicine, up to $60 billion a year, stems largely from the cardiology work.
Obviously, the precise amount of defensive medicine can never be known. Anyone who sets out to find a certain answer will be able to cite one study or another. (One good example of ideology dressed up as economics: the American Medical Association does not adjust for inflation when claiming that malpractice costs are soaring.)
Still, the researchers in the field tend to agree about the scale of the problem -- and how much malpractice reform might accomplish.
Dr. McClellan puts it this way: "By itself, it's not comprehensive solution. I do think it's an important element." Katherine Baicker, another economist who served in the Bush administration, says, "reforming the malpractice system wouldn't be a bad thing, but it wouldn't solve the crisis of mounting health costs." Dana Goldman, director of the Schaeffer Center for Health Policy at the University of Southern California, adds: "It is one of the things we need to address if we want to bend the cost curve. But it's not going to solve the problem."
The problem is that just about every incentive in our medical system is to do more. Most patients have no idea how much their care costs. Doctors are generally paid more when they do more. And, indeed, extra tests and procedures can help protect them from lawsuits.
So the most promising fixes are the ones that don't treat the malpractice system as an isolated issue.
Imagine if the government paid for more research into which treatments really do make people healthier -- a step many doctors don't like. Such evidence-based medicine could then get the benefit of the doubt in court. The research would also make it easier to set up "health courts," with expedited case schedules and expert judges, which many doctors advocate.
Similarly, you would want to see more serious efforts to reduce medical error and tougher discipline for doctors who made repeated errors -- in exchange for a less confrontational, less costly process for those doctors who, like all of us, sometimes make mistakes.
A grand compromise along these lines may be unlikely. But it's a lot more consistent with the evidence than narrower ideas. The goal, remember, isn't just to reduce malpractice lawsuits. It's also to reduce malpractice.

Abstract: The idea, proposed last Wednesday by Senator Max Baucus, is to help raise money for the nation's health care overhaul by placing a new excise tax on the most expensive health insurance policies, like the ones offered to partners at Goldman Sachs and other affluent professionals. People who live in high-cost areas, like the Northeast or California, would also have a greater risk that their insurance plans would set off the excise tax -- not because the coverage is particularly generous, but because the price of their policies reflects the higher medical costs where they live.

Full text: Although cast as a tax on gold-plated insurance policies for the well-heeled, it has prompted anxiety among the middle class.
The idea, proposed last Wednesday by Senator Max Baucus, is to help raise money for the nation's health care overhaul by placing a new excise tax on the most expensive health insurance policies, like the ones offered to partners at Goldman Sachs and other affluent professionals.
The tax is meant to raise more than a quarter of the $774 billion needed to pay for the Baucus plan. But just as much, the tax is intended to discourage the overly generous coverage that many experts say has helped propel the country's reckless spending on medical care.
As it turns out, though, many smaller fish would get caught in Mr. Baucus's tax net. The supposedly Cadillac insurance policies include ones that cover many of the nation's firefighters and coal miners, older employees at small businesses -- a whole gamut that runs from union shops to Main Street entrepreneurs.
Under the Baucus plan, insurers selling a plan costing more than $8,000 for an individual and $21,000 for a family would have to pay a 35 percent excise tax on the excess amount.
Although the national average premium is currently $13,375 for a family policy, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, many are much higher than that -- particularly in high-cost parts of the country.
Nationwide, about one in 10 family insurance plans would be subject to the new excise tax, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal-leaning policy and research group.
The tax would be levied on insurers -- or on employers that act as their own insurers. Either way, the tax would very likely be passed along to workers in even higher premiums than they pay now. But if insurance premiums continue to rise faster than inflation, as they have for years, many more people's policies could end up setting off the luxury tax in coming years.
"It puts a bigger tax on middle-income Americans who are already paying enough," said Harold A. Schaitberger, the general president of the International Association of Fire Fighters. The union says some of its members around the country are in plans that would be subject to the tax.
People who live in high-cost areas, like the Northeast or California, would also have a greater risk that their insurance plans would set off the excise tax -- not because the coverage is particularly generous, but because the price of their policies reflects the higher medical costs where they live. Massachusetts residents, for example, tend to pay more than a quarter more in premiums, on average, than people living in Idaho.
Bruce Hodson is a state employee in Maine and the president of Local 1989 of the Service Employees International Union, where the cost of a family plan is now running at about $20,500 a year. At the typical pace of health premium inflation, his policy could very likely set off the tax if it goes into effect in 2013, as the Baucus plan proposes.
The plan has a $400 annual deductible per family, and Mr. Hodson has a co-payment whenever he goes to the doctor.
"We really worked hard to keep the cost down," Mr. Hodson said of the union plan. And that coverage came at the expense of higher salaries, he said. "We've given up pay raises for this."
The tax proposal has also drawn fire from some of Mr. Baucus's Democratic colleagues, including John D. Rockefeller IV, who been an outspoken critic of the overall Baucus plan. Mr. Rockefeller says he is particularly worried about the effect of the tax on coverage for workers like coal miners, including those in his home state of West Virginia, and firefighters.
"I am concerned that the current excise tax proposal could prevent workers in high-risk professions from getting the health benefits they need," he said.
Mr. Baucus acknowledges some of the concerns and plans to work with the other members of the Finance Committee to address them, said Erin Shields, a spokeswoman for the senator. The proposal, she said, already sets the thresholds somewhat higher in those states where coverage is the most expensive.
But Ms. Shields defined the tax as vital to discouraging insurance coverage that is overly generous. "High-cost health plans are a major contributor to skyrocketing health care costs," she said. Employers, she said, would still be able to find meaningful coverage below the threshold.
On Sunday, President Obama said he saw the need to protect union members, but he also defended the tax. "I do think that giving a disincentive to insurance companies to offer Cadillac plans that don't make people healthier is part of the way that we're going to bring down health care costs for everybody over the long term."
Proponents say the tax is squarely aimed at the very richest plans -- like the family coverage offered to the 400 or so managing directors at Goldman Sachs and its top executive officers. It carries a premium of around $40,000 a year. The Goldman plan would be subject to nearly $7,000 in taxes. Goldman Sachs declined to comment.
Even if most employees around the nation might initially escape, experts say more people's insurance plans would cross into the taxable range in future years. If the inflation rate in premiums continues its pace of the last 10 years, even the average cost of family coverage would probably cross the threshold within a few years of the tax's going into effect.
"That number is going to grow and grow and grow," said Marissa Milton, a health care policy analyst for the HR Policy Association, which represents large employers' benefit managers.
Ms. Milton drew a comparison to the alternative minimum tax -- a tax modified in 1986, supposedly as a way to keep affluent people from using deductions to avoid paying taxes. In reality, it has ended up capturing more and more middle-class taxpayers, Ms. Milton said. Likewise, the insurance excise tax "is going to affect a lot of families," she said.
By his own calculation, Robert G. Hansen, a business professor at Dartmouth, is one of the Americans who might be considered to have luxurious coverage, because the cost of his benefits could easily top $25,000.
But that supposedly "gold-plated coverage," he said, includes the cost of related benefits, like dental coverage and the money in his flexible spending account -- all of which would be subject to the excise tax.
And who will pay the $1,450 in additional taxes Mr. Hansen would incur? "In the end, look in the mirror," he said.
"It's the worst kind of economic engineering," he said. "You end up with something that looks like the I.R.S. code."
Small employers would also probably be hit by the taxes -- and, again, not because they offer overly generous coverage. Instead, small businesses tend to pay more for their insurance than bigger employers that can negotiate better premiums. And because they do not have large pools of workers to help spread the risk, small employers tend to pay even higher amounts if they have older or sicker workers.
About 14 percent of small employers, counted as those with fewer than 500 workers, now offer policies that would be subject to the excise tax, said Beth Umland, director of research for Mercer, a consulting firm that conducts an annual survey of employee benefits. That compares with just 5 percent of large employers with 500 or more workers.
"That is a very heavy hammer on the cost of your premiums," said Donna Marshall, the executive director of theColorado Business Group on Health, which represents employers of all sizes in that state. "You don't want to cause a chilling effect on the employers who are trying to do the right thing."
Even union plans, which tend to offer the most generous coverage, are expensive because they frequently cover a number of older workers or some who retired early and have not yet reached Medicare age. Jim Hoffa, president of the Teamsters union, warned that the middle class, not the rich, would bear the brunt. "It taxes the wrong people."

Full text: THE stock market has been soaring. It may have gone too far, too fast.
Gina Martin Adams, an equity strategist at Wells Fargo Securities, certainly thinks so. "I would definitely tread very lightly in stocks," she said. At the moment, there appears to be enough momentum to keep propelling the rally forward until it "stumbles on some speed bumps," she said, but she warned that stocks were no longer cheap, especially with the financial system and the economy still fragile.
At some point, and probably fairly soon, she said, a host of fundamental problems would pull stocks back down to earth -- but, of course, she could not say when. "There's a difference between where the market will trade and where it should trade," she said.
Stocks have certainly come a long way since their March 9 lows, with the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rising 58 percent in one of the most powerful upturns since the Great Depression. The recent rally, of course, followed the steepest decline in decades. The index stands at 1,068.30, still well below its October 2007 peak of 1,565.15.
A rebound of some sort was likely after the battering inflicted on financial markets during last year's panic. In a speech on Wall Street last week, commemorating the anniversary of the collapse of Lehman Brothers, President Obama said the most acute phase of the financial crisis was behind us. But he cautioned that the economy remained weak with rising unemployment, and that a variety of emergency government programs would continue to play a significant role in keeping the economy afloat. And Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, warned in remarks in Washington that while the United States was probably out of recession from a "technical perspective," the economy would still "feel" very weak for some time.
Despite this grim backdrop, Laszlo Birinyi, president of Birinyi Associates, a stock market research firm in Westport, Conn., believes that we are in the early stages of a classic bull market that has plenty of room to run.
"At any juncture during a bull market over the last 50 years you could point to economic problems," he said. "The obvious problems aren't the ones that I worry about." In his view, the economic weakness has been documented so well that the market has already taken it into account. "The negatives are right in front of your nose," he said. "The market is looking past it."
Unless there is another shock of some unknown kind, he said, "I don't think we'll have a correction, not at this point of the cycle. It won't happen while everyone's looking for it." In fact, he said he was encouraged that "there's continuing concern" -- including articles cautioning that the market would stumble.
"Almost no one seems to accept and use the term 'bull market' " for the current rally, Mr. Birinyi said. That implies there is plenty of cash still on the sidelines that will enter the market as it rises, he said, pushing stocks up even further.
Where Mr. Birinyi emphasizes opportunities, however, others are focusing on the dangers. David A. Rosenberg, the former Merrill Lynch economist who is now with Gluskin Sheff and Associates in Toronto, did not expect so robust of a rally, and said that underlying structural weaknesses in the economy implied that the market was due for a big fall.
"What happened was that the economy received a heavy dose of medication from Uncle Sam," he said. "The reality is that no one has a clue as to what the economy really looks like because it's been so dramatically sedated by the federal government.
"It's as though we've received a massive tranquilizer," he said, "but eventually, tranquilizers wear off."
Mr. Rosenberg said we were experiencing "an impressive bear-market rally" -- a short-term upturn in a "secular" bear market -- that still had perhaps eight or nine years to run. He advised stock investors to take profits now. Energy commodities, he said, appeared to be a better value.
Mrs. Adams shares this bearish long-term view, even if she believes the market may continue to move upward for a while. Among the many worrisome signs she sees are Treasury yields that remain low, especially considering the enormous supply of bonds the government is auctioning regularly to finance its yawning deficit. This suggests that deflation continues to be a big worry, she said. If we lurch into deflation -- a downward price spiral -- it could devastate the economy and the markets.
Gold has prospered recently -- it stands at about $1,007 an ounce -- partly because investors cherish it as a hedge against both inflation and deflation, said George Milling-Stanley, a managing director at the World Gold Council, an industry trade group based in London. "One of the beauties of gold," he said, "is that it just doesn't have any statistical correlation with any other market or asset class." There is one possible exception, he said: "When the world's main reserve currency -- now, the dollar -- weakens, gold tends to strengthen." Because the consensus in currency markets is that federal borrowing will weaken the dollar, this, too, has tended to benefit gold.
THE Federal Reserve is steering a tricky course, attempting to stave off deflation by creating enormous quantities of money and holding its benchmark short-term rate near zero. At the same time, Fed policy makers say they are preparing to reverse themselves to head off inflation.
Will they manage a "Goldilocks" strategy, just loose enough to keep the economy growing and nimble enough to head off inflation? Watch the 10-year Treasury yield closely, Mrs. Adams said. It's now 3.47 percent. If it stays low, she says, it could be a sign that the economy and stock market are in real trouble.
In the meantime, enjoy the rally.

Full text: SOMEONE with $100 million has nothing to fear, not even fear itself.
But not long ago, a client with such assets called and asked Bruce Bickel, her wealth adviser at PNC Wealth Management, to put her on a budget.
"She said we've never done this before, and we think we should," said Mr. Bickel, managing director of private foundation management services at PNC. "It's all relative. Their loss has put them in a fear response."
That mindset is a direct result of the financial panic that turned one year old this week. At this time last year, Richard Fuld was center stage in the financial crisis; Ken Lewis, chief executive of Bank of America, was being hailed as Merrill Lynch's savior; and Bernard L. Madoff was little known beyond the financial world.
None of that is true today. And even though a year has passed, wealthy investors remain cautious.
The Boston Consulting Group predicted this week that worldwide wealth would not return to 2007 precrisis levels until 2013. It also said it found that the number of millionaires was down 18 percent and that, across the board, clients of wealth management firms had lost trust in their advisers.
"There is a shattered confidence we haven't seen in a long time," said Bruce Holley, senior partner at the firm. "The wealth management business is a very emotional business, and people can react in kind to that."
This explains how someone with more than $100 million in assets can ask her adviser to put her on a budget. As far-fetched as it may sound to someone struggling to make a mortgage payment, such a request reflects the changes in attitudes about wealth in the last year.
SHOW ME THE MONEY Watching where your money goes is more than just having a budget. "One of my families said, 'If you're worried about spending, then you're not wealthy,' " Mr. Bickel said. "But across the board, there is greater discernment with use of discretionary income."
That discernment has taken many forms. One is charity. Many of the two dozen private foundations Mr. Bickel advises have become more focused in their giving. In one case, the family used to give to various cancer-related charities, but it now concentrates on cancer research. The family has not reduced what it gives, just focused it on a particular area to have greater effect.
Still, any budgeting is bound to encompass personal expenses, even for those with plenty.
"People who would get a new Mercedes S550 every couple of years aren't doing it now," said G. Moffett Cochran, chief executive of Silvercrest Asset Management, which has an average account size of $30 million. "The next car may not be an S550; it may be an Acura. There's an awareness of conspicuous consumption."
This feeling is gaining ground. Mr. Bickel said he has been helping parents talk to children about cutting back and doing so without feeling guilty. "They say, 'My teenager isn't driving a BMW; she has to drive a Ford Focus,' " he said. "I tell them not to worry about it. The need is the car. The desire is the BMW."
In both cases, the car buyers could probably buy any car they wanted. But they are thinking more about what else they could do with that money. This caution, too, is reflected in their investing practices.
EASY DOES IT Even though stock markets have rebounded from their lows this year, wealthy investors have not rushed back in.
Nancy Rooney, head of the Northeast investment business for J.P. Morgan private wealth management, which serves clients with $1 million to $25 million, said she has seen two types of investors become cautious in their investing.
The first have new money and had not experienced serious market swings before. They had been focused on their quarterly gains and largely ignored the risks. Having lost a lot more money than they thought possible, they are struggling with the shock of it.
Or, as Mr. Cochran put it, "Many people thought they were gunslingers." Now, he said, "They're not gunslingers any more." Mr. Holley described the sentiment as a return to "meat and potatoes" investing.
Now, that group is focused more on the risk of an investment than its possible return. One result is they are poring through all the disclosures before investing, and they are not as worried about missing out if they are pressured to invest too quickly.
The second group is older and held wealth longer. They exhibited almost a knee-jerk reaction to the crisis and put a lot of money into cash early on. They continued to stand on the sidelines through the initial rebound. Only now are they looking to invest in safe assets, like prerefunded bonds secured by United States government obligations.
"We are very gradually working with them," Ms. Rooney said. "For many of them, it was a loss of confidence in themselves as well as in the markets."
Mr. Cochran said he believed many clients thought the world was coming to an end last September. That it did not end has not consoled them. They are still hesitant with new investments.
One reason is that many do not want to tie up their assets and then not have access when and if they need money. No one wants to have to sell a good asset at a bad price to cover living costs. The problem, though, is that cash or money market funds will not keep pace with inflation. So they will have to dip into the principal of their portfolio.
One longtime real estate investor Ms. Rooney spoke to said he understood the ebb and flow of investment returns but was still spooked by what happened last fall. "The inability to access all of his funds immediately sent a panic though him that he hadn't focused on before," she said.
This means, for now at least, that even savvy investors are willing to pass on investing with a top manager if they feel their money would be locked up too long.
"Even when the markets rebound, we don't expect people to get in with the same speed as before to the high-yielding assets," said Monish Kumar, global leader of asset and wealth management at Boston Consulting.
THE FUTURE Caution, like thrift, can be detrimental to an economy in crisis. If wealthy investors steer clear of stocks for the medium term, the trading rally of the last few months could slow. If they are afraid to lock up their capital for the longer term, private equity partnerships and hedge funds could suffer. And if wealthier people eschew the heavy debt load they had recently embraced, their savings may increase but the banks that had eagerly lent to them will feel the effect. And this will then affect less-affluent investors.
Yet these are all ifs born of a mild recovery. Last year at this time, few advisers would have predicted that the economy would have come back this far this soon.
"Many of our clients are very happy to be sitting on bond portfolios and cash reserves," Mr. Cochran said. "What I can't answer is whether that money is permanently on the sidelines."
Regardless, a budget isn't a bad idea.

Full text: Exuberance Defies
Sober New Reality
Is irrational exuberance back in the markets? Evidence abounds that it may be. With financial chaos abating, the return of risk appetite in stock and lending markets is logical -- up to a point. But risk-taking that aspires to the boom-time norm, rather than a more sober new reality, could be premature and dangerous.
True, it's important not to get stuck in a crisis mentality. Markets probably fell too much, and some level of recovery is therefore only a return to a sensible middle ground. For instance, the risk premiums over Treasury yields on junk bonds, now roughly 8 percentage points, are more or less back to where they were before Lehman Brothers went bust. They are still much larger than their 2007 bull market levels below 3 percentage points, and well above the long-term average, which lies somewhere in between.
The Chicago Board Options Exchange VIX index of United States stock market volatility, also seen as a gauge of investor fear, is in the same category. It spiked sharply after the Lehman collapse and has subsided, but it is nowhere near its lows.
So far, so good. But there are clear signs of an overshoot on the upside, a so-called echo bubble, along the lines already seen in Chinese stocks. Sensible analysis of stock prices, for instance, suggests that after the run-up of recent months, little in the way of crisis aftershocks is priced in, and some see markets as overvalued.
A recent rash of bond issues and planned stock offerings can be viewed as a return to business as usual. But some also look overly opportunistic. When Blockbuster, until recently widely seen as an anachronistic video-rental business condemned to permanent decline by the digital revolution, can pull enough demand to double the size of a debt offering to $675 million, as it did on Wednesday, it raises the question of whether investors are looking for an early return of bull market conditions.
Similarly, Kodak, another company struggling with a secular decline of its core business, was able to raise up to $700 million from a sale of securities to investors led by the buyout house Kohlberg Kravis Roberts. AMR, the parent of American Airlines, sold air miles and tweaked its aircraft financing to gain access to nearly $3 billion of extra funds, a move that sent its share price soaring by about 20 percent.
There is also anecdotal evidence that banks are willing to fund leveraged buyouts again, and that the terms under consideration have become rapidly more aggressive in recent weeks.
The ramping-up of prices for commodities like oil and gold also suggests a return of speculative activity, although gold may also be in favor as a hedge against possible inflation. Either way, though, it's hard to escape the feeling that all the cheap government money still sloshing around, and that keeping short-term interest rates down is more likely than not to stoke a new bubble.
Investors are also "tired of talking about the macro issues," according to Tobias Levkovich, Citigroup's chief equity strategist. That's perhaps no bad thing given the return of some stability to markets. It makes sense, for instance, to distinguish between the investment potential of different companies rather than indiscriminately tarring all their stocks and bonds with the same brush.
Yet the things that keep people awake at night should still be the big macro concerns. Is the American consumer going to pull back further? Is a continuing downturn in commercial property going to undermine the credit recovery? Are bad things still lurking in the banking system? And with governments critical to market confidence, will they tackle challenges in monetary policy, tax, regulation and trade without making mistakes big enough to upset the apple cart?
Warren E. Buffett said this week that a lot has to go right for Kraft Foods to justify the price it has already put on the table for Cadbury. Yet if the British confectioner's share price is anything to go by, investors seem to expect a significantly higher offer to be forthcoming. That is today's markets in a nutshell.
The foundations of a recovery are scarcely in place and the optimists are already looking for the elevator to the new skyscraper's observation deck. They'll be lucky if they don't trip on some rubble while they wait. RICHARD BEALES

Full text: The rising cost of gasoline pushed overall consumer prices higher in August even as prices for most other goods and services remained in check, the government reported on Wednesday.
The Labor Department's Consumer Price Index rose 0.4 percent last month after hovering unchanged in July, a sign that inflation was gradually edging back into the economy, though not nearly as fast as some investors have predicted. Prices for housing, food and recreation were up slightly, and prices for new cars and clothing fell from a month earlier.
Prices of all other items except food and energy -- the so-called core rate of inflation -- rose only 0.1 percent in August, suggesting that most costs of living were not following the upward arc of oil and gasoline prices.
Over all, core prices were 1.4 percent higher than last August. Health care costs, now the focus of intense debate in Washington, rose for another month, and are among the few areas of consumer spending that did not dip even for one month as the economy tumbled into recession. Medical costs crept up by a seasonally adjusted 0.3 percent in August, and were 3.3 percent higher than a year earlier.
Energy prices rose 4.6 percent last month, even though they were nearly one-fourth lower than the same period a year ago, when oil prices began to tumble from their record highs of around $145 a barrel.
Some investors are making big bets that heavy government spending and a nascent rebound in the economy will touch off another round of inflation, pushing commodity prices sharply higher and further eroding the value of the dollar. These inflation hawks have helped push the price of gold above $1,000 recently, and they point to rising oil and commodities prices as a harbinger.
Economists said consumer prices would have risen further in August if not for a 1.3 percent decline in prices of new vehicles, which occurred because of rebates from the government's cash-for-clunkers program. The drop in new-car prices was partly offset by a 1.9 percent rise in used car and truck prices.
The Federal Reserve still expects inflation to remain in check this year as the United States climbs out of a deep recession. Unemployment is still high, consumer demand for credit and goods and services is still subdued, and there is enormous slack in the economy.
But slowly, that excess is fading. The Federal Reserve noted on Wednesday that mines, utilities and manufacturing businesses ran slightly closer to capacity in August. That bolstered hopes that new orders and an upswing in business were prompting factories to speed up their assembly lines, add shifts and increase output. The percentage of capacity used rose to 69.6 last month, from 69 percent in July.
And industrial output increased for a second month, rising 0.8 percent after an increase of 1 percent in July. Production of consumer goods, business equipment and materials rose. If prices keep rising as the economy gets back on its feet, the Fed could face increasing pressure to raise interest rates as a check on inflation -- a tricky decision for policy makers struggling not to derail any fragile recovery.
"Providing low interest rates to the economy is like spiking the punch at a party," said Michael R. Englund, chief economist at Action Economics. "There tends not to be a move to unspike the punch."
In another report on Wednesday, the Commerce Department said that the deficit in the current account, the broadest measure of foreign trade, dropped to $98.8 billion in the second quarter. The amount represented 2.8 percent of the total economy as measured by the gross domestic product.

Abstract: Investors anticipating a resurgence in industrial output snapped up crude oil, copper and other raw materials used to feed factories.

Full text: Stock markets stampeded higher on Wednesday, and major Wall Street benchmarks touched their highest levels of the year on optimism that an economic rebound was under way.
Investors anticipating a resurgence in industrial output snapped up crude oil, copper and other raw materials used to feed factories. Those who expect inflation pushed the price of gold higher. And optimistic stock traders helped to send the Dow more than 100 points higher.
But a good day for stocks and commodities meant a rough ride for the dollar, whose value against six major currencies slipped to its lowest point since last September.
The dollar fell to $1.4723 against the euro, from $1.4659 a day earlier, and it weakened to 90.90 against the yen. Its recent decline could help American manufacturers by making their products cheaper overseas, but it underscores worries about big deficits and a swelling money supply in the United States.
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 108.30 points, or 1.1 percent, to close at 9,791.71, and the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 1.5 percent, or 16.13 points, at 1,068.76, reaching its highest level since early October. The Nasdaq rose 1.5 percent, or 30.51 points, to 2,133.15.
"We've been riding this thing for a long time," said Bill Strazzullo, chief market strategist at Bell Curve Trading. "You notice that the sell-offs never last more than a couple days. We're going to stay with it. We still think there's a little bit more to go."
Mr. Strazzullo said his firm was looking for benchmarks of 1,100 and 1,150 on the S.& P. 500 (it is now trading around 1,060) as moments to pause, take some profits and reassess whether the markets seem primed for more gains.
It has been a good week for the bulls on Wall Street.
A new report on industrial production showed that factories, mines and utilities increased their output for a second month in August, a sign that a recovery was under way. On Tuesday, the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said that the recession was most likely over, though he warned of a plodding recovery.
"You're getting more evidence that the economy's turning," said Anthony Dwyer, equity market strategist at FTN Equity Capital Markets. "This is going to be a big recovery because it was a big decline."
Financial shares, like those of credit card companies and regional banks, led the buying spree in stock markets.
Shares of Bank of America rose 2.7 percent while JPMorgan Chase rose 3.4 percent, and a closely watched index of regional bank shares was up 5.9 percent.
The aluminum maker Alcoa gained 3.4 percent and United States Steel was up 1.7 percent, reflecting hopes for a rebound driven by industry.
As stocks surged, Wall Street's gold rush intensified.
The price of gold rose $9.75 to settle at $1,017.30 an ounce as traders bet that prices of precious metals would continue to climb as the dollar weakened and the economy healed.
Investors rushed to buy crude oil, copper and other commodities that could weather an outbreak of inflation.
Some investors say they believe that inflation -- or at least the fear of inflation -- is seeping back into the economy as factories restart production and industrial output rebounds. The government reported Wednesday that retail prices rose 0.4 percent last month, largely because of a rise in gasoline costs.
Even though the Federal Reserve expects inflation to remain under wraps with so much slack in the economy and millions of people out of work, investors anticipating a surge in prices and a weaker dollar are betting heavily on commodities and other currencies.
Despite the surge in stock and commodities prices, Treasury prices fell only marginally. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 4/32, to 101 9/32, and the yield rose to 3.47 percent, from 3.45 percent late Tuesday.

Abstract: In a recent update of their groundbreaking series on income trends, the economists Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez found that from 2002 to 2007, the top 1 percent of households -- those making more than $400,000 a year -- received two-thirds of the nation's total income gains, their largest share of the spoils since the 1920s. Because many if not most Americans gained little to nothing from the Bush "growth" years, they have found themselves especially vulnerable to the recession.

Full text: It is sadly predictable that in a recession, the poor get poorer and the middle class loses ground. But even a downturn as deep and prolonged as this one cannot fully account for the desperate straits of so many Americans.
The Census Bureau reported last week that the nation's poverty rate rose to 13.2 percent in 2008, the highest level since 1997 and a significant increase from 12.5 percent in 2007. That means that some 40 million people in this country are living below the poverty line, defined as an income of $22,205 for a family of four.
The middle class also took a major hit. Median household income fell in 2008 to $50,300 from $52,200 in 2007. That is the steepest year-to-year drop since the government began keeping track four decades ago; adjusted for inflation, median income was lower in 2008 than in 1998 and every year since then.
Clearly, the recession has been brutal. But even before the recession, far too many Americans were already living far too close to the edge.
As is now painfully evident, the economic growth of the Bush era was largely an illusion. Poverty worsened during most of the boom years and middle-class pay stagnated, as most gains flowed to the top. In a recent update of their groundbreaking series on income trends, the economists Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez found that from 2002 to 2007, the top 1 percent of households -- those making more than $400,000 a year -- received two-thirds of the nation's total income gains, their largest share of the spoils since the 1920s.
Because many if not most Americans gained little to nothing from the Bush "growth" years, they have found themselves especially vulnerable to the recession.
Federal stimulus spending has helped cushion the blow. The question going forward is whether an economic recovery, when it comes, will help the poor and middle class or whether the top-heavy favoritism of the previous expansion will reassert itself.
The answer depends on how policy makers foster and manage a recovery. Economic growth alone does not guarantee job growth. Congress and the Obama administration must extend certain components of the stimulus package until employment does revive, including unemployment benefits, food stamps, tax breaks for working families with children and fiscal aid to states.
Policy makers must also resist the reassuring but false notion that renewed economic growth can, by itself, raise living standards broadly. Government policies are needed to ensure that growth is shared. Reforming health care so that illness is not bankrupting -- for families or for the federal budget -- would be a major step in the right direction.
The administration has also said that it would let the Bush-era tax cuts for the rich expire as scheduled at the end of 2010. More progressive taxation needs to be accompanied by more progressive spending, on public education and on job training and job creation. Support for unions and enforcement of labor standards would also help to ensure that in the next economic expansion, a fair share of profits would find its way into wages.
As the Bush era showed, the economy can grow without any of that happening. But it also showed that such growth is neither defensible nor sustainable. With half the population falling behind or struggling to keep up, the economy cannot generate secure and adequate spending, investing or upward mobility for the country to truly prosper.

Full text: Members of a key House committee said Tuesday that they were reluctant to change NASA's current plans for human spaceflight after the space shuttles are retired from service, beyond giving more money to the agency.
"I think that good public policy argues for setting the bar pretty high against making significant changes in direction at this point," said Representative Bart Gordon, Democrat of Tennessee, who is chairman of the Committee on Science and Technology. "There would need to be a compelling reason to scrap what we've invested our time and money in over these past four years."
Mr. Gordon's remarks came during the first Congressional hearing on a new report that offers options for the future of astronauts in space.
NASA is developing a new series of rockets to replace the space shuttles, which are scheduled to be retired next year.
The Obama administration has not offered public support for the rockets, which are part of the agency's Constellation program, and in May convened a panel to review the program.
Norman Augustine, a former chief executive of Lockheed Martin who led the 10-member review panel, encountered a sometimes testy atmosphere in his appearance before the committee on Tuesday.
"I am pretty angry," said Gabrielle Giffords, Democrat of Arizona, who heads the committee's Space and Aeronautics Subcommittee.
Ms. Giffords said she had been hoping for a detailed evaluation of Constellation and recommendations for how to improve it. Instead, she said, the panel had provided a menu of potential replacements for the program.
"We have a glancing attention to Constellation, even mentioning it in past tense," she said.
But Mr. Augustine said the panel had done what had been requested -- provide a list of options, not a preferred recommendation -- and noted that the Constellation program was one of the five options offered.
"We believe the existing program is a fine program," he said.
The panel issued a 12-page summary last week, and Mr. Augustine said it would try to complete the report this month.
Committee members agreed with Mr. Augustine on a central conclusion of the panel: NASA needs about $3 billion more a year -- increasing the spending over the next decade on human spaceflight to $130 billion from $100 billion -- or it will not be able to accomplish the goals of Constellation or any alternative program.
Without an increase, Mr. Augustine said, NASA could continue to operate the International Space Station and develop some new technology, but it would not get out of Earth orbit for the foreseeable future. "It will be a program that will inspire very few people," he said.
A smaller increase of $1.5 billion a year was also insufficient, the panel concluded.
In addition, it said that none of the options appreciably shortens the gap between the retirement of the shuttles -- when the United States will rely on Russia for transportation to and from the International Space Station -- and the development of the Ares I.
The Ares, the first of the Constellation rockets, will not be ready for use until at least 2015, and the panel predicted that the schedule would slip to 2017.
Mr. Augustine, who spent two hours before the House committee, will be questioned by the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee on Wednesday.
Also testifying to the House committee on Tuesday were Michael D. Griffin, the former NASA administrator who stepped down in January with the change in administrations, and Joseph W. Dyer, a retired vice admiral who is chairman of the aerospace advisory panel at NASA.
Dr. Griffin agreed that the fundamental issue is money, pointing out that NASA's budget was cut 20 percent in 1994. In inflation-adjusted dollars, NASA's budget is lower than it was in 1993. "I think we're here today because we don't like how that experiment turned out," he said.
To cancel Ares I and rely on commercial companies to provide transportation to orbit, a suggestion made by the review panel, would be "risky in the extreme," Dr. Griffin said. "That day is not yet and is not soon."
Dr. Griffin also said that NASA had been much more careful in preparing its cost estimates for Constellation and that the review panel had not taken that into account.
Mr. Dyer said that the safety panel did not support extending operations of the space shuttle, another of the options offered by the review panel.
He also said that NASA had not held detailed conversations with commercial companies about what would be necessary to make their rockets sufficiently safe for passengers.

Full text: For weeks, many of Wall Street's hopeful voices have been calling the end of the recession. And when the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said the same was "very likely" on Tuesday, his comment helped stock markets rise to highs for the year.
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 56.61 points, or 0.59 percent, to close at 9,683.41, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 0.31 percent or 3.29 points, to 1,052.63. The Nasdaq was 0.52 percent, or 10.86 points, higher, at 2,102.64.
Shares of basic-materials producers led the markets as commodities surged. Prices of oil and copper rose, and gold settled at $1,007.55 an ounce.
During questions after a speech in Washington, Mr. Bernanke said that "the recession is very likely over at this point," but warned that the economy would feel weak for some time as unemployment hovers at high levels.
Mr. Bernanke's measured outlook reflected concerns among investors, who wonder whether the market can continue adding to recent gains if the economy is running only at half-speed.
But a better-than-expected report on retail sales in August calmed some worries. Bolstered by higher gasoline prices and automobile sales from the cash-for-clunkers rebate program, retail sales grew 2.7 percent last month. Even clothing stores, book and hobby shops, and department stores reported gains.
Shares of Macy's climbed nearly 4.6 percent, while Saks, J. C. Penney and Dillard's were also higher.
"That's what fired it through the afternoon, the idea that the consumer is coming back," Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank, said of the gains. "That really has been the missing piece in recovery."
Many forecasters expect consumers to slow a recovery, rather than propel it, as they try to rebuild their personal finances and recover from shocks in the stock and housing markets. But to bullish analysts, stronger results in the government's retail numbers suggested that consumers might be feeling a bit bolder, even with unemployment near 10 percent.
Still, shrinking profit at the country's largest home-electronics chain and one of the largest grocers offered a stark example of how even market share and necessity are not insulating companies from the recession.
Earnings at the supermarket chainKroger fell 8 percent for the quarter ended Aug. 15 compared with a year earlier as shoppers focused on essential supplies and competition from discount chains increased. Shares of Kroger fell 7.5 percent, to $20.46.
Earnings at Best Buy fell 22 percent as sales at stores open at least a year slipped and its international performance weakened. But the company said its market share had been growing, reflecting business it had picked up from the closings of Circuit City retail stores. Shares of Best Buy dipped more than 5 percent, to $38.32.
An unexpected 1.7 percent increase in wholesale prices in August highlighted worries that inflation is creeping back as energy prices rise, lifting the cost of oil, gasoline and diesel.
Traders sold government bonds, whose relative returns are eaten away when prices rise. The Treasury's 10-year note fell 9/32, to 101 13/32, and the yield rose to 3.45 percent, from 3.42 percent late Monday.
Following are the results of Tuesday's Treasury auction of four-week bills:

Full text: The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said Tuesday that it was "very likely" that the recession had ended although he cautioned that it could be months before unemployment rates dropped significantly.
"Even though from a technical perspective the recession is very likely over at this point, it's still going to feel like a very weak economy for some time as many people will still find that their job security and their employment status is not what they wish it was," Mr. Bernanke said in response to a question about unemployment trends. "That's a challenge for us and all policy makers going forward."
The cautiously optimistic assessment came at the end of a speech at the Brookings Institution observing a year after a market crisis that was precipitated by the collapse of the investment bank Lehman Brothers.
Shortly before the speech, the Commerce Department reported that retail sales had surged in August as consumers swapped old cars for new ones under the "cash-for-clunkers" program. The increase, by a seasonally adjusted 2.7 percent rate over the previous month, widely surpassed analysts' expectations and was the largest monthly increase since January 2006.
Mr. Bernanke said the consensus of economic forecasters was for moderate economic growth for the remainder of this year and next, particularly as credit markets thaw, consumer confidence takes time to heal and the federal government begins to unwind spending and lending programs intended to mend the economy.
"The general view of forecasters is that growth in 2010 will be moderate, less than you might expect given the depth of the recession," Mr. Bernanke said, because of several issues, including continuing financial and credit problems, deleveraging by households and the need to end the economic stimulus programs. All these elements will "make the 2010 recovery moderate, in particular not much faster than the underlying growth rate of the economy," he added.
Business cycles are officially dated by a committee of economists at the National Bureau of Economic Research. The committee often spends many months sifting through economic trends before declaring the beginning and end dates of a recession. The latest recession began 12 months before it was officially declared in December 2008 by the committee.
For policy makers in Washington, a more significant question than the actual date of the end of the current recession will be when to begin unwinding the myriad lending and guarantee programs that were hastily created in response to the crisis. Officials at the Federal Reserve have already begun to consider the question.
Mr. Bernanke and other officials, including the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, have warned that removing the programs too early could lead to another round of problems. Historians now generally agree that, during the Great Depression, the early withdrawal of government programs in the 1930s led to deeper economic problems throughout that decade.
On the other hand, some analysts have warned that waiting too long could fuel significant price increases and lead to a return of corrosive levels of inflation.
The unwinding of the various spending programs and lower-interest rate policies of the Fed is not likely to be popular because, among other things, it could increase the cost of borrowing. That also threatens to increase the borrowing costs for the federal government, which already faces record deficits. And policy makers will have to confront decisions on retrenching government lending and spending programs just as lawmakers are facing midterm elections next year.
In his speech, a version of which he has made before, Mr. Bernanke defended the decisions by the central bank and other policy makers throughout the crisis and said that any hesitation in taking the emergency steps that were ultimately pursued by the Fed, the federal government and foreign powers could have led to a far steeper economic decline.
"Without these speedy and forceful actions, last October's panic would likely have continued to intensify, more major financial firms would have failed, and the entire global financial system would have been at serious risk," Mr. Bernanke said. "We cannot know for sure what the economic effects of these events would have been, but what we know about the effects of financial crises suggests that the resulting global downturn could have been extraordinarily deep and protracted."

Full text: President Obama's speech on overhauling the financial system was interrupted once by spontaneous -- if milquetoast -- applause. That seemed to reflect Wall Street's reaction.
Stock markets meandered on Monday afternoon as the crowds ebbed and the security and pomp accompanying Mr. Obama's visit to Lower Manhattan were dismantled. Stocks were slightly higher after Mr. Obama urged bank executives to accept new federal regulations and change the way they do business.
"We will not go back to the days of reckless behavior and unchecked excess that was at the heart of this crisis, where too many were motivated only by the appetite for quick kills and bloated bonuses," Mr. Obama said in his speech. "Those on Wall Street cannot resume taking risks without regard for consequences, and expect that next time, American taxpayers will be there to break their fall."
Shares wavered as he spoke to the polite, if unenthusiastic, crowd of financial executives, public officials and consumer advocates. Stocks edged up in afternoon trading.
At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average was 21.39 points, or 0.2 percent, higher at 9,626.80, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was 6.61 points, or 0.63 percent, higher at 1,049.34. The Nasdaq was up 10.88 points, or 0.52 percent, at 2,091.78.
With September -- historically Wall Street's worst month -- now half over, some analysts are cheered to see that stocks are up since the end of August.
"There's still a lot of strategists, a lot of money managers waiting for a pullback in the market," said Owen Fitzpatrick, head of equity trading at Deutsche Bank Private Wealth Management. "It will come, but it may not be as violent as we've seen in the past, just given the amount of cash that's sitting on the sidelines waiting to come in."
After a week containing few significant economic reports, investors this week will receive a passel of benchmarks on the economy's progress, with new figures on retail sales, wholesale and retail prices, new-home construction and industrial production.
The day's lift suggested that investors had smoothed over concerns about a rift between the United States and China over tires, chickens and trade barriers. The Nikkei index in Japan fell 2 percent, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng fell 1 percent, and shares were mixed across Europe.
But in New York, shares of the tire makers Goodyear and Cooper Tire and Rubber bounded higher, days after the Obama administration announced tariffs of as much as 35 percent on Chinese tires.
The Chinese government criticized the move and suggested it would fight back by imposing trade restrictions on American exports of chickens and automotive products. Shares of chicken producers including Tyson Foods and Pilgrim's Pride each fell more than 2 percent in New York.
Shares of Bank of America were mostly unchanged after a federal judge in New York threw out a settlement between the bank and the Securities and Exchange Commission over bonuses paid to Merrill Lynch executives as Bank of America was preparing to take over Merrill.
Other financial shares were mostly higher.
Meanwhile, investors unwound some of their recent bets in other corners of the market.
Gold prices, which soared to $1,006 an ounce last week, fell on Monday as traders cashed in some gains. Inflation-wary investors have been piling their money into gold recently, despite few signs that inflation is an imminent problem.
And the dollar regained some ground, after sliding to its lowest levels since September. As prices of gold and copper, silver and platinum have risen, the dollar has skidded lower against those commodities and other major currencies.
And crude oil prices fell 43 cents, to $68.86 a barrel, continuing their dance near the benchmark of $70.
Interest rates were higher. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 21/32, to 101 22/32 and the yield rose to 3.42 percent from 3.35 percent late Friday.
Following are the results of Monday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:

Full text: This time is different.
That's what people argue every time a bubble inflates, and what they think every time they are chastened by its popping. But century after century, decade after decade and year after year, human beings irrationally exuberate all over again.
Not long ago, the housing bubble burst and brought the global economy to a standstill. Now economists, recognizing that bubbles tend to come in bunches, are on the lookout for the next market to fizzle. They say that governments, central banks and international bodies should scrutinize a few markets that look likely to froth over in the next few years, like capital markets in China, commodities like gold and oil, and government bonds in heavily indebted countries like the United States.
"Globally, a lot of money is now seeking higher returns once again," said Rachel Ziemba, senior analyst at RGE Monitor. The steadying of the economy, liquidity injections by governments and big returns reaped early this year by investment banks are encouraging more traders to dip their toes back in the water in search of the next big thing.
"As long as compensation and bonuses are based on short-term performance in the market," she said, "that's going to encourage risk-seeking behavior."
Bubbles are episodes of collective human madness -- euphoria over investments whose skyrocketing values are unsustainable.
They tend to arise from perceptions of pending shortages (as happened last year, with the oil bubble); from glamorized new technologies or investment frontiers (like the dot-com bubble of the 1990s, the radio bubble of the 1920s or the multiple railroad bubbles of the 19th century); or from faddish cultural obsessions (like the Dutch tulip bubble of the 17th century, or the more recent Beanie Babies bubble).
Often they are based on legitimate expectations of high growth that are "extrapolated into the stratosphere," as the economist Daniel Yergin, chairman of IHS-Cambridge Energy Research Associates, put it. Such is the fear over investment in emerging markets like China.
"I'm a long-term bull on Asia, but right now it's premature to be celebrating the 'Asian Century,' like some investors seem to be doing," said Stephen Roach, chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia.
The Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index, for example, nearly doubled from November to July before pulling back last month. "People seem to believe the baton of global economic leadership is being seamlessly passed from the West to the East. That's going to happen, but not for another 5 to 10 years at least."
Similarly premature excitement inflated what became known as the South Sea bubble, a 18th century mania over British trade with emerging Latin American markets. (Aside: Even the brilliant Sir Isaac Newton, seduced by the mirage of infinitely rising stock prices, lost a lot in the South Sea bubble -- which is somewhat ironic, given his famous recognition that what goes up must come down.)
Economists also worry that commodity bubbles, which tend to be more cyclical, may strike again. Oil and gold prices are rising, and though both of those commodities have boomed and busted many times in the last century, investors may bet on unrealistically high growth once more. Gold prices, for example, have risen more than 30 percent from a year ago.
"With every commodity bubble, you see a whole new set of rationalizations," Mr. Yergin said. "People find ways to shut out the reality of economic processes. If oil prices shoot up, investors are always surprised to see demand go down again."
In each of these markets, the inflation and deflation of prices would be painful to investors but may not have as far-reaching consequences as the recent housing and credit collapses.
But a sovereign debt bubble -- which many argue is driving the acceleration in gold prices -- could prove far more dangerous.
So many countries, like the United States, are running up such large national debts as a percentage of their overall economies that they could risk eventual default. Even without outright default on their obligations, the value of government bonds sold to finance these deficits could plunge, costing investors a lot.
"Talk about a big bubble that really affects the global economy," said Kenneth Rogoff, an economics professor at Harvard whose new book, "This Time Is Different," chronicles 800 years of debt-driven financial crises.
"The huge run-up in government debt has led to patently unsustainable fiscal policies across a number of major countries," he said. "So far, the rest of the world's been willing to finance it, primarily with savings from China and elsewhere, but if investors' confidence is shaken, we might see the interest rates on long-term debt rising, and rising very sharply."
Debt crises are usually associated with developing countries, like Brazil, Argentina or Zimbabwe. But they can affect big, rich economies too, where the scale of global damage can be much greater.
"Look at California," Mr. Rogoff said. "It's incredibly rich, but Californians want a lot of services but don't feel like taxing themselves to pay for them. You can be incredibly rich and still go bankrupt."
The depth and breadth of the pain unleashed by the recent housing bust have led political leaders and central bankers to reconsider their duties to pre-empt, rather than just respond to, potential bubbles, and the same is true with the potential bubbles that economists foresee today.
China has started to tighten monetary policy to rein in the hype surrounding its equities. Politicians in the United States, while torn over the means, are discussing ways to bring the deficit until control.
The Group of 20, at its coming meeting in Pittsburgh, is expected to address ways to calm financial frenzies. The solution may involve additional regulation, guidelines for financial compensation and possibly requirements for more market transparency so that, at least in theory, investors can better judge what they are taking on.
But however stringent such new regulations may be, economists say, they cannot completely defeat human nature. Investors will continue to be hypnotized by get-rich-quick deals, seeking investments that magically double, double without toil or trouble.
"Ultimately, bubbles are a human phenomenon," said Robert Shiller, a Yale economics professor and Cassandra of the current crisis. "People just get a little crazy."

Full text: THE NEWS The typical American household made less money last year than it made a decade ago, according to new figures from the Census Bureau.
BEHIND THE NEWS In the four decades that the bureau has been tracking household income, median income has never failed to rise until now. Adjusted for inflation, it slipped to $50,303 last year from $51,295 in 1998. One reason: economic growth in the current decade has been slower than in any decade since before World War II. Income inequality also expanded, to the benefit of a small slice of the wealthy. "We've seen a lost decade for the typical American family," said the economist Lawrence Katz.
THE NEWS The number of families threatened with losing their homes held steady last month.
BEHIND THE NEWS A report by RealtyTrac Inc. suggested that efforts by lenders to helped troubled borrowers may be having a gradual impact. Bank repossessions actually dropped 13 percent from July. Still, more than 358,000 foreclosure-related filings were recorded in August, one for every 358 homes in the United States. That was up 18 percent from a year ago, despite a new Federal Reserve survey that suggested the recession is ending. Nevada had the nation's highest foreclosure rate, followed by Florida, California, Arizona and Michigan.
THE NEWS An exotic mortgage that became popular during the housing boom is now threatening to put a brake on any revival in home prices.
BEHIND THE NEWS Interest-only loans put off principal payments for 5, 7 or 10 years. But those interest-only periods are now beginning to expire and many of those mortgages will become unaffordable as homeowners start paying principal, which can push up monthly payments by as much as 75 percent. Making matters worse, many of those homes are now worth less than the loans against them. In the next 12 months, $71 billion of those mortgages will reset. And the numbers get bigger in coming years.
THE NEWS The partnership that owns the 110 apartment buildings at Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village in Manhattan are facing default after paying $5.4 billion for the complex three years ago.
BEHIND THE NEWS The 11,227 apartments, more than half of them rent-regulated, have long been an oasis of affordability for middle-class New Yorkers. But the complex has lost more than half its value since Jerry I. and Rob Speyer and BlackRock Realty bought it. Analysts say the partners are at "high risk" of default. Tenants would not be likely to face big rent increases or eviction. But they may face deferred maintenance and delayed improvements.
THE NEWS One high-end property is attracting a lot of attention from potential buyers despite the real estate slump: Bernard L. Madoff's Montauk beach house.
BEHIND THE NEWS The United States Marshals Service is overseeing the sale of the 3,000-square-foot house on the dunes; proceeds will go into a fund for victims of Mr. Madoff's $65 billion Ponzi scheme. The property went on the market for $8.75 million on Sept. 1 and there were 23 showings over the Labor Day weekend. Other Madoff properties, including a Manhattan penthouse and a house in Palm Beach, Fla., will also be sold. Mr. Madoff has a taken up residence at a penitentiary in Butner, N.C.

Abstract: State officials have repeatedly ignored obvious illegal dumping, and the Environmental Protection Agency, which can prosecute polluters when states fail to act, has often declined to intervene. Because it is difficult to determine what causes diseases like cancer, it is impossible to know how many illnesses are the result of water pollution, or contaminants' role in the health problems of specific individuals.

Full text: Jennifer Hall-Massey knows not to drink the tap water in her home near Charleston, W.Va.
In fact, her entire family tries to avoid any contact with the water. Her youngest son has scabs on his arms, legs and chest where the bathwater -- polluted with lead, nickel and other heavy metals -- caused painful rashes. Many of his brother's teeth were capped to replace enamel that was eaten away.
Neighbors apply special lotions after showering because their skin burns. Tests show that their tap water contains arsenic, barium, lead, manganese and other chemicals at concentrations federal regulators say could contribute to cancer and damage the kidneys and nervous system.
"How can we get digital cable and Internet in our homes, but not clean water?" said Mrs. Hall-Massey, a senior accountant at one of the state's largest banks.
She and her husband, Charles, do not live in some remote corner of Appalachia. Charleston, the state capital, is less than 17 miles from her home.
"How is this still happening today?" she asked.
When Mrs. Hall-Massey and 264 neighbors sued nine nearby coal companies, accusing them of putting dangerous waste into local water supplies, their lawyer did not have to look far for evidence. As required by state law, some of the companies had disclosed in reports to regulators that they were pumping into the ground illegal concentrations of chemicals -- the same pollutants that flowed from residents' taps.
But state regulators never fined or punished those companies for breaking those pollution laws.
This pattern is not limited to West Virginia. Almost four decades ago, Congress passed the Clean Water Act to force polluters to disclose the toxins they dump into waterways and to give regulators the power to fine or jail offenders. States have passed pollution statutes of their own. But in recent years, violations of the Clean Water Act have risen steadily across the nation, an extensive review of water pollution records by The New York Times found.
In the last five years alone, chemical factories, manufacturing plants and other workplaces have violated water pollution laws more than half a million times. The violations range from failing to report emissions to dumping toxins at concentrations regulators say might contribute to cancer, birth defects and other illnesses.
However, the vast majority of those polluters have escaped punishment. State officials have repeatedly ignored obvious illegal dumping, and the Environmental Protection Agency, which can prosecute polluters when states fail to act, has often declined to intervene.
Because it is difficult to determine what causes diseases like cancer, it is impossible to know how many illnesses are the result of water pollution, or contaminants' role in the health problems of specific individuals.
But concerns over these toxins are great enough that Congress and the E.P.A. regulate more than 100 pollutants through the Clean Water Act and strictly limit 91 chemicals or contaminants in tap water through the Safe Drinking Water Act.
Regulators themselves acknowledge lapses. The new E.P.A. administrator, Lisa P. Jackson, said in an interview that despite many successes since the Clean Water Act was passed in 1972, today the nation's water does not meet public health goals, and enforcement of water pollution laws is unacceptably low. She added that strengthening water protections is among her top priorities. State regulators say they are doing their best with insufficient resources.
The Times obtained hundreds of thousands of water pollution records through Freedom of Information Act requests to every state and the E.P.A., and compiled a national database of water pollution violations that is more comprehensive than those maintained by states or the E.P.A. (For an interactive version, which can show violations in any community, visit www.nytimes.com/toxicwaters.)
In addition, The Times interviewed more than 250 state and federal regulators, water-system managers, environmental advocates and scientists.
That research shows that an estimated one in 10 Americans have been exposed to drinking water that contains dangerous chemicals or fails to meet a federal health benchmark in other ways.
Those exposures include carcinogens in the tap water of major American cities and unsafe chemicals in drinking-water wells. Wells, which are not typically regulated by the Safe Drinking Water Act, are more likely to contain contaminants than municipal water systems.
Because most of today's water pollution has no scent or taste, many people who consume dangerous chemicals do not realize it, even after they become sick, researchers say.
But an estimated 19.5 million Americans fall ill each year from drinking water contaminated with parasites, bacteria or viruses, according to a study published last year in the scientific journal Reviews of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology. That figure does not include illnesses caused by other chemicals and toxins.
In the nation's largest dairy states, like Wisconsin and California, farmers have sprayed liquefied animal feces onto fields, where it has seeped into wells, causing severe infections. Tap water in parts of the Farm Belt, including cities in Illinois, Kansas, Missouri and Indiana, has contained pesticides at concentrations that some scientists have linked to birth defects and fertility problems.
In parts of New York, Rhode Island, Ohio, California and other states where sewer systems cannot accommodate heavy rains, untreated human waste has flowed into rivers and washed onto beaches. Drinking water in parts of New Jersey, New York, Arizona and Massachusetts shows some of the highest concentrations of tetrachloroethylene, a dry cleaning solvent that has been linked to kidney damage and cancer. (Specific types of water pollution across the United States will be examined in future Times articles.)
The Times's research also shows that last year, 40 percent of the nation's community water systems violated the Safe Drinking Water Act at least once, according to an analysis of E.P.A. data. Those violations ranged from failing to maintain proper paperwork to allowing carcinogens into tap water. More than 23 million people received drinking water from municipal systems that violated a health-based standard.
In some cases, people got sick right away. In other situations, pollutants like chemicals, inorganic toxins and heavy metals can accumulate in the body for years or decades before they cause problems. Some of the most frequently detected contaminants have been linked to cancer, birth defects and neurological disorders.
Records analyzed by The Times indicate that the Clean Water Act has been violated more than 506,000 times since 2004, by more than 23,000 companies and other facilities, according to reports submitted by polluters themselves. Companies sometimes test what they are dumping only once a quarter, so the actual number of days when they broke the law is often far higher. And some companies illegally avoid reporting their emissions, say officials, so infractions go unrecorded.
Environmental groups say the number of Clean Water Act violations has increased significantly in the last decade. Comprehensive data go back only five years but show that the number of facilities violating the Clean Water Act grew more than 16 percent from 2004 to 2007, the most recent year with complete data.
Polluters include small companies, like gas stations, dry cleaners, shopping malls and the Friendly Acres Mobile Home Park in Laporte, Ind., which acknowledged to regulators that it had dumped human waste into a nearby river for three years.
They also include large operations, like chemical factories, power plants, sewage treatment centers and one of the biggest zinc smelters, the Horsehead Corporation of Pennsylvania, which has dumped illegal concentrations of copper, lead, zinc, chlorine and selenium into the Ohio River. Those chemicals can contribute to mental retardation and cancer.
Some violations are relatively minor. But about 60 percent of the polluters were deemed in "significant noncompliance" -- meaning their violations were the most serious kind, like dumping cancer-causing chemicals or failing to measure or report when they pollute.
Finally, the Times's research shows that fewer than 3 percent of Clean Water Act violations resulted in fines or other significant punishments by state officials. And the E.P.A. has often declined to prosecute polluters or force states to strengthen their enforcement by threatening to withhold federal money or take away powers the agency has delegated to state officials.
Neither Friendly Acres Mobile Home Park nor Horsehead, for instance, was fined for Clean Water Act violations in the last eight years. A representative of Friendly Acres declined to comment. Indiana officials say they are investigating the mobile home park. A representative of Horsehead said the company had taken steps to control pollution and was negotiating with regulators to clean up its emissions.
Numerous state and federal lawmakers said they were unaware that pollution was so widespread.
"I don't think anyone realized how bad things have become," said Representative James L. Oberstar, a Minnesota Democrat, when told of The Times's findings. Mr. Oberstar is chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, which has jurisdiction over many water-quality issues.
"The E.P.A. and states have completely dropped the ball," he said. "Without oversight and enforcement, companies will use our lakes and rivers as dumping grounds -- and that's exactly what is apparently going on."
The E.P.A. administrator, Ms. Jackson, whose appointment was confirmed in January, said in an interview that she intended to strengthen enforcement of the Clean Water Act and pressure states to apply the law.
"I've been saying since Day One I want to work on these water issues pretty broadly across the country," she said. On Friday, the E.P.A. said that it was reviewing dozens of coal-mining permits in West Virginia and three other states to make sure they would not violate the Clean Water Act.
After E.P.A. officials received detailed questions from The New York Times in June, Ms. Jackson sent a memo to her enforcement deputy noting that the E.P.A. is "falling short of this administration's expectations for the effectiveness of our clean water enforcement programs. Data available to E.P.A. shows that, in many parts of the country, the level of significant noncompliance with permitting requirements is unacceptably high and the level of enforcement activity is unacceptably low."
State officials, for their part, attribute rising pollution rates to increased workloads and dwindling resources. In 46 states, local regulators have primary responsibility for crucial aspects of the Clean Water Act. Though the number of regulated facilities has more than doubled in the last 10 years, many state enforcement budgets have remained essentially flat when adjusted for inflation. In New York, for example, the number of regulated polluters has almost doubled to 19,000 in the last decade, but the number of inspections each year has remained about the same.
But stretched resources are only part of the reason polluters escape punishment. The Times's investigation shows that in West Virginia and other states, powerful industries have often successfully lobbied to undermine effective regulation.
State officials also argue that water pollution statistics include minor infractions, like failing to file reports, which do not pose risks to human health, and that records collected by The Times failed to examine informal enforcement methods, like sending warning letters.
"We work enormously hard inspecting our coal mines, analyzing water samples, notifying companies of violations when we detect them," said Randy Huffman, head of West Virginia's Department of Environmental Protection. "When I look at how far we've come in protecting the state's waters since we took responsibility for the Clean Water Act, I think we have a lot to be proud of."
But unchecked pollution remains a problem in many states. West Virginia offers a revealing example of why so many companies escape punishment.
One Community's Plight
The mountains surrounding the home of Mrs. Hall-Massey's family and West Virginia's nearby capital have long been mined for coal. And for years, the area enjoyed clean well water.
But starting about a decade ago, awful smells began coming from local taps. The water was sometimes gray, cloudy and oily. Bathtubs and washers developed rust-colored rings that scrubbing could not remove. When Mrs. Hall-Massey's husband installed industrial water filters, they quickly turned black. Tests showed that their water contained toxic amounts of lead, manganese, barium and other metals that can contribute to organ failure or developmental problems.
Around that time, nearby coal companies had begun pumping industrial waste into the ground.
Mining companies often wash their coal to remove impurities. The leftover liquid -- a black fluid containing dissolved minerals and chemicals, known as sludge or slurry -- is often disposed of in vast lagoons or through injection into abandoned mines. The liquid in those lagoons and shafts can flow through cracks in the earth into water supplies. Companies must regularly send samples of the injected liquid to labs, which provide reports that are forwarded to state regulators.
In the eight miles surrounding Mrs. Hall-Massey's home, coal companies have injected more than 1.9 billion gallons of coal slurry and sludge into the ground since 2004, according to a review of thousands of state records. Millions more gallons have been dumped into lagoons.
These underground injections have contained chemicals at concentrations that pose serious health risks, and thousands of injections have violated state regulations and the Safe Drinking Water Act, according to reports sent to the state by companies themselves.
For instance, three coal companies -- Loadout, Remington Coal and Pine Ridge, a subsidiary of Peabody Energy, one of the largest coal companies in the world -- reported to state officials that 93 percent of the waste they injected near this community had illegal concentrations of chemicals including arsenic, lead, chromium, beryllium or nickel.
Sometimes those concentrations exceeded legal limits by as much as 1,000 percent. Those chemicals have been shown to contribute to cancer, organ failures and other diseases.
But those companies were never fined or punished for those illegal injections, according to state records. They were never even warned that their activities had been noticed.
Remington Coal declined to comment. A representative of Loadout's parent said the company had assigned its permit to another company, which ceased injecting in 2006. Peabody Energy, which spun off Pine Ridge in 2007, said that some data sent to regulators was inaccurate and that the company's actions reflected best industry practices.
West Virginia officials, when asked about these violations, said regulators had accidentally overlooked many pollution records the companies submitted until after the statute of limitations had passed, so no action was taken. They also said their studies indicated that those injections could not have affected drinking water in the area and that other injections also had no detectable effect.
State officials noted that they had cited more than 4,200 water pollution violations at mine sites around the state since 2000, as well as conducted thousands of investigations. The state has initiated research about how mining affects water quality. After receiving questions from The Times, officials announced a statewide moratorium on issuing injection permits and told some companies that regulators were investigating their injections.
"Many of the issues you are examining are several years old, and many have been addressed," West Virginia officials wrote in a statement. The state's pollution program "has had its share of issues," regulators wrote. However, "it is important to note that if the close scrutiny given to our state had been given to others, it is likely that similar issues would have been found."
More than 350 other companies and facilities in West Virginia have also violated the Clean Water Act in recent years, records show. Those infractions include releasing illegal concentrations of iron, manganese, aluminum and other chemicals into lakes and rivers.
As the water in Mrs. Hall-Massey's community continued to worsen, residents began complaining of increased health problems. Gall bladder diseases, fertility problems, miscarriages and kidney and thyroid issues became common, according to interviews.
When Mrs. Hall-Massey's family left on vacation, her sons' rashes cleared up. When they returned, the rashes reappeared. Her dentist told her that chemicals appeared to be damaging her teeth and her son's, she said. As the quality of her water worsened, Mrs. Hall-Massey's once-healthy teeth needed many crowns. Her son brushed his teeth often, used a fluoride rinse twice a day and was not allowed to eat sweets. Even so, he continued getting cavities until the family stopped using tap water. By the time his younger brother's teeth started coming in, the family was using bottled water to brush. He has not had dental problems.
Medical professionals in the area say residents show unusually high rates of health problems. A survey of more than 100 residents conducted by a nurse hired by Mrs. Hall-Massey's lawyer indicated that as many as 30 percent of people in this area have had their gallbladders removed, and as many as half the residents have significant tooth enamel damage, chronic stomach problems and other illnesses. That research was confirmed through interviews with residents.
It is difficult to determine which companies, if any, are responsible for the contamination that made its way into tap water or to conclude which specific chemicals, if any, are responsible for particular health problems. Many coal companies say they did not pollute the area's drinking water and chose injection sites that flowed away from nearby homes.
An independent study by a university researcher challenges some of those claims.
"I don't know what else could be polluting these wells," said Ben Stout, a biology professor at Wheeling Jesuit University who tested the water in this community and elsewhere in West Virginia. "The chemicals coming out of people's taps are identical to the chemicals the coal companies are pumping into the ground."
One night, Mrs. Hall-Massey's 6-year-old son, Clay, asked to play in the tub. When he got out, his bright red rashes hurt so much he could not fall asleep. Soon, Mrs. Hall-Massey began complaining to state officials. They told her they did not know why her water was bad, she recalls, but doubted coal companies had done anything wrong. The family put their house on the market, but because of the water, buyers were not interested.
In December, Mrs. Hall-Massey and neighbors sued in county court, seeking compensation. That suit is pending. To resolve a related lawsuit filed about the same time, the community today gets regular deliveries of clean drinking water, stored in coolers or large blue barrels outside most homes. Construction began in August on a pipeline bringing fresh water to the community.
But for now most residents still use polluted water to bathe, shower and wash dishes.
"A parent's only real job is to protect our children," Mrs. Hall-Massey said. "But where was the government when we needed them to protect us from this stuff?"
Regulators 'Overwhelmed'
Matthew Crum, a 43-year-old lawyer, wanted to protect people like Mrs. Hall-Massey. That is why he joined West Virginia's environmental protection agency in 2001, when it became clear that the state's and nation's streams and rivers were becoming more polluted.
But he said he quickly learned that good intentions could not compete with intimidating politicians and a fearful bureaucracy.
Mr. Crum grew up during a golden age of environmental activism. He was in elementary school when Congress passed the Clean Water Act of 1972 in response to environmental disasters, including a fire on the polluted Cuyahoga River in Cleveland. The act's goal was to eliminate most water pollution by 1985 and prohibit the "discharge of toxic pollutants in toxic amounts."
"There were a bunch of us that were raised with the example of the Clean Water Act as inspiration," he said. "I wanted to be part of that fight."
In the two decades after the act's passage, the nation's waters grew much healthier. The Cuyahoga River, West Virginia's Kanawha River and hundreds of other beaches, streams and ponds were revitalized.
But in the late 1990s, some states' enforcement of pollution laws began tapering off, according to regulators and environmentalists. Soon the E.P.A. started reporting that the nation's rivers, lakes and estuaries were becoming dirtier again. Mr. Crum, after a stint in Washington with the Justice Department and the birth of his first child, joined West Virginia's Department of Environmental Protection, where new leadership was committed to revitalizing the Clean Water Act.
He said his idealism was tested within two weeks, when he was called to a huge coal spill into a stream.
"I met our inspector at the spill site, and we had this really awkward conversation," Mr. Crum recalled. "I said we should shut down the mine until everything was cleaned up. The inspector agreed, but he said if he issued that order, he was scared of getting demoted or transferred to the middle of nowhere. Everyone was terrified of doing their job."
Mr. Crum temporarily shut the mine.
In the next two years, he shut many polluting mines until they changed their ways. His tough approach raised his profile around the state.
Mining companies, worried about attracting Mr. Crum's attention, began improving their waste disposal practices, executives from that period said. But they also began complaining to their friends in the state's legislature, they recalled in interviews, and started a whisper campaign accusing Mr. Crum of vendettas against particular companies -- though those same executives now admit they had no evidence for those claims.
In 2003, a new director, Stephanie Timmermeyer, was nominated to run the Department of Environmental Protection. One of West Virginia's most powerful state lawmakers, Eustace Frederick, said she would be confirmed, but only if she agreed to fire Mr. Crum, according to several people who said they witnessed the conversation.
She was given the job and soon summoned Mr. Crum to her office. He was dismissed two weeks after his second child's birth.
Ms. Timmermeyer, who resigned in 2008, did not return calls. Mr. Frederick died last year.
Since then, hundreds of workplaces in West Virginia have violated pollution laws without paying fines. A half-dozen current and former employees, in interviews, said their enforcement efforts had been undermined by bureaucratic disorganization, a departmental preference to let polluters escape punishment if they promise to try harder, and a revolving door of regulators who leave for higher-paying jobs at the companies they once policed.
"We are outmanned and overwhelmed, and that's exactly how industry wants us," said one employee who requested anonymity for fear of being fired. "It's been obvious for decades that we're not on top of things, and coal companies have earned billions relying on that."
In June, four environmental groups petitioned the E.P.A. to take over much of West Virginia's handling of the Clean Water Act, citing a "nearly complete breakdown" in the state. The E.P.A. has asked state officials to respond and said it is investigating the petition.
Similar problems exist in other states, where critics say regulators have often turned a blind eye to polluters. Regulators in five other states, in interviews, said they had been pressured by industry-friendly politicians to drop continuing pollution investigations.
"Unless the E.P.A. is pushing state regulators, a culture of transgression and apathy sets in," said William K. Reilly, who led the E.P.A. under President George H. W. Bush.
In response, many state officials defend their efforts. A spokeswoman for West Virginia's Department of Environmental Protection, for instance, said that between 2006 and 2008, the number of cease-operation orders issued by regulators was 10 percent higher than during Mr. Crum's two-year tenure.
Mr. Huffman, the department's head, said there is no political interference with current investigations. Department officials say they continue to improve the agency's procedures, and note that regulators have assessed $14.7 million in state fines against more than 70 mining companies since 2006.
However, that is about equal to the revenue those businesses' parent companies collect every 10 hours, according to financial reports. (To find out about every state's enforcement record and read comments from regulators, visit www.nytimes.com/waterdata.)
"The real test is, is our water clean?" said Mr. Huffman. "When the Clean Water Act was passed, this river that flows through our capital was very dirty. Thirty years later, it's much cleaner because we've chosen priorities carefully."
Some regulators admit that polluters have fallen through the cracks. To genuinely improve enforcement, they say, the E.P.A. needs to lead.
"If you don't have vigorous oversight by the feds, then everything just goes limp," said Mr. Crum. "Regulators can't afford to have some backbone unless they know Washington or the governor's office will back them up."
It took Mr. Crum a while to recover from his firing. He moved to Virginia to work at the Nature Conservancy, an environmental conservation group. Today, he is in private practice and works on the occasional environmental lawsuit.
"We're moving backwards," he said, "and it's heartbreaking."
Shortcomings of the E.P.A.
The memos are marked "DO NOT DISTRIBUTE."
They were written this year by E.P.A. staff, the culmination of a five-year investigation of states' enforcement of federal pollution laws. And in bland, bureaucratic terms, they describe a regulatory system -- at the E.P.A. and among state agencies -- that in many ways simply does not work.
For years, according to one memo, federal regulators knew that more than 30 states had major problems documenting which companies were violating pollution laws. Another notes that states' "personnel lack direction, ability or training" to levy fines large enough to deter polluters.
But often, the memos say, the E.P.A. never corrected those problems even though they were widely acknowledged. The E.P.A. "may hesitate to push the states" out of "fear of risking their relationships," one report reads. Another notes that E.P.A. offices lack "a consistent national oversight strategy."
Some of those memos, part of an effort known as the State Review Framework, were obtained from agency employees who asked for anonymity, and others through Freedom of Information Act requests.
Enforcement lapses were particularly bad under the administration of President George W. Bush, employees say. "For the last eight years, my hands have been tied," said one E.P.A. official who requested anonymity for fear of retribution. "We were told to take our clean water and clean air cases, put them in a box, and lock it shut. Everyone knew polluters were getting away with murder. But these polluters are some of the biggest campaign contributors in town, so no one really cared if they were dumping poisons into streams."
The E.P.A. administrators during the last eight years -- Christine Todd Whitman, Michael O. Leavitt and Stephen L. Johnson -- all declined to comment.
When President Obama chose Ms. Jackson to head the E.P.A., many environmentalists and agency employees were encouraged. During his campaign, Mr. Obama promised to "reinvigorate the drinking water standards that have been weakened under the Bush administration and update them to address new threats." He pledged to regulate water pollution from livestock operations and push for amendments to the Clean Water Act.
But some worry those promises will not be kept. Water issues have taken a back seat to other environmental concerns, like carbon emissions.
In an interview, Ms. Jackson noted that many of the nation's waters were healthier today than when the Clean Water Act was passed and said she intended to enforce the law more vigorously. After receiving detailed questions from The Times, she put many of the State Review Framework documents on the agency's Web site, and ordered more disclosure of the agency's handling of water issues, increased enforcement and revamped technology so that facilities' environmental records are more accessible.
"Do critics have a good and valid point when they say improvements need to be made? Absolutely," Ms. Jackson said. "But I think we need to be careful not to do that by scaring the bejesus out of people into thinking that, boy, are things horrible. What it requires is attention, and I'm going to give it that attention."
In statements, E.P.A. officials noted that from 2006 to 2008, the agency conducted 11,000 Clean Water Act and 21,000 Safe Drinking Water Act inspections, and referred 146 cases to the Department of Justice. During the 2007 to 2008 period, officials wrote, 92 percent of the population served by community water systems received water that had no reported health-based violations.
The Times's reporting, the statements added, "does not distinguish between significant violations and minor violations," and "as a result, the conclusions may present an unduly alarming picture." They wrote that "much of the country's water quality problems are caused by discharges from nonpoint sources of pollution, such as agricultural runoff, which cannot be corrected solely through enforcement."
Ultimately, lawmakers and environmental activists say, the best solution is for Congress to hold the E.P.A. and states accountable for their failures.
The Clean Water Act, they add, should be expanded to police other types of pollution -- like farm and livestock runoff -- that are largely unregulated. And they say Congress should give state agencies more resources, in the same way that federal dollars helped overhaul the nation's sewage systems in the 1970s.
Some say changes will not occur without public outrage.
"When we started regulating water pollution in the 1970s, there was a huge public outcry because you could see raw sewage flowing into the rivers," said William D. Ruckelshaus, who served as the first head of the Environmental Protection Agency under President Richard M. Nixon, and then again under President Ronald Reagan.
"Today the violations are much more subtle -- pesticides and chemicals you can't see or smell that are even more dangerous," he added. "And so a lot of the public pressure on regulatory agencies has ebbed away."

Long before "subprime" entered the American lexicon, before Wall Street convulsed with the collapse of giant institutions and the financial world seized with fear, a slower-moving crisis was already under way for tens of millions of ordinary people like Ms. Thomas.

Full text: Millions of Americans have lost homes, jobs and savings to the financial crisis and recession. While greed and extravagance played roles, many lived beyond their means because their paychecks shrank. This article is adapted from "Past Due: The End of Easy Money and the Renewal of the American Economy," by Peter S. Goodman, a reporter for The New York Times. The book, to be published Tuesday by Times Books, explores the origins of the crisis and suggests ways to reinvigorate the economy.
ONE afternoon in November 2006, a policeman spotted an expired license plate on Dorothy Thomas's 10-year-old Toyota Corolla as she drove through San Jose, Calif. He ordered her to pull over.
Struggling under the weight of thousands of dollars in credit card bills, Ms. Thomas was perpetually short of cash. She had not bought a $10 auto registration sticker. The officer checked his database and recognized that she had already been ticketed once before for the same thing. He arranged to have her car towed away.
"I got down on my knees and begged that officer," Ms. Thomas recalled.
As she watched her car being hauled off, she sensed that this was the beginning of a descent into a crisis from which she might not easily escape. Without money to pay the towing and storage fees, she could not extract her car from the lot, and the tab soon grew to $1,600. Without a car, she could not reach the hospital where she worked in the administrative offices, so she lost her $16-an-hour job. Without a paycheck, she could no longer pay the rent on her modest home. She moved to Oakland, where a friend lived in a beaten-down, rented house on a street they called Crack Avenue. By year's end, Ms. Thomas, then 49, was occupying a bunk at a homeless shelter, searching in vain for a job in an economy plagued by unemployment.
Across the United States a sense has taken hold that the Great Recession and the financial crisis are predominantly a result of national profligacy, as if the economy had been undone by insatiable shoppers, foolhardy home buyers and greedy investment bankers. Extravagance and recklessness certainly played crucial roles, and yet they are only part of the explanation.
Many have lived beyond their incomes simply because incomes have been outstripped by the costs of middle-class life. By the fall of 2008, most American workers were bringing home roughly the same weekly wages they had earned in 1983, after accounting for inflation.
"For middle- and low-wage workers, the median wage basically went nowhere over these years," said the economist Jared Bernstein.
Spirited and eloquent, Ms. Thomas had worked her way up from rural Oklahoma poverty, enduring the strains of forcibly integrated schools, before settling in California. She had become one of the first African-Americans to sell cosmetics at a Sacramento department store. Then, she forged a career in medical billing, at one point making $22 an hour. She had lived beyond her means, but not out of decadence. For years, she had rented homes in better neighborhoods than she could afford in order to send her two daughters to quality schools. She had run up credit card balances to pay for summer science camps and school supplies. She had never earned more than a high school diploma, but one of her daughters already had a master's in education; the other was about to start college.
"I truly bought into the idea that education is the way out of poverty," Ms. Thomas said. "If your kids are going to school with kids who are preprogrammed to go to college, then that's what they will expect. I didn't get myself out of poverty. But I got my daughters out. I was the bridge."
Long before "subprime" entered the American lexicon, before Wall Street convulsed with the collapse of giant institutions and the financial world seized with fear, a slower-moving crisis was already under way for tens of millions of ordinary people like Ms. Thomas. The shock of recent times has merely intensified this deeper crisis, rendering void a mode of living that was already unsustainable.
As wages stagnated, and as the costs of health care and education spiraled higher, easy money filled the gap: shrinking paychecks were masked by an explosion of consumer credit and by a pair of investment manias that made money surge through the American economy -- one centered on the supposedly limitless promise of the Internet, the other propelled by faith that real estate values could only climb.
On the backs of these fantasies, the financial system lent out ridiculous sums of money to businesses and homeowners, as if the laws of supply and demand had been repealed.
Americans became addicted to dreaming up the Next Big Thing, telling one another stories that seemed to justify pouring money into stocks, real estate and exotic new investments. A nation skilled in innovation and craftsmanship relinquished its traditional focus on engineering goods and services of intrinsic value in favor of financial make-believe, mostly unchecked by government regulation.
As exotic mortgages proliferated along with inscrutable investments backed by home payments, respected leaders like Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, and Robert E. Rubin and Lawrence H. Summers -- both Treasury secretaries in the Clinton administration -- silenced those inclined to damp the festivities with limits on how much money financial institutions could put into play.
Bankers operating freely would assess risks better than bureaucrats, they counseled, enabling gold rush fever to flourish on Wall Street and in every suburban cul-de-sac, while the consequences of failure swelled to monstrous proportions.
"Proposals to bring even minimalist regulation were basically rebuffed by Greenspan and various people in the Treasury," recalled Alan S. Blinder, who served with Mr. Greenspan on the board of governors at the Federal Reserve.
Easy money generated economic growth and spread riches. Yet when arithmetic reasserted itself, annihilating trillions of dollars in wealth and millions of jobs, the economy was left with a debilitating case of disillusionment: once markets lost faith in make-believe, they starved the economy of capital. Even people who had barely benefited -- people like Dorothy Thomas -- suffered an outsize share of hurt.
The challenge now confronting American society is how to transition from an era in which we spent and consumed in brazen disregard of traditional limits into a new period in which we live on what we bring home from work. Yet just as Americans most need jobs to rebuild savings and pay off past-due bills, jobs are in exceedingly scarce supply.
"If you had told me before that a person could look for a year and not find a job, I'd have said they were just lazy," Ms. Thomas said. "Every day, I feel like I'm losing a piece of myself."
BY early 2008, the electricity and water had been cut for lack of payment at the house on Crack Avenue. For Ms. Thomas, 12 months had passed without work, despite dozens of applications at medical billing offices -- those she could reach without a car. One potential employer rejected her after she failed a credit check.
"They're saying that credit is a reflection of your character," she said, choking back tears.
The confident young woman who had once sold expensive cosmetics had become a middle-aged woman bulging out of sweat pants, her face sagging with exhaustion, her hair matted for lack of access to a shower. Each rejection intensified her fears that she might never work again.
"Is it my age?" she asked. "Is it because I've gained weight?" She had been visiting a nearby food bank. "They give us cakes and cookies," she said. "Then you wonder why poor people are fat! They're not giving us fruits and vegetables."
She riffled through a folder, proffering her resume -- evidence that she belonged in the white-collar world. "I'm articulate," she said, shifting into the smooth tones of a receptionist as she pantomimed answering the phone. "How may I direct your call?"
"When you get discouraged, it's hard to recover," she said. "People who aren't poor, it's as if they think we don't know what our lives are like and what's happening to us. But we know. Poverty is like a prison without bars."
Three months later, the crumbling house on Crack Avenue fell into foreclosure, and Ms. Thomas was forced out. She thought of asking her oldest daughter for help. But her daughter was struggling to pay her own bills on a teacher's salary. So Ms. Thomas checked into a homeless shelter for battered women and substance abusers. She pretended to be a drug addict in order to stay, using the free bed as an opportunity to reconstruct her life.
In November, she got a job scheduling appointments for a chain of medical clinics for $16 an hour. She could reach the offices using public transportation. She wore a crisp white blouse and a neat ponytail. Her face radiated calm.
"I feel so good," she said, "because I feel so normal."
A long stretch of hopelessness had given way to the outlines of a future. A few weeks later, she had saved $1,600. Soon, she bought a used car, a Toyota Rav 4, which greatly expanded her field of potential workplaces. Another few months of work and saving and she figured to have enough to recover her independence.
But in late January this year, with the economy still deteriorating, her new employer laid her off.
"That first week, I really slipped under," she said. "I did feel suicidal. I just felt so knocked off the block. To lose that job was just devastating."
She was sobbing.
"I'm back at Square One," she said.
MUCH the same might be said of the American economy. Many experts say it may take years to fully recover, creating enough decent-paying jobs so that paychecks can replace home equity loans and credit cards as fuel for spending. "The open question is whether we're in for a bad couple of years, or a bad decade," said Kenneth S. Rogoff, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund.
As attention focuses on how best to nurture good jobs, many advocate increased government investment into research institutions to spur innovation, in addition to tax incentives for private ventures that turn the resulting know-how into businesses. Renewable energy and biotechnology exemplify how such public-private partnerships have already produced jobs. Amid mounting concerns about climate change, states are compelling utilities to buy energy from clean sources, creating new markets for wind power and solar energy.
Iowa is exploiting its position on the Great Plains -- the so-called Saudi Arabia of wind -- to manufacture wind turbines. Toledo's glass factories, confronting declining orders for auto windshields, are focused on making solar panels. North Carolina has twinned the brainpower of its research universities with its engineering prowess to construct a thriving hub of biotechnology, employing people laid off from tobacco and textiles.
These are merely examples of one fruitful approach to creating jobs, say economists, one that may be applied to myriad other areas of American industry. Silicon Valley remains a hotbed of valuable thinking. Wall Street -- much maligned though it may be -- retains important skills that await incentives to make it function in the national interest.
Some argue that the Next Big Thing may not be big at all, but rather a diffuse process of innovation unleashed on established areas of the economy, one that extracts greater value by improving goods and services we already use every day. Traffic-choked cities may be liberated with modernized public transportation. Homes may be made more comfortable with advances in furnishing. The great American capacity to engineer solutions to life's problems -- still intact -- may need only the right policies to flourish again.
"There's a lot of opportunities for change in existing industries," says Joe Cortright, an economist at Impresa, a consulting firm in Portland, Ore., where traditional agriculture has in recent years evolved into boutique wineries and specialty-vegetable growers, extracting far greater value.
We are only now beginning to emerge from the longest recession since the Great Depression. The economy remains alarmingly lean. Yet many see in this moment an opportunity to refocus on areas of economic strength.
This month, amid reports that businesses were beginning to receive new orders, Dorothy Thomas was still living in a homeless shelter, unemployed.
Before the end of the month, she will reach the shelter's time limit and be forced to move again. Yet, a new confidence was evident in her words. After nearly two years of rejection and terrifying proximity to the streets, she had tapped back into a deep resilience. She had polished her resume, acquired a penchant for saving and secured transportation. All that sat between her desperation and renewal was an item that -- in the traditional American narrative -- was supposed to be available to anyone willing to work: a paycheck.
"A job," Ms. Thomas said, "is really all I need."

Full text: The United States and the other major powers have given Iran until late September to begin substantive negotiations on restraining its nuclear program. And Tehran has now announced that it is ready to resume talks, and the Obama administration says it is ready, too. Unfortunately, there is no sign that Iran is serious about doing much more than buying more time.
On Wednesday, Tehran presented a proposed agenda with vague suggestions about dealing with global issues -- there is a lot to discuss, including Afghanistan -- but insisted that the file on its nuclear efforts is closed.
In the seven years since its covert nuclear fuel program was revealed, Iran has managed to split the world powers and deflect any real punishment by promising to talk. It continues to defy a United Nations Security Council order to stop producing nuclear fuel and has largely shrugged off three sets of watered-down sanctions that either failed to target Iran's economic vulnerabilities or were listlessly enforced -- especially by Russia and China.
American and European officials say they are now developing a more persuasive list of sanctions if Tehran continues to resist; a ban on new energy investment in Iran and a possible cutoff of gasoline exports to Iran are two leading possibilities. If Washington and Europe cannot get Russia and the Security Council to go along, they must be ready to move on their own this time.
Most experts agree the Iran has already produced enough low-enriched uranium for at least one bomb, but they disagree -- often vigorously -- on how close Iran is to building an actual weapon. There is almost no disagreement on Iran's ultimate goal. Even the top nuclear inspector for the United Nations, Mohamed ElBaradei, who too often gives Iran the benefit of the doubt, has acknowledged a "gut feeling" that Tehran wants the technology to build a bomb.
Iran's economy is vulnerable. Unemployment and inflation are high; foreign investment is low. Banking sanctions imposed by the United Nations and separately by the United States and Europe have had some bite. The incentives package on offer from the major powers -- including an end to diplomatic isolation and carefully monitored cooperation on peaceful nuclear energy -- should be re-emphasized. Iranians need to see that there is a real choice.
Iran's stolen presidential elections and the brutal crackdown that followed has deepened fissures in Iranian society and complicated engagement. But President Obama is right to remain open to broader talks.
That is not meant to legitimize the government. If done deftly, it could undercut the mullahs' attempts to blame the United States for their own failures and make clear the price of continued obstructionism.
There is not a lot of time left for the world to forge a common position. The negative rumblings out of Russia -- which is again playing down the need for sanctions -- are disturbing. We are seriously worried about the growing drumbeat in Israel for military action.
An attack on Iran would be a disaster. So would allowing Iran to build a nuclear weapon. The United States should never have to choose between those two disastrous courses. If diplomacy shows promise, it should continue. But if Iran is playing the same old game, the major powers must be ready to impose a real economic price this time.

Full text: In the recession, the nation's poverty rate climbed to 13.2 percent last year, up from 12.5 percent in 2007, according to an annual report released Thursday by the Census Bureau. The report also documented a decline in employer-provided health insurance and in coverage for adults.
The rise in the poverty rate, to the highest level since 1997, portends even larger increases this year, which has registered far higher unemployment than in 2008, economists said.
The bureau said 39.8 million residents last year lived below the poverty line, defined as an income of $22,025 for a family of four.
In another sign of both the recession and the long-term stagnation of middle-class wages, median family incomes in 2008 fell to $50,300, compared with $52,200 the year before. This wiped out the income gains of the previous three years, the report said.
Adjusted for inflation, in fact, median family incomes were lower in 2008 than a decade earlier.
"This is the largest decline in the first year of a recession we've seen since the Census Bureau started collecting data after World War II," said Lawrence Katz, an economist at Harvard University, referring to household incomes. "We've seen a lost decade for the typical American family."
The share of American residents who said they lacked health insurance throughout the entire year remained steady, at 15.4 percent, or 46.3 million people. But the total masked some more worrisome trends that are helping to drive the debate over a national health care overhaul.
Continuing an eight-year trend, the number of people with private or employer-sponsored insurance declined, while the number of people relying on government insurance programs including Medicare, Medicaid, the children's insurance program and military insurance rose.
The share of children who were uninsured declined, to 9.9 percent from 11 percent in 2007, apparently because of the federal government's special efforts to insure low-income children. But at the same time, the share of adults aged 18 to 64 without health insurance rose, to 20.3 percent in 2008 from 19.6 percent in 2007.
In a speech Thursday to promote his health care overhaul, President Obama referred to the census survey and said that things had grown worse since September 2008. "Over the last 12 months, it's estimated that the ranks of the uninsured have swelled by nearly six million people," he said.
The accuracy of the census numbers, which are collected each spring for the previous year as part of the Current Population Survey, is subject to debate. Family incomes in the poverty area do not include the value of food stamps, money received through tax credits or unreported income. On the other side, the poverty threshold has not been adjusted over the years to reflect the rising relative costs of housing and medical care and does not take account of large regional differences in the cost of living.
Whatever the flaws, which remain similar every year, "we think the C.P.S. data present a very good measure of the trends over time," David S. Johnson, chief of the housing and household economic statistics division of the Census Bureau, said Thursday in an audio news conference.
Because unemployment has climbed so much more sharply in 2009 -- averaging 9 percent, compared with an average of 5.8 percent in 2008 -- "the real spike in poverty is going to be in the '09 numbers, which we get next year," said Sheldon Danziger, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan and co-editor, with Maria Cancian, of the coming book "Changing Poverty, Changing Policies" (Russell Sage Foundation).

Abstract: Mr. Grimmett's report stated that the growth of weapons sales by the United States was "extraordinary" in a time of global recession and resulted from new arms deals as well as the sustained cost of maintenance, upgrades, ammunition and spare parts to nations that bought American weapons in the past.

Full text: Despite a recession that knocked down global arms sales last year, the United States expanded its role as the world's leading weapons supplier, increasing its share to more than two-thirds of all foreign armaments deals, according to a new Congressional study.
The United States signed weapons agreements valued at $37.8 billion in 2008, or 68.4 percent of all business in the global arms bazaar, up significantly from American sales of $25.4 billion the year before.
Italy was a distant second, with $3.7 billion in worldwide weapons sales in 2008, while Russia was third with $3.5 billion in arms sales last year -- down considerably from the $10.8 billion in weapons deals signed by Moscow in 2007.
The growth in weapons sales by the United States last year was particularly noticeable against worldwide trends. The value of global arms sales in 2008 was $55.2 billion, a drop of 7.6 percent from 2007 and the lowest total for international weapons agreements since 2005.
The increase in American weapons sales around the world "was attributable not only to major new orders from clients in the Near East and in Asia, but also to the continuation of significant equipment and support services contracts with a broad-based number of U.S. clients globally," according to the study, titled "Conventional Arms Transfers to Developing Nations."
The annual report was produced by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, a division of the Library of Congress. Regarded as the most detailed collection of unclassified global arms sales data available to the general public, it was delivered to the House and Senate on Friday, ready for members' return from the Labor Day recess.
The overall decline in weapons sales worldwide in 2008 can be explained by the reluctance of many nations to place new arms orders "in the face of the severe international recession," wrote Richard F. Grimmett, a specialist in international security at the Congressional Research Service and author of the study.
Mr. Grimmett's report stated that the growth of weapons sales by the United States was "extraordinary" in a time of global recession and resulted from new arms deals as well as the sustained cost of maintenance, upgrades, ammunition and spare parts to nations that bought American weapons in the past.
In the highly competitive global arms market, nations vie for both profit and political influence through weapons sales, in particular to developing nations, which remain "the primary focus of foreign arms sales activity by weapons suppliers," according to the study.
Weapons sales to developing nations reached $42.2 billion in 2008, only a nominal increase from the $41.1 billion in 2007.
The United States was the leader not only in arms sales worldwide, but also in sales to nations in the developing world, signing $29.6 billion in weapons agreements with these nations, or 70.1 percent of all such deals.
The study found that the larger arms deals concluded by the United States with developing nations last year included a $6.5 billion air defense system for the United Arab Emirates, a $2.1 billion jet fighter deal with Morocco and a $2 billion attack helicopter agreement with Taiwan. Other large weapons agreements were reached between the United States and India, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, South Korea and Brazil.
Russia was far behind in 2008 with $3.3 billion in weapons sales to the developing world, about 7.8 percent of all such agreements. The report says that while Russia continues to have China and India as its main weapons clients, Russia's new focus is on arms sales to Latin American nations, in particular to Venezuela.
France was third with $2.5 billion in arms sales to developing nations, or about 5.9 percent of weapons deals with these countries.
The top buyers in the developing world in 2008 were the United Arab Emirates, which signed $9.7 billion in arms deals; Saudi Arabia, which signed $8.7 billion in weapons agreements; and Morocco, with $5.4 billion in arms purchases.
The study uses figures in 2008 dollars, with amounts for previous years adjusted for inflation to give a constant financial measurement.

Full text: Finance ministers of the largest industrial countries vowed on Saturday to keep their multitrillion-dollar stimulus efforts in place, but at a meeting here they failed to agree on any firm limits on bankers' bonuses, a sign of the deep rifts that remain between American and European leaders.
The ministers did agree on a blueprint to raise capital requirements at banks to strengthen the world financial system as the recovery takes hold, a major goal of the United States Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner.
Regarding the higher capital requirements, Mr. Geithner said here that his goal was to reach a final agreement on the new standards by the end of next year.
Mr. Geithner added that while concerted action by central banks and governments had "pulled the global economy back from the edge of abyss," he added that "conditions for a sustained recovery led by private demand are not yet established."
The ministers agreed on broad principles to reform bankers' compensation, including an emphasis on rewarding long-term performance, but asked the Financial Stability Board, an international regulatory body, to come up with specific recommendations on bonuses to be presented at a Group of 20 summit meeting to be held in three weeks in Pittsburgh.
In its final communique, the G-20 ministers called for "global standards on pay structure," emphasizing long-term results in awarding pay and urging provisions to take back bonuses if bank profits tumble, known as "clawbacks." They also suggested limits on guaranteed bonuses.
That was a setback for French and German ministers who had been pushing hard in recent weeks for a more concrete plan to address bonuses, amid rising public anger that just months after they were rescued, major financial institutions are returning to old habits and rewarding executives who take excessive risks.
In Europe, where Germany's chancellor, Angela Merkel, is running for re-election later this month and the British prime minister, Gordon Brown, faces a general election within the next year, bonuses have been met with controversy.
While bonuses are still a contentious issue in the United States, they have been overtaken recently by the debate over health care reform. Negotiations between the American and European delegations over bonuses grew tense Friday night, according to one official who insisted on anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly.
He said the European negotiators felt their American counterparts were seeking to sidestep the bonus issue out of fear the White House could be accused of yielding too easily to European pressure, which might endanger progress on health care reform.
Mr. Geithner has been cool to proposals to restrict bonuses, instead emphasizing the need for higher capital requirements at banks and other broader regulatory measures to prevent a repeat of the financial crisis that began almost exactly a year ago with the collapse of Lehman Brothers.
The French finance minister, Christine Lagarde, tried to put the best face on the limited recommendations. "We argued very hard and very convincingly," she said. "We've agreed that the F.S.B. will come back to Pittsburgh with proposals on remuneration."
She added: "Bonuses are quite outrageous, and we can't let that continue."
The tone of the meeting, a precursor to the meeting in Pittsburgh, suggested that although the worst of the global financial panic had passed, politicians and economists remained deeply concerned about still-rising unemployment.
"The classic errors of economic policy during crises are that governments tend to act too late with insufficient force and then put the brakes on too early," Mr. Geithner said. "We are not going to repeat those mistakes."
With economic growth resuming in France and Germany last quarter, there has been increasing talk in Europe about a so-called exit strategy -- how to unwind the trillions of dollars in central bank lending and increased government spending without sending the global economy back into free fall.
But even German officials, who have been wary of the risk of inflation posed by widening deficits on both sides of the Atlantic, agreed in London that it was still too early to withdraw government support of the financial system.
"Everyone is convinced that we have to support the financial markets by all measures and stimulus packages which are necessary," said the German finance minister, Peer Steinbruck.
Other top financial officials echoed the view that it was still too early to celebrate about signs of growth.
"I was afraid a few weeks ago when we began to have good figures that it might induce an attitude that the crisis is over," said Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund. "It's not the time to implement exit strategies."
Britain's chancellor of the Exchequer, Alistair Darling, said members of the G-20 "have to make sure that we finish the job we started." He added: "There is still a lot of risk, a lot of uncertainty and a lot of obstacles to negotiate."

President Obama's Health Choices

Abstract: Mr. Obama needs to highlight the concerns that got many people agitating for government help in the first place -- the rising premiums and co-payments required for their health insurance policies, and the likelihood that, if forced to buy insurance on their own, perhaps after losing a job, they would be unable to afford it or even be denied coverage because of pre-existing conditions.

Full text: President Obama's address to Congress about health care reform on Wednesday is the moment for him to stand tough for a large and comprehensive plan. This is no time to yield on core elements of reform or on the scale of the effort in search of enough Republican support to provide the veneer of bipartisanship, or even the one or two Republican votes needed to overcome a filibuster.
As a political tactic, Mr. Obama has thus far simply issued broad principles for reform and left it to Congress to flesh out the details, leaving great uncertainty as to what reforms he considers essential. Given the raucous, often ill-informed attacks on Democratic proposals over the past month, and the clear aim of most Republicans to oppose any bill, no matter how much he compromises, Mr. Obama now needs to spell out in some detail what he wants and how it would benefit both the uninsured and most other Americans as well.
Mr. Obama needs to highlight the concerns that got many people agitating for government help in the first place -- the rising premiums and co-payments required for their health insurance policies, and the likelihood that, if forced to buy insurance on their own, perhaps after losing a job, they would be unable to afford it or even be denied coverage because of pre-existing conditions.
At a minimum, we believe Mr. Obama should declare himself in favor of covering as many of the uninsured as possible in the near future; should insist that insurers grant and renew coverage without regard to health status; and should insist on new insurance exchanges in which people without group coverage and those working for the smallest employers could buy insurance at large-group rates.
Despite calls from Republicans that he jettison support for a new public plan to compete with private plans on those exchanges, he should not do so now. If he decides to bargain it away later, he should insist, minimally, that a strong public plan be introduced if private insurers fail to hold costs down in the future.
We are alarmed at reports that the price for winning over Republicans and conservative Democrats might be a drastically scaled-down plan that would cost not $1 trillion over 10 years but perhaps only $700 billion or much less. That big a reduction would be a mistake. The insurance reforms that people most want -- and the insurance industry is willing to accept -- depend on achieving near universal coverage to spread the risks over a large group of healthy and unhealthy people.
The big costs of reform involve expanding Medicaid to cover more of the poor and providing subsidies to help those with low or modest incomes buy insurance on the new exchanges. Scaling down too far would most likely result in subsidies too limited to really help people. Imagine the backlash if millions of Americans were required to carry insurance and found they could not afford to buy it.
The other major element of reform is slowing the rise in medical costs while improving quality. Mr. Obama should say whether he believes pending bills need an extra dose of cost-cutting reforms, or pilot projects, in Medicare. Nobody in either party has a sure-fire solution to rein in medical inflation. Mr. Obama should insist on an independent commission to monitor reforms, expand those that work and drop those that do not.
If Mr. Obama is reaching out for broader support, he may be too diplomatic to point out the cynicism of Republican opponents who are late-blooming advocates of deficit reduction. The Bush administration and a Republican-controlled Congress enacted a Medicare prescription drug benefit that will cost the government almost $1 trillion over the next decade without raising or saving a penny to pay for it.
They also passed tax cuts for wealthy Americans that will cost more than $1.7 trillion over 10 years, again without making provisions to offset the costs. Now they are complaining that $1 trillion for health care reform -- fully paid for over the next 10 years -- is too much to spend on a problem that has been festering for decades.
Rather than yield to Republican intransigence, the Democrats ought to resort to a parliamentary maneuver known as "budget reconciliation," which would allow them to push through most reforms by majority vote.

Abstract: [...] your dentist also routinely looks for more serious problems, like oral cancer.

Full text: MUCH has been said and written about the tens of millions of Americans without health insurance. But often overlooked in these discussions is another vital medical statistic: more than 100 million Americans go without dental coverage.
Many employer-sponsored health care plans do not include dental insurance, and those that do will typically offer only limited benefits. Individual private insurance is often too costly to be feasible. And Medicaid and Medicare offer only limited safety nets.
For most people, a toothache that turns into an expensive procedure like a crown or implant means thousands of dollars out of pocket. Routine checkups, cleanings and fillings can set you back hundreds. No wonder 35 percent of Americans have not visited a dentist in the last 12 months, according to a Gallup report in March.
Even if you're fortunate enough to have some kind of coverage, you have probably discovered just how little it pays if you have big problems. Most dental policies pay for preventive care like twice-a-year checkups, but cover only a fraction of higher-cost procedures like root canals. Even fillings can get short-changed, if the insurer decides the tooth-colored filler the dentist used was too "cosmetic" for the pothole being patched.
At the same time, dental care costs are rising faster than inflation, just as the evidence mounts that taking care of your mouth can be a critical gateway to good overall health.
The health care bills circulating in the House and Senate include dental care provisions for children, which is good. But it also means that for most of us relief from dental bills is not likely to come soon. That leaves it up to consumers to find smart ways to reduce their dental care costs without sacrificing their oral health. So we asked experts and patients for advice.
PREVENTION Taking care of small problems keeps them from becoming big ones. Enough cannot be said about prevention, according to Dr. Matthew Messina, consumer adviser for the American Dental Association and a dentist in Cleveland.
Left unchecked, a small cavity that would cost about $100 to fill can easily turn into a $1,000 root canal. Skip those $80 cleanings each year, and you may be looking at $2,000 worth of gum disease treatments. An abscess that lands you in the emergency room will set you back hundreds of dollars for the visit, "and you'll still have to go see a dentist, because emergency rooms don't handle dental work," said Dr. Messina.
Finally, your dentist also routinely looks for more serious problems, like oral cancer. More than 35,000 cases are diagnosed each year, according to the American Cancer Society. Early detection, usually during a dental checkup, is critical to successful treatment.
FULL DISCLOSURE It's important to know the price before you agree to the procedure. Often patients sit down for a routine cleaning and checkup, only to find they have a problem. The dentist offers to take care of the situation on the spot, and the patient agrees -- but then is socked with a surprising bill at the end of the visit.
That happened to Monica Gagnier of Beacon, N.Y., on a recent visit to her Manhattan dentist for a twice-yearly cleaning. Looking to save money, Ms. Gagnier was careful to tell the office when she made the appointment that she wasn't due to get X-rays and didn't need to see the dentist for a checkup. Without those two items, she figured she would save more than $100 on her bill.
During the cleaning, however, the hygienist told her that her gums were infected and she needed antibiotic shots. Her total bill was $400.
"The antibiotics may well have been necessary," Ms. Gagnier said. "But what I hate is being hit by surprise costs and treatments when I'm lying on my back, my mouth is wide open, and I can't talk about it."
You should always be given an opportunity to discuss any treatment, sitting up, without equipment in your mouth, says Dr. Messina. In addition, whenever you are facing an invasive dental procedure that is not an emergency, it makes sense to refuse treatment on the spot and get a second opinion, says Elizabeth Rogers, a spokeswoman for Oral Health America, a nonprofit advocacy and education group based in Chicago.
The range of prices on treatments like root canals, for instance, can easily differ by $1,000 or more.
SPREADING THE COST Patients can often space out treatments or negotiate payment plans with the dentist for extensive work. Working with the dentist on payments, says Dr. Mark Wolff, associate dean at the New York University College of Dentistry, is much better than putting the bill on your credit card and paying high interest.
Another way to negotiate, says Dr. Wolff, is to plan extensive treatments in phases. Say you need a crown. Your dentist may be able to put in a temporary filling for several months while you use that time to save for the permanent crown.
"It's quite possible to phase in many dental procedures," said Dr. Wolff. "And when it is, most dentists are willing to spread the work out over time."
DENTAL SCHOOL CLINICS Almost every dental school offers affordable care provided by dental students and overseen by experienced, qualified teachers. You can expect to pay as little as a third of what a traditional dentist would charge and still receive excellent, well-supervised care, Dr. Wolff says.
That is what Julie Kingsley of Portland, Me., did after a checkup for her two young children at a pediatric dentist set her back a total of $375. "I realized that was as much as a car payment or a good chunk of our monthly food bill," said Ms. Kingsley. "There had to be a better way."
Ms. Kingsley started asking around for less expensive alternatives and found out about the University of New England's dental college clinic, at the Westbrook campus in Portland. The bill for her children's latest checkups: $100.
Ms. Kingsley was pleased with the quality of care her children received. But she did warn that patients may sacrifice time for money. "What was a 45-minute visit at the private dentist ended up taking three hours at the clinic," she said.
If you have trouble finding a dental clinic in your area, you can seek help from Oral Health America (oralhealthamerica.org or 312-836-9900).
Many communities also subsidize low-cost dental clinics that offer free services to those who qualify, or charge fees on a sliding scale. To find a clinic in your area, you can check with your state's dental director. A state-by-state list is on the Web site of the Association of State and Territorial Dental Directors, at bit.ly/kCCo7.
DISCOUNT NETWORKS Alternatives to employer-provided dental insurance are often a bad deal, Dr. Wolff said. But for the uninsured, a discount network can make a difference.
Some networks like those on DentalPlans.com have formed to fill the void. Consumers pay roughly $100 to $200 a year in exchange for 15 to 50 percent discounts on service and treatments from participating dentists. "Be sure to compare plans carefully," said Ms. Rogers of Oral Health America.
And, she added, make sure the discounts you are likely to use will be enough to cover the annual fee -- and look carefully for any limits and restrictions.

Full text: If you have paid a college tuition bill recently, perhaps the sticker shock has abated and your children have been good enough to friend you on Facebook so you can see what they are doing on your dime.
What probably still lingers, however, is the desire to ask some pointed questions of the people who are doing the educating. Where does all that money go? And why can't the price tag fall for a change?
Earlier this year, the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities announced with some pride that the average increase in tuition and fees at private institutions this school year would be the smallest in 37 years -- 4.3 percent, just a little higher than inflation.
Is this where we are supposed to stand up and cheer?
To get some perspective, I set out to find a college president with an M.B.A. and some experience outside the academy. I found one at Lafayette College in Easton, Pa. Its president, Daniel H. Weiss, is an expert in medieval art, but he also worked as a management consultant at Booz Allen Hamilton. So he knows his way around a corporate restructuring.
Lafayette does not have the strongest name recognition and tries to set itself apart through its location near both New York City and Philadelphia, its strong engineering program and liberal arts offerings, and by being one of the smallest colleges to compete in N.C.A.A. Division I athletics.
That it is not a top-tier college by most measures, however, makes Lafayette an excellent test case as it and other private colleges cross the $50,000 annual cost threshold in shaky economic times.
Public universities will always appeal on price, and Wellesley and Harvard are likely to remain oversubscribed forever. But Lafayette and colleges like it could have trouble justifying themselves and their cost soon, and the resistance may not simply pass once the economy improves.
Tuition costs have gone in only one direction -- up -- during Mr. Weiss's career. "I genuinely believe that we are at a crossroads here in higher education," he said. "I think we have reached a ceiling that we're beginning to bump into."
Mr. Weiss has not had to make any drastic budget cuts so far. He has frozen many salaries, cut some hours in the student dining halls and scaled back a few building projects.
This will seem rather tame to anyone who has lived through even a medium-grade corporate revamping. "We haven't been good at cutting when we add," said Robert Massa, Lafayette's new vice president for communications, speaking of colleges in general. "We just add."
Rising tuition and income from endowments have made this possible. But the unique structure of universities has also made it inconvenient to do otherwise. "In some ways, higher education is more like a political environment than the management of a private corporation," Mr. Weiss said. Except that thanks to tenure, it is difficult to vote anyone out of office. Still, he added, "Alienating some of your faculty members, if you can avoid it, is something you shouldn't be doing."
This is just one of the reasons why it is so hard to make big cuts to a college's budget and reduce tuition in turn. Here are some others:
CUTTING DEPARTMENTS The political challenges with faculty make something as seemingly simple and obvious as cutting expensive and undersubscribed academic departments pretty hard. In fact, Mr. Weiss could not remember the last time Lafayette had done such a thing.
But such cuts are practically inevitable for programs that have fewer students. "Fine arts has studio-based production, so capital and facility costs are high," said Jane Wellman, executive director of the nonprofit group Delta Project on Postsecondary Education Costs, Productivity and Accountability, speaking of colleges in general. "Piano tutoring is pretty much one to one in a room with a piano. Pianos are expensive. Agriculture is expensive because of the lab costs, which means a barn."
An English student, however, is generally a profit center. "They're paying for the chemistry major and the music major and faculty research," she said. "They don't want to talk about it in institutions, because the English department gets mad. The little ugly facts about cross-subsidies are inflammatory, so they get papered over."
About all Mr. Weiss will say about this is that he agrees that Lafayette needs to do a better job of discriminating between the things it can and cannot do well. He is too good on the politics to single out any department. But there is little doubt that he and administrators like him will need to give up on some foreign languages, minor sciences or parts of the arts pretty soon.
FACULTY PRODUCTIVITY Professors at Lafayette teach five classes a year over two semesters and work with students on their independent research projects. At some colleges and universities, the number of classes is lower and at others it is higher. Couldn't Lafayette lower costs by demanding that the faculty perform less research and teach one additional class?
"The question is what is the quality of that interaction," Mr. Weiss said. "Our faculty must have the opportunity to revitalize their teaching through research. If you're teaching the same old course the same old way every year, you're not keeping up with the discipline and not able to animate your own teaching with that experience."
Not every academic agrees. "Am I, for example, as a tenured professor or any tenured faculty member necessarily, or even probably, a better undergraduate teacher because I am doing research?" asked Burton A. Weisbrod, co-author of "Mission and Money: Understanding the University" and an economics professor at Northwestern. "The answer to that is not clear at all."
Nevertheless, Lafayette is so certain in its convictions that it grants faculty members a year off every six or seven years for a sabbatical. How does a college defend such a practice to parents who have had to work ever harder to pay the growing tuition bill?
"What parents should be looking for is the opportunity for their children to have their lives transformed by what happens inside the classroom and out of it," Mr. Weiss said. And that cannot come, he continued, without access to faculty members who have had the opportunity to recharge their own intellectual reservoirs. "At the end of the day, parents should want their children to have that experience, and we believe that's the cost of it."
Still, parents are helping to subsidize those sabbaticals. So the optics around this are all wrong in the current economic environment, even if this is one of those things no one can change.
ADMINISTRATIVE OVERLOAD Lafayette, like many colleges, spends more on nonfaculty salaries than it does on pay for the teachers. How did that happen? Mr. Weiss uses the evolution of career counseling as an example. He does not recall whether there was a placement office when he was an undergraduate at George Washington University in the 1970s. "Now there is the expectation, and I don't think it's misplaced, that students can get help in entering the workplace," he said. If Lafayette did not create a rigorous support system, he noted, its graduates would be competing with students from other colleges and universities that had done so. "And therefore, we've invested very significantly in new administrative staff."
Security is another area where costs have gone up. Just a quick glance at a dormitory bulletin board gives a sense of the breadth of what security departments deal with thesedays. One posting offered detailed instructions on what to do when encountering a bat, and an eye-opening piece of literature called "Active Shooter Survival Tips." (Yes, I have linked to it from the online version of this story.)
THREE YEARS Perhaps the biggest cost-saving measure for private colleges like Lafayette would be to allow students to pay the same price per year but graduate in three years instead of four. Hartwick College in New York is already trying this; 13 students have signed on this fall.
Mr. Weiss said this is worth considering, though he had not looked at how the numbers would work. "Although without sounding in any way defensive, we also do offer time for personal development," he explained. "And that is part of what college is supposed to be. Not only to learn stuff but to have your life changed. For some students, three years is more than enough, while for others four years is not nearly enough."
He's right, of course. Or at least that is how college used to be. The question all of us have to ask now is whether the price of that transformative experience is simply too dear -- and whether a basic education ought to be the highest (or maybe only) priority.

Abstract: If I were magically given an hour to help Barack Obama prepare for his health care speech next week, the first thing I'd do is ask him to read David Goldhill's essay, "How American Health Care Killed My Father," in the current issue of The Atlantic. Goldhill is especially good on the way the voracious health care system soaks up money that could go to education, the environment, economic development and a thousand other priorities.

Full text: If I were magically given an hour to help Barack Obama prepare for his health care speech next week, the first thing I'd do is ask him to read David Goldhill's essay, "How American Health Care Killed My Father," in the current issue of The Atlantic. That essay would lift Obama out of the distracting sideshows about this public plan or that cooperative option. It would remind him why he got into this issue in the first place.
Goldhill's main message is that the American health care system is dysfunctional at the core. He vividly describes how the system hides information, muddies choices, encourages more treatment instead of better care, neglects cheap innovation, inflates costs and unintentionally increases suffering.
The essay is about the real problem: the insane incentives. Goldhill is especially good on the way the voracious health care system soaks up money that could go to education, the environment, economic development and a thousand other priorities. Health care, he writes, "simply keeps gobbling up national resources, seemingly without regard to other societal needs."
Then I'd ask Obama to go to the Brookings Institution Web site and read a report called "Bending the Curve: Effective Steps to Address Long-Term Health Care Spending Growth." This report was written by a bipartisan group of battle-tested experts, including Mark McClellan, David Cutler, Elizabeth McGlynn, Joseph Antos and John Bertko.
This report also focuses on the key issue: perverse incentives. It's got a series of proposals on how to restructure insurance markets, reorganize provider payments, change the way effectiveness-research findings are implemented and cap the employee tax deduction.
These aren't pie-in-the-sky ideas. The authors have combed through the bills that are already out there. They've taken good ideas that are now in embryonic or neutered form. They show how the ideas would work if fully implemented. We're not going to revolutionize 18 percent of the American economy overnight, but these proposals would put us on the path toward real reform.
We're not on that path right now. Several months ago, President Obama made a promise: People with health insurance would be able to keep exactly what they have.
We all understand why he made that promise. He wanted to reassure people who are happy with what they've got. He wanted to mollify the industries that have a vested interest in the status quo.
But Obama's promise sent the reform effort off the rails. It meant that efforts to expand coverage marched ahead, but efforts to fundamentally reform the system got watered down.
Instead of true reform we got a series of bills that essentially cement the present system in place. The proposals do not fundamentally challenge the fee-for-service system. They don't make Americans more accountable for their own health care spending. They don't reduce costs. They just add more people into the mess we've got.
The president made this promise to ease passage. But it ended up hollowing out the substance of the reform. And the political benefits didn't even materialize. Voters are still spooked by the costs, the centralization and the cuts they are sure will come.
If I had a magic hour with the president, I'd tell him this is his ninth-inning chance. He can stay on the current path. He might be able to pass some incremental bill that extends coverage. But he won't have tackled the fundamental problems that first drove him to this issue. He won't have cut health care inflation. He won't have prevented a voracious system from bankrupting the nation, defunding the schools, pushing down wages and impoverishing the young.
On the other hand, he can shift back to the core issue: the perverse incentives that make this system such a mess. He can embrace proposals--like the Brookings proposals or, more comprehensively, the Wyden-Bennett bill -- that address the structural problems instead of simply papering over them.
This remains a politically risky strategy. There are many industries that have an interest in making sure health care spending rises to 20 percent of G.D.P., and then 22 and then 24. But the president's in political hot water already. He got there trying to dodge the hard issues. He might as well be there because he's fighting for something real.
There are many people telling him to go incremental. They're telling him to just enlarge the current system a bit and pay for it by pounding down a few Medicare fees. But did Barack Obama really get elected so he could pass the Status Quo Sanctification and Extension Act?
This is not the time to get incremental. It's the time to get fundamental. Reform the incentives. Make consumers accountable for spending. Make price information transparent. Reward health care, not health services. Do what you set out to do. Bring change.

Full text: Six months after the financial world seemed to be coming to an end, the world's economies appear to be recovering. Banks that seemed to be on the brink of failure less than a year ago are now able to pay back investments made by the Treasury.
It is too early to declare victory, but the world looks much safer than it did only a few months ago. Credit markets are recovering, to the point that the junk bond market will have its best year ever if it manages not to lose any money over the rest of 2009. The stock market has just finished its best six months since 1938.
If victory is to be had, it will owe a lot to the willingness of American policy makers to set aside cherished policies and simply create money. And that is one reason it is appropriate to pause and celebrate an unheralded bicentennial: The father of the greenback, Elbridge Gerry Spaulding, who was born 200 years ago, in 1809.
Spaulding was that rarest of creatures, a man who succeeded in both business and politics; a congressman who saw a problem coming and had a solution ready. It was he who, at the end of 1861, figured out that the American government simply needed to print money to pay for the Civil War. It was economic heresy then, but without it this country might not have survived.
Such an idea was then dismissed by some as "fiat money," money that is money not because it is backed by gold or silver, but because some government says it is money.
That such currencies can fail to work is obvious, as those who lived in Weimar Germany or present-day Zimbabwe have found out. But notwithstanding those examples, the last 20 years deserve to be remembered as the age of fiat money. For much of that time, central bankers were revered as heroes for engineering long booms and short, shallow recessions.
Ben S. Bernanke, the current chairman of the Federal Reserve, sometimes does not seem to understand that this reputation has taken a hit. After he warned that "a perceived loss of monetary-policy independence" could lead to "reduced economic and financial stability," he drew a taunting comment from Dean Baker, an economist with the Center for Economic Policy and Research in Washington.
"Maybe Mr. Bernanke missed it," wrote Mr. Baker, "but his independent Fed gave us the largest financial and economic crisis since the Great Depression. Does anyone really think that things would have been worse if the Fed had been more accountable?"
Mr. Bernanke did not miss it, of course. He may have been slow to realize how critical the situation was, but when he did, he acted decisively. Like Spaulding almost 150 years ago, he showed a willingness to abandon the wisdom of an earlier time. The government lent money it did not have to financial institutions, and bought stock in them.
The Federal Reserve expanded its balance sheet to an unprecedented extent, and seemed to be guaranteeing almost everything in sight. Given how closely the Fed worked with the Bush and Obama administrations, it may not have reinforced its reputation for independence, but it was certainly a pioneer in innovation.
Today Spaulding is largely forgotten. Civil war generals are remembered with monuments and even colleges; Spaulding has a dormitory named for him at the University of Buffalo.
But some deem him a hero. "If Wall Street had saints, then the college of financial cardinals would surely canonize Elbridge G. Spaulding," wrote T. J. Stiles in his insightful new biography of Cornelius Vanderbilt, "The First Tycoon."
Spaulding, wrote Mr. Stiles, "performed a true miracle: he conjured money out of nothing, and so contributed more toward the Union victory (and the future of New York's financial sector) than any single battlefield victory."
How did he do that? A congressman from Buffalo, and a banker before and after he was a politician, he was chairman of a House Ways and Means subcommittee when the government was in danger of running out of money to pay for the Civil War. He wrote a law that allowed the government to print money and declare it had to be accepted as legal tender.
Until then, the only circulating paper money was notes issued by banks. Those notes were supposed to be convertible into gold, although the banks had been forced to suspend such conversions at the end of 1861. There was no central bank.
To opponents, Spaulding's plan was simply immoral. "It will infinitely damage the national credit," warned Representative Justin S. Morrill of Vermont, adding that it was "a breach of the public faith" that would lead to rampant inflation.
"This fair fabric of our untarnished faith and unbounded wealth and credit ought not to be destroyed," added Representative Valentine B. Horton of Ohio. "It will," forecast Representative Roscoe Conkling of New York, "proclaim throughout the country a saturnalia of fraud, a carnival for rogues."
The bill passed Congress not because anyone thought it was good policy absent a crisis, but because most thought it was necessary. Something very similar can be said about the government's multiple bailouts during this crisis.
In the end, Spaulding was proved right. "It was at once a loan to the government without interest and a national currency, which was so much needed for disbursement in small sums during the pressing exigencies of the war," he wrote years later in his book, "History of the Legal Tender Paper Money."
He even created a floating currency. Gold dollars still existed, and were the only dollars that could be used for international trade. When the war appeared to be going badly for the North, the value of the greenback sank. Someone with first knowledge of a Union victory could gain a quick profit by selling gold for greenbacks.
Contrary to the expectations of Representative Morrill, paper money did not set off sharp inflation over time, and when the paper money eventually was made convertible into gold, there were no lines of people wanting to trade in paper for bullion.
Mr. Bernanke's eventual reputation is likely to be determined by how well he succeeds in his vow to right the economy without prompting a major devaluation of the dollar.
Some doubt he can do it. "The Fed, which saw none of this coming, now asks us to believe that it will see clearly enough into the future to remove this massive monetary stimulus before it becomes harmful," said James Grant, the editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer.
If Mr. Bernanke does manage to accomplish that, he, like Elbridge Spaulding, will have earned financial canonization.

From Europe's Central Bank, Optimism Comes Tempered With a Warning

Abstract: The European Central Bank upgraded its growth outlook for the euro zone on Thursday, but sought to temper optimism by warning that the nascent economic recovery would be patchy. Since last month, data from the euro area has mostly been positive.

Full text: The European Central Bank upgraded its growth outlook for the euro zone on Thursday, but sought to temper optimism by warning that the nascent economic recovery would be patchy.
In another note of caution, the central bank president, Jean-Claude Trichet, also refused to specify when the bank might begin unwinding the extraordinary steps it took over the last year to support Europe's banking sector.
"Today it is not the time to exit, but we are alert, we are permanently looking at the situation," Mr. Trichet said at a news conference. "We have no pre-commitment in any respect."
The bank left its benchmark interest rate at 1 percent, where it has been since May, after a meeting of its governing council in Frankfurt. Mr. Trichet told a news conference that the decision had been unanimous, that current borrowing costs were "appropriate" and that "price developments are expected to remain subdued."
Over all, analysts concluded that the bank was in no hurry to reverse the measures it had taken -- including deep interest rate cuts and efforts to inject more cash into the system -- to stimulate the economy.
Still, on the same day that the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development gave a brighter outlookfor the world's major economies, the central bank lifted its own growth projections as well.
"There are increasing signs of stabilization in economic activity in the euro area and elsewhere," Mr. Trichet said. He cited the inventory cycle, a pickup in exports and the impact of fiscal and monetary stimulus.
The central bank now expects growth of 0.2 percent in the euro area next year. In June, it estimated a decline of 0.3 percent. The new figure is relatively conservative, compared with a market consensus of 0.8 percent.
Mr. Trichet did not exclude the possibility that growth could turn positive before mid-2010. But he was careful to say the recovery would be "very gradual" and "rather uneven," because some factors supporting growth were temporary and some banks and businesses were still repairing their balance sheets.
"Prudence and caution are of the essence in the present situation," he said.
Nick Kounis, the chief European economist at Fortis Bank in Amsterdam, said the day the central bank started to raise interest rates again still appeared "some way off."
"This is clearly a central bank that remains very cautious, and as a result, it wants to keep market interest rate expectations low," he said.
The central bank also slightly increased its inflation projections, based mainly on rising energy prices. It gave an inflation forecast of 0.4 percent this year and 1.2 percent next year. It aims to keep inflation at a rate below but close to 2 percent.
The sluggish rebound will serve to restrain price increases, Mr. Trichet said.
Hours earlier, the O.E.C.D., a Paris-based research institute, published improved economic forecasts for the industrialized economies, suggesting that the global recession might end as early as the third quarter.
It forecast that growth across the Group of 7 countries would contract 3.7 percent this year, less than the 4.1 percent decline projected in June. It offered slightly improved outlooks for Japan and the euro area, an unchanged projection for the United States and a gloomier assessment of Britain.
Since last month, data from the euro area has mostly been positive.
On Thursday, a release from Markit Economics showed that Europe's manufacturing and service industries ended in August the longest streak of contraction on record. A composite index of both industries rose to 50.4 in August, from 47 the previous month. The index is based on a survey of purchasing managers and a reading below 50 indicates a contraction.
This week, data showed the euro-zone economy shrank 0.1 percent in the second quarter from the first, a significant improvement over the record 2.5 percent plunge in the first three months of 2009.
Still, there has been no improvement in the labor market. On Thursday, the French statistics office Insee reported that unemployment rose to 9.5 percent in the second quarter, from 8.9 percent during the previous three months.
As part of its support for banks, the central bank has introduced so-called nonstandard measures, including one-year unlimited liquidity auctions. In June, 442 billion euros, or $630 billion, of cash was taken up by banks; the next auction is scheduled for Sept. 29.
Mr. Trichet called for further efforts from governments to strengthen the financial system.
"The worst possible attitude," now that financial markets are functioning better and prices are recovering, would be to return to "business as usual."
The central bank confirmed, as expected, that the rate on that refinancing operation would remain 1 percent, rather than being raised. Analysts said this also showed the bank was in no hurry to unwind its liquidity support for banks.
Separately, the Swedish central bank, the Riksbank, left its benchmark interest rate unchanged on Thursday, at 0.25 percent, while maintaining the view that borrowing costs would not rise before the third quarter of 2010.

Full text: Ominous Signals
From Bonds Data
The worst is over. At least until about a week ago, that was what most investors seemed to be thinking. Prices and hopes were rising with almost every statistical release and earnings report. But one important market has been stuck in a gloomier mood.
Government bond yields have fallen significantly in the last month or so: to 3.4 percent, from 3.9 percent, on 10-year notes in the United States; to 3.2 percent, from 3.7 percent, in the euro zone; and to 3.6 percent, from 4 percent, in Britain. That sort of decline sits uneasily with rising economic optimism.
Why? There are several theories.
One is the expectation of deflation or something like it. Japanese consumer prices are the same now as they were in 1993, when its financial bubble had fully burst. Even if future Western gross domestic product growth proves stronger than it has been in Japan -- an annual rate of 0.6 percent from 1993 to before the latest recession -- financial pressure could keep retail prices from rising. In that environment, a risk-free interest rate of 3 to 4 percent doesn't sound too bad.
Another explanation is more mechanical. Thanks to the "nearly free money" programs of central banks around the world, including some purchases of government-backed securities, there may be more buying power in the markets than can be absorbed by a record supply of new government debt, forcing prices up and yields down.
Finally, there is the dark future theory. Bond buyers may think investors in other markets, principally the stock exchanges, have misread the economic data. What looks like a recovery could actually be an inventory correction that will be followed by another recession. Therefore, government bonds would represent a safe haven.
Whatever is actually moving bond investors to push down yields, one thing is clear. If they are right, the world's financial woes are unlikely to be over. Either flat consumer prices or a new recession would make more loans go bad, straining bank and government balance sheets. Conversely, if excess money is piling up, the funds could easily push up other prices, creating another asset price bubble or a bout of uncomfortable inflation.
The bond market may be hard to read, but none of its signals look to be telling a happy story.
The Register Shrugged
Is libertarianism's flag-bearer about to become a welfare queen? The collapse of the media chain Freedom Communications, named in honor of the philosophy that its founder championed, makes it appear so. The sanctity of private contracts was an important tenet of its late founder, R. C. Hoiles. Filing for protection from creditors appears to fly in the face of all he stood for.
The owner of The Orange County Register of California and more than 100 other publications and television stations filed for bankruptcy protection on Tuesday after agreeing with lenders on a plan to restructure its $771 million in debt after its cash flow fell about 75 percent over the last five years.
Up until now, the company was run by Mr. Hoiles's heirs, who sought to uphold his fiery advocacy of libertarianism. But control will now pass to its lenders. Mr. Hoiles, who died in 1970, was an ardent fan of Ayn Rand and inspired free-marketeers like Alan Greenspan and Barry Goldwater. His successors even held seminars in the philosophy for Freedom's employees.
Mr. Hoiles's belief in limited government and individual responsibility informed his paper's editorial policies through the New Deal and Great Society programs he opposed. But Freedom was caught out more recently by the precipitous industrywide decline in advertising revenue.
Squaring libertarians' belief in individual responsibility and the sanctity of private contracts with a bankruptcy filing isn't easy. But lenders willingly, if implicitly, assume some credit risk by charging more for debt that falls further back in the payoff queue should a default occur. If the bankruptcy court divides the spoils accordingly, the sanctity of the contracts could be viewed as intact.
The intellectually unforgiving Mr. Hoiles would probably have little patience for such hairsplitting. But it might give his offspring some comfort.

Abstract: The grades -- which are designed to give parents a clear idea of how well a school is teaching their children, and are also used to help determine bonuses for principals and teachers -- have become one of the most contentious policies of Mr. Klein's tenure. Geoffrey Canada, the president of Harlem Children's Zone and a loyal ally of the Bloomberg administration, said the report cards helped show administrators and teachers where they needed to improve, but he questioned whether they made much sense to most parents.

Full text: The news could have been cause for a huge celebration: a whopping 97 percent of New York's elementary and middle schools earning an A or B on the city's annual report card. Yet Chancellor Joel I. Klein was tempered in his praise, careful to say that the high marks did not necessarily mean that the city was filled with excellent schools.
"We want to make clear that that means that they met their progress targets," Mr. Klein said, a tad defensively, at a news conference at Public School 189 in Washington Heights on Wednesday. "Not by any stretch of the imagination that those schools don't have a lot of improvement ahead of them."
At the same time, when asked if there was something wrong with a grading system in which nearly every school earned top marks -- 889 of the 1,058 graded schools got A's, and just two received F's -- he clearly took pride in the results. "If you're asking whether I would rather see less A's," he said, "the answer is no."
Last year, 38 percent of elementary and middle schools got A's and 41 percent B's; in 2007, the first year that schools were graded, 23 percent earned an A and 38 percent a B.
Suddenly, New York City looks like Lake Wobegon, where all the children are above average -- or like the Ivy League, noted for grade inflation that makes, say, a B-minus seem like the new F.
More than half the schools that received grades on Wednesday -- 550 of them -- did better this year than last year. Another 438 received the same marks; the vast majority already had A's. Forty schools saw their grades fall.
The grades -- which are designed to give parents a clear idea of how well a school is teaching their children, and are also used to help determine bonuses for principals and teachers -- have become one of the most contentious policies of Mr. Klein's tenure. They are primarily based on how much student test scores at each school improve from one year to the next, and rely heavily on comparing schools that have similar demographics.
The system uses a blunt letter grade to call attention to which schools are doing well and which are not. But on Wednesday, Mr. Klein urged parents to dig deeper, to look at the factors and underlying numbers used in the complicated formula that determines the grades. And he emphasized that the results did not necessarily mean that 97 percent of the schools were doing well.
The Bloomberg administration has made accountability the touchstone of its efforts to overhaul city schools. When the mayor and chancellor first released the reports in 2007, they said the grades would be vital in determining if a low-performing school should be closed. In the last two years, Mr. Klein has announced that he would close 28 schools, and he has tried to remove principals from other low-performing schools.
All of the schools that received F's last year and remained open received A's or B's this year. Of the schools that received D's last year, none earned lower than a C this year. And of the 393 schools that received A's last year, only three dropped below a B.
The United Federation of Teachers and a group of parents sued the Department of Education last year to block the closing of two schools in Harlem, Public Schools 194 and 241, and one in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn, P.S. 150. All three earned A's this year.
Asked if that meant there was something wrong with the closing process or with the grading system, Mr. Klein again grew defensive.
"I think there's nothing wrong with anything," he said. "I know we need to find something wrong here, but there's nothing wrong with anything. That is to say those schools -- and this is not atypical -- made progress this year. That's what the progress report reflects."
He said that when moving to close failing schools, the city considered other factors, such as student enrollment and whether parents were applying in large numbers to the school.
Two charter schools run by Harlem Children's Zone that have been praised by Mr. Klein, as well as by President Obama, received B's this year.
Geoffrey Canada, the president of Harlem Children's Zone and a loyal ally of the Bloomberg administration, said the report cards helped show administrators and teachers where they needed to improve, but he questioned whether they made much sense to most parents.
"I think they can be slightly misleading if they are taken at face value," Mr. Canada said. "If you're at a school where things are improving, you should feel good about that, but there are a lot of schools where you could have done really, really good last year, and just really good this year and you're getting a lower grade. So it's tricky."
Dozens of school districts from cities all over the country and as far away as Australia have worked with Education Department officials to replicate the grading system.
Daniel Koretz, a professor who focuses on testing and accountability issues at the Harvard School of Education, said it was hard to come to any clear conclusions about schools or the system by looking at the grades. It is even harder, he added, because so many questions have been raised about whether the state's math and reading tests had become easier in recent years.
"The agnostics are right: We just don't know what's going on right now," he said. "The problem is we are stuck with this. We really have no second measure."

Abstract: Even after the tough town-hall-style meetings, unrelenting Republican assaults and a steady stream of questions from anxious voters, interviews with more than a dozen Blue Dogs and their top aides indicate that many of the lawmakers still believe approval of some form of health care plan is achievable and far preferable to not acting at all.

Full text: CORRECTION: A map on Wednesday with an article about conservative Democrats' plans on health care gave an incorrect location for a district in Georgia represented by a fiscally conservative Blue Dog Democrat. The district, the Eighth, is in the center of the state, not along the Alabama border. A corrected map can be found at nytimes.com/politics.
Like her colleagues, Representative Stephanie Herseth Sandlin, a South Dakota Democrat and leader of the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition, has been weathering the summer of health care discontent.
There have been the angry constituents, the worried business leaders and even productive talks on what an acceptable health care overhaul should look like. Despite the clamor, Ms. Herseth Sandlin said she still believed that she -- and perhaps a majority of the more than 50 Blue Dogs -- could ultimately get behind a health care package if it was reasonable and represented a consensus Democratic view.
"I want to support necessary change," she said. "But I don't want to support radical change."
Even after the tough town-hall-style meetings, unrelenting Republican assaults and a steady stream of questions from anxious voters, interviews with more than a dozen Blue Dogs and their top aides indicate that many of the lawmakers still believe approval of some form of health care plan is achievable and far preferable to not acting at all.
"I can't tell you how comprehensive it will be, but I do believe something will get passed," said Representative Michael Arcuri, a second-term Blue Dog Democrat from New York.
The political temperature of the Blue Dogs -- and their ideological counterparts in the Senate -- after the five-week recess is crucial. As representatives of some of the nation's most conservative territory represented by Democrats, they potentially have the most to lose if a Democratic bill spurs a backlash. Even with healthy majorities in Congress, every Democratic vote is critical given the reluctance by some Democrats to consider a major overhaul and near blanket Republican opposition.
One lawmaker in the group, Representative David Scott of Georgia, said his determination to enact a health care overhaul had been increased over the recess because of what he called the spread of misinformation and other unfair tactics engaged in by the opposition.
"I think now more than ever we must get strong in our resolve to pass health care insurance reform legislation," Mr. Scott said.
Another coalition member, Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, said that despite the intensity of the health care fight over the last month, he was not sure the Democratic landscape had changed all that much from when House members left Washington in early August.
"The members that were skeptical of the public option going into the recess are still skeptical," Mr. Schiff said. "Those who were supportive are still supportive." He suggested the major transformation was among Republicans, who seem far less open to any health care proposals given the heated sentiments aired by conservative voters.
Administration officials, who have been talking regularly with lawmakers, said they found that most Democrats remained engaged and eager to explore ways to reach agreement.
"For the lion's share of Democratic members of Congress, this isn't about looking for a way to make this disappear," said Rahm Emanuel, the White House chief of staff, about the health care issue. "This is about trying to find common ground for a yes vote."
Senate Democrats have similar internal tensions. Several more conservative Democratic senators have expressed reluctance about elements of proposals favored by liberals, especially the public insurance option, and concern about the overall price tag.
With the recess in its final week and the health care debate nearing a potentially critical moment, Congressional Democrats are also pressing the administration to move more aggressively to unite Democrats. On Sunday on NBC's "Meet the Press," Senator Christopher J. Dodd, the Connecticut Democrat who oversaw the drafting of the Senate health committee's bill, said President Obama must "step up and really frame this again for us."
But even as some moderate and conservative Blue Dogs signaled they were still ready to move forward, it was clear that others could support only a substantially scaled-back approach. That could mean a bill that would fall short of the Democratic goal of extending coverage to the almost 50 million people without health insurance.
"Without wholesale changing the bills, I just don't see how it's going to work," said Representative Jim Marshall of Georgia.
"I didn't intend to vote on it before I left D.C., and I certainly haven't changed my mind about it," said Representative Walt Minnick, a Blue Dog from Idaho.
The sensitivity of the issue was demonstrated by how cautious lawmakers were in even discussing it. Several Blue Dogs declined to talk publicly about their views, while others said health care had become a proxy for general voter distrust of the federal government and fear about the Obama administration's perceived intrusion into private markets.
But the sense from those who did consent to interviews was that once Congress resumes, Democrats need to figure out what they could agree on and how far they should go in remaking the health care system, given the political and fiscal restraints.
With Republicans essentially out of the health care picture for now, Blue Dog members from suburban and rural America said they could provide the ideological balance to the more urban members of the Democratic caucus, who are pushing for a sweeping plan of universal coverage that has drawn public criticism.
Still, the Blue Dogs are split on whether any new health insurance options should be packaged more like a cooperative familiar to voters in the less populated states represented by Blue Dogs or the public insurance idea being pushed by other Democrats.
"I've heard too many stories of Iowans who can't afford health insurance, or can't get coverage for the care they need," said Representative Leonard L. Boswell, a Blue Dog member from that state. "I support a public option so that we can bring down the costs of premiums and curb the inflation of health care costs."
But Ms. Herseth Sandlin, while not ruling out the idea of a public plan, said Democrats needed to think strategically, decide on the limits of a plan that can attract majority support and revisit the issue in the future if they cannot achieve all they want now.
"We have to be pragmatic and forge some deal that moves us in a positive direction," she said. "We have expended unnecessary energy on elements of the plan that I don't think are essential. I remain optimistic that when we come back in September, we will recognize how important it is to get half a loaf."

Stronger Prospects For the President On a Health Care Bill

Abstract: Shaping a Deal Some elements of a deal appear set: an individual mandate requiring Americans to buy coverage; subsidies to help them, financed by taxpayers and employers; steps to overhaul the delivery of health services to reduce costly inefficiencies; new regulations allowing consumers to compare insurance plans, and requiring insurers to accept all customers regardless of pre-existing conditions.

Full text: If sentiment ever ruled the United States Senate, it does not now. Advocates of health care overhaul should not expect a big boost in memory of Senator Edward M. Kennedy.
Yet other factors suggest that President Obama still has stronger prospects for achieving his health policy goals than surface impressions of the Congressional recess indicate. He lags behind his own timetable for action, but remains ahead of presidential predecessors who pursued the same objective.
When the president and Democratic leaders resume work next week, they face big challenges. On substance, the forcefulness of cost controls, the extent of subsidies for the more than 45 million uninsured to buy coverage and mechanisms for changing the insurance marketplace remain under negotiation.
On strategy, Democrats face a parliamentary choice. Even without Mr. Kennedy, they retain a chance to clear the Senate's 60-vote filibuster threshold if just one or two Republicans break from their party.
If they cannot clear the threshold, Democratic strategists believe that their House and Senate majorities can hold under special "reconciliation" rules barring Republican filibusters. In that attempt, Mr. Obama's sagging poll numbers would hold less relevance than memories of Democrats' landslide 1994 defeat after they let President Clinton's health care initiative founder.
"They'll get something done," predicted former Senator John B. Breaux of Louisiana, a Democrat who was relegated to the minority by that Republican Revolution. "It'll be a major step."
A Slide During Recess
The August recess has exacted a toll. The president's job approval rating in a Gallup poll, 55 percent in early August, stands at 50 percent.
Neither the administration nor Senate leaders see much remaining promise in bipartisan Finance Committee negotiations. Given recent gibes from Republican participants, the Sept. 15 deadline for results set by senior Democrats appears a formality.
In the House, raucous constituent gatherings have disquieted conservative Democrats facing the most competitive 2010 re-election contests. House vote-counters estimate that they have expanded the roster of Democratic opponents to approximately 20, from around a dozen when lawmakers left Washington.
The good news for Democrats is that the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, could suffer nearly twice that many defections and still pass health legislation on the House floor. That is how much of a cushion Mr. Obama's party secured by winning 257 seats in 2008.
The party's Senate cushion also remains formidable, though the loss of Mr. Kennedy has for now deprived the majority leader, Harry Reid, of a potential 60th Democratic vote against a filibuster.
But Democratic leaders believe Senator Olympia J. Snowe of Maine, the strongest Republican supporter of comprehensive legislation, might provide that 60th vote. If Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, the strongest Democratic skeptic, defects on a filibuster, Democrats see one more potential ally in Maine's other moderate Republican senator, Susan Collins.
In any case, whether they overcome a filibuster or sidestep it through reconciliation, Democrats would then need to hold just 50 votes to prevail, with Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. available to break a tie.
Shaping a Deal
Some elements of a deal appear set: an individual mandate requiring Americans to buy coverage; subsidies to help them, financed by taxpayers and employers; steps to overhaul the delivery of health services to reduce costly inefficiencies; new regulations allowing consumers to compare insurance plans, and requiring insurers to accept all customers regardless of pre-existing conditions.
Others remain in flux:

Stimulating insurance competition. Some Senate centrists favor nonprofit cooperatives over the "public option" backed by Mr. Obama and House leaders. But Ms. Snowe, who prefers a public option fallback that would be "triggered" by failures in the marketplace, has increasing leverage to dictate that outcome if she chooses.

Financing expanded coverage. While the House aims to tax the highest incomes, a Senate plan to tax the highest-cost insurance plans has gained momentum because economists say it would also curb health inflation. But concerns by Democrats in high-cost states, like Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, may lead lawmakers to narrow the value of plans subject to taxation -- thus reducing revenue for extending coverage as well as the impact on health costs.

The overall price tag. The Finance Committee is pursuing a plan costing roughly $900 billion over 10 years. Dropping that number much further, a potential consequence of deficit worries and the difficulty of enacting tax increases, would make it harder to provide even bare-bones coverage for the vast majority of the uninsured.
Ultimately, however, elements still in dispute appear less likely to derail comprehensive legislation than to alter its precise effects and pace of implementation.
For all the political risks of acting, "Everyone knows the alternative is worse," said Rahm Emanuel, Mr. Obama's chief of staff and a veteran of the Clinton White House. "Failure leads to failure."

Full text: To the Editor:
Re "Real Choice? It's Off Limits in Health Bills" (Economic Scene, front page, Aug. 26):
As a physician, I was encouraged by David Leonhardt's article. He hits the nail on the head. Real consumer choice is not addressed in the bills currently being considered in Congress and by the White House.
In contrast, the Wyden-Bennett bill speaks directly to the issue of choice by phasing out employer-based health insurance and allowing individuals and families to choose the health plan that's best for them. Moreover, the universal coverage this bill proposes is comprehensive, portable, affordable and financially sustainable.
Unfortunately, President Obama seems to feel that universal coverage can be accomplished without changing the status quo. It is time to rethink this position, educate the American public on the real costs of employer-based health care and move in the direction of true health care reform.
Those who stand to benefit most are the American people themselves.

To the Editor:
David Leonhardt correctly argues that private insurance plans and employers exercise too many of the choices in today's health care system, and that a better system would give people more control of their own care. But the other essential half of the dyad that should control the use of medical resources is physicians.
Doctors in consultation with their patients -- not insurance plans, not employers and not government officials -- now make most of the decisions that determine how health dollars are spent. Fee-for-service payment and an entrepreneurial, fragmented system heavily weighted in favor of specialists cause unsustainable cost inflation.
A reform that does not address these problems, as well as eliminate or reduce the role of private insurers and employers, cannot succeed. Regrettably, none of the proposals now before Congress meet this requirement.

To the Editor:
David Leonhardt's article promoting "real choice" in health insurance alludes to a fundamental difficulty with this approach. Without some system for helping the consumer know what he is choosing, the whole premise of the free market breaks down.
As Mr. Leonhardt observes, today's employee depends on his company to provide a menu of sensible choices. As the well-known problems with Medicare Part D insurance demonstrate, having the consumer deal directly with insurance companies is a risky undertaking.
The two major issues, which apply to the broader case as well, are understanding what is covered and being able to change providers if the coverage is modified.
This is not to say that the current system should continue. Mr. Leonhardt's description of its fatal flaws is spot on. But any proposal for "competition" and "free market" mechanisms must include some way to make the consumer an educated consumer.
I expect that one part of this must be government regulation of the details of the insurance that can be offered. Until such mechanisms are added to any free-market scheme, the sensible fears of the currently insured will prevent its adoption.
Marc Auslander
Millwood, N.Y., Aug. 26, 2009

To the Editor:
For most people, "real choice" in health care is not the choice of an insurance plan; it's the choice of a primary care physician.
Employer options come and go, and one private plan is usually as good as another, as long as an involuntary switch doesn't come between a family and a trusted, longtime caregiver. Fragmented physician panels that capriciously interrupt continuity of care are resented by patients and physicians alike.
As in so many other ways, single-payer health care provides the answer: one big panel of doctors, with complete freedom of choice for patients. Of course, that's not politically viable.
It might protect hard-won, deeply valued doctor-patient relationships, and it might save money and produce better health outcomes. But we wouldn't want to harm the insurance industry!

To the Editor:
Historically, Americans have believed in economic competition, freedom of choice and fairness in seeking economic opportunity.
During the rampant industrialization of the nation near the end of the 19th century, competition fell victim to monopolies. The passage of the Sherman Antitrust Act in 1890 was watershed legislation by the federal government to maintain competition.
During the Progressive Era leaders like Woodrow Wilson and Theodore Roosevelt were obliged to call for regulation in business and finance. Franklin D. Roosevelt ushered in even greater federal regulation during the Great Depression.
The current recession has compelled the federal government to become a more gigantic player in the marketplace. President Obama should stick with his call for a public option to bring about choice and competition within the health insurance industry.

To the Editor:
Regardless of their respective strengths and weaknesses, all of the bills for health care reform are too complex to explain, grasp and support. And Republicans have made it abundantly clear that they will oppose any truly meaningful change.
Yet these very obstacles present the president with the opportunity to do what is sensible and right: to put his conviction, passion and clout behind a single-payer system.
Will people be afraid of so radical a change? The majority probably will; people tend to fear the unknown.
But "the shock of the new" is as old as innovation itself. Eventually, people adapt to change and ultimately embrace it.

To the Editor:
Re "World's Best Health Care" (editorial, Aug. 26):
The United States health care system is not the world's best by almost any measure. But one must understand that health care is typically measured by its outcomes. These outcomes, like longevity and infant mortality, are more than just a consequence of availability of health insurance and access to doctors and hospitals.
Health care outcomes are influenced by many complex and poorly understood factors that relate to society's structure, including socioeconomic forces and race. This is true in the United States and globally.
The American health care system is in bad need of reforms that will eliminate the tragedy of 46 million uninsured people.
But our government and its citizens also need to study and address the broader issues, like economic inequity and racial segregation, that underlie our inability to achieve the health care outcomes that other societies have achieved. Otherwise, we will be very disappointed with the results of the current legislative efforts.

Full text: Last week, Congress and the White House released their summer budget updates, touching off a flurry of headlines and commentary suggesting President Obama's agenda would produce deficits exceeding a total of $9 trillion over a decade. Others said $2 trillion. Both calculations were misleading.
While Mr. Obama has proposed nothing to reduce the nation's red ink, he also has not deepened it -- yet.
The analyses of the Congressional Budget Office and the administration's Office of Management and Budget are not exactly comparable for technical reasons. Still, both agree that much of the $9 trillion through fiscal year 2019 is the government's so-called baseline deficit -- the shortfall that would result if current law and policies don't change.
In effect, it is the deficit that Mr. Obama inherited -- about $6.3 trillion by the administration's calculation, $7.1 trillion by the Congressional office's.
Some commentators apparently subtracted the Congressional office's $7.1 trillion baseline deficit from the more than $9 trillion that both agencies say would result under Mr. Obama's policies, and concluded the president would add at least $2 trillion to the decade's debt. But so would any president, Democrat or Republican, since the amount reflects policy adjustments that are costly and almost certain, and that have bipartisan support.
Among the adjustments:
Extending Bush tax cuts past their scheduled 2010 expiration (Mr. Obama, by letting those for the rich lapse, would reduce the revenue loss).
Adjusting the alternative minimum tax for inflation to spare millions of Americans higher income taxes.
Blocking cuts mandated for doctors' Medicare reimbursements.
Those fixes, in turn, would mean hundreds of billions more in interest on the added debt.
As for Mr. Obama's big-ticket proposals, notably health care and energy policy overhauls, those do not add to the deficits under the agencies' analyses because he has proposed savings and tax increases to offset their costs.

Full text: IN the last eight years, home prices in the United States have almost exactly kept up with inflation. But it has been a wild ride.
During the period, the Standard & Poor's Case-Shiller 20-city composite index of home prices rose almost 21 percent. The Consumer Price Index also rose almost 21 percent.
The period, from June 2001 through the June 2009 figures that were reported this week, can be separated into two periods: the five-year boom and the three-year bust. There are limited indications that prices have started to rally in some areas, but the overall index's move in June just kept up with inflation.
During the boom, home prices outpaced inflation by 10.7 percent a year for five years. During the bust, they plunged, trailing inflation by 13.6 percent a year.
The accompanying chart shows the pace of home prices, adjusted for inflation, and also shows the wide sectional variations. At one extreme is Detroit, where the boom never came but the bust has been severe. Adjusted for inflation, prices there are now down by almost half over the eight-year period.
At the other extreme is New York, where the boom was not nearly as strong as in some areas but a larger part of the gains have been retained. At the height of the period, New York prices had outpaced inflation by 62 percent. At the latest report, prices are still up by 20 percent more than inflation.
The Case-Shiller figures cover very large areas for each city. In New York, the region extends from Trenton up to New Haven. The figures reflect sales of single-family homes only, so Manhattan, a market that is dominated by apartments, has a very small impact.
The maximum performance of various areas reflects the differing housing markets.
In areas like Dallas, Denver and Charlotte, N.C., home prices never rose much more than inflation. Those areas had ample land available to spread out, enabling developers to meet demand without major price changes. In contrast, areas like Los Angeles, New York and Washington were largely built up, and developers had to go far from the city to find raw land. In addition, zoning and other rules sometimes limited or delayed building.
That explanation does not, however, help with the two desert booms and busts -- Phoenix and Las Vegas, where speculation went wild despite ample land for expansion. At the height of the boom, new developments around Phoenix would announce plans to begin selling homes -- as yet not even started -- on a Monday and would-be buyers would spend the weekend in sleeping bags outside the development to get a chance to buy.
Many such "buyers" did not expect to ever move into the house, or even pay for it. Instead, they expected to sell their right to the house, at a profit, before construction was completed. When that strategy stopped working, it left a large supply of unoccupied houses to depress prices.
Now foreclosures are still rising, even as home sales and prices seem to have stabilized. If the worst is over, it will have been a wild ride that ended very close to where it began, but with many people much worse off for the experience.

Full text: So new budget projections show a cumulative deficit of $9 trillion over the next decade. According to many commentators, that's a terrifying number, requiring drastic action -- in particular, of course, canceling efforts to boost the economy and calling off health care reform.
The truth is more complicated and less frightening. Right now deficits are actually helping the economy. In fact, deficits here and in other major economies saved the world from a much deeper slump. The longer-term outlook is worrying, but it's not catastrophic.
The only real reason for concern is political. The United States can deal with its debts if politicians of both parties are, in the end, willing to show at least a bit of maturity. Need I say more?
Let's start with the effects of this year's deficit.
There are two main reasons for the surge in red ink. First, the recession has led both to a sharp drop in tax receipts and to increased spending on unemployment insurance and other safety-net programs. Second, there have been large outlays on financial rescues. These are counted as part of the deficit, although the government is acquiring assets in the process and will eventually get at least part of its money back.
What this tells us is that right now it's good to run a deficit. Consider what would have happened if the U.S. government and its counterparts around the world had tried to balance their budgets as they did in the early 1930s. It's a scary thought. If governments had raised taxes or slashed spending in the face of the slump, if they had refused to rescue distressed financial institutions, we could all too easily have seen a full replay of the Great Depression.
As I said, deficits saved the world.
In fact, we would be better off if governments were willing to run even larger deficits over the next year or two. The official White House forecast shows a nation stuck in purgatory for a prolonged period, with high unemployment persisting for years. If that's at all correct -- and I fear that it will be -- we should be doing more, not less, to support the economy.
But what about all that debt we're incurring? That's a bad thing, but it's important to have some perspective. Economists normally assess the sustainability of debt by looking at the ratio of debt to G.D.P. And while $9 trillion is a huge sum, we also have a huge economy, which means that things aren't as scary as you might think.
Here's one way to look at it: We're looking at a rise in the debt/G.D.P. ratio of about 40 percentage points. The real interest on that additional debt (you want to subtract off inflation) will probably be around 1 percent of G.D.P., or 5 percent of federal revenue. That doesn't sound like an overwhelming burden.
Now, this assumes that the U.S. government's credit will remain good so that it's able to borrow at relatively low interest rates. So far, that's still true. Despite the prospect of big deficits, the government is able to borrow money long term at an interest rate of less than 3.5 percent, which is low by historical standards. People making bets with real money don't seem to be worried about U.S. solvency.
The numbers tell you why. According to the White House projections, by 2019, net federal debt will be around 70 percent of G.D.P. That's not good, but it's within a range that has historically proved manageable for advanced countries, even those with relatively weak governments. In the early 1990s, Belgium -- which is deeply divided along linguistic lines -- had a net debt of 118 percent of G.D.P., while Italy -- which is, well, Italy -- had a net debt of 114 percent of G.D.P. Neither faced a financial crisis.
So is there anything to worry about? Yes, but the dangers are political, not economic.
As I've said, those 10-year projections aren't as bad as you may have heard. Over the really long term, however, the U.S. government will have big problems unless it makes some major changes. In particular, it has to rein in the growth of Medicare and Medicaid spending.
That shouldn't be hard in the context of overall health care reform. After all, America spends far more on health care than other advanced countries, without better results, so we should be able to make our system more cost-efficient.
But that won't happen, of course, if even the most modest attempts to improve the system are successfully demagogued -- by conservatives! -- as efforts to "pull the plug on grandma."
So don't fret about this year's deficit; we actually need to run up federal debt right now and need to keep doing it until the economy is on a solid path to recovery. And the extra debt should be manageable. If we face a potential problem, it's not because the economy can't handle the extra debt. Instead, it's the politics, stupid.

Full text: Ten years ago, Washington was worried about the budget outlook, and there were forecasts of dire outcomes. And so it is today.
The difference is the nature of the worries. Alan Greenspan, then the Federal Reserve chairman, talked about the dangers of a shortage of Treasury securities as the $5 trillion surplus forecast for the next decade enabled the national debt to be paid down. This week we were warned of a $9 trillion deficit over the next 10 years.
"The last time people got really excited about a 10-year budget outlook, they were hysterically wrong about what transpired," said Robert Barbera, the chief economist of ITG, who mocked the surplus forecasts then and now thinks the consensus outlook is too negative.
"The $5 trillion surplus was a 'nothing can go wrong' forecast," he said. "No recessions, no wars, no bear markets and a perpetuation of inexplicably high tax receipts. You can make the case that the current conversations about our fiscal outlook are effectively, 'Nothing can go right.' The estimates assume we continue to allocate over $100 billion a year for fighting wars. They assume a very mild recovery for the economy, and an even milder recovery for tax receipts."
It was easier a decade ago to know the forecast was foolish, although few did. The assumption that politicians would refrain from cutting taxes or raising spending in the face of large surpluses had no historical support.
On the other hand, the notion that politicians will point fingers and do nothing as deficits mount has plenty of historical support.
One unusual factor now is that everyone agrees Congress must pass a new tax law. If it does not, taxes on nearly everyone will soar under an absurd plan enacted in 2001 called the snap-back tax, which provides that in 2011 the tax law that had been in effect in 2000 will reappear.
That would drive tax rates up sharply for most people, which might reduce budget deficits. But it is hardly what anyone wants if the economy is not booming by then.
Most of the tax changes being mulled can await Congressional action until next year. Under the snap-back tax plan, however, the estate tax is set to vanish for a year if nothing happens before the end of 2009, just over four months from now.
Heirs of a very rich person who died on Dec. 31, 2010, would get everything, without any estate tax. If that person died a day later, his or her estate would owe 55 percent of everything over $1 million. (I call that the Dr. Kevorkian provision, after the physician who specialized in assisted suicides until he was sent to prison.) How will hospitals respond if heirs demand that life support be ended before the clock strikes 12?
It would have been nice to fix that up in a nonelection year, but the health care debate has consumed Congress. The chairman of one tax-writing committee, Senator Max Baucus, is still trying to shape a bipartisan health care bill, a Sisyphean task that may not leave much time for taxes. The other chairman, Representative Charles Rangel, has just discovered that he forgot to mention a checking account with more than $250,000 in it when he listed his assets. Tax policy may not be on the top of his to-do list either, at least while the dual investigations of his ethics are continuing.
The country got into the current tax mess because George W. Bush wanted it all in 2001. He could overcome procedural hurdles in the Senate and make the 10-year cost of his tax cut appear lower, if the entire bill was labeled temporary. So it was.
To make things worse, that bill did nothing about the alternative minimum tax, which was supposed to catch wealthy citizens with big deductions and force them to pay something. By not lowering the A.M.T. rates when ordinary tax rates were cut, the law negated the cuts for millions of middle-class people. Now Congress passes a temporary fix every year to keep that from happening. President Obama wants to make that fix permanent, something Mr. Bush was hesitant to do because it would have made deficit forecasts look worse.
When Congress does get around to tax law, the political calculations could be fun to watch. Read the numbers one way, and President Obama's proposals call for big increases in taxes on every group. Read them another way, they call for tax cuts for every group except the most prosperous one-tenth of 1 percent of Americans. Guess which interpretation the Republicans, and the Democrats, will choose.
The numbers to back each interpretation come from a new study by the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, estimating effective federal tax rates using both current law and President Obama's legislative proposals. The figures include all federal taxes, allocating corporate taxes to the owners of those companies and payroll taxes to the employees. Middle-income people tend to pay higher payroll taxes than the rich, because there is no Social Security tax on high incomes. The poorest are exempt from income tax, but do pay payroll taxes if they earn money.
In 2009, the average effective rate for all Americans is estimated to be 18.2 percent. The center estimates that if there are no changes in the law, that will rise to 23.4 percent in 2012. If the president's proposals are all adopted, the figure that year will be 20.7 percent, with increases from 2009 for every group -- those with the lowest incomes as well as those with the highest. How can that be, given that the president has promised to raise taxes only on those who make at least $250,000 a year?
Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, points to two reasons. First, Mr. Obama does not want to continue some special tax breaks, like a tax credit for new homeowners, that were part of the stimulus package he pushed through Congress. More important, the 2012 estimates assume a better economy, in which incomes will be higher and more people will therefore be in higher tax brackets.
Mr. Williams argues that, eventually, President Obama's vow not to raise taxes on the middle class is going to have to be violated. "There is just not enough money" earned by the very, very rich, Mr. Williams said.
When, or if, the government does confront the need for more revenue, Mr. Williams says he thinks it might adopt a value-added tax, which amounts to a national sales tax. Others urge energy taxes, to both bring in revenue and discourage energy consumption. Either would be political dynamite if there were not some sort of bipartisan agreement.
Some countries, particularly in eastern Europe, went on enforced austerity this year because no one would lend them money. In the United States, with its dollar printing presses, we assume that could never happen. But it is conceivable that someday investors will grow cautious about lending to a country with so little self-control and demand higher interest rates to protect them from the possibility of a depreciating dollar. Or they might insist on lending in euros or Chinese renminbi, currencies the American government cannot print.
Before the United States gets serious about raising taxes, I suspect that inflation will start to seem much more attractive, even if few are willing to say so publicly. In the past, inflation has enabled the United States to reduce the burden of repaying existing debt, and China, for one, has voiced fears we will do it again. Widespread inflation could also make depreciated assets -- like homes -- worth more dollars than the owner now owes.
Ben Bernanke got a second term as Fed chairman this week, something he earned for his evident success in dealing with the financial crisis. (He failed to see the crisis coming, but few others who might have gotten the job could claim a more prescient record.) In this term, he may find that inflation-fighting is not the road to popularity.
His reappointment should serve as a reminder that things could be much worse. Which would you rather worry about: the specter of Great Depression II, which seemed so real only six months ago, or the possibility of excessive budget deficits in the next decade?

Full text: FOR competence and integrity, few organizations command more respect in Washington than the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. As health care reform makes its way through Congress, the budget office's assessment of how much various elements might cost may determine the details of legislation, and whether it ultimately passes. But when it comes to forecasting the costs of reform, the budget office's record is suspect. In each of the past three decades, when assessing major changes in Medicare, it has substantially underestimated the savings the changes would bring.
In the early 1980s, Congress changed the way Medicare paid hospitals so that payments would no longer be based on costs incurred. Instead, hospitals would receive a predetermined amount per admission, based on the patient's primary medical problem. This encouraged shorter stays, led to fewer diagnostic services and reduced administrative costs. The Congressional Budget Office predicted that, from 1983 to 1986, this change would slow Medicare hospital spending (which had been rising much faster than the rate of inflation) by $10 billion, and that by 1986 total spending would be $60 billion. Actual spending in 1986 was $49 billion. The savings in 1986 alone were as much as three years of estimated savings.
Why was the budget office so far off? It had projected that the new payment strategy would increase hospital admissions, because hospitals would maximize their payments by admitting patients who were less severely ill and discharging them quickly. In short, they would make up money with faster turnover. But in the first year of the new payment system, admissions, which had been increasing, actually declined by 3.5 percent. By the third year, they had declined by 15.9 percent. It may be that the declining admissions resulted from a new and stronger program for reviewing admissions.
But the Congressional Budget Office was correct in assuming that hospital stays would grow shorter. In the first three years of the payment system, the length of Medicare patients' hospital stays, which had been decreasing by 1 percent to 2 percent a year, fell by 17 percent. The new system also led hospitals, for the first time in decades, to cut their work forces -- by 2.3 percent in the first year alone.
In the 1990s, the biggest change in Medicare came with the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, a compromise between a Republican-controlled Congress and a Democratic administration. At the time, the Congressional Budget Office forecast that, from 1998 to 2002, the act would reduce Medicare spending by $112 billion -- a 9.1 percent reduction. Part of that -- $36 billion worth -- would come from paying skilled nursing facilities and home health care services a set fee per patient. But only a tiny fraction of the savings, about $100 million, would come from better monitoring of fraud and abuse on the part of health care providers, according to budget office projections.
The actual savings turned out to be 50 percent greater in 1998 and 113 percent greater in 1999 than the budget office forecast. Overall spending increased just 1.2 percent from 1998 to 2000, rather than 5.6 percent, as was projected. With increased monitoring for fraud and abuse, hospitals billed less aggressively. Spending for skilled nursing facilities, which had increased by 38 percent per year from 1988 to 1997, did not increase at all in 1998 and 1999. At the same time, spending for home health care services, which had been rising at the rate of 25 percent a year, fell by 52 percent. In fact, Medicare spending fell so much that Congress increased payment levels to hospitals and other providers in 1999 and 2000.
In the current decade, the major legislative change to the system was the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003, which added a prescription drug benefit. In assessing how much this new program would cost, the Congressional Budget Office assumed that prices would rise as patients demanded more drugs, and estimated that spending on the drug benefit would be $206 billion.
Actual spending was nearly 40 percent less than that. Spending on drugs declined from fiscal year 2007 to 2008. Seniors proved more willing to buy lower-cost generic drugs than expected, fewer people participated in the program than expected, and competition held premiums down. Few new blockbuster drugs came on the market, so overall drug prices remained relatively constant, rather than accelerating as predicted.
The Congressional Budget Office's consistent forecasting errors arose not from any partisan bias, but from its methods of projection. In analyzing initiatives meant to save money, it helps to be able to refer to similar initiatives in the past that saved money. When there aren't enough good historical examples to go by, the estimated savings based on past experience is essentially considered to be unknown. Too often, "unknown" becomes zero -- even though zero is not a logical estimate.
The budget office has particular difficulty estimating savings when it considers more than one change at once. For example, last December the office reported that it found no consistent evidence that changes in medical malpractice laws would have a measurable effect on health care spending. It also reported that increased spending on studies comparing the effectiveness of different drugs and medical treatments would yield no net savings for 10 years. Yet if both malpractice reform and comparative effectiveness studies were instituted simultaneously, they might work together to yield substantial savings; doctors would gain more confidence in the effectiveness of less aggressive treatments and, at the same time, could use those treatments with less to fear from lawsuits.
The budget office's cautious methods may have unintended consequences in the current health care reform effort. By underestimating the savings that can come from improved Medicare payment procedures and other cost-control initiatives, the budget office leads Congress to think that politically unpopular cost-cutting initiatives will have, at best, only modest effects. This, in turn, forces Congress to believe it can pay for reform only by raising taxes, which then makes reform legislation more difficult to pass.
The Congressional Budget Office's integrity is beyond questioning. But the record shows that it has substantially overestimated the cost of health care reform three times out of three. As Congress now works on its greatest push for reform in generations, the budget office needs to revise the methods it uses to make predictions about costs.

Full text: As he looks forward to a second term as chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben S. Bernanke's biggest challenge will be to undo much of what made him a hero during his first term.
In nominating Mr. Bernanke on Tuesday, Mr. Obama praised the Fed chairman for his "bold action and out-of-the-box thinking," saying it had helped avoid a repeat of the Great Depression.
But most of those bold actions -- lending hundreds of billions of dollars to banks and businesses, slashing overnight interest rates to nearly zero, having the Fed almost single-handedly finance the mortgage market -- will have to be reversed or rolled back over the next few years.
If the Fed shifts too quickly from the role of savior to that of strict disciplinarian, it risks aborting the recovery and tipping the nation back into a recession, essentially repeating mistakes made in 1937 after the economy had begun to rebound. If the Fed moves too slowly, it risks the kind of intractable inflation it experienced in the 1970s and fueling another bubble.
Compounding the problem is the government's fiscal woes, made clear by an announcement on Tuesday that the budget deficit would be greater than previously projected.
For the first time in almost 20 years, the Fed may soon have to make unpopular decisions that raise the cost of borrowing even when the economy still feels weak. It has already decided it must tolerate high unemployment, which the Obama administration said Monday would exceed 10 percent, through at least the end of next year. It is already phasing out smaller programs to provide emergency credit, and will have to decide when to scale back bigger ones.
At some point next year, the Fed may well need to raise interest rates -- possibly rapidly and sharply, given how far it cut them last year -- and in the process raise the cost of things like credit cards, mortgages and business loans.
Any or all of those actions will probably restrain economic growth and keep unemployment rates high, potentially putting the Bernanke Fed on a collision course with the Obama White House.
The federal government's enormous fiscal problem makes that clash more likely. The White House estimated on Tuesday that the government faced a $9 trillion budget shortfall over the next 10 years. The annual deficits will exceed $1 trillion through 2011, the administration said, and the annual cost of paying interest on the debt will exceed $600 billion in 2019.
The government's enormous borrowing needs will probably put pressure on the private sector after the economy begins to expand. If that happens, investors may demand higher interest rates on Treasury securities and ultimately drive up borrowing costs for government and businesses alike.
The Fed has faced that kind of conflict before, and the politics were not pretty. Paul A. Volcker, the Fed chairman who tamed inflation in the early 1980s after pushing the federal funds rate to 20 percent, came under attack from businesses, farmers and the White House under President Ronald Reagan.
Alan Greenspan faced considerable pressure in the early 1990s, when President George H. W. Bush wanted him to cut interest rates more quickly. To this day, many alumni of the Bush administration blame Mr. Greenspan for Mr. Bush's re-election defeat.
What worries some experts, including Mr. Bernanke, is that the Fed's expanding role during the financial crisis exposes it to political pressure. Lawmakers, having seen the Fed bail out corporations and extend credit to entire industries, have prodded the central bank to help out other constituencies, like recreational vehicle manufacturers.
At the same time, the Fed's political critics are multiplying. A bill sponsored by Representative Ron Paul, Republican of Texas, would empower the Government Accountability Office to "audit" the Fed's decisions on interest rates. Mr. Bernanke and other Fed officials have warned that that would damage the Fed's independence. Still, the measure has been signed by more than 250 lawmakers in both parties.
Mr. Obama, announcing his decision to nominate Mr. Bernanke for another term, vowed to "continue to maintain a strong and independent Federal Reserve."
And in supporting Mr. Bernanke, a Republican first appointed by President George W. Bush, Mr. Obama signaled that he was willing to rise above party loyalties.
"Ben approached a financial system on the verge of collapse with calm and wisdom," Mr. Obama said.
Unless a disaster erupts out of nowhere, Mr. Bernanke's Senate confirmation appears certain.
"While I have had serious differences with the Federal Reserve over the past few years, I think reappointing Chairman Bernanke is probably the right choice," said Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut and chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, in a statement on Tuesday.
Mr. Dodd, who has frequently accused the Fed of failing to rein in reckless mortgage lending, added that Mr. Bernanke had "ultimately demonstrated effective leadership" in the crisis.
At the Fed's annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyo., last weekend, some analysts criticized Mr. Bernanke for sending contradictory signals.
"The Fed is simultaneously promising to keep interest rates low for an extended period, while also promising to keep inflation from rising," said Carl E. Walsh, a professor of economics at the University of California, Santa Cruz, in a paper delivered at the conference.
Fed officials disagreed with his assessment, countering that inflation was, if anything, at risk of being lower than they would like.
"The low interest rates are designed to keep inflation from falling, and falling persistently below where we want them to be," said Donald L. Kohn, vice chairman of the Federal Reserve.
For the moment, Mr. Bernanke has some breathing room. Even though the federal government is borrowing at a staggering pace, American businesses and consumers have slowed their own borrowing so much that the United States total is down from previous years.
Foreign investors seeking a haven have plowed vast amounts of money into Treasury securities. As a result, interest rates on long-term Treasury bonds, which directly influence interest rates on corporate loans and home mortgages, remain low.
But as business activity picks up around the world, the competition among debt issuers is likely to increase and interest rates could rise. Clashing priorities are not hard to imagine. The Obama White House might want to lift a sluggish recovery by keeping interest rates low. And the Bernanke Fed may want to head off inflation -- before it is too late.

Abstract: Over all, the Agriculture Department forecast that prices for what it calls "food at home," a category that includes purchases at grocery stores, convenience stores and farmers' markets, will rise 2 to 3 percent this year.

Full text: Prices for beef, milk, eggs and some other grocery items have been dropping for several months, providing relief for consumers who suffered through the steep increases of a year ago. But prices are likely to start edging upward again as the economy recovers, according to a new federal report and economic analysts.
"The impact from lower energy prices on grocery store prices has largely been played out, and so we're now looking at grocery store prices to rise modestly through the end of the year," said Mark Vitner, a managing director and senior economist at Wells Fargo.
The government report, by the Economic Research Service of the Department of Agriculture, said that grocery prices decreased 0.5 percent in July, compared with June. Compared with July 2008, when overall food costs were surging, grocery prices in July were down 0.9 percent.
In several food categories, prices dropped sharply. Beef fell 2.3 percent in July, compared with June, the eighth decrease in the last nine months, according to the report. Egg prices were down 2.7 percent from June to July and were 21.3 percent below their level in July a year ago. Milk prices declined 0.4 percent in the month, the 10th decline in the last 11 months, and were 18.4 percent below July 2008.
The national average price for a gallon of fresh whole milk in July was $2.99, compared with $3.96 in the same month a year earlier, a 25 percent drop, according to federal data.
Prices for fresh fruit and vegetables were also down markedly compared with their levels a year ago.
In contrast, some food prices rose compared with last year, including breakfast cereals, sugar and carbonated drinks.
Over all, the Agriculture Department forecast that prices for what it calls "food at home," a category that includes purchases at grocery stores, convenience stores and farmers' markets, will rise 2 to 3 percent this year. Last year, the department said, prices for food at home rose 6.4 percent, the highest jump in nearly two decades.
"We do expect some price increases with the recovering economy," said Ephraim Leibtag, a senior economist at the Agriculture Department. "Our numbers here imply there has to be some additional inflation in the next six months to get out of the negatives we're in right now."
Bill Lapp, president of Advanced Economic Solutions, a consulting firm that specializes in analysis of food commodity costs, said that even with only a modest gain this year, food inflation was expected to outpace the overall rise in the Consumer Price Index, which he said could be close to zero for the year.
Mr. Lapp said that one reason food prices would continue to rise was that commodities like corn continued to trade above historical averages, even though they had come down from the unusually high levels they reached last year.
And some of the food categories that have recorded price declines, like beef, pork, poultry and dairy products, will begin to go back up as farmers cull herds and flocks, causing supplies of those products to decline.
"I think that the food inflation wake-up call won't begin, in large measure, until late this year and in 2010," Mr. Lapp said. He said, however, that there were already signs of rising prices for chicken and milk.
Faith Weiner, senior director of public affairs for Stop & Shop, the supermarket chain, said that shoppers had been snapping up large packages of meat or poultry when they were on sale.
"We think folks are stocking up," Ms. Weiner said. "You might have a special on chicken breasts, a Big Buy packet at a reduced price. People are buying more than they normally would and freezing them because it's a good value."

Full text: An Opportunity
To Regain Luster
Ben Bernanke is not exactly getting a reward for failure. Mr. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, is being renominated for a second term as the world's most powerful central banker.
He made one big mistake in his first term, but a bigger success is still possible. If that's not forthcoming, there will be nothing rewarding about staying in office.
Mr. Bernanke's greatest failure was intellectual. He did not comprehend the economic risks of modern financial practices. He supported the enthusiasm for financial deregulation and innovation shown by Alan Greenspan, his predecessor. In 2004, he hailed the "macroeconomic flexibility and stability" provided by "the increased depth and sophistication of financial markets" and increased openness to international capital flows.
The theoretical underestimation probably encouraged Mr. Bernanke to excessive optimism as the financial crisis developed. In May 2007, when the subprime mortgage market was crumbling, the Fed believed the effect on the broader housing market would be "limited" with no "significant spillovers" to the economy or even the financial system.
In October of that year, with money markets tightening, Mr. Bernanke could not have been clearer: "The banking system is healthy."
He was spectacularly wrong. Under his watch, the so-called Great Moderation -- the years of steady growth and low inflation around the world -- developed into the worst financial crisis and recession in six decades. Mr. Bernanke's Fed did, at least, respond aggressively with an array of unprecedented policies.
President Obama was presumably not thinking about Mr. Bernanke's discredited confidence when he decided to name him to a second four-year term. Mr. Obama knows that jittery investors want continuity. Even if the president desired change, he would have struggled to find a distinguished economist with a greatly different agenda.
Mr. Bernanke the activist could yet prove much more successful than Mr. Bernanke the optimist. Gross domestic product is still depressed, the financial system is still on government life support and the Fed's policy interest rate and balance sheet are still at abnormal levels.
A better judgment should be possible by the time Mr. Bernanke's new term expires in 2014. So he should be around to take the glory, or feel the shame.
G.M. Walks Fine Line
It's the best idea that's come up so far about Opel. Keep it in the house.
Opel, the troubled European division of General Motors, was put on the block this year when its parent company's own future was in doubt. Since then, the skies have cleared somewhat, after the United States government took over G.M. and the company emerged quickly from bankruptcy.
After three months of protracted negotiations, G.M. doesn't seem happy with any of the potential buyers' terms. One reason is that it wants to keep strong industrial and technological ties to Opel. So why not go back to the drawing board and keep the division?
The problem with this option is that it omits the 800-pound gorilla monitoring the proceedings: Germany, home to about half of Opel's work force. Chancellor Angela Merkel's government has pledged support to Opel with some 3 billion euros ($4.3 billion) of financial guarantees.
It also extended the company a bridge loan of 1.5 billion euros in May when G.M. entered into talks with the Canadian car-parts maker Magna International. But G.M. and Magna still haven't come to an agreement, and Germany is frowning on other suitors.
The Magna bid is largely financed by Sberbank, Russia's largest lender, which has ties to the ailing Russian car manufacturer Gaz. G.M.'s board is balking both at technology transfers to Russia and possible future competition from Opel on the Russian market. Germany, on the other hand, is favoring the Magna bid because it would save more jobs.
Whatever the outcome of the talks, it's hard to see how G.M., based in Detroit, could afford to antagonize Germany's government and unions while keeping its hat in hand for public money. The carmaker has already ruffled German feathers by not settling the Opel crisis sooner. Germany's general elections will be held on Sept. 27, and Mrs. Merkel wants to be able to show voters some kind of long-term solution to Opel's woes.
It may be that by dangling yet another solution to the problem, G.M. simply wants to extract better terms from Magna. But the company may also be playing with fire.

Full text: AS the United States rolls up record budget deficits, Asian countries are showing a reduced willingness to finance the debt.
Figures released by the Treasury Department this week indicated that China reduced its holdings of Treasury securities by $25 billion in June, the most China had ever sold in a month.
Monthly figures can be volatile, and can be revised, so it is risky to draw conclusions from one month's data. In May, China increased its holdings by $38 billion, according to the Treasury figures.
Nonetheless, the decline highlighted a fact shown in the accompanying graphics: Asia's appetite for Treasury securities is not growing as fast as it once did. That means the United States will have to turn to other buyers, including American citizens, who are now saving as they did not do during the boom years, to finance the deficits.
China and Hong Kong, which is reported separately but is combined under China in the accompanying graphic, together covered more than half of the increase in the amount of Treasuries sold to the public -- that is, to buyers other than United States government agencies like the Federal Reserve or Social Security -- in 2006.
That share had fallen to 22 percent last year, when the government increased its public debt by a record $1.2 trillion. In the first half of 2009, China and Hong Kong acquired only 9 percent of the more than $800 billion worth of Treasuries that were sold.
Japan, which was replaced by China as the largest foreign holder of Treasuries last year, has been a larger buyer this year, taking up 11 percent of the new supply of Treasuries.
The figures include both government and private ownership of Treasuries, and private transactions affect the figures in both Hong Kong and Japan. But in China, the overwhelming ownership is by the government, which has accumulated the securities in part to hold down the value of its currency against the dollar, thus making Chinese exports to the United States more attractive.
In recent months, some Chinese officials have indicated concern of inflation in the United States that could erode the real value of their holdings, and have talked of diversifying their investments. The slowed purchases could reflect those concerns, or could simply be a result of China's own aggressive stimulus program, which has involved large public spending.
The charts reflect ownership of Treasuries by China and Hong Kong, Japan and four other countries -- South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand -- since 1994. On a dollar basis, the holdings are increasing, but their share of outstanding Treasuries has stopped growing.
Over the decade from 1994 to 2004, their combined share of Treasuries rose to 25 percent, from less than 8 percent. Since then, as budget deficits in the United States grew, the share has fluctuated within a narrow range. In June, it was 24.7 percent.

Abstract: A growing number of economists and some Fed officials say the shift to tighter monetary policies and higher interest rates, though unlikely to start until at least the middle of next year, may have to be much more abrupt than normal if they are to prevent inflation two or three years from now.

Full text: CORRECTION: An article on Aug. 22 about growing confidence among central bankers that a global economic recovery was taking shape misstated the name of the area where the bankers were gathered at the Federal Reserve's annual retreat. It is Grand Teton National Park, not ''the Grand Tetons.'' (The Teton range gets its name from a single mountain known as Grand Teton.)
Central bankers from around the world expressed growing confidence on Friday that the worst of the financial crisis was over and that a global economic recovery was beginning to take shape.
"The prospects for a return to growth in the near term appear good," declared Ben S. Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, offering optimism both about the United States and the worldwide outlook.
Though the Fed chairman repeated his warning that the economic recovery here was likely to be slow and arduous and that unemployment would remain high for another year, he went beyond the central bank's most recent statement that economic activity was "leveling out." Speaking to central bankers and economists at the Fed's annual retreat here in the Grand Tetons, Mr. Bernanke echoed the growing relief among European and Asian central bankers that their own economies had already started to rebound.
Even as they indulged in a bit of self-congratulation over what had been achieved since the financial crisis of last year, these central bankers were beginning to focus quietly on another big task, how they will unwind the vast emergency measures they put in place to fight the crisis.
At almost the same time that Mr. Bernanke spoke, the National Association of Realtors reported that sales of existing homes jumped 7.2 percent in July -- the biggest monthly increase in more than a decade and much bigger than analysts had expected.
Investors reacted ebulliently to both the housing news and to the Fed chairman's remarks. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped as soon as the markets opened and ended the day up 155.91 points, or 1.67 percent, at 9505.96. Though stock prices are far below their record highs, the Dow has risen 45 percent from March and is at its highest point this year.
Shares of major home builders surged on the improvement in home sales, which was the fourth monthly increase in a row. While forecasters had expected a gain, the size of it jolted investors.
But stocks for a wide range of other companies climbed higher as well, as did the prices of oil, copper and gold. Shares climbed for industrial companies, energy producers and manufacturers of chemicals, plastics and other basic materials.
"This is a bull market," said Laszlo Birinyi Jr., president of Birinyi Associates, who said he was investing in large banks, well-established technology companies like Apple and big industrial companies like 3M and United States Steel. "There's just a desire to be in the market and hope that the train will again leave the station."
Here in Jackson Hole, the mood of relief and cautious confidence among central bankers and economists on Friday was almost palpable -- a stark contrast to the anxiety and tension that permeated their retreat here one year ago.
"It is reasonable to declare that the worst of the crisis is behind us, and that the first signs of global growth have appeared earlier than we generally expected nine months ago," said Stanley Fischer, governor of the Bank of Israel and a top former official at the International Monetary Fund.
In the past week, France and Germany both surprised forecasters by reporting positive growth after a string of quarterly contractions. Japan followed with its own growth report.
The Fed and other central banks will have to unwind a number of emergency measures deployed during the peak of the crisis as growth returns.
A growing number of economists and some Fed officials say the shift to tighter monetary policies and higher interest rates, though unlikely to start until at least the middle of next year, may have to be much more abrupt than normal if they are to prevent inflation two or three years from now.
"When you get into a crisis like this, gradualism is not the right strategy," said Frederic S. Mishkin, an economist at Columbia University who was a Fed governor from 2006 until 2008. "Of course, when things turn around, you have to be aggressive in the other direction."
Indeed, the Federal Reserve's "exit strategy" could lead to a clash with the Obama administration. The White House plans to release its newest budget estimates next week, and administration officials said that the 10-year deficit will rise to $9 trillion -- a big jump from its earlier estimate of $7 trillion.
Some Fed officials are already worried about criticism that they are financing the government's deficits by buying up long-term Treasury securities, and the central bank announced last week that it would end that program next month.
In the future, Fed officials could feel more pressure to further tighten monetary policy as a way of countering the government's deficit spending. The immense amount of borrowing could push up long-term interest rates, if foreign investors balk at buying up United States debt.
Assessing the extraordinary events of the last year, Mr. Bernanke argued that aggressive action by countries around the world prevented a collapse that would have been even worse than what actually took place.
Asserting that short-term lending markets are functioning more normally, that corporate bond issuance is strong and that other "previously moribund" securitization markets are reviving, Mr. Bernanke said that both the United States and other major countries were poised for growth.
In emphasizing not just an imminent end to the recession but also good chances for actual growth, Mr. Bernanke's assessment was in some ways surprising.
Despite encouraging signs on many fronts, American retailers have reported unexpectedly weak sales in the last week -- a sign that that consumer spending could drag down economic growth in the months ahead. And on Thursday, the Labor Department reported that new unemployment claims jumped again.
And on Friday, a prominent banking analyst warned that hundreds more American banks would fail over the next year, adding to the difficulties that small businesses have experienced in routine borrowing.
"There will be over 300 bank closures," Meredith Whitney, the Wall Street analyst who accurately predicted last year that Citigroup would have to cut its dividend, said in an interview with Bloomberg Television in Jackson Hole.
Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the European Central Bank, cautioned against assuming that the world was back to normal.
"We still have a lot of work to do," he said, adding that "it would be a catastrophe" if governments failed to heed the lessons of the crisis and financial regulation.
Mr. Bernanke acknowledged that the banking system's problems were far from over.
"Strains persist in many financial markets across the globe," he cautioned. "Financial institutions face significant additional losses, and many businesses and households continue to experience considerable difficulty gaining access to credit."

Full text: CORRECTION: Because of an editing error, an article on Friday about evidence of the reversal of a 30-year trend of wealthy people becoming wealthier misstated the acreage of the Hawaiian estate recently sold by John McAfee, a software designer whose net worth has plummeted. It is 5.34 acres, not 534.
The rich have been getting richer for so long that the trend has come to seem almost permanent.
They began to pull away from everyone else in the 1970s. By 2006, income was more concentrated at the top than it had been since the late 1920s. The recent news about resurgent Wall Street pay has seemed to suggest that not even the Great Recession could reverse the rise in income inequality.
But economists say -- and data is beginning to show -- that a significant change may in fact be under way. The rich, as a group, are no longer getting richer. Over the last two years, they have become poorer. And many may not return to their old levels of wealth and income anytime soon.
For every investment banker whose pay has recovered to its prerecession levels, there are several who have lost their jobs -- as well as many wealthy investors who have lost millions. As a result, economists and other analysts say, a 30-year period in which the super-rich became both wealthier and more numerous may now be ending.
The relative struggles of the rich may elicit little sympathy from less well-off families who are dealing with the effects of the worst recession in a generation. But the change does raise several broader economic questions. Among them is whether harder times for the rich will ultimately benefit the middle class and the poor, given that the huge recent increase in top incomes coincided with slow income growth for almost every other group. In blunter terms, the question is whether the better metaphor for the economy is a rising tide that can lift all boats -- or a zero-sum game.
Just how much poorer the rich will become remains unclear. It will be determined by, among other things, whether the stock market continues its recent rally and what new laws Congress passes in the wake of the financial crisis. At the very least, though, the rich seem unlikely to return to the trajectory they were on.
Last year, the number of Americans with a net worth of at least $30 million dropped 24 percent, according to CapGemini and Merrill Lynch Wealth Management. Monthly income from stock dividends, which is concentrated among the affluent, has fallen more than 20 percent since last summer, the biggest such decline since the government began keeping records in 1959.
Bill Gates, Warren E. Buffett, the heirs to the Wal-Mart Stores fortune and the founders of Google each lost billions last year, according to Forbes magazine. In one stark example, John McAfee, an entrepreneur who founded the antivirus software company that bears his name, is now worth about $4 million, from a peak of more than $100 million. Mr. McAfee will soon auction off his last big property because he needs cash to pay his bills after having been caught off guard by the simultaneous crash in real estate and stocks.
"I had no clue," he said, "that there would be this tandem collapse."
Some of the clearest signs of the reversal of fortunes can be found in data on spending by the wealthy. An index that tracks the price of art, the Mei Moses index, has dropped 32 percent in the last six months. The New York Yankees failed to sell many of the most expensive tickets in their new stadium and had to drop the price. In one ZIP code in Vail, Colo., only five homes sold for more than $2 million in the first half of this year, down from 34 in the first half of 2007, according to MDA Dataquick. In Bronxville, an affluent New York suburb, the decline was to two, from 17, according to Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage.
"We had a period of roughly 50 years, from 1929 to 1979, when the income distribution tended to flatten," said Neal Soss, the chief economist at Credit Suisse. "Since the early '80s, incomes have tended to get less equal. And I think we've entered a phase now where society will move to a more equal distribution."
No More '50s and '60s
Few economists expect the country to return to the relatively flat income distribution of the 1950s and 1960s. Indeed, they say that inequality is likely to remain significantly greater than it was for most of the 20th century. The Obama administration has not proposed completely rewriting the rules for Wall Street or raising the top income-tax rate to anywhere near 70 percent, its level as recently as 1980. Market forces that have increased inequality, like globalization, are also not going away.
But economists say that the rich will probably not recover their losses immediately, as they did in the wake of the dot-com crash earlier this decade. That quick recovery came courtesy of a new bubble in stocks, which in 2007 were more expensive by some measures than they had been at any other point save the bull markets of the 1920s or 1990s. This time, analysts say, Wall Street seems unlikely to return soon to the extreme levels of borrowing that made such a bubble possible.
Any major shift in the financial status of the rich could have big implications. A drop in their income and wealth would complicate life for elite universities, museums and other institutions that received lavish donations in recent decades. Governments -- federal and state -- could struggle, too, because they rely heavily on the taxes paid by the affluent.
Perhaps the broadest question is what a hit to the wealthy would mean for the middle class and the poor. The best-known data on the rich comes from an analysis of Internal Revenue Service returns by Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez, two economists. Their work shows that in the late 1970s, the cutoff to qualify for the highest-earning one ten-thousandth of households was roughly $2 million, in inflation-adjusted, pretax terms. By 2007, it had jumped to $11.5 million.
The gains for the merely affluent were also big, if not quite huge. The cutoff to be in the top 1 percent doubled since the late 1970s, to roughly $400,000.
By contrast, pay at the median -- which was about $50,000 in 2007 -- rose less than 20 percent, Census data shows. Near the bottom of the income distribution, the increase was about 12 percent.
Some economists say they believe that the contrasting trends are unrelated. If anything, these economists say, any problems the wealthy have will trickle down, in the form of less charitable giving and less consumer spending. Over the last century, the worst years for the rich were the early 1930s, the heart of the Great Depression.
Other economists say the recent explosion of incomes at the top did hurt everyone else, by concentrating economic and political power among a relatively small group.
"I think incredibly high incomes can have a pernicious effect on the polity and the economy," said Lawrence Katz, a Harvard economist. Much of the growth of high-end incomes stemmed from market forces, like technological innovation, Mr. Katz said. But a significant amount also stemmed from the wealthy's newfound ability to win favorable government contracts, low tax rates and weak financial regulation, he added.

The I.R.S. has not yet released its data for 2008 or 2009. But Mr. Saez, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, said he believed that the rich had become poorer. Asked to speculate where the cutoff for the top one ten-thousandth of households was now, he said from $6 million to $8 million.
For the number to return to $11 million quickly, he said, would probably require a large financial bubble.
Making More Money
The United States economy experienced two such bubbles in recent years -- one in stocks, the other in real estate -- and both helped the rich become richer. Mr. McAfee, whose tattoos and tinted hair suggest an independent streak, is an extreme but telling example. For two decades, at almost every step of his career, he figured out a way to make more money.
In the late 1980s, he founded McAfee Associates, the antivirus software company. It gave away its software, unlike its rivals, but charged fees to those who wanted any kind of technical support. That decision helped make it a huge success. The company went public in 1992, in the early years of one of biggest stock market booms in history.
But Mr. McAfee is, by his own description, an atypical businessman -- easily bored and given to serial obsessions. As a young man, he traveled through Mexico, India and Nepal and, more recently, he wrote a book called, "Into the Heart of Truth: The Spirit of Relational Yoga." Two years after McAfee Associates went public, he was bored again.
So he sold his remaining stake, bringing his gains to about $100 million. In the coming years, he started new projects and made more investments. Almost inevitably, they paid off.
"History told me that you just keep working, and it is easy to make more money," he said, sitting in the kitchen of his adobe-style house in the southwest corner of New Mexico. With low tax rates, he added, the rich could keep much of what they made.
One of the starkest patterns in the data on inequality is the extent to which the incomes of the very rich are tied to the stock market. They have risen most rapidly during the biggest bull markets: in the 1920s and the 20 years starting in 1987.
"We are coming from an abnormal period where a tremendous amount of wealth was created largely by selling assets back and forth," said Mohamed A. El-Erian, chief executive of Pimco, one of the country's largest bond traders, and the former manager of Harvard's endowment.
Some of this wealth was based on real economic gains, like those from the computer revolution. But much of it was not, Mr. El-Erian said. "You had wealth creation that could not be tied to the underlying economy," he added, "and the benefits were very skewed: they went to the assets of the rich. It was financial engineering."
But if the rich have done well in bubbles, they have taken enormous hits to their wealth during busts. A recent study by two Northwestern University economists found that the incomes of the affluent tend to fall more, in percentage terms, in recessions than the incomes of the middle class. The incomes of the very affluent -- the top one ten-thousandth -- fall the most.
Over the last several years, Mr. McAfee began to put a large chunk of his fortune into real estate, often in remote locations. He bought the house in New Mexico as a playground for himself and fellow aerotrekkers, people who fly unlicensed, open-cockpit planes. On a 157-acre spread, he built a general store, a 35-seat movie theater and a cafe, and he bought vintage cars for his visitors to use.
He continued to invest in financial markets, sometimes borrowing money to increase the potential returns. He typically chose his investments based on suggestions from his financial advisers. One of their recommendations was to put millions of dollars into bonds tied to Lehman Brothers.
For a while, Mr. McAfee's good run, like that of many of the American wealthy, seemed to continue. In the wake of the dot-com crash, stocks started rising again, while house prices just continued to rise. Outside's Go magazine and National Geographic Adventure ran articles on his New Mexico property, leading to him to believe that "this was the hottest property on the planet," he said.
But then things began to change.
In 2007, Mr. McAfee sold a 10,000-square-foot home in Colorado with a view of Pike's Peak. He had spent $25 million to buy the property and build the house. He received $5.7 million for it. When Lehman collapsed last fall, its bonds became virtually worthless. Mr. McAfee's stock investments cost him millions more.
One day, he realized, as he said, "Whoa, my cash is gone."
His remaining net worth of about $4 million makes him vastly wealthier than most Americans, of course. But he has nonetheless found himself needing cash and desperately trying to reduce his monthly expenses.
He has sold a 10-passenger Cessna jet and now flies coach. This week his oceanfront estate in Hawaii sold for $1.5 million, with only a handful of bidders at the auction. He plans to spend much of his time in Belize, in part because of more favorable taxes there.
Next week, his New Mexico property will be the subject of a no-floor auction, meaning that Mr. McAfee has promised to accept the top bid, no matter how low it is.
"I am trying to face up to the reality here that the auction may bring next to nothing," he said.
In the past, when his stock investments did poorly, he sold real estate and replenished his cash. This time, that has not been an option.
Stock Market Mystery
The possibility that the stock market will quickly recover from its collapse, as it did earlier this decade, is perhaps the biggest uncertainty about the financial condition of the wealthy. Since March, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has risen 49 percent.
Yet Wall Street still has a long way to go before reaching its previous peaks. The S.& P. 500 remains 35 percent below its 2007 high. Aggregate compensation for the financial sector fell 14 percent from 2007 to 2008, according to the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association -- far less than profits or revenue fell, but a decline nonetheless.
"The difference this time," predicted Byron R. Wein, a former chief investment strategist at Morgan Stanley, who started working on Wall Street in 1965, "is that the high-water mark that people reached in 2007 is not going to be exceeded for a very long time."
Without a financial bubble, there will simply be less money available for Wall Street to pay itself or for corporate chief executives to pay themselves. Some companies -- like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase, which face less competition now and have been helped by the government's attempts to prop up credit markets -- will still hand out enormous paychecks. Over all, though, there will be fewer such checks, analysts say. Roger Freeman, an analyst at Barclays Capital, said he thought that overall Wall Street compensation would, at most, increase moderately over the next couple of years.
Beyond the stock market, government policy may have the biggest effect on top incomes. Mr. Katz, the Harvard economist, argues that without policy changes, top incomes may indeed approach their old highs in the coming years. Historically, government policy, like the New Deal, has had more lasting effects on the rich than financial busts, he said.
One looming policy issue today is what steps Congress and the administration will take to re-regulate financial markets. A second issue is taxes.
In the three decades after World War II, when the incomes of the rich grew more slowly than those of the middle class, the top marginal rate ranged from 70 to 91 percent. Mr. Piketty, one of the economists who analyzed the I.R.S. data, argues that these high rates did not affect merely post-tax income. They also helped hold down the pretax incomes of the wealthy, he says, by giving them less incentive to make many millions of dollars.
Since 1980, tax rates on the affluent have fallen more than rates on any other group; this year, the top marginal rate is 35 percent. President Obama has proposed raising it to 39 percent and has said he would consider a surtax on families making more than $1 million a year, which could push the top rate above 40 percent.
What any policy changes will mean for the nonwealthy remains unclear. There have certainly been periods when the rich, the middle class and the poor all have done well (like the late 1990s), as well as periods when all have done poorly (like the last year). For much of the 1950s, '60s and '70s, both the middle class and the wealthy received raises that outpaced inflation.
Yet there is also a reason to think that the incomes of the wealthy could potentially have a bigger impact on others than in the past: as a share of the economy, they are vastly larger than they once were.
In 2007, the top one ten-thousandth of households took home 6 percent of the nation's income, up from 0.9 percent in 1977. It was the highest such level since at least 1913, the first year for which the I.R.S. has data.
The top 1 percent of earners took home 23.5 percent of income, up from 9 percent three decades earlier.

Abstract: The spring and summer box office has murdered megawatt stars like Denzel Washington, Julia Roberts, Eddie Murphy, John Travolta, Russell Crowe, Tom Hanks, Adam Sandler and Will Ferrell. Studios, struggling to cut costs after a 25 percent drop in DVD sales, aren't giving up on top-tier stars -- their presence can make a huge difference overseas and factor heavily into the sale of movies to television channels -- but they are trying to pay them less or looking for less-expensive alternatives.

Full text: CORRECTION: A chart with the continuation of an article on Friday about the weak box-office performance of some summer movies featuring major stars like Denzel Washington and Tom Hanks misidentified, in some copies, the film in which Arnold Schwarzenegger was shown in a scene. It was his 1985 film ''Commando,'' not his 1990 film ''Total Recall.''
The spring and summer box office has murdered megawatt stars like Denzel Washington, Julia Roberts, Eddie Murphy, John Travolta, Russell Crowe, Tom Hanks, Adam Sandler and Will Ferrell.
Can Brad Pitt escape?
A-list movie stars have long been measured by their ability to fill theaters on opening weekend. But never have so many failed to deliver, resulting in some rare soul-searching by motion picture studios about why the old formula isn't working -- and a great deal of anxiety among stars (and agents) about the potential vaporization of their $20 million paychecks.
"The cratering of films with big stars is astounding," said Peter Guber, the former chairman of Sony Pictures who is now a producer and industry elder statesman. "These supertalented people are failing to aggregate a large audience, and everybody is looking for answers."
Mr. Guber added, "Even Johnny Depp" -- starring in the drama "Public Enemies" -- "didn't exactly deliver a phenomenal result." (The A-list results may be damped partly because Will Smith, a regular summer powerhouse, had no movie open this season.)
Mr. Ferrell bombed in "Land of the Lost," a $100 million comedy that sold only $49 million in tickets in North America. Ms. Roberts missed with "Duplicity," a $60 million thriller that attracted $40.6 million. "Angels & Demons" (Mr. Hanks) was soft. The same for "The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3" (Mr. Washington and Mr. Travolta).
"Imagine That," starring Mr. Murphy, was such a disaster that Paramount Pictures had to take a write-down. Mr. Sandler? His "Funny People"limped out of the gate and then collapsed. Some of these may simply have not been very good, but an A-list star is supposed to overcome that.
The gradual trend away from big-star vehicles in the summer has been under way for years.
At the start of the decade, summer still belonged to names: Cruise ("Mission Impossible II"), Crowe ("Gladiator") and Clooney ("The Perfect Storm") were the top three in 2000. But the three biggest films of this summer season, a crucial period from May 1 to Labor Day that typically accounts for 40 percent of annual ticket sales, have been "Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," "Up" and "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince."
The biggest names attached to those films: Shia LaBoeuf, Ed Asner and Daniel Radcliffe.
The fading ability of Hollywood stars to command box-office attention, and why that is happening, has been a perennial topic in Hollywood. And economists and academics have long argued that marquee names are not worth their expense.
"Stars and success as a corollary is largely a myth," said S. Abraham Ravid, an economics professor at Rutgers University who has conducted several studies on movie business practices.
But some of the same well-worn reasoning for declining star power has become even truer with time: people are harder to move off the sofa; a plethora of entertainment options competes for time and attention; the Web and paparazzi culture have made it difficult for stars to stand apart as rare and unique.
"Stars will always be important, but the industry is definitely seeing a transformation in their ability to open movies," Marc Shmuger, the chairman of Universal Pictures, said in an interview last month.
How is Hollywood reacting to the power brownout? Studios, struggling to cut costs after a 25 percent drop in DVD sales, aren't giving up on top-tier stars -- their presence can make a huge difference overseas and factor heavily into the sale of movies to television channels -- but they are trying to pay them less or looking for less-expensive alternatives.
These battles are normally fought in strict privacy -- no stars want it known that their paycheck is in retrograde, and their agent wants it known even less -- but studios are starting to become bolder.
This month, a salary spat between Mr. Washington and 20th Century Fox broke into public view. Variety reported -- and two executives with knowledge of the negotiations confirmed -- that Fox wanted to pay the actor about $16 million to appear in "Unstoppable," a thriller about a runaway train. Mr. Washington, who normally makes $20 million a picture, said no. Fox also sought pay cuts from producers, other actors and the director.
Several days later the studio and star came to an agreement, but it involved Mr. Washington's giving up millions of dollars in upfront payment.
There are also some specific explanations about the recent crop of failures. Several of these stars are aging while others have allowed their fans to move on by working infrequently (Ms. Roberts). Others may be suffering by refusing to do certain types of publicity (Mr. Sandler, Mr. Murphy) or wearing their routine too thin (Mr. Ferrell).
This weekend, Mr. Pitt has an opportunity to stop the bleeding. His "Inglourious Basterds," an R-rated Nazi thriller directed by Quentin Tarantino, arrived in theaters Friday. Harvey Weinstein and The Weinstein Company built the marketing campaign for the film almost entirely around Mr. Pitt.
And the actor may pull it off -- kind of. Mr. Weinstein contends that Mr. Pitt's drawing power is not remotely in question. "Brad Pitt is a super-superstar at the apex of his popularity, and he's a large part of why people want to see this movie," he said.
Indeed, services that track consumer interest in movies predict that "Inglourious Basterds" will sell an estimated $25 million to $30 million in tickets over its three-day opening. While anything could still happen, that result would be solid for this kind of movie (extremely violent, independently made) and on par with Mr. Tarantino's "Kill Bill" movies, which blossomed into hits.
But a $25 million tally would fall in the middle of Mr. Pitt's own opening-weekend track record when adjusted for inflation, on par with "The Mexican" from 2001. That would be enough to firmly keep Mr. Pitt's wattage from dimming, but probably not enough to end the hand-wringing in Hollywood over star power, veteran producers say.
Talent agents argue that stars are not to blame, faulting script concepts that fail to translate to the screen, poor release dates, awkward marketing or ill-advised efforts by popular actors to stretch in new directions.
But many people think a new phenomenon has popped up in recent months to undercut stars. The surge in social networking services like Twitter and Facebook, not to mention text messaging, has made it much harder for studios to persuade consumers that the movies are worth their time.
"You look around the theater and can see the glow, not on people's faces from watching the movie, but on their chins -- from the BlackBerrys and iPhones," said Mr. Guber. "They are immediately telling their friends whether it's worth their time. And the answer to that, more often than not, seems to be no."

Full text: IN nature, every action has consequences, a phenomenon called the butterfly effect. These consequences, moreover, are not necessarily proportional. For example, doubling the carbon dioxide we belch into the atmosphere may far more than double the subsequent problems for society. Realizing this, the world properly worries about greenhouse emissions.
The butterfly effect reaches into the financial world as well. Here, the United States is spewing a potentially damaging substance into our economy -- greenback emissions.
To be sure, we've been doing this for a reason I resoundingly applaud. Last fall, our financial system stood on the brink of a collapse that threatened a depression. The crisis required our government to display wisdom, courage and decisiveness. Fortunately, the Federal Reserve and key economic officials in both the Bush and Obama administrations responded more than ably to the need.
They made mistakes, of course. How could it have been otherwise when supposedly indestructible pillars of our economic structure were tumbling all around them? A meltdown, though, was avoided, with a gusher of federal money playing an essential role in the rescue.
The United States economy is now out of the emergency room and appears to be on a slow path to recovery. But enormous dosages of monetary medicine continue to be administered and, before long, we will need to deal with their side effects. For now, most of those effects are invisible and could indeed remain latent for a long time. Still, their threat may be as ominous as that posed by the financial crisis itself.
To understand this threat, we need to look at where we stand historically. If we leave aside the war-impacted years of 1942 to 1946, the largest annual deficit the United States has incurred since 1920 was 6 percent of gross domestic product. This fiscal year, though, the deficit will rise to about 13 percent of G.D.P., more than twice the non-wartime record. In dollars, that equates to a staggering $1.8 trillion. Fiscally, we are in uncharted territory.
Because of this gigantic deficit, our country's "net debt" (that is, the amount held publicly) is mushrooming. During this fiscal year, it will increase more than one percentage point per month, climbing to about 56 percent of G.D.P. from 41 percent. Admittedly, other countries, like Japan and Italy, have far higher ratios and no one can know the precise level of net debt to G.D.P. at which the United States will lose its reputation for financial integrity. But a few more years like this one and we will find out.
An increase in federal debt can be financed in three ways: borrowing from foreigners, borrowing from our own citizens or, through a roundabout process, printing money. Let's look at the prospects for each individually -- and in combination.
The current account deficit -- dollars that we force-feed to the rest of the world and that must then be invested -- will be $400 billion or so this year. Assume, in a relatively benign scenario, that all of this is directed by the recipients -- China leads the list -- to purchases of United States debt. Never mind that this all-Treasuries allocation is no sure thing: some countries may decide that purchasing American stocks, real estate or entire companies makes more sense than soaking up dollar-denominated bonds. Rumblings to that effect have recently increased.
Then take the second element of the scenario -- borrowing from our own citizens. Assume that Americans save $500 billion, far above what they've saved recently but perhaps consistent with the changing national mood. Finally, assume that these citizens opt to put all their savings into United States Treasuries (partly through intermediaries like banks).
Even with these heroic assumptions, the Treasury will be obliged to find another $900 billion to finance the remainder of the $1.8 trillion of debt it is issuing. Washington's printing presses will need to work overtime.
Slowing them down will require extraordinary political will. With government expenditures now running 185 percent of receipts, truly major changes in both taxes and outlays will be required. A revived economy can't come close to bridging that sort of gap.
Legislators will correctly perceive that either raising taxes or cutting expenditures will threaten their re-election. To avoid this fate, they can opt for high rates of inflation, which never require a recorded vote and cannot be attributed to a specific action that any elected official takes. In fact, John Maynard Keynes long ago laid out a road map for political survival amid an economic disaster of just this sort: "By a continuing process of inflation, governments can confiscate, secretly and unobserved, an important part of the wealth of their citizens.... The process engages all the hidden forces of economic law on the side of destruction, and does it in a manner which not one man in a million is able to diagnose."
I want to emphasize that there is nothing evil or destructive in an increase in debt that is proportional to an increase in income or assets. As the resources of individuals, corporations and countries grow, each can handle more debt. The United States remains by far the most prosperous country on earth, and its debt-carrying capacity will grow in the future just as it has in the past.
But it was a wise man who said, "All I want to know is where I'm going to die so I'll never go there." We don't want our country to evolve into the banana-republic economy described by Keynes.
Our immediate problem is to get our country back on its feet and flourishing -- "whatever it takes" still makes sense. Once recovery is gained, however, Congress must end the rise in the debt-to-G.D.P. ratio and keep our growth in obligations in line with our growth in resources.
Unchecked carbon emissions will likely cause icebergs to melt. Unchecked greenback emissions will certainly cause the purchasing power of currency to melt. The dollar's destiny lies with Congress.

Abstract: Citing misconduct by prosecutors, a federal appeals court on Tuesday overturned the conviction of the former chief executive of Brocade Communications Systems on charges related to the illegal backdating of stock options. Henry Klehm III, a corporate governance lawyer at the law firm Jones Day who was not involved in the case, said the appeals court's decision was written narrowly to address the specific issue of prosecutorial misconduct in this case, and that the opinion otherwise described the case against Mr. Reyes as valid.

Full text: CORRECTION: An article on Wednesday about the overturning on appeal of the conviction of Gregory L. Reyes, former chief executive of Brocade Communications Systems, on charges relating to the illegal backdating of stock options misstated the reason for an accounting rule that requires the options be recorded as a noncash expense. The rule is to guard against the possible inflation of a company's profit, not its revenue.
Citing misconduct by prosecutors, a federal appeals court on Tuesday overturned the conviction of the former chief executive of Brocade Communications Systems on charges related to the illegal backdating of stock options.
The court ordered a new trial for Gregory L. Reyes, the former chief executive.
The sharply worded rebuke by a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco upends the first major conviction of a corporate executive in a backdating case.
The discovery of widespread backdating at companies, ranging from giants like Apple to small firms like Take-Two Interactive Software, prompted regulators to investigate more than 100 companies. More than a dozen executives have been convicted on criminal charges, and several others have settled. Some cases are still pending, including charges against top executives at Broadcom and KB Home.
The 2007 conviction of Mr. Reyes on 10 criminal counts, including conspiracy and fraud, surprised Silicon Valley, where some firms routinely used backdating to enhance employee compensation.
In backdating, a company retroactively changes the listed grant date of options, usually to a day when the stock was at a low price. The practice allows the option recipients to reap greater gains upon exercising the options.
Backdating in and of itself is not illegal. But accounting rules require the company to record such grants as a noncash expense. Otherwise, companies could greatly inflate their revenue through improper backdating.
Studies have shown that backdating was not uncommon. At hundreds of companies, options grants were listed at historical lows for their stock prices -- far too often to have been simple statistical anomalies.
Brocade eventually revised its financial statements from 1999 to 2004, with some quarterly profits instead becoming losses. The company, a maker of network storage equipment, paid $167 million to settle separate lawsuits brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission and investors.
Mr. Reyes resigned as Brocade's chief executive in 2005 after the company disclosed that it had found accounting irregularities tied to its stock-option grants. His sentence of 21 months in prison and a $15 million fine was seen as an indication of how strongly the courts felt about the severity of backdating as a crime.
But in a 21-page opinion written by Judge Mary M. Schroeder, the appeals court found that prosecutors had misled the jury by saying that Brocade's finance department did not know that the stock options in question had been improperly recorded in the company's books. Brocade finance employees had actually told investigators that they were aware of the practice.
"Deliberate false statements by those privileged to represent the United States harm the trial process and the integrity of our prosecutorial system," Judge Schroeder wrote. "We do not lightly tolerate a prosecutor asserting as a fact to the jury something known to be untrue or, at the very least, that the prosecution had very strong reason to doubt."
Still, she wrote, the defense lawyers for Mr. Reyes also acted aggressively, and the prosecutor's misconduct was not egregious enough to warrant throwing out the case entirely.
Jack Gillund, a spokesman for the United States attorney's office in San Francisco, said, "We are disappointed by the Ninth Circuit's decision, and we are analyzing the court's opinion."
Prosecutors could ask a larger appeals panel to reconsider the case, retry Mr. Reyes, or drop the charges.
Richard Marmaro, a lawyer for Mr. Reyes, wrote in an e-mail message, "We're elated by the court's decision." He declined further comment.
Henry Klehm III, a corporate governance lawyer at the law firm Jones Day who was not involved in the case, said the appeals court's decision was written narrowly to address the specific issue of prosecutorial misconduct in this case, and that the opinion otherwise described the case against Mr. Reyes as valid.
"While the prosecutor made a bad mistake in closing arguments, the court found the case overall to be strong and sent the case for a new trial," he said.
But the case against Mr. Reyes was complicated, with the jury taking seven days to deliberate. Making the prosecution's job harder was that Mr. Reyes did not benefit directly from the backdating, although the value of his own holdings grew artificially because Brocade did not properly expense the options in question.
The case of Mr. Reyes took several twists and turns. One Brocade employee, Elizabeth Moore, recanted her testimony that the finance department was unaware of the backdating.
In its Tuesday ruling, the appeals court also upheld the conviction of Stephanie Jensen, Brocade's former vice president for human resources, but ordered her to be resentenced.
Last year, she was sentenced to four months in prison and given a $1.25 million fine for helping Mr. Reyes in the backdating scheme, but the court found that the trial judge had improperly enhanced her sentence because of actions by her defense attorney.

Full text: CORRECTION: The Generation B column last Sunday, about the author's delayed acknowledgment of Sixties culture, referred incorrectly to student draft deferments during the Vietnam War era. They were issued until September 1971, and college students at that time were allowed to keep their deferments for the rest of that school year. The deferments did not last until the draft ended in 1973.
THAT legendary summer of '69 I was 17. What a moment in history to be a baby boomer: the Stonewall riots, the moon walk, the Manson murders, Woodstock. A youth movement unlike any before. By the time we got to Woodstock, we were half a million strong -- although I do want to make it clear, I cannot vouch for that.
I wasn't there.
I wasn't at the Stonewall riots, either, and while I can't be sure, it's possible that in the summer of '69 I didn't know what a homosexual was. (If I did, it was from health class.)
The Manson murders? If it wasn't on the sports pages, unlikely I was paying attention.
The sexual revolution? I was still a year away from heavy petting.
The drug culture? Did not smoke a joint that summer nor did I know anyone who had.
The Vietnam War? Did not have an opinion that summer.
I did see the moon walk, though it was not a psychedelic experience for me. I watched it at home with my mom.
That summer 40 years ago, the 1960s may have been exploding all around me, but I was not yet ready for the '60s and would not get to the '60s until the early '70s. This made things very different for me than for boomers who were just a few years older and felt the full force of the '60s in the '60s.
Geography was not my problem; I did not grow up in rural Alaska. I grew up in Quincy, Mass., a suburb so close to Boston, I could ride my bike to Fenway Park, where I worked nights selling hot dogs that summer. (Days, I dug ditches for the Quincy sewer department.)
This was partly about class. Quincy was a blue-collar shipyard town, and the '60s arrived there about five years after they did in liberal, upscale areas like Newton and Brookline, Mass.
I graduated from North Quincy High in 1970, and socially, the big deal was going to Wollaston Beach on Saturday night and drinking a case of beer. In 1970, our class officers had short hair and posed for the yearbook in neckties. That year, a group of thug athletes beat up one of the few boys at our school with long hair.
In just two years' time, when my brother graduated, in 1972, dope was all over the high school and all the class officers had long hair.
If you were a boomer born in 1946 and graduated college in '68, you were ripe for Vietnam.
If you were a boomer born in 1951, as I was, by the time you graduated college in 1974, the war was all but over. In 1969 a draft lottery was put in effect, and there was talk -- just talk, it turned out -- of abolishing college deferments. Had I been drafted out of high school in 1970, I'm fairly certain I would have gone. Not out of any conviction. I was too unformed, lived too insular a life to think I had an alternative like going to Canada or finding a doctor to lie for me. I would have regarded Vietnam as an experience that built character. It would never have occurred to me that I was the kind of person who could die there.
Of course, they didn't get rid of college deferments, and even if they had, it turned out I wouldn't have had to go -- my lottery number was 320 out of 365.
Circumstance. Luck. Timing. We don't like to think those things can hold sway, but writing a column about my generation, I've come to think what a big difference even a year can make in how a life takes shape.
The boomers at Harvard in the spring of 1969 faced choices that we boomers who arrived as freshman in September 1970 never had to face.
In April '69, hundreds of Harvard students were arrested after occupying University Hall to protest the war and R.O.T.C. on campus. In the spring of 1970, after the invasion of Cambodia and the Kent State deaths, students shut down hundreds of universities nationwide.
That fall of 1970, a group of freshmen called a meeting that attracted much of our class, to discuss a plan for political action. The idea was to carry on from the classes before ours.
I don't remember how I had come to it, but by that meeting, I was against the war. Probably, as much as anything, it was just getting out of Quincy and seeing some of the world -- four of us spent that summer before college traveling cross-country in my friend's Rambler. This I remember: At the end of that summer of '70 I was back in Quincy for my precollege physical with our family doctor. And this man who had come to our house with his black bag when I was sick and made me well, was now lecturing me about not wasting time at Harvard protesting, while I quietly seethed.
That fall of 1970, we wanted to do something, we had to do something, but the class of '74 couldn't think of anything to do. The call to action fizzled.
During my college years, I marched in a few antiwar protests, but nothing that felt like we were changing anything.
On a personal level, that first semester of my freshman year, I did catch up with the '60s on several fronts, mostly at small smoky parties or in the privacy of a dorm room. When a girl who showed me what came after heavy petting dumped me, I played Donovan's "Catch the Wind" so many times a guy on the floor below complained.
Not only did I meet actual gay people but I also learned that one of those guys in the North Quincy High 1970 class officer photo with a tie and short hair, who had also come to Harvard -- yes, he was.
I wore my hair long and embraced the idealism and activism of the summer of '69, though in a safer, more mainstream form. I became a big brother to a boy who lived at Columbia Point, the worst housing project in Boston, and volunteered in the first and only political campaign of my life -- going door to door for George McGovern.
Well into the 1970s, my classmates continued to talk like it was the summer of '69. During tryouts for the college paper, The Crimson, we'd paste our articles in a big scrapbook, and the editors would critique them. God forbid you wrote "Vietcong" in an article (the American name for the armed resistance in South Vietnam) instead of "National Liberation Front" (the North Vietnamese name) -- you'd lose points for being an imperialist lackey.
Midway through college, the economy turned bad for the class of '74. Unemployment was 7.2 percent; inflation 8.8 percent. Jobs in academia dried up. Jobs in general dried up. Suddenly, a large portion of our class, including many anti-imperialists, decided to go to law, medical and business schools.
I was part of a minority looking for work, and felt lucky after my junior year, in the summer of '73, to land an internship at The Times-Union in Rochester, N.Y.
Rochester, I was quite sure, was middle America -- Kodak, Xerox, Bausch & Lomb. As much as my heart was in the '60s, I needed to make a good impression, and got a haircut so I'd blend in.
When I showed up for work that first day, I was embarrassed. Looking around I could see I had the shortest hair in the newsroom; the '60s had reached Rochester long before I did.
I was also the worst of the five interns starting out. They had all learned their craft at journalism schools; Harvard didn't offer anything as mundane as journalism, and the articles I was writing in Rochester didn't tap into my knowledge of the National Liberation Front.
I started with obits, got the hang of it, and by the end of the summer, after a week spent writing articles about the county fair -- the championship lemon meringue pie, the six new piglets in the 4-H tent -- I had learned to write a feature story. The Monroe County fair, of all places, was where I fell in love with reporting and writing.
Before I returned to Cambridge for my senior year, one of the veteran reporters invited me to his home for dinner. Sitting in his living room, over hors d'oeuvres, he and I and his wife, a bank vice president, shared a joint, had a good laugh about my Rochester haircut, and then we all sat down for a nice dinner.

Full text: Wall Street tumbled by the most since early July on Friday as profit-taking investors worried that stock markets had raced too far ahead of the struggling real economy.
Stocks soared on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve offered a more optimistic reading on the economy. But on Friday they gave back much of those gains as a survey of consumer attitudes showed that people were getting more pessimistic about the job market and the overall economy. And a new report on consumer prices showing that inflation remained under control also offered a reminder that with so much weakness in the economy, many businesses simply did not have the ability to raise prices.
After cutting its losses in the final hour, the Dow Jones industrial average closed at 9,321.40, down 76.79 points, or 0.8 percent. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was down 0.9 percent. The index fell modestly this week after four weeks of gains. The Nasdaq composite index was off by 1.2 percent as technology shares weakened.
"You're seeing the reality that maybe it's gone too far too fast," said Larry Adam, chief market strategist at Deutsche Bank. "It's just a necessary pullback."
Shares of basic-materials companies and industrial producers declined as the price of oil fell by $3.01, to $67.51 a barrel.
The North Carolina-based regional bank BB&T rose nearly 9 percent after reports said it would be stepping in to take over deposits of the struggling Colonial BancGroup, which warned in a regulatory filing that there was "substantial doubt" about its future. The BB&T takeover of Colonial was confirmed in an announcement by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation on Friday evening.
Bank of America and Citigroup also rose while most other big financial firms and regional banks slipped.
Some analysts said the market was bumping against a ceiling as investors tried to decide whether stock prices would continue higher or peel back some of their gains in a late summer slump.
The S.& P. 500 crossed 1,000 points early last week, hitting that benchmark for the first time since last autumn. But it has stagnated since then, swinging above and below the four-digit threshold.
"We just hit a brick wall," said Todd Salamone, senior vice president for research at Schaeffer's Investment Research. "There's been a huge bull-bear fight going on there. You have poor economic data, and before you know it you're back below it."
A muted report on consumer confidence from Reuters and the University of Michigan underscored concerns that battered consumers were not ready to lead the United States out of recession. The consumer confidence index fell to 63.2 in August, its lowest level since March, as consumers said their current economic situation deteriorated and their expectations worsened.
The lower consumer confidence numbers came one day after the government reported that retail spending had fallen 0.1 percent in July as people spent less on electronics, furniture, books and hobbies. People's wealth has been devastated by declines in the housing and stock markets, and Americans are now trying to save more money to rebuild their finances and guard against layoffs and wage cuts.
Interest rates declined for a second straight day. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 7/32, to 100 15/32, and the yield fell to 3.57 percent from 3.59 percent late Thursday.
European shares were also lower. The FTSE 100 index in London declined 41.49 points, or 0.87 percent, to 4,713.97, while the DAX in Frankfurt dropped 92 points, or 1.7 percent, to 5,309.11. The CAC-40 in Paris fell 29.12 points, or 0.83 percent, to 3,495.27.

Full text: Consumer prices in the United States were steady last month, easing concerns for now that the record deficit and huge new government spending would spur inflation.
"It could be a very large long-run problem," said Mickey Levy, chief economist at Bank of America. "But in the near term, it's not a problem at all."
The drift in prices suggests that enormous slack remains in the American economy, even as the recession bottoms out and some industries restart production. Retail sales are sluggish, 14.5 million people are unemployed and many factories and other businesses are still running below capacity.
The Labor Department reported Friday that its Consumer Price Index was unchanged from June on a seasonally adjusted basis, and that prices this summer were 2.1 percent lower than last July, when soaring oil costs drove gasoline to $4 a gallon and lifted the cost of food and other products.
The drop in the last year has been the largest in almost 60 years, occurring as the global economic crisis reduced demand for many goods and services.
"The inflation story was nonsense in an environment where you have such wild excess capacity globally," said Robert Barbera, chief economist at ITG, an investment advisory business. "I think inflation is below 2 percent for the next two years."
In another hopeful sign for the economy, the Federal Reserve reported on Friday that industrial production in the United States rose last month, suggesting that manufacturers and major industries were ramping up assembly lines and increasing output.
The monthly increase of 0.5 percent was the first since October, when production rebounded after Hurricane Ike as refineries and other industries came back on line. Before that, industrial production had not posted a gain since December 2007, the first month of the recession.
Economists had expected no change in consumer prices in July. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, the so-called core rate of inflation rose 0.1 percent, also in line with expectations.
"For all the inflation fear-mongering, the fact remains that prices have, in the near term, declined further rather than turned upwards," Dan Greenhaus, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak, said in a research note. "Such price action comes despite, among other things, a $787 billion stimulus package and $1.75 trillion in asset purchase by the Federal Reserve."
Some economists and investors have warned that the government's rescue plans and big stimulus spending will stoke inflation as the economy heals, setting off worries about the strength of the dollar and rising interest rates.
But economists said that Friday's numbers showed that inflation remained subdued even as oil prices more than doubled since February and interest rates on government bonds crept back from record lows.
The Federal Reserve, in its statement on Wednesday after its two-day meeting, said it expected "that inflation will remain subdued for some time."
In July, retail prices for food and beverages fell 0.2 percent from a month earlier while gasoline prices declined 0.8 percent. Housing costs fell 0.2 percent for the month, and were down 0.7 percent from last year.
The cost of clothing actually rose 0.6 percent, mostly because of increases in the price of shoes and women's apparel.
Transportation and health care costs edged up 0.2 percent.

Full text: WORLD trade, which virtually collapsed last fall, appears to be starting to recover. But the rebound so far is small, providing little evidence that the world economy is about to start growing at a good pace.
The United States reported this week that its exports in June were up 2.2 percent from the previous month. It was the first time in a year that exports had risen for two consecutive months.
As the accompanying chart shows, most countries are now seeing an increase in trade, but volumes remain far below those of a year ago. To offset currency swings, all figures are based on the dollar volume of exports, not adjusted for inflation.
Japan reported that its June exports were up 1.1 percent but were 31 percent below the level of a year ago. Still, that decline was much better than the 42 percent year-over-year decline posted in March.
In the credit crisis that grew severe last fall, both industrial production and world trade fell off much faster than final sales to consumers. That has set the stage for a recovery in trade even if there is none in consumer demand, as shipments are adjusted to final demand.
There is a good chance that exports, particularly those directed to the United States, will pick up significantly over the next few months, as many industries restock inventories. That will especially be true for the automobile industry, which was surprised by the success of the "cash for clunkers" program.
Total American imports of cars, trucks and parts over the first half of 2009 were half those of the same period of 2008, when the American economy was already in recession. Not since 1994 had auto-related imports been so low in the first six months of a year.
China, which is among the first countries to report its trade figures each month, disclosed its July figures this week, showing a 3.7 percent gain on a seasonally adjusted basis. The American share of Chinese exports rose to its highest level since before the recession began, providing a sign that American figures for July will start to show larger gains in imports.
For now, however, the American trade deficit, which seemed like an overwhelming problem a couple of years ago, appears to be much diminished. The trade deficit in goods other than petroleum was under $20 billion in June, the first time that had happened since January 1999.

Full text: Federal officials are scheduled to tour a state prison in rural Michigan on Thursday as a potential site for housing detainees from the prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, a spokeswoman for Gov. Jennifer M. Granholm said Wednesday.
The prison under consideration is a maximum-security facility in Standish, northwest of Detroit, said Elizabeth Boyd, the spokeswoman for Ms. Granholm. It is among eight facilities the state is preparing to close because of reduced revenues.
An administration official said that the visit was intended only to gather information about the facility and that no decisions had been made.
The national debate over where to relocate the detaineeshas been heated since the Obama administration announced a deadline to close the detention center in Guantanamo by January. The logistics of the move has been among the more contentious problems, and the notion of relocating detainees in the United States has provoked alarm in some communities and a bipartisan Congressional protest.
Although the detainees at the Guantanamo prison, which was opened by the Bush administration as part of its counterterrorism policy, are not presumed to be security threats, no state has thus far been friendly to the idea of housing them. And the House and Senate voted in May to bar the resettlement of detainees in this country and stripped an emergency war-spending bill of $50 million for closing Guantanamo until after the administration submitted a detailed plan.
Michigan, however, long-suffering economically, may have more reason than other states to welcome the money that would come with housing detainees.
Michigan has cut 10,000 employees since 2000, leaving it with about as many state workers as it had in the early 1970s. Annual general fund revenues, when adjusted for inflation, have shrunk in all but one of the last nine years. Revenue is expected to be $6.9 billion next year, a level last seen in 1991 (and when inflation adjusted, similar to the 1960s).
Ms. Boyd said the governor would not attend the tour, which is to be led by state corrections officials and attended by officials of the Departments of Defense, Justice and Homeland Security.

Text of Fed Statement On Funds Target Rate

Abstract: The committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period.

Full text: Following is the text of the Federal Reserve's statement on Wednesday announcing it was holding its base federal funds target rate at a record low between zero and 0.25 percent:
Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in June suggests that economic activity is leveling out. Conditions in financial markets have improved further in recent weeks. Household spending has continued to show signs of stabilizing but remains constrained by ongoing job losses, sluggish income growth, lower housing wealth and tight credit. Businesses are still cutting back on fixed investment and staffing but are making progress in bringing inventory stocks into better alignment with sales. Although economic activity is likely to remain weak for a time, the committee continues to anticipate that policy actions to stabilize financial markets and institutions, fiscal and monetary stimulus, and market forces will contribute to a gradual resumption of sustainable economic growth in a context of price stability.
The prices of energy and other commodities have risen of late. However, substantial resource slack is likely to dampen cost pressures, and the committee expects that inflation will remain subdued for some time.
In these circumstances, the Federal Reserve will employ all available tools to promote economic recovery and to preserve price stability. The committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period. As previously announced, to provide support to mortgage lending and housing markets and to improve overall conditions in private credit markets, the Federal Reserve will purchase a total of up to $1.25 trillion of agency mortgage-backed securities and up to $200 billion of agency debt by the end of the year. In addition, the Federal Reserve is in the process of buying $300 billion of Treasury securities. To promote a smooth transition in markets as these purchases of Treasury securities are completed, the committee has decided to gradually slow the pace of these transactions and anticipates that the full amount will be purchased by the end of October. The committee will continue to evaluate the timing and overall amounts of its purchases of securities in light of the evolving economic outlook and conditions in financial markets. The Federal Reserve is monitoring the size and composition of its balance sheet and will make adjustments to its credit and liquidity programs as warranted.
Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Ben S. Bernanke, chairman; William C. Dudley, vice chairman; Elizabeth A. Duke; Charles L. Evans; Donald L. Kohn; Jeffrey M. Lacker; Dennis P. Lockhart; Daniel K. Tarullo; Kevin M. Warsh; and Janet L. Yellen.

Full text: The United States cannot afford to send humans anywhere beyond the space station -- especially Mars -- unless it wants to spend more money.
"You just can't get there," Sally Ride, the former astronaut, said over and over again on Wednesday as she presented calculations of the costs and timetables of various proposed space missions, ranging from establishing a base on the Moon to touring asteroids to landing on Mars.
Dr. Ride told a meeting of a panel that is investigating options for the future of the space program that she was still looking for proof that a human exploration program could be undertaken under the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's present budget.
In an afternoon of rambling discussion and argument on a stage at the International Trade Center in Washington, Norman Augustine, former chief executive of Lockheed Martin and chairman of the panel, said, "If we do want a strong space program, we might have to face up to investing more."
NASA convened the panel in response to a request by President Obama and the Office of Science and Technology Policy in May. They have 19 days left, Dr. Augustine said, to present to Mr. Obama options for human spaceflight. Should NASA continue on the road set by President George W. Bush aimed at a base on the Moon or so something else? This was their last scheduled public meeting.
Among the options the committee has to consider is whether to retire the space shuttle in 2010 as planned, or extend its life to 2011 or beyond, whether to dump the International Space Station in the ocean in 2016 (for which there is no money in the budget), whether to continue developing the Ares 1 and Ares 5 rockets to replace the shuttle, or to build something else -- and, of course, where to go in these shiny new rockets.
Many committee members agreed that political considerations made it likely that the space station would survive and that the space shuttle would probably fly at least until 2011, and that some options should show that, but they argued about what other options should be in "the Chinese menu," in the words of Jeff Greason, chief executive of XCOR Aerospace.
Unable to fit anything into the official budget, Dr. Ride and her colleagues tried to see how various programs would fit into an "unconstrained budget," which would be allowed to overshoot it by up to $3 billion a year, then grow with inflation.
The best fit in that case was something called "Deep Space," which would involve flybys of asteroids, the Moon or Mars and other interesting places in deep space, but not necessarily landing on the Moon or Mars. Under that plan, Dr. Ride reported, there could be missions every other year in the 2020s past asteroids and Mars and even a landing on the Moon by 2029 or 2030.
As the afternoon wore on, the participants wrestled with whether to retain the goal of a direct flight to Mars.
Mr. Greason said that he had dreamed of going to Mars his whole life, but that making a "dash" for Mars would be destructive of the dream, leading to its abandonment the way Americans abandoned the Moon. "I want to go to Mars, but not this way," he said. "I want to go the right way."
But Bohdan Bejmuk, a former Boeing manager and aerospace consultant who helped develop the space shuttle, said, "By God, I think we should go to Mars."
Leroy Chiao, a former astronaut, also argued for keeping Mars as an option. "Let the decision makers know what it would it cost," he said.
In the end, the committee agreed to treat Mars not as an option, but as the end goal of all options.

An Upbeat Fed Views Recession As Near an End

Abstract: According to minutes of the Fed's previous policy meeting in June, some policy makers worried that the central bank's heavy purchases of new Treasury debt would be seen by investors as simply financing the federal government's huge deficits.

Full text: Almost exactly two years after it embarked on what was the biggest financial rescue in American history, the Federal Reserve said on Wednesday that the recession is ending and that it would take a step back toward normal policy.
Though the central bank stopped well short of declaring victory, policy makers issued their most upbeat assessment in more than a year by saying that the downturn appears to have hit bottom and that consumer spending, financial markets and inventory-building by corporations all continued to stabilize.
"Economic activity is leveling out," the Fed's policy-making committee said Wednesday after a two-day meeting, adding that inflation would remain "subdued for some time."
The central bank cautioned that the recovery would be slow and that unemployment was likely to remain high for the next year. It reiterated that it would keep its benchmark short-term interest rate at virtually zero for an extended period.
But it also announced that it would wrap up its program to buy $300 billion worth of Treasury bonds by the end of October. The program was one of several tools invoked to drive down long-term interest rates and indirectly reduce the cost of home mortgages and corporate borrowing.
The move signaled that policy makers were confident enough to remove one of their emergency props for the financial markets.
"In a way, it's more of a thumbs-up than if they had said they were continuing the Treasury-buying," said Edward McKelvey, an economist at Goldman Sachs. "They're saying that things are going according to plan, and that the policy is O.K."
Stock prices, which were already up from Tuesday, ticked up again after the Fed announcement. The Dow Jones industrial average ended the day up 120.16 points, or 1.30 percent, at 9,361.61.
Fed officials made it clear they were still more worried about unemployment than a resurgence of inflation. As they have said for months, they will use "all available tools" to support the economy and will keep the benchmark federal funds rate at "exceptionally low levels" for the foreseeable future. Many analysts predict that the Fed will not raise the federal funds rate, which is the overnight rate at which banks lend reserves to each other, until late next year.
The latest assessment comes two years after the Fed, in August 2007, began the first of its emergency lending programs to banks when credit markets seized up in response to the crisis in the subprime lending market.
The central bank is not yet throttling back its biggest emergency credit programs. The Fed is barely halfway through its plan to buy $1.25 trillion in mortgage-backed securities, a program that directly affects home mortgage rates and has had a much more noticeable effect than the Treasury bond program.
Analysts said the Federal Reserve had entered a wait-and-see period, continuing to supply the economy with cheap money but not expanding or extending the emergency programs beyond what policy makers have already announced.
The government's preliminary estimates show that the economy's downturn slowed markedly in recent months, shrinking only 1 percent in the second quarter compared with 6.4 percent in the first. The rate of job losses has slowed sharply as well, though the nation still lost 247,000 jobs in July.
The most recent forecasts by Fed policy makers say that the economy will begin an unusually slow recovery in the second half of this year and pick up speed only gradually in 2010. Even if all goes according to plan, the Fed envisions that unemployment will climb from its already high level of 9.4 percent and average as much as 9.8 percent through the end of 2010.
Rising productivity rates in the United States are giving the Fed more maneuvering room to keep borrowing costs low without aggravating inflation. The productivity of workers, the amount produced per hour of work, shot up at an annual rate of more than 6 percent in the second quarter and has been climbing throughout the recession.
That is unusual for an economic downturn, but it means that wages have more room to climb before employers start to raise prices for their goods and services.
The Fed's decision to end its program of buying Treasury bonds appears to have reflected both practical and philosophical concerns among some policy makers.
According to minutes of the Fed's previous policy meeting in June, some policy makers worried that the central bank's heavy purchases of new Treasury debt would be seen by investors as simply financing the federal government's huge deficits. That, they feared, would erode the Fed's credibility and heighten inflation expectations.
"Some of those who are less disposed to additional Treasury purchases worry about the perception in the markets that they are motivated by a desire to help the Treasury finance a mountain of debt," wrote Laurence H. Meyer, chief economist at Macroeconomic Advisers, and a former Fed governor, in a note to clients last week.
By contrast, Mr. Meyer said, most policy makers seem to agree that the mortgage-security program strikes at the heart of the economy's biggest problem -- the housing market.
On a practical level, analysts said, the Treasury-buying program never packed as much punch in the markets.
At $300 billion, the Treasury purchases are only one-quarter as big as the mortgage program, and they have equaled only about one-third of the new issuance of Treasury securities, according to Ira Jersey, an interest-rate analyst at Royal Bank of Canada Capital Markets. By contrast, the Fed purchases of government-guaranteed mortgage securities equaled more than 100 percent of new issuance in that market.
Though mortgage rates have edged up in recent weeks, along with other long-term interest rates, the spread between mortgage rates and risk-free Treasury rates has narrowed by almost half since last November.
"The program to buy Treasuries wasn't as effective as some of the other programs, like the mortgage-security program, so ending it made sense," Mr. Jersey said.

Full text: Investors took advantage of a two-day decline on Wall Street to jump back into the market on Wednesday, pushing stock indexes higher as the Federal Reserve offered a more optimistic read on the economy.
As expected, the central bank's Federal Open Market Committee chose not to raise target interest rates from their record lows of nearly zero percent, and its statement said little that investors did not already know.
But it did say that the economy was "leveling out" and that the Fed would end a program to buy $300 billion in longer-term government bonds at the end of October.
"I don't really see anything here to blow our socks off," Dennis G. Cajigas, senior market strategist at Lind-Waldock, said.
Despite rising oil and gold prices and weakness in the dollar, the Fed said it expected that inflation would "remain subdued for some time." Some analysts are predicting that inflation will surge as the government racks up huge new deficits (a record $180.7 billion in July) to finance the economic stimulus program and other projects.
Investors welcomed the Fed's assessment. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 120.16 points, or 1.3 percent, to close at 9,361.61 points, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 11.46 points, or 1.2 percent, to 1,005.81 points. The Nasdaq gained 28.99 points, or 1.5 percent, to 1,998.72 points, helped by Apple and Microsoft.
Financial stocks led the broader market higher, as Citigroup rose 7.9 percent, to $3.98 a share, and the commercial lender CIT Group gained 6.7 percent, to $1.28 a share. Industrial companies like Caterpillar gained ground, and shares of construction companies and builders rose after the luxury home builder Toll Brothers said that lower prices were beginning to attract buyers. Shares of Toll Brothers gained 14 percent, to $23.42.
The Fed's decision to wind down its purchases of government securities, which had aimed to keep interest rates low, caused a stir in bond markets, where Treasury prices fell. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 12/32, to 95 6/32, and the yield rose to 3.72 percent from 3.68 percent late Tuesday.
"Judging by the immediate market sell-off, there were more than a few participants who were hoping for a greater commitment toward Treasury purchases," Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist at MFR, said in a research note.
Although markets wavered this week on some analyst downgrades and more subdued economic figures and profit reports, traders were betting that Wall Street was still headed higher. The major indexes have gained more than 10 percent in the last month on signs that the recession might be ending.
A smaller-than-expected increase in the United States trade deficit bolstered hopes that trade was rebounding after months of contraction. The Commerce Department reported that the trade deficit edged up 4 percent in June, to $27 billion, from $26 billion in May as imports rose for the first time in 11 months.
Exports increased 2 percent in June from May, buoyed by increased demand for semiconductors, civilian aircraft and telecommunications equipment. On Wednesday, shares of Boeing were up 2.1 percent, at $46.34, and shares of Intel closed almost 1 percent higher, at $18.81.
In Europe, the FTSE 100 in London rose almost 1 percent, to 4,716.76 points, the DAX in Frankfurt gained 1.2 percent, to 5,350.09, while the CAC 40 in Paris was up 1.5 percent, at 3,507.24.
Most exchanges in Asia declined Wednesday, led by the Chinese markets. Many analysts have said that a technical correction was overdue in China, where stocks have jumped 80 percent since the start of the year.
"We have reached valuations that we normally reach about three or four years into a recovery -- but we're only six months into a recovery now," Markus Rosgen, head of regional strategy at Citigroup in Hong Kong, said.
Oil prices settled higher, up 71 cents, to $70.16 a barrel.
Following are the results of Wednesday's Treasury auction of 10-year notes:

Full text: For the first time since the decade began, Americans are having fewer babies, and some experts are blaming the economy.
"It's the recession," said Andrew Hacker, a sociologist at Queens College of the City University of New York. "Children are the most expensive item in every family's budget, especially given all the gear kids expect today. So it's a good place to cut back when you're uncertain about the future."
In 2007, the number of births in the United States broke a 50-year-old record high, set during the baby boom. But last year, births began to decline nationwide, by nearly 2 percent, according to provisional figures released last week.
Those figures from the National Center for Health Statistics, indicate that births declined in all but 10 states in 2008 (most of them in a Northern belt where the recession was generally less severe) compared with the year before. Over all, 4,247,000 births were recorded in 2008, 68,000 fewer than the year before.
California logged 14,500 fewer births than in 2007, a 2.6 percent decline and the first since 2001, when the state struggled with job losses in Silicon Valley that led to layoffs in distribution, construction and other sectors.
Early figures for 2009 appear to confirm the correlation with the recession. As more families were feeling the effects of layoffs and economic uncertainty, births decreased even faster.
In Arizona, births declined about 3 percent in 2008, the first annual decrease since an economic downturn in 1991. In the first six months of 2009, 7 percent fewer babies were born compared with the year before. The state's population bubble burst and the jobless rate rose from 5.5 percent to 8.7 percent in the 12 months ending in June.
In the first three months of 2009, births also declined 7 percent in Florida, another state where the economy took a tumble.
"It may be that many couples saw it coming," said Carl Haub, senior demographer for the Population Reference Bureau.
Stephanie Coontz, a professor at Evergreen State College in Olympia, Wash., and research director for the Council on Contemporary Families, a research and advocacy group, said, "We probably can't prove it yet, but I agree."
"That's what happened in the Great Depression," Professor Coontz said, "and although in some periods since then, we have sometimes seen women decide to have a baby if they get laid off, that decision is usually only made if the husband is working and his job seems secure.
"More than 80 percent of the job losses in this recession have been borne by men," Professor Coontz added. "There are a lot of families where a maternity leave would mean that no income at all was coming in."
Historically, birth rates have fluctuated with the economy. Record lows were recorded during two economic crises: the Depression in the 1930s and the Arab oil embargo in the 1970s.
By the 1970s, birth rates were also affected by the rise of feminism and easier access to contraceptives and to abortion. But would they have dropped as low as they did, Mr. Haub asked, without "the added impetus of inflation, not to mention long lines at the gas station?"
"While that question can never be definitively answered," he said, "we do know that the economic setting hardly seems conducive to starting families or having additional children. Double-digit inflation during the 1970s made two-earner, two-career families a virtual necessity for many."
Stephanie J. Ventura, chief of the reproductive statistics branch of the National Center for Health Statistics, said, "We've had these bumps and drops in the past, but 2009 will be critical."
Mr. Haub agreed. "If the economic crisis can be given a start date of early 2008," he said, "then evidence of a slump in the birth rate might become apparent as early as late 2008, but could not be really conclusive until well into 2009."
"It is certainly too soon to tell if this economic crisis will result in a sharp drop in the birth rate," he said, "but all the measures and indicators, along with the collapse of the mainstays of the economy, are much worse than in the 1970s."
In 2006 and 2007, the National Center for Health Statistics, part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, recorded a birth rate of 14.3 per thousand people. That number declined to 13.9 in 2008 (most sharply near the end of the year).
The fertility rate among women 15-to-44 years old, which rose from 68.7 per 1,000 in 2006 to 69.2 in 2007, dipped to 68.4 in 2008.

Full text: To the Editor:
Re "Curbing Runaway Health Inflation" (editorial, Aug. 2):
Covering more Americans with a public health plan could actually be the "game changer" that can "bend down the cost curve" of health care. A sensible health reform plan that coordinates and simplifies all government health programs like Medicare, Medicaid and the proposed public option with one easy-to-understand set of rules would reduce confusion and duplicity, and save money.
Skillfully managed, an organized government health program could significantly reduce costs by negotiating lower reimbursement rates as a volume purchaser of services for more than 100 million consumers.
As a former health fraud investigator, I understand that up until now many government health programs have been inefficient, ineffective and easy targets for fraud and abuse. But with meaningful modifications, government health plans could compete favorably with the best private plans, provide an affordable choice to uninsured Americans and significantly reduce runaway health inflation.

To the Editor:
Your editorial discusses the difficulties in reducing health care costs. But consideration of a few specific areas may facilitate efforts to reduce expenditures, including these:

The high overhead costs of for-profit insurance companies.

The expenditures forced on doctors to comply with the requirements of dealing with so many insurance plans.

The high costs of malpractice insurance.

The use of expensive diagnostic tests instead of taking a comprehensive history and doing a complete physical examination.

The extraordinary amounts of costs associated with treatment of a few specific diseases and with treatment of patients in the last six months of life.
The first two would probably be addressed most effectively by a single-payer system. The third involves comprehensive changes in medical liability laws, the fourth a return to the way medicine used to be practiced and the fifth a re-evaluation of issues of ethics and cost-effectiveness.
Unfortunately, each of these items introduces at least one 800-pound gorilla into the room. But if you want to increase coverage and to reduce costs, they can't be ignored.

To the Editor:
People fearful that under a national health insurance plan they will be paying additional costs for those now uninsured seem unaware of the fact that they already are.
We all pay the price of care for the uninsured: the ever-rising costs of hospital care, pharmaceuticals, health insurance premiums and government-financed Medicaid -- costs that aren't made known to us in itemized statements.
A. Regina Schulte
Burlington, Wis., Aug. 4, 2009

To the Editor:
There are several important issues discussed in your editorial.
As a family physician for 47 years, I agree that too much money is spent on tests and procedures that do not improve health.
Why is it predicted that it will take 10 years to get everyone covered? I don't recall that it took nearly that long to insure all the elderly when Medicare began.
A relatively few doctors don't accept Medicare because they are underpaid by the Medicare-Medicaid system.
It is clearly evident that the for-profit insurance industry costs our country much more than a public option/universal or single-payer health care system would.
Removing the profits, advertising and expenses of private insurance companies would more than pay for a public option, and no one would be rejected for a pre-existing condition.
Melvin H. Kirschner

To the Editor:
How in the world could one write an editorial about health care inflation without a discussion about the hundreds of billions spent on end-of-life care in this country? I am not talking about compassionate hospice care but worthless high-tech tests, procedures and treatments that extend life but add nothing to quality of life.
Health care reform will surely fail unless someone with guts steps up to the plate to bring this issue to the fore.
Michael Franklin

The writer is a doctor.

To the Editor:
Your editorial provides a look behind the veil that covers the grave cultural chasm that confronts the nation on health care. We have had several decades of "excess excess" in health care.
The effort to restrain the waste and wrongdoing in the system is called rationing. Too many American declare that their "right of choice" entitles them to the privilege of seeking medically unnecessary care that is often also harmful to their health. The physician's power to decide how much and how many tests and procedures is besmirched by a personal profit motive.
A situation in which Americans seek the fountain of youth and physicians are paid by the number of items of service they provide is, on the face of it, self-destructive.
Health care reform, quality care at affordable cost, must find a path around the cultural chasm that more is better.
Glenn Wilson

The writer is professor emeritus of social medicine at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill School of Medicine.

To the Editor:
Universal coverage and cost control are not conflicting aims.
Canada spends 10 percent of gross domestic product on health care, and everyone is covered. The United States spends 16 percent of G.D.P., but tens of millions lack coverage. The cost difference is almost entirely due to higher administrative costs and higher prices, which are directly related to the economics of a multi-payer system.
The lessons from Canada and other countries are clear. If you focus on cost control, you will fail. If you cover everyone because it's decent and just, you will also achieve economic sustainability.
America, it's time to do the right thing and then reap the rich rewards of moral public policy.

Full text: CORRECTION: Because of an editing error, an article last Sunday about the impact of lobbying on President Obama's health care plan omitted the given name and middle initial of a Democratic pollster who gave his impression of a focus group of independent voters. The pollster is Peter D. Hart. A chart with the article misstated the amount of money Johnson & Johnson spent on lobbying in the second quarters of 2008 and 2009 and it erroneously included the company among the health businesses and organizations that increased their spending on lobbying the most in that period. Johnson & Johnson decreased its spending to $1.55 million from $1.7 million in those quarters. It did not increase it from $0.1 to $1.7 million, the amounts reported by the Center for Responsive Politics.
PRESIDENT OBAMA entered the White House challenging Washington's political culture and promising a retooled health care system. Now the persistence of the former threatens his ability to deliver the latter.
Mr. Obama's jampacked domestic agenda, from new rules for Wall Street to limits on carbon emissions, has set off a full-scale lobbying brawl involving the "narrow interests" he derided in his Inaugural Address. The health care fight represents the biggest brawl of all.
The $133 million in lobbying expenditures by health industry interests in the second quarter of 2009 alone -- the most of any sector by far, according to the Center for Responsive Politics -- hardly sounds like the change Mr. Obama or his supporters had in mind. And in fact the strategic course the White House has chosen may have had the unintended effect of increasing the breadth and complexity of the battle involving those interests.
There are two reasons for that. The first is that Mr. Obama's aides, having studied the failure of the health overhaul effort in 1993-94, decided to defer to Congress in assembling legislation rather than hand lawmakers a specific proposal as President Bill Clinton had done. That made Congress the pressure point from the start. And individual members of Congress, lacking the president's clout or bully pulpit, are easier for lobbyists to influence.
Second, the Congressional route has yielded different proposals in various committees rather than a single administration plan. That, in turn, has muffled the clarity of the administration's advocacy, while accelerating the lobbying scramble on Capitol Hill as affected interests fan out in pursuit of multiple targets.
"In 1993, it was more of a 'yes or no' thing," said Howard Paster, then Mr. Clinton's White House lobbyist and now executive vice president the WPP Group, parent company to a host of top Washington lobbying firms. "Now it's 'yes, but,' or 'no, but' or 'on which bill?' You have to go retail -- committee by committee."
Certainly, shifts in the broader political environment have improved Mr. Obama's chance of success, no matter what lobbyists do, and the legislative push did make progress last week. He won the 2008 election with a mandate for change. The remorseless march of health inflation since 1993, by threatening to bankrupt government, businesses and American families alike, has increased unease about the status quo.
Thus major health providers like hospitals and drug companies have reached deals with the White House pledging savings to help finance expanded coverage. The health insurance industry, which ran the famous "Harry and Louise" TV spots attacking the Clinton plan, now runs ads declaring, "Let's fix health care." The American Medical Association, perennial foe of "socialized medicine," has endorsed the plan of House Democratic leaders.
"In 1993-94, you had the whole of K Street united in raising concerns about the consequences of reform," said Karen Ignagni, chief executive of the insurers' lobby America's Health Insurance Plans. "The opposite is true today."
Because of the economic threat posed by the current system's woes, she added, "What unites most of the large organizations is concern about the consequences of not enacting reform."
Indeed, a preponderance of TV ads so far in the health care fight have carried a pro-reform message. But in 2009 the air wars are less relevant because of the continuing diffusion of media outlets.
They are also misleading.
That's because industry interests, while professing support for Mr. Obama's effort in general, are aggressively pressing their objections to particular provisions. The pharmaceutical industry, which spent $68 million on second-quarter lobbying, has worked to extend patent protection for biologic drugs beyond the levels favored by some reform advocates, and to limit the use of price comparisons in studies comparing the effectiveness of different treatments.
Health insurers have lobbied fiercely against a government-run "public option" for health insurance, an Obama priority that key lawmakers have moved to dilute or drop altogether. Their efforts so upset the speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, a strong advocate of the public option, that last week she condemned insurance industry leaders as "villains."
Mr. Obama and Democratic leaders can use such language to push back against health industry lobbyists; it appeals to deep public skepticism about special interests in the capital, especially on the political left. At a focus group sponsored by the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg Public Policy Center last week among independent voters in Towson, Md., a rental agent, Remi Brooke, labeled special interests in Washington as "organized crime"; a graphic designer, Louis Moriconi, added, "We're really at the mercy of the power groups, the lobbyists and the financiers." Both voted for Mr. Obama in 2008.
Yet other strains of public opinion play into the hands of Mr. Obama's adversaries. Recent polls show mounting concern over levels of government spending and deficits -- and fear that hasty action on health care may add to the problem. Republicans, some conservative Democrats, and industry opponents find a ready audience among Americans for their calls to delay.
After conducting the focus group of independent voters, the Democratic pollster Mr. Hart concluded: "These people are just saying, 'slow down. Mr. President.' " That, in fact, has happened, with House and Senate leaders scuttling Mr. Obama's call for floor action before the August Congressional recess.
The question now is whether the delay will scuttle Mr. Obama's ambitions altogether, by allowing opponents of action to turn up the heat when lawmakers return home to their districts. Already, conservative critics on cable television, radio and the Internet have helped create a surprising volume of public criticism so quickly after Mr. Obama's sweeping election victory.
That public criticism represents another tool for the administration's partisan foes and lobbyists alike. Compared with 1993-94, there's "much less health provider hostility, and much greater citizen hostility," said Representative Jim Cooper of Tennessee, one of the so-called Blue Dogs in the House seeking greater cost controls.
The volume of incoming messages "is about wearing out our 12 interns, plus my regular staff," Mr. Cooper concluded. "It's probably going to be a rocky August for everybody."
Liberal activists insist the story will end differently than it did for Mr. Clinton. Richard Kirsch, who directs the liberal lobbying coalition Health Care for America NOW, said field organizers in 43 states were prepared to ensure that advocates for reform were heard in the scores of town meetings that lawmakers will conduct.
"This time the reform community is ready to go," added Ralph Neas, a former civil rights lobbyist who now heads the bipartisan National Coalition on Health Care. That includes efforts to mobilize "grass-tops" opinion leaders in individual Congressional districts, as well as "grass-roots" voters.
Another danger, however, is an erosion in the expectation of Congressional action. This expectation has encouraged key health industry players, in Mr. Kirsch's words, to try to "thread the needle to get reform passed that protects their profits." If prospects dim, that dynamic could reverse, tempting industry groups to abandon the effort altogether -- forcing the White House to lobby the lobbyists to remain on board. But no one is counting on any diminution in the determination or ability of health care lobbyists to make their case on Capitol Hill.
Mr. Obama promised in the campaign to limit the influence of lobbyists, and instituted new restrictions on their ability to join his administration. Washington veterans say the impact of those moves so far, however, has been confined to the White House. They have been largely limited to depriving Mr. Obama of the services of some Democrats disqualified from administration service because of past lobbying for corporations or liberal interests.
"In general, the view of lobbying is that it's just as effective on the Hill as ever," said Mr. Paster, the former Clinton lobbyist.
As a Democrat, Mr. Paster said he remained optimistic that Congress would pass a health care bill that Mr. Obama could claim as a significant political victory. But "significant in terms of changing" the health care system? he asked. "I worry about that a lot."

Full text: This year's effort to reform health care revolves around two powerful, conflicting imperatives. One is to cover tens of millions of uninsured Americans. The other is to absorb the enormous cost of that plan -- which could reach $1 trillion over 10 years -- without increasing the budget deficit in the next decade or setting the nation on a course that will drive up deficits later.
It is easier to see how to accomplish the first task than the second. But Congress should not slow the push for near-universal coverage while it looks for ways to apply the brakes to the growth in costs. We can be virtually certain that the reforms enacted will be deficit-neutral over the first 10 years. President Obama and Democratic leaders will find cuts in Medicare and raise sufficient taxes to offset the initial cost of insurance expansion.
It is much harder to find ways to slow inflation in health care costs. Peter Orszag, Mr. Obama's budget director, has been searching for what he calls "game changers" that can "bend down the cost curve" in coming years. The question is how well he and Congressional champions of health care reform have succeeded.
WHY IT'S IMPORTANTThe skyrocketing cost of health care is driving up federal deficits, threatening to bankrupt Medicare, forcing employers to cut or drop benefits, and leaving workers and their families with unaffordable bills. Even a relatively small reduction in the average annual growth rate over the next decade -- from, say, 6.2 percent to 4.7 percent -- could save more than $2 trillion for the health care system and hundreds or thousands of dollars for the average family. There is an enormous amount of money in the health care system, much of it spent on tests and procedures that do not improve health. It should be possible to wring out some of that spending.
HOW CAN WE JUDGE SUCCESS? Douglas Elmendorf, director of the Congressional Budget Office, testified in mid-July that he saw no fundamental changes offered by the bills then emerging that would reduce the trajectory of federal health spending significantly. The implication was that the pending bills could actually make deficits bigger after the initial break-even decade. That's because covering the uninsured would increase federal spending and a high rate of medical inflation applied to that larger base would make future deficits worse. However, Mr. Elmendorf was looking only at bills that had cleared committees, which did not include one still being fashioned by the pivotal Senate Finance Committee.
Senator Max Baucus, the Democrat who heads that committee, revealed last week that the C.B.O. had evaluated a draft of his bill and concluded that it would cover 95 percent of all Americans, for a cost below $900 billion, and would actually start reducing the deficit in 2019. That is better than the administration's goal of being deficit-neutral in that final year, but we will not know for sure until the C.B.O. issues a verdict on a final bill.
The budget office provides vitally important guidance to Congress, but focuses primarily on how new legislation might affect federal spending and federal deficits. The office gives only a cursory glance at how reforms might cut costs for the overall system and yield savings for employers, families and state and local governments, the issue that concerns most people.
Moreover, the office makes middle-of-the road estimates of cost and more pessimistic estimates of savings. That makes sense (lawmakers and government agencies routinely exaggerate the virtues of their proposals), but it makes it harder to evaluate proposed innovations.
Respected analysts who are not bound by the C.B.O.'s conservatism have projected significant savings from reforms that the C.B.O. scores poorly. The Commonwealth Fund, a research organization, and David Cutler, a Harvard health economist, separately estimate that an array of reforms could save the government hundreds of billions of dollars in the first decade and the health care system even more. These estimates, coming from advocates of reform, may be too rosy, but underscore the point that the C.B.O. may undervalue savings.
POTENTIAL GAME CHANGERS It seems hard to believe that over the long haul the introduction of electronic medical records will not save substantial money. It would help eliminate the costly repetition of tests, and prevent medication errors that harm patients and lead to costly hospitalization. But it takes money to get started (Mr. Obama's stimulus package calls for $50 billion over five years) and time to overcome physicians' reluctance. Savings in the first decade, if any, are likely to be small.
So, too, it seems likely that a stimulus investment of $1.1 billion in comparative effectiveness research to gauge which medicines and procedures work best is likely to pay off in future decades.
The approach has been wrongly portrayed as an effort by government bureaucrats to dictate "cookbook" medicine that will prevent doctors from doing what's best for their patients and lead to rationing of care. More than 60 physicians' groups have urged Congress to make comparative effectiveness research an important component of reform. They believe the information would help doctors and patients understand which treatments work best. In some cases, the better treatments might be more expensive, in others less. Either way, patients benefit.
And so it goes, through such ideas as changing Medicare's payment incentives to encourage better care not just more care, and to encourage new arrangements of doctors and hospitals that might control costs and provide more coordinated care than the fee-for-service system does. All will take time to bear fruit.
TAXES One way to keep deficits in check would be to impose taxes within the health care system instead of more broadly, which should ensure that revenues increase at the rate of health care inflation. A tax on the value of an employer's contribution to insurance could lead beneficiaries to choose cheaper policies and think twice before undergoing costly tests. We have been leery of recommending a tax that would affect many workers, but a tax on very expensive plans might make sense.
OTHER IDEASThe administration seems to have scoured the health policy literature for ideas, and its proposals reflect the thinking of the nation's leading experts. Most of these ideas would first be tried on a small scale in Medicare -- to see if they reduced costs while improving or at least maintaining the quality of care -- before being adopted on a wide scale in government programs. Ideas that work for Medicare would presumably migrate out to the private sector.
We believe that some of the reforms in pending legislation could be strengthened. Both public and private insurance plans, for example, should be allowed -- not forbidden -- to base reimbursement policies on comparative effectiveness findings. But for the most part, the nation is embarking on a long-term experiment to see what works, so small-scale tests and pilot programs seem appropriate.
THE OVERSEERWith so much uncertainty, it seems imperative to ensure that the government can change course rapidly to drop approaches that do not work and expand approaches that do. Proposals have been made to create an independent commission of experts, responsible to either the president or Congress, to perform this function at a step removed from the distorting influences of political lobbying.
It is a good idea, if the commission has sufficient power and resources to do an effective job. The panel should be directed to pursue both cost reduction and quality improvement. It should be given cost reduction targets to meet and a mandate to impose across-the-board cuts in Medicare if it falls short. It should have sufficient resources to evaluate and sponsor studies, a membership beholden to no special interest, and be insulated from political pressure by requiring Congress to approve or reject recommendations as a package, without fighting over individual items of interest to lobbyists.
WRONG-HEADED CRITICISM The Republican Party has started a campaign charging that President Obama is conducting a dangerous and reckless experiment in health care reform that will damage the economy, kill jobs, drive up health care costs, and harm patients. That is a bit hard to take after the Bush administration's reckless squandering of government surpluses with tax cuts for wealthy Americans that cost $1.7 trillion over 10 years and an expensive Medicare drug benefit that is projected to cost almost $1 trillion over the next 10 years, without making provisions to cover their costs.
The Obama administration is paying meticulous attention to the need for offsets and new revenues. Most important, it seems headed in the right direction to finally slow the rate of growth in health care spending -- a beast that has defied past efforts to tame it.

Full text: BECAUSE fiscal stimulus has not yet been a striking success, perhaps it's time to consider new monetary remedies for the economy.
That is the argument of Prof. Scott Sumner, an economist at Bentley College in Waltham, Mass., who is little known outside academic circles but whose views have been spreading, thanks to his blog, TheMoneyIllusion (blogsandwikis.bentley.edu/themoneyillusion/).
Professor Sumner proposes that the Federal Reserve make a firm commitment to raising expectations of price inflation to 2 to 3 percent annually.
In his view, policy makers in Washington are doing too much with fiscal policy -- overspending and running excess deficits -- and not doing enough on the monetary side.
While his views are controversial, they are based on some assumptions that are not. It is commonly agreed among economists that deflation brings layoffs and sluggish investment. Yet, energy price shocks aside, we have been seeing downward pressure on prices. Futures markets and Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities -- more precisely, the spread between the yield on TIPS and traditional securities -- suggest current expectations that inflation will remain well under 1 percent. Economists generally agree that this is not ideal, and Professor Sumner urges the Fed to try especially hard to overcome the deflationary pressures.
But how would the Fed accomplish this feat? This is where his recommendations get interesting.
The Fed has already taken some unconventional monetary measures to stimulate the economy, but they haven't been entirely effective. Professor Sumner says the central bank needs to take a different approach: it should make a credible commitment to spurring and maintaining a higher level of inflation, promising to use newly created money to buy many kinds of financial assets if necessary. And it should even pay negative interest on bank reserves, as the Swedish central bank has started to do. In essence, negative interest rates are a penalty placed on banks that sit on their money instead of lending it.
Much to the chagrin of Professor Sumner, the Fed has been practicing the opposite policy recently, by paying positive interest on bank reserves -- essentially, inducing banks to hoard money.
The Fed's balance sheet need not swell to accomplish these aims. Once people believe that inflation is coming, they will be willing to spend more money.
In other words, if the Fed announces a sufficient willingness to undergo extreme measures to create price inflation, it may not actually have to do so. Professor Sumner's views differ from the monetarism of Milton Friedman by emphasizing expectations rather than any particular measure of the money supply.
The Keynesian critique of this remedy is that printing more money won't stimulate the economy because uncertainty has put us in a "liquidity trap," which means that the new money will be hoarded rather than spent. Professor Sumner responds that inflating the currency is one step that just about every government or central bank can take. Even if success is not guaranteed, it seems that we ought to be trying harder.
Arguably, we can live with 2 or 3 percent inflation, especially if it stems the drop in employment. Consistently, Professor Sumner argues that the Fed should have been more aggressive with monetary policy in the summer of 2008, before the economy started its downward spiral. Somewhat tongue in cheek, he once wrote on his blog: "Like a broken clock the monetary cranks are right twice a century; 1933, and today."
It may all sound too simple to be true, but has the status quo been so good as to silence all doubts? Many advocates expected that the $775 billion allocation to fiscal stimulus would be followed rapidly by generous funding for health care and other reforms. But at the moment, the American public, rightly or wrongly, is blanching at higher government spending and higher taxes. In contrast, a Fed stance in favor of mild price inflation need not require higher taxes or larger budget deficits.
While these arguments have not won over the economics profession, neither have they been refuted. Economists like Paul Krugman have suggested that a public Fed policy favoring 2 or 3 percent price inflation isn't politically realistic in today's environment. Still, mild inflation might still be a better shot than hoping for a fiscal stimulus that is big enough, rapid enough and ambitious enough to work.
IF there is a flaw in Professor Sumner's argument, it is that aggregate demand doesn't always drive business recovery. Circa 2007, for reasons of their own making, various sectors of the economy were in a vulnerable position. These included real estate, the automobile industry and retail sales. Higher price inflation would not have solved their problems, which stemmed from basically flawed business models that depended on rampant credit. Still, a different Fed stance might have limited the secondary fallout from the financial crisis.
Of course, there's a risk that inflation could get out of hand and rise above 2 or 3 percent. That said, the Fed has battled inflation successfully in the past, and could do so again if necessary.
Professor Sumner has been working for 20 years on what he hopes will be a definitive economic history of the Great Depression. In this manuscript, tentatively titled "The Midas Curse: Gold, Wages, and the Great Depression," he argues that Sweden in the 1930s made a credible commitment to expansionary monetary policy and had a milder depression as a result.
Professor Sumner's proposals may not be public policy now. But if there is one thing economists should know, it is that we should not underestimate the power of an idea.

Full text: A YEAR ago, the American economy was in recession. Now it may be about to emerge from that downturn.
But if the economy is about to begin growing again, it will be from a very low level. The recession has produced declines far greater than in previous downturns over the past half-century. As a result, the economy may seem to be depressed even after growth resumes.
One area where that can be seen is shipments of durable goods produced by American companies. The rate of such shipments fell by more than 20 percent during this recession, and would have declined further were it not for increased production of weapons.
In no previous downturn since 1958, when the figures began being recorded, had the decline been as much as 14 percent.
The drop is all the more remarkable because such shipments rose at a relatively restrained rate in the preceding period of economic growth, particularly when military sales were excluded.
The accompanying charts show the trend in durable goods spending, for military purposes and for other shipments of durable goods, from 2000 through this June. In June, seasonally adjusted shipments for civilian purposes were 19 percent below the average monthly figure for 2000. Shipments of military items were running 123 percent above the 2000 average.
Those figures are in nominal dollars, not adjusted for inflation. That fact may exaggerate the trend, since prices of some durable goods, like computers, have fallen over the years.
The United States remains primarily a civilian economy. The military now takes about 8 percent of all durable goods, up from 3 percent in 2000.
The charts also show just how much change there was in durable goods orders, and shipments, in the first half of 2009 compared with the first half of 2008.
Over all, shipments for nonmilitary purposes were down by 20 percent, while orders fell by 27 percent. The declines in some areas were much larger, with orders for primary metal products, like iron and steel, plunging by 44 percent. The government cannot track orders for semiconductors because Intel will not provide figures, but shipments in that category were down by a third.
Shipments of commercial aircraft and parts fell by just 7 percent, largely because there are long lead times for such orders, and that helped to keep the shipment decline lower than it would otherwise have been. But orders fell 65 percent.
Those declines are not from boom periods. By early 2008, the recession was on, and durable goods shipments were already coming down. They had peaked the previous summer, and the National Bureau of Economic Research later determined the recession began in December 2007.
In reporting the June figures this week, the Census Bureau said durable goods orders for some categories were up from the previous month, although shipments were still declining. That provided more evidence that the recession might be nearing an end. But a return to high levels of orders, or shipments, may be many months away.

Full text: Behind Democrats' struggle to pay the $1 trillion 10-year cost of President Obama's promise to overhaul the health care system is their collision with another of his well-known pledges: that 95 percent of Americans "will not see their taxes increase by a single dime" during his term.
This will not be the last time that the president runs into a conflict between his audacious agenda and his pay-as-you-go guarantee, when only 5 percent of taxpayers are being asked to chip in. Critics from conservative to liberal warn that Mr. Obama has tied his and Congress's hands on a range of issues, including tax reform and the need to reduce deficits topping $1 trillion a year.
"You can only go to the same well so many times," said Bruce Bartlett, a Treasury official in the Reagan administration.
In the budget, Mr. Obama and Congress have already agreed to let the Bush tax cuts for the most affluent expire after 2010, as scheduled, but to extend them for everyone else. The top rates, now 33 percent and 35 percent, will revert to Clinton-era levels of 36 percent and 39.6 percent.
The critics do not have a beef with the government's taking more from the wealthiest Americans, especially given the growing income gap between the rich and everyone else. They object to doing so for health care over other pressing needs.
"I want to tax the rich to reduce the deficit," said Robert D. Reischauer, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office who heads the Urban Institute, a center-left research group. Similarly, Mr. Bartlett, a conservative analyst who often chastises Republicans for their antitax absolutism, supports overhauling the tax code to raise revenues.
As these analysts recognize, taxing the rich has its limits both economically and politically, such that members of Congress are not likely to tap that well again and again.
Polls show strong majorities supporting higher taxes on those earning more than $250,000 a year, Mr. Obama's target group. Yet some Congressional Democrats are fearful of Republicans' attacks that "soak the rich" tax increases will douse small-business owners, too, even if the number of those affected is far less than Republicans suggest.
Also, higher rates like those in the House health care legislation could lead to tax avoidance schemes, reducing the government's collections and warping business decisions, analysts say.
The House measure calls for surtaxes ranging from 1 percent on annual income of $280,000 to 5.4 percent on income of $1 million and more. The millionaires' surtax would push the top tax rate to 45 percent, the highest since the 1986 tax code overhaul lowered all rates in return for jettisoning a raft of tax breaks for businesses and individuals.
But the effective top rate would be higher still, counting the 2.9 percent Medicare payroll tax and state and local income taxes. In the highest-tax states of Oregon, Hawaii, New Jersey, New York and California, it would be 57 percent, according to the conservative Heritage Foundation.
In the health debate, Democrats emphasize that they are not just raising taxes on the rich, but cutting spending, too, mostly for Medicare payments to doctors, hospitals and insurance companies.
Also, the Democrats say, at least they are trying to pay for the health care initiative, rather than letting the deficit balloon as the Republicans, along with President George W. Bush, did when they created the Medicare prescription drug benefit in 2003. That program will add a projected $803 billion to the national debt in the decade through 2019, according to the White House budget office.
"They charged theirs on the government's credit card," Rahm Emanuel, the White House chief of staff, said of the Republicans.
Even so, Mr. Obama's vow to tax only the rich is a variation "of Bush's policy that nobody has to pay for anything," said Leonard Burman, a veteran of the Clinton administration Treasury and director of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center.
"Democrats are more worried about the deficits," Mr. Burman added, but "they put the burden on a tiny fraction of the population that they figure doesn't vote for them anyway."
Mr. Burman and others recall that in the creation of Social Security and Medicare, Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Lyndon B. Johnson insisted that beneficiaries contribute through payroll taxes, both to finance the programs and to give all Americans a vested interest. The same philosophy should apply to seeking universal health coverage, they say.
"This idea that everything new that government provides ought to be paid for by the top 5 percent, that's a basically unstable way of governing," Mr. Burman said.
Mr. Obama recently dismissed concerns that taxing the rich to pay for health care would foreclose that option when he and Congress turn to deficit reduction. "Health care reform is fiscal reform," he said.
"If we don't do anything on health care inflation, then we might as well close up shop when it comes to dealing with our long-term debt and deficit problems, because that's the driver of it -- Medicare and Medicaid," Mr. Obama said.
But his no-new-tax admonition for most Americans even now complicates the behind-the-scenes work of the panel he established to recommend ways to simplify the tax code and raise more revenue.
The panel, which is led by Paul A. Volcker, a former chairman of the Federal Reserve, is to report by Dec. 4. Overhauling the code, as in 1986, generally creates winners and losers across the board; leaving 95 percent of taxpayers unscathed will not be easy.
That has already proved true in the health care deliberations. Proposals to raise about $50 billion over 10 years by taxing sugared drinks foundered partly because the levy would hit nearly everyone.
And when Congressional leaders opposed Mr. Obama's chief idea for raising revenues -- limiting affluent taxpayers' deductions -- his campaign vow against taxing the middle class made finding an acceptable alternative difficult.
While the president endorsed House Democrats' surtax idea, saying it "meets my principle that it's not being shouldered by families who are already having a tough time," he could not embrace a bipartisan Senate proposal to tax employer-provided health benefits above a certain amount. He had criticized a similar idea as a middle-class tax during his presidential campaign.
Yet taxing at least the most generous employer-provided plans above a threshold amount would meet two elusive goals for Mr. Obama: It would raise a lot of money and, economists say, cut overall health spending by making consumers more cost-conscious.
Administration officials recently began promoting a fallback. Rather than tax individuals, it would single out insurance companies that sell "Cadillac" plans. David Axelrod, a White House strategist, has described the proposal in populist terms, saying it would hit "the $40,000 policies that the head of Goldman Sachs has" and "not impact on the middle class."
That position, analysts predict, cannot hold over time.
"There is no way we can pay for health care and the rest of the Obama agenda, plus get our long-term deficits under control, simply by raising taxes on the wealthy," said Isabel V. Sawhill, a former Clinton administration budget official. "The middle class is going to have to contribute as well."

Full text: A rally that has carried major stock indexes 10 percent higher in the last two weeks leveled off on Monday, as investors took a moment to survey some mixed reports on corporate profits.
Markets were tugged in two directions by a surprising increase in sales of new homes, and by weaker earnings reports from the health insurance, telecommunications and retail sectors. Shares spent much of the day wobbling between positive and negative territory before finishing slightly higher.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 15.27 points, or 0.2 percent, to 9,108.51. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 2.92 points, or 0.3 percent, at 982.18. The technology-focused Nasdaq was 0.1 percent or 1.93 points higher, at 1,967.89.
Financial companies like Bank of America led the gains while shares of utilities and technology businesses pulled the markets down.
Treasury prices fell, pushing yields higher, as the government began to auction off a record $115 billion in notes. The yield on the benchmark 10-year note rose to 3.72 percent, its highest levels since late last month, and up from 3.66 percent on Friday. The price fell 16/32 to 95 4/32.
Although corporate earnings are down more than 20 percent from last year, they are still coming in much better than the 35 percent decline that many market watchers had expected. Of the 202 companies that have reported earnings, 77 percent have beaten expectations, according to data compiled by Thomson Reuters.
"Not only are more companies beating, but they're beating by a lot more," said Art Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Company. "It's been a relatively low bar to beat, and the market's reacted pretty positively to that."
But on Monday, shares of the health insurance company Aetna fell 2.7 percent after it reported a 28 percent decline in profit and reduced its outlook.
Verizon Communications reported a 7 percent drop in profit, yet its results met Wall Street expectations. Verizon said, however, that it planned to cut another 8,000 jobs, and its shares fell 1.6 percent to $31.
Although earnings reports from financial giants like Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase commanded much of the attention on Wall Street recently, some focus is shifting back to economic indicators this week.
A closely watched gauge of housing prices is being released Tuesday, and the government will detail the overall rate of economic growth when it reports the advance gross domestic product for the second quarter on Friday.
The economy declined at a pace of 5.5 percent in the first three months of 2009, but economists expect that the rate of contraction shrank to 1.5 percent in the second quarter.
Shares of major home builders rose on Monday after the Commerce Department reported that sales of new homes rose 11 percent in June to a seasonally adjusted rate of 384,000, a sharper increase than the 3 percent rise economists had expected. Sale prices fell for another month, to a nationwide median of $206,200, the government reported.
Economists said the figures offered more evidence that housing was bottoming out. This month, the government reported that housing starts had bounced higher in June, and the National Association of Realtors said sales of used homes increased for a third month.
The London interbank offered rate, a measure of borrowing costs, fell below 0.5 percent on Monday in another sign that credit markets were responding to huge government interventions. The three-month Libor rose to 4.8 percent last fall as credit locked up, but has dropped to record lows as lending conditions improved.
"They're still challenging, but they've eased substantially since the worst parts of the cycle," said Tobias Levkovich, chief United States equity strategist at Citigroup.
In Europe, the major markets closed slightly higher. The DJ Euro Stoxx-50 index, a barometer of euro-zone blue chips, rose 0.72 percent, giving the index a gain for the year of 6.28 percent. The CAC-40 in Paris rose 0.18 percent, and the DAX in Frankfurt was up 0.42 percent. The FTSE-100 index in London rose 0.21 percent.
Following are the results of Monday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills, and 20-year inflation notes:

Full text: Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, is on a publicity campaign with a message: the central bank is here to help, and it is not as mysterious or menacing as people might think.
In a profound departure from the central bank's tradition as an aloof and secretive temple of economic policy, Mr. Bernanke has plunged into the public spotlight to an extent that none of his predecessors would have contemplated.
He has given a television interview to "60 Minutes" on CBS, including a tour of his hometown, Dillon, S.C.; held what amounted to a televised news conference; and written newspaper commentaries to explain the Fed's efforts to fight the financial crisis.
On Sunday, Mr. Bernanke reached another milestone in his evolution from Fed chairman to Fed showman, participating in a one-hour town hall-style forum here organized and moderated by Jim Lehrer of "The NewsHour" on PBS.
Like a political candidate on the campaign trail -- indeed, his four-year term expires in January -- Mr. Bernanke fielded questions from local residents and tried to rebuff charges that the Fed was either conspiring with big banks, stifling free-market capitalism or possibly doing both at the same time.
When a small-business owner asked Mr. Bernanke why the Fed helped rescue big banks while "short-changing" small companies, Mr. Bernanke answered that he had decided to "hold my nose" because he was afraid the entire financial system would collapse.
"I'm as disgusted by it as you are," he told the audience of 190 people. "Nothing made me more angry than having to intervene, particularly in a few cases where companies took wild bets."
It was a far cry from what any other Fed chairman has been willing to do, but it was just the latest example of Mr. Bernanke's attempt to communicate directly with the public. Last week alone, Mr. Bernanke published a lengthy commentary in The Wall Street Journal, then testified before three separate Congressional committees and presided over a public Fed meeting to announce new regulations of credit card practices.
Of course, the Fed had already become more open in the decade before Mr. Bernanke took the reins, and his predecessor, Alan Greenspan, achieved rock-star fame during his long tenure as chairman. But Fed officials still cloaked themselves with a mantle of technocratic detachment from both partisan politics and day-to-day business life. They almost never spoke in public outside the controlled confines of scheduled speeches or Congressional hearings.
Fed policy makers make their decisions about interest rates behind closed doors, then communicate those decisions primarily through brief, cryptic statements that analysts busily decode in the days that follow.
But that kind of distance has become impossible in the two years since the American economy plunged into its worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. These days, Mr. Bernanke and the Fed have been bailing out financial institutions, printing money in unheard-of volumes and stepping in to fill the lending gap left by the crippled capital markets.
Even in better economic times, Mr. Bernanke, who was appointed by President George W. Bush in 2006, would be under pressure to get out the Fed's message: his term as Fed chairman ends at the end of next January, and President Obama will have to decide in the next few months whether to nominate him for another term or replace him with his own choice.
The Fed has never wielded as much power as it does right now, but the very expansion of its mission has exposed it to more second-guessing and more challenges to its political independence than ever before.
"The Federal Reserve, in collaboration with the giant banks, has created the greatest financial crisis the world has ever seen," Representative Ron Paul, Republican of Texas, said at a House hearing last week in which Mr. Bernanke testified about the state of the economy.
Republican lawmakers portray the Fed as the embodiment of heavy-handed big government, and have called for scaling back the central bank's regulatory powers. But liberal Democrats, like Representative Dennis J. Kucinich of Ohio, have accused the Federal Reserve of caving in to demands by banks for huge bailouts, for failing to protect consumers against dangerous financial products and for being too secretive about its emergency rescue programs.
More than 250 lawmakers have signed a bill sponsored by Mr. Paul that would allow the Government Accountability Office to "audit" the Fed's decisions on monetary policy -- a move that Fed officials see as a direct threat to their political independence in carrying out their central mission of setting interest rates.
Even those sympathetic to the herculean challenges confronting Mr. Bernanke acknowledge that the Fed has lost some of its aura of infallibility.
"When you have a terrible mess, it is unlikely that those who try to alleviate the danger of that mess will come out looking clean," said Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee.
The Fed chairman and the central bank are also caught in a political cross-fire over how to overhaul the nation's system of financial regulation.
President Obama has proposed a sweeping plan that would make the Fed more powerful in some respects and less powerful in others. Mr. Obama's plan would put the Fed in charge of regulating systemic risk, like the buildup of dangerous mortgages during the housing bubble, and would give the Fed power to impose tougher regulation over financial institutions deemed too big to fail.
At the same time, the administration plan would strip the Fed of its current authority to regulate mortgages and other forms of consumer lending, including credit cards. Those powers would be shifted to a new regulatory agency with broad power to regulate consumer financial products.
Mr. Bernanke strongly supports putting the Fed in charge of risk regulation, but he and Fed officials are resisting Mr. Obama's plan for a separate consumer regulatory agency. That puts him in the potentially awkward position of alienating the Fed's most important supporter -- the president.
At the town hall event, which will be shown on "The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer" this week in three parts, Mr. Bernanke set out to reassure people that the economy would regain its strength "within a few years." But he cautioned that the unemployment rate would probably climb above 10 percent before it gradually started to fall next year.
By the end of the session, he had fielded questions about home foreclosures, the risks of inflation and President Obama's proposals to overhaul the system of financial regulation.

Full text: LAST week Ben Bernanke appeared before Congress, setting off a discussion over whether the president should reappoint him as chairman of the Federal Reserve when his term ends next January. Mr. Bernanke deserves to be reappointed. Both the conventional and unconventional decisions made by this scholar of the Great Depression prevented the Great Recession of 2008-2009 from turning into the Great Depression 2.0.
Mr. Bernanke understands that in the Great Depression, the collapse of the money supply and the lack of monetary stimulus during contractions worsened the country's economic free fall. This lesson has paid off. Mr. Bernanke's decision to keep interest rates low and encourage lending has, for now, averted the L-shaped near depression that seemed highly likely after the financial collapse last fall.
To be sure, an endorsement of Mr. Bernanke's reappointment comes with many caveats. Mr. Bernanke, a Fed governor in the early part of this decade, supported flawed policies when Alan Greenspan pushed the federal funds rate (the policy rate set by the Fed as its main tool of monetary policy) too low for too long and failed to monitor mortgage lending properly, thus creating the housing and credit and mortgage bubbles.
He and the Fed made three major mistakes when the subprime mortgage crisis began. First, he kept arguing that the housing recession would bottom out soon (it has not bottomed out even three years later). Second, he argued that the subprime problem was a contained problem when in reality it was a symptom of the biggest leverage and credit bubble in American history. Third, he argued that the collapse in the housing market would not lead to a recession, even though about one-third of jobs created in the latest economic recovery were directly or indirectly related to housing. Mr. Bernanke's analysis was mistaken in several other important ways. He argued that monetary policy should not be used to control asset bubbles. He attributed the large United States current account deficits to a savings glut in China and emerging markets, understating the role that excessive fiscal deficits and debt accumulation by American households and the financial system played.
Still, when a liquidity and credit crunch emerged in the summer of 2007, Mr. Bernanke engineered a U-turn in Fed policy that prevented the crisis from turning into a near depression. He did this largely with actions and programs that were not in the traditional toolbox of monetary policy. The federal funds rate was effectively pushed down to zero to reduce borrowing costs and prevent the collapse of consumer demand and capital spending by business. New programs encouraged skittish institutions to resume lending. For the first time since the Great Depression, the Fed's role as lender of last resort was extended to investment banks.
Mr. Bernanke also introduced a wide range of other programs, like those to maintain the functioning of the commercial paper market (which makes short-term loans to companies so they can cover operating expenses like payrolls). The Fed was involved directly in the rescue of financial institutions like Bear Stearns and American International Group. It lent money to foreign central banks to ease a global shortage of dollars. The Fed even committed to purchasing up to $1.7 trillion of Treasury bonds, mortgage-backed securities and agency debt to reduce market rates. These are all radical actions that had almost never been undertaken before.
Some of these moves have raised important questions: Did the Fed help bail out institutions that should have been allowed to fail? Did it cause moral hazard as reckless lenders and investors were effectively bailed out? How and when will the Fed mop up the excess liquidity that its actions have created? Will these actions eventually cause inflation and a sharp fall of the value of the dollar? Has the Fed lost its independence as it has accommodated the fiscal needs of the government by bailing out banks and printing money to cover large fiscal deficits?
Still, the basic point remains: The Fed's creative and aggressive actions have significantly reduced the risks of a near depression. For this reason alone Mr. Bernanke deserves to be reappointed so that he can manage the Fed's exit from its most radical economic intervention since its creation in 1913.

Full text: An estimated 2.8 million employees will get a raise on Friday, as the federal minimum wage rises from $6.55 an hour to $7.25. Another 1.6 million whose hourly pay hovers around $7.25 are also expected to get a boost as employers adjust their pay scales to the new minimum. The raise is badly needed. It is also wholly inadequate.
With the latest increase, the minimum wage is still no higher now, after inflation, than it was in the early 1980s, and it is 17 percent lower than its peak in 1968. That means that no matter how hard they work, many low-wage workers keep falling behind. The latest increase will slow the decline in living standards, but it doesn't reverse the overall downward pull.
Even that understates the broader dimensions of the problem.
The minimum wage also sets a floor by which other wages are set. Keeping it low keeps wages lower than they would be otherwise, especially for jobs that are just above the minimum-wage level. That's a big problem for American workers because low-wage fields are the ones that are adding the most jobs.
According to the Labor Department, 5 of the 10 occupations expected to add the most jobs through 2016 are "very low paying," up to a maximum of about $22,000 a year. They include retail sales jobs and home health aides. Another 3 of the 10 are "low paying," from roughly $22,000 to $31,000, including customer-service representatives, general office clerks and nurses' aides.
During the presidential campaign, Barack Obama proposed lifting the minimum wage to $9.50 an hour by 2011 and, from there, adjusting it annually for inflation. He should press that goal. At $9.50 an hour, the minimum wage would be restored to its historical highs -- about 50 percent of the average wage. And it would restore the minimum wage to its broader function -- helping boost pay across the economy.
President Obama talks a lot about a bright future with high-paying green technology jobs. It is imperative to plan and work for that future. But a concerted effort must also be made to improve the opportunities for workers in the types of low-wage jobs that are going to be most plentiful for years to come.
That means working with unions, professional associations, community colleges and employers to build so-called career ladders so workers can attain the skills they need to advance, say, from a very-low-paid home care aide, to a low-paid nurse's aide, to a higher-paid licensed vocational nurse. Partnerships between unions and employers in hospitals, casinos and factories have pioneered such skill-building efforts, combining on-the-job training with classroom instruction.
The Labor Department must also ensure that low-paid workers are not exploited by vigorously enforcing workplace safety rules and fair pay practices.
Low-paid jobs are a fact of working life in America. Unlike so many of the nation's higher-paying jobs, they are not going away. One of the big challenges of our time is to ensure that for some workers, they are a stepping stone to better jobs and that for all workers, they are safe and fairly compensated.

Full text: Forget the wonkery. Let's get primeval. Rising health care costs are a stampede of big ugly rhinos. They are trampling your crops, stomping on your children's play areas and spoiling your hunting grounds.
President Obama wasn't exaggerating when he said this cost onslaught is unsustainable. The rhinos have been roaming unchecked for a generation. We've thrown research projects, legislative and corporate reforms at them, all in an effort to tamp down health care inflation. But the rhinos keep coming. They are ubiquitous, powerful, protean and inexorable.
They feed on fuel sources deep in our system: expensive technological progress, the self-interest of the millions of people who make their living off the system, the public's desire to get the best care for nothing, the fee-for-service payment system and so on.
The rhinos are closing off your future. As the White House folks say, health care premiums have doubled over the last decade. The government is saddled with $36 trillion in unfunded liabilities.
So your only question should be: Where do you find a tool or weapon big enough to stop the rhino stampedes? You know the problem is big, and you figure the response had better be gigantic.
Then you look on Capitol Hill and you see a bunch of popguns. The politicians describe these big ugly problems, but when it comes time to talk about their remedies they tell you: Don't worry. Nothing's going to change. In other words, we're going to eliminate the biggest, hairiest, most entrenched problem in the country without fundamentally changing the system and without asking for sacrifice from anybody.
Good luck.
Then you talk to the health care experts promoting the bills and they are very honest: We don't know exactly how to slow health care inflation. But we think we have some good ideas. We're going to put some innovations, information clearinghouses and pilot projects in this legislation, and over the next 10 years we will see what works to really bring down costs. We're going to go on a voyage of discovery to learn about rhino eradication.
And, indeed, some of the ideas do sound good: more information technology, comparative effectiveness research, conducting experiments to bundle hospital payments so they are based on outcomes. Some of the providers that do things right, like the Mayo Clinic, really are getting results.
But some of these ideas have been watered down in the legislation. And you're not a complete idiot. You know there is a big difference between finding islands of excellence and creating a national system based on them.
Besides, you've got a bunch of big, evil rhinos stomping around! You want more than some promising ideas to pinpoint waste, fraud and abuse. You want some big heavy hammers to clock those suckers in the head.
Now that the first wave of legislation is bogging down, you want to take the seeds of cost control and you want to do more. You want to eliminate or cap the tax exemption on employee health benefits. This is a big way to crush one of the core drivers of health care inflation. You're willing to give MedPAC-style technocrats a chance to take control of Medicare spending away from Congressional spendthrifts.
You want to loosen federal regulations so that states have more room to experiment -- not tighten them, as the current legislation does, so that states have less. You want reforms throughout the system that will cut down on first-dollar reimbursement in exchange for catastrophic protection. You want to tie Medicare subsidies to income. You want to look at anything that will move us away from a fee-for-service model, the core perversion in the system.
You want to change incentives at both ends. The legislators who drew up the first bills want to change the provider's incentives. But big cost savings can also come if consumers have choices and incentives to hunt for cheaper coverage. The Wyden-Bennett bill gives people a chance to choose the best option, instead of imprisoning people in existing coverage, as the current legislation does. The Medicare Part D reform has produced impressive reductions by allowing consumers to pocket prescription drug savings. Other proposals would give people tax credits and allow them to go to any trusted community group -- like AARP or a union or a religious group -- that wanted to compete to offer coverage.
Not everything is compatible with everything else. But the point is that you have rhinos at the door! You'll try anything that works. You want a political class that no longer perpetuates the myth that people can get everything for nothing. You know that it was political pandering that got us into this mess in the first place.
Obama is right. Things will be bad if we don't tackle the problem this year. Things will be worse if we add to the costs without beating the rhinos.

Full text: Although it may be hard to remember now, there was a time when the National Endowment for the Arts seemed to be on solid footing, both financially and politically, and could spend its days quietly financing artists and arts groups at its discretion.
Then came the controversies -- Robert Mapplethorpe's homoerotic photographs, Karen Finley's chocolate-smeared performance pieces, Andres Serrano's urine-immersed crucifix and others -- and from the late 1980s onward, the endowment seemed to be constantly under siege.
After the Republican sweep of Congress in 1994, it was only a matter of time -- just about a year -- before the N.E.A.'s overall budget was cut by 40 percent, to $99.5 million for 1996, from $162.3 million, and its ability to finance potentially divisive artists (with the exception of some literary writers) was eliminated. For a while there, it seemed as if the agency might not survive.
But it did, thanks partly to the efforts of successive leaders, partly to the gradual fading of the culture wars from public consciousness. And now, as the N.E.A.'s chairman-designate, Rocco Landesman, awaits his confirmation (his proposed nomination is expected to be approved before the Congressional recess in August), he looks likely to start the job on firmer ground than any of his recent predecessors.
In June a House subcommittee approved a $170 million budget for the endowment for next year, an increase of $15 million from the current budget and $9 million more than President Obama, widely considered an avid arts supporter, had requested. (The president, however, did supplement this year's budget with $50 million in stimulus money, which the N.E.A. has been distributing to state arts agencies and local organizations.)
Certainly the economy, and the growing public anxiety about the deficit, may yet put a damper on arts financing. But political goodwill toward the endowment is clearly on the rise, and many in the arts world are wondering if Mr. Landesman will be able to lead it, finally, into a new era -- and, if he does, in what direction he will take it.
Mr. Landesman isn't talking, pending his confirmation. Still, as a Broadway producer, he has a reputation for being direct, irreverent and occasionally confrontational, which has led many people to expect a shake-up of the endowment and a more aggressive management style.
Bill Ivey and Dana Gioia, the endowment chairmen who served through most of the years after the deep cutbacks of 1996, worked hard to make the most of the depleted agency they inherited, spending much of their time and energy trying to rebuild the N.E.A.'s prestige and credibility with Congress. Even if Mr. Landesman hopes to strike out on a new path, say, by pushing to restore grants to individual artists -- something many people in the arts considered "the heart and soul of the endowment," as the painter Chuck Close put it in an interview -- he may find himself looking to the tenures of Mr. Gioia and Mr. Ivey.
As interviews with the former chairmen and others familiar with the endowment show, along with an analysis of N.E.A. grant patterns, the two men often found creative, if not always universally admired, ways to push their agendas forward in the face of institutional constraints.
In some cases they did this by identifying and honing in on areas of potential spending that were less likely to raise Congressional hackles. During Mr. Ivey's tenure, from 1998 to 2001, for instance, spending on design grants increased by more than 130 percent, even if the chairman -- an academic whom President Bill Clinton hired away from the directorship of the Country Music Foundation in Nashville -- was not himself a design hound.
"I'm a folklorist and came into the chairmanship with an interest in the folk arts, but, while folk arts funding was certainly maintained during my tenure, I did not feel free to indulge my enthusiasm by pumping up that part of the endowment's work," Mr. Ivey said. "We were still playing defense under the gaze of a critical and watchful Republican Congress, so we were very careful with both the reality and appearance of how money was spent."
And in 2003 the first of Mr. Gioia's six years as chairman, spending on arts-education grants increased by 49 percent. Although there were reductions in later years, that increase helped arts education dominate grants financing from 2003 to 2005. (Only N.E.A. "partnerships," through which state arts agencies and regional arts organizations distribute funds, received more money; these arrangements typically account for about 40 percent of the money the endowment awards.)
The United States has "dismantled the arts-education programs that used to be part of every public school," Mr. Gioia said. "The N.E.A. is uniquely positioned to provide leadership in this."
For Mr. Gioia, arts education was central to his vision for redeeming the endowment.
"Part of our mission as a public agency was to address the public," he said, adding that he saw changing perceptions of the agency -- through public outreach and his frequent meetings with members of Congress -- as an important part of his mandate as chairman.
Mr. Gioia is proud, he said, of having "defined the N.E.A. as an agency which brought the best of art and arts education to all Americans."
In much the same spirit, Mr. Gioia also established crowd-pleasing programs, like the Big Read, through which people read and discuss a single book in their communities; Operation Homecoming, in which active-duty troops and veterans write about their wartime experiences; and Shakespeare in American Communities, which sends traveling professional Shakespeare productions around the country and bills itself as "the largest tour of Shakespeare in American history."
Some arts professionals argue that these programs -- known as National Initiatives -- have absorbed too great a proportion of endowment funds. The Big Read, for example, cost about $9 million over the last two years.
"There were definitely concerns that by building special initiatives of that size, you were limiting the agency's ability to do the routine work of supporting other organizations," Mr. Ivey said, adding that the Big Read seemed to him more like "a humanities project and less like an art project."
Robert L. Lynch, president of Americans for the Arts, a lobbying group, said Mr. Gioia's effort to create a better image for the agency through these initiatives was "a good thing but not necessarily a long-term strategy."
"The emphasis needs to be using the leverage power of a tiny amount of money so that more things get funded in more places by people themselves," Mr. Lynch added, articulating a widely held view of how N.E.A. financing works best. The fiscal impact of the endowment's small budget has always been magnified by its outsize cultural influence, the thinking goes; the stamp of approval conferred by even a paltry N.E.A. grant can provide an arts organization with a powerful fund-raising tool.
"Much of what I did was try to explain to the country why they needed artists," Mr. Gioia said, pointing out that for fiscal year 2008 he secured the largest increase for the endowment's overall budget -- $20.1 million, raising the budget to nearly $145 million -- in 28 years. "That would not have happened had Congress not been convinced of the agency's ability to spend the money productively," he said.
The question that probably most preoccupies people in the arts is whether Mr. Landesman will succeed in securing more money for the endowment -- its budget still pales in comparison with those of other federal agencies -- and if he will try to restore the N.E.A.'s ability to make grants to individual artists. Although he declined to comment on his plans for the agency, Politico.com reported this month that Mr. Landesman had expressed an interest in reinstating those grants.
Representative Norman D. Dicks, Democrat of Washington, the chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on the Interior, which oversees the N.E.A., said he was open to discussing it. "We're willing to entertain that idea," he said in a telephone interview. "There is some risk here, and that's what we want to evaluate."
Some say that it is unlikely that the grants will be revived, because they require the N.E.A. to approve art before knowing its content. "I don't know if we're at a point where the political process can withstand the vicissitudes of contemporary art," Mr. Ivey said. "It does expose the agency more than any other single activity."
On the other hand, he continued, "I think it's much closer to being brought back" -- and he said he believes it should be. The grants would represent "a kind of signature investment by the federal government in the vitality of the nation's cultural life," Mr. Ivey said. "The American people should have the nerve to invest in the work of individual artists."
At the very least, cultural professionals say they are hopeful about a growing potential for art to be taken seriously as part of the national identity, rather than disparaged as an elitist, effete enterprise unworthy of federal support. "I hope that time is over, the period when artist have been held as suspicious by the politicians," said Michael Conforti, president of the Association of Art Museum Directors.
"Anybody interested in the arts has to be so thankful that, whatever did or didn't happen, the N.E.A. didn't go away," he added. "If it had gone away, it would be very difficult to reconstitute."

Abstract: On the subject of health care reform, most Americans probably don't have a good answer to the question. [...] that, obviously, is a problem for the White House and for Democratic leaders in Congress. [...] no one has grabbed the mantle as the defender of the typical household -- the opponent of spending that creates profits for drug companies and hospitals at no benefit to people's health and at significant cost to their finances.

Full text: What's in it for me?
On the subject of health care reform, most Americans probably don't have a good answer to the question. And that, obviously, is a problem for the White House and for Democratic leaders in Congress.
Current bills would expand the number of insured -- but 90 percent of voters already have insurance. Congressional leaders say the bills would cut costs. But experts are dubious. Instead, they point out that covering the uninsured would cost billions.
So the typical person watching from afar is left to wonder: What will this project mean for me, besides possibly higher taxes?
Barack Obama was able to rise from the Illinois State Senate to the presidency in large measure because of his ability to explain complex issues and then to make a persuasive argument. He now has a challenge worthy of his skills.
Our health care system is engineered, deliberately or not, to resist change. The people who pay for it -- you and I -- often don't realize that they're paying for it. Money comes out of our paychecks, in withheld taxes and insurance premiums, before we ever see it. It then flows to doctors, hospitals and drug makers without our realizing that it was our money to begin with.
The doctors, hospitals and drug makers use the money to treat us, and we of course do see those treatments. If anything, we want more of them. They are supposed to make us healthy, and they appear to be free. What's not to like?
The immediate task facing Mr. Obama -- in his news conference on Wednesday night and beyond -- is to explain that the health care system doesn't really work the way it seems to. He won't be able to put it in such blunt terms. But he will need to explain how a typical household, one that has insurance and thinks it always will, is being harmed.
The United States now devotes one-sixth of its economy to medicine. Divvy that up, and health care will cost the typical household roughly $15,000 this year, including the often-invisible contributions by employers. That is almost twice as much as two decades ago (adjusting for inflation). It's about $6,500 more than in other rich countries, on average.
We may not be aware of this stealth $6,500 health care tax, but if you take a moment to think, it makes sense. Over the last 20 years, health costs have soared, and incomes have grown painfully slowly. The two trends are directly connected: employers had to spend more money on benefits, leaving less for raises.
In exchange for the $6,500 tax, we receive many things. We get cutting-edge research and heroic surgeries. But we also get fabulous amounts of waste -- bureaucratic and medical.
One thing we don't get is better health than other rich countries, whether it's Canada, France, Japan or many others. In some categories, like emergency room care, this country seems to do better. In others, like chronic-disease care, it seems to do worse. "The fact that we spend all this money and don't have better outcomes than other countries is a sign of how poorly we're doing," says Dr. Alan Garber of Stanford University. "We should be doing way better."
So far, no one has grabbed the mantle as the defender of the typical household -- the opponent of spending that creates profits for drug companies and hospitals at no benefit to people's health and at significant cost to their finances.
Republicans have actually come out against doing research into which procedures improve health. Blue Dog Democrats oppose wasteful spending but until recently have not been specific. Liberals rely on the wishful idea -- yet to be supported by evidence -- that more preventive care will reduce spending. The American Medical Association, not surprisingly, endorses this notion of doing more care in the name of less care.
Mr. Obama says many of the right things. Yet the White House has not yet shown that it's willing to fight the necessary fights. Remember: the $6,500 tax benefits someone. And that someone has a lobbyist. The lobbyist even has an argument about how he is acting in your interest.
These lobbyists, who include big names like Dick Armey and Richard Gephardt, have succeeded in persuading Congress to write bills with a rather clever feature. They include some of the ideas that would cut costs -- but defang them.
One proposal would pay doctors based on the quality of care, rather than quantity, but it's a pilot project. Doctors who already provide good care may well opt in; doctors providing wasteful but lucrative care surely will not. The bills would also finance research on which treatments are effective. But Medicare officials would not be prevented from continuing to spend taxpayer money on ineffective treatments.
In reaction, some people who should be natural supporters of reform have become critics. The Mayo Clinic -- one of Mr. Obama's favorite models of care -- says the legislation fails to "help create higher-quality, more affordable health care."
On Thursday, Mr. Obama will visit another example he likes to cite, the Cleveland Clinic. Its successes capture what real reform would look like. Like Mayo, the Cleveland Clinic pays its doctors a salary, rather than piecemeal, and delivers excellent results for relatively little money.
"I came here 30-some years ago," Delos Cosgrove, a heart surgeon who is the clinic's chief executive, told me. "And I have never received any additional pay for anything I did. It never made a difference if I did five heart operations or four -- I got paid the same amount of money. So I had no incentive to do any extra tests or anything."
This is the crux of the issue, economists say: the current fee-for-service system needs to be remade. The administration has made some progress, by proposing a powerful new Medicare overseer who could force the program to pay for good results and stop paying for bad ones.
But even a strong Medicare plan won't be enough. Reform will need to attack the piecemeal system in numerous ways. Among the most promising, which Mr. Obama has resisted, is a limit on tax subsidies for the costliest health insurance plans. This limit would give households and employers a reason to become smarter shoppers.
Above all, reform can't revolve around politely asking the rest of the medical system to become more like the Cleveland Clinic.
In recent weeks, polls have shown that a solid majority of Americans support the stated goals of health reform. Most want the uninsured to be covered and want the option of a government-run insurance plan. Yet the polls also show that people are worried about the package emerging from Congress.
Maybe they have a point.

Full text: Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, is showing us the door. In Congressional testimony on Tuesday he detailed the central bank's plans for taking excess liquidity out of the economy once a recovery begins. His stratagems make sense but will require expert timing.
The new emphasis on exit strategies is encouraging -- it shows that the Fed is acknowledging the potential inflationary risk from its huge liquidity infusions.
And as Mr. Bernanke rightly notes, some of the Fed's emergency lending facilities will wind down naturally as the economy recovers, since they have onerous pricing and terms. Its loans outstanding have dropped from $1.5 trillion in January to less than $600 billion now.
Another trick will be to unwind the Fed's moves to increase the money supply through what is known as quantitative easing. A big component of this involved buying securities from banks and crediting the proceeds to their reserve accounts held at the Fed, essentially creating money without actually printing it.
The reserves were meant to back loans, but instead they've piled up. These excess reserves recently topped $800 billion, up from only a couple of billion before the crisis. And when banks regain their appetite for lending, putting these reserves to work would expand the real money supply, which in turn could spark inflation.
To avoid this, Mr. Bernanke says the Fed can use its relatively new authority to pay interest on banks' reserves. Increasing the rate from the current 0.25 percent would make it more attractive for banks to keep reserves on deposit, giving the Fed time to drain these funds by selling securities back to the banks.
But if loan floodgates open faster than expected, the Fed would be faced with the unpleasant prospect of having to crank rates up quickly. That would require lockstep increases in the central bank's benchmark Fed funds target rate -- perhaps to levels that might threaten any nascent economic recovery.
Given banks' continuing risk aversion, the Fed will probably have the luxury of tweaking rates rather than making market-jarring changes. And perhaps the central bank will prove able to finesse the balance between growth and inflation this time around. Unfortunately, it has a poor record of exiting gracefully.
The Case for Bonuses
Before the financial crunch, the battle between regulators and bankers used to be one-sided. Both agreed that bankers generally knew best. Bonuses, for example, were an internal matter. Postcrisis, however, regulators want more say.
Britain's Financial Services Authority, which is run by Hector Sants, has just laid down a line -- a tough one by its traditional standards -- on multiyear guaranteed bonuses. In a letter sent to more than 40 chief executives, it suggested such practices "may be inconsistent" with its pending approach to remuneration, which is based on keeping rewards aligned with risk.
Institutions based in Britain are not happy, especially with the idea that employment contracts signed as early as March, when the F.S.A. published its first consultation paper, could come under scrutiny. To them, the approach seems unfair and gets in the way of the high pay revival sweeping the industry. Even government-controlled banks, including Royal Bank of Scotland in Britain and Citigroup in the United States, are paying up for talent.
In theory, regulators could stop not only multiyear guarantees but also any reversion to old pay practices. The F.S.A. and its peers in the United States and elsewhere could decide that gargantuan pay packages were simply off the table. A few months ago, such a blanket decree, with a few exceptions, seemed plausible.
In practice, the mood has changed. The exceptions could now become the rule. When governments are turning a blind eye to the hiring practices of the banks under their control, regulators will have trouble being much tougher.
The F.S.A. may still try. Banks would be foolish to ignore its letter completely or protest too loudly. The regulator has the authority to levy fines or even to increase capital requirements for institutions it judges are careless about pay.
But wily bankers can probably protect their rewards without direct confrontations. Better to cut back on egregious contract terms, while marshalling persuasive arguments about how bankers and traders are getting extra pay for keeping a particularly close eye on the risks they are taking.

Seeing Perils Yet to Come, Fed Aims to Hold Down Rates

Abstract: In his testimony, Mr. Bernanke addressed growing concerns in Congress and on Wall Street that a burst of inflation might be the inevitable result of the Fed's decision to hold down rates indefinitely while pumping hundreds of billions of dollars into the economy to rescue banks and bolster the credit system. Financial markets, he argued in his testimony, would interpret a grant of review authority over monetary policy as a serious weakening of the Fed's independence and even an effort by Congress "to influence monetary policy decisions."

Full text: The economy is finally improving, but enough potholes lie ahead that the Federal Reserve needs to keep interest rates close to zero, at least until unemployment begins to come down, the Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, told Congress on Tuesday.
"On net, the past few months have seen some notable improvements," Mr. Bernanke said in his semiannual report to the House Financial Services Committee. The pace will pick up next year and accelerate in 2011, he said, but unemployment will remain high, damping down inflation for two more years.
"Job insecurity, together with home values and tight credit, is likely to limit gains in consumer spending," he said, noting that the unemployment rate has continued to rise steeply. If that were to continue, the current gradual recovery could "prove transient."
In his testimony, Mr. Bernanke addressed growing concerns in Congress and on Wall Street that a burst of inflation might be the inevitable result of the Fed's decision to hold down rates indefinitely while pumping hundreds of billions of dollars into the economy to rescue banks and bolster the credit system.
In his answers to committee members' questions and in an op-ed article that was published on Tuesday in The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Bernanke sought to allay that concern by outlining what he described as the Fed's tools for withdrawing liquidity when the time comes.
"He wanted to indicate that he does not have to execute that strategy yet," said Nigel Gault, chief domestic economist at IHS Global Insight. "He was telling the committee that the economy was too fragile for the Fed to do that."
The markets seemed to agree. Yields on Treasury securities, which rise when traders become concerned about inflation, fell after Mr. Bernanke's appearance.
The Fed chairman and the central bank's other policy makers argue that inflation is likely to fall, not rise. It will be "lower in 2009 than during 2008 as a whole," they said in the monetary policy report that they submit semiannually to Congress. That is "in part because of the sizable amount of slack in resource utilization."
The huge sums of money that the Fed has injected are potentially inflationary as a recovery takes hold. Slack utilization, however, is an offset. With millions of people unemployed or underemployed, and factories operating well below capacity, there is plenty of room, in theory at least, to step up output and avoid inflationary shortages as demand rises.
Mr. Bernanke also signaled that foreclosures on home mortgages might not have peaked, mainly because of the rising unemployment rate. In addition, he said, defaults are rising for commercial real estate, an unwinding that is beginning to require steps to shore up some lenders.
"It is a sector we are paying a lot of attention to," Mr. Bernanke said, adding that because commercial mortgages are a relatively small market, "I don't think we need to have an enormous program to stimulate improvement."
More broadly, the questions posed by the House committee members reflected a concern that the Fed has acquired too big a role in managing the economy -- a role born of the unprecedented measures that Mr. Bernanke took to address the credit crisis. Parrying these concerns, the Fed chairman argued that whatever steps Congress might take to audit or oversee the Fed's operations, or limit them, it should not interfere with the central bank's independence in setting interest rates and thus regulating economic activity.
One proposal before Congress would give the Government Accountability Office expanded authority to audit the Fed. That expanded authority did not include "G.A.O. reviews of some highly sensitive areas, notably monetary policy deliberations," Mr. Bernanke said, approvingly.
Financial markets, he argued in his testimony, would interpret a grant of review authority over monetary policy as a serious weakening of the Fed's independence and even an effort by Congress "to influence monetary policy decisions."
Several committee members, among them Representative Ron Paul, Republican of Texas, argued that the ballooning federal debt had to be reduced. The Fed chairman said that he agreed but that the reduction could not really begin until the economy was back on its feet.
"If the fiscal stimulus did not exist, unemployment would be higher," Mr. Bernanke said, and he suggested that the $787 billion now scheduled to be spent this year and next might not be enough.
Nevertheless, he said in his written testimony, "maintaining the confidence of the public and financial markets requires that policy makers begin planning now for the restoration of fiscal balance."
The committee members' questions, and Mr. Bernanke's testimony, dealt with the Fed's plans to withdraw the liquidity that has been injected into the system over the last year or more to keep credit flowing and huge banks from failing. The concern is that given the amounts involved, inflationary pressures will build up. Responding to that concern, Mr. Bernanke laid out the Fed's step-by-step plan in his op-ed article and to a lesser extent in his Congressional testimony.
One tool, for example -- authorized by Congress last fall -- gives the Fed power to raise interest rates on reserves that banks have on deposit at the Fed. If the rates are higher than what the banks can earn by lending their reserves to the public, Mr. Bernanke argued, then the banks will keep the money on deposit at the Fed rather than lend it to the private sector and in doing so encourage potentially inflationary spending.

Liberal Suicide March

Abstract: [...] there was the stimulus package. [...] there is health care.

Full text: It was interesting to watch the Republican Party lose touch with America. You had a party led by conservative Southerners who neither understood nor sympathized with moderates or representatives from swing districts.
They brought in pollsters to their party conferences to persuade their members that the country was fervently behind them. They were supported by their interest groups and cheered on by their activists and the partisan press. They spent federal money in an effort to buy support but ended up disgusting the country instead.
It's not that interesting to watch the Democrats lose touch with America. That's because the plotline is exactly the same. The party is led by insular liberals from big cities and the coasts, who neither understand nor sympathize with moderates. They have their own cherry-picking pollsters, their own media and activist cocoon, their own plans to lavishly spend borrowed money to buy votes.
This ideological overreach won't be any more successful than the last one. A Washington Post-ABC News poll released Monday confirms what other polls have found. Most Americans love Barack Obama personally, but support for Democratic policies is already sliding fast.
Approval of Obama's handling of health care, for example, has slid from 57 percent to 49 percent since April. Disapproval has risen from 29 percent to 44 percent. As recently as June, voters earning more than $50,000 preferred Obama to the Republicans on health care by a 21-point margin. Now those voters are evenly split.
Most independents now disapprove of Obama's health care strategy. In March, only 32 percent of Americans thought Obama was an old-style, tax-and-spend liberal. Now 43 percent do.
We're only in the early stages of the liberal suicide march, but there already have been three phases. First, there was the stimulus package. You would have thought that a stimulus package would be designed to fight unemployment and stimulate the economy during a recession. But Congressional Democrats used it as a pretext to pay for $787 billion worth of pet programs with borrowed money. Only 11 percent of the money will be spent by the end of the fiscal year -- a triumph of ideology over pragmatism.
Then there is the budget. Instead of allaying moderate anxieties about the deficits, the budget is expected to increase the government debt by $11 trillion between 2009 and 2019.
Finally, there is health care. Every cliche Ann Coulter throws at the Democrats is gloriously fulfilled by the Democratic health care bills. The bills do almost nothing to control health care inflation. They are modeled on the Massachusetts health reform law that is currently coming apart at the seams precisely because it doesn't control costs. They do little to reward efficient providers and reform inefficient ones.
The House bill adds $239 billion to the federal deficit during the first 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office. It would pummel small businesses with an 8 percent payroll penalty. It would jack America's top tax rate above those in Italy and France. Top earners in New York and California would be giving more than 55 percent of earnings to one government entity or another.
Nancy Pelosi has lower approval ratings than Dick Cheney and far lower approval ratings than Sarah Palin. And yet Democrats have allowed her policy values to carry the day -- this in an era in which independents dominate the electoral landscape.
Who's going to stop this leftward surge? Months ago, it seemed as if Obama would lead a center-left coalition. Instead, he has deferred to the Old Bulls on Capitol Hill on issue after issue.
Machiavelli said a leader should be feared as well as loved. Obama is loved by the Democratic chairmen, but he is not feared. On health care, Obama has emphasized cost control. The chairmen flouted his priorities because they don't fear him. On cap and trade, Obama campaigned against giving away pollution offsets. The chairmen wrote their bill to do precisely that because they don't fear him. On taxes, Obama promised that top tax rates would not go above Clinton-era levels. The chairmen flouted that promise because they don't fear him.
Last week, the administration announced a proposal to take Medicare spending decisions away from Congress and lodge the power with technocrats in the executive branch. It's a good idea, and it might lead to real cost savings. But there's no reason to think that it will be incorporated into the final law. The chairmen will never surrender power to an administration they can override.
That leaves matters in the hands of the Blue Dog Democrats. These brave moderates are trying to restrain the fiscal explosion. But moderates inherently lack seniority (they are from swing districts). They are usually bought off by leadership at the end of the day.
And so here we are again. Every new majority overinterprets its mandate. We've been here before. We'll be here again.
