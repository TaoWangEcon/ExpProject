Full text: The federal minimum wage rose to $ 7.25 an hour 10 years ago. It hasn't budged since.
For Americans living in the 21 states where the federal minimum wage is binding, inflation means that the minimum wage has lost 16 percent of its purchasing power.
But elsewhere, many workers and employers are experiencing a minimum wage well above 2009 levels. That's because state capitols and, to an unprecedented degree, city halls have become far more active in setting their own minimum wages.
Twenty-nine states and the District of Columbia have state-level minimum hourly wages higher than the federal one. In Washington State and Massachusetts, for example, it's $ 12.
But the true sea change is in the surge of city and county governments setting minimums. New York City has a $ 15 minimum wage, while in SeaTac, Wash., it's $ 16.09.
Averaging across all of these federal, state and local minimum wage laws, the effective minimum wage in the United States -- the average minimum wage binding each hour of minimum wage work -- will be $ 11.80 an hour in 2019. Adjusted for inflation, this is probably the highest minimum wage in American history.
Growth in the Effective Minimum Has Taken Off in Recent Years
The effective minimum wage has not only outpaced inflation in recent years, but it has also grown faster than typical wages. We can see this from the Kaitz index, which compares the minimum wage with median overall wages.
To put the growth in perspective: It took the 19 years ending in 2013 for the Kaitz index to rise four percentage points. In the six years since 2013, it has risen 13 percentage points.
The Federal Minimum Affects Only a Small Share of Minimum Wage Workers
Minimum wage laws above the federal level used to be the exception. In 1998, there were about a million minimum-wage workers in states with a minimum higher than the federal level, and virtually none in localities with separate minimums. Two-thirds of minimum wage workers lived in areas where the federal minimum applied.
But today 89 percent of the nation's 6.8 million minimum-wage employees face a minimum that is higher than $ 7.25 an hour. Even five years ago, relatively few such workers lived in areas with separate local minimum wages.
One consequence is increasing regional variation. American minimum wages now range from New York State's effective $ 13.73, which is 62 percent of the state's median overall wage, down to New Hampshire's $ 7.25 federal peg, which is just 30 percent of the state median.
Higher Minimum Wages Have Boosted Wage Growth at the Bottom ...
The most important question, though, is how the extraordinary rise in the effective minimum wage has affected American workers.
First, the good news: The average wage in the bottom third of the wage distribution -- minimum-wage workers and others -- has risen an average of 2.3 percent annually over the last three years after adjusting for inflation. The growth pressure from the wages of workers at or just around the minimum wage can account for between a quarter to a third of this growth.
Clearly state and local minimum-wage increases make a difference for workers who live and can find jobs in the places affected by them, even if this is not a complete explanation for the recent wage growth at the bottom nationally.
... But Like All Public Policies, Minimum Wage Increases Have Trade-Offs
Traditional textbook economics tells us that employers will cut jobs or hours for low-wage work if they're required to set the price of labor above the level consistent with market supply and demand. Therein lies one of the most contentious debates in economics right now.
In the real world, it's difficult to test this because of so many confounding factors.
For example, teenage employment rose about as much between 2013 and 2018 in states whose effective minimum wage didn't change as it did in states where it rose an average of 4 percent or greater each year.
The places that chose to raise their minimum wages may be different in important respects, both socioeconomic and demographic, from those that did not, like education; industry and occupation; and labor market health.
A sizable body of empirical research that adjusts for these issues concludes that while some workers are winners from minimum wage increases, many others lose out, particularly vulnerable workers like the young and those with less education. This calls into question whether raising the minimum wage is really the best way to help workers.
But beginning with David Card and Alan Krueger's landmark 1994 study of New Jersey's minimum wage increase, a growing economics literature is reaching a different conclusion: that the jobs effects found in these other studies is overstated, and that the rising minimum wages in the United States have had more of a net benefit.
For example, a huge study released this month analyzed 138 different state-level minimum wage increases since 1979. The authors found largely no net negative employment effects, though they did find some in sectors exposed to international trade. And University of Washington economists revised an initial study of Seattle's recent minimum wage increase that had showed significant negative effects on earnings for some workers. The new study found that the downsides were more muted.
Economists have several ideas for why negative jobs effects might be lower than expected. Employers may be less sensitive to minimum-wage increases because of long-term declines in national business competition and labor bargaining power, and the rise in profit rates and monopsony (in which a single buyer dominates a market).
The tightness of today's labor market may also help explain why it's hard to see much effect from recent increases. Perhaps minimum wages really "bite" only when they exceed a certain level. Or maybe employers have been reacting to them in ways not easily captured by wage data, such as by cutting benefits.
The push for higher state and local minimum wages shows no sign of abating, so no doubt we'll learn even more in coming years about their trade-offs, or lack thereof.
______
Methodology: The effective minimum wage is the binding federal, state or local minimum wage weighted by the usual labor hours of minimum wage workers at nonfarm wage and salary jobs paid hourly. It includes all federal and state laws as well as 32 localities with separate ordinances whose geography we can identify in the Current Population Survey Outgoing Rotation Group. We exclude tipped occupations from this calculation using the definitions used by the Economic Policy Institute. We calculate median overall wages and average hourly earnings in the C.P.S. to be conceptually similar to average hourly earnings in the Current Employment Statistics survey. Inflation-adjusted series use the chained C.P.I.-U deflator, which is extended before 2000 using the deflator for personal consumption expenditures. This analysis uses data on local minimum wage ordinances from the U.C. Berkeley Center for Labor Research and Education as well as from Kavya Vaghul and Ben Zipperer.

Full text: To be trapped in the boarding area of a smallish airport in the upper Midwest is, as often as not, to be subjected to that bestial din of fricatives, gutturals, plosives and shrieks of hysterical alarm that constitutes political discussion on Fox News, pouring incessantly from those obnoxious pendulous ceiling televisions. And unless one fancies running the T.S.A.'s gantlet of gropers again, there's no escape. The experience is especially nasty if one's wait coincides with the prime-time shows hosted by those two almost indistinguishable fellows with the suety faces, bouffant coiffures and nerve-racking mezzo-castrato voices.
That fate, at least, I avoided a few weeks back. Instead, there I was with the commentator Ben Stein hovering over me like some grim heathen god, exuding all the effervescent charm of a despondent tree sloth, glumly wobbling his jowls and opining that Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez espouses a political philosophy that in the past led to the rise of Hitler and Stalin.
Now, I realize that this has become axiomatic on America's excitable right. I know also that in this country we employ terms like "socialism" with wanton indifference to historical details and conceptual distinctions. I grasp too that many among us truly believe that, say, a higher marginal tax rate or a public subsidy for poor children's dentistry is only a step away from the gulags. And I am painfully aware that the male Fox commentariat nurtures its sickly obsession with Ms. Ocasio-Cortez partly because they resent her cleverness, charisma and moral vitality, but mostly because they suspect that in high school she was one of those girls they had no hope of getting a date with (though, really, she comes across as someone who could look past a face of even the purest suet if she thought she glimpsed a healthy soul behind it).
Just then, however, I was emotionally unprepared for this particular assault on my intelligence. I cast a fond, forlorn glance back in the direction of those T.S.A. agents and their warm inviting paws.
Absurd as it was, though, Mr. Stein's remark was not all that far removed from mainstream American public opinion. Even the liberal "left" in this country is densely populated with politicians whose stated views on socialism seem scarcely more exact.
It may be amusing to hear Republicans assert that a military kleptocracy like Venezuela is a socialist country because its government uses that word when lying about itself (rather in the way that North Korea claims to be a people's democratic republic). It may make one wince to see Senator Bernie Sanders obliged (as he was on Monday at a town hall hosted by CNN) to explain once more that the totalitarian statism of the Soviet Union had nothing to do with the (far older) tradition of democratic socialist thought. But fair's fair, it's not much less bizarre to hear a "progressive" like JuliÃ¡n Castro, the former housing secretary, assert that "socialism" simply means state seizure of all the means of production. (Had Marx and Engels only known this, they might have spared themselves the effort of denouncing the socialists of their time for failing to call for a completely centralized economy.)
Well -- only in America, as they say. Only here is the word "socialism" freighted with so much perceived menace. I take this to be a symptom of our unique national genius for stupidity. In every other free society with a functioning market economy, socialism is an ordinary, rather general term for sane and compassionate governance of the public purse for the purpose of promoting general welfare and a more widespread share in national prosperity.
In countries where, since World War II, the principles of democratic socialism have shaped public policy (basically, everywhere in the developed world except here), the lives of the vast majority of citizens, most especially in regard to affordable health care, have improved enormously. This is acknowledged by almost every political faction, whether "liberal" (like Social Democrats), "conservative" (like Christian Democrats) or "progressive" (like Greens). And the preposterous cost projections that American conservative propagandists routinely adduce to prove that "socialized medicine" or a decent public option would exhaust our Treasury are given the lie in each of those countries every day.
Democratic socialism is, briefly put, a noble tradition of civic conscientiousness that was historically -- to a far greater degree than either its champions or detractors today often care to acknowledge -- grounded in deep Christian convictions. I, for instance, am a proud son of the European Christian socialist tradition, especially in its rich British variant, as exemplified by F.D. Maurice, John Ruskin, William Morris, R.H. Tawney and many other luminaries (including, in his judiciously remote way, C.S. Lewis), but also in its continental expressions (see, for example, Pope Pius IX's encyclical Quadragesimo Anno, with its prescient warnings against the dangers of unfettered capitalism).
True, I have lived abroad often enough to be conscious of the flaws in various nations' social democratic systems. But I know too that those systems usually make possible something closer to a just and charitable society than ours has ever been. I can also tell the difference between Venezuela and today's Germany, or the Scandinavian states, or France, or Britain, or Australia, or Canada (and so on).
One need not idealize any of these nations or ignore the ways in which they differ in balancing public and private financing of civic services. But all of them are, broadly speaking, places where -- without any unsustainable burden on the national economy -- the cost of health care per capita is far lower than it is here and yet coverage is universal, where life spans are longer, where working people are not made destitute by serious illnesses, where a choice between food or pharmaceuticals need never be made, where the poor cannot be denied treatments by insurance adjusters, where pre-existing health conditions could never be denied coverage, where most people have far more savings and much lower levels of debt than is the case here, where very few families live only a paycheck away from total poverty, where wages generally keep pace with inflation, where every worker has decent vacation time each year, where suicide and opioid addiction are not the default lifestyle of the working poor, where homelessness is exceedingly rare, where retirement care is humane and comprehensive and where the schools are immeasurably better than ours are.
Americans, however, recoil in horror from these intolerable impositions on personal liberty. Some of us are apparently even, like Mr. Stein, canny enough to see the shadow of the death camps falling across the whole sordid spectacle. We know that civic wealth is meant not for civic welfare, but should be diverted to the military-industrial complex by the purchase of needless weapons systems or squandered through obscene tax cuts for the richest of the investment class. We know that working families should indenture themselves for life to predatory lending agencies. We know that, when the child of a working family has cancer, the child should be denied the most expensive treatments, and then probably die, but not before his or her family has been utterly impoverished.
We call this, I believe, being free. And as long as we have access to all the military-grade guns we could ever need to fight off invasions from Venus, and to assure that our children will be slaughtered at regular intervals in their schools, what else can we reasonably ask for?

Full text: Reports of the economic expansion's death appear to have been greatly exaggerated.
The United States economy surged unexpectedly in the first quarter, the Commerce Department said Friday, allaying concern that financial-market volatility and a prolonged government shutdown would cause a slump.
That is good news for President Trump, who is counting on a strong economy to improve his chances for re-election. With investors and consumers alike showing renewed optimism, it is now all but certain that the decade-long expansion will become the longest on record later this year.
"The angst has settled, and the economy has come back," said Ben Herzon, an economist with Macroeconomic Advisers, a forecasting firm. "I just can't point to anything now that's going to push us into recession."
Gross domestic product, the broadest measure of goods and services produced in the economy, rose at a 3.2 percent annual rate in the first three months of the year. That is faster than most economists expected, and far better than the dour outlook of early this year, when many forecast that the figure could fall below 1 percent.
Friday's figures are preliminary and will be revised at least twice in the months ahead.
Economists warned that the report was inflated by short-term factors and probably overstated the underlying pace of growth. Most anticipate a downshift as the year progresses.
Still, after a rough winter, the economy appears to have entered the spring fundamentally intact. Mr. Trump heralded the report on Friday, declaring the first-quarter growth figure "an incredible number."
"We're number-one economy right now in the world and it's not even close," he told reporters on his way to an event in Indianapolis.
Mr. Trump has often treated G.D.P. -- along with the stock market, the trade deficit and other economic indicators -- as a sort of scorecard for his presidency. Late last year, that scorecard wasn't looking good, as growth slowed, the trade deficit ballooned and the stock market plunged.
Kevin Hassett, chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, acknowledged on Friday that there had been nervousness inside the White House that the partial federal government shutdown, which idled hundreds of thousands of federal workers and disrupted countless private businesses, could cause growth to stall in the first quarter. A sharp drop in consumer spending in December and a slowdown in job growth in February added to those fears.
Things have looked up since then, however. Consumer confidence rebounded quickly once the shutdown ended, and retail sales were strong in March. Hiring, too, has recovered. And the stock market has roared back, hitting record highs this week.
"Everything kind of turned around relatively quickly," Mr. Hassett said. "The government reopened. A lot of uncertainty resolved. Equity markets started to get more confident, and then I think a lot of other people did too."
Several factors explain the renewed optimism. Efforts by Chinese authorities to stabilize their slumping economy seem to be working, damping fears of a global economic slowdown. China and the United States also appear to be nearing a trade deal, reducing the risk of a new round of tariffs.
Perhaps the most important factor in the turnaround: the Federal Reserve. Markets began to stabilize, and stocks climbed again, after Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chairman, said in January that the central bank would be "patient" before raising interest rates again, after four increases in 2018.
Mr. Trump and his allies had been sharply critical of the Fed's rate hikes. The president has said he will nominate one such ally, Stephen Moore, to fill an opening at the Fed. On Friday, Mr. Moore, an informal economic adviser to Mr. Trump, said the new growth figure made him feel "100 percent" vindicated in his criticisms.
"Thank God the Fed listened to me," Mr. Moore said.
Mr. Powell has said the president's criticisms won't influence the bank's decisions. Still, Mr. Trump has gotten what he wanted: When Fed policymakers meet next week, it is essentially a foregone conclusion that they will leave interest rates unchanged.
Fed officials indicated in March that they did not expect to raise rates again this year, in part because they forecast a growth slowdown from last year, and still-tame inflation. Friday's report showed inflation slowing yet further in the first quarter.
Indeed, despite the robust G.D.P. figure, the underlying pace of economic growth has slowed since the middle of last year, when tax cuts and government spending briefly pushed the growth rate above 4 percent.
The most important components of the economy -- consumer spending and business investment -- were both weak in the first quarter, and the housing market contracted for the fifth quarter in a row. The strength in G.D.P. was partly the result of a surge in inventories and a drop in imports, both of which are likely to reverse in the second quarter.
For a better gauge of the economy's health, analysts recommend focusing on a different number, which strips out trade and inventory effects as well as the impact of government spending. That measure, known as final private sales, came in at 1.3 percent, down from 2.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the weakest showing since 2013.
"Domestic demand in the economy -- investment, consumer spending -- that was weak," said Ellen Zentner, chief United States economist for Morgan Stanley.
Economists expect consumer spending to bounce back in the second quarter, as December's market drop and January's shutdown fade into memory. But businesses remain cautious, in part because they expect the economy to cool gradually as the effects of last year's tax cuts and spending increases fade.
"If there's weakness, it's in the business-spending data," said Michael Gapen, chief United States economist for Barclays. "It has yet to rebound in a meaningful way following the end of the government shutdown."
Worthington Industries, an Ohio-based metals manufacturer, has seen no sign of a slowdown from its domestic customers, said Andy Rose, the company's president. Still, spending isn't rising as quickly as it did early in the recovery, and slower growth in China and other countries has hurt sales overseas, while Mr. Trump's steel tariffs have driven up costs.
"We're not seeing a drop-off, but I think the challenge for a lot of U.S. companies right now is to find where the next leg up is going to come from," Mr. Rose said. "How are we going to drive earnings growth going forward if we're not going to see a big increase in demand?"
That means companies are looking for other ways to improve profitability, including cutting costs.
"Cost cutting certainly is a late-cycle exercise," Mr. Rose said. "Labor costs are going up. You have no choice but to try to save costs where you can."
That caution may reflect nervousness about how long the economy's run of good fortune can last. The Great Recession officially ended in June 2009; in July, the expansion will officially become the longest on record.
Economists, however, say that expansions do not die of old age -- there has to be a cause. And while they expect growth to slow this year, they see few risks on the horizon that are large enough to tip the economy over the edge.
"We had a near miss on a recession, but we didn't have one last year," said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist for RSM, a financial consulting firm. "We won't have one this year. I think this is a good place for the economy to be."

Full text: XIJIAHE, China -- The plague's victims die gruesomely.
First, a high fever. The skin goes flushed, purplish. There is a discharge from the eyes and nose. Bloody diarrhea. And within days, death. The survival rate is near zero.
By China's official estimates, the present outbreak of African swine fever, which affects pigs but is harmless to humans, has already been catastrophic. More than a million pigs have been culled, according to the Chinese government. A billion-plus pork-loving people are facing much tighter supplies. The need to fill the gap is influencing meat markets worldwide.
But the reality of the epidemic may be grimmer still. Several farmers said in interviews that they had not reported potential infections among their animals to the local authorities. Others said officials had not responded quickly to reported outbreaks.
As a result, many farmers and livestock analysts say they assume that the highly contagious disease has infected more pigs, in more places, than Chinese officials have acknowledged.
When Ge Xiuxiu's pigs started dying this year, he did not tell the authorities. Mr. Ge, 48, doubts that the government can afford to keep its promise to compensate farmers like him who have been affected by the outbreak.
"Reporting it wouldn't have made a difference," he said, standing outside his farm in Xijiahe, a village in China's Shandong Province. "Who would have done anything about it? Whoever does anything has to pay up."
The need to get a grip on African swine fever could not be more urgent for China, the world's largest producer and consumer of pork. Yet the official response seems to fit a pattern from previous crises involving public health and safety in the country, including an AIDS epidemic in the 1990s, an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in the early 2000s and a widespread tainting of baby formula in 2008.
The authorities' tendency to hush up such problems engenders public distrust. Distrust makes the problems even harder to solve.
In the current crisis, the distrust is being felt not just by farmers and industry specialists, but by consumers as well. Some Chinese shoppers, skeptical of assurances that the disease does not harm human health, are starting to shun pork.
African swine fever, for which no treatment or vaccine exists, has spread to every Chinese province and region, and has also jumped the border into Cambodia, Mongolia and Vietnam. Analysts at the Dutch bank Rabobank, which lends heavily to the global agriculture industry, have predicted that China will produce 150 million to 200 million fewer pigs this year because of deaths from infection or culling. That would be a hefty chunk of the 700 million pigs slaughtered in China in 2018.
The Chinese economy, already slowing, is starting to feel the effects. Higher pork prices helped push inflation to a five-month high in March. The nation's stock of live pigs has fallen by a fifth from a year ago. The government, anticipating shortfalls, has bought frozen pork to build up its strategic reserve. Hog futures in the United States have rallied as traders bet that China will buy more American meat.
China has introduced new hygiene requirements, imposed quarantines and restricted the transporting of swine. But such measures will be of limited use if the authorities have an incomplete picture of the problem -- or if they have more a complete picture that they do not make public.
"There's no way to control something that you don't acknowledge exists," said Christine McCracken, a Rabobank analyst. In places where infections were not reported or acknowledged, farmers and pork producers might not be taking adequate safety precautions, she said. They may even be selling and processing infected animals. African swine fever can linger for weeks or months in uncooked and frozen pork.
"It only takes one infected piece of meat entering the chain to muck it all up again," Ms. McCracken said.
The government has threatened to punish farms that do not immediately report outbreaks. Across China, though, dead pigs have been found heaped in rivers and ditches, suggesting that farmers disposed of them without notifying the authorities.
In February, a farm owner in Hebei Province said on social media that the local government was not officially confirming a potential outbreak at his company. Fifteen thousand pigs had died, the owner, Sun Dawu, wrote.
The post, which included a photo of Mr. Sun's dead swine in a pile, circulated widely. Two days later, the Ministry of Agriculture confirmed the outbreak, Hebei's first.
From the central government to the local authorities, "which of them actually wanted me to report the outbreak?" Mr. Sun said in an interview. "Everybody is afraid of being held accountable."
Across China, the timing and pattern of confirmed cases suggest that infections are being declared in some places long after pigs fall sick, said Bi Jie, a livestock specialist in Tai'an, a city in Shandong Province.
The government announced China's first case of African swine fever last August, in the northeastern province of Liaoning. Within weeks, cases were being declared in provinces hundreds of miles south.
The disease is unlikely to have traveled so quickly, Mr. Bi said. It is more plausible that pigs had become infected in all of these places weeks before outbreaks were officially declared. "If you look at the situation that is being reported, there are things that can't be explained," he said.
The Ministry of Agriculture did not respond to a faxed request for comment.
Shandong, where Xijiahe sits, is China's second-most populous province and a major producer of pigs. Yet the national government has confirmed only one case of African swine fever in Shandong so far.
Earlier, Shandong-made pork products reportedly tested positive for the disease in Taiwan and the eastern city of Hangzhou. But the authorities did not declare infections in Shandong at the time.
Animal health inspection offices in Shandong's provincial capital, Jinan, are short on staff and funding, according to an internal report that was issued in January by Jinan administrators and reviewed by The New York Times.
"This makes it difficult to do what is needed to prevent and control African swine fever," the report said.
Recently, after reporters discovered piles of pigs rotting near villages in Shandong, a local official was asked on television whether he had been aware of illegal dumping. The TV host repeated her question eight times before the official, visibly uncomfortable, admitted that he had not.
In Hejiage, a village in Shandong, He Shuxia lost some pigs this year to what looked like the dreaded fever. Yet she said nothing to the authorities.
The animals died too quickly, Ms. He said. She was also afraid of further contaminating her farm by welcoming outsiders or going out herself.
In nearby Junan County, the disease control center of the Bureau of Animal Husbandry has not been contacted by a single farmer about possible cases of African swine fever, said Zhao Guihua, the center's deputy director.
Mr. Zhao said he had, however, received a call from a farmer whose pig chewed through a wire and electrocuted itself.
Asked why farmers might not have reported infected pigs, Mr. Zhao said the only reason he could imagine was that they did not have any.
Asked whether he found it strange that Shandong had reported only one case of African swine fever while neighboring provinces had reported more, he laughed.
"What's strange about that?" he said.
In a faxed statement, Shandong's Bureau of Animal Husbandry said the province had strengthened its systems and controls, "slowing and reducing the occurrence of the African swine fever epidemic in Shandong to the greatest possible extent." The statement said Shandong had strictly followed national rules about reporting and confirming outbreaks.
Financial pressures may be shaping local officials' response to the epidemic. China is promising around $ 180 for every pig a farmer culls from an infected herd. This cost is split between the national and local administrations. But the central government pays a bigger share in poorer provinces, which might give wealthier provinces like Shandong an incentive to avoid reporting suspected outbreaks to higher authorities. The national government ultimately decides which outbreaks to confirm.
Chinese officials have blamed poor hygiene at small farms for the disease's spread. In Shandong, however, the sole confirmed case of African swine fever was discovered at the Wangaofa Animal Husbandry Development Company, which has modern equipment. The facility is empty now, the ghostly hallways splattered white with disinfecting lime.
A nearby farmer, Gao Shouguang, was ordered to dispose of his pigs, even though they had not gotten sick.
Workers came to bury the animals in the middle of the night, Mr. Gao, 58, said. The stench was awful.
How deep China's pork shortfall becomes depends on how quickly farmers start raising pigs again.
In Hejiage, Ms. He said she was still too rattled to do so. Mr. Ge, in Xijiahe, said that he and his wife might try growing strawberries this year instead.
"We have nothing left," he said.

Full text: Jack Ma, the richest man in China and founder of the e-commerce company Alibaba, is a big fan of extreme overwork. He recently praised China's "996" practice, so called because it refers to those who put in 12-hour days -- 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. -- six days a week. This "is not a problem," he said in a recent blog post, instead calling it a "blessing."
The response from others in China was swift. "If all enterprises enforce a 996 schedule, no one will have children," one person argued on the same platform. "Did you ever think about the elderly at home who need care, the children who need company?" It even prompted a response from Chinese state media, which reminded everyone, "The mandatory enforcement of 996 overtime culture not only reflects the arrogance of business managers, but also is unfair and impractical."
Managers who think like Mr. Ma can be found the world over. Here at home, Elon Musk, a co-founder of Tesla, has argued that "nobody ever changed the world on 40 hours a week." Uber reportedly used to use the internal mantra "Work smarter, harder and longer." (It's now just "smarter" and "harder.") The company has also rebranded second jobs as clever "side hustles." WeWork decorates its co-working spaces with phrases like, "Don't stop when you're tired, stop when you are done." Other tech and business gurus try to sell us on "toil glamour."
The truth is that they're all wrong. Workers certainly suffer when forced to put in extreme hours. But business fares just as poorly. No one benefits from people pushing themselves to the brink of exhaustion.
One of the reasons Mr. Ma says he supports 996 culture is people who work longer get the "rewards of hard work." But they are apparently not in store for monetary rewards: A group of academics just released research finding that working longer hours than someone else in the same job doesn't earn you more money; instead it leads to a 1 percent decrease in wages. Another analysis similarly found that after 40 hours a week, there isn't a clear financial return to clocking more hours. Excessive work effort has even been linked, perversely, to worse career outcomes.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has also warned that putting in extra hours is associated with poorer health, including weight gain and higher alcohol and tobacco use, and increased injury, illness and even mortality. Health researchers have found that overwork is linked to a higher risk of heart disease and stroke.
Mr. Ma went so far in his post as to say that those who aren't willing to put in such long hours need not apply to work at Alibaba. He's only shooting himself in the foot.
There's a ceiling on how much more someone can get done by simply spending more time at work. After about 48 hours a week, a worker's output drops sharply, according to a Stanford economist. Other research has appeared to support this finding. While there may be an initial burst of activity from overworking, people who work more than 55 hours a week perform worse than those who go home at a normal hour and get some rest.
There are other costs to employers. An elder-care facility in Sweden that tried a six-hour workday reportedly found that nurses took fewer sick days and were more productive. Fatigued workers cost employers $100 billion in lost productivity.
This all became obvious to the American business community long ago. As strong unions pushed for a 40-hour workweek in the 1800s, business leaders who acquiesced found that their companies became significantly more profitable and productive. In 1914, Henry Ford took the lessons of these natural experiments to heart and cut shifts in his plants to eight hours without reducing pay, leading to an output boom. By 1938, that 40-hour workweek was enshrined into law by the Fair Labor Standards Act, which requires time-and-a-half pay beyond that threshold.
The strength of the law has been whittled away over recent decades, however, to the point that millions fewer Americans are guaranteed extra pay for extra work than in 1979. That allows employers to push more employees to put in more hours essentially free. President Barack Obama proposed an update in 2016 that would have offered new or strengthened overtime protection to over 13 million workers; it was struck down by the courts, and President Trump's version, proposed in March, will help 8.2 million fewer workers, thanks to a lower salary threshold and a failure to index it to inflation.
Business leaders seem to have forgotten the lessons they learned in the past: Humane schedules benefit employee and employer alike. China may have its 996 culture, but the United States doesn't fare much better. Nearly a third of us put in 45 hours or more each week, while nearly 10 million clock 60 or more. The average European puts in between 7 percent and 19 percent less time on the job.
Policies like a strong overtime rule can help us return to a world where everyone does better by working less. Business leaders like Jack Ma have to get with the program, too. Glorifying those who sacrifice nearly all of their waking hours at the altar of work harms everyone, from the chief executive to the custodian.

Progressive Capitalism Is Not an Oxymoron

Full text: Despite the lowest unemployment rates since the late 1960s, the American economy is failing its citizens. Some 90 percent have seen their incomes stagnate or decline in the past 30 years. This is not surprising, given that the United States has the highest level of inequality among the advanced countries and one of the lowest levels of opportunity -- with the fortunes of young Americans more dependent on the income and education of their parents than elsewhere.
But things don't have to be that way. There is an alternative: progressive capitalism. Progressive capitalism is not an oxymoron; we can indeed channel the power of the market to serve society.
In the 1980s, Ronald Reagan's regulatory "reforms," which reduced the ability of government to curb the excesses of the market, were sold as great energizers of the economy. But just the opposite happened: Growth slowed, and weirder still, this happened in the innovation capital of the world.
The sugar rush produced by President Trump's largess to corporations in the 2017 tax law didn't deal with any of these long-run problems, and is already fading. Growth is expected to be a little under 2 percent next year.
This is where we've descended to, but not where we have to stay. A progressive capitalism based on an understanding of what gives rise to growth and societal well-being gives us a way out of this quagmire and a way up for our living standards.
Standards of living began to improve in the late 18th century for two reasons: the development of science (we learned how to learn about nature and used that knowledge to increase productivity and longevity) and developments in social organization (as a society, we learned how to work together, through institutions like the rule of law, and democracies with checks and balances).
Key to both were systems of assessing and verifying the truth. The real and long-lasting danger of the Trump presidency is the risk it poses to these pillars of our economy and society, its attack on the very idea of knowledge and expertise, and its hostility to institutions that help us discover and assess the truth.
There is a broader social compact that allows a society to work and prosper together, and that, too, has been fraying. America created the first truly middle-class society; now, a middle-class life is increasingly out of reach for its citizens.
America arrived at this sorry state of affairs because we forgot that the true source of the wealth of a nation is the creativity and innovation of its people. One can get rich either by adding to the nation's economic pie or by grabbing a larger share of the pie by exploiting others -- abusing, for instance, market power or informational advantages. We confused the hard work of wealth creation with wealth-grabbing (or, as economists call it, rent-seeking), and too many of our talented young people followed the siren call of getting rich quickly.
Beginning with the Reagan era, economic policy played a key role in this dystopia: Just as forces of globalization and technological change were contributing to growing inequality, we adopted policies that worsened societal inequities. Even as economic theories like information economics (dealing with the ever-present situation where information is imperfect), behavioral economics and game theory arose to explain why markets on their own are often not efficient, fair, stable or seemingly rational, we relied more on markets and scaled back social protections.
The result is an economy with more exploitation -- whether it's abusive practices in the financial sector or the technology sector using our own data to take advantage of us at the cost of our privacy. The weakening of antitrust enforcement, and the failure of regulation to keep up with changes in our economy and the innovations in creating and leveraging market power, meant that markets became more concentrated and less competitive.
Politics has played a big role in the increase in corporate rent-seeking and the accompanying inequality. Markets don't exist in a vacuum; they have to be structured by rules and regulations, and those rules and regulations must be enforced. Deregulation of the financial sector allowed bankers to engage in both excessively risky activities and more exploitive ones. Many economists understood that trade with developing countries would drive down American wages, especially for those with limited skills, and destroy jobs. We could and should have provided more assistance to affected workers (just as we should provide assistance to workers who lose their jobs as a result of technological change), but corporate interests opposed it. A weaker labor market conveniently meant lower labor costs at home to complement the cheap labor businesses employed abroad.
We are now in a vicious cycle: Greater economic inequality is leading, in our money-driven political system, to more political inequality, with weaker rules and deregulation causing still more economic inequality.
If we don't change course matters will likely grow worse, as machines (artificial intelligence and robots) replace an increasing fraction of routine labor, including many of the jobs of the several million Americans making their living by driving.
The prescription follows from the diagnosis: It begins by recognizing the vital role that the state plays in making markets serve society. We need regulations that ensure strong competition without abusive exploitation, realigning the relationship between corporations and the workers they employ and the customers they are supposed to serve. We must be as resolute in combating market power as the corporate sector is in increasing it.
If we had curbed exploitation in all of its forms and encouraged wealth creation, we would have had a more dynamic economy with less inequality. We might have curbed the opioid crisis and avoided the 2008 financial crisis. If we had done more to blunt the power of oligopolies and strengthen the power of workers, and if we had held our banks accountable, the sense of powerlessness might not be so pervasive and Americans might have greater trust in our institutions.
There are many other areas in which government action is required. Markets on their own won't provide insurance against some of the most important risks we face, such as unemployment and disability. They won't efficiently provide pensions with low administrative costs and insurance against inflation. And they won't provide an adequate infrastructure or a decent education for everyone or engage in sufficient basic research.
Progressive capitalism is based on a new social contract between voters and elected officials, between workers and corporations, between rich and poor, and between those with jobs and those who are un- or underemployed.
Part of this new social contract is an expanded public option for many programs now provided by private entities or not at all. It was a mistake not to include the public option in Obamacare: It would have enriched choice and enhanced competition, lowering prices. But one can design public options in other arenas as well, for instance for retirement and mortgages. This new social contract will enable most Americans to once again have a middle-class life.
As an economist, I am always asked: Can we afford to provide this middle-class life for most, let alone all, Americans? Somehow, we did when we were a much poorer country in the years after World War II. In our politics, in our labor-market participation, and in our health we are already paying the price for our failures.
The neoliberal fantasy that unfettered markets will deliver prosperity to everyone should be put to rest. It is as fatally flawed as the notion after the fall of the Iron Curtain that we were seeing "the end of history" and that we would all soon be liberal democracies with capitalist economies.
Most important, our exploitive capitalism has shaped who we are as individuals and as a society. The rampant dishonesty we've seen from Wells Fargo and Volkswagen or from members of the Sackler family as they promoted drugs they knew were addictive -- this is what is to be expected in a society that lauds the pursuit of profits as leading, to quote Adam Smith, "as if by an invisible hand," to the well-being of society, with no regard to whether those profits derive from exploitation or wealth creation.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- A government report has concluded that the Trump administration's revised North American trade agreement would offer modest benefits to the economy, challenging the president's claims that the accord would make far-reaching changes.
Mr. Trump has reviled the quarter-century-old North American Free Trade Agreement as the worst trade pact in existence and blamed it for pushing up the trade deficit, or the gap between what the country imports and what it exports. Over the past year and a half, he gave his administration a mandate to improve the pact. In November, Canada, Mexico and the United States signed an updated accord, which the president rebranded as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, and the new deal is awaiting ratification from legislators in all three countries.
On Thursday, the United States International Trade Commission, a government body, released an independent analysis of the accord's potential effects on the country's economy, a report required by law before Congress votes on the deal.
The report found that the agreement would increase gross domestic product by 0.35 percent after inflation, or $68.2 billion, and create 175,700 jobs -- fewer than the economy has recently produced in a single month, on average. It would increase United States trade with Canada and Mexico by about 5 percent, as well as provide a modest lift to agriculture, services and manufacturing activity.
"In light of the size of the U.S. economy relative to the size of the Mexican and Canadian economies, as well as the reduction in tariff and nontariff barriers that has already taken place among the three countries under Nafta, the impact of the agreement on the U.S. economy is likely to be moderate," the commission said.
Critics of the accord seized on the findings. "This report confirms what has been clear since this deal was announced -- Donald Trump's Nafta represents at best a minor update to Nafta, which will offer only limited benefits to U.S. workers," said Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon.
The administration, however, saw the report as evidence of the pact's strengths, noting that the commission typically projects only modest benefits from trade agreements.
Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, said the commission's estimates of the deal's contribution to economic growth were twice as large as its estimates for the effects of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a 12-nation deal negotiated by the Obama administration. The commission has significantly updated its methodology, however, making comparisons difficult.
"There can be no doubt that the U.S.M.C.A. is a big win for America's economy," Mr. Lighthizer said.
Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, said he believed that the report had underestimated some of the deal's economic benefits, including provisions on intellectual property. But he said he was encouraged.
"I think that should be reassuring to anyone who is on the fence on this bill," he said.
Since negotiations began in August 2017, the administration has secured some substantive changes to Nafta, including modernizing protections on digital trade, adding labor and environmental protections, opening up the Canadian dairy market and adding rules to restrict governments from manipulating their currency.
Many of the changes have been updates to Nafta's existing framework. Other improvements were drawn from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Mr. Trump withdrew the United States from that agreement days after taking office, before Congress could act on it.
The Trump administration has also tightened regulations on how cars are manufactured -- for example, raising the percentage of a vehicle that needs to be made in North America for it to be tariff-free -- to encourage automaking in the United States.
The commission's report projected that rule changes in the automotive sector would result in many of the largest economic changes from the pact. It estimated that rules meant to bolster American automotive manufacturing would add more than 28,000 jobs and increase investment by $683 million per year.
But by raising the cost of producing cars, the auto provisions would actually reduce American car exports and weigh on the economy over all, the report said.
Those figures clashed with a rosier analysis of the automotive effects of the deal released by the Trump administration. Based on information provided by North American automotive manufacturers, Mr. Lighthizer's office estimated Thursday that the rule changes would result in $34 billion in investments in the United States, as well as $23 billion in annual purchases of American-made parts and 76,000 American jobs, all within five years.
A senior official in the trade representative's office said Thursday that the deal's auto provisions were "a substantial factor" in investments announced by Ford, General Motors, Toyota, Volkswagen and others. He said the updates to the agreement would close loopholes allowing companies to use more parts from countries like China and would help build an industry for autonomous and alternative-energy vehicles.
The trade commission's model essentially simulates what the United States economy of 2017 would have looked like had the new agreement been in place then. It makes several assumptions that could affect the economic impact, including the premise that there is little room for the economy to add additional jobs without also driving up wage growth for workers.
Perhaps most notably for Mr. Trump, who views America's trade deficit as a measure of economic success, the model assumes no change in the balance of trade between the United States, Mexico and Canada.
Some of the largest economic benefits of the pact, according to the trade commission, would come from the parts of the deal that codify the free flow of data across borders -- measures that have been supported by technology companies.
Industry groups called for the pact's quick passage into law. Linda Dempsey, the vice president for international economic affairs at the National Association of Manufacturers, said that the deal was "a win for manufacturers."
Jordan Haas, the director of trade policy at the Internet Association, said the report underlined that the deal's digital trade provisions were "critical to America's future economic success" and "mean jobs and opportunities in every state."
Still, the trade commission's report is likely to add fuel to criticisms of the agreement, especially among some Democrats, who have criticized the deal's environmental, labor and pharmaceutical provisions.
The Trump administration began the trade negotiations with the aim of appealing to more populist Democrats, who have long criticized Nafta for sending jobs out of the country. That support is more critical than ever for the administration, since the pact will probably need at least two dozen Democratic votes to pass the House of Representatives if every Republican votes for it, an outcome that is not guaranteed.
The revised deal includes changes meant to court labor unions and liberal politicians, including a minimum-wage requirement for the auto industry and the end of a special system of arbitration for corporations.
But as a vote in Congress approaches, opposition on the left appears to be hardening. Democrats say they are concerned that the agreement won't adequately protect the environment and labor rights, and that its intellectual-property protections for the pharmaceutical industry could undermine legislative efforts to make health care more affordable.
While some Republican lawmakers objected to the Trump administration's negotiating goals during the talks, most now appear to support the deal's passage, in part to provide more certainty to companies in their districts.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- As soon as the Federal Reserve chairman, Jerome H. Powell, finished speaking at his December news conference, it was clear, even to him, that he had blown it. Stocks were tumbling. Analysts worried that the Fed was steering the economy into recession.
And President Trump was furious.
Four months later, Mr. Powell and the Fed have mostly repaired the damage, ending a steady march of interest rate increases and signaling that their next policy move may well be a rate cut if the economy continues to soften. Markets have rallied and recession fears have cooled. But one challenge has only worsened for Mr. Powell: Mr. Trump and his escalating anger at the Fed.
The president's relentless attacks on the central bank, which he blames for slowing United States economic growth, are putting Mr. Powell in a bind as he tries to bolster the economy without feeding fears that he is buckling under political pressure and damaging the integrity of an independent Fed.
Publicly and privately, Mr. Powell rejects any suggestion that Mr. Trump has influenced his, or the Fed's, actions. Mr. Powell said this year that he would not resign if the president asked him to. Associates say he is prepared to fight any attempt by Mr. Trump to try to fire him.
Yet while Mr. Powell repeatedly denies that Mr. Trump is changing the Fed's course, the central bank has largely moved in the direction that the president wants. For now, there is little distinction between Mr. Trump's view that rates should stay low because the economy is strong and the Fed's view that rates should remain low because the economy is fragile.
How Mr. Powell handles the next few months will be a critical test of his leadership skills. A year into his chairmanship, Mr. Powell is trying to guide the Fed through a highly uncertain moment in the global economy, with slowing growth in Europe and China as well as in the United States, which is feeling the waning effects of Mr. Trump's $1.5 trillion tax cut and pain from his trade war.
After four consecutive interest rate increases last year on the back of an accelerating economy, Mr. Powell is now executing an abrupt shift in the Fed's efforts to balance growth and inflation concerns, while under assault from the president who appointed him to the job -- and now regrets it.
"Well, I personally think the Fed should drop rates," Mr. Trump told reporters this month. He has said he intends to nominate political allies like Herman Cain and Stephen Moore to the Fed's seven-member board -- two partisan candidates whose appointments would be a departure from the tradition of Fed leaders, who are more insulated from politics.
Mr. Powell is a lawyer, financier and Fed veteran, chosen by Mr. Trump in part because he fit the president's "central casting" image of a central banker. According to interviews with colleagues, friends and lawmakers, Mr. Powell has spent the past several months pushing the Fed toward more growth-oriented policies, not because Mr. Trump is demanding it, but because he believes economic data have given the Fed no other choice.
"One thing that has served him well, and has served the committee well, is to always take a fresh look at what's happening," said John C. Williams, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and vice chairman of the Federal Open Market Committee. "Not get caught up in 'We said this in September,' or, 'We said this in November,' but really to say, 'What do we think is right?' He's focused on, 'Let's get it right, and then let's do our best to explain it, in terms of why we've shifted our views."'
Mr. Powell's difficulties festered for much of last year, as the economy soared with stimulus from Mr. Trump's tax cuts, more government spending and increased business confidence. Unemployment fell below 4 percent -- approaching five-decade lows -- wages began to climb and economic growth was heading toward 3 percent.
The Fed, convinced the economy could withstand higher borrowing costs, raised rates three times. But in the weeks leading to the Fed's final meeting of 2018, ominous signs began to emerge, suggesting that China's economy, and the global economy as a whole, was slowing. A key indicator based on bond prices was flashing warnings of a possible recession. Yet the Fed raised rates a fourth time at that December meeting, a move that even some Democratic economists called unnecessary.
Mr. Powell tried to pull off what Fed insiders call a "dovish hike" -- raising rates while conveying to markets that the end of such increases was in sight. But in Fed forecasts released that day, it appeared that officials intended two rate increases in 2019.
Markets, already spooked, plunged during a news conference after the meeting, as investors interpreted Mr. Powell's comments as suggesting more rate increases were coming soon, even if the economy slowed. Perhaps most worrisome to investors was his suggestion that another tool it had been deploying to remove stimulus from the economy -- the shrinking of its giant portfolio of bonds -- would continue on "autopilot."
In the days that followed, Mr. Trump and his allies called for Mr. Powell to resign or be fired.
"If only the Fed would loosen up a bit so that we don't have a recession," Mr. Moore, the conservative economic commentator whom Mr. Trump intends to nominate to the Fed board, said in a radio interview in December. He argued that the president could fire Mr. Powell for "cause," saying the Fed chairman was "wrecking our economy."
Mr. Powell spent the holidays holed up at a family gathering in South Florida watching financial market swings, negative corporate news and shaky economic data -- and plotted a way to correct the mistakes. He scratched out bullet points on a notepad and waited for an opportunity to publicly pivot.
In early January, armed with his handwritten bullet points and arrows signifying the sequence in which he intended to deliver them, Mr. Powell provided an update on the Fed's outlook at an American Economic Association panel in Atlanta.
This time, Mr. Powell left no chances. He made clear that the Fed would react accordingly if the economy showed signs of weakness and "wouldn't hesitate" to change its approach to winnowing its giant portfolio of government-backed bonds.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index soared 3.4 percent.
On this occasion, Mr. Powell was driving the policy shift himself. While the Fed makes policy through a committee of representatives from reserve banks around the United States, he had not had time to make phone calls to most of the other 16 officials before changing the tone.
Several weeks later, the Fed released a unanimous statement saying it would "be patient" as it determined the path of interest rates.
In March, the Fed left rates unchanged in a range of 2.25 percent to 2.5 percent and downgraded the 2019 growth forecast, citing global slowdowns. In his news conference, Mr. Powell left open the possibility that the Fed's next move on interest rates could be a cut. He also said that the Fed planned to stop shrinking its portfolio of government bonds, known as quantitative tightening, later this year.
While economists and investors applauded the move, Mr. Trump seethed, blaming Mr. Powell for slowing what he believed would have been even stronger growth in 2018 and putting the economy at a disadvantage.
"Had the Fed not mistakenly raised interest rates, especially since there is very little inflation, and had they not done the ridiculously timed quantitative tightening, the 3.0% GDP, & Stock Market, would have both been much higher & World Markets would be in a better place!" Mr. Trump tweeted.
This month, the president called on the Fed to cut rates and to resume efforts to pump up the economy by buying bonds, a tool it previously used to help lift the economy out of recession.
Among colleagues, Mr. Powell has emphasized the importance of not letting political considerations cause the central bank to err in either of two directions. One risk would be to bend toward the will of elected officials, which could put the economy's long-term stability at risk.
He has also mentioned a more subtle risk: stubbornly insisting on doing the opposite of what a president seeks to prove independence, and in that way doing the wrong thing. That, too, could be viewed as political interference.
"He's in a world where there is inevitably going to be speculation about a political motive," said Janet L. Yellen, Mr. Powell's predecessor as Fed chief. "You can't avoid that. The only reasonable thing you can do is get it all out of your head and make decisions based on facts and analysis, and that's what Jay is doing."
Some Democrats, particularly in the Senate, have praised Mr. Powell for standing firm against Mr. Trump, while criticizing him and the Fed for a string of recent actions to loosen banking regulations imposed after the 2008 financial crisis.
Other lawmakers who have spoken with Mr. Powell in recent months say they have not agreed with his decisions but view him as doing the best he can.
Senator Tim Scott, Republican of South Carolina and a member of the Banking Committee, gave Mr. Powell a "B, B-plus" grade, while contending that the pressure from Mr. Trump reflects a president's typical desire to build a "thriving economy."
Mr. Powell "has done a good job trying to find a balance and equilibrium between trying to allow an economy that is really hot not overheat," Mr. Scott said, "while also not throwing a wet blanket over it."
Another committee member, Senator Tina Smith, Democrat of Minnesota, called the possible nominations of Mr. Moore and Mr. Cain "an attack on Fed independence" but said she was confident Mr. Powell would not be affected by them.
"I think that he is walking a very fine and difficult line," Ms. Smith said. "He should be motivated by what he thinks is the right thing to do, and not political pressure. Having talked to him, I think he's keenly aware of that -- of not becoming somebody's political tool."
Even some White House officials say Mr. Powell has impressed them with his poise -- and his pivot.
A senior administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to publicly discuss the Fed, said Mr. Powell handled the criticism "gracefully." Asked what Mr. Trump thinks of Mr. Powell now, the official paused before finally answering.
The president would "like to see lower rates," he said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

The First Subway Fare Increase Took Almost Half a Century

Full text: [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox .]
It was July 1, 1948, or, as many subway riders called it, "D-Day." Ever since the New York City subway started rolling in 1904 the fare had been a nickel.
Now, after 44 years, the price was doubling.
So the lead-up to Dime Day was, naturally, marked by widespread anger and controversy. In fact, one legal battle made it all the way to the United States Supreme Court.
Well before then the issue of whether to increase the fare had challenged many mayors, become the subject of campaign promises and provoked fierce clashes with powerful interest groups.
Of course, all fare hikes are unpopular, including the one set to go into effect on April 21 with riders grumbling about having to pay for an unreliable system. In 1970, dozens were arrested while protesting an increase. In 1995, an increase was unsuccessfully challenged in federal court as a civil rights violation.
But none were as fiercely contested as the first one. The nickel fare held steady through two world wars, the Great Depression and 10 mayors. New York City kept the same fare long after other cities, including Chicago and Philadelphia, had raised their fares.
"Almost every transit property in the United States raised its fare in the 1920s, and because of the political pressure and the fact that the fare had become a political issue, New York didn't," said Peter Derrick, the author of "Tunneling to the Future: The Story of the Great Subway Expansion That Saved New York."
But as a result, he said, the subway started "to fall apart because there was never enough money to keep the system going, to keep the system operating, as well as to maintain it."
The nickel fare was part of the agreement the city had with the companies that operated the subway, the Interborough Rapid Transit and Brooklyn Rapid Transit Companies, both of which came to be widely reviled by New Yorkers for their poor service. The IRT sought to set aside the contract and raise the fare. The city challenged the move in a case that reached the Supreme Court. The case was sent back to state courts, where the company ultimately lost.
When the two privately-run lines were unified with the city-run line in 1940, the fare remained a nickel.
The push to raise the fare gained steam after World War II. Ridership was soaring -- on weekdays in 1946 average ridership was more than 6.4 million -- and the city was emerging from years of wartime spending cuts. The subway had become crowded and unsafe and significant investment was needed to upgrade and expand the system.
A resolution put before the City Council declared that the subway was "in such a deplorable state of neglect and disrepair as to be a disgrace to The City of New York and a menace to public safety, heath and decency."
The city was operating the subway at a loss forcing it to spend less on other services like hospitals, schools, prisons, parks and libraries and other critical functions. (The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, a state agency controlled by the governor that now operates the subway, was not created until the 1960s.)
The nickel fare was also seen as preventing pay raises for city employees, including transit workers, and critics argued that the city was essentially providing a free service to riders.
The real estate industry lobbied for a fare increase because property owners were seeking relief from a municipal tax used to help pay for the subway, though they did not find much support.
"There wasn't a lot of sympathy among working people for the complaints of real estate that they'd have to lift a heavier burden in terms of financing the government," said Joshua Freeman, a history professor at Queens College and the Graduate Center of the City University of New York. "This was a moment where there was a pretty strong kind of -- today we call it populist, I might even call it class-based -- kind of way of thinking about these public problems."
Increasing the fare would hurt many New Yorkers struggling to make ends meet.
"It was a real concern," Mr. Freeman said. "The doubling of the transit fare represented an actual significant pinch in the standard of living of working New Yorkers, the vast majority of whom used public transportation to get to work."
The mayor, William O'Dwyer, had originally been opposed to raising the fare, arguing that it would amount to a "harsh and unbearable tax" on low-income families. But Mr. O'Dwyer, realizing that the city faced a growing financial crisis, appointed a committee to consider the issue.
The committee found that it was "confronted with the panorama of a city bursting at its seams and our community asking for increased public services" and that such services were suffering. The panel recommended a fare hike and Mr. O'Dwyer, facing what some described as the "inexorable arithmetic" of the city's finances, became the first Democratic mayor to break with the party's commitment to the nickel fare.
The mayor was aided by fissures among some labor groups, who had long been opposed to a rise. Some came to see a fare raise as the only viable path toward a wage increase for transit workers and in a prominent move, Michael J. Quill, the leader of the Transport Workers Union, split with other labor groups and supported an increase.
An editorial in The New York Times captured the mood of the moment when it noted that "we watched the skies yesterday, and City Hall probably did too, to see whether the heavens would fall after the Mayor announced the end of the five-cent fare, but nothing happened."
The day of the fare increase, described as a "siege of dimes" in an article in The Times, turned into something of a spectacle. The mayor had been on vacation in Puerto Rico but flew back to supervise the change. Hundreds of police officers were deployed to subway stations during rush hour to prevent chaos as passengers adjusted to the new fare.
The city had prepared for months, adjusting and testing thousands of turnstiles to ensure they would accept dimes.
Hundreds gathered at midnight to witness the last nickel and first dime fares at the Times Square station. There Carmen Gherdel, 30, of Queens, was the last one to pay five cents, while Esther Pollack, 22, of Brooklyn, became the first to pay a dime.
While there were some delays and confusion, as well as faulty turnstiles, New Yorkers quickly adapted. The Times noted that the "heat-plagued men and women of Gotham poured through changed-over subway turnstiles after midnight last night, meekly as sheep turn into a familiar fold, dropping dimes instead of nickels without protest."
The increase would leave a lasting legacy, playing a role in the eventual formation of the transportation authority as a way of insulating the subway, including debates about the fare, from the kind of political gamesmanship that kept the fare a nickel for nearly half a century.
The 1948 increase "sets the stage for what you now ultimately have today where there have been regular fare increases over two- or three-year periods to keep up with inflation," said Andrew Sparberg, a transportation historian and the author of "From a Nickel to a Token: The Journey from Board of Transportation to MTA." "People are always going to be angry about the subway fare but they realize that it's going to go up regardless of whether they like it or not."

Full text: President Omar Hassan al-Bashir loved to tell the story about his broken tooth.
As a schoolboy working on a construction site, he told supporters in January, he fell and broke the tooth while carrying a heavy load. Instead of seeking treatment he rinsed his mouth with saltwater and kept working.
Later, after he joined the army, he refused a silver tooth implant because he wanted to remember his hardships. "This one," he said, pointing to a gap in his mouth, as supporters erupted into laughter.
The story was a way for Mr. al-Bashir, who was ousted Thursday after 30 years of iron-fisted rule over Sudan, to play up his humble origins -- to show that he remained a man of the people who, like him, hailed from dusty farming villages on the Nile.
The folksy image was a jarring contrast with Mr. al-Bashir's image in the West, where he was often seen as a heartless warmonger, as a coddler of terrorists like Osama bin Laden and as the accused architect of a genocidal purge in Darfur that killed hundreds of thousands of people. Since 2009, the International Criminal Court has sought to arrest him on war crimes charges that include murder, rape and extermination.
But global notoriety was never much of a problem for Mr. al-Bashir, 75, at home in Sudan, a vast African country with a long history of war and suffering. He outwitted rivals who underestimated him, steered a decade-long oil boom that swelled Sudan's middle classes, and forged a network of security forces and armed militias to fight his wars that some likened to a spider's web with Mr. al-Bashir at its center.
That carefully constructed edifice of power crumbled this week as thousands of protesters massed outside his Khartoum residence, chanting slogans and braving gunfire as rival gangs of soldiers exchanged fire. The oil money was running low, the economy was in tatters and young Sudanese, in particular, had had enough. The spider had to go.
"Just fall, that is all!" they chanted.
On Thursday morning, the military ousted him, ending his 30-year rule in the face of the sweeping demonstrations. It said it had taken Mr. al-Bashir into custody, dissolved the government and suspended the Constitution.
Representatives of the principal protest group, the Sudanese Professionals Association, which had been expecting a statement from the military and were preparing to negotiate a transition to civilian rule, greeted the announcement with disappointment.
"What has been just stated is for us a coup, and it is not acceptable," said Sara Abdelgalil, a spokeswoman for the group. "Our request for a civilian transitional government has been ignored."
Born into a farming family in a dusty village 100 miles north of Khartoum, the capital, Mr. al-Bashir served as a paratroop commander in the army. In 1989, he headed an Islamist junta that ousted Prime Minister Sadiq al-Mahdi in a bloodless coup, Sudan's fourth military takeover since independence in 1956.
For the first decade of his rule, though, Mr. al-Bashir, was seen as a frontman for a more powerful force -- the cleric Hassan al-Turabi, a smooth-talking, Sorbonne-educated ideologue with sweeping ideas about embedding Shariah law deep in Sudan's diverse society and institutions.
International jihadists flocked to Sudan in that period, among them Osama bin Laden, who bought a house in an upmarket Khartoum district and invested in agriculture and construction. In 1993, the United States blacklisted the Bashir government as an international sponsor of terrorism, and it imposed sanctions four years later.
In 1999, after a falling-out, Mr. al-Bashir outmaneuvered Mr. al-Turabi and cast him into prison. He turned back to the army to underwrite his authority, forging relationships that spanned the military, the security forces and the country's tribal leadership.
Mr. al-Bashir assiduously attended the funerals and weddings of military officers, often sending presents of sugar, tea or dried goods to their families. He held an open house once a week where commissioned officers could drop in and meet with him, said Alex de Waal, a professor at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, and an expert on Sudan.
"He's like the spider at the center of the web -- he could pick up on the smallest tremor, then deftly use his personalized political retail skills to manage the politics of the army," he said.
Mr. al-Bashir used a similar approach to manage provincial leaders and tribal chiefs, Mr. de Waal added. "Most of them became militarized and enmeshed in one of the popular defense forces. He has that extraordinary network, and it's all in his head."
That style of personalist autocracy was put to use in battling the insurgency in southern Sudan, where rebels from different ethnic groups with Christian or animist beliefs were fighting for independence. During the 21-year war, the Sudanese air force dropped crude barrel bombs over remote villages in the south and sided with vicious local militias recruited by Mr. al-Bashir and his officers.
At the same time, Sudan discovered oil. After the first barrels were pumped in 1999, living standards gradually rose in one of Africa's most desperately poor countries. New roads appeared, remote villages gained water and electricity, and shiny buildings rose in Khartoum.
"Those were the fat years," said Magdi el-Gizouli, a fellow at the Rift Valley Institute.
In 2005, under international pressure, Mr. al-Bashir signed a peace deal with the southern rebels, overcoming opposition from his hard-liners who wanted to keep fighting. But by then another uprising had erupted in western Darfur that would define his legacy.
There, a pro-government militia known as the Janjaweed cut a bloody swath through remote villages, quelling an insurgency led by rebels. At least 300,000 people are estimated to have died.
Mr. Bashir is facing two arrest warrants from the International Criminal Court for charges in the Darfur conflict that include genocide. He was the first sitting head of state to be targeted with an arrest warrant by the Hague-based court.
"This was his biggest blunder," Mr. el-Gizouli said. "He outsourced the war to these militias, the Darfuri pastoralists. And he created a massively bloated security establishment with competing structures."
Mr. al-Bashir was charged with crimes that included murder, rape, torture and extermination, and his villainous reputation was amplified by campaigning celebrities like the actor George Clooney who denounced him as the embodiment of a sectarian, ruthless regime. But predictions he would become "a fugitive, a man on a wanted poster," were only partially borne out.
Defying the court, Mr. al-Bashir traveled to Kenya, Egypt, Nigeria and Saudi Arabia, although a visit to South Africa in 2015 was cut short when a court considered whether to arrest him. Some experts criticized the indictments as legally flawed and politically counterproductive.
Mr. al-Bashir portrayed himself as the victim of an international witch hunt led by an ungrateful West. He complained that the United States had reneged on its promises to lift sanctions in return for peace in the south. Buoyed by oil wealth, he swept to victory in the 2010 election, featuring posters that showed him standing proudly before new roads, dams and factories -- even if 40 percent of Sudan's people remained below the poverty line.
In 2011, South Sudan voted to secede, becoming an independent country and taking with it three-quarters of Sudan's oil reserves. As revenues dried up, Sudan's economy weakened badly, and Mr. al-Bashir started to face serious opposition.
Armed riot police brutally suppressed street protests against soaring food prices in September 2013, killing as many as 170 people, according to Human Rights Watch. Torture and abuse in Sudan's jails became rampant, the group said.
Mr. al-Bashir reached wide into the region for funding and support, often flitting between rivals in search of the best deal. In 2013, he hosted the Iranian president at the time, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, in Khartoum, as part of a putative courtship. Two years later, he joined an Arab alliance fighting on one side of Yemen's war, led by Iran's archenemy Saudi Arabia.
Last year he pivoted from his traditional ally, Egypt, to Ethiopia as part of a dispute over a giant hydroelectric dam that Ethiopia is building on the Nile. In recent months, as more protests erupted, he turned to Saudi Arabia's Persian Gulf rival, Qatar, for help.
The lifting of American sanctions in 2017 might have helped Mr. al-Bashir. But the State Department kept Sudan on its list of terrorism sponsors, stymieing any influx of foreign investment. By 2018 Sudan's economy was in free-fall, with an inflation rate of 72 percent, long lines at fuel stations and even a shortage of bank notes. The urban middle classes, dismayed to see their living standards collapsing, revolted.
A protest against the soaring price of bread in Atbara on Dec. 19 quickly spread to towns and cities across the country, in protests led by doctors and other professionals. Public anger grew as young doctors, some from wealthy families, were killed.
In January, Mr. al-Bashir contemptuously dismissed the protesters, telling the "rats to go back to their holes" and saying he would move aside only for another army officer, or at the ballot box.
But on the whole his forces reacted with relative restraint, killing dozens rather than hundreds of protesters. The demonstrations, often wildcat affairs in different Khartoum neighborhoods, turned into a daily occurrence.
On April 6, in their largest protest yet, demonstrators made it to the gates of Mr. al-Bashir's home at the headquarters of the Sudanese army. The protest coincided with the anniversary of the 1985 uprising that toppled the regime of another unpopular Sudanese leader, the dictator Gaafar Nimeiry.
It was the start of the final push that led to his ouster on Thursday. His supposedly folksy touch had fully deserted him. The military and security leaders he fostered for years told him it was time to leave.
Like many military rulers, Mr. al-Bashir liked to claim that power had been foisted upon him, and that he wielded it reluctantly. "This country does not encourage anyone to enjoy power," he said after he seized control in 1989. "This country is exhausted. It has collapsed and fallen."
Critics say he left Sudan in much the same condition. Less clear, though, is whether his successors can change it quickly. The tattered economy needs a huge cash injection, and current conflicts in the Sudanese regions of Blue Nile or South Kordofan are unlikely to abate. Past uprisings, in the 1960s and 1980s, quickly saw a reversion to military control after a few years of erratic civilian rule.
"People want change, but Sudan's problems are structural, not a matter of personality," said Aly Verjee, an analyst at the United States Institute of Peace. "Even with Bashir gone, Sudan will not be healed overnight."

Full text: ON THE VENEZUELA-COLOMBIA BORDER -- She is 15 years old, pregnant, hungry and alone. Deisimar sat on a bench in a park in Maicao, just inside Colombia, and wept as she told her story -- the story of Venezuela.
Deisimar was born in an oil-rich, middle-class Venezuela. Then everything began to collapse at a pace reminiscent of Weimar Germany or Syria during the civil war.
In the oil hub of Maracaibo, Deisimar's family lost electricity, reliable running water, health care and, finally, food. Venezuela's inflation may reach 10 million percent this year, the International Monetary Fund says, and some people root through garbage or eat rats to survive.
"We had no money to buy food, so I came here," Deisimar explained. Complicating the situation, she had become pregnant by her equally impoverished 18-year-old boyfriend. Contraception has become unavailable or unaffordable: A single condom now costs as much as a couple of pounds of rice and more than a tank of gas.
"I don't have enough to eat, so how could I pay for birth control?" Deisimar asked me.
She walks about selling medicines from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. each day. She eats at a soup kitchen when she can, but there are long lines because there are so many desperate Venezuelans here, with hundreds sleeping in the park each night.
Deisimar hasn't been to a clinic for any prenatal care, and she doesn't know what will happen to her. "Nobody in my family knows I'm pregnant," she said.
After traveling along the border with Mercy Corps, an aid group helping Venezuelans in this border region, I ache with stories from so many people like Deisimar. More than 3.4 million Venezuelans have fled their country so far, according to the United Nations, and millions more are expected to follow this year.
American liberals sometimes sympathize with the Venezuelan president, NicolÃ¡s Maduro, out of instinctive resistance to President Trump. Don't. Maduro has been a catastrophe for Venezuelans, and Trump is right to join Canada and more than 50 other countries in recognizing the head of the National Assembly, Juan GuaidÃ³, as the legitimate leader of Venezuela.
The problem is that Trump's saber-rattling backfires, helping Maduro by playing into a narrative of Yankee imperialism, and his politicization of humanitarian aid makes it less likely that starving people will actually be fed.
Here's a three-part strategy that some other countries are already moving toward: Nudge Mexico (which has refused to back GuaidÃ³) to play a more constructive role; work with Canada, Peru and Colombia to coax and coerce Venezuela's generals away from Maduro; and offer Maduro a comfortable retirement abroad if he steps down, versus a prison cell if he remains.
Venezuelans overwhelmingly told me that they want tougher international action to dislodge Maduro. "I lost my jobs because of sanctions," said Claritza Rojas, who used to work for P.D.V.S.A., the state oil company, and now is homeless in Maicao. "They affect us, but pressure on Maduro is still good."
Conditions may get worse, for the economy and health system are virtually in free fall. A university survey found that two-thirds of Venezuelans had lost weight -- an average of 25 pounds in a single year.
"Sometimes we went two or three days without eating anything," a mother, Anyi Coromoto, 25, told me, a day after arriving from Maracaibo with her son, Dylan. Coromoto is sticklike and weighs just 93 pounds. Dylan, 1 year old, weighs 11 pounds and was immediately hospitalized to save his life.
In a world that has mostly treated migrants wretchedly, Colombia is playing a heroic role in providing such care. The country has admitted perhaps two million Venezuelans -- often allowing them to work, attend school and receive free health care. And ordinary Colombians routinely give food to hungry Venezuelans on the street; the world has much to learn from warmhearted Colombians.
Still, the bureaucracy often doesn't work at the grass roots, and I found many Venezuelan children whom local schools refused to admit because they were already too crowded. In the city of Riohacha, I met a large extended family living in a parking lot, and none of the kids have been able to attend school.
One girl's great-grandmother had been illiterate; the grandmother had gone to primary school and learned to read; and the mother had been to ninth grade. But because of the crisis in Venezuela and the difficulty attending school in Colombia, the girl, 12-year-old Yanethzy SÃ¡nchez, has not been to school for three years and can't read even simple words.
Her 18-year-old sister died last year from pneumonia, and Yanethzy, once outgoing, is now herself fearful and withdrawn. "She never leaves the parking lot," her mom fretted. It seems that she may never get an education, like others in Venezuela's lost generation.
I asked Yanethzy if she could write her name. She couldn't. I asked her what three times four was; she looked blank. I tried another: What is four plus six?
She looked at her feet and there was a long silence. Finally, embarrassed, she suggested in Spanish, "16?"

Full text: Stocks closed higher on Wall Street on Wednesday as solid gains by technology companies helped the market recoup some of its losses from a day earlier.
Small-company stocks also stood out, beating the rest of the market. Banks, retailers and homebuilders also notched gains. Utilities were the biggest laggard.
Investors appeared to welcome new insights from the Federal Reserve's last meeting of policymakers. Minutes from the two-day March meeting showed that a majority of Fed officials believed they could keep interest rates unchanged the rest of this year.
The rally was a reversal for the market following a slide on Tuesday that ended an eight-day winning streak as investors turned their attention to the next wave of corporate earnings.
"It was just a little bit of an overreaction yesterday," said Karyn Cavanaugh, senior markets strategist at Voya Investment Management. "This is a little bit of an uneasy period because we're waiting for earnings to start."
The S&P 500 index rose 10.01 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,888.21. The Dow Jones industrial average recovered from an early slide to gain 6.58 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 26,157.16. The Nasdaq added 54.97 points, or 0.7 percent, to 7,964.24.
Despite a downturn in stocks on Tuesday, the market has been steadily gaining in 2019. The S&P 500 is up 15.2 percent for the year.
Bond prices rose, sending yields lower, after the government reported that a key measure of consumer price inflation remained in check last month. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.47 percent from 2.50 percent late Tuesday.
Traders turned their attention Wednesday to corporate earnings, as Delta Air Lines kicked off the first-quarter earnings reporting season. The company's results easily beat forecasts, sending its shares and those of other big airlines higher.
Levi Strauss also gained 4 percent after swinging to a quarterly profit in its first period since becoming a publicly traded company again.
Analysts expect first-quarter earnings for the S&P 500 index to contract for the first time in nearly three years and are closely tracking forecasts for the remainder of the 2019.
"Earnings are going to really be the barometer for what's going on with global growth," Ms. Cavanaugh said. "A lot of people are expecting negative earnings growth. I think we're going to be positively surprised, and that will help investors feel a little bit more at ease."
The Fed meeting minutes showed that most Fed officials last month believed that economic conditions would likely warrant keeping the Fed's benchmark policy unchanged for the rest of this year. Several officials said their view could shift in either direction based on incoming data, according to minutes of the meeting.
At the meeting, the Fed left its key policy rate unchanged and trimmed its rate hikes outlook this year from two to none. Some economists believe the Fed could actually start cutting rates later this year if the economy slows further.
Technology stocks led the market higher Wednesday. Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices rose 2.2 percent.
Financial companies also notched gains. Invesco climbed 2.4 percent and Goldman Sachs Group rose 1.2 perent.
Delta Air Lines shares lifted off after it gave investors a better than-expected quarterly report and forecast. The stock jumped as much as 2 percent before giving up some of its early gains. It shares gained 1.6 percent.
Shares in other airlines also rose. American Airlines Group gained 2.1 percent and Southwest Airlines added 1.4 percent.
Energy futures ended mostly higher. Benchmark United States crude rose 1 percent to settle at $64.61 a barrel.
The dollar fell to 110.96 yen from 111.11 yen on Tuesday. The euro strengthened to $1.1271 from $1.1267.
Gold rose $5.60 to $1,309.10 an ounce.

Fed Froze Rates Over Fears of Global Slump

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve officials were worried about slowing economic growth abroad and the fading effects of President Trump's tax cuts when they decided in March to pause interest rate increases and cut economic growth forecasts for 2019, according to minutes from the meeting released on Wednesday.
The minutes showed that members of the Federal Open Market Committee judged consumer spending and business investment to be slowing in the first quarter of the year, and that they "generally expected the growth rate of real G.D.P. this year to step down from the pace seen over 2018," which was 3 percent.
Some Fed officials raised concerns that complications with Britain's withdrawal from the European Union or the Trump administration's trade talks with China could further hurt growth this year, and "a few" worried that high levels of debt corporations have taken on during the expansion could exacerbate a downturn in the United States. Officials showed little concern over the possibility that inflation could surge this year.
"A number of participants judged that economic growth in the remaining quarters of 2019 and in the subsequent couple of years would likely be a little lower, on balance, than they had previously forecast," the minutes said. "Reasons cited for these downward revisions included disappointing news on global growth and less of a boost from fiscal policy than had previously been anticipated."
After raising interest rates four times in 2018, Fed officials left them unchanged in March, citing subdued inflation and increased challenges to global growth. They surprised financial markets by releasing projections showing that the typical Fed official does not expect any changes to interest rates this year, down from the two increases that the Fed said it expected in December. And they announced a faster-than-expected end to the winnowing of the Fed's giant portfolio of bonds, which it accumulated in an effort to stoke economic growth after the financial crisis.
The Fed also reduced its 2019 growth forecast to 2.1 percent -- a full percentage point less than what the Trump administration predicts for the year.
Those revisions, along with muted inflation pressures, prompted most Fed officials to concur that interest rates would likely stay unchanged in 2019. "A majority of participants expected that the evolution of the economic outlook and risks to the outlook would likely warrant leaving the target range unchanged for the remainder of the year," the minutes said.
In a news conference after the meeting, the Fed chairman, Jerome H. Powell, called the domestic economy "strong" but said the Fed would be patient -- and attentive to economic data -- before deciding its next move on interest rates.
"Data arriving since September suggest that growth is slowing somewhat more than expected," he said.
Taking questions from reporters, Mr. Powell did not rule out the Fed's next move being a rate cut, as many investors now expect. "The data that we're seeing are not currently sending a signal which suggests moving in either direction for me," he said, "which is really why we're being patient."
Mr. Powell is under intense pressure from Mr. Trump to keep interest rates low and take new measures to stimulate growth. On Friday, Mr. Trump called for the Fed to cut rates and to resume its bond-buying program to goose the economy. The president has previously criticized Mr. Powell for the Fed's rate hikes, which he said slowed economic growth, and has expressed frustration with his Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin, who recommended the Fed chair to Mr. Trump.
At an event held at the International Monetary Fund on Wednesday, Mr. Mnuchin defended Mr. Powell and praised him for making interest decisions based on economic data.
"I do trust Chairman Powell to get it right," Mr. Mnuchin said during a moderated discussion. "I see no reason why his job isn't safe."
He also weighed in for the first time on Mr. Trump's plans to nominate Herman Cain, a former businessman and Republican presidential candidate, to the Fed, along with one of his economic advisers, Stephen Moore.
Mr. Mnuchin said that while he disagrees with Mr. Cain's call for a return to the Gold Standard, he believes that both Mr. Cain and Mr. Moore would be good members of the board. And he dismissed criticism that the president was trying to interfere with the Fed's independence by choosing political allies for the seven-member Fed board.
"It is the president's job to nominate people to the Fed," Mr. Mnuchin said. "People talk about this like there's some political aspect. It's the president's job, like anything else, to send these nominations to the senate."
Republican senators expressed concerns this week about Mr. Cain, whose White House run was derailed by multiple allegations of sexual harassment from several women. Asked on Wednesday if Mr. Cain's nomination was safe, Mr. Trump offered only a limited vote of confidence.
"I like Herman Cain, and Herman will make that determination," he said. "He's just somebody I like a lot. As to how he's doing in the process, that I don't know. Herman's a great guy and I hope he does well."

Full text: NEW DELHI -- It is the biggest election in history.
Across India, from the Himalayan mountains to the Andaman Islands in the Bay of Bengal, the first wave of millions of citizens started casting ballots Thursday in a five-week-long vote to choose a new Parliament, which will select a prime minister.
India is the world's largest democracy, the most populous nation after China, and a pivotal geopolitical power. And it has never before held an election of this magnitude: 900 million eligible voters; at least 11 million poll workers; 2.3 million electronic voting machines; 2,000 political parties; and special trains, boats, helicopters and even elephants to transport voting equipment.
The race is a referendum on Narendra Modi, the powerful prime minister who is up for re-election. One of the most polarizing figures India has produced in decades, Mr. Modi has championed an assertive brand of Hindu nationalist politics that strives to elevate India's Hindu identity but has sharply divided this country.
Many Indians appreciate his intensity, which he constantly demonstrates in huge rallies where hundreds of thousands of people gather under the hot sun to hear him thunder about being India's watchman -- his new campaign slogan -- and how he is the best candidate to preside over this dizzyingly diverse nation of 1.3 billion.
Many Indians believe that the Modi administration has been more effective, less corrupt and better at positioning India on the world stage than past governments.
But his right-leaning political party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, also has alienated minorities and created fear. Intellectuals blame the Hindu nationalist atmosphere stoked by Mr. Modi and his party for a rash of lynchings and other violence against Muslims and lower caste Indians.
The latest surveys predict that Mr. Modi, 68, will return to power. But voter discontent over India's economic challenges, especially rising joblessness, is likely to reduce the number of parliamentary seats his party controls. That could hamper his ability to push the Hindu nationalist agenda further.
In the last election, in 2014, Mr. Modi's party stunned the country by winning an outright majority in the lower house of Parliament, which has 543 elected seats. By picking up even more seats through alliances with smaller parties, he then built a political juggernaut that went on to dominate Indian politics.
But this time around, few expect such a tidal wave. Though Mr. Modi remains popular among many in the middle class and across northern India's Hindu heartland, more poor Indians are turning against him.
Farmers in many states have organized protests, furious that Mr. Modi has not delivered on promises to strengthen crop prices. In urban areas, anti-Modi feelings are building as well. Rising inflation and unemployment have become liabilities for him.
India's economy is still growing at a fast rate, around 7 percent a year. Technology companies are popping up across the landscape; passenger jets are almost always packed; and more Indian students are attending the world's best universities. India now is the sixth-largest economy, powered by its sheer scale.
But many gains have been captured by a tiny elite. Poverty lurks in every corner of this country, from the busiest intersections of New Delhi, the capital, to the sharecropper cotton farms across India's bushy center.
This leaves the leading opposition party, the center-left Indian National Congress, an opportunity to capture more seats than in the last election, which it lost badly. But most polling data suggests the Congress party will be a distant second to Mr. Modi's, with slim prospects of forming the next government.
The biggest criticism of the Congress party, which won India freedom from Britain and ruled for most of India's independent history, is that it has failed to articulate a clear vision. The party historically has championed minority rights. Its socialist policies have helped improve education and empower lower castes.
But as Mr. Modi's party has pulled India rightward, the Congress party has struggled to respond.
Rasheed Kidwai, author of several books on the Congress party, said it lacked "that kind of hunger for power that the B.J.P. has."
The party also cannot shake its reputation as a family dynasty, embodied by its leader, Rahul Gandhi.
Mr. Gandhi's father was prime minister. So were his grandmother and great-grandfather.
But Mr. Gandhi, 48, has never displayed his ancestors' zest for politics. He is known as affable, mild-mannered, even a little shy, and if this race were purely a choice between him and Mr. Modi, opinion polls show he would be trounced.
But Indian politics are not personality pageants. The race for prime minister is actually 543 different parliamentary races, often driven by complex local issues and contested by a galaxy of parties that fight along geographic, religious and caste lines. Bribes are rampant; the election commission has already seized billions of rupees and millions of liters of liquor.
The election results will not be clear for a while, since the voting is conducted through mid-May. Different places vote on different dates, and the electronic machines -- and the poll workers -- will move from site to site.
Only after the last votes have been cast will the election commission reveal the results, expected on May 23.

Full text: UNITED NATIONS -- Vice President Mike Pence on Wednesday urged the United Nations to revoke the credentials of Venezuela's ambassador to the world body, portraying him as a loyalist to the country's disputed president, NicolÃ¡s Maduro, and to a government that has allowed crime, violence and starvation to rise.
In a 20-minute speech to the United Nations Security Council, Mr. Pence called for a formal recognition of Juan GuaidÃ³ as the rightful leader of Venezuela, which he called "a failed state -- and as history teaches, failed states know no boundaries."
Mr. Pence turned to the Venezuelan ambassador, Samuel Moncada Acosta, telling him, "You shouldn't be here."
"You should return to Venezuela and tell NicolÃ¡s Maduro that his time is up," Mr. Pence said. "It's time for him to go."
The Council meeting addressed the situation in Venezuela, which officials and experts are increasingly describing as a humanitarian crisis that has led about 3.5 million citizens to flee the country.
Instead of offering temporary asylum to Venezuelans, the Trump administration has called for Mr. Maduro's ouster to relieve a country rattled by skyrocketing inflation, widespread blackouts and a growing public health crisis. The United States, as a replacement, is forcefully supporting Mr. GuaidÃ³, the National Assembly politician whom the administration recognizes as the rightful interim president.
On Wednesday, Mr. Pence also accused China and Russia of meddling in efforts to remove Mr. Maduro. While "Russia and China continue to obstruct at the Security Council," Mr. Pence said, "rogue states like Iran and Cuba are doing all they can to prop up the Maduro regime."
Global rivalries have hindered the ability of the United Nations to address the crisis, despite intensifying warnings that the situation is deteriorating.
In February, the United States and Russia introduced dueling resolutions on Venezuela at the Security Council. The American proposal called for free and fair elections, and the Russian plan backed Mr. Maduro's government. Both failed.
Two weeks ago, President Trump warned Russia to "get out of" Venezuela after two of Moscow's military planes landed in Caracas, the Venezuelan capital, to unload supplies and military personnel. But Mr. Trump has done little else to publicly engage as the crisis continues.
That role has fallen to Mr. Pence. But on Wednesday, he did not give a firm answer when asked by a reporter where the United States would draw a line on Russia's involvement. He also did not give a timeline when asked if the possibility of American military intervention, an option long played up by administration officials, was drawing closer as conditions in Venezuela worsened.
Instead, the Trump administration has tried to choke off Mr. Maduro's economic resources. Last week, it announced a round of sanctions targeting oil shipments between Venezuela and Cuba, the latest in a string of initiatives meant to curb Caracas's ability to do business. Visas have been revoked in recent weeks for hundreds of Mr. Maduro's associates.
In briefings held before Mr. Pence arrived to speak, United Nations officials warned of a situation that has only grown more dire as unrest continues and said that offering relief to Venezuelan citizens should not be a political issue.
Mark Lowcock, an under secretary for humanitarian affairs, told the Security Council that a recent draft overview of the situation by the United Nations indicated that around 1.9 million people require nutritional assistance because of worsening food availability, including 1.3 million children under 5. Additionally, Mr. Lowcock said, tuberculosis, diphtheria, measles, malaria and other preventable diseases have resurfaced in Venezuela.
Food shortages also remain a main factor in driving people out of the country: Surveys show that 80 percent of Venezuelan households struggle with finding enough food, United Nations officials said.
"In Venezuela, there is a need to separate political and humanitarian objectives," Mr. Lowcock said. "Humanitarian assistance must be delivered on the basis of need alone."
The number of people expected to leave Venezuela may surpass five million by the year's end, said Eduardo Stein, a special United Nations envoy for Venezuelan refugees and migrants.
Citing a worsening public health crisis aggravated by constant blackouts, Kathleen Page, a doctor and professor at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, urged the Security Council to declare a humanitarian crisis formally and address it in a "neutral, independent and impartial" way.
On Tuesday, Mr. Maduro said he had met with members of the Red Cross to finalize plans for the arrival of aid to Venezuela. His government and the opposition reached a deal to organize a large-scale relief effort late last month.
"We reiterated our disposition to establish cooperation mechanisms for international aid and assistance," Mr. Maduro wrote Tuesday on Twitter.
The United States still does not have a permanent representative to the United Nations, a fact that reporters pointed out to Mr. Pence as he fielded questions over whether the Security Council would support his demand to revoke the Venezuelan ambassador's credentials.
Mr. Pence said he felt that "momentum is on the side of freedom."

Net Neutrality Vote Is Passed by House
The House passed legislation on Wednesday that would guarantee broadband internet users equal access to online content, in a crucial step toward bringing back socalled net neutrality regulations overturned at the start of the Trump administration. In a 232-to-190 vote, divided along party lines, the Democratic majority made good on a promise that became a rallying cry in many progressive circles during the 2018 election. It is also expected to be held up as an issue by Democrats in 2020. But the legislation, the Save the Internet Act, faces long odds in the Republican-led Senate. The Senate leader, Mitch McConnell, said this week that the legislation would be "dead on arrival." The Office of Management and Budget has advised the president to veto the law if it reached his desk. The legislation would prohibit blocking and throttling web traffic and would categorize broadband as a service open to heavy regulation. CECILIA KANG
MERGERS
Shareholders Blast Bayer Over Monsanto Deal
One of Bayer's largest shareholders tore into the company's management for underestimating the legal risks of its takeover of Monsanto, setting the stage for a fiery annual general meeting after a 30 percent plunge in the shares. Bayer has seen about 30 billion euros, or $34 billion, wiped off its market value since August, when a jury in the United States found Bayer liable because Monsanto had not warned of the suspected cancer risks associated with its weedkiller Roundup. "It's quite drastic when a takeover triggers such value destruction and reputational damage so quickly," said Ingo Speich, the head of sustainability and corporate governance at Deka Investment. "There can be no talk of a successful takeover any more." The major shareholder advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis last week recommended investors not to give the executive board their seal of approval at the annual general meeting this month.

ECONOMY
U.S. Consumer Prices Rose 0.4% in March
United States consumer prices increased by the most in more than a year in March, but underlying inflation remained benign against the backdrop of slowing domestic and global economic growth. The Labor Department said on Wednesday that its Consumer Price Index rose 0.4 percent after increases in the costs of food, gasoline and rents. That was the biggest advance since January 2018 and followed a 0.2 percent gain in February. In the 12 months through March, the C.P.I. increased 1.9 percent. The C.P.I. gained 1.5 percent in February, which was the smallest rise since September 2016. Economists had forecast the C.P.I. climbing 0.3 percent in March. Inflation has remained muted, with wage growth increasing moderately despite a tightening labor market. The tame inflation environment, together with slowing economic activity, support the Federal Reserve's decision last month to suspend its three-year campaign to raise interest rates. REUTERS

Economy in Tatters, Pakistan's Premier Calls for End to Armed Militias

Full text: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan -- His country nearly went to war with a neighboring enemy six and a half times its size. Militants lurk in religious schools and in the countryside.
And with inflation soaring and debt ballooning, his finance team is scrambling, desperate to secure a multibillion-dollar rescue package to avoid economic collapse.
But Imran Khan, Pakistan's prime minister, is apparently feeling confident about his first eight months in office -- so much so that he invited a group of foreign journalists for an informal, hourlong chat on Tuesday in Islamabad, the capital.
While he seemed subdued, with puffy circles under his eyes, Mr. Khan also sought to project resolve -- particularly about ridding Pakistan of the militants it once tolerated.
"We have decided, for the future of our country -- forget the outside pressure -- we will not allow armed militias to operate anymore," he said.
"The Pakistan Army created them," he said, referring to the 1980s when Pakistan and the United States backed Muslim insurgents in Afghanistan against Soviet forces.
But, he added, "there is no use for these groups anymore."
Mr. Khan, 66, sat in a brightly lit drawing room on a gold-painted chair. He wore a long white shalwar kameez with the sleeves crisply pressed and spoke about corruption, poverty and trying to make peace with the Taliban.
He reminisced about traveling the world as an international cricket star and expressed alarm about India's shift toward Hindu nationalism and the rising crimes against India's Muslims.
India used to be "a very open society," he said. "I never thought that I would see what is happening in India right now. Muslim-ness is being attacked."
In August, Mr. Khan took over as the elected leader of one of the world's most troubled countries. And he did with a shadow over him.
Many observers said that the election was deeply flawed and that Mr. Khan had been secretly helped by Pakistan's powerful military, which cleared a path for him by harassing and threatening his political opponents. In many ways, he was a curious choice.
Pakistan is a conservative Muslim nation, and Mr. Khan, by contrast, was once an international playboy and celebrity athlete. He befriended notables like Princess Diana in a high-flying life that could not be more different from the lives of most Pakistanis, though in recent years he has mellowed and turned more toward Islam.
In office, Mr. Khan has struggled to right the economy and get the security forces to more effectively crack down on militant groups that shelter in Pakistan.
Mr. Khan promised that this new crackdown would go far deeper than previous ones criticized as cosmetic. The government, for instance, plans to send 200,000 teachers to religious schools across the country to teach secular subjects like English and math. The intention, Mr. Khan's aides said, was to deradicalize students.
His government sees the stakes as high. An international watchdog group, the Paris-based Financial Action Task Force, is on the brink of blacklisting and sanctioning Pakistan. If that happened, Pakistan would face greater difficulties in obtaining the financial bailouts and loans it has sought.
"We can't afford to be blacklisted," he said on Tuesday.
But Mr. Khan has also won praise for his seemingly coolheaded and statesmanlike behavior during the recent crisis with India, which he helped de-escalate by releasing a captured Indian pilot and emphasizing peace. He seemed quite cognizant that the last thing Pakistan needed was a war.
On Feb. 26, around 3:30 a.m., Mr. Khan said he was awakened by a phone call. A top military official told him that Indian warplanes had just crossed the border and conducted airstrikes on Pakistani soil.
Pakistan and India have been bitter enemies since 1947 when Britain decolonized the Indian subcontinent and created two nations: the mostly Hindu India, and the mostly Muslim Pakistan. The two have warred several times.
This time, the spark was a suicide bombing in the disputed territory of Kashmir that killed dozens of Indian soldiers. India blamed Pakistan for supporting the militant group behind the attack and vowed revenge.
After learning that the Indian bombs had fallen into an empty ravine around Balakot (India said the bombs had struck a terrorist training camp), Mr. Khan said Pakistan opted for a measured response and bombed an empty area just across the Indian border.
"They hit our trees, so we thought we'd hit their stones," he said.
When asked whether he or the country's military establishment controls Pakistan, Mr. Khan said that they work closely. Independent analysts don't disagree, but many Pakistanis still see Mr. Khan as the army's puppet.
Even some of Mr. Khan's own ministers have said that they worry the relationship could sour if Mr. Khan, famous for self-confidence and unpredictability, crosses the army bosses.
But in this case, after Pakistani forces shot down an Indian fighter jet and captured the pilot, Mr. Khan and the military seemed to agree the best response was to release the pilot, which eased tensions.
"I've played down the whole thing," he said.
Now Mr. Khan is back to wrestling with the economy.
Pakistan has struggled for years with high unemployment, extremely low rates of tax collection, runaway corruption, and sluggish exports. The country's trade deficit had swelled to $33 billion when Mr. Khan took office in August.
He blames Pakistan's economic problems on his predecessors, especially the Sharif family, his political rivals.
"You can't have the ruling elite siphoning off money and taking it abroad," he said. "If you don't hold them accountable, the country has no future."
With barely enough foreign reserves to cover the country's monthly import bills, Mr. Khan's government knows it needs a large bailout from the International Monetary Fund, but those often come with painful austerity conditions. His finance team has been reluctant to turn to the I.M.F. but now promises that a deal will be announced in the coming weeks.
On the streets, discontent is rising. People grumble about rising prices. Mr. Khan's government is trying to slow down demand to keep the trade deficit from growing even bigger.
But his government's decisions to raise levies on fuel and collect more taxes from ordinary Pakistanis, even if necessary for the economy's long-term health, have made people even angrier. Economic growth is forecast to slow further, leading to even more joblessness.
Nonetheless, Mr. Khan said, "my first priority is to take 100 million people out of poverty."
Pakistani analysts say his priority is genuine but question how Mr. Khan can possibly pay for it.
"I've been pretty consistent of my criticism of the P.M. going back a long time," said Mosharraf Zaidi, a newspaper columnist. "One thing that I cannot criticize him for is the core purpose of his being in public life, which is compassion."
As far as India, Mr. Khan could not resist a few digs. He said that India's prime minister, Narendra Modi, had opted for airstrikes to please a domestic audience -- India begins holding elections on Thursday.
But he added that Mr. Modi's government might actually be the best possible option for settling the Kashmir conflict, because right-wing Hindus would support Mr. Modi in achieving it.
"We have more chance for peace," he said, and then added with a smile, "except for this glitch of India's election."

Full text: The Federal Reserve, along with Congress, failed to take sufficient steps to revive the economy after the 2008 financial crisis. One simple measure of the inadequacy of the government's response is that inflation has remained persistently below the 2 percent annual rate the Fed regards as optimal, a sign of an underachieving economy.
Some liberals have complained for years about the Fed's lack of urgency as millions of Americans struggled to find jobs, or lived without significant wage increases. Since President Trump's election in 2016, a growing number of Republicans have decided they, too, favor stronger economic growth. Mr. Trump himself has been particularly outspoken, loudly and repeatedly pressing the Fed to reduce borrowing costs.
Lately Mr. Trump has gone even further, declaring he plans to nominate two of his political supporters, Stephen Moore and Herman Cain, to the Fed's board of governors.
Mr. Moore and Mr. Cain are exceptionally unqualified to serve on the Fed's board. Both men argued for the Fed to reduce its economic stimulus campaign while Barack Obama was president and then began to insist the Fed should do more following Mr. Trump's election. Since the need for economic stimulus was greater during the Obama years, the positions taken by Mr. Moore and Mr. Cain demonstrate either a profound lack of understanding of monetary policy -- or a view that the Fed should serve the political needs of the Republican Party. Or perhaps both. It's little consolation that they seem unlikely to influence the 17 current members of the Fed's monetary policymaking committee. If they are confirmed, it would upend a longstanding bipartisan commitment to filling the Fed's board with highly qualified technocrats who seek to serve the nation's long-term economic interest.
But the Fed and its defenders must do more than try to bar the doors of its marble headquarters. The Fed's critics have a point. Congress has sheltered the central bank from political interference so it can make difficult decisions in the interest of the American people. The Fed needs to show it has learned from its disappointing performance over the last decade. It needs to articulate a plan to respond more effectively to the next downturn.
The core of the problem is the Fed's inflation target. Since the double-digit inflation rates of the late 1970s, the Fed has focused on maintaining slow and steady inflation. In 2012, it formalized an annual target of 2 percent. But the Fed has fallen short of that mark in six of the last seven years, and its top officials predict it will miss the target again in 2019.
After the 2008 crisis, the Fed repeatedly hesitated to provide larger doses of economic stimulus because it was concerned about overshooting the target. In plain English, the Fed allowed millions of Americans to remain unemployed or underpaid because it feared that prices would start rising more quickly. It is now clear the Fed miscalculated -- and caused a lot of pain.
Low inflation also is a problem in its own right. It may seem odd to seek higher prices, but economists generally agree that a little inflation is a good thing. It keeps the economy at a safe distance from the prospect of a general decline in prices, or deflation, which can limit economic activity as people wait for still lower prices. Inflation also gives the Fed more room to cut borrowing costs during economic downturns. And inflation eases economic adjustments by allowing companies to cut real wages without cutting nominal wages.
The Fed is a deliberate animal; it has always preferred to fail by not doing enough. But there are signs the Fed is aware of the need for change. Jerome Powell, the Fed's chairman, said in March that low inflation is "one of the major challenges of our time." The Fed is hosting a conference in Chicago in June to gather advice from outside experts.
Already there are a number of interesting ideas in circulation. Mr. Powell's immediate predecessors, Janet Yellen and Ben Bernanke, both have backed a proposal for the Fed to allow higher inflation after periods of low inflation -- in effect, replacing the Fed's 2 percent annual inflation target with the goal of hitting a 2 percent average over time.
Others would like the Fed to set a 4 percent inflation target, or to replace inflation targeting entirely. Under one alternative, nominal G.D.P. targeting, the Fed would aim for a steady rate of growth in the value of the nation's economic output -- a measure that includes the effects of inflation. During periods of slower growth in the inflation-adjusted value of that economic output, the Fed would seek to compensate by allowing higher inflation.
All of these are fancy ways of saying that the Fed should have kept interest rates lower for longer after the 2008 recession, to deliver a significantly stronger dose of economic stimulus, and that it should show a little less fear of inflation the next time the economy needs its help.
By choosing one of these methods, the Fed can begin to demonstrate that it has learned the lesson.

Full text: Stock indexes in the United States took a round trip Monday, erasing their early-morning losses to end the day close to where they started.
The S&P 500 eked out a small gain, enough to prolong its winning streak to eight days, its longest in a year and a half. But the Dow Jones industrial average ended lower after another big loss for Boeing.
Most stock movements were only modest, and the market was nearly evenly split between winners and losers as investors looked ahead to a busy week for markets with updates scheduled for corporate earnings, the United States economy and global trade.
The S&P 500 rose 3.03 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,895.77. It climbed to within 1.2 percent of its record, which was set in September, and had been down as much as 0.4 percent in morning trading.
The Dow slipped 83.97, or 0.3 percent, to 26,341.02, and the Nasdaq gained 15.19, or 0.2 percent, to 7,953.88.
Boeing was one of the biggest movers on the quiet Monday, slumping 4.4 percent after saying late Friday it would cut production of its 737 Max plane. Regulators around the world grounded the jet model after it was involved in two separate fatal crashes that occurred within weeks of each other.
On the winning side were energy stocks, which benefited from yet another climb for the price of oil.
Since hitting a bottom below $43 per barrel in December, benchmark United States crude has gained more than $20. It rose $1.32 to settle at $64.40 per barrel Monday.
The gains helped send energy stocks in the S&P 500 index 0.5 percent higher, the biggest gain among the 11 sectors that make up the index.
The market's trend has been decidedly upward in recent weeks as stocks have grinded higher. It follows a torrid start to the year, after the Federal Reserve eased fears about a recession by saying it may not raise interest rates at all in 2019.
Later this week, investors will get more clues about the Fed's intentions. The central bank will release the minutes from its last policy meeting on Wednesday, and a report on consumer prices the same day will show whether inflation remains modest, which would give the Fed more leeway to keep interest rates low.
Earnings reporting season will begin in earnest at the end of this week, with JPMorgan Chase and other big banks set to tell investors how much they earned during the first three months of the year. Expectations are low for the market broadly, and analysts are forecasting the first drop in S&P 500 profits in years.
That puts more focus on what companies say about their profit prospects for the rest of the year. Analysts are expecting profit growth to resume after the weak first quarter, and if corporate chiefs undercut those beliefs, it would put downward pressure on stock prices.
"We're watching the earnings and the drivers of earnings," said Doug Ramsey, chief investment officer of Leuthold Group. He is paying particular attention to how much in profit companies are able to hold onto from each $1 in revenue, as wages and interest expenses on their debts rise.
Investors are also watching across the Atlantic, as the British prime minister prepares to meet continental European leaders ahead of a Friday deadline, when the United Kingdom is scheduled to depart the European Union.
All this comes against a backdrop of worries about global economic growth and a global trade war. Growth has slowed, and investors are debating how much last week's stronger-than-expected report on jobs in the United States changes the picture.
The dollar slipped to 111.53 Japanese yen from 111.71 yen late Friday. The euro rose to $1.1261 from $1.1218, and the British pound climbed to $1.3066 from $1.3029.
Gold rose $6.70 to $1,297.10 per ounce.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury note ticked up to 2.52 percent from 2.50 percent late Friday.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Hopes Raised During Arab Spring Are Being Revived Across North Africa

Full text: In Sudan, tens of thousands of demonstrators are sitting in to demand the ouster of their longtime ruler.
In Algeria, millions of protesters forced out their own octogenarian leader last week.
And in Libya, an aging general is battling to establish himself as a new strongman, promising to end the chaos that kicked off when Libyans threw out their own dictator eight years ago.
The hopes inspired by the Arab Spring uprisings of 2011 soured long ago. But across North Africa, the reverberations are coursing through the region once again, shaking autocratic governments and posing new questions about the future.
Veterans of the Arab Spring struggles say the scenes feel like flashbacks to chapters of a common story. The masses now clamoring for the removal of President Omar Hassan al-Bashir of Sudan evoke the crowds that gathered in Tahrir Square in Cairo or outside the Tunisian interior ministry eight years ago.
But the setbacks and disillusionment are familiar as well. Algerian generals may have forced an end to President Abdelaziz Bouteflika's 20-year rule to placate the crowds, but Algerians are now confronting the difficulty of challenging the entrenched system of cronyism and corruption that governed from behind him.
And a general's attempt to end the chaos in Libya by instituting a new autocracy recalls the unhappy outcomes of the uprisings in Egypt, Bahrain, Syria and Yemen.
"History repeats itself," Islam Lotfy, a leader of the Egyptian uprising of 2011 who is now living in forced exile in London, said ruefully. "It's dÃ©jÃ  vu for us."
Most of all, the new outbreak of unrest across North Africa is a reminder that the meaning of the history of the Arab Spring remains bitterly contested.
While authoritarian governments around the region have sought to drive home the moral that popular revolutions lead only to bedlam, the young people of Algeria and Sudan have evidently learned a different lesson: that nonviolent protests in big enough numbers can oust even the most deeply entrenched dictator.
"It is a lesson of the history of 2011, and of all revolutions for all times," Amjed Farid, a Sudanese activist and intellectual, said in a telephone interview.
The renewed unrest across North Africa has also underscored the idea that the fundamental problems that exploded into the earlier uprisings have continue to fester, including soaring populations of disaffected young people, closed and corrupt economies unable to absorb job seekers and authoritarian governments unresponsive to the public.
With President Trump expected to play host to President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt at the White House on Tuesday, some scholars say the new upheaval is a warning of the risks of embracing such autocratic allies too closely.
Mr. el-Sisi, 64, came to power in a military takeover that shut down Egypt's experiment with democracy in 2013. Now he is coming to Washington to seek at least a tacit blessing ahead of a referendum to change the Egyptian constitution so that he can stay in power until 2034 -- in effect, as president for life.
At the same time, Mr. el-Sisi has also indicated that he intends to sharply reduce energy subsidies in the summer, steps that have set off unrest in Egypt before and now come at a time of high unemployment and raging inflation.
Philip Gordon, a former White House coordinator for the Middle East and North Africa under President Obama, argued that the upheaval in countries like Algeria and Sudan underscored that dictators like Mr. el-Sisi cannot be relied on for durable stability.
"If a regime is not able to be more responsive to its citizens, eventually they will rise up again," he said.
"Repression alone cannot save you forever," he added. "You have to treat your people better."
Activists in Sudan and Algeria -- and partisans on both sides of the battle in Libya -- all say they are fighting to escape the fates of the Arab states that rose up in 2011. All of those countries, except for Tunisia, have either plunged into chaos or reverted to authoritarianism.
Now, organizers in Sudan and Algeria say that military leaders in both countries are already adopting the tactics of their counterparts in Egypt.
In Sudan, security forces have killed dozens of protesters, and perhaps more, since street demonstrations began in December. In response, Sudanese doctors had been boycotting military hospitals to protest the army's support for Mr. Bashir and the brutal tactics he has used to try to crush the demonstrations, said Mr. Farid, the activist, who is also a member of the executive committee of the doctors' association.
But as the largest crowds in months of demonstrations gathered outside the presidential palace in recent days, soldiers began protecting them from attacks by the police or militias loyal to Mr. Bashir.
Now, the doctors' association is dropping its boycott of military hospitals, Mr. Farid said.
"The army strongly protected them, and it is really amazing how they are doing it, but the army is gaining popularity among the common people," he said.
He said the military's tactic reminded him uncomfortably of the experience in Egypt, where the generals who forced out President Hosni Mubarak won popularity as the guardians of a revolution -- but ultimately co-opted and then crushed it.
"That is the risk we are facing," he said, though he argued that Sudan's history of revolutions and coups had better prepared its opposition parties for negotiations with the military.
In Egypt in 2011, Islamists worried openly about how to avoid what they called "the Algeria scenario."
Twenty years earlier, Algerian generals had canceled a parliamentary election to prevent an Islamist victory at the polls. For the next 10 years, the Algerian army and the Islamists fought a civil war that killed more than 100,000 people.
Even despite the Egyptians' efforts to study that lesson, their uprising followed a similar path. Islamists won control of the Parliament and the presidency in Egypt's first free elections. But the generals dissolved Parliament and deposed the elected president, and six years later the military is still struggling to defeat a militant Islamist backlash.
Now Algerians talk openly about avoiding the Egyptian scenario.
The Algerian military's chief of staff last week announced the removal of Mr. Bouteflika with the same flourishes that an Egyptian officer used in 2011 at the removal of Mr. Mubarak. Raising a hand in a salute to the people, he pledged to support their "legitimate demands."
But the interim government named by Mr. Bouteflika is made up of his allies and loyalists, including a hard-line prime minister accused of rigging elections. So instead of rejoicing at the ouster of their autocrat, as the Egyptian protesters did, Algerian demonstrators have continued to demand a more sweeping end of what they dismissively call the "system."
In Libya, the general now vying to capture Tripoli, the capital, has long modeled himself after Mr. el-Sisi of Egypt.
The Libyan general, Khalifa Hifter, first announced his plan to take power in a speech in 2014 that borrowed heavily from one made several months earlier by Mr. el-Sisi, who was then a general.
Invoking a nonexistent Libyan Supreme Council of the Armed Forces in apparent mimicry of Egypt's council, General Hifter promised a transitional "road map," just as General el-Sisi had done.
Supporters hail General Hifter, 75, as the only one who can rescue Libya from the chaos that has followed the revolts in Syria and Yemen, just as they say Mr. el-Sisi saved Egypt.
General Hifter's opponents, in turn, bash him as a tyrant in thrall of Mr. el-Sisi, and say he aspires to be a strongman like the nation's former dictator, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi.
Stalled for a fourth day in his drive to conquer Tripoli, General Hifter's forces on Monday retreated on several fronts around the outskirts of the city. Perhaps in desperation, his small air force also resorted to bombing the last remaining airport available for civilians, threatening to severely isolate the city.
Ghassan Salame, the United Nations special representative for Libya, condemned the bombing as "a serious violation of international humanitarian law."
"The United Nations is deeply concerned for the welfare of the civilian population in the ongoing violence, and of the implications of the attack on the airport," Mr. Salame said in a statement.
The turmoil in so many neighbors appears to have stirred some anxieties around Mr. el-Sisi. While the Egyptian media has lauded General Hifter's advance, it has largely overlooked the uprisings in Algeria and Sudan, which have dominated headlines elsewhere in the region.
"That is a good indication of how worried they are," said Khaled Dawoud, an Egyptian journalist who participated in the Arab Spring uprising and for a time became the president of a liberal political party.
Some Egyptians, he said, still take pride in setting the template for the nonviolent uprisings now flaring in Algeria and Sudan.
"The power of the people has proved to be alive, and the desire to have a president who does not stay for life," Mr. Dawoud said. "The model we set in 2011 remains alive despite the tremendous efforts to crush and distort it."

Full text: As far as I know, the Federal Reserve -- the world's most important economic policy institution -- doesn't have an anthem. But if it were to adopt one now, the choice would be obvious: "Send In the Clowns."
You see, the Fed's governing board currently has two vacancies, and Donald Trump has proposed filling those vacancies with ludicrous hacks. If he succeeds, one of our few remaining havens of serious, nonpartisan policymaking will be on its way toward becoming as corrupt and dysfunctional as the rest of the Trump administration.
Stephen Moore and Herman Cain are, of course, completely unqualified -- I say "of course" because their lack of qualifications is, paradoxically, a key qualification not just for Trump but for the G.O.P. in general.
There are plenty of genuine monetary experts with conservative political leanings, some of them quite partisan. But modern Republicans have shown consistent disdain for such experts, perhaps because of a sense that anyone with real expertise or an independent reputation might occasionally be tempted to take a stand on principle.
[For an even deeper look at what's on Paul Krugman's mind, sign up for his weekly newsletter.]
There's no risk that either Moore or Cain will ever take such a stand. In fact, what seems to have recommended both men to Trump was their evident willingness to completely reverse their policy views when politically expedient.
Both were hard-money men during the Obama years, demanding higher interest rates despite very high unemployment. Both have now taken to berating the Fed for failing to print more money in the face of low unemployment -- because that's what Trump wants.
That said, there's a difference between the two men.
I wrote about Moore a couple of weeks ago, noting that he has long been a prominent fixture in the conservative movement; he is, basically, a classic right-wing hack who tries (incompetently) to impersonate an economic expert. Cain, on the other hand, is a spam king whose business model involves making his email list available to direct marketers.
Put it this way: In recent years Moore has been out there predicting magical results from tax cuts, putting out fake economic numbers, and giving speeches to FreedomFest. At the same time, Cain has been offering a platform for peddlers of get-rich schemes and cures for erectile dysfunction. So it says something about what Trump wants that he apparently sees the two men as equally valuable allies.
What does Trump want? His attempted beclowning of the Fed follows, I'd argue, from the fact that his one major legislative success, the 2017 tax cut -- which he predicted would be "rocket fuel" for the economy -- has turned out to be a big fizzle, economically and, especially, politically.
It's true that U.S. economic growth got a bump for two quarters last year, and Trumpists are still pretending to believe that we'll have great growth for a decade. But at this point last year's growth is looking like a brief and rapidly fading sugar high.
Meanwhile, the tax cut remains unpopular, partly because few people perceived personal benefits, partly because voters appear to be less concerned about paying too much than with the sense that the rich -- the prime beneficiaries of the Trump cut -- are paying too little.
Some leaders might see such disappointments as reasons to make a course correction. But this is Trump: When the going gets tough, he blames someone else. Everything would have been great, he insists, if the Fed hadn't thwarted his plans.
There's a good argument to be made that the Fed misjudged the economy's strength, that it raised interest rates too fast and that the economy would be doing somewhat better if it hadn't. In fact, it's an argument I agree with.
But that's not what Trump is saying. He wants the Fed to act as if we were still in a deep depression; he wants it both to cut rates and to resume the emergency policies it pursued -- and he denounced -- when we had more than twice as much unemployment as we do today. This would, he insists, turn the economy into the "rocket ship" he originally promised.
You don't have to be a gold bug or even an inflation hawk to see these demands as deeply irresponsible. Indeed, they sound a lot like the "macroeconomic populism" that has repeatedly led to economic disaster in Latin America, with Venezuela the latest example.
Running the printing presses to fight a depression, as the Fed did after the financial crisis, is prudent and sensible; running them because you refuse to accept the reality that your policies aren't delivering an economic miracle is different, and always ends badly.
Now, even putting both Moore and Cain on the Fed board probably wouldn't be enough to push America over the monetary edge. And so far, markets don't seem worried about the potential for runaway inflation.
But maybe investors should be worried, at least a bit, by the spectacle of a president who would rather appoint hacks and debase the Fed's integrity than admit that his policies aren't working as promised. U.S. policymaking is looking ever more like that of a corrupt third-world regime. And that is bound, sooner or later, to have consequences.

Full text: Politicians have had strong opinions on what the Federal Reserve should and shouldn't do throughout its 105-year history.
They have pushed for lower interest rates and easier money, or for this or that policy on bank regulation or consumer protection. They have summoned Fed leaders to the White House or Congress to persuade and cajole.
In that sense, there is nothing new in President Trump's aggressive approach to the Fed. This week, he called for lower interest rates and new quantitative easing, and he signaled an intention to appoint two vocal supporters, Stephen Moore and Herman Cain, to the board of governors.
What makes Mr. Trump's approach to the Fed so unusual is that he has repeatedly, publicly undermined a Fed chief he appointed (Jerome Powell), and, if successful, he would put two officials with a background in partisan politics in the inner sanctum of Fed policymaking. (Mr. Moore was founder of the Club for Growth, which supports conservative candidates for office, and Mr. Cain ran for president.)
"It's more overtly political than anything we've seen since at least the '80s, and historically when we've had political appointments and interventions in the Fed, there have been unintended consequences that last," said Julia Coronado, president of MacroPolicy Perspectives and a former Fed staffer. "It may be expedient in the near term, but what's good for the next year or two may not be good for the next decade."
All presidential appointees to the Fed's board of governors come with their own political point of view, which generally dovetails with the president who appointed them. But typically they have also brought deep technical expertise and an inclination to keep political dimensions out of Fed debates.
"People around the table did have political views, and I did, too," said Alan Blinder, who was appointed vice chairman of the Fed by President Bill Clinton and is more recently the author of "Advice and Dissent," about the role of politicians versus technocrats in shaping policy. "But you weren't supposed to bring them into the room when it was time to make a decision, and people didn't."
That is the tradition that Mr. Trump's approach endangers.
You can read thousands of pages of transcripts of closed-door Fed policy meetings without seeing a reference to the political jockeying that occupies the rest of Washington.
Three times in recent decades, a president has reappointed a Fed chairman first named by a president of the opposite party (Ronald Reagan with Paul Volcker, Mr. Clinton with Alan Greenspan and Barack Obama with Ben Bernanke).
You will see no political bumper stickers in the underground parking garage. When Dan Tarullo, an Obama campaign veteran and a banking expert, was named a governor in 2009, there was some tut-tutting among staff that he initially left his sticker on.
In effect, the risk is that the Fed becomes yet another partisan battlefield, as is already often the case with the Supreme Court nomination process, congressional intelligence oversight committees and regulators like the Federal Communications Commission.
In the immediate future, this probably wouldn't mean much for policy. If nominated and confirmed, Mr. Moore and Mr. Cain would hold two of 12 votes on the Federal Open Market Committee. Their ability to sway the Fed toward Mr. Trump's desired interest rate cuts and a new round of quantitative easing would depend on their ability to persuade their new colleagues.
"It will be their task to convince the others that their way of thinking about monetary policy will improve the Fed's ability to meet its legislative mandates for maximum employment and stable prices," said Don Kohn, a former Fed vice chairman who was appointed by George W. Bush. "That will require solid economic analysis backed up by research."
The risk of more overt political divisions within the Fed would come over time, if the Fed came to be seen as basing decisions on the political impulses of appointees rather than on sound economic analysis.
The United States' role as the global reserve currency -- which results in persistently low interest rates and little fear of capital flight -- is built in significant part on the credibility the Fed has accumulated over decades.
During the global financial crisis and its aftermath, for example, the Fed could feel comfortable pursuing efforts to stimulate the United States economy without a loss of faith in the dollar and Treasury bonds by global investors. The dollar actually rose against other currencies even as the economy was in free fall in late 2008, and the Fed deployed trillions of dollars in unconventional programs to try to stop the crisis.
The hazards of a more politicized Fed are evident from the experience of the early 1970s, when Richard Nixon used both political pressure and underhanded tactics to try to push the Fed chairman, Arthur Burns, to keep interest rates low heading into the 1972 election.
Among other things, the White House leaked a false story that Mr. Burns sought a large pay raise at a time the Fed was pressuring employers not to increase wages to fight inflation.
Mr. Burns and the Fed followed the president's wishes, and Mr. Nixon won re-election handily in 1972, amid a booming economy. But it was in those years that inflationary pressures were building in the economy, and within a few years the rate of inflation reached double digits.
No one would argue that the Fed is divorced from politics. It is constantly making decisions that pit the interests of workers against owners of capital, and those of banks against those of consumers. But there is a difference between acknowledging that there are choices that must be informed by political values and putting those political values ahead of what are often highly technical discussions.
In Senate confirmation hearings, would Mr. Moore and Mr. Cain adopt the cautious, careful language typical of central bankers -- or embrace a role as partisan warriors?
The safest bet is that investors around the world will be watching carefully for hints of just how politicized the Fed of the future will turn out to be.

Full text: SYDNEY -- One Saturday in March, in the suburbs north of Sydney, around three dozen people gathered on a lawn outside a smallish two-bedroom apartment.
They were taking part in an idiosyncrasy of the Australian economic system. Here, selling a home tends to be an almost festive gathering, in which potential buyers show up for an auction and neighbors stop by to watch the spectacle -- and quietly calibrate how much their own homes might be worth.
On this muggy day, almost all of the assembled crowd turned out to be gawkers; only four people actually raised their bidding paddles at any point. After bidding opened at 750,000 Australian dollars (about $532,000 in the U.S.), the action started slowly. Twice, it seemed to be petering out as the auctioneer, Andrew Robinson, nearly banged his final gavel, only to be extended with one more bid. Finally a young couple whose agent lobbed in a 930,000 Australian dollar ($661,000) offer won the day.
It reflected a wheezing Australian housing market. Prices have fallen since the country's banks tightened lending standards in mid-2018 and the Chinese government made it harder for its citizens to buy property abroad. Not too long ago, the number of interested parties might have been double.
"Twelve to 18 months ago, it would have sold for 1.1 million," said Mr. Robinson, with Belle Property, as he packed up his gavel and papers and prepared to head to his next auction on a day he would conduct eight of them. "There was more of a frenzied atmosphere, more people bidding who just didn't want to lose out."
I had flown 16,000 miles not to study economic malaise, but its opposite: the remarkable resilience of the Australian economy, which has gone nearly 28 years without a recession. The government, with elections to take place next month, recently announced an expected surplus in the next budget year.
Surely this grand economic success story would hold lessons for the United States and the rest of the world, right?
Yet instead of giddy enthusiasm, what I found in Sydney was a pervasive sense of caution and wariness -- and not just involving real estate, though housing does loom large in discussions about the economy. In conversations with Australian businesspeople and college students, economists and government officials, I detected no sense of triumphalism.
An entire generation of young adults has grown up without experiencing a protracted downturn. But in Australia, as I came to learn, nobody really acts as if they're the stars of an unprecedented three-decade success story. They're aware that the good times could end. The mood is more practicality than pessimism.
America is on the verge of its own economic milestone: The current expansion is on track to reach its 10th birthday this summer, which would also put it on record as the nation's longest streak without a recession.
During the decade I've spent chronicling that growth as an economics writer, a persistent whisper has been: How long can it go? The run has been uneven, underwhelming and repeatedly on the verge of unraveling, including scary moments in 2010, 2015 and this past December. Seemingly every commentator without a good clichÃ© blocker has referred to it as "long in the tooth."
Even the language of economics suggests that an end to the good times is inevitable. If you're going to call it the "business cycle," things can't just keep getting better forever. Some of history's great economic thinkers have theorized that downturns are as essential to the workings of the economy as the seasons are to agriculture.
Is Australia a unique case, a beneficiary of some good economic luck that cannot be replicated in the rest of the world? Or is the nation onto something, and are there lessons in economic policy that are applicable everywhere?
When I landed there in mid-March, in the waning days of the Australian summer, that's what I hoped to figure out.
Good luck and good policy
Ask Australian economists about this golden run, and almost all will say it has been driven partly by good luck and partly by good policy.
The luck part can't be minimized. Beneath the ground of large stretches of Australia are the iron ore and coal that have been the raw materials behind China's long economic boom. Above ground lies the wheat and cattle that have helped feed China's rapidly growing middle-class population.
China's growth, in other words, has created a tailwind that has boosted Australia's economy for much of this period. And if the Chinese economy ever truly tanks, even the most skilled policymakers in Australian will have a hard time preventing a recession.
But China's gravitational pull can explain only so much. For one thing, other countries nearby have had recessions, some severe, in recent decades. And there are a long list of policy choices that enabled the long Australian boom even as otherwise similar economies sank.
One episode is particularly telling. In 1997, an East Asian financial crisis walloped the economies of countries like South Korea, Thailand and Indonesia. These nations were major buyers of Australian exports. The value of the Australian dollar started to fall on global currency markets, putting the expansion at risk only six years in.
On the other side of the Tasman Sea, New Zealand's central bank responded to the same problem by raising interest rates. After all, a falling New Zealand dollar indicated a lack of confidence in the currency and implied that inflation would soon rise.
At the Reserve Bank of Australia, by contrast, officials concluded that the falling value of the Australian dollar reflected shifting economic fundamentals that were ultimately healthy -- part of how the Australian economy could adapt to faltering demand from East Asia.
Rather than raise interest rates to try to prevent a falling currency, they viewed a falling currency as the key to navigating the peril -- by making Australian exports more competitive in the United States and Europe, for example.
"The government was uncomfortable if the exchange rate went too low, because it looked like a sign of no confidence," said Malcolm Edey, who was the central bank's head of economic research at the time. "We had a good monetary framework in place, we stuck to it, and we didn't panic when the exchange rate moved around along the way."
Sure enough, New Zealand fell into recession in 1997 and 1998, while Australia endured only a period of subpar growth. Good policy, it turns out, has a way of creating good luck. And it wasn't the only time.
Boring banking and avoiding the global financial crisis
If you had looked around the world circa 2006, you would have seen a number of countries where housing prices had soared into potential bubble territory, including the United States, Britain and Australia.
But two years later, while the United States and Britain were in a severe recession and financial crisis, Australia experienced only a single quarter of contraction. Why the difference?
The answer seems to be how the financial industries of those countries were structured and regulated. To understand that better, I sought out a tutor, one who turned out to have an unlikely background: David Morgan, a former child actor and professional Australian Rules Football player who later became one of the country's leading bankers.
After a wave of deregulation in the 1980s, Australian banks took on ever-more-risky lending, especially for commercial real estate, and got into new business lines overseas in which they had no obvious competitive advantage. When that asset bubble popped and a recession arrived, the banks came near failure, and there was a wholesale firing of top bank executives.
It was a matter of "going through the furnace, and coming out tempered by experience," said Mr. Morgan, who was chief executive of Westpac, one of Australia's major banks, during the crisis. "We were adamant that we would go into the next shock with the least risk and the most resilience, and would not engage in any more offshore frolics."
The banks -- with prodding from regulators -- reformulated themselves to take a more conservative and domestically focused approach to lending. After that near-death experience, there remained the "Big Four" banks that together control about 80 percent of deposits; they are not allowed to merge with each other.
The banks also did not engage in the kind of expansionist strategy that had gotten them in trouble in 1991. They did not open huge offices in Hong Kong, London or New York, nor get in the business of creating the complex mortgage securities that were the nexus of the financial crisis.
Good regulation was part of it. "They were good quality regulators; the public sector was getting good people," Mr. Morgan said. Both major political parties have tended to be tough on banks, and there is a single powerful regulator rather than a patchwork of them as in the United States.
But just as important was the sense among bank leaders that they would need to be ready when the next downturn came.
It's not as if Australia's banks are perfect actors. A royal commission established to examine the industry found widespread misconduct, including abuses of customers, in a report issued this year.
But they have focused on lending to Australians, especially for home mortgages, and held those loans on their own books. No doubt Australia has missed out on some opportunities by not hosting the big, complicated banks that operate worldwide and do more sophisticated forms of finance. Sydney does not have the concentration of high-paying finance jobs that London and Hong Kong do.
But having a conservative, domestically focused, highly concentrated banking system meant that Australia wasn't stuck importing other countries' financial contagions when crises hit.
During the global financial crisis, Australia suffered from plummeting demand for its products. But a nicely designed fiscal stimulus -- combined with a falling Australian dollar and an assist from aggressive stimulus by China -- helped the country regain its footing rapidly and avoid the mass economic pain found in so much of the world.
The pessimism of 2019
If there's anyone you would expect to be bullish, it might be the young adults entering the work force, who have never lived through a recession. But among them -- as with other Australians who don't occupy the halls of government or financial power -- you find angst and uncertainty rather than boom-time optimism.
"I think there will be a recession within the next 10 years," said George Ye, 25, who is studying for a master's degree in data science at the University of Sydney. "I feel like sentiment is, we might have gotten to a peak. Things have gone so well for so long that the things we need to buy are getting more and more expensive," especially housing. "I think the generation of people born 10 years prior to me are much more confident than I am."
"I'm pessimistic," said Freya Zemek, 24, an employee at the university. "I think we're probably looking at a recession in 2020. Consumer confidence isn't very high. The signs aren't looking great, and I think it's the sort of tightrope situation where we could be next for a recession. It's only a matter of time. Nothing goes on forever."
Housing especially seems to be in the opposite of a sweet spot. It's still too expensive, especially in booming Sydney and Melbourne, for young people. Yet the prices are well below those from a couple of years ago, leaving recent buyers sitting on paper losses.
But just maybe, the contrast between a pessimistic mood and a long record of economic success isn't as contradictory as it may seem.
Are recessions really necessary?
In November 1990, the Australian treasurer (and later prime minister) Paul Keating described a painful downturn then underway as "the recession we had to have."
His point was that excesses in a lending and credit boom, combined with high inflation, meant that the Australian economy needed the wrenching experience of a downturn to rid itself of those excesses. It was also a horrible political gaffe, a comment that went over poorly in a country then burdened with an 11 percent unemployment rate.
But the question of whether he was right is profound -- one that economists can still debate.
The great economic thinker Joseph Schumpeter argued that recessions served an essential purging mechanism enabling a society to become richer over time. Through business failures, capital is redeployed to emerging high-growth industries. In this thinking, recessions play a cleansing effect, clearing the way for the future.
Hyman Minsky, another 20th-century economist, argued that long periods of financial stability could breed complacency: The longer a nation goes without a downturn, the more risky behavior will build up in the economy, making the eventual downturn worse.
Those theories sound plausible. Data to support the case is a little harder to find. In fact, there is some evidence that recessions actually cause lasting damage to a country's economic potential -- that they hurt, rather than help -- by thrusting people out of the work force unnecessarily and causing their skills to atrophy. Research shows that people who enter the work force during a recession take a hit to their earnings even decades later.
There have also been long periods when the Minskyite story has seemed not to apply, notably in the decades after World War II in the United States.
"I think Australia's experience shows that you don't need recessions to clean out the system, but it does show that what you need is strong, clear policy settings from governments," said James Pearson, the chief executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. "There is a risk, and I think we're seeing it in Australia today, that a prolonged period of economic growth without recession can lead to complacency both among policymakers and the electorate."
But that brings us back to the slowing housing market, and the general sense of pessimism that sneaks into conversations about the economy in Australia, especially among the young.
Maybe the real reason Australia has made it so long without a downturn is an absence of complacency. No one is brimming with overconfidence that all is well and always will be.
"What has happened in the last 27 years is a series of shocks, each of which, thanks to policy and luck, we were able to overcome," said Stephen Grenville, the former deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia and now a fellow at the Lowy Institute. "That's the nature of the economy we're in now -- an economy with shocks plus flexibility."
It isn't the absence of bad stuff happening in the economy that has kept Australia growing for so long. It is the nation's economic flexibility and policymakers' rejection of complacency.
So maybe the pessimism isn't a paradox at all. And maybe we would be more worried about Australia's economic future if house prices had kept soaring toward unsustainable highs, or if young people had made economic decisions with a sense of reckless invincibility and engaged in borrowing and spending behaviors accordingly.
The Australian experience is evidence that the "business cycle" is a misleading way to think about economic growth. Recessions aren't like thunderstorms, an inevitable, random event that may be violent but provide much-needed water to crops.
Maybe recessions are more like car crashes. They may never be completely eliminated, but making the right choices can make them rarer and less damaging when they do happen.
In trying to learn the lessons of Australia, that may be the biggest of them all. There will always be bad things that happen in an economy. The best way to keep them from causing the mass pain that accompanies a recession is to combine sound policy, a flexible and dynamic economy and -- perhaps most important -- just the right amount of fear.

Full text: The package of eccentric ideas known as modern monetary theory -- for example, that annual deficits are too small, and that the United States can essentially print money to pay off its debt -- has been on the receiving end of a remarkable level of vitriol.
In policy circles, heavyweight economists have churned out scathing attacks. In the business arena, titans like Laurence D. Fink and Bill Gates have labeled it "garbage" and "crazy talk." And in academia, when the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business asked top scholars about a couple of its claims, they split between the 28 percent who disagreed and the 72 percent who strongly disagreed.
But M.M.T., as it's known, is attracting a conspicuous number of fans in an unexpected place: Wall Street. Money managers, chief executives and business analysts maintain that the approach offers several important and overlooked insights, and far from finding it fanciful or deranged, they are using M.M.T. to build economic forecasts and even trading strategies.
"I don't look at labels in terms of what's on the left and the right," said Jan Hatzius, the chief economist at Goldman Sachs. "I try to look at what makes me have a better chance of getting the forecast right, and I do find some of the ideas useful."
So does Paul A. McCulley, a former chief economist at the behemoth asset firm Pimco. Ideas like M.M.T. that rub against the grain of conventional economics, he said, have "for all of my career been a very useful framework for analysis."
That framework helped produce billion-dollar gains for the company after the 2008 financial crisis. Dismissing alarms about outsize government debt and white-knuckle interest rates, Pimco instead bet successfully that rates would remain low. When it came to decision-making during this period, Mr. McCulley said, M.M.T. and other unorthodox approaches helped him "get it right."
Richard C. Koo, chief economist at the Nomura Research Institute in Tokyo, said he had been telling his clients for years that "even with huge budget deficits in the U.S., interest rates would actually come down, not go up."
Wall Street is not immune to the herd mentality, but Mr. Koo and several other analysts argued that academic economists had a vested interest in certain theories and were, therefore, more likely to suffer from groupthink.
In an article posted on Wednesday on the website of Grantham, Mayo, Van Otterloo & Company, known as GMO, the strategist James Montier wrote: "For me an economic approach must help me understand the world, and provide me with some useful insights (preferably about my day job -- investing). On those measures, let me assure you that M.M.T. thrashes neoclassical economics, hands down."
And Daniel Alpert, a managing partner of the investment bank Westwood Capital, credited the theory with preventing him from panicking that rates would soar when the Federal Reserve set off a brief "taper tantrum" in 2013 and announced it was easing its stimulus program.
Over the past couple of years, he said, the Fed tried everything -- "it did a belly dance to get long-term interest rates up" -- and it didn't work.
M.M.T., Mr. Alpert said, "successfully debunks 40 years of misassumptions of how markets and public credit work."
Explaining M.M.T.'s Appeal
Progressive politicians like Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York are among the most vocal supporters of M.M.T., but the theory's appeal crosses political lines in part because it offers a narrative for a series of events that the established wisdom failed to anticipate or explain.
Big government deficits, for instance, were supposed to mop up available pools of capital and drive up interest rates, which would, in turn, elbow out private investors, damage growth and feed inflation.
But the last decade was different. When deficits soared after the recession, interest rates fell and savings rates climbed. Investors are awash in capital. The economy has been expanding, slowly, for 10 years, with unemployment and inflation rates ensconced at record-low levels.
One reason for the misjudgments may be that the economic models that confidently strode down the mainstream were hammered out in the decades after World War II, when American companies had an enormous appetite for capital investment. "We don't live in that world anymore," said Mr. Koo of Nomura. Today, vast fortunes shift across oceans in an instant, currencies are untethered from gold, and your local coffee shop may no longer accept cash.
Technological advances, demographic shifts and persistently lower interest rates have further altered the global economy. Mohamed A. El-Erian, chief economic adviser at the financial firm Allianz, wrote in an email that "modern monetary theory has merit in stimulating debate" on whether those changes provide "for governments to run larger economically sustainable deficits than was previously thought possible."
Besides the risk of government deficits, M.M.T. throws out a drawerful of other venerable assumptions with Marie Kondo-esque ruthlessness. To start, it instructs you to erase that textbook drawing of a white-haired Uncle Sam collecting tax dollars from the public and then using them to pay for military weapons, highway repairs, federal workers' wages and more.
Tax revenues are not what finance the government's expenditures, argues Stephanie Kelton, an economist at Stony Brook University and one of the most influential modern monetary theorists. What actually happens in a country that controls its own currency, she says, is that the government first decides what it's going to spend. In the United States, Congress agrees on a budget. Then government agencies start handing out dollars to the public to pay for those tanks, earth movers and salaries. Afterward, it takes a portion back in the form of taxes. If the government takes back less than it gave out, there will be a deficit.
"The national debt is nothing more than a historical record of all of the dollars that were spent into the economy and not taxed back, and are currently being saved in the form of Treasury securities," Ms. Kelton said.
Ms. Kelton, a frequent speaker at business and financial conferences and the chief economic adviser to Mr. Sanders during his 2016 presidential campaign, points out that every dollar the government spends translates into a dollar of income for someone else. So a deficit in the public sector simultaneously produces a surplus outside the government.
The reverse is also true, Ms. Kelton maintains, and that can lead to trouble. The seven biggest American depressions or downturns going back 200 years, she said, were all preceded by government surpluses.
Ms. Kelton complains that modern monetary theorists are often incorrectly described as contending that "deficits don't matter." Of course they matter, she said.
What she disagrees with is the reason given. In her view, deficits are not a sign of excessive spending or necessarily a forerunner of inflation. They can be too big, especially if they are not used to increase the nation's productive capacity, or if there is a shortage of labor, raw materials and factories.
"If Congress authorizes too much spending and businesses are not nimble enough" to absorb it, there can be bottlenecks and price pressure, she acknowledged.
But she argues that it is much more likely that deficits are too small, depriving the economy of critical investments. The best way to stabilize the economy and ensure full employment and a humming economy, she said, is to have the federal government guarantee every American a job.
The notion that surpluses could cause economic downturns flips conventional thinking. Yet the idea of sectoral balances -- that government or nongovernment deficits are offset by surpluses on the other side -- is what some financial economists find so illuminating, even if they stop short of endorsing all of the theory's tenets.
"It is a great way of summarizing whether households and firms are living beyond their means," said Mr. Hatzius of Goldman Sachs. "It is a great indicator of potential financial crises."
In his view, giant private-sector deficits are much more alarming than public-sector ones because households and companies are at much greater risk of losing access to credit in a downturn. Unlike the Treasury, they can't print money -- or issue bonds -- when they run out.
Mr. McCulley, now retired from Pimco, used the same kind of analysis to guide his investing decisions after the financial crisis. He figured the only way that private borrowers could shrink their vast storehouse of debt was to have the government buy up those assets. He was unconcerned that the federal deficit would balloon as a result.
Pimco's view during the crisis, he said, was "shake hands with the government," because it had the largest checkbook. That is why the firm invested heavily, for example, in the federally guaranteed mortgage-backed securities that most other firms were shedding.
Mr. Koo of Nomura has further developed the idea of sectoral balances to explain the most recent wave of recessions and argue for larger government deficits. The problem that major economies in Japan, Europe and the United States have today, he said, is that despite low interest rates, investment opportunities in domestic markets don't offer sufficient returns to lure borrowers to go into debt, using the vast pools of available savings.
That means "the government has to spend money to keep the economy going," he said. And as long as the government invests in projects that produce an economic return greater than the yield on 10-year Treasury notes -- currently about 2.5 percent -- "this will never be a burden on taxpayers."
Ray Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates, one of the world's largest hedge funds, made a similar point in a paper he released recently about saving capitalism. Without any specific reference to M.M.T., he noted that "policymakers pay too much attention to budgets relative to returns on investments."
The View From St. Croix
A couple of M.M.T.'s academic strongholds are the University of Missouri-Kansas City and the Levy Economics Institute at Bard College. And there, too, Wall Street's attraction to the theory has played a role.
Warren Mosler, a hedge-fund mogul who resides in low-tax St. Croix, helped bankroll some of the work at those schools, donating money for student scholarships and conferences.
Mr. Mosler developed some of the ideas underlying M.M.T. from his own observations of financial operations, and has written a couple of short treatises.
He is used to doubters. "It's astounding," he said. How could the Fed chairman be wrong, he mused, and "somebody sitting in St. Croix in a pair of shorts be right?"
Ron Biscardi, chief executive of the investment firm Context Capital Partners, was one of those persuaded by the guy in shorts. When he read Mr. Mosler's book, the ideas struck him as both revolution and revelation.
Mr. Biscardi's company also runs conferences for the hedge-fund industry to which he has invited Ms. Kelton as a speaker. He had recently returned from one at the Fontainebleau Hotel in Miami Beach that featured tÃªte-Ã -tÃªtes between hundreds of investors and alternative asset managers and a keynote speech by Gary Cohn, the former director of the Trump administration's National Economic Council.
Mr. Biscardi described himself as a libertarian and conservative. To him, modern monetary theory means not only more government spending on infrastructure, but also lower taxes on the wealthy. After all, if government deficits can grow larger, there's no need to raise as much revenue.
To many mainstream economists, though, M.M.T. is a confused mishmash that proponents use to support their political objectives, whether big government programs like "Medicare for all" and the Green New Deal or smaller taxes. Think of the Mirror of Erised in the Harry Potter saga, which shows the heart's desire -- a tantalizing prospect that ultimately brings ruin.
From this perspective, M.M.T. is a version of free-lunchonomics, leaving the next generation to pay for this generation's profligacy.
Although several prominent mainstream economists have recently revised their thinking about the risks of large government debt, they continue to reject other tenets of M.M.T.
At some point, they insist, if the government just creates money to pay the bills, hyperinflation will kick in.
"The idea that deficits don't matter for countries that can borrow in their own currency I think is just wrong," the Federal Reserve chairman, Jerome H. Powell, testified before the Senate Banking Committee in February.

Reckoning With Keynes
Narayana Kocherlakota, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis from 2009 to 2015, is aware of the conflicts between M.M.T. and the traditional framework developed by John Maynard Keynes, in which it is rooted.
But he is more struck by their similarities rather than their differences. Both recommend that government should spend when the private sector isn't doing enough to employ the nation's work force, raw materials and factories to prompt growth. Both deem inflation to be insidious.
The inflationary threat looms particularly large for economists of his generation, Mr. Kocherlakota, 55, said. For them, the seminal experience was the scarring inflation of the 1970s. "The big lesson was that resources are always scarce," he said.
But over the past decade, he said, his thinking has evolved. Now Mr. Kocherlakota is more inclined to believe that scarcity is not the overriding problem and that the federal government could spend more without risk of excessive inflation.
If you put aside the theoretical disputations, Mr. Kocherlakota said, the important question is: How far is the United States from reaching the limits of its capacity?
Even with a jobless rate under 4 percent, he believes there is room to maneuver.
Mr. Kocherlakota said that compared to those within the Fed, chief executives, financiers and analysts who operate internationally tend to be more open to modern monetary theory in their analyses of government deficits and inflation.
"Folks who take a global perspective are much more likely to see a lot of unused capacity," he said. They realize "inflation is not built at home anymore, it's built through global pressures."
Mr. McCulley, the Pimco alumnus, would put his money on that. Increasing the deficit so that the government could invest in infrastructure and the labor force "would not make me bearish on the stock market at all," he said.
"At all," he repeated. "If anything, it would make me bullish."

Full text: The buoyant jobs market that has helped sustain American households for the better part of a decade did not go anywhere.
After an unexpectedly weak February -- just 20,000 new jobs were initially reported -- concerns arose that the remarkable wave of hiring might be ebbing. But employment surged again last month, beating the expectations of most economists with 196,000 new jobs, the Labor Department said Friday.
Even lowly February looked better: The department revised its report upward to 33,000 jobs. And unemployment remained at 3.8 percent in March, while wage growth kept its momentum, ensuring that pay is growing faster than inflation.
"We think the labor market is the strongest thing in the U.S. economy right now," said Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust. "We're encouraged by the wage gains."
The economy has now produced more than 21 million new jobs since the labor market bottomed out in 2010, and the unemployment rate has plunged from a peak of 10 percent in October 2009.
But in recent months, economists have seen reasons to doubt the strength of the economy. The invigorating effects of the tax cuts enacted at the end of 2017 are expected to fade. Large overseas economies have slowed, in part a reaction to continuing trade tensions. And while the stock market has rallied since a rout at the end of last year, other important financial indicators -- such as government bond yields -- suggest that investors expect growth to moderate.
President Trump contends that the Federal Reserve slowed the economy last year by pushing interest rates too high, and has said he intends to nominate the conservative economist Stephen Moore and the former pizza chain executive Herman Cain to the central bank's board.
"I personally think the Fed should drop rates," Mr. Trump said on Friday.
Mr. Trump won't necessarily get his way on interest rates. The Fed has already taken a softer stance: As recently as December, the central bank said it could raise rates in 2019, but it has since signaled that it probably wouldn't do so.
Economists said the latest jobs report showed that the Fed's willingness to hold interest rates at current levels was probably the right response for the economy.
"It doesn't tell the Fed that it's doing the wrong thing by remaining patient," said Ellen Zentner, chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley.
The March jobs gain probably won't be enough to dispel all the pessimism, though.
The report contained evidence of a slowdown in manufacturing, a sector that has performed well over the past two years. Manufacturers shed 6,000 jobs in March, driven mostly by the auto sector, and added just 1,000 in February. Last year, the sector on average added 22,000 jobs a month.
Some manufacturers have been hit by tariffs imposed by other countries in response to those put in place by Mr. Trump.
Rob Parmentier, chief executive of Marquis Yachts in Green Bay, Wis., said sales to some of the company's biggest export markets had stalled as a result of the tariffs.
"There's a chance we'd have to lay people off if we don't get these tariffs fixed," Mr. Parmentier said. "I understand what the president's doing, but he's got to do it faster, or get a better perspective on what he's doing to American companies."
While the March jobs number exceeded expectations -- economists surveyed by FactSet predicted, on average, around 170,000 new jobs -- job growth has slowed. In the first three months of the year, the economy added 180,000 jobs on average, down from a monthly average of 223,000 for all of 2018.
But some economists did not see slower hiring as a cause for concern.
"The number from last year was not sustainable," said Martha Gimbel, research director at the job-search site Indeed. "What's more surprising is that we're still adding an average of 180,000 jobs at this point in a recovery."
Hiring was strong in some sectors: Professional and business services, which cover a broad swath of white-collar positions, added 37,000 jobs in March. Health care services added 61,000, bringing the total over the past 12 months to about half a million new jobs.
But it was the wage growth revealed in the jobs report that provided perhaps the strongest reason for optimism.
For years, even as the economy added jobs and unemployment kept falling, wage increases were lackluster. But employees now appear to be getting solid raises. Hourly wages in March were 3.2 percent higher than a year earlier, slightly lower than the 3.4 percent growth in February but still roughly double the annual inflation rate. And some economists said the slight decline in growth was no cause for concern.
"It's a volatile number; it tends to bounce up and down," Ms. Gimbel said. "What's more important is that we've had six straight months above 3 percent."
Steady wage growth may be the catalyst that helps keep the economic expansion going: Higher wages encourage more spending, and companies that wish to meet that consumer demand have to hire more people.
Firms in the leisure and hospitality sector have particularly benefited from people having more money to spend: Those businesses added 33,000 jobs in March.
Sean Moloney, owner of My Bartender, a company in Portland, Ore., that provides bartenders and drinks at events, said he expected to hire 40 to 50 people during this year's busy season, compared with around 15 people five years ago. And his customers are also spending more on the drinks served.
"People are willing to spend the extra money to get something other than the bargain brand," he said.

Pressuring Fed, President Urges More Stimulus

Full text: WASHINGTON -- President Trump on Friday called on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates and take additional steps to stimulate economic growth, his latest attempt to put the traditionally independent central bank under his thumb.
Speaking to reporters before traveling to the southwestern border, the president once again criticized the Fed's interest rate increases in 2018, saying "they really slowed us down." Mr. Trump, who is presiding over one of the longest sustained economic expansions in United States history, also said the Fed should do more to give the economy a lift -- including resuming a stimulus program that he opposed when it began under President Barack Obama.
Mr. Trump's comments came on the same day the Labor Department reported strong job growth, with employers adding 196,000 jobs last month. His remarks also coincide with his efforts to install allies at the Fed as he heads into a re-election campaign that will largely be a referendum on the state of the economy. While the economy is still strong and unemployment remains low, the effects of the president's $1.5 trillion tax cut are waning and his trade war has begun to hurt some American industries, as well as contributing to slower growth in China. Most forecasters see growth slowing this year, though Mr. Trump's economic advisers continue to see it speeding up.
But the president appears to be taking no chances. On Friday, he escalated his previous critiques of the Fed by pressing for it to resume the type of stimulus campaign it undertook after the recession to jump-start economic growth. That program, known as quantitative easing, resulted in the Fed buying more than $4 trillion worth of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities as a way to increase the supply of money in the financial system. As the economy recovered, the Fed began to reverse that program, slowly winnowing its portfolio of bonds in a process known as quantitative tightening.
"Well I personally think the Fed should drop rates," Mr. Trump said. "I think they really slowed us down. There's no inflation. I would say in terms of quantitative tightening, it should actually now be quantitative easing. Very little if any inflation. And I think they should drop rates, and they should get rid of quantitative tightening. You would see a rocket ship. Despite that, we're doing very well."
The Labor Department's numbers signal a rebound from an unexpectedly lackluster February. It was the 102nd straight month of job gains. Wages were also up, with average hourly earnings in March 3.2 percent higher than a year earlier. And unemployment remained low at 3.8 percent.
[Read more about the March jobs report, which showed a return to solid growth.]
The president has become increasingly bold in his efforts to influence the Fed, which he and his advisers blame for economic growth falling short of the 4 percent annual rate last year as he promised. He has repeatedly criticized his handpicked Fed chairman, Jerome H. Powell, and has described the central bank as a counterweight to his economic policies.
The Fed raised interest rates four times last year, to the current range of 2 percent to 2.25 percent, drawing frequent rebukes from Mr. Trump. Such criticism is unusual for presidents, who typically avoid commenting on monetary policy.
But the Fed has since diverted from what had been a steady march of interest rate increases, in the face of stock market turmoil, growing domestic and global economic risks and pressure from Mr. Trump. The central bank does not expect to increase rates at all this year and has cut its growth projections to 2.1 percent for 2019.
As he enters the 2020 campaign, Mr. Trump is banking on a much faster pace of growth than the Fed and most outside economists say is likely. Global growth is moderating, with slowdowns in Europe and China underway. And there are signs of weakness in the United States, where chief executives see investment, hiring and sales growth all slowing this year and business economists say the risks of undershooting economic growth are higher than overshooting.
Democrats denounced Mr. Trump's comments, saying they showed his disregard for the traditional independence of the Fed and his desire to use its powers to help him win re-election.
"There's no question that President Trump is seeking to undermine the long-term stability of the economy and independence of the Federal Reserve to boost his own re-election prospects," said Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Finance Committee.
Larry Kudlow, Mr. Trump's top economic adviser, said on Friday that the president was concerned about a global slowdown and wanted the Fed ensure the American economy continued to grow.
"We are facing a worldwide slowdown. You know, recession, arguably," Mr. Kudlow said in an interview on Bloomberg TV. "Europe is not doing well. Germany itself may be in recession. That troubles us."
Mr. Kudlow denied that the president was trying to infringe on the Fed's independence and said he simply wanted it to keep things thriving.
"We're not pressuring. We're not going after their independence," he said. "We just don't want any threats to this rebuilding, reviving, growing economy."
But in recent days, Mr. Trump has made it increasingly clear that he will do what it takes to keep the Fed heading in the direction he wants.
The president said on Thursday that he planned to nominate Herman Cain, a Republican who abandoned his 2012 presidential campaign in the face of sexual harassment allegations and who started a political action committee to combat what he claims is "misinformation" about Mr. Trump, to a seat on the Fed's seven-member board. Mr. Trump also plans to nominate Stephen Moore, an adviser and conservative economist who has become a vocal critic of the Fed's interest rate increases.
Those selections are a marked shift from his previous nominations to the board. The president has tended to tap largely conventional candidates, not loyalists or those with starkly contrarian views. His choice of Mr. Powell for chairman was seen as a vote for consistency on the Fed, given Mr. Powell's approach was expected to be -- and indeed has been -- in line with his predecessor, Janet L. Yellen, who called for a moderate pace of rate increases.
Mr. Trump's three other Fed appointments have also been fairly unsurprising -- Richard Clarida, whom he appointed as vice chairman, was a Columbia University economist and a scholar in monetary policy. Randal K. Quarles, who oversees bank supervision, worked in the financial industry and at the Treasury Department in previous Republican administrations and Michelle W. Bowman was the state bank commissioner of Kansas.
Wall Street analysts, economists and at least one Republican senator warned on Friday that Mr. Trump's choice of political actors could wind up compromising the Fed in a way that could be detrimental to the health of the economy.
"In our view, the selections could raise questions about the independence of the Federal Reserve and could be perceived as an attempted politicization of monetary policy," researchers at Barclays wrote in a note to clients, adding, "the experience of each candidate does not seem to be the main reason the Trump administration is considering their nominations."
Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, who ran against Mr. Cain for the Republican nomination, told Politico that he would prefer nonpolitical appointees.
"I would like to see nominees that are economists first and not partisans. I think it's important that the Fed be a nonpartisan entity," Mr. Romney said. "The key is that someone is outside of the political world and is an economic leader, not a partisan leader."
It is unclear whether Mr. Moore or Mr. Cain, who are still undergoing background checks and have yet to be formally nominated, will be confirmed by the Senate. Mr. Trump has previously faced pushback on two of his Fed choices, neither of whom were considered highly contentious but nonetheless failed to gain traction.
Nellie Liang, an economist and financial regulation expert, withdrew from consideration after financial industry lobbyists worked against her nomination and Senate Republicans made clear they would not vote to confirm her. And Marvin Goodfriend, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University and a former monetary policy adviser to the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., languished in the last Congress after lawmakers questioned his previous views on inflation.
For now, most Senate Republicans have said they will wait for confirmation hearings before determining their votes.
Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, has remained mum on both selections for the Fed. But aides and senators close to Mr. McConnell said that he had made it clear that he had no intention of moving ahead quickly with either nomination, giving the president and his staff ample time to vet both men and consider other candidates.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- President Trump said on Thursday that he planned to nominate Herman Cain, who abandoned his 2012 presidential bid in the face of escalating accusations of sexual misconduct, for a seat on the Federal Reserve Board.
Mr. Trump, speaking from the Oval Office, called Mr. Cain, the former chief executive of Godfather's Pizza, "a truly outstanding individual" and said, "I've told my folks that's the man."
The decision to consider Mr. Cain is the second time in weeks that the president has floated candidates with deeply held political views and past ethical issues to fill a seat on the Fed, signaling his intent to put allies on a traditionally independent body. It comes as Mr. Trump has continued to attack the Fed and his handpicked chairman, Jerome H. Powell, for raising interest rates in 2018, saying those moves slowed economic growth.
Last month, Mr. Trump said he planned to nominate Stephen Moore, a conservative economist who advised his presidential campaign and has become a vocal critic of the central bank's recent rate increases, as a Fed governor.
Mr. Trump has staked his presidency on a booming economy and his re-election could hinge on whether it continues to surge or falter. The Fed, which has the ability to stimulate the economy by lowering interest rates and using other tools at its disposal, will play a crucial role in the economy's trajectory.
While presidents have long stocked regulatory agencies with partisan appointees in pursuit of ideological goals, the Fed's seven-member board of governors has largely been an exception given the role it plays in the United States economy. The Fed's primary job is to guide the economy, typically by adjusting interest rates. It aims for sustainable growth, maximum employment and stable prices. It also regulates banks and oversees the plumbing of the financial system.
Most developed nations have granted their central banks considerable autonomy over policymaking precisely because of concerns that politicians would seek to increase short-term growth at the expense of inflation and instability. Some modern presidents have opined openly about what the Fed should do, including President George Bush, who declared in a State of the Union address that the central bank should keep rates low.
But in recent decades, the volume of public commentary greatly diminished as politicians concluded that pressuring the Fed was counterproductive.
The president has largely abandoned that tradition. Last year, as interest rates rose and the stock market declined, Mr. Trump repeatedly attacked Fed policy as "crazy," "wild" and "loco." He asked aides whether he could replace the chairman and lamented privately that Mr. Powell's appointment was one of his biggest regrets.
The Fed, which raised rates for five consecutive quarters amid a roaring economy with the lowest unemployment rate in nearly two decades, has since paused its campaign. Mr. Powell has repeatedly rebuffed any suggestion that the central bank is being influenced by Mr. Trump's broadsides, saying it is adopting a more "patient" approach to interest rates given signs of economic weakness in the United States and abroad.
With two open seats on the seven-member Fed, Mr. Trump has the ability to drastically shape the central bank for the foreseeable future. The president has already appointed four of the Fed's current governors, who carry 14-year terms. One governor, Lael Brainard, is a holdover from the Obama administration.
The appointment and confirmation of Mr. Moore and Mr. Cain could put the Fed in uncharted territory. While the institution has strongly rooted values around technical competence and apolitical debate, Mr. Trump's latest choices have been political actors rather than in-the-weeds experts in any of the main areas in which the Fed makes policy.
Two governors alone cannot entirely shape Fed policy, but they can have an effect on decisions. The Federal Open Market Committee, which sets interest rates, consists of 12 voting members, including the seven governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and four regional Federal Reserve Bank presidents, who serve one-year terms on a rotating basis. Changes to interest rates must be approved by a majority of the voting members.
Both Mr. Moore and Mr. Cain are undergoing background checks, and if nominated, must be confirmed by the Senate.
The choice of such candidates to fill two of the most powerful jobs in economic policy is raising fears among some Fed veterans that the president is installing political allies at the central bank to do his bidding.
"It's one thing to put cronies into the executive branch, but I think the central bank is another kind of institution that it's so critical in that it holds the reins solely to monetary policy," said Sarah Bloom Raskin, who served on the Fed's board of governors from 2010 to 2014. "It has the potential to undermine the credibility of monetary policy."
Mr. Cain's nomination is being supported by Larry Kudlow, who heads the National Economic Council and also recommended Mr. Moore for a Fed seat, according to a person familiar with the discussions.
While he heaped praise on his "friend" Mr. Cain, Mr. Trump earlier in the day continued his assault on the "destructive actions" taken by the Fed and said on Twitter that the economy was very strong despite the central bank's efforts.
The selection of Mr. Moore and Mr. Cain appeared to be a counterweight to Mr. Powell. But while Mr. Moore has been publicly critical of the Fed and called for Mr. Powell to resign, Mr. Cain's views are less clear.
As a presidential candidate, Mr. Cain rode a brief surge in popularity to the top of the polls on the back of his "9-9-9" economic plan. The proposal called for scrapping the existing tax code and replacing it with a flat 9 percent income tax, a 9 percent business tax and a 9 percent national retail sales tax. The concept was hailed by some for its simplicity, but it ultimately fizzled with his campaign.
On monetary policy, his views are equally unorthodox. In a 2012 op-ed in The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Cain accused the central bank of manipulating the value of the dollar by raising and lowering interest rates by whim and called for a return to the gold standard, which was abandoned in 1971.
"For the last 40 years in Washington, regulate has meant manipulate, with the Federal Reserve raising and lowering interest rates and buying and selling assets at its own discretion," Mr. Cain wrote, arguing that a complex society needs fixed standards. "A dollar should be defined -- as it was prior to 1971 under the postwar Bretton Woods system -- as a fixed quantity of gold."
Mr. Cain is also a former chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, a role that is often given to local business leaders. In a 2011 interview with The Atlantic, Drue Jennings, who served with Mr. Cain on the board, said that Mr. Cain was an "inflation hawk" when it came to monetary policy, a moniker attributed to those who view rising prices as a threat to economic growth and favor higher interest rates to keep inflation in check.
Mr. Trump has made clear he has no interest in a Fed governor who wants to raise rates but, more recently, Mr. Cain has shown that he has evolved on the subject.
"If I were offered the job, I would try to encourage the Fed not to make inflation a fear factor because deflation, as Stephen Moore had pointed out in a great article that he wrote along with another economist, deflation is more of a fear factor than inflation," Mr. Cain said in a February interview with the Fox Business Network.
Perhaps most important to Mr. Trump, Mr. Cain has shown that he is loyal to the president. In September, Mr. Cain formed the America Fighting Back PAC, which has a mission of publicly rebutting what he believes is misinformation about Mr. Trump.
"We're offering a compelling, solid refutation to what you hear from the media and the rest of the left about President Trump and conservative ideas," Mr. Cain said at the time.
It is unclear whether Mr. Cain will clear the background check. His presidential campaign came to a screeching halt after several women came forward with accusations of sexual harassment or improper behavior.
The selection of Mr. Cain drew backlash on Thursday from some of those women.
Ginger White, who publicly said in 2011 that she and Mr. Cain had had an affair, said that he should not be rewarded for such actions. Ms. White said that the affair was on and off for 13 years and that Mr. Cain denied it because he was seeking the Republican nomination for president.
"We need honesty and integrity in those who are appointed to public office," Ms. White said in a statement released by her lawyer, Gloria Allred. "Herman Cain should not be rewarded for his bad behavior. In my opinion, he lacks what should be required for appointment to the Federal Reserve or any public office."
Sharon Bialek, who is also represented by Ms. Allred, came forward in 2011 and accused Mr. Cain of grabbing her in a sexually aggressive way when she sought his help after losing her job at the National Restaurant Association in the late 1990s. Ms. Bialek said in a statement on Thursday evening that Mr. Cain sexually harassed her and that he was not fit for public service.
"I did not think that he was a man of character then, and I do not think he is now," Ms. Bialek said. "Anyone who uses their position of power to take advantage of a woman does not possess the character, integrity or values required to serve on the Federal Reserve Board."
In some ways, Mr. Cain, who preferred news interviews to intensive retail campaigning, presaged Mr. Trump's own outsider campaign four years later. But unlike the president's presidential bid, Mr. Cain's was fatally wounded when he faced charges of sexual misconduct.
In October 2011, Politico reported that Mr. Cain, as head of the National Restaurant Association, had been accused of sexually harassing two women, who left the trade group after receiving financial payouts and signing nondisclosure agreements. One of the women, who was from Chicago, said that Mr. Cain made an unwanted and rough physical advance.
Confronted with the claims, Mr. Cain initially did not deny them. He later proclaimed his innocence and sought to cast blame on political rivals and the news media for what he called a smear campaign.
Other women emerged soon after to say that they, too, had been sexually harassed by Mr. Cain. By that December, he dropped out of the presidential race.

Full text: Just when it seemed that democracy was all but dead in Turkey, voters delivered a sharp electoral rebuke to their authoritarian president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Unofficial results in municipal elections over the weekend show that Mr. Erdogan and his Justice and Development Party lost control of Ankara, the capital, and Istanbul, the financial center and launching pad for Mr. Erdogan's political career.
Mr. Erdogan was not on the ballot, and his party still controls Parliament, but the vote was the worst election defeat of his nearly two decades in office. And while he won re-election last year, a 2017 referendum that only narrowly gave him new authority over the legislature and judiciary presaged his weakening support.
Opposition candidates in the municipal races capitalized on growing discontent with his repression and economic mismanagement. The results signaled that, if the opposition stays united and forward-looking, it could mount a true challenge to Mr. Erdogan in the next presidential election, in 2023.
The president's main rival, the Republican People's Party, and its allies promised political change, job creation, better education and improved social services. Opposition members carefully monitored vote tallies and have even slept on sacks of counted ballots to ensure they are not tampered with by Erdogan loyalists.
Meanwhile, the pro-Kurdish People's Democratic Party's disciplined effort in the bigger cities to support Republican People's Party candidates most likely provided the winning margin in Istanbul and Ankara.
For more than a decade, Mr. Erdogan has dominated Turkey, promoting Islamic religious values and ruthlessly crushing those he sees as adversaries. Over the years, he has manipulated the system to accrue sweeping executive powers, control the army and crack down on civil liberties. His cronies largely control the media, but Turkey still jails more journalists than any other nation.
The president inserted himself directly into the local election process, handpicking a longtime ally, Binali Yildirim, to run for mayor of Istanbul and choosing a former minister to run for mayor of Ankara. Their losses could deprive the president of a vast patronage apparatus that has bolstered his rule.
Appearing at as many as eight political rallies a day, Mr. Erdogan waged an aggressively negative campaign, accusing the opposition of criminality or terrorism, threatening lawsuits and fueling nationalist anger.
It's not surprising that voters saw the election as a referendum on Mr. Erdogan's rule. Turkey's economy fell into recession in March after years of enviable growth. The unemployment rate is now over 10 percent, and is as much as 30 percent among young people. In 2018, the value of the Turkish lira fell 28 percent. Inflation is at 20 percent.
Voters, particularly the young, are also concerned about corruption among members of the Erdogan family and its allies.
Mr. Erdogan's party is challenging the vote counts but said it would respect the results; despite his autocratic bent, Mr. Erdogan values the legitimacy that elections confer.
The United States and other Western democracies had been losing hope that Turkey can be a reliable ally given Mr. Erdogan's drift away from democratic values and NATO and toward Russia. The latest election results offer a chance to assure him that any tampering would widen that breach -- and further endanger economic and military partnerships.
One concern is that Mr. Erdogan could try to increase his flagging support by undertaking long-threatened military operations against America's Kurdish allies in Syria. Such a move may backfire, particularly if the operations go poorly.
Especially now that Turkey's political opposition has shown it is alive and capable of pushing back.

Full text: ISTANBUL -- Step by step over the years, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey sought to ensure nobody could challenge him. He marginalized adversaries. He purged the army, the police and the courts. He cowed the press. He strengthened his powers in the Constitution. And he promised Turks a bright economic future.
So it was a huge surprise when the outcome of weekend municipal voting showed on Monday that Mr. Erdogan's party had not only lost control of Ankara, the political center, but maybe Istanbul, the country's commercial center, his home city and longstanding core of support.
Even if the results were not final, they amounted to the most momentous political earthquake to shake Mr. Erdogan in nearly two decades of basically uncontested control at the helm of Turkey, a NATO ally and critical linchpin of stability in the region.
What was different this time was the rapidly tanking economy and a highly disciplined opposition.
It deployed monitors to not only scrutinize the vote tallies but also sleep on sacks of sealed counted ballots to guard against possible tampering by members of Mr. Erdogan's ruling Justice and Development Party, the AKP.
"We think they were not able to rig the election," said Ilayda Kocoglu, 28, vice president of the Istanbul branch of the opposition Republican People's Party, or CHP, who slept on some sacks herself. "They were not expecting us to be that organized, or that resolved."
The results do not mean that Mr. Erdogan, whose term as president lasts for four more years, will change his behavior, which includes promoting Islamic religious values over secularism, closer ties to Russia and chillier relations with NATO. But the election showed Mr. Erdogan has weaknesses.
"It's a catastrophe for him," said Asli Aydintasbas, a senior fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. "We now know he is not invincible."
Turkey's weakened economy, which had rapidly expanded for years under Mr. Erdogan, was at the top of voters' concerns, despite Mr. Erdogan's exhortations that the problems are not of his making. The country tumbled into a recession in March. Unemployment exceeds 10 percent, and up to 30 percent among young people. The Turkish lira lost 28 percent of its value in 2018 and continues to weaken. Inflation has reached 20 percent.
Ms. Kocoglu said she and her colleagues understood within an hour of the closing of polls Sunday night that they were watching Turkey's most momentous change since Mr. Erdogan took power. Even the most remote areas of the Istanbul metropolitan area showed a defeat for Mr. Erdogan's mayoral candidate.
As of Monday night, results from the High Election Council had still not been fully released and Mr. Erdogan's party had not conceded defeat in Istanbul. But the tally showed the opposition candidate, Ekrem Imamoglu, ahead with 99 percent of the votes counted.
At a late-night news briefing in Istanbul, Mr. Imamoglu said he was trusting in Turkey's institutions more than the AKP to confirm his victory. "I don't expect this from the party," he said. "For years to come AKP will not accept my win."
Opposition mayors in Turkey's two most important cities give the Republican People's Party high-profile opportunities to show how it can govern effectively, with control of municipal services from garbage collection to mass transit. And Mr. Imamoglu has promised that as mayor of Istanbul, he would audit the books, a prospect that could create new problems for the AKP should he uncover evidence of corruption under the ruling party's watch.
The Republican People's Party, long criticized for a lack of organization, for once was well prepared for the election. Mr. Imamoglu, 49, a former district mayor, mobilized thousands of volunteers to observe every ballot box in the greater metropolitan area and record the count on a specially designed application, giving the party its own independent tabulation.
"We were able to compare our numbers with theirs," Ms. Kocoglu said.
A decisive moment came at 9 p.m. Sunday when Mr. Erdogan gave his first speech of the evening, claiming victory for the AKP overall in the municipal district elections. The election commission suddenly stopped releasing election results for Istanbul, as did the semiofficial Anadolu news agency, which is widely followed on election nights as the source favored by the government for results.
The president's camp had already seen which way the vote was going and had stopped the count, said Ozgur Unluhisarcikli, the Ankara director for the German Marshall Fund of the United States, a research institute. "They stopped it to think what they could do," he said. There was even discussion of some kind of intervention, he said.
"We were very afraid," Ms. Kocoglu said. She recalled several elections when the election commission had stopped releasing details in the count, only to resume later and show an unlikely jump in favor of the ruling party.
Opposition supporters say this happened in a previous election for mayor of Ankara, and during the count for the 2017 constitutional referendum that gave Mr. Erdogan more executive powers and even in the presidential election in June.
The CHP's efforts to tabulate its own count in 2018 failed when the party's computer system broke down midcount. Its candidate later conceded defeat.
But this time was different. When Mr. Erdogan's candidate, Binali Yildirim, a former prime minister, declared himself the winner in Istanbul, Mr. Imamoglu immediately went public, announcing that he was leading in the race and had the records to prove it. He made 10 public statements of his lead through the night.
Mr. Erdogan is responsible for what many critics call an imperial presidency in Turkey. He oversaw a severe repression and government purging after a failed 2016 military coup attempt that he blamed on a longtime rival-in-exile, Fethullah Gulen, a cleric who lives in the United States. Under Mr. Erdogan, Turkey also has been a leading jailer of journalists.
But Mr. Erdogan's domination as Turkey's leader is also attributed to his unquestioned political talents and the failure of the main opposition party to put forward good candidates and broaden its appeal. CHP supporters have often questioned why their leaders have seemed to hand election after election to Mr. Erdogan.
The determination of the opposition was one thing, but support across society and even inside Mr. Erdogan's own party appeared to waver in the latest vote.
"The opposition stood firm, and there were signs of a public unleashing," Mr. Unluhisarcikli said, describing strong public support on Twitter and other social media.
By 11 p.m. Sunday, Mr. Erdogan appeared in Ankara and conceded the loss of at least one city to the opposition -- a huge setback by itself.
Then people inside Mr. Erdogan's party headquarters posted screenshots taken from AKP computer monitors showing the opposition candidate in Istanbul leading the race. Mr. Erdogan's own supporters were apparently leaking the information, said Ms. Aydintasbas at the European Council for Foreign Relations.
Mr. Erdogan has become increasingly aloof over the years, surrounded in his vast presidential palace by a smaller and smaller circle of aides and ministers.
Yet political analysts were in little doubt that he made the decision to allow the true results for the Istanbul vote to be released Monday morning in order to protect his own electoral legacy.
"Erdogan is not a crazy person, he is intelligent," Ms. Kocoglu said.
Ms. Aydintasbas said Mr. Erdogan, who has always drawn legitimacy from the ballot box, would have seen it was impossible to alter the result. "There was no real way," she said. "They did not find a way of doing it without losing legitimacy."
Others said Mr. Erdogan knew the risks to the economy if there were a wrangle over the election or a protracted dispute. The lira could fall sharply, as it did last summer, with drastic repercussions for businesses and livelihoods.
By accepting the election result, Mr. Erdogan has saved the reputation of the Turkish electoral system, which has given him legitimacy over the last 17 years, Mr. Unluhisarcikli said. "With this one election Erdogan has dispensed the clouds of doubt of all the past elections."
The swing away from Mr. Erdogan and his party in his home city, a place that he often describes with love and emotion, showed an unexpected success from the opposition alliance, which persuaded voters to vote tactically, despite their differences. Votes from the minority Kurds, and from unhappy conservatives who abandoned Mr. Erdogan, were critical, said Ms. Aydintasbas, who has followed Mr. Erdogan's career closely.
Ms. Kocoglu said that the election was a critical victory for the opposition since no further elections are scheduled for four years.

Full text: In any divorce, lawyers are the only surefire winners, and as Britain muddles through one of the biggest, messiest and most complicated breakups in economic history, the country's top law firms are booming.
Brexit, as Britain's separation from the European Union is known, is just one of many reasons that the highest-grossing firms are enjoying their best results in a decade. Virtually every practice area is thriving.
Regulatory lawyers, those steeped in the staggering legal minutia produced by Brexit, have lately gone from drudges to rainmakers. These attorneys strategize with clients for life after Europe's single market, consultations that often end in bewilderment and rage.
"There's been some swearing, some clients whose faces have drained of color, when they realize the sort of impact this all will have," said Andrew Hood, a regulatory and trade partner at Fieldfisher, a London-based firm with more than 1,000 lawyers. "And in the last six weeks, the number of clients who have woken up worried about what a no-deal Brexit looks like has doubled or tripled."
Law firms do not break out performance data by practice. But managing partners at the busiest firms said in interviews that their biggest clients were now spending upward of $10 million for "mitigation actions" on Brexit-related matters, such as restructuring, intellectual property rights and employment law. Even more work is expected as companies gear up to rewrite hundreds of thousands of contracts of every variety in what has been called "a massive repapering exercise."
"You get to the end of one financial year and think, it's the next one I'm worried about," said David Patient, managing partner at Travers Smith, which first started working with financial clients 1801. "We've been saying that for two or three years now, and we've been growing across the sectors at around 10 percent."
Last year, the top 100 law firms in Britain brought in 24 billion pounds in revenue -- the equivalent of $32 billion -- about Â£8 billion more in inflation-adjusted terms than in 2007, before the financial crisis, according to data collected by The Lawyer, a monthly British magazine for commercial lawyers and in-house counsel.
Over the same period, those firms have added 21,000 lawyers to their head count. The additional bodies have enhanced profits per equity partner, the bragging-rights metric in the profession. Those profits have risen each year since the Brexit referendum passed in 2016, and now average the equivalent of $1.4 million per partner at the top 10 firms.
Though law firms often prosper in times of uncertainty, few partners expected an upturn of this size. The contrast with the bleak days that followed the financial crisis in 2008 could not be starker. Then, attorneys at the most prestigious firms in the City of London, the financial district, were worried that as their biggest clients filed for bankruptcy, their firms would soon follow.
There were layoffs and pay freezes, but lawyers also kept busy restructuring companies or ushering them through insolvency. More recently, there were windfalls from investigations into allegations of frauds, like Volkswagen's diesel emissions scandal.
Then came June 23, 2016, and the colossal billable-hour generator known as Brexit.
"Well, I left the office at 11 last night," Susan Bright, a regional managing partner at Hogan Lovells, said one recent morning, sitting at a conference room table on the firm's 11th floor. "And these guys were still at it."
Charles Brasted, the firm's resident Brexit sage, sat nearby and smiled with surprising contentment, a marathoner relishing his endurance.
"My emails probably show that I send emails at 1 or 2 in the morning," he said. "And I start sending emails at 5 or 6 in the morning."
The two attorneys and a handful of colleagues had just finished a Brexit webinar, an audio-only production for about 150 clients. The clients emailed questions, which filled an inbox shown on a video screen on a wall.
"If there is no deal, could W.T.O. members refuse to recognize the U.K.'s membership to the W.T.O.?" one question read, referring to the World Trade Organization. (The W.T.O. is where Britain would negotiate international trade in the event of a no-deal Brexit.)
"In short, no," Aline Doussin, head of the firm's United Kingdom trade practice, said into a microphone. "Legally, the U.K. is a member in its own right to the W.T.O."
Brexit webinars have proliferated in the last two years, just one way in which firms reach for a share of a new up-for-grabs field. The Legal 500, a British clients guide, has even begun to list top-tier firms in a Brexit category for their ability to minimize risk.
Vying for Brexit business has helped big law in Britain get over its traditionally reticent approach to self-promotion. A few weeks ago, Eversheds Sutherland, a firm with more than 2,800 lawyers around the world, installed in its lobby an immense video screen that could have been lifted from a hockey arena. It cycles silently through slickly produced slides, including one that trumpets its latest financial results: "Announcing a 10% Increase in Global Revenue in 2018."
"Our lobby," Matthew Allen, an Eversheds senior partner, said during a tour of the firm, "used to be kind of quiet."
Firms now have Instagram and Twitter accounts that highlight their Brexit expertise, with links to in-house podcasts, white papers and the occasional sales pitch video.
"Brexit for a number of our clients is a problem that they need to solve," a Linklaters partner, Matthew Keogh, says in a video on the firm's Brexit page. "And Linklaters is a problem-solving firm."
Freshfields, the oldest international law firm in the world, has an email address dedicated to Brexit. Fieldfisher operates a Brexit hotline and blog.
Even practice areas that are not linked to Brexit have benefited from it. The Leave vote was followed by a more than 10 percent drop in the British pound, which was a come-hither to foreign companies eyeing potential mergers and acquisitions. Suddenly, a lot of British companies looked like bargains, said Richard Cranfield of Allen & Overy, which features an online "Brexit law microsite."
"There was a timeout in the summer of 2016," he said in a phone interview, discussing mergers and acquisition activity. "Then autumn came around, and I think the uncertainty factor was outweighed by continuing low interest rates and the availability of financing."
The currency's struggles have also been good for litigators. The efficiency of London's court system has long made it popular with foreigners filing international lawsuits, and a cheaper currency has improved the cost benefit of litigation.
"Cases that might not have been brought when sterling was strong are being brought," said Nigel Boardman, a partner at Slaughter and May, which has offices in London, Brussels, Hong Kong and Beijing. "Legal costs become a smaller proportion of total expenses, and the reward is in a different currency."
The winners here include newly minted attorneys. Client demand has made hiring competitive, which has driven up starting salaries. Last year, the United States-based Milbank Tweed Hadley & McCloy announced that it would leapfrog rivals and pay first-year associates $190,000. (That's more than newcomers to Goldman Sachs.) Nearly every large firm in London soon followed suit.
"Of course they did," said Freddie Lawson of the legal recruitment firm Fox Rodney Search. "It's an arms race."
Unlike their clients, law firms don't need to worry about delays at French ports. Nor are they sweating new tariff regimens, unless it's on behalf of the executives paying for their labors.
They have, however, been busy Brexit-proofing themselves. With thousands of London-based bankers expected to relocate to Europe in coming years, law firms have been opening or expanding offices in financial capitals all over the Continent. Since the referendum, more than 2,000 British lawyers have joined the Irish Roll of Solicitors -- for now, simply a matter of submitting an application -- so that they can continue to practice in European Union courts, among other privileges.
Thirteen percent of the entire Roll is now made up of British lawyers who applied since the 2016 vote, a spokeswoman for the Law Society of Ireland said.
How long this frenetic era will last is a matter of some hand-wringing in Britain. If enough businesses relocate, if London loses its hold as Europe's financial center, decline is inevitable.
"What's now in the back of everyone's mind is that Brexit may be great for lawyers in short term," said Jolyon Maugham, a tax lawyer and anti-Brexit campaigner. "But it's like you're a funeral director at the time of the plague. You're busy in the moment but you fear a bit for your business model."

Modern Monetary Theory Makes Sense, to a Point

Full text: The term "modern monetary theory" has been talked about so much lately that we mainstream economists need to try to understand it.
We're having trouble, though I'm beginning to suspect that it may be because M.M.T., as it's often called, is really just a voguish name for a group of old and, for the most part, sensible ideas, repackaged in a new form.
M.M.T. is sometimes invoked to justify reckless government borrowing for marginally good causes, without raising taxes. Well, here's a spoiler alert: Though increased spending on infrastructure, education, social welfare and the environment may be wise, and rising deficits may make sense some of the time, we really cannot borrow ceaselessly without risking real harm.
First, though, what actually is modern monetary theory? Stephanie Kelton of Stony Brook University, an adviser to Senator Bernie Sanders in his 2016 presidential campaign, has emerged as a leading spokeswoman for this theory.
In "How We Think About the Deficit Is Mostly Wrong," a 2017 opinion piece in The New York Times, she said the very first question people asked when confronted by a proposal for increased government spending was, "How are you going to pay for it?"
She called this an "almost Pavlovian" impulse that is "holding us back." Worrying about the deficit, she said, comes from an error in thinking: failing to realize that "the government's deficit is mirrored by an equivalent surplus in another part of the economy."
This seems to be similar to an idea that was popular during the New Deal in the Great Depression of the 1930s. Supporters of the Roosevelt administration dismissed worries about rising national debt, saying it was fine because "we owe it to ourselves." That was a half-truth.
That claim would have been accurate only in an extreme, theoretical case: if everyone had identical government bond holdings and paid identical taxes to cover the interest and principal that they were paying to themselves. In such a hypothetical situation, debt and taxes would cancel each other and the level of government debt would be meaningless. But we are never going to be in that situation in the real world.
In a video, Professor Kelton put the issues in the simplest terms: "The only potential risk with the national debt increasing over time is inflation. And to the extent that you don't believe the U.S. has a long-term inflation problem, you shouldn't believe that the U.S. is facing a long-term debt problem."
Yet by implying that inflation needs to be monitored, she also implied that the government shouldn't borrow and spend excessively, with which I heartily agree.
Furthermore, she was right to say that, in some cases, Americans overreact to government deficits. In fact, there is a long history of disputes by accountants on how deficits should be defined. For example, it has been proposed that the federal government should adopt separate capital and operating budgets -- differentiating long-term investments from operating costs.
But it is not obvious how to do this, and the change has not been made. These accounting issues are technical and don't provide useful slogans for influencing public opinion, as modern monetary theory does.
Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York may be the theory's most visible supporter. In her advocacy of the Green New Deal program that she introduced with a fellow Democrat, Senator Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts, she has used the theory to dismiss criticisms that increased spending would require increased taxation.
Yet the Green New Deal -- which the Republican-controlled Senate rejected on Tuesday in a procedural vote -- looks awfully expensive. When the cost of her plan was pointed out to her in a National Public Radio interview with Steve Inskeep last month, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said: "I think the first thing that we need to do is kind of break the mistaken idea that taxes pay for a hundred percent of government expenditure."
When pressed, however, she said,"When we decide to go into the realm of deficit spending, we have to do so responsibly." Because there are great opportunities for government investment at the moment and interest rates are low, these programs should go forward with deficit spending. Once again, this is a conventional argument: It makes sense to spend when the return on government investments exceeds the borrowing rate.
These are reasonable ideas. They are not always expressed in ways that are appealing to mainstream economists, however, so it's not surprising that two Harvard economists recently wrote articles severely criticizing modern monetary theory. Kenneth Rogoff did so in "Modern Monetary Nonsense," while Lawrence Summers wrote, "The Left's Embrace of Modern Monetary Theory Is a Recipe for Disaster."
I wouldn't be that harsh. It seems that modern monetary theory is not so much a recipe for disaster as it is a not entirely original series of ideas that are not well defined or well integrated, and whose implications have been exaggerated.
Entire fields of study in economics departments are devoted to grappling with some of these problems. For a serious examination of issues concerning public debt, for example, consider the classic 1979 study "On the Determination of the Public Debt," by Robert Barro of Harvard.
Professor Barro said, in essence, that the government faced time-varying expenditure needs and, optimally, could attempt to keep tax rates constant by varying borrowing. Then there is the 1936 opus of John Maynard Keynes, "The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money," which prescribes countercyclical deficit spending to stabilize the economy.
Are such works new enough to be called "modern"? If so, they might be considered the core foundations for modern monetary theory, though I haven't seen them cited that way.
But I don't expect most people to read these dense works on public finance and macroeconomic theory. It's more likely that people who aren't professional economists will be influenced by simpler stories and metaphors that may, unfortunately, encourage fallacious thinking.
Still, I think the modern monetary theorists have a point: We should not react automatically against new expenditures that increase the deficit. There do appear to be some urgent needs that might justify more debt for a while. But acknowledging this does not require a revolution in economic theory, and it does not license unlimited spending or carelessly adding debt upon debt.

The Mick Mulvaney Presidency

Full text: This should have been one of the best weeks of Donald Trump's presidency -- a week when the shadow of impeachment lifted, when his fiercest critics were dramatically wrong-footed, when the NO COLLUSION! tweets suddenly came with a certified-by-Robert-Mueller stamp.
But the rule of the Trump administration is that even political victories must be followed by egregious acts of self-sabotage. And so it was that the White House took the opportunity afforded by the Mueller investigation's wrap-up to back a lawsuit against Obamacare that even the health care law's conservative critics believe is frivolous, reviving a debate that tanked Trump's approval rating during 2017's repeal-and-replace debacle, and that no Republican of consequence wants to reopen today.
Then just to add an extra self-inflicted wound, the administration this week also endorsed defunding the Special Olympics -- a position that lasted all of 48 hours before Trump reversed it, blaming "my people" rather than himself.
[ Listen to "The Argument" podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt. ]
What unites both of these blunders, apart from simple political stupidity, is that neither has much to do with actual policymaking. There is little chance that John Roberts, having declined to do away with Obamacare when the law faced a reasonable constitutional challenge, will rule in favor of a more implausible attack. There is zero chance that the Special Olympics will be defunded; the budget that imagined doing so was a symbolic statement that gets ignored by Congress every year.
So why revive the Obamacare debate? Why set yourself up for "Trump Defunds Special Olympics" headlines? The answer is that there are effectively two Trump presidencies. One offers something like what the president promised on the campaign trail -- a break with Paul Ryan's green-eyeshade approach to entitlement reform, a more moderate tack on health care, an indifference to Obama-era conservative orthodoxies on fiscal and monetary policy.
The other offers a continuation of the Tea Party's insistence on spending cuts and Obamacare repeal, and appropriately its present leader is a former Tea Party congressman -- Mick Mulvaney, the Zelig of the administration, whose zeal is apparently the main reason that the Obamacare lawsuit now has administration support.
The first presidency is mostly real; the second presidency has been mostly imaginary ever since the failure of Obamacare repeal left Ryanism neutered. Trump hasn't done some of the biggest heterodox things he promised (an infrastructure bill, most notably). But he has ended austerity budgeting, ignored entitlement reform, reformed Obamacare around the edges while leaving its coverage guarantee intact, embraced protectionism and jawboned the Federal Reserve to be more inflationary.
At the same time, though, he has relied on personnel who are associated with 2010-era G.O.P. orthodoxy, rather than elevating the kind of conservatives who have actively theorized for a more populist right. Trump's choice of Steve Moore to the Federal Reserve is a recent case study: Instead of elevating a principled inflation dove (National Review editor and Bloomberg columnist Ramesh Ponnuru would have been my outside-the-box choice), Trump picked a hack who was obsessed with imaginary inflation under Obama, and only flipped to back a looser monetary policy because, well, it was the Trumpy thing to do.
But at least with Moore, Trump is getting someone whose official views now line up with his administration's political interests. With Mulvaney he has something stranger: A subordinate who plays let's-pretend-to-be-the-Tea-Party whenever he gets the chance, limning an essentially fictional version of the Trump presidency in budget documents and pushing the president to publicly back forays like the Obamacare lawsuit that have little chance of changing anything.
You could describe the cut-the-Special-Olympics budgets and anti-Obamacare efforts as just classic Republican hypocrisy, the tribute that big-spending vice plays to small-government virtue. But Trump campaigned in 2016 as the guy who would get rid of this charade, who would actually identify as a free-spending populist rather than a movement conservative, who would enable the G.O.P. to be a "worker's party" in its self-conception rather than just in its compromises with political reality.
Instead, thanks to his "people" and his own rhetorical shifts, he's ended up in a weirder position. The Trump record would justify, within limits, campaigning in 2020 the way he did in 2016, claiming to have governed as a populist rather than a Ryanist -- taking credit for reforming Obamacare rather than eliminating it, taking credit for Congress's guns-and-butter budgets and all the popular spending they contain.
But right now Trump is letting the mostly-imaginary version of his presidency, the Mulvaney version, define his priorities and public rhetoric. Which makes him look like a guy who didn't keep his promises, who promised to be a different kind of Republican and then kept trying to defund the Special Olympians and throw people off their health care coverage.
That's the most unpopular version of Trumpism, which is saying something. And his chances in 2020 will turn, in part, on whether he realizes it. His real economic record, however haphazard and under-theorized, could still win him re-election. The Mulvaney fantasia guarantees defeat.

Full text: PUERTO ORDAZ, Venezuela -- President NicolÃ¡s Maduro of Venezuela drove himself to an ailing iron plant this month to tout its export capacity amid tightening American sanctions.
"No one is going to stop us," he said with his wife by his side as they watched a conveyor belt of iron briquettes at the Guayana Steel Complex. "These are the days of victory!"
Two days later, the plant was out of business. It was paralyzed by the crippling national blackout that lasted almost five days and wiped out what little was left of Venezuela's heavy industry. The blackout, coupled with new American sanctions on Venezuela's critical oil sector, have pushed the country even closer to total economic collapse.
Venezuela's better-off citizens have tucked into dollar savings to buy portable power generators, imported canned foods and taken respite in hotels and steakhouses. The less fortunate saw a signal of possible respite on Friday with word that the Red Cross would soon undertake an emergency relief campaign in Venezuela.
For many people, however, the only palliative to the ever-growing hardships is the hope that the worsening conditions will topple Mr. Maduro.
The blackout drained about $ 1 billion from Venezuela's gross domestic product, or about 1 percent, according to investment bank Torino Capital. It left a wake of more than 500 looted businesses, at least 40 hospital patients who died and at least a half dozen shuttered factories.
Oil production equivalent to the entire output of a small petrostate like Brunei was irretrievably lost to the damage caused to oil fields by the sudden loss of power, according to IPD Latin America, a consultancy.
The blackout followed the United States ban in January on any purchases of Venezuelan oil, which only compounded years of mismanagement and corruption under Mr. Maduro and his predecessor, Hugo ChÃ¡vez.
"The sanctions make it almost impossible for the government to buy and import the things they need to run a country," said Francisco RodrÃ­guez, Torino Capital's chief economist.
Many opposition supporters see the economic pain as a bitter medicine required to get rid of Mr. Maduro. But to the president's supporters, the sanctions provide a much-needed foil to deflect blame for the economic ills.
Still few Venezuelans say they are prepared for the collapse of already dire living conditions if Mr. Maduro survives the onslaught from the new American sanctions, which are just beginning to filter through to the Venezuelan streets.
"The crisis will get worse," said Maria Altagracia Perozo, a pensioner from the working class neighborhood of CaucagÃ¼ita in Caracas, the capital. "We are told to search for candles, matches and kerosene because there won't be light."
Faced with shrinking oil revenue and an exodus of technicians, Mr. Maduro has struggled to reestablish basic services since the March 7 blackout, the worst ever. Water supply has been intermittent in most cities and students and state workers have stayed home this week after a fire at an electrical substation led to another blackout.
Less than half of Venezuelans said they were against President Trump's sanctions against the Venezuelan oil industry, according to a survey by the country's leading pollster, Datanalisis, in early March. It was a surprisingly low share given the direct impact of the sanctions on living standards.
"If I have to sacrifice a month to live without power or water, I will do it because I know it's the only way of improving this country," said Valdemar Ãlvarez, a lab analyst at the Sidor steel plant in Puerto Ordaz, who opposes Mr. Maduro.
Venezuela's economy is set to lose more than a quarter of its size this year, according to Mr. Rodriguez, one of the few Wall Street economists who still tries to forecast the scale of the country's decline. Inflation is on track to reach 51 million percent by year's end, rendering the national currency virtually worthless.
The magnitude of the country's collapse has been surpassed only by Zimbabwe in modern history, according to the Institute of International Finance.
Venezuela's crude oil production, which used to provide more than 90 percent of the country's hard currency, fell 13 percent in February -- the steepest decline in a decade -- according to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
It was the first month since the United States Treasury banned American companies from any dealings with the national oil producer, PetrÃ³leos de Venezuela SA, or Pdvsa. And the decline has only accelerated since.
Sanctions, power cuts and an accelerating brain drain could wipe out 60 percent Venezuela's oil production this year, according to consultants at IPD. Its analysts sees the country's output falling from 1.36 million barrels a day in February to a mere 550,000 barrels a day by the end of December, roughly on par with tiny Ecuador.
The United States, once Pdvsa's biggest customer, bought no Venezuelan oil in March for the first time since the 1970s, according to Department of Energy. And the ban does not officially come into force until April.
Mr. Maduro has struggled to shift exports elsewhere.
India, which Pdvsa had counted on as a substitute buyer, reduced its Venezuelan oil purchases in March under American pressure. Oil-trading firms ranging from Russia's Lukoil to Swiss-based Trafigura stopped supplying Venezuela with the oil products Pdvsa needs to keep operating.
The sanctions have accelerated Venezuela's vicious economic cycle, where declining oil exports leave Mr. Maduro with less money to invest in basic services. That, in turn, further degrades oil production, according to Siobhan Morden, an emerging markets strategist at the Nomura investment bank in New York.
"This multiplier feedback effect is very powerful and affects almost everyone" in Venezuela, she said. "The impact is going to be horrific."
The sanctions have made it difficult for the government to import the diesel fuel needed to run its thermal power plants. Pdvsa's dilapidated refineries, once some of the world's biggest, have long ceased to cover national needs for products like gasoline and diesel fuel.
Poor supply and maintenance of thermal power plants meant Venezuela was left without backup electrical supply when a wildfire under a transmission line brought down the country's main hydropower plant on March 7.
When the lights came back, entire Venezuelan industries had ceased to exist.
The blackout erased the last remnants of Venezuelan steel, aluminum and iron production, which Mr. Maduro had touted as alternatives to oil exports for income generation.
More than 10,000 workers had been reporting for shifts at the moribund plants to get free meals at the canteens, which had become the main source of food for many. Hyperinflation has long slashed their wages to a few dollars a month.
"It's like working in a coma," said Rona Figueredo, union leader at the Briquetera del Orinoco iron plant in Puerto Ordaz, which shut down its last production line during the blackout.
At least half a dozen other state-run metals plants have ceased operating following the blackout, including the flagship Sidor steel plant, Alcasa and Venalum aluminum plants and three iron smelters, according to workers.
It was the "final nail in the coffin" for the industries that had been operating at single-digit capacities after years of mismanagement, said Damian Prat, a veteran Puerto Ordaz labor activist and author of a book on Venezuelan heavy industries.
The government has blamed electrical problems on what it has described as sabotage directed from the United States, without providing evidence. Government officials also said state-run heavy industries maintained production despite the blackout.
"Without these industries, there can't be economic recuperation in Venezuela," said the author Mr. Prat.

Full text: Stocks finished broadly higher on Friday as Wall Street closed out the first quarter with the market's biggest gain in nearly a decade.
The benchmark S&P 500 index is now up 13.1 percent this year, a drastic turnaround for stocks after a jarring 14 percent sell-off in the last three months of 2018.
The market's blockbuster quarter shared the spotlight with Lyft's much-anticipated trading debut on the Nasdaq stock exchange. The ride-hailing company's shares finished at $78.29, or 8.7 percent above its offering price of $72.
New data pointing to lower inflation and renewed optimism among investors that the trade talks between the U.S. and China are making progress helped drive the rally. Bond yields also continued to rise from recent lows, easing concerns about a steep drop in long-term yields heading into this week.
"Low interest rates, low inflation, possibly better trade, that's enough here to move the market higher," said Mike Baele, senior portfolio manager at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. "It's been some time since we've had some enthusiasm in the I.P.O. market, and that might be helping the markets today as well."
The S&P 500 index gained 18.96 points, or 0.7 percent, to 2,834.40. The index also notched a gain for the week.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 211.22 points, or 0.8 percent, to 25,928.68. The Nasdaq composite added 60.16 points, or 0.8 percent, to 7,729.32. The Russell 2000 index of smaller company stocks picked up 4.63 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,539.74.
The Dow ended the quarter with an 11.2 percent gain, while the Nasdaq is up 16.5 percent. The Russell 2000 is 14.2 percent higher this year.
"As disappointing and perhaps shocking as the sell-off in the fourth quarter was, with the Fed getting out of the way, the rebound has been equally as shocking," Mr. Baele said. "Essentially, we're just back to where we were in October."
Bond yields rose for the second straight day, allaying traders' concerns following a steep drop in long-term yields over the last week. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.41 percent from 2.39 percent late Thursday.
Investors remain anxious about the slowing global economy. Economists believe growth has slowed this year because of weaker growth prospects in China and Europe, the dampening effects on American exports from the Trump administration's trade battles and the waning boost from the 2017 tax cut and government spending.
The more downbeat outlook for economic growth has prompted the Federal Reserve to signal that it plans to keep its benchmark interest rate steady this year.
Technology and health care companies drove much of the market's gains Friday. Shares of Micron Technology rose 5.1 percent and Celgene stock jumped 7.9 percent.
Industrial sector companies notched solid gains as shares in several airlines climbed. American Airlines Group stock gained 2.8 percent, Southwest Airlines stock added 2.9 percent and shares of Delta Air Lines picked up 2.6 percent.
CarMax led all stocks in the S&P 500 with a gain of 9.6 percent after the auto dealership chain's fourth-quarter earnings topped Wall Street's forecasts, even as revenue fell short of expectations.
Shares in RH, the owner of furniture chain Restoration Hardware, slumped 22 percent after the company reported disappointing fourth-quarter revenue. RH's fiscal 2019 outlook also fell well below analysts' expectations.
Energy futures closed mostly higher. Benchmark United States crude oil rose 1.4 percent to settle at $60.14 a barrel. Brent crude, used to price international oils, closed 0.8 percent higher at $68.39 a barrel.
The dollar rose to 110.81 yen from 110.57 yen on Thursday, while the euro weakened to $1.1217 from $1.1221.

Full text: President Trump and his top economic adviser criticized the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate increases again on Friday, blaming the central bank for hindering economic growth while denying any suggestion of a looming slowdown.
Just one day after the Commerce Department said the economy slowed more sharply at the end of last year than previously reported, Mr. Trump blamed the Fed for "mistakenly" raising rates last year.
"Had the Fed not mistakenly raised interest rates, especially since there is very little inflation, and had they not done the ridiculously timed quantitative tightening," Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter on Friday, "the 3.0% GDP, & Stock Market, would have both been much higher & World Markets would be in a better place!"
Larry Kudlow, the director of the White House's National Economic Council, told CNBC on Friday that Mr. Trump would like to see the Fed cut rates by half a percentage point.
"This is our view. This is his view. This is my view," Mr. Kudlow said.
Mr. Trump has made no secret of his disdain for the Fed's recent interest rate increases and its effort to slim down its massive portfolio of government-backed securities. Mr. Trump has blamed the Fed for slowing economic growth and has criticized his handpicked Fed chairman, Jerome H. Powell. After the Fed raised rates in December, Mr. Trump complained to aides that Mr. Powell was going to "turn me into Hoover," a reference to the man who was president in the early years of the Great Depression.
After raising rates for five consecutive quarters, the Fed abruptly changed course this year and said earlier this month that it foresees no additional increases in 2019. Mr. Powell said last week that the Fed would leave interest rates unchanged, as signs of economic weakness in the United States and abroad warrant a more "patient" approach.
He also said that the Fed planned to stop winnowing its portfolio of government bonds, which it amassed in the wake of the financial crisis as it tried to prop up the economy. The Fed will end its efforts to shrink that portfolio, known as quantitative tightening, later this year.
The Fed, along with many outside economists, sees economic growth slowing in 2019 as the effects of Mr. Trump's tax cuts fade and as his trade war and weaker growth in Europe and in China contribute to a slowdown. Mr. Powell told reporters earlier this month that, depending on how economic data played out, the Fed's next move could just as easily be a rate cut as a rate increase.
On Thursday, the Commerce Department revised its growth estimates for 2018, saying the economy -- as measured from the fourth quarter of 2017 to the fourth quarter of 2018 -- stands at 3.0 percent, down a bit from the initially reported 3.1 percent. That is still enough to allow Mr. Trump to claim to have achieved the first year of 3 percent growth since 2005.
Mr. Trump has insisted that economic growth will continue at a rapid clip, but he has also begun to blame the Fed for any slowdown that might occur.
In an interview with Fox Business Network last Friday, Mr. Trump said that the economy would have grown by at least 4 percent "if we didn't have somebody that would raise interest rates and do quantitative tightening."
Mr. Kudlow has struck a slightly less pugilistic tone. In an interview with CNBC, Mr. Kudlow said that the economy "fundamentally" looks "quite healthy," adding that he and Mr. Trump understand that the Fed operates independently.
Mr. Kudlow said Mr. Trump had "redesigned, redeveloped and re-engineered" the economy and suggested the Fed was getting in the way of allowing the president's efforts to take root.
"There's no emergency, just a point of view," Mr. Kudlow said. "We don't want to threaten this great recovery."
While Mr. Powell already seems to be following the trajectory Mr. Trump wants, the president said last week that he plans to nominate Stephen Moore to an open seat on the Fed. Mr. Moore, a former campaign adviser to Mr. Trump and a conservative economist, has been pushing for the Fed to cut interest rates, saying their recent increases went too far. The White House has yet to formally nominate Mr. Moore for the Fed seat.

Data Challenges Trump Optimism On the Economy

Full text: WASHINGTON -- President Trump is getting exactly what he wants on the economy, but it may not last.
The Federal Reserve has abruptly stopped its march toward higher interest rates, as Mr. Trump demanded. The tax cuts he signed in late 2017 are in full swing. His attempt to rewrite the global rules of trade are underway, and he proclaims himself happy with the array of new tariffs he has imposed. His recent comments suggest he is unconcerned about slowdowns in China and Europe, which he considers economic rivals.
But while Mr. Trump points with pride to last year's economic growth and promises even faster growth to come, there are signs that his most dependable talking point is eroding. On Thursday, the Commerce Department issued a downward revision of its estimates for economic growth in the fourth quarter, pushing one measure of the full year's growth down as well.
Forecasters outside the White House, including officials at the Fed, expect growth to slow even more this year. Economic data suggests that slowdown is already underway in the first quarter. Manufacturing is losing some of its steam from last year's rapid growth, and job creation is also moderating. Chief executives of some of the nation's biggest companies see investment, hiring and sales growth all slowing this year. Three-quarters of business economists say they are more worried about growth undershooting their forecasts than overshooting it, and half have revised those forecasts downward for this year.
White House officials see growth staying above 3 percent for the next few years -- and potentially for an entire decade, provided Mr. Trump can continue carrying out his economic agenda, including another round of tax cuts, a $1 trillion infrastructure plan and additional deregulation.
"The economy is roaring," Mr. Trump said on Thursday night at a rally in Grand Rapids, Mich. "Our country has never done better economically."
Mr. Trump's re-election could hinge on whether he is right about the economy, and nearly every other forecaster is wrong. If Mr. Trump is correct and growth surges again, he will enter 2020 with arguably the strongest economic record of any incumbent president facing re-election since Bill Clinton in 1996. But if he is wrong and the economy cools, Mr. Trump will have no one to credibly blame -- and few places to turn for another jolt of stimulus if the United States slides into an economic contraction or recession.
The Democrats who control the House have no desire to pass another round of tax cuts. The Fed, which has slowly raised rates to a range of 2.25 to 2.5 percent, has relatively few tools available to help lift the economy from a sharp downturn. Some Fed officials have begun to warn that they might need to cut interest rates later this year -- further reducing the Fed's ammunition to fight a recession -- if growth disappoints.
"At the moment, the risks from the downside scenarios loom larger than those from the upside ones," Charles Evans, the president of the Chicago Fed, said Monday in Hong Kong. "If activity softens more than expected or if inflation and inflation expectations run too low, then policy may have to be left on hold -- or perhaps even loosened."
Last week Mr. Trump again raised his bet on his ability to fuel a continuing boom in growth. He said he would nominate Stephen Moore, an architect of his campaign economic platform and a fellow critic of the Fed's recent interest rate increases, to a seat on the Fed's board of governors. If confirmed, Mr. Moore would become the first unabashed Trump loyalist on the board, and he would press officials to reduce rates in hopes of pushing annual growth to 4 percent.
On Thursday, the Commerce Department said the economy slowed more sharply at the end of last year than previously reported, revising its estimate of fourth-quarter growth to 2.2 percent from 2.6 percent because of weaker spending by consumers and state and local governments, among other factors.
Growth for the full year -- as measured from the fourth quarter of 2017 to the fourth quarter of 2018 -- stands at 3.0 percent, down a bit from the initially reported 3.1 percent but still enough to allow Mr. Trump to claim to have achieved the first year of 3 percent growth since 2005. (That claim is somewhat misleading. Year-over-year growth has topped 3 percent several times in recent years, but not in the fourth quarter. An alternative measure of full-year growth for 2018, based on comparing calendar-year averages, was unrevised at 2.9 percent.)
While Mr. Trump continues to predict robust growth, he is already trying to pin blame for any slowdown on the Fed, rather than any of his own policies.
"We're doing a good job," he said in an interview last week on Fox Business Network. "And I think we have tremendous momentum right now. And you're right, the world is slowing, but we're not slowing."
He added that, "if we didn't have somebody that would raise interest rates and do quantitative tightening," we would have been at over 4 percent growth.
Fifty-six percent of Americans approve of Mr. Trump's handling of the economy, Gallup reports, the highest mark of his term and the best for a president since Barack Obama registered the same rating in March 2009. Surveys of consumer confidence remain strong, including a confidence index conducted for The New York Times by the online research firm SurveyMonkey, which has gained strength since Mr. Trump took office.
Unemployment has dipped to 3.8 percent. Inflation remains subdued, and wage growth is accelerating.
White House economists say the tax cuts Mr. Trump signed in 2017, for businesses and individuals, deserve much of the credit for the economy's performance -- and that they will deliver another strong year of investment and hiring in 2019.
"Some folks have said that, 'Oh, sure, we did have 3 percent growth, but that was a sugar high,"' Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said last week.
"And our view is that it's really not a sugar high at all," he continued. "A sugar high would be: We spent a lot of money on Twinkies and now we are sorry we ate all those Twinkies, and we don't have money left. But this is -- we actually cut taxes to encourage people to build new factories. And we had new factories last year. We're going to get more new factories this year, but we're also going to get the output from the factories we built last year as they turn them on."
Outside economists are more pessimistic, citing drags on growth from Mr. Trump's trade policies, slowdowns abroad and a fading consumer spending boost from the tax cuts. Fed officials said this week that their median prediction is now for 2.1 percent growth for the year. Their projections also foresee no interest rate increases in 2019 -- down from a forecast of two in December and in line with Mr. Trump's desire to halt rate increases -- and officials announced they would end the reduction of their asset purchase program sooner than markets had expected.
"I don't believe there's a lot of room for criticism if you believe the Fed should be easy this year -- they are," said Ellen Zentner, chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley. "The Fed has completely removed themselves from the equation, both in their rates path and their balance sheet."
Ms. Zentner forecasts 1.7 percent growth this year, largely as a result of slowing investment growth. That would mark a return to the Obama-era growth levels that Mr. Trump has said are now over.
Mr. Trump could possibly influence the growth path on his own this year, positively or negatively. He could reach a trade agreement with China, bolstering business certainty and removing tariffs that have hurt American companies and consumers. He could also end tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, which have raised prices for companies that use foreign metals in their products.
But Mr. Trump has also threatened to impose new tariffs on imported automobiles and auto parts from Europe and Japan, a move that economists, companies and lawmakers from both parties warn would be economically devastating to the auto industry and its customers.
He has negotiated a new trade agreement with Canada and Mexico, but he needs Congress to approve it. Its fate is uncertain. He does not appear to be aggressively pushing for Congress to pass a large-scale infrastructure plan, though he has called for one, and a divided Congress is unlikely to approve one even if he did.
A question mark could be government spending. Last year, Mr. Trump signed an agreement between Republicans and Democrats that increased defense and other domestic spending, which helped stimulate demand and growth in the economy. In his budget this year, Mr. Trump called for additional defense increases but cuts in domestic spending, which Democrats are certain to oppose.
Complicating the conversation is the widening federal budget deficit, which hit a monthly record in February, according to the Treasury Department, and which the Trump administration predicts will soon top $1 trillion a year. The deficit has ballooned, even in a time of relatively rapid growth, because Mr. Trump's tax cuts reduced tax revenues -- both in absolute terms and compared with forecasts -- and because of the spending increases he approved.
It is unusual, historically, for presidents to pour fiscal stimulus onto an economy with already low unemployment. The decision to do so could tie Mr. Trump's hands in a dire situation that most economists deem possible but unlikely -- an economic contraction or recession this year.
Democrats will be in no mood to give Mr. Trump another tax cut, in that case. The Fed could cut rates, but not by as much as it did in previous recessions. To combat each of the last three recessions, the Fed cut rates by at least five percentage points.
Today, the Fed's target interest rate sits between 2.25 and 2.5 percent. It does not appear to be rising anytime soon.
That's just how Mr. Trump wants it.

Full text: ISTANBUL -- Turkey's banking regulator has announced that it will begin an inquiry into JPMorgan Chase for providing "misleading and manipulative" investment advice that, it said, prompted a run on the Turkish lira last week.
The Banking Regulation and Supervision Board issued a statement saying it had received a large number of complaints about a JPMorgan research report to clients on Friday that "caused volatility in the financial markets and loss of reputation and value especially for the banks of our country."
The lira, which has been slipping in value over the last year, slumped more than 5 percent on Friday, dropping in value to 5.7 to the United States dollar from 5.4, while Turkey's main stock exchange fell 3.45 percent.
The board said its investigation would also look into activities of other banks, but it did not name them.
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has frequently accused foreign powers of orchestrating the currency crisis, and at a huge campaign rally in Istanbul on Sunday, he accused unnamed actors in the financial sector of trying to provoke a run on the lira.
"We all know who you are, we all know what you are all doing," he said. "You should know that after the elections, we will make you to pay a heavy price. You would not be able to exploit this nation. You would not be able to cheat this nation."
Economists, though, say a loss of confidence in the management of the economy and rule of law in Turkey is behind the weakening of the lira.
It is unclear how the inquiry will progress or what penalties could be imposed, but the board said it would undertake "necessary administrative and legal proceedings." In a related announcement, the Capital Markets Board of Turkey said it was conducting its own investigation into JPMorgan over the same report.
JPMorgan analysts warned in the report that the Turkish lira might depreciate soon after local elections scheduled for Sunday. A spokesman for JPMorgan declined to comment.
In a sign of its concern at the renewed volatility in financial markets, Turkey's Central Bank announced on Friday that it would suspend one-week repo auctions -- closing the spigot on one source of cash for banks -- for a period of time, which analysts called an unusual move.
Turkey has experienced severe economic pressures over the last year, and government figures released this month showed that the country had entered a recession, defined as two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth. The lira lost 28 percent of its value last year as foreign investment stalled amid soaring private sector debt.
Mr. Erdogan, who has assumed increased powers since winning re-election last summer, announced that he would take on greater responsibility for the economy and even decisions at the Central Bank. He appointed Berat Albayrak, his son-in-law, minister of finance and Treasury.
Mr. Albayrak said in a television interview on Friday that Turkey had already resolved its most pressing vulnerabilities: inflation and budget discipline. "A healthy environment that would provide security for international markets has settled in Turkey," he said, promising a period of reform over the rest of Mr. Erdogan's five-year term. "Our way is open. We are very comfortable."
Even as inflation and unemployment figures have risen sharply, Mr. Erdogan has been undeterred, personally leading two or three rallies around the country a day for his Justice and Development Party. The election campaign has been especially nasty, with mudslinging and lawsuits leveled at candidates as polls show a close race in some of the most important cities, including the capital, Ankara.
At the campaign rally on Sunday, Mr. Erdogan vowed to fight outside influences trying to weaken the economy.
"Beware, folks, do not take their words for it," he said. "We will protect our money. Our money is the Turkish lira. We will protect it. We will not rise to the bait. And we will make them pay the price."

Trump's Kakistocracy Is Also a Hackistocracy

Full text: It's no secret that Donald Trump has appointed a lot of partisan, unqualified hacks to key policy positions. A few months ago my colleague Gail Collins asked readers to help her select Trump's worst cabinet member. It was a hard choice, because there were so many qualified applicants.
The winner, by the way, was Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary. That looks like an even better call now: Ross's department has reportedly prepared a report declaring that imports of European cars threaten U.S. national security. This is both ludicrous and dangerous. It gives Trump the right to start a new phase in his trade war that would inflict severe economic damage while alienating our allies -- and, as a result, undermine national security.
Until recently, however, one agency had seemed immune to the continuing hack invasion: the Federal Reserve, the single institution most crucial to economic policymaking. Trump's Fed nominees, have, by and large, been sensible, respected economists. But that all changed last week, when Trump said he planned to nominate Stephen Moore for the Fed's Board of Governors.
Moore is manifestly, flamboyantly unqualified for the position. But there's a story here that goes deeper than Moore, or even Trump; it's about the whole G.O.P.'s preference for hucksters over experts, even partisan experts.
About Moore: It goes almost without saying that he has been wrong about everything. I don't mean the occasional bad call, which all of us make. I mean a track record that includes predicting that George W. Bush's policies would produce a magnificent boom, Barack Obama's policies would lead to runaway inflation, tax cuts in Kansas would produce a "near immediate" boost to the state's economy, and much more. And, of course, never an acknowledgment of error or reflection on why he got it wrong.
[For an even deeper look at what's on Paul Krugman's mind, sign up for his weekly newsletter.]
Beyond that, Moore has a problem with facts. After printing a Moore op-ed in which all the key numbers were wrong, one editor vowed never to publish the man's work again. And a blizzard of factual errors is standard practice in his writing and speaking. It's actually hard to find cases where Moore got a fact right.
Yet Moore isn't some random guy who caught Trump's eye. He has long been a prominent figure in the conservative movement: a writer for the Wall Street Journal editorial page, chief economist of the Heritage Foundation, a fixture on the right-wing lecture circuit. Why?
You might say that the G.O.P. values partisan loyalty above professional competence. But that's only a partial explanation, because there are plenty of conservative economists with solid professional credentials -- and some of them are pretty naked in their partisanship, too. Thus, a who's who of well-known conservative economists rushed to endorse the Trump administration's outlandish claims about the benefits from its tax cut, claims they knew full well were unreasonable.
Nor has their partisanship been restrained and polite. Many of us are still mourning the death of Alan Krueger, the Princeton economist best known for research -- since vindicated by many other studies -- showing that increases in the minimum wage don't usually seem to reduce employment. Well, the Nobel-winning conservative economist James Buchanan denounced those pursuing that line of research as "a bevy of camp-following whores."
So conservatives could, if they wanted, turn for advice to highly partisan economists with at least some idea of what they're doing. Yet these economists, despite what often seem like pathetic attempts to curry favor with politicians, are routinely passed over for key positions, which go to almost surreally unqualified figures like Moore or Larry Kudlow, the Trump administration's chief economist.
Many people have described the Trump administration as a kakistocracy -- rule by the worst -- which it is. But it's also a hackistocracy -- rule by the ignorant and incompetent. And in this Trump is just following standard G.O.P. practice.
Why do hacks rule on the right? It may simply be that a party of apparatchiks feels uncomfortable with people who have any real expertise or independent reputation, no matter how loyal they may seem. After all, you never know when they might take a stand on principle.
In any case, there will eventually be a price to pay. True, there is, wrote Adam Smith, "a great deal of ruin in a nation." America isn't just an immensely powerful, wealthy, technologically advanced, peaceful country. We're also a nation with a long tradition of dedicated public service.
Even now -- as I can attest from personal interactions -- a great majority of those working for the Treasury Department, the State Department and so on are competent, hard-working people trying to do the best they can for their country.
But as top jobs systematically go to hacks, there is an inevitable process of corrosion. We're already seeing a degradation of the way our government responds to things like natural disasters. Well, there will be more and bigger disasters ahead. And the people in charge of dealing with those disasters will be the worst of the worst.

Full text: Loyalty programs weren't around when the ancient Greek philosopher Heraclitus opined that the only constant in life is change. But the shifting earn-and-burn point levels established by hotel, airline and credit card programs add head-spinning haste to his thesis, especially in the past year.
In short, there are more ways to earn and spend as both sides of the loyalty equation -- awards and rewards -- inflate.
"Every loyalty point you hold today will be less valuable in two to five years," said Leigh Rowan, the special projects director at UpgradedPoints.com, a website covering loyalty rewards strategies. "That's the way airlines, hotels and private equity companies earn money, and they're getting creative in how you can spend them."
Some estimates put the value of unredeemed points in the United States and Canada at $100 billion. If you're sitting on piles of points, now is the time to consider using them, as programs offer new incentives in travel and beyond.
Hotels expand, and expand point spending
From Marriott International's acquisition of Starwood Hotels & Resorts in 2016 to Hyatt Hotels' recent purchase of Two Roads Hospitality, hotel companies are consolidating, dragging their membership programs into the unions. These marriages offer more places for members to redeem their points and new encouragement to do so.
"In general, the programs are rewarding people who stay at hotels more than ever before, the 'heads in beds' as they call it," said Brian Kelly, founder of ThePointsGuy.com site, which is devoted to maximizing travel points.
In April, Wyndham Rewards from Wyndham Hotels & Resorts will incorporate the points program from its formerly separate La Quinta brand, and lower the entry-level redemption price for a hotel room from 15,000 points to 7,500. The program continues to reward 10 points per dollar spent or a minimum of 1,000 points, whichever is greater, at more than 8,000 hotels. It will also offer points-plus-cash plans, called Go Fast, starting at 1,500 points.
"Our core tenet is simplicity," said Eliot Hamlisch, the senior vice president of global loyalty and partnerships at Wyndham, noting that the new plan moves from flat-rate redemption to one that disperses rewards more quickly. "Now members may only stay one night and have enough for a discounted stay on the next day."
Marriott International just rolled out its new Marriott Bonvoy loyalty program, replacing three previous programs: Marriott Rewards, Starwood Preferred Guest and Ritz-Carlton Rewards. The company says 70 percent of stays are at the same cost or less and members are now given elite status more quickly. Members now have access to rooms at 6,900 hotels across 29 brands.
"Loyalty programs have only increased over the last five to 10 years in the industry and certainly at Marriott. We now fill half of our rooms with guests in the loyalty program," said David Flueck, the senior vice president of global loyalty at Marriott.
In a give-and-take move, the company has banished blackout dates for point redemption, but has announced it will introduce peak and off-peak pricing this year.
In November, Hyatt Hotels forged an alliance with Small Luxury Hotels of the World, allowing members of its World of Hyatt loyalty program to earn and redeem points at participating S.L.H. properties, now at 110. Last fall, it added Exhale, the spa and fitness brand that Hyatt acquired in 2017, to its World of Hyatt loyalty program, offering 10 points for every dollar spent at Exhale.
Hyatt also recently acquired Two Roads Hospitality and its five brands including Alila, Joie de Vivre and Thompson, which are expected to join the loyalty program in the future.
A free night, or red carpet at the Oscars?
Instead of redeeming 360,000 Hilton Honors points for a few nights in the Maldives, Mr. Kelly, the Points Guy, recently spent them to take a friend to a private event honoring Dolly Parton.
"I'm officially the best friend ever," he joked.
Hilton isn't in the music business, but like other hotel chains it has started offering unique and often priceless experiences to spend points on in addition to free stays. The company says it increased the number of these experiences by 166 percent last year over 2017.
"Airlines and hotels have issued a lot of these currencies and want to find creative ways to get them off their books," Mr. Rowan of UpgradedPoints said, noting that travel companies can leverage the sponsorships they have with sports teams and stars to offer V.I.P. access to loyalty members. "It's the experience of meeting a chef or rock star that they're banking you'll pay for and won't have a chance to do again."
In addition to aspirational options for the point-rich -- like driving a Formula 1 racecar in Singapore for 1.3 million points or a four-night stay in Lake Como for 2 million -- Hilton Honors launched Lawn Days last summer. The concert program, designed to appeal to more casual travelers, offers a pair of lawn tickets to dozens of concerts throughout the country for 10,000 points. Last year, 95 percent of redeemers were first-time users of their points, according to Hilton.
Starwood Preferred Guest is credited with pioneering the practice of offering experiences for points, a legacy Marriott has expanded on with its auction platform, Marriott Bonvoy Moments. Members can bid on the chance to stand in the player's tunnel with Manchester United soccer players before a match or rub elbows with members of Maroon 5, among other experiences.
World of Hyatt introduced its experience platform, Find, last summer, now offering more than 100 options such as hiking with wolves in California (21,429 points), a bonsai class with a professional bonsai designer (10,714 points) and a noodle tour in Cambodia with the chef of the Park Hyatt Siem Reap (7,071 points).
Airlines are also adding experience rewards. United MileagePlus is offering tickets to an Ariana Grande concert (about 16,300 miles) and "Wicked" on Broadway (from 14,000 miles). At Delta SkyMiles Experiences, members could recently use SkyMiles to attend Yankees spring training games (5,000 miles) or bid on a kitchen tour and dinner for two at the French Laundry in Napa Valley, Calif. (starting at 40,000 miles).
Rewards for the infrequent traveler, too
Loyalty programs, of course, favor the most frequent travelers. But entry-level perks, including discounted rates and free internet access, make them worthwhile for occasional travelers as well.
"We're making sure the program is relevant for elite travelers with the richest benefits, but we're also offering free Wi-Fi and special member rates on our website and those are things that appeal to infrequent travelers," Marriott's Mr. Flueck said.
Entry-level perks represent early steps in cultivating loyalty. IHG Hotels & Resorts, parent of InterContinental and Holiday Inn brands, says it now has more than 100 million members in its IHG Rewards Club and that loyalty members are seven times more likely to book directly with the hotel company -- saving fees that otherwise go to middlemen -- and stay 20 percent longer than nonmembers.
At its basic membership level, guests get free Wi-Fi and rates up to 5 percent off when booked at the hotel's website, as well as access to special sales.
For the past two years, Hilton Honors has offered points pooling to its nearly 82 million members, allowing family or friends to combine their points and put them toward a trip. Basic membership includes lower rates when booked directly and the use of the Hilton Honors app to check in, choose a room or order extra pillows.
Airlines tighten their belts
Airline programs are notorious for raising thresholds for redemptions and in some cases inflating membership minimums.
"Airlines have led the pack in increasing the amount of miles needed for rewards," Mr. Kelly said. "There's a constantly moving goal-post."
This year, American's AAdvantage program and United's MileagePlus announced they will raise the threshold for top-tier status to $15,000 spent in qualifying dollars from $12,000 (qualifying dollars depend on the fare paid; some sale fares may earn fewer points than full-priced fares).
American's mixed bag of changes includes now offering a point per mile spent on tickets with its foreign partners such as British Airways and Japan Airlines. But the carrier is also reducing points earned for many of its own economy flights from 1.5 per mile to one per mile.
In 2019, United is also knocking back its reward rate on some economy tickets, to 1.5 per mile from two per mile.
For elite Delta SkyMiles holders, one key benefit was just yanked. Delta limited access to its Delta Sky Club airport lounges to qualifying members flying Delta that day; previously elite level fliers could use the lounges even if they were flying on a competitor.
Last spring, Southwest Airlines announced that the cheapest fares redeemed with its Rapid Rewards points would cost about 6 percent more in points, but that its more expensive refundable Anytime fares would cost about 22 percent less.
As these points usually lose value each year, experts warn against hoarding.
"Don't hold onto these points," Mr. Rowan said. "Spend how it makes sense to you, feel good about it and don't look back."
Credit cards for travelers
Most hotels and airlines also have branded credit cards that can offer entry level perks, like a free night or early boarding on flights. Many competing bank cards also reward points that can be transferred to travel partners for free nights and flights.
"There's this massive rewards race with credit cards," Mr. Kelly said. "If you're paying with cash, you're leaving money on the table."
New credit card offers are rampant, including aboard American Airlines flights where flight attendants recently passed out credit card applications offering 50,000 points -- enough for a round-trip ticket to Europe -- after spending $2,500 within three months.
Hotels.com, an online travel agency that offers discount hotel bookings, recently launched a credit card partnership with Capitol One Venture and VentureOne cards that gives 10 points per dollar spent on bookings through the website.
Still, most points hawks recommend using a credit card that allows points transfers as a hedge against redemption inflation.
"Points that are transferable are resistant to devaluation," said Alex Miller, the chief executive and founder of UpgradedPoints.com. "If you only have American miles, they can devalue overnight. If you're collecting Chase points and can use one of 13 airline and hotel transfer partners, you have more options and when one devalues, you can transfer to others."
______
A cheat sheet on taking advantage of loyalty programs
â  Join the program of any hotel you may book. There is no fee, and basic membership usually offers rate discounts and freebies like Wi-Fi to members.
â  When it comes to redeeming hotel points, even if you have a low balance, look for cash-plus-points offers or programs like Hilton Honors that allow you to pool points with friends or family.
â  Join the frequent-flier programs of every airline you fly, whether frequently or not. Even low-points balances can be used for shopping programs. For free flights faster, consider an airline-branded credit card to add to the point balance and to gain perks like early boarding.
â  If you do accrue a balance that's the equivalent of a free ticket, spend those points before they lose value.
â  For most flexibility in travel, look for credit cards with travel rewards that allow holders to transfer their balances to many airlines and hotel companies.

Full text: Classic Stage Company announced Wednesday that its artistic director, the Tony Award-winning John Doyle, will helm a production of Stephen Sondheim and John Weidman's musical "Assassins" to close the company's 2019-20 season.
Mr. Doyle is no stranger to Mr. Sondheim and Mr. Weidman. He directed a well-received production of the duo's "Pacific Overtures" at Classic Stage in 2017 and, in 2008, a production of their "Road Show" at the Public Theater. "Assassins," a somewhat improbably beloved show about the men and women who have successfully or unsuccessfully attempted to assassinate United States presidents, is the only one of Mr. Sondheim and Mr. Weidman's three musicals that Mr. Doyle hasn't yet directed Off Broadway. The Classic Stage production is slated to begin performances in April 2020.
Opening Classic Stage's season will be another well-known theater work that deals with the killing of rulers: "Macbeth," also directed by Mr. Doyle. Performances are to start in October.
[Check out our Culture Calendar here.]
In between "Macbeth" and "Assassins," Classic Stage will round out its new season with a pair of major works of gothic horror: "Dracula" and "Frankenstein." Versions of those two tales, based on the novels by Bram Stoker and Mary Shelley, will be staged in repertory at the beginning of 2020.

Fed Downgrades Forecast, Leaving Rates Unchanged

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve said Wednesday that the United States economy was slowing more than it had previously thought and painted a far less rosy economic picture than the White House as it left interest rates unchanged and signaled little appetite for raising them again in the near future.
Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chairman, said the economy "is in a good place" in a news conference. But he and his colleagues said growth appeared to be slowing from last year, under the weight of the Trump administration's trade war, economic slowdowns in Europe and China and fading stimulus from the Republican tax cuts of 2017.
The Fed now expects 2.1 percent growth this year, down from the 2.3 percent it forecast in December -- and more than a percentage point less than the 3.2 percent growth the White House predicts. The outlook for 2020 is even more bleak, with the Fed now projecting growth of just 1.9 percent.
The downbeat assessment comes as the Fed sees signs of weakness in areas like consumer spending and business investment, which Mr. Powell said "suggest that growth is slowing somewhat more than expected." Average monthly job growth, while strong, "appears to have stepped down from last year's strong pace," he added.
Mr. Powell tried to reassure markets by saying "economical fundamentals are still very strong," but he acknowledged that recent developments both domestically and abroad were making it harder for the American economy to grow as quickly as it did last year.
"We see a situation where the European economy has slowed substantially," he said, adding that China's economy has also weakened.
Forecasts released at the end of the two-day meeting show the typical member of the Federal Open Market Committee now expects not to raise rates at all this year, an abrupt halt to what had been five consecutive quarters of rate increases to the current range of 2.25 to 2.5 percent. Most officials now expect a single rate increase in 2020 and none in 2021. In December, when forecasts were last released, Fed officials said they expected two rate increases this year and another in 2020.
Mr. Powell showed little concern about inflation -- which has stayed below the Fed's 2 percent target -- rising to levels that would trigger an immediate rate increase in order to prevent a rapid escalation of prices across the economy.
Instead, Mr. Powell did not rule out the possibility -- based on the current condition of the economy -- that the central bank's next move could be a rate cut. "The data are not currently sending a signal that we need to move in one direction or another," he said.
By signaling it will not raise rates without a clear change in conditions, the Fed is effectively giving Mr. Trump what he wants from monetary policy, but with a twist. The president has publicly pushed Mr. Powell to stop raising rates. But if the Fed is correct and growth falls well below 3 percent this year, without a single rate increase, it will be difficult for Mr. Trump to pin the blame on Mr. Powell.
The 1.9 percent growth the Fed now expects in 2020 is down from a 2 percent forecast in December. But the projections include even worse possibilities: At least one committee member forecasts growth of only 1.6 percent for 2019. In December, the lowest forecast was 2 percent for the year.
White House officials see growth staying above 3 percent for the next few years, provided Mr. Trump can continue implementing his economic agenda, including another round of tax cuts, a $1 trillion infrastructure plan and additional deregulation.
Most private forecasters' growth predictions for this year run closer to the Fed's than the White House's. That includes the chief executives of the Business Roundtable, who said in a quarterly survey released Wednesday that their expectations for sales, hiring and investment fell at the start of the year. They predict the economy will grow 2.5 percent in 2019.
The gap between White House and Fed forecasts has never been wider in the years since the Great Recession ended in 2009. The two outlooks have clashed in the past -- during the terms of Presidents George Bush and George W. Bush -- for fundamental reasons, said Diane Swonk, the chief economist at Grant Thornton.
"One is a forecast that is meant to be as accurate as possible and produce the best monetary policy outcomes," Ms. Swonk said. "The other is a forecast that can't escape political and ideological desires."
The diverging forecasts underscore the differences in how the administration and the Fed judge both the risks to economic growth this year and the evidence that Mr. Trump's tax cuts have fundamentally strengthened the economy.
Administration officials insist that the $1.5 trillion tax cut will continue to accelerate business investment and draw more and more workers into the labor force, accelerating growth. Mr. Trump promoted his economic plan in Lima, Ohio, on Wednesday, saying it would produce record job and wage growth.
"We just came out, another chart, we just came out with numbers, the economic report of the president, 3.1 percent G.D.P., the first time in 14 years," Mr. Trump said, referring to data showing economic output rose 3.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018 from a year earlier. While the Fed expressed concern that Mr. Trump's trade policies could drag down growth, the president said his tariffs on imported metals and Chinese goods were bringing jobs back to America.
"Everyone said you couldn't do it, you couldn't bring back manufacturing jobs," he said. "You would need a magic wand. We are bringing them back beyond anybody's expectations."
Mr. Powell said on Wednesday that it was difficult to discern the law's permanent effects on the supply of workers and productivity.
"We hope they're very large," he said.
Asked about the Fed's deviation from the White House's economic growth projections that were released on Tuesday, Mr. Powell said he had not seen those numbers.
"The Fed underscored patience and a strong desire to allow inflation to run above target," researchers at Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in a research note. "As Powell said in his opening remarks, the Fed's overarching goal is to sustain the economic expansion. This unprecedented dovish turn clearly shows such commitment."
Yields on the 10-year Treasury note -- a bellwether for a range of consumer borrowing rates -- dropped sharply after the Fed statement was released as investors digested the potential that the Fed could be done raising rates for some time. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 2.52 percent -- its lowest level since January 2018. Stocks, which had been negative for most of the day, rallied and briefly regained positive territory after the announcement. However, they lost steam in the last hour of trading, and the S&P 500 closed down 0.3 percent.
Analysts had been expecting the Fed to shift its forecasts at the meeting, but not by this much.
Eleven committee members said they do not expect any rate increases this year. Four said they expected one. None expected a rate cut. In 2020, a majority of members expected at least one rate increase, although some expected none.
Fed officials also announced that they would end an effort to slim the central bank's massive holdings of government-backed securities in September, after slowing it down in May. The Fed accumulated $4.5 trillion worth of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities in an effort to stimulate the economy after the Great Recession. It has been slowly winnowing those holdings as the economy has recovered.
Many analysts had expected officials to announce the September end of the balance sheet wind-down, which Mr. Powell had foreshadowed in a recent speech at Stanford University. By October, the Fed said on Wednesday, officials will be shifting the composition of the balance sheet, moving out of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities and into primarily Treasury bonds.
Officials appeared to hasten to end the balance sheet reduction under pressure from financial markets. Many analysts blamed stock market volatility in December and January on the Fed's wind-down process.
In announcing the end of the reduction, Fed officials acknowledged that they were stopping short of what many analysts had expected when the reduction began. They said the total holdings on the balance sheet once the wind-down ends "will likely still be somewhat above the level of reserves necessary to efficiently and effectively implement monetary policy."
Carrying a larger-than-expected balance sheet -- and operating with interest rates at what remain historically low levels -- could hinder the Fed in battling an economic downturn in the near future.

Full text: Yes, of course, we need a Green New Deal to address the world's most urgent crisis, global warming.
Just, please, not the one that a flotilla of liberal politicians, including seven of the top Democratic presidential hopefuls currently in the Senate, are signing up for in droves, like children following the pied piper in the old legend.
Our modern-day pied piper, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, is trying to lure us into a set of policies that might help save the planet but at the cost of severely damaging the global economy.
To be sure, by the time the resolution was introduced into Congress, some of its most ludicrous provisions (like the deadline of 2030 for a full transition to renewable energy and the immediate halt to any investment in fossil fuels) had been eliminated or watered down.
But as important as continuing to prune the absurd or damaging provisions would be to add what is the most effective way to attack climate change: using taxes and market forces rather than government controls to reduce harmful emissions.
That has been a problem for decades, at least since Washington got seriously into the business of improving the environment, back in 1970 with the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency -- under President Richard Nixon!
Politicians prefer that approach because using regulation hides the costs of reducing emissions. The decision, for example, to force improvements in automobile mileage by requiring each manufacturer to improve overall fleet efficiency has added thousands of dollars to the cost of cars.
Higher car prices have the countervailing impact of encouraging Americans to hang onto their older, less fuel-efficient cars for a longer time, offsetting at least some of the gains from newer cars. Nor have the regulations, with their many escape hatches, kept consumers from buying even more sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks as gas prices have remained historically low.
Fortunately, there is a better way to address the climate problem at far lower cost to the economy: a tax on greenhouse gas emissions. That can be imposed in any number of ways. The 18.4 cent federal gasoline tax, for example, hasn't been increased since 1993 even as most other developed countries impose far higher levies.
A particularly thoughtful proposal has come from the Climate Leadership Council, a bipartisan organization that counts more than 3,300 economists among its signatories. Elegant in its simplicity, the key provision would be the imposition of an escalating tax on carbon. At an initial rate of $43 per ton, the levy would be roughly equivalent to 38.2 cents per gallon of gasoline.
To prevent polluters from fleeing overseas, the tax would be imposed on imports from countries lacking a similar provision while exports to those countries would not be taxed. While difficult to implement, that component is important to work out.
The entire proceeds from the tax would be rebated to consumers. The council suggests an equal amount for each American; my view would be to exclude the wealthy (who hardly need the estimated $2,000 a year in payments) and disproportionately favor those closer to the bottom.
Why are so many economists, even conservative ones, in favor of a massive new tax? Because markets do not always price in "externalities" like pollution. In addition to cutting consumption, raising the price of carbon would arguably do more to encourage development of alternative power sources than all the massive new government spending programs that advocates of the Green New Deal envision.
Some technical problems would need to be addressed, such as how the higher prices would filter through inflation calculations and create unintended cost of living adjustments to wages and Social Security payments.
But those are details; the key point is that a carbon tax has been judged by climate hawks like Resources for the Future to be far more effective in reaching the goals of the Paris agreement than the well-intended regulations put in place by President Barack Obama and his predecessors.
That's at least part of why the plan enjoys support from an armada of organizations not often on the same page, like Exxon Mobil and Conservation International.
Historically, the politics of even small increases in the gasoline tax have been tough. A 2017 proposal in the House to increase tax by just one penny went nowhere. But recent polls suggest that perhaps sentiment is changing; a survey by the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago found that 44 percent of Americans favor a carbon tax while only 29 percent oppose one.
Given how late we are to the climate battle, maintaining some sensible regulation will also be necessary. But a hefty carbon tax would go a long way toward winning the war.

Full text: U.S. stock indexes closed mostly lower Tuesday after a late-afternoon splash of selling erased early gains, ending a weeklong rally.
Banks accounted for much of the decline, along with utilities and industrial companies. Those losses offset gains in health care, technology and consumer products stocks.
The benchmark S&P 500 ended barely lower, its second loss over the past seven trading days. It's still up 13 percent so far in 2019.
Investors were looking ahead to what the Federal Reserve will say Wednesday following a two-day meeting of policymakers. The central bank has signaled that it will be "patient" in raising interest rates.
Investors seem reassured that the Fed will continue to hold off on raising rates, and that's given them more confidence to push the market higher this year.
"Typically, markets tend to be flat in front of the Fed, usually we're in a wait-and-see mode," said Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones.
The S&P 500 index slipped 0.37 points, or 0.01 percent, to 2,832.57. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 26.72 points, or 0.1 percent, to 25,887.38.
The Nasdaq composite gained 9.47 points, or 0.1 percent, to 7,723.95. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks gave up 8.95 points, or 0.6 percent, to 1,554.99.
More stocks fell than rose on the New York Stock Exchange. Major indexes in Europe finished higher.
The broader market broke out of a short slump last week and has been gaining since then. It marks a turnaround from a terrifying drop in December, and now every major U.S. index is up more than 10 percent for the year.
What the Fed does next will surely have an impact on the market's trajectory.
The central bank is expected to leave its key short-term interest rate unchanged Wednesday and to stress its new watchword -- "patient"-- in conveying its intention to leave rates alone for the foreseeable future.
The Fed has made clear that with a dimmer economic picture in both the United States and globally, it no longer sees the need to keep raising rates as it did four times in 2018. Among the key factors, besides slower growth, are President Donald Trump's trade war with China, continually low inflation levels and Prime Minister Theresa May's struggle to execute Britain's exit from the European Union.
Signs of a modest economic slowdown, such as a weak factory orders report on Tuesday, may help keep the Fed patient and on hold for a longer amount of time, said Warne.
"It's a slightly bad-news-is-good-news situation," she said.
There has also been an absence of sharp bad news surprises, she said, which has given investors confidence that there is less volatility than previously feared.
Financial, utilities and industrial stocks weighed the most on the market Tuesday. Fifth Third Bancorp dropped 3.3 percent, FirstEnergy slid 2 percent and railroad operator Union Pacific lost 3.3 percent.
Companies that reported disappointing quarterly results also fell.
DSW dropped 12.9 percent after the footwear retailer surprised investors with a loss during the fourth quarter. The company swung to a loss of 7 cents per share, while Wall Street anticipated 4 cents per share in profit. Expenses jumped during the quarter and DSW had to deal with a hefty charge.
Tilray slid 3.4 percent after the medical cannabis company reported a wider loss for the fourth-quarter than Wall Street analysts expected.
Health care stocks, technology companies and retailers notched some of the biggest gains Tuesday.
DaVita led the health sector higher, climbing 3.5 percent. Cigna added 3.4 percent. Chipmakers also posted solid gains. Advanced Micro Devices vaulted 11.8 percent and Nvidia climbed 4 percent. Retailer L Brands added 2.7 percent.
Traders bid up shares in Michaels, rewarding a better-than-expected fourth quarter and overlooking a weak forecast. The arts and crafts retailer has been reassessing its operations, moving to expand its children's offerings and shuttering its Pat Catan craft stores.
The company also changed leadership earlier this month, with CEO Chuck Rubin stepping down and longtime retail executive Mark Cosby taking over as interim CEO. The stock jumped 10 percent.
Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 2.62 percent from 2.60 late Monday.
The dollar held steady at 111.41 Japanese yen. The euro strengthened to $1.1352 from $1.1338 on Monday.
Benchmark U.S. crude oil slipped 0.1 percent to settle at $59.03 a barrel, while Brent crude gained 0.1 percent to close at $67.61 a barrel.
Wholesale gasoline climbed 0.5 percent to $1.89 a gallon, heating oil added 1.1 percent to $1.99 a gallon and natural gas picked up 0.8 percent to $2.87 per 1,000 cubic feet.
Gold rose 0.4 percent to $1,306.50 an ounce, silver added 0.3 percent to $15.37 an ounce and copper picked up 0.5 percent to $2.92 a pound.

Full text: Yansnier Arias knew it was wrong. It violated the Constitution, not to mention the oath he took as a doctor in Cuba.
He had been sent to Venezuela by the Cuban government, one of thousands of doctors deployed to shore up ties between the two allies and alleviate Venezuela's collapsing medical system.
But with President NicolÃ¡s Maduro's re-election on the line, not everyone was allowed to be treated, Dr. Arias said.
A 65-year-old patient with heart failure entered his clinic -- and urgently needed oxygen, he said. The tanks sat in another room at the ready, he recalled.
But he said his Cuban and Venezuelan superiors told him to use the oxygen as a political weapon instead: Not for medical emergencies that day, but to be doled out closer to the election, part of a national strategy to compel patients to vote for the government.
May 20, 2018, was nearing, he said, and the message was clear: Mr. Maduro needed to win, at any cost.
"There was oxygen, but they didn't let me use it," said Dr. Arias, who defected from the Cuban government's medical program late last year and now lives in Chile. "We had to leave it for the election."
To maintain their hold over Venezuela, Mr. Maduro and his supporters have often used the nation's economic collapse to their advantage, dangling food before hungry voters, promising extra subsidies if he won, and demanding that people present identification cards tied to government rations when they came to the polls.
But participants in the schemes say Mr. Maduro and his supporters have deployed another tool as well: Cuba's international medical corps.
In interviews, 16 members of Cuba's medical missions to Venezuela -- a signature element of relations between the two countries -- described a system of deliberate political manipulation in which their services were wielded to secure votes for the governing Socialist Party, often through coercion.
Many tactics were used, they said, from simple reminders to vote for the government to denying treatment for opposition supporters with life-threatening ailments.
The Cuban doctors said they were ordered to go door-to-door in impoverished neighborhoods, offering medicine and warning residents that they would be cut off from medical services if they did not vote for Mr. Maduro or his candidates.
Many said their superiors directed them to issue the same threats during closed-door consultations with patients seeking treatment for chronic diseases.
One former Cuban supervisor said that she and other foreign medical workers were given counterfeit identification cards to vote in an election. Another doctor said she and others were told to give precise voting instructions to elderly patients, whose infirmities made them particularly easy to manipulate.
"These are the kinds of things you should never do in your life," said the doctor. Like several others, she spoke on the condition of anonymity because she and her relatives could face retaliation by the Cuban or Venezuelan authorities.
The accounts of manipulation and fraud underscore the many challenges to Mr. Maduro's legitimacy as president. After the start of his second term in January, the opposition-controlled legislature declared its leader, Juan GuaidÃ³, the country's rightful president, calling the election undemocratic.
More than 50 countries, including the United States, now recognize Mr. GuaidÃ³ as Venezuela's president, though Mr. Maduro still holds the reins of power.
Mr. Maduro's opponents often accuse Cuba -- which has long depended on oil from Venezuela -- of propping up his embattled government by sending agents to work with Venezuela's intelligence agencies, helping its ideological ally crush dissent.
But the use of Cuban doctors to exert political control is not widely known, the doctors say, and the practice casts a harsh light on a sweeping exchange that supposedly benefits all Venezuelans, regardless of their politics.
The Venezuelan government did not respond to questions, while the Cuban government noted that, for decades, its doctors have been celebrated for their medical missions across the globe, fighting Ebola in Africa, blindness in Latin America and cholera in Haiti, to name a few.
It rejected the doctors' assertions that they had been dragged into campaigns and pressured to manipulate or threaten patients for political ends in Venezuela, citing the "honorable task" they have accomplished.
"The historical impact of that cooperation in Venezuela has been reflected in the 1,473,117 human lives that have been saved," the government said.
But human rights experts point to the special pact between Cuba and Venezuela over the last two decades.
"The Cuban government wants to make sure the Venezuelan regime survives and is willing to do anything in their power to support Maduro," said JosÃ© Miguel Vivanco, director of the Americas program at Human Rights Watch. "It is unspeakable."
'A form of blackmail'
Dr. Carlos RamÃ­rez loved the work.
A dental surgeon, he left Cuba and came to Venezuela, proud of the cause. Many of his patients had never seen a dentist before, he said.
But he despised one part of his job: Each weekend, he and other medical workers were told to hand out medicine and enlist voters for Venezuela's Socialist Party, he said. The visits were so routine they had a name -- "casa-a-casa," or house-to-house.
"You arrived with vitamins and some pills for blood pressure" or the like, said Mr. RamÃ­rez, who defected to Ecuador after six years. "And when you started to gain their trust, you started the questions: 'Do you know where your voting place is? Are you going to vote?' "
All 16 of the Cuban medical personnel interviewed confirmed the house-to-house visits mixing medicine and politics.
They were part of Barrio Adentro, a program set up by former President Hugo ChÃ¡vez in 2003 to bring medicine to poor neighborhoods in Venezuela. Under a new Constitution passed in 1999, health care was a universal right. Shifting the nation's focus to the poor, Mr. ChÃ¡vez turned to Cuba for medical personnel.
Cuba, still reeling from the collapse of its former patron, the Soviet Union, had much to gain. Doctors are the island's most profitable export, with medical missions in more than 60 countries that provide Cuba with an estimated $8 billion in cash. Venezuela paid for its doctors in a precious resource: oil.
Mr. ChÃ¡vez was beloved by many Venezuelans. So in the early years, Mr. RamÃ­rez and other doctors said they were mainly instructed to remind voters that Mr. ChÃ¡vez had provided the medicine -- and should be thanked with their votes.
But in 2013, after battling cancer, Mr. ChÃ¡vez died. His handpicked successor, Mr. Maduro, was not nearly as popular and faced a strong challenge from the opposition.
Mr. RamÃ­rez and other doctors say they were then told to deliver a warning: If Mr. Maduro lost the election, the next government would break ties with Cuba and Venezuelans would lose their medical care.
"With Chavez it had been hard, but with Maduro, starting in 2013, it was worse," another Cuban doctor said. "It became a form of blackmail: 'You're not going to have medicine. You're not going to have free health care. You're not going to have prenatal care if you're a pregnant woman.' "
Four of the Cuban medical workers said the government established "electoral command centers" inside or next to clinics, with Socialist Party operatives dispatching doctors to pressure residents.
One added that, on the day Mr. Maduro was elected to his first term, she witnessed officials opening ballot boxes and tampering with votes, including destroying ballots that chose the opposition. Another said she and others were asked to vote with false identification.
On April 14, 2013, officials declared Mr. Maduro the winner with 50.6 percent of the vote, one of the narrowest margins in years.
"I asked myself, 'Why is a physician, someone who is meant to be on a humanitarian mission, having a part in who wins an election?"' said one of the doctors. "This is called tampering. There is no other word for it."
Fake doctors dispensing medicine
By 2015, the headwinds facing Mr. Maduro had grown. Oil prices and production were dropping. The shortages of basic goods had begun. The opposition was seeking control of the legislature, and appeared headed for victory.
"Because the opposition was favored to win, they gave us the work of buying votes," said RaÃºl Manuel, a Cuban doctor now in Brazil. "Buying votes in what sense? Going out with medicine."
Dr. Manuel said he was sent to Barinas, the state where Mr. ChÃ¡vez was born. But it had begun to turn against the Socialist Party, and resentment against Cuban doctors was building for their pact with the government.
When Dr. Manuel did his required house-to-house visits, some residents unleashed dogs or came to the door armed, he and other doctors said.
On Election Day, Dr. Manuel said he was sent to an opposition stronghold. When early returns showed the opposition ahead, a gun battle broke out. Dr. Manuel said he found himself trapped on a cul-de-sac as bullets ricocheted around him.
He called his clinic for help, he said, but it was busy sending out doctors to get voters to the polls.
"They said they had no cars to rescue us," he said.
After the shootout, Dr. Manuel said he returned to the clinic, shaken, only to learn that government officials from other departments -- including the sports and culture agencies -- were going out, too, posing as doctors.
"We, the doctors, were asked to give our extra robes to people," he said.
The fake doctors were even giving out medicines, without knowing what they were or how to use them, he added.
"They were putting the lives of so many people at risk, the lives of children, all to win votes," Dr. Manuel said.
Another Cuban doctor in Barinas offered the same account: that government employees, dressed as physicians, were sent out with medicine to get votes.
When the final tally came in, Mr. Maduro's party had been trounced nationally, losing its majority in the legislature for the first time since 1999.
'How they controlled people'
By the time Dr. Arias arrived in late 2016, Venezuela was suffering a grinding collapse.
The economic implosion had led to chronic shortages of food. Inflation had hit so hard that people paid with stacks of bills, counted at cash registers with electric bill counters. Crimes and killings soared.
And then there were the hospitals. Vital medicines couldn't be imported because the government had little cash. Water cuts meant surgeons used bottled water to clean their hands, without soap, which was also in short supply.
Doling out the little medicine that remained, the doctors now focused their vote-getting efforts on patients with chronic illnesses, who needed repeated attention, Dr. Arias said.
"The theme was chronic illnesses, the ones where you would die if patients didn't get medicine, and that's how they controlled people," Dr. Arias recalled.
Mr. Maduro was fighting for control himself. Protests swept the capital for months, setting off a government crackdown in which more than 100 people died in street battles.
After receiving death threats from patients, Dr. Arias said he was sent to a fishing town, La Vela del Coro, where food shortages led doctors and nurses to steal medicine and trade it for groceries.
"I saw it with my own eyes," he said, recounting how a Cuban nurse traded antibiotics for "a kilo of potatoes, a kilo of yams."
Residents of La Vela confirmed that both Cuban and Venezuelan doctors regularly bartered medicine for goods on the black market.
In mid-2017, Mr. Maduro made a bid to consolidate power: a referendum for a second legislature to replace the opposition-controlled National Assembly.
Calling the vote illegal, the opposition refused to participate, so the slate of candidates was composed entirely of figures loyal to the president.
The new legislature quickly sidelined the National Assembly, embarking on an aggressive agenda to silence Mr. Maduro's critics.
The government pushed a contentious identification system called the "homeland card," used by the Socialist Party for both food subsidies and voting. Mr. Maduro urged citizens to get the card to receive groceries, and party officials opened kiosks outside polling places to review the cards after people cast their ballots.
Dr. Arias said that doctors' house-to-house visits started registering people for the cards. But the cards terrified many Venezuelans, who feared the government would see how they voted and restrict their food in retaliation.
Before an election for governors that year, Mr. Arias recalled an epileptic patient in the hospital who needed treatment but had refused the homeland card.
"'I don't want anything to do with this homeland! I don't want anything to do with Maduro!"' he recalled her shouting. She was sent away without medication, he said, "because she was from the opposition."
As the returns came in, Mr. Maduro's party claimed a lopsided victory, taking 17 of the 23 governorships, despite polls that had projected losses.
"Today, the homeland has gotten stronger," Mr. Maduro said that night.
'I argued with my colleagues'
In 2018, it was Mr. Maduro's turn to face voters.
Measures were taken to ensure his victory. One challenger, Leopoldo LÃ³pez, was dragged between house arrest and a military prison. Another, Henrique Capriles, was banned from running, along with most opposition parties.
As shortages worsened, Mr. Maduro promised hefty subsidies to those using the homeland card, saying openly: "I give, you give."
But his government withheld other essentials.
Dr. Arias said medical supplies, always scarce in La Vela, soon disappeared, hoarded until the May election. He said his superiors wanted to flood hospitals with supplies right before the vote, giving the impression that Mr. Maduro had fixed the country's shortages.
"When the elections came, everything appeared: medicine, gas, dressings for bandages, injection serums," he said. Residents in La Vela who had gone to the clinic confirmed it was suddenly supplied before the election.
The case of the oxygen tanks still weighs heavily on Dr. Arias.
"I argued with my colleagues over and over," he said. "Yes, of course there was oxygen, but they didn't let me use it."
Ãngel Villegas, La Vela's opposition mayor, said he was denied medication, too, told that it was in short supply.
"There are a large number of services where you feel that, yes, they took into consideration the fact that you were in the opposition," he said.
As Election Day neared, the doctors continued to fan out in support of Mr. Maduro.
"They come to your house, they ask you a series of questions, and you start to think, if I answer 'no,' they can cut me from health care," said one patient, who declined to be named, fearing government reprisals. "It just leaves you overwhelmed."
On May 20, Mr. Maduro was declared the winner, landing him a second term. For Dr. Arias, it was too much.
He made his way to Chile, taking shelter in a church, cleaning floors in a hospital and seeking asylum, unable to find work as a doctor.
"If I can't be a doctor, I at least want to be a person," he said.
It's unclear how many other doctors have abandoned Cuba's medical missions around the world -- informal estimates are in the thousands -- but the consequences are stark. Dr. Arias and the others are considered deserters by the Cuban government and cannot return to their families.
Dr. RamÃ­rez, the dental surgeon, is one of the few doctors interviewed who has returned to medicine, with a small practice in Ecuador.
"You don't finally realize what is right, until you open your eyes," he said.

Full text: The other day I found myself, as I often do, at a conference discussing lagging wages and soaring inequality. There was a lot of interesting discussion. But one thing that struck me was how many of the participants just assumed that robots are a big part of the problem -- that machines are taking away the good jobs, or even jobs in general. For the most part this wasn't even presented as a hypothesis, just as part of what everyone knows.
And this assumption has real implications for policy discussion. For example, a lot of the agitation for a universal basic income comes from the belief that jobs will become ever scarcer as the robot apocalypse overtakes the economy.
So it seems like a good idea to point out that in this case what everyone knows isn't true. Predictions are hard, especially about the future, and maybe the robots really will come for all our jobs one of these days. But automation just isn't a big part of the story of what happened to American workers over the past 40 years.
We do have a big problem -- but it has very little to do with technology, and a lot to do with politics and power.
Let's back up for a minute, and ask: What is a robot, anyway? Clearly, it doesn't have to be something that looks like C-3PO, or rolls around saying "Exterminate! Exterminate!" From an economic point of view, a robot is anything that uses technology to do work formerly done by human beings.
And robots in that sense have been transforming our economy literally for centuries. David Ricardo, one of the founding fathers of economics, wrote about the disruptive effects of machinery in 1821!
[Paul Krugman did explanatory journalism before it was cool, moving from a career as a world-class economist to writing hard-hitting opinion columns. For an even deeper look at what's on his mind, sign up for his weekly newsletter.]
These days, when people talk about the robot apocalypse, they don't usually think of things like strip mining and mountaintop removal. Yet these technologies utterly transformed coal mining: Coal production almost doubled between 1950 and 2000 (it only began falling a few years ago), yet the number of coal miners fell from 470,000 to fewer than 80,000.
Or consider freight containerization. Longshoremen used to be a big part of the scene in major port cities. But while global trade has soared since the 1970s, the share of U.S. workers engaged in "marine cargo handling" has fallen by two-thirds.
Technological disruption, then, isn't a new phenomenon. Still, is it accelerating? Not according to the data. If robots really were replacing workers en masse, we'd expect to see the amount of stuff produced by each remaining worker -- labor productivity -- soaring. In fact, productivity grew a lot faster from the mid-1990s to the mid-2000s than it has since.
So technological change is an old story. What's new is the failure of workers to share in the fruits of that technological change.
I'm not saying that coping with change was ever easy. The decline of coal employment had devastating effects on many families, and much of what used to be coal country has never recovered. The loss of manual jobs in port cities surely contributed to the urban social crisis of the '70s and '80s.
But while there have always been some victims of technological progress, until the 1970s rising productivity translated into rising wages for a great majority of workers. Then the connection was broken. And it wasn't the robots that did it.
What did? There is a growing though incomplete consensus among economists that a key factor in wage stagnation has been workers' declining bargaining power -- a decline whose roots are ultimately political.
Most obviously, the federal minimum wage, adjusted for inflation, has fallen by a third over the past half century, even as worker productivity has risen 150 percent. That divergence was politics, pure and simple.
The decline of unions, which covered a quarter of private-sector workers in 1973 but only 6 percent now, may not be as obviously political. But other countries haven't seen the same kind of decline. Canada is as unionized now as the U.S. was in 1973; in the Nordic nations unions cover two-thirds of the work force. What made America exceptional was a political environment deeply hostile to labor organizing and friendly toward union-busting employers.
And the decline of unions has made a huge difference. Consider the case of trucking, which used to be a good job but now pays a third less than it did in the 1970s, with terrible working conditions. What made the difference? De-unionization was a big part of the story.
And these easily quantifiable factors are just indicators of a sustained, across-the-board anti-worker bias in our politics.
Which brings me back to the question of why we're talking so much about robots. The answer, I'd argue, is that it's a diversionary tactic -- a way to avoid facing up to the way our system is rigged against workers, similar to the way talk of a "skills gap" was a way to divert attention from bad policies that kept unemployment high.
And progressives, above all, shouldn't fall for this facile fatalism. American workers can and should be getting a much better deal than they are. And to the extent that they aren't, the fault lies not in our robots, but in our political leaders.

Health Care and Tech Keep Rally Going

Full text: Health care and technology companies powered stocks broadly higher on Wall Street on Wednesday, giving the market its third straight gain.
Boeing briefly dipped, but finished slightly higher, after the United States said it was joining other countries in grounding the company's 737 Max 8 airplane following a fatal crash of an Ethiopian airliner over the weekend.
The S&P 500 has now clawed back all its losses from last week, when the index posted its worst week since December.
The market has rebounded this week even though the trade dispute between the United States and China has yet to be resolved and the outlook for earnings growth has dimmed this year.
A batch of economic reports helped drive the latest rally, supporting an upbeat view of the economy. Oil prices rose after new government data showed lower-than expected stockpiles.
"I'm still scratching my head to find out what kind of an upside catalyst we've actually gotten, other than just maybe an aggregate of relatively positive economic reports that individually aren't enough to move the market," said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab.
The S&P 500 gained 19.40 points, or 0.7 percent, to 2,810.92. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 148.23 points, or 0.6 percent, to 25,702.89.
The Nasdaq composite climbed 52.37 points, or 0.7 percent, to 7,643.41.
The three-day rally has helped the market reclaim the momentum it had in January and February, when it posted the best two-month start to a year since 1991. The S&P 500, Nasdaq and Dow are showing double-digit gains for the year so far.
Still, investors are still waiting for more details on any potential trade deal between the United States and China.
Traders drew encouragement from several economic reports Wednesday.
Wholesale prices in the United States barely increased last month after falling for three straight months, a sign there is little inflation pressure in the economy. A report on orders to American factories showed that business investment rose 0.8 percent after two months of declines, marking the biggest gain since a 1.5 percent July bump.
A burst of late-afternoon buying reversed a slide in Boeing shares. The stock briefly headed lower after the United States moved to temporarily ground all the aircraft manufacturer's 737 Max 8 and Max 9 airplanes in the wake of Sunday's deadly crash of an Ethiopian Airlines 737 Max 8, which killed 157 people. A similar Lion Air plane crashed in Indonesia in October, killing 189 people.
Boeing shares finished with a 0.5 percent gain. The stock slumped more than 11 percent the first two days of this week. Despite the recent slide, the stock is still up 16.9 percent for the year.
Health care sector stocks notched the biggest gain Tuesday.
Rite Aid jumped 6.1 percent after the drugstore chain announced a purge of its top management and plans to cut 400 jobs.
Chipmaker Nvidia added 3.8 percent, leading technology sector stocks higher. Synchrony Financial gained 2.2 percent amid a broad financial sector rally.
Investors bid up shares in Canadian marijuana company Aurora Cannabis after it tapped hedge fund manager Nelson Peltz as an adviser. Mr. Peltz is the chief executive and a founding partner of Trian Fund Management. Aurora said he will help the company explore potential partnerships and advise its global expansion plans. The stock jumped 13 percent.
Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.63 percent from 2.60 percent late Tuesday.
The dollar fell to 111.05 Japanese yen from 111.29 yen on Tuesday. The euro rose to $1.1329 from $1.1297.
The price of United States crude oil climbed 2.4 percent to settle at $58.26 a barrel.
The price of gold rose 0.9 percent to $1,309.30 an ounce.

Full text: Technology and health care companies led U.S. stock indexes mostly higher Tuesday, building on the market's solid gains from a day earlier.
Boeing weighed down the Dow Jones Industrial Average for a second day as shares in the aircraft maker fell amid safety concerns following another deadly crash involving its most popular plane. The company led a slide in industrial sector stocks.
A report showing that U.S. consumer prices rose modestly last month -- the latest evidence that inflation remains in check -- also helped lift stocks.
The latest gains extend a rebound in stocks this week after the market ended last week with its worst week since December.
"It just goes to show that investors are taking advantage of the pullback we had last week," said Lindsey Bell, investment strategist at CFRA. "What's notable in the last couple of days is the move you're seeing in the Nasdaq. You're starting to see that return to growth in the market right now."
The benchmark S&P 500 index gained 8.22 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,791.52. The Dow fell 96.22 points, or 0.4 percent, to 25,554.66.
The Nasdaq composite, which is heavily weighted with technology stocks, climbed 32.97 points, or 0.4 percent, to 7,591.03. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies picked up 0.96 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,549.83.
Major European stock indexes finished mostly higher before Britain's Parliament voted to reject a deal for the U.K. to exit from the European Union. The move plunges the Brexit process into chaos just 17 days before Britain is due to leave the bloc.
Traders appeared to mostly shrug off the developments in Britain, though U.S. indexes lost some of their gains toward the end of the day as the Brexit vote was being held.
The two-day rally has helped the market reclaim the momentum it had in January and February, when it posted the best two-month start to a year since 1991. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq are showing double-digits gains for the year so far, and the Dow is up by more than 9 percent.
Investors are still waiting for more details on any potential trade deal between the U.S. and China. Costly tariffs have hurt both nations and investors hope a deal can be struck to at least take some pressure off the global economy, which has shown signs of cooling off.
"We're just in this weird period where earnings just ended, we're waiting to see what happens with Brexit, waiting for a resolution from China and the trade situation there," Bell said. "We're in wait-and-see mode."
Technology and health care stocks did the most to push the market higher Tuesday. Apple and UnitedHealth each rose 1.1 percent.
Boeing shares slid 6.1 percent, the stock's second day of steep losses, as more countries grounded the aircraft manufacturer's 737 Max 8 following the crash of the Ethiopian Airlines 737 Max 8 on Sunday, which killed 157 people. A similar Lion Air plane crashed in Indonesia in October, killing 189 people.
Britain joined a growing number of countries to ground the plane. Australia and Singapore suspended all flights into or out of their countries. Airlines in China and Indonesia, Aeromexico, Brazil's Gol Airlines, India's Jet Airways and others have done the same.
The Labor Department's latest snapshot of consumer prices also put investors in a buying mood. The consumer price index rose a modest 1.5 percent last month from a year ago. The small increase is the latest evidence that inflation remains muted, which gives the Federal Reserve more flexibility in holding off on further interest rate increases, said Eric Wiegand, senior portfolio manager for Private Wealth Management at U.S. Bank.
"The markets are reflecting a more favorable interpretation of the shift in central bank policies," he said. "They're creating more of a favorable backdrop."
Traders bid up shares in Stitch Fix after the personal styling service blew past analyst's expectations for the fourth-quarter. The stock vaulted 25.2 percent.
Dick's Sporting Goods' plunged 11 percent after the company reported a slide in sales during the fourth quarter and a weak forecast. A key sales figure fell 2.2 percent in the period, worse than what analysts were expecting.
Marijuana stocks rose after New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy and legislative leaders said they've agreed on legislation to legalize recreational marijuana for adults. The agreement comes after more than a year of negotiations.
Tilray gained 3.1 percent, while Canopy Growth added 1.4 percent.
Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.61 percent from 2.64 percent late Monday.
The dollar strengthened to 111.29 Japanese yen from 111.21 yen on Monday. The euro rose to $1.1297 from $1.1240.
The price of U.S. crude oil rose 8 cents to $56.87 a barrel, while Brent crude rose 9 cents to $66.67 a barrel. Wholesale gasoline fell 1 cent to $1.82 a gallon, heating oil fell less than 1 cent to $1.99 a gallon and natural gas rose 1 cent to $2.78 per 1,000 cubic feet.
The price of gold rose 7 cents to $1,291.10 an ounce, silver rose 14 cents to $15.41 an ounce and copper rose 3 cents to $2.93 a pound.

Full text: CAIRO -- President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi likes to flaunt his plans for modernizing Egypt, like the flashy new administrative capital rising from the desert outside Cairo. But most Egyptians view his rule as a time of painful belt-tightening, with soaring inflation, a currency crash and cuts to subsidies that have made fuel, electricity and water more expensive.
Now there is a ray of hope emerging a hundred miles offshore.
It comes in the form of a windfall natural gas discovery with the potential to lift Egypt's limping economy, build a new commercial alliance with Israel and, maybe, even revive the country's diminished regional clout.
Egypt's gas push is part of a tectonic shift in energy and geopolitics. Natural gas, long a poor cousin to oil, is gaining importance and becoming a tool for countries to leverage power and prestige. Advances in the shipping of liquefied gas have made it a global fuel and strengthened the hand of countries that until recently were not major energy exporters, including the United States and now Egypt.
The flood of new gas has been bad news for traditional exporters, particularly Russia, which has had to slash gas prices to maintain sales to Europe. Many European countries have long sought to reduce their dependence on Russia and are eager to establish new suppliers even if that means doing business with autocratic states like Egypt and Qatar, a longstanding gas supplier embroiled in a bitter diplomatic feud with its Persian Gulf neighbors.
In recent years the eastern Mediterranean has become one of the world's hottest offshore drilling zones, with a string of major gas discoveries in the territorial waters of Israel, Lebanon and Cyprus. Egypt struck the jackpot in 2015 with the discovery of a giant reservoir known as Zohr that has developed into one of the largest single gas fields in the Middle East.
"We have scored a goal," Mr. Sisi said in a televised speech last year. "I've been dreaming about it for four years, that we become a regional hub for energy."
Egypt now produces a record 6.3 billion cubic feet of gas a day -- up by more than 30 percent since 2016 -- making it one of the biggest producers in North Africa and the Middle East. In January, for the first time in several years, Egypt exported more gas than it imported. Exports are still a trickle, and Egyptian citizens have yet to see much benefit, but the government has hopes for an export-fueled boom.
Oil companies plan to expand gas production by more than 40 percent in Egypt this year and are optimistic about the eastern Mediterranean more broadly.
Last week Exxon Mobil announced yet another gas discovery in the waters of Cyprus that is similar in size to two other large fields nearby. The United States Geological Survey has projected that enough gas will eventually be found in the eastern Mediterranean to meet regional and European power demand for decades.
"Egypt is one of the best places, along with Cyprus and Israel, to drill not only because of the discoveries but because it is close to Europe and Europe is increasing its gas use," said Claudio Descalzi, chief executive of Eni, the Italian energy giant that is developing the Zohr field. "Egypt has all the ingredients to make it successful."
Energy giants have been flocking to Egypt in part because the government in 2015 raised the price it would pay companies for their gas by more than a third.
BP invested more money in Egypt over the last two years than any other nation, and is adding $1.8 billion this year. All told, foreign oil companies are putting an estimated $10 billion into the country this year.
Egypt's new gas fortune is fortified by the fact that it has the only two large-scale gas export terminals in the eastern Mediterranean, which were built during a prior era of gas riches. The terminals, which cool gas into liquids for export by tankers, have been largely mothballed since 2014 when domestic consumption overwhelmed production.
Royal Dutch Shell and Eni, which have ownership interests in the terminals, plan to have them fully operational this year. They also hope to use them to re-export gas produced by neighboring countries that do not have such terminals.
"We see a new dawn in Egypt," said Michael Stoppard, chief strategist for global gas markets at IHS Markit, an energy consulting firm. "We don't see this as a flash in the pan."
The gas boom could help Egypt geopolitically, too, allowing Mr. Sisi to strengthen economic ties with Israel and Jordan while becoming an indispensable partner to Europe.
A meeting in Cairo in January signaled the extent of his ambitions.
Representatives from six Mediterranean countries and the Palestinian Authority agreed to create a regional gas organization to coordinate regulations on pipelines and commerce. The meeting included Israel's energy minister, Yuval Steinitz, who was on the first official visit by an Israeli minister to Egypt since the 2011 Arab Spring.
Egypt and Israel have been quietly cooperating for years in the fight against Islamic State militants in Sinai. Now they have bolstered their partnership in energy. Last year the Israeli oil company Delek Drilling and Noble Energy of Houston signed a deal to pipe $15 billion of Israel's offshore gas to the Egyptian export terminals. There are plans to reopen a pipeline between Israel and Egypt through Sinai that shut down in 2012.
"The fact that Israeli natural gas will be exported to Europe via Egypt facilities, the fact that we are speaking to each other," Mr. Steinitz said in an interview, "make this an access for peace."
Also in January, Egypt struck a deal to provide half of Jordan's gas needs by pipeline, replacing imports of more expensive liquefied gas. The Sisi government is also working to resume exports to Lebanon by another pipeline that has been inactive for years.
But if gas can bring countries together, it can also stoke tensions. For example, Turkey and Cyprus have been squabbling for years about drilling in disputed waters. The pipeline through Sinai was attacked by militants in the 2000s and early 2010s. And the new Egyptian-Israeli energy relationship could be diminished if Israel builds a proposed undersea pipeline to Europe.
The gas windfall has the potential to stabilize Egypt's precarious, debt-laden finances and help clean up its polluted air. The government is pushing drivers to convert vehicles from diesel and gasoline to cheaper, cleaner natural gas. So far, 250,000 of the country's 10 million vehicles have made the switch.
But there's little sign of the gas windfall on the streets of Cairo, where the government has failed to dent high unemployment or halt a slide in public services.
A few weeks ago, Mohamed Ramadan took his taxi to a government-financed garage to have it converted from gasoline to compressed natural gas. The government is offering financial incentives and building filling stations.
Mr. Ramadan estimated the conversion would save him 50 percent on fuel expenses, which would help him make his car installments and pay school fees for his three children. But he worried that inflation would wipe out most of what he saved.
"It really doesn't make much of a difference, because everything else is getting more expensive," he said.
Like many developing countries, Egypt has a mixed record of sharing the benefits of mineral wealth. In the 2000s, Egypt's ruler at the time, Hosni Mubarak, frittered away export earnings from an earlier gas boom on energy subsidies while doling out lucrative contracts to cronies.
By 2009, the boom was over, and oil companies shipped out their drilling rigs. In 2012 a court sentenced Hussein Salem, a business tycoon and Mubarak confidant, to 15 years in prison for his part in a scheme involving a manipulation of gas sales to Israel that was estimated to have cost Egypt several billion dollars. (Mr. Salem, who was living in Europe, avoided prison.)
Egypt's economic and demographic problems have worsened since then. Youth unemployment is around 34 percent, and the population is growing by a million people every six months and is expected to surpass 100 million later this year.
Even energy executives warn that Egypt could squander its gas wealth if the government doesn't cut electricity and gas subsidies to control rising domestic energy consumption.
Gas discoveries are a "sizable gift," said Ahmed Heikal, chairman of Qalaa Holdings, a leading energy investment company. "But if you receive a gift from God you have to use it wisely."

Full text: WASHINGTON -- President Trump's $4.75 trillion budget proposal unveiled on Monday brims with confidence that the United States economy will continue to expand rapidly, despite recent data suggesting growth is slowing.
Mr. Trump told reporters last week that the economy is "very, very strong." His budget proposal forecasts 3.2 percent growth in 2019, which would be a slight increase from last year and the strongest rate since 2005. It estimates similarly strong growth for the next decade, enough to eventually reverse the expansion of the federal budget deficit under Mr. Trump's watch.
But there are signs, in the indicators Mr. Trump watches closely, that his economic policies are beginning to work against his economic goals.
Waning stimulus from Mr. Trump's 2017 tax cut and economic damage from his global trade war are undermining the president's oft-stated objective of increasing growth and reducing America's trade and budget deficits.
The Federal Reserve and Congressional Budget Office both expect 2.3 percent growth for the year. A group of economists surveyed monthly by The Wall Street Journal now predicts 2.2 percent growth for the year.
Mr. Trump's tariffs on steel, aluminum and $250 billion worth of Chinese imports are beginning to raise consumer prices, and could push inflation much higher if they are left in place or expanded. That could force the Fed to resume its path of raising interest rates, which Mr. Trump has repeatedly criticized as impeding the economy.
The administration's own budget projections show $1 trillion deficits for the next four years, and no balanced budget for 15 years, even with assumptions of strong economic growth. Mr. Trump's $1.5 trillion tax cuts have driven much of the deficit increase -- federal tax collections from businesses and individuals fell 9 percent in January compared with the year before -- along with spending increases he signed when Republicans controlled both chambers of Congress.
White House officials insist the tax cuts will eventually pay for themselves through revenue growth. Most economists disagree. And most budget hawks expect Mr. Trump to rack up larger deficits than his budget predicts.
Another key metric Mr. Trump watches -- the trade deficit -- is also widening. The gap between the goods America buys from its trading partners and the goods it sells grew to a record high in 2018, despite Mr. Trump's focus on narrowing that deficit.
Few of these developments have surprised economic forecasters, who have long warned that Mr. Trump's economic policy initiatives would undermine his overarching goals.
Mr. Trump's tariffs on steel, aluminum and Chinese imports have hurt American exports, as trading partners imposed retaliatory tariffs and Chinese officials stopped buying key American products like soybeans. Perhaps more consequentially, forecasters say, although the president's signature tax cuts fueled economic growth last year, they also helped widen the trade and budget deficits.
"The trade deficit and budget deficit are inherently related," said Diane Swonk, the chief economist at Grant Thornton. "When you blow a hole in your budget deficit, you need to rely more on the rest of the world for your borrowing."
Many economists say fading stimulus from the corporate and individual tax cuts is driving their growth projections below 3 percent for this year. But that, too, is not a surprise.
"The slowdown in growth is in line with our expectations," said Alexander Arnon, a senior analyst at the Penn Wharton Budget Model at the University of Pennsylvania, which projects 2.2 percent growth this year.
About half of the drop-off from 2018, Mr. Arnon said, was attributable to the end of the "immediate boost" to the economy from the tax cut package Mr. Trump signed in late 2017.
Increased federal borrowing to fund the tax cuts "may account for much or all of the rise in the trade deficit," Mr. Arnon said. Foreigners purchased up to $100 billion in additional United States debt last year, using dollars they got from selling more products to America.
Mr. Trump has said little recently about the trade or budget deficits. Like most of his predecessors, he has accentuated positive statistics to promote his stewardship of the economy, including a 3.8 percent unemployment rate and, in data released on Friday by the Labor Department, the fastest wage growth in a decade.
Strong growth has buoyed the president's approval ratings on economic issues. Gallup reported last week that 56 percent of Americans approve of his handling of the economy and 54 percent approve of his handling of unemployment, well above the 43 percent who approve of his performance overall.
Slower growth could threaten those ratings.
Goldman Sachs reduced its forecast for first-quarter growth on Monday to just 0.5 percent, after new data showed weakening consumption over the last several months. If that forecast proves correct, the economy would need to average 4.1 percent growth for the next three quarters to reach Mr. Trump's 3.2 percent goal for the year.
Mr. Trump and his advisers are confident that growth will speed up this year, because they see tax cuts continuing to increase investment in the economy and entice more Americans, particularly those older than 50, back into the work force. The chairman of Mr. Trump's Council of Economic Advisers, Kevin Hassett, said growth could be higher than 3.2 percent this year, if Mr. Trump completes a trade deal with China that bolsters American exports.
Past White House budgets have often overshot in their predictions for the next year's growth. Mr. Hassett said he was confident that was not the case this year, because his team's forecasts did not prove overly optimistic in either 2017 or 2018. He said the slowing growth of recent months most likely reflected chronic seasonal factors and temporary damage from the prolonged government shutdown at the start of the year, and would be reversed in the months to come.
"If the data come in different from our projections, we have to explain why and consider a revision to our forecast," Mr. Hassett said. "This year, we don't see any reason to do that."
Mr. Trump and some of his advisers view the Fed as the biggest obstacle to meeting growth targets this year. The president has, publicly and privately, criticized the Fed for interest rate increases that he warns could chill growth.
The Fed paused its upward march in rates this year, and Chairman Jerome H. Powell has promised a "patient" approach to future increases. Mr. Powell, appearing Sunday on "60 Minutes" on CBS, said that "patient means that we don't feel any hurry to change our interest rate policy."
Some of Mr. Trump's confidants want the Fed to go further to increase growth: Stephen Moore, a campaign economic adviser to Mr. Trump, is pushing for the Fed to cut interest rates immediately to counteract a decline in commodity prices that followed rate increases at the end of 2018.
"The Fed is sucking the oxygen out of the economy and has created an economically debilitating deflation," Mr. Moore said, citing three consecutive months of declines in the Consumer Price Index -- which remains up by 1.5 percent from a year ago -- and a 10 percent drop in commodity prices since November. He called for the Fed to reverse its September and December rate increases, which would mean cutting interest rates by half a percentage point.
"The one guy who gets this is Trump," Mr. Moore said. "He told me in a meeting last month that the Fed is preventing us from staying on a 3 to 4 percent growth path."
Mr. Powell has shown no indication that the Fed is looking to cut rates.
"We've seen a bit of a slowing" in growth, Mr. Powell said, "but still to healthy levels in the U.S. economy this year. So the U.S. economy does seem to be favorable. The outlook for the U.S. economy is favorable."

Full text: Turkey has entered a recession, recording two consecutive quarters of falling economic growth, according to government figures released Monday, casting a blow for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan ahead of critical local elections at the end of the month.
Mr. Erdogan has led Turkey through 18 years of continuous growth -- making it a leading emerging market -- but much of the growth of the last few years has come through unrestrained borrowing. The lira also plunged in value in mid-2018, amid global investor concerns and a sharp fall in consumer demand.
The Turkish Statistical Institute announced that Turkey's gross domestic product shrank by 2.4 percent in the fourth quarter of last year from the previous quarter, after seasonal adjustments. That fall followed a decline of 1.6 percent in the third quarter. A recession occurs, by some definitions, after two quarters of contraction.
A global economic slowdown has reduced demand for Turkish exports and raised the cost of credit for its businesses. Growth in the European Union, Turkey's most important market, has slowed to a crawl while Italy is in recession and Germany close to one.
Economists had been warning of a recession for months as foreign investment in Turkey dried up over growing concerns about the rule of law as well as about its economic policies. Turkey's growth was fueled in part by the availability of cheap foreign credit, but that credit flow has slowed, as in other emerging markets, after the Federal Reserve in the United States raised interest rates.
The government has been subsidizing big infrastructure projects like bridges, subways and Istanbul's new airport, planned as the world's busiest. Many businesses have borrowed in foreign currencies, which means their debt burdens rose as the lira fell.
By the end of the year, Turkish private-sector companies owed more than $250 billion in foreign debt, or nearly one-third the size of the country's economy.
For all of 2018, Turkey still achieved growth of 2.8 percent, but the economy took a precipitous turn midyear as the lira weakened. Investment agencies have revised Turkey's credit ratings, and Turkey's banks have almost stopped lending.
Borrowing has become more expensive for Turkey and other emerging markets because investors have become wary of the risk, while rising interest rates and buoyant stocks have lured money back to the United States. Turkey has also been particularly hard hit by President Trump's trade war. United States tariffs on Turkish steel imports are 50 percent, double the duties on steel from other countries.
Bankruptcies, meanwhile, rose in the last months of 2018, and inflation has remained over 20 percent for months.
Mr. Erdogan has ruled out turning to the International Monetary Fund for funds, emphasizing that he had taken Turkey out of an earlier program with the fund and paid off its debts. He has instead courted investment from Arab gulf countries and reduced some public spending.
Since a failed coup d'Ã©tat two years ago that attempted to topple him, Mr. Erdogan has assumed more power over government agencies, including economic policy. He was re-elected in June and has brought all branches of government under the presidency.
He appointed his son-in-law, Berat Albyrak, as minister of finance and Treasury and through him has kept close control of the Central Bank. When Mr. Erdogan commented just before the election that he intended to be more involved with the bank, the lira sank to record lows.
The Central Bank halted the rout by lifting rates, but its integrity was in question. The Turkish currency lost 28 percent of its value in 2018.
The currency's decline, as well as other factors, has hit Turks in their pocketbooks. Mr. Erdogan, who is personally leading his Justice and Development Party's campaign for local elections, has opened subsidized markets stalls around the country to sell cheap vegetables to ease discontent.

The Experts Keep Getting the Economy Wrong

Full text: President Trump likes to brag about the supposedly booming economy. So do other Republican politicians. Some journalists have gotten into the habit too, exaggerating the strength of the economic expansion, because it makes for a good story.
Here's the truth: There is no boom. The economy has been mired in an extended funk since the financial crisis ended in 2010. G.D.P. growth still has not reached 3 percent in any year, and 3 percent isn't a very high bar.
Last week, while attending an economics conference in Washington, I discovered one particularly clear sign of the economy's struggles -- namely, that it keeps performing worse than the experts have predicted. I put together this chart to show the trend:
Again and again, Federal Reserve officials have overestimated how quickly the economy would grow. They keep having to revise their forecasts downward, only to discover that they didn't go far enough down. Economists on Wall Street and other parts of the private sector have made the same mistake.
Over time, the differences between the experts' predictions and the economy's performance have added up. The American economy would be about 6 percent larger today -- producing $1.3 trillion more in goods and services this year -- if the forecasts had come true. And for most families, real-life experience has been more disappointing than the G.D.P. numbers, because much of the bounty of the economy's growth has flowed to the affluent.
So what is ailing the American economy?
Several years ago, Lawrence Summers -- the economist and former Treasury secretary -- began using the phrase "secular stagnation" to describe the problem. The term was originally coined during the Great Depression, and it describes an economy that can't quite get healthy.
When Summers first made his case in 2013, some other economists criticized it as too pessimistic. But the repeated growth shortfalls of recent years suggest he was onto something. At last week's conference, hosted by the Brookings Institution, Olivier Blanchard -- the former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund -- said he was now more persuaded by the secular-stagnation story than he first had been. It is, Blanchard said, "more likely than not."
There are two main culprits. The first is a savings glut. Americans are saving more and spending less partly because the rich now take home so much of the economy's income -- and the rich don't spend as large a share of their income as the poor and middle class. The aging of society plays a role too, because people are saving for retirement.
[Sign up for David Leonhardt's daily newsletter with commentary on the news and reading suggestions from around the web.]
The second big cause is an investment slump. Despite all the savings available to be invested, companies are holding back. Some have grown so large and monopoly-like that they don't need to invest in new projects to make profits. Think about your internet provider: It may have terrible customer service, but you don't have a lot of alternatives. The company doesn't need to invest in new technology or employees to keep you as a customer.
Beside a lack of competition, the investment slump stems from what Summers calls the de-massification of the economy. Developers aren't building as many malls and stores, because goods now go straight from warehouses to homes. Offices don't need as much storage space. Cellphones have replaced not just desktop computers but also cameras, stereos, books and more. Many young people have decided they're happy living in small apartments, without cars.
For all of these economic problems, there are promising solutions. But the United States is not giving those solutions a try.
The 2017 Trump tax law is a useful case study. It is a dreadful piece of economic policy -- essentially a giant effort to aggravate income inequality. Tax cuts that benefit the wealthy most are huge and permanent. Tax cuts focused on everyone else are smaller and temporary.
But the law still pumped money into the economy last year, thanks largely to those temporary tax cuts for the middle class and poor. And guess what? G.D.P. growth finally met some forecasters' expectations, as you can see from the first chart above. The economy expanded 2.9 percent in 2018. Unfortunately, the boost seems to have been temporary. In the first quarter of this year, growth has slowed markedly, probably to about 0.5 percent. It will most likely grow faster over the rest of 2019, but not 3 percent. Once again, economists have started downgrading their expectations.
A better policy response would start with a tax cut focused on the majority of Americans, not the wealthy. And there are many other ways to take on secular stagnation. When I spoke to Summers last week, he rattled off a list:
Infrastructure projects, to jump-start investment. The retirement of coal-fired power plants, which would also lead to new investment. Stronger safety-net programs, including Social Security, to reduce the savings glut. More aggressive antitrust policies, to combat monopolies. And a Federal Reserve that, at long last, stopped making the same mistake -- of overestimating both growth and inflation.
After a decade of negative economic surprises, maybe we shouldn't be surprised anymore. Maybe we should try some new solutions.

Adopt Germany's Health System?

Full text: To the Editor:
Re "A Better Path to Universal Health Care," by Jamie Daw (Op-Ed, Feb. 21):
Dr. Daw holds up the German-style system of nonprofit private health insurers as a better model for the United States than a single-payer system. While I can understand why the professor believes that a German-style system "builds more naturally on the American health insurance system," it's hard to believe that it would meet significantly less resistance from the insurance industry than a single-payer system.
In fact, Dr. Daw actually explains why this is the case: "In an American version of this system, private insurers would have to be heavily regulated to ensure that coverage was affordable and to prevent the sort of rapid increases in premiums, deductibles and cost-sharing that have occurred over the past decade."
Does anyone really expect that private for-profit insurance companies will willingly convert to nonprofit status and submit to tough regulations?
Bruce Shenitz
New York
To the Editor:
As an American who has lived in Germany for over 40 years and who is alive but not impoverished today because of the quality of the German health care system, I can only echo Jamie Daw. Democratic candidates would do well to examine the multipayer systems of Germany, Austria and the Low Countries and not concentrate on the less efficient single-payer systems of Canada or Britain simply because they are described in English.
There is a place for private insurance plans in a well-organized system. Indeed, as the German system demonstrates, those of us who earn enough to be better off with private plans can actually subsidize the care offered to the publicly insured, thus raising the quality for all patients.
Steven J. Sherman
Munich
To the Editor:
Jamie Daw would do well to confer with Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut. He proposes opening up Medicare as just one more insurer, albeit a nonprofit one, and letting market forces play out as they will. That is, of course, a great oversimplification of the senator's thinking, but the underlying logic is beautifully simple.
Dave Gliserman
Oxford, Conn.
To the Editor:
In her plea to Americans to adopt German rather than Canadian-style health insurance, Jamie Daw observes that we Canadians spend 3 percent of our health expenditures on administrative costs while the Germans spend 5 percent. The reason is simple: We have largely eliminated private insurance and bill the national health insurance plan directly for medical and hospital care.
When I had a heart attack and a double bypass operation some years ago, the only requirement was that I show my health insurance card to the hospital. Does anywhere in the United States provide the same efficiency in health care?
By contrast, the German system, as described by Dr. Daw, looks like American health care-lite -- easier to afford, but still afflicted with private insurers and the incredible weight of bureaucracy required to keep the system honest.
Harvey G. Simmons
Toronto
The writer is emeritus professor of political science at York University.
To the Editor:
Jamie Daw argues we can transition from Obamacare to Germany's universal health care system far more easily than we can persuade -- whom? -- to accept single payer. Poll after poll shows Americans long for a single-payer plan. But we cannot ignore the differences between a country that accepts limits on profiteering and one that celebrates any and all legal means of turning any "opportunity" into a buck.
As long as health insurance companies donate to politicians, we can't hope for a government that eliminates their profits. Without getting rid of for-profit health insurance, we cannot get the obscene expense of treating illness in this country down to manageable levels. In spite of Dr. Daw's optimism, we cannot transition from profitability to a system based on the values associated with compassion as long as health insurance companies continue to stand between us and the care we need to thrive.
Candida Pugh
Oakland, Calif.
To the Editor:
So let me see if I have this right: Because a German chancellor, Otto von Bismarck, came up with an inefficient way to provide universal health care almost 140 years ago, the United States should now copy his system?
There are too many flaws in Jamie Daw's case to enumerate in a short letter, but let me take just one: Dr. Daw states, "In Germany, sickness funds leverage market power to secure lower prices, coming together regionally to negotiate contracts with doctors and hospitals." In the United States, health insurance companies -- which are much larger and have much more market power than German sickness funds -- have had the ability to negotiate for lower prices for the better part of a century. The result has been what we have -- by far the most expensive health care system in the world.
What on earth makes Dr. Daw think that, with a snap of the fingers, this already existing market power will suddenly yield a better result? Private insurance companies add an extra layer of expense that is totally unnecessary. We can do better.
Wesley H. Clark
Middlebury, Vt.
The writer is an anesthesiologist.
To the Editor:
I am an American expat who has been living in Germany for many years and have intimate knowledge of and experience with its health care system. Jamie Daw's essay is not representative of the realities, pitfalls and serious systemic problems that exist in the German system and do not reflect the fact that most of the population is getting substandard care. Indeed, the German system is just as bad as the American system, just with a different set of failures that need to be addressed.
Stew Green
Brandscheid, Germany
To the Editor:
One important aspect of health care that Jamie Daw does not mention is the education of medical providers. The cost of medical school in Germany is a tiny fraction of the cost in the United States. Medical schools can cost as much as $75,000 per year, or $300,000 in total, for tuition, fees and living expenses. During the additional four to eight years of internship, residency and fellowship, young doctors are barely paid enough to cover basic housing and living costs. Most are not only acquiring substantial debt but also forgoing about 10 years of earning and saving.
This is a huge sacrifice. We should be asking ourselves how much longer the best and brightest students will choose this career path unless the cost of medical education is not so onerous.
Candace Singer
Port Washington, N.Y.
To the Editor:
Several important features of the Bismarckian model advocated by Jamie Daw are omitted from her description of the German health insurance system. First, all of the sickness funds are, by law, not for profit; to introduce this needed feature into the American capitalist system is as radical as single payer.
Second, people earning above a defined (inflation-adjusted) yearly amount of money are not required to join the sickness funds, and can either pay out of pocket or find other insurance; this group comprises about 10 percent of the working force.
Third, the system operates under a gatekeeper system, in which primary care providers refer to hospital-based secondary and tertiary care providers.
My point here is that adopting a Bismarckian system is not necessarily simpler for the United States than establishing single payer. It is possible that a hybrid homegrown model might be better than either.

Bad Number On Jobs Is Probably A Corrective

Full text: The clunker of a job growth report that the Labor Department published Friday morning is telling us something we should have already suspected.
Specifically, that recent blockbuster readings on U.S. job creation were a little too good to be true. American employers, while still adding to their payrolls, have not been on the epic hiring spree that previous reports had suggested.
So while the mere 20,000 jobs added in February (the lowest number since September 2017) is a big disappointment -- compared both with what economists had forecast and with recent hiring numbers -- it can be seen as a corrective to some of the more buoyant possibilities suggested by the same data series in late 2018 and January 2019.
Essentially, two of the last four months' hiring numbers (October and January) may have been statistical aberrations on the high side, and the terrible February number is most likely an aberration on the low end. Together, the average over the last few months is something more realistic, given where things stand in the decade-old economic expansion.
With a single report, the six-month average rate of job growth has fallen to 190,000 from 234,000. That lower number is a better fit with everything else we know about the state of the economy -- particularly a 3.8 percent unemployment rate and lots of anecdotal reports of scarce workers. Businesses can't add people to the payrolls who don't exist.
Add in the ample evidence that the overall rate of growth is shifting down as trade wars continue to disrupt industries and as the impact of tax cuts fade, and a more modest rate of job creation makes sense.
So job growth in the sub-200,000-a-month range seems a lot more plausible for the rest of 2019 -- and yet more deceleration is a strong possibility.
If you take that relatively Zen view of the job creation numbers, there's an awful lot else to like in the February numbers. Average hourly earnings rose 3.4 percent over the last year, the strongest in a decade. A broader measure of joblessness that captures people who are working part time but want full-time work plunged to 7.3 percent.
And the unemployment rate fell to 3.8 percent, from 4 percent, for benign reasons. More people were working and fewer were unemployed. The proportion of adults in the work force held steady, not improving further but also not giving back recent gains.
Essentially, the labor market is finally working the way we want it to, with most of the people who want a job getting one and employers finding the need to raise pay to get those increasingly hard-to-find workers.
This is a tricky report for the Federal Reserve, however. It certainly makes its January decision to put interest rate increases on indefinite hold look like a good one. The lower trend rate of job growth implied by the new number fits the story of a slowdown in the economic expansion over all.
But the wage numbers and falling unemployment rates both point to a tight job market that could create inflation pressures down the road. The central bank's chairman, Jerome Powell, has indicated that faster wage growth doesn't alarm him. And there's a good substantive case that the Fed should be cheering on faster wage growth, unless that growth shows clear signs of creating an outburst in overall inflation.
But if the February trend continues, it will be a test of those convictions, and the voices arguing that the Fed needs to resume its campaign of rate increases will become louder.
Soft job growth numbers aren't something to fear at this level of unemployment -- so long as that weak February number remains a one-time corrective to the recent trend, and not the start of something a lot worse.

Full text: The Bull Market Began 10 Years Ago. Why Aren't More People Celebrating?
By Matt Phillips
______
The financial system had nearly collapsed. The deepest recession in decades was devouring over 700,000 jobs a month. Roughly $13 trillion in stock market wealth, slowly rebuilt since the dot-com bust, had again been incinerated.
It was March 2009. And it was one of the best times in a generation to buy stocks.
A decade later, the bull market that began back then ranks among the great rallies in stock-market history. The 305 percent surge in the S&P 500 is the index's second-best run ever.
The rise has generated more than $30 trillion in wealth. Adjusted for inflation, that is the most created during any bull run on record, edging out the $25 trillion in gains during the epic streak from December 1987 to March 2000, which ended with the bursting of the dot-com bubble, according to Federal Reserve data.
But compared with Americans' attitudes during that earlier climb, reactions to the latest rally are downright subdued. There has been no frenzy for stock trading. Nobody is quitting a accounting, advertising, or waitressing job to concentrate on day trading.
Why so somber?
The psychological and financial damage inflicted by the 2008 financial crisis and the ensuing Great Recession continue to weigh heavily. Fewer people are invested in stocks than before that meltdown, and many of them are wary of taking their gains for granted. That caution could last for decades.
"This was probably the most disliked or most suspected rally that we've ever had in the stock market," said Charles Geisst, a professor at Manhattan College who has studied the history of financial markets.
Birth of the Bull
On March 9, 2009, the day the bull market was born, the stock market, like the economy, was in deep, seemingly existential distress. The S&P 500 was down 57 percent from its 2007 peak.
Compounding the pain was the nationwide collapse in home prices, which landed a direct hit on most households' greatest source of wealth.
The one-two punch destroyed the finances of millions of families. Between 2007 and 2010, the median wealth of a household in the United States dropped 44 percent, knocked below 1969 levels.
Every crash has a bottom, though, and in March 2009, the Federal Reserve announced that it would spend $1 trillion in newly created dollars on government and mortgage bonds to push interest rates lower. It was the dawn of "quantitative easing" -- and, it would turn out, a new bull market. The S&P 500 rose 8.5 percent that month, its best monthly performance in more than six years.
"That should have been the signal to everyone that you can go out there and buy stocks with impunity," said Byron Wien, vice chairman of the private wealth group at Blackstone, the private equity firm.
But to buy stocks, you need money. After watching their fortunes -- and retirement funds -- shrivel, few Americans were in a position to take a fresh flier on beaten-down stocks.
Those who could were already well-off. In 2007, the wealthiest 10 percent of American families owned 81 percent of the nation's household stock market wealth, according Ed Wolff, a professor of economics at New York University who studies the distribution of wealth in the United States. By 2016, they owned 84 percent, he said.
The recovery in the stock market made those families even richer, increasing their net worth by double-digit percentages. Median American family wealth, meanwhile, dropped 34 percent.
In the past, such episodes of wealth destruction cast long shadows. For much of the 20th century, the financial habits of the American public were heavily influenced by memories of the Great Depression.
Even in the 1960s, survey data showed that people who were young during the Great Depression were much less likely to invest in stocks, according to research by two economists, Ulrike Malmendier of the University of California, Berkeley, and Stefan Nagel of the University of Chicago.
The 2008 crisis was nowhere near as severe, but a similar dynamic may be affecting people who started their working lives around that time.
Gallup survey data shows that in the last decade, an average of 38 percent of Americans under the age of 35 have money invested in the stock market. That compares with 52 percent before the crisis.
Playing It Safe
Even those who are invested are behaving differently, both in how they invest and what they're doing with the proceeds.
In the decade since the bull market began, the share of Americans investing via index funds, which aim to mimic the performance of benchmarks like the S&P 500, has increased significantly.
In 2017, 43 percent of all the money in American stock market funds was in index funds. Back in 2007, only 19 percent of stock market assets were in these passive strategies, a style of investing that acknowledges that, for most people, trying to beat the market through savvy trading is a mug's game.
Americans also appear to be less willing than in previous booms to let the rise in stock market wealth on paper lead to a surge in spending. Family savings rates have stayed stubbornly high by historical standards.
"Households continue to kind of treat their capital gains, realized or unrealized, more cautiously than they did in the 1990s or the 2000s," said Michael Feroli, chief United States economist at J.P. Morgan.
In part, this is because many stock owners are baby boomers, who might have enjoyed spending their stock market gains 20 years ago but are now more worried about preserving wealth as they retire.
Fred Wallace, a 64-year-old retired HBO executive in Los Angeles is one of them. When the stock market took a dive in December, he cut his holdings of stock and moved money into cash and bonds.
"That allows you to sleep at night because you know that if stocks tank it doesn't really matter," Mr. Wallace said.
But even among Americans who are just starting their careers, this risk-aversion could linger.
Research from Ms. Malmendier and Mr. Nagel, the economists, suggests that enduring financial traumas at a relatively young age can shape people's behavior for decades. Younger Americans, Ms. Malmendier said, are unlikely to be eager to take big risks in the stock market any time soon.
"We don't see that happening," she said. "People were scarred from that experience."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text: FRANKFURT -- Just a few months ago, the European Central Bank put the brakes on a vast economic stimulus program devised during the financial crisis. On Thursday, it unexpectedly reversed course and revived some of the measures, signaling the rising threat of a recession.
The quick turnabout, from confidence to concern, reflects the broader weakness in the global economy. A slowdown in China, exacerbated by rising trade tensions with the United States, has reverberated around the world, dragging down growth in Europe and elsewhere.
The United States is Europe's largest trading partner, while China is an increasingly important market for its cars, pharmaceuticals and manufactured goods. The industrial powerhouse Germany barely escaped recession in the latest quarter, as the country's economy was battered by the American tariffs on its steel and waning Chinese appetite for its machine tools and Volkswagens.
Europe has been particularly vulnerable to global forces, given the turmoil at home. The uncertainty over Britain's exit from the European Union has put pressure on the British economy, while Italy and Spain have been shaken by their own political fissures.
The struggles abroad have the potential to blow back on the United States, which has been the star performer among global economies. History shows that the American economy cannot escape problems in Europe, given their deep commercial ties. And the Chinese slowdown amplifies the risks.
"We're looking at the potential for a synchronized slowdown of the global economy," said Carl B. Weinberg, chief international economist at High Frequency Economics.
Against that backdrop, the European Central Bank's Governing Council voted unanimously on Thursday to bring back a stimulus measure intended to encourage lending. The move will help banks in countries with weaker economies like Italy that may have trouble raising money on capital markets at reasonable rates.
The stimulus program was used to prevent collapse of the eurozone following the 2008 financial crisis. It allows commercial banks to borrow money from the central bank at zero interest, but they have to promise to lend the money to businesses or consumers.
Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, implicitly blamed White House policies for the economic damage behind the decision. "Lower confidence produced by the trade discussions" was a key cause of economic slowdowns in Europe, China and emerging markets, Mr. Draghi said at a news briefing. He added, though, that he did not expect a recession.
The bank also pushed back the date of its earliest possible increase in benchmark interest rates by at least four months, saying there would be no change until 2020. That means that Mr. Draghi will serve his full nine-year term without ever having overseen a rate increase. He leaves office at the end of October.
"The bank is saying, 'We are doing everything we can,"' said Florian Hense, an economist at Berenberg Bank in London.
The past decade had been rough for Europe.
The global financial crisis, which set off the European sovereign debt crisis, forced Mr. Draghi to unleash extraordinary stimulus measures to keep the eurozone from being torn apart. Mr. Draghi, who famously vowed to "do whatever it takes" to keep the bloc intact, oversaw a vast de facto money printing program in which the bank bought trillions of euros of government and corporate bonds.
Europe seemed to have finally turned a corner last year, and Mr. Draghi began cautiously unwinding its program of bond buying, a strategy known as quantitative easing. The bank stopped adding to its bond portfolio in December, and also set the stage for an increase in its key interest rates as early as this September.
Those moves were an expression of confidence that the world's major economies would shrug off President Trump's trade war and continue to grow strongly. But a few months later, the picture looks decidedly worse.
Italy is in recession and Germany came close. Britain's attempt to leave the European Union proved even more difficult and disruptive than expected.
Even the weather seemed to conspire against Europe. An unusually dry and hot summer caused the water level in the Rhine River to drop so low that barge traffic became impossible, disrupting transport of chemicals and fuel, causing shortages and driving up prices.
The timing of the overseas slowdown could not be worse from the United States' perspective. It's happening just as the American economy is expected to slow down after the economic high of the tax cuts that went into effect last year starts to wear off.
In that environment, the United States and its companies will be more dependent on the health of trading partners like Europe. "The U.S. needs the rest of the world a bit more than last year," said Brad W. Setser, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.
Economic weakness abroad can also send American stock markets into a tailspin.
In 2011, when investors feared that a wave of European governments and companies might default on their debts, American stocks fell nearly 20 percent from their highs. In 2015, the S&P 500 plunged after China's central bank made a surprise move that reduced the value of the country's currency against the dollar.
The sudden announcement by the European Central Bank on Thursday was out of character. Typically, the bank changes policy gradually and gives investors plenty of warning.
The bank also displayed an unusually high level of determination and unity. All of the members of the Governing Council supported the decisions on Thursday, Mr. Draghi said. That has not always been the case. During the crisis years the council, which includes central bankers from all 19 countries in the eurozone, was often divided on its response.
Still, the central bank is treading cautiously, waiting to see what happens with the economy. It did not take the more radical step of increasing its purchases of government and corporate bonds. That form of stimulus is associated with extreme stress and might have been taken as a sign of panic.
Mr. Draghi also emphasized on Thursday that the central bank never really ended the bond buying program in December -- it just stopped expanding it. When bonds in the bank's portfolio pay interest or the borrowers pay the money back, the bank will use the funds to buy more bonds. That means the holdings, valued at $2.8 trillion, will remain stable.
And Mr. Draghi said the central bank would do more if the economy took a turn for the worse. "We are very open to act and determined to act when it's needed," he said.
The bank's change of heart reflected the views of its in-house economists, who significantly lowered their forecasts for growth and inflation. They now expect eurozone growth in 2019 to be 1.1 percent, rather than the 1.7 percent growth they were forecasting only a few months ago.
The moves provided a short-lived jolt to European stock markets. The major indexes, which had been lower for the day, briefly jumped into positive territory. But any euphoria about the stimulus may have been outweighed by the realization that the central bank is more worried about the economy than investors thought. Stocks slumped in Europe and, later in the day, on Wall Street.
"Today's announcements have some flavor of panic," Carsten Brzeski, chief economist at ING Germany, said in a note to clients.

Full text: SEOUL, South Korea -- When the armored train carrying Kim Jong-un back from his summit meeting with President Trump in Vietnam reached Pyongyang Station at 3:08 a.m. Tuesday, throngs of flower-waving North Koreans greeted their leader with "boundless emotions and excitement," the country's state-run media said.
But Mr. Kim returned home empty-handed -- without relief from international sanctions -- prompting the question of what he will do next: Particularly, will he resume his nuclear and missile brinkmanship to reassert his leverage?
The revelation on Wednesday that North Korea had started rebuilding the partly dismantled facilities at Tongchang-ri, where the country tests technologies for its intercontinental ballistic missiles, raised the specter that Mr. Kim was returning to his provocative behavior.
But experts on North Korea say Mr. Kim may be boxed in: He returned home without sanctions relief amid strong signs that the North Korean economy is continuing to contract. The deepening economic trouble may force the country to return to the negotiating table.
In restarting operations at its missile technology site, North Korea is seeking "to increase its leverage before the next round of talks," said Koh Yu-hwan, a professor of North Korean studies at Dongguk University in Seoul.
"I don't think the North will resume missile tests anytime soon and risk the resumption of United States-South Korea joint military exercises and even the talk of a military option by the Americans," he said.
Mr. Trump expressed his displeasure at the prospect of new testing. "I would be very disappointed if that were happening," the president said at the White House on Wednesday when asked about reports on the North Korean missile facilities. "It's a very early report, and we're the ones that put it out. But I would be very, very disappointed in Chairman Kim. And I don't think I will be, but we'll see what happens. We'll take a look. It'll ultimately get solved."
The two-day Hanoi summit meeting ended last week without any agreement on the terms of denuclearizing North Korea, dashing Mr. Kim's hopes that he could persuade Washington to lift the most punishing sanctions against his country in return for a partial dismantlement of its nuclear program.
Officially, both sides remain committed to dialogue, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo expressing hope that the United States will send a delegation to North Korea "in the next couple weeks." And this week, Washington canceled two major joint military exercises with South Korea to keep the diplomatic momentum alive.
But in a telling sign of disappointment, the official Korean Central News Agency's report on Mr. Kim's return home made no mention of "comprehensive and epoch-making results" that it had earlier said Mr. Kim was discussing with Mr. Trump in Hanoi.
"The Hanoi summit was a knockout defeat for Kim Jong-un," said Lee Seong-hyon, an analyst at the Sejong Institute near Seoul. "The Kim-Trump romance may be short-lived, especially if Trump determines that playing hardball and cornering Kim Jong-un is popular in the run-up to his next election campaign. In Hanoi, Trump learned how desperate Kim is to ease sanctions."
After the breakdown of the Hanoi talks, Mr. Kim faced growing doubts at home that he could deliver on his promise to revive his country's troubled economy and keep his long-suffering people from having to "tighten their belt again."
Mr. Kim may engineer a political purge to keep the elites under control and reassert his authority, Mr. Lee said. He may also reshuffle his negotiating team, replacing Kim Yong-chol, a former spy chief who has led negotiations with Washington, with more seasoned Foreign Ministry diplomats, Mr. Lee said.
"The greatest achievement" of the Hanoi summit meeting "was to clearly prove that there is no potential for convergence between the current North Korean and American trajectories toward North Korea's denuclearization," said Ha Young-sun, a prominent South Korean expert on North Korea, in a column posted on Global North Korea, a Seoul-based website specializing in the North.
If North Korea does not correct its course, "the regime will face a second 'Arduous March,"' Mr. Ha said, referring to a famine in the 1990s that may have killed millions of North Koreans.
It remains difficult to measure how much North Korea is hurt by sanctions. The United Nations has warned that the country is benefiting from sanctions loopholes, conducting ship-to-ship transfers of oil and other banned goods, with the help of Chinese and Russian entities.
But Mr. Kim's insistence on sanctions relief during his meeting with Mr. Trump suggested that North Korea has begun feeling pains of sanctions in a way it had never before or that Mr. Kim sees sanctions as the biggest obstacle to his ambitious plan to rebuild the economy.
On Wednesday, United Nations and Red Cross officials said that North Korea's food production last year had fallen to its lowest level in more than a decade, as a prolonged heat wave, along with typhoon and floods, caused the food harvest to drop 9 percent.
Maize yields fell more than 30 percent from average levels in some areas, and rice prices are likely to rise this year, aggravating the food security situation, Margareta Wahlstrom, the president of the Swedish Red Cross, told Reuters.
That has resulted in a "significant food gap," leaving around 3.8 million North Koreans in urgent need of humanitarian assistance worth $120 million, according to Tapan Mishra, the United Nations resident coordinator in the North, Reuters said.
Since taking power in 2011, Mr. Kim has focused on reviving the economy, allowing more market activities, as well as kicking off a building boom in Pyongyang and in potential tourist zones on the country's east coast and near its scenic Mount Baekdu. At the same time, he accelerated his country's nuclear and missile program, proudly announcing in 2017 that he had completed nuclear-armed ICBMs.
But it came with a heavy cost.
Since North Korea conducted its fourth nuclear test in 2016, the United Nations Security Council has drastically tightened the noose around the North Korean economy, banning all of its key exports, such as coal, textiles and fisheries, and limiting its ability to import oil.
After steady growth under Mr. Kim, the country's economy contracted 3.5 percent in 2017 because of sanctions, according to South Korea's central bank. It may have contracted 5 percent last year, South Korean economists say.
North Korean exports to China plummeted 88 percent to $210 million last year, according to Chinese customs data. China accounts for more than 93 percent of North Korea's external trade.
The widening trade deficit with China -- it grew 30 percent last year -- threatens the country's hard-currency reserves and its ability to stock its markets and state-run stores with Chinese imports to keep inflation in check, analysts said.
During the Hanoi summit meeting, Mr. Kim made a bold offer by North Korean standards. He offered to dismantle its facilities at Yongbyon, which his country has operated as its main nuclear research and nuclear fuel production complex since the 1980s. In return, he asked Mr. Trump to lift the sanctions imposed since 2016 that have strangled the North Korean economy.
But Mr. Trump demanded that the North do more, seeking a more comprehensive denuclearization agreement, rather than an incremental deal in which Washington give up the sanctions leverage it has built over the years.
"I'd much rather do it right than do it fast," Mr. Trump said.
His strategy stymies Mr. Kim's plans to improve the economy and strengthen the legitimacy of his family's dynastic rule. But time is not necessarily on Washington's side, Mr. Koh said.
"Sanctions certainly hurt, but they will not make the regime collapse or surrender," he said. "As talks remain stalemated, the North will keep running its nuclear program and produce more fissile materials for more nuclear warheads."

Iran's Foreign Minister Stays in His Post, Despite Lingering Frustrations

Full text: BEIRUT, Lebanon -- The surprise resignation of Iran's foreign minister last week was a rare public display of the jockeying between hard-liners and the more moderate camp within the clerical leadership, a divide that has been exacerbated by the country's deepening economic crisis, analysts said.
Hard-liners have long had the edge. But Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif's open show of frustration was a sign that he and his ally, President Hassan Rouhani, find themselves further weakened after the collapse of their biggest foreign policy project -- the 2015 nuclear deal with the United States and other world powers.
The further empowerment of the hard-liners could presage even more tense relations with the United States and worsen Iran's economic crisis, fueling instability.
"Since the U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear deal, Zarif is suffering," said Talal Atrissi, a sociology professor at the Lebanese University in Beirut who studies Iran and its regional allies. The foreign minister, he said, "strongly believed in dialogue and negotiations with U.S., but the cancellation of the deal showed that the strategy that Zarif was following wasn't correct."
At issue is which camp within the clerical leadership has more clout in foreign affairs. Under Mr. Zarif, the foreign ministry has advocated greater engagement with the West as the key to Iran's future, a view opposed by hard-liners who see the West as an irredeemable enemy that must be challenged.
Competition between the two camps has grown since President Trump pulled the United States out of the nuclear agreement last year and reimposed sanctions on Iran, setting off steep inflation and a rise in unemployment.
Ali Vaez, the director of the Iran project at the International Crisis Group, met with Mr. Zarif last month before his resignation and said he seemed frustrated that initiatives that he cared about appeared blocked. That frustration boiled over last week, when he was not informed of a state visit by President Bashar al-Assad of Syria until it was over.
"I think he was looking for a pretext and I think the way he was treated with the Assad visit was quite insulting for any foreign minister," Mr. Vaez said. "This was the last straw for Zarif. It was an emotional reaction."
The president rejected Mr. Zarif's resignation, leaving the foreign minister in his post for now. But the issue cropped up again on Tuesday when a foreign ministry spokesman said the resignation had been intended to protest the sidelining of "the diplomatic system."
Mr. Assad, making the first visit by one of Iran's closest Arab allies in nine years, was granted an audience with the hard-line supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei -- the most powerful figure in the country. Another leading hard-liner, Qassem Soleimani, was also in the room. He is the head of the Quds Force, the foreign branch of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.
Mr. Zarif resigned soon after in a lyrical post on his Instagram account, apologizing "for all the shortcomings during my service."
In rejecting the resignation, President Rouhani said it was "against national interests" and hailed Mr. Zarif as a "trustworthy, brave and religious" person. General Soleimani also issued a rare statement saying Mr. Zarif's absence had been because of a "bureaucratic" mistake.
That appeared to put the issue to rest until Tuesday, when the Foreign Ministry spokesman, Bahram Qassemi, said that the ministry had no knowledge of Mr. Assad's trip until it was over.
Among the reasons for Mr. Zarif's resignation was "this type of lack of coordination," Mr. Qassemi said, adding that the move was intended as "a positive effort to return the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the diplomatic system of the country to its main place," according to the Iranian Students' News Agency.
Mr. Zarif and General Soleimani represent two different streams in Iranian foreign policy that often overlap but sometimes compete.
Mr. Zarif was educated in the United States, speaks fluent English, served as the Iranian ambassador to the United Nations and regularly appears at international conferences to defend his country and its policies. He has pushed for greater ties with the West and was one of the main architects of the Iran nuclear deal.
Mr. Trump's withdrawal from the nuclear agreement was a blow to relative moderates like Mr. Zarif and Mr. Rouhani. But Mr. Zarif has worked to maintain as much of the deal as possible with Europe while also advocating moves that would give Iran greater access to the international financial system, efforts that now appear to be in jeopardy.
General Soleimani has long been a shadowy figure in charge of Iran's often secretive military operations abroad. These include maintaining ties with Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant group and political party, and other militias in Syria, Iraq and elsewhere.
General Soleiman's star has risen as Iran has exploited the chaos that followed the Arab Spring uprisings to expand its influence. Photos of the silver-haired general now pop up regularly on social media, showing him visiting Iranian-aligned forces in different conflicts across the Middle East.
Iran and the militias it backs played a critical role in helping Mr. Assad turn the tide against rebels seeking to oust him in the early years of Syria's civil war. And General Soleimani visited Russia in the summer of 2015, before Russia also intervened militarily in the war, leading to a string of rebel defeats and strengthening ties between Russia and Iran.
The inner workings of Iran's government are often opaque.
Some analysts suspected that Mr. Zarif's resignation was a gambit to strengthen his position by forcing public endorsements from the country's other top power brokers. But those statements of support are unlikely to restore Mr. Zarif's clout on key foreign issues, said Henry Rome, an Iran analyst at the Eurasia Group, a Washington-based political risk consultancy.
And Mr. Zarif's move has little chance of meaningfully improving his ministry's stature in foreign policy decision-making -- especially in Syria, which has long been outside of the diplomats' remit, he said.
While the office of the foreign minister has never been very powerful in Iran, it is less likely to be so during a time of multiple crises, said Karim Sadjadpour, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who studies Iran.
"As long as the Islamic Republic is faced with internal and external insecurity, the security forces of the country will be in the driver's seat, not civilians," Mr. Sadjadpour said.

Full text: WILMINGTON, Del. -- Tom Vari's lighting suppliers began mailing him warnings about tariffs last fall. They varied a bit in dates and percentages, but they all said the same thing: Very soon, your prices are going up.
Mr. Vari owns Brandywine Lighting Gallery, a 2,000-square-foot independent showroom on a busy highway north of Wilmington. Almost everything he sells is made in China, meaning that since September, his products have been subject to a 10 percent tax on Chinese imports levied by the Trump administration. So far, Mr. Vari has largely absorbed those costs, by accepting lower profits. But he -- and his suppliers -- say they won't be able to shield customers from dramatic price increases much longer.
President Trump insists that his trade war will make America better off and that until it's resolved, China is paying billions of dollars in tariffs to the United States. But it is small-business owners like Mr. Vari, and his customers, who are largely footing the bill for Mr. Trump's tariffs. As the trade war reaches into its second year, companies and consumers across the United States are growing weary. Small businesses like Brandywine Lighting have been forced to adapt to new economic realities brought about by Mr. Trump's trade fight with China, Europe, Canada and Mexico and those companies are now beginning to chafe as the fight drags on, putting their profitability at risk.
The United States and China are moving closer to a deal that would roll back tariffs on both sides of the Pacific, while requiring the Chinese to buy more American goods and make some changes to its trade practices. While details are still being discussed, the agreement does not appear to require the sweeping changes to China's economy that prompted Mr. Trump to begin the trade war.
For Mr. Vari, a resolution could not come soon enough. If no deal is reached, he is worried that he will be priced out of the market by bigger competitors who can more easily absorb the tariffs costs and not pass them along to customers.
"I have to make a decision, if I am going to raise my prices, or I'm going to hold my prices, so people realize I'm trying to help them," Mr. Vari said. "Help only goes so far, when you're a mom-and-pop store like this."
Mr. Trump initially imposed tariffs on $50 billion in Chinese imports last spring, in retaliation for trade practices that Mr. Trump said hurt American jobs and industries. He added tariffs on an additional $200 billion worth of goods in late September, including on many home goods such as lighting supplies. The president initially threatened to raise tariffs on that second tranche to 25 percent from 10 percent on March 2, but much to Mr. Vari's relief, the president agreed last month to delay that increase, citing progress in the talks.
So far, the tariffs on Chinese goods have yet to translate into large price increases across the United States economy: Researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco estimated that China tariffs have added 0.1 percent to inflation for consumers and 0.3 percent for business investment goods.
But there are signs that the tariffs have raised prices for Americans who buy imported lighting. The Labor Department reports monthly inflation statistics for "clocks, lamps and decorator items" in the United States. Like many consumer goods, those items have experienced steady deflation over the last decade -- meaning they're either getting cheaper, or they are improving in value, or both. From 2008 to 2018, the Consumer Price Index for those goods fell by an average of 6 percent a year.
That trend reversed once tariffs took effect. From September of 2018 to January this year, the price index rose by 2.7 percent.
A much sharper increase could be on the way, if the letters from Mr. Vari's suppliers are an indication.
He has been collecting them for months here at his store, which employs four full-timers and one part-timer. The showroom is packed with hundreds of chandeliers, floor lamps, bath fixtures, bed fixtures and glowing guides for outdoor walkways. There is no warehouse attached, which means he stocks one, maybe two, of everything customers see here. He has stacks of catalogs they can order from if they'd like more options.
In an industry increasingly dominated by online retailers and big-box stores, Brandywine's business model is customer service: Employees here will spend hours, if needed, helping customers decide on the right fixture. Those on the fence can take a light home to try it out, no obligation to buy.
Still, Mr. Vari must keep his prices competitive -- and his margins healthy enough to pay his bills. That's why the letters from suppliers concerned him this fall. "Price increase announcement," one read, explaining that the September wave of tariffs would push up costs of several brands by 6 percent. "I can only hope that the trade war ceases before another 15 percent tariff increase goes into effect," another said. Some of his invoices began breaking out a "tariff per unit" so Mr. Vari could see what the trade war was already costing him.
In the early letters, suppliers said they were absorbing some of the tariff costs themselves. But they have increasingly warned store owners to stock up on inventory ahead of any further escalation, which the letters say will be almost entirely passed on as price increases. Big-box retailers have the money and the shelf space to stock up. Mr. Vari does not.
He has shielded some, but not all, customers from price increases so far. The decision is all about margins. Mr. Vari said he couldn't afford to absorb tariff costs on everyday home lighting, where industry competition is higher and profit margins are already low. Their prices have risen in his showroom, so that every sale does not actually cost him money.
Mr. Vari's bigger margins come from large-scale lighting projects, like kitchen renovations and landscaping. He has not raised prices there yet, because he does not want to drive away customers, viewing it as a trade-off between lower profits today for a larger clientele in the long-run. If the tariffs rise again, however, he will have to raise those prices.
"We'll still be O.K.," Mr. Vari said, "because I won't be a pig about it."
But he worries, he said, about "customers never pulling the trigger" if a large project suddenly costs $1,000 more than it would have.
Mr. Vari has been in the lighting business, in one way or another, for 40 years. He recalls when a large share of the products he sold were made in the United States. That was the 1980s, before the industry migrated to China.
What is left of the domestic lighting industry today, he said, is so high-end that he cannot afford to stock it. "Great products," Mr. Vari said. "But the whole idea of bringing the industry back here? That's what it will be. High-paid people. High-paid producers. And only the rich will be able to afford them."
Mr. Trump's promises to bring that type of manufacturing back to the United States are "political bullcrap," Mr. Vari said. "Some people believe that just because Trump's pressuring China, we're going to be an industrial powerhouse again. It's not going to happen."
Mr. Vari recently warned customers about the impact of tariffs in a social media post, where he said Mr. Trump's actions were going to make lighting more expensive. It drew immediate criticism from Mr. Trump's supporters. "The haters came like that," Mr. Vari said. "I'll never do a post like that again."
Instead, he is spreading the word about price increases in traditional small-business fashion: owner to customer, one person at a time.

As Trump Moves to End Trade War With China, Business Asks: Was It Worth It?

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The pain of President Trump's trade war with China may soon be over, but American businesses and farmers are left wondering whether it was worth the trouble.
Negotiations with the Chinese are continuing, and Mr. Trump could still secure more concessions to balance out a trading relationship he has long criticized as unfair. But details of the emerging deal paint a familiar picture of Beijing making vague promises to change its economic practices that could be easy to delay and difficult to enforce.
While previous administrations have tried to cajole China into changing its behavior, Mr. Trump has used a blunt instrument: deploying punishing tariffs to win concessions. That has given the United States a remarkable amount of leverage, but it has also taken a heavy toll on farmers, automakers, manufacturers and other businesses with exposure to China. Those businesses have faced higher costs, reduced access to the Chinese market and retaliation, including tariffs on American goods. Some farmers have permanently lost customers and contracts in China, while the profits -- and share prices -- of multinational businesses have taken a significant hit.
Now, with the United States poised to roll back most of its tariffs as the two countries close in on a final agreement, the question is whether the costs of Mr. Trump's deal-making outweigh the benefits.
"Can we go back to the pretariff days? Yes, we can," said Derek Scissors, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. "Have we moved the bar since the beginning of the Trump administration? The answer is no."
Over the past several weeks, American and Chinese negotiators have been in almost constant contact over phone and video conferencing to hammer out the terms of a deal. China has agreed to drop the retaliatory tariffs it imposed to counter Mr. Trump's levies on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods and to provide greater access to its markets for cars, beef, chemicals and other products.
Beijing has pledged to have Chinese companies purchase hundreds of billions of dollars worth of liquefied natural gas, soybeans and other goods over a number of years to appease Mr. Trump's focus on the bilateral trade deficit. China is also rewriting some of its laws and regulations to better protect foreign intellectual property, ban the forced transfer of foreign technology to Chinese business partners and codify equal treatment of foreign companies.
In return, China wants Mr. Trump to drop all the tariffs he imposed over the past year, which have begun to hamper the Chinese economy. While any final decision will fall to the president, people familiar with the negotiations say the United States is willing to scrap tariffs on at least $200 billion worth of goods, if not all.
The tariff dÃ©tente would help large and small companies that have struggled under the weight of 10 percent and 25 percent levies, but the trade war has already come at a cost. Several recent studies have shown modest but growing damage to the United States economy from the trade war, including the retaliatory tariffs other countries have leveled against American exports.
And contrary to Mr. Trump's claim that the Chinese are paying the tariffs, several studies show they are being passed on to American consumers in the form of higher prices on imported goods.
Mr. Trump's tariffs "were almost completely passed through into U.S. domestic prices," the economists Mary Amiti of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Stephen J. Redding of Princeton University and David Weinstein of Columbia University wrote in a paper released late last week, "so that the entire incidence of the tariffs fell on domestic consumers and importers up to now, with no impact so far on the prices received by foreign exporters."
The economists concluded that tariffs had already reduced incomes in the United States by nearly $7 billion, and that the total cost to the economy had been even larger, because of price increases. By the end of last year, they estimate, the tariffs were costing consumers and importers a total of nearly $4.5 billion a month.
That effect is relatively small for a $20.5 trillion economy, but the researchers expect it to expand if the tariffs persist, as companies reroute supply chains to avoid tariffs in the United States and abroad.
Researchers from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco estimated last week that Mr. Trump's tariffs on imports from China have raised consumer price inflation by 0.1 percent in the United States. Researchers from the New York Fed estimate that the China tariffs -- along with tariffs on steel, aluminum, washing machines and solar panels -- boosted consumer prices by about a third of a percent last year.
Another study, from the researchers Ned Hill and Fran Stewart at Ohio State University, found that the economic drag from tariffs had at least partially offset stimulus from Mr. Trump's signature tax cuts. Rising trade uncertainty has chilled business investment growth: The researchers surveyed nearly 500 Ohio manufacturers and found that two-thirds of them said they were hurt by tariffs.
A survey from economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, the University of Chicago and Stanford University in January concluded that tariffs reduced business investment in the United States by 1.2 percent -- or $32.5 billion -- in 2018.
That price might be worth it, business groups and China analysts say, if the administration makes a deal that substantively transforms Chinese industrial policy and gives American companies fair and reciprocal access to the Chinese market.
"We oppose the use of tariffs, period," said Myron Brilliant, the executive vice president and head of international affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. "But we are at the same time supportive of this administration trying to get a deal that is not just consequential for today but will have lasting impact on the relationship and put the U.S.-China relationship on a better track."
"Absent a deal, I think everyone loses," he added.
But the deal under discussion, which could be wrapped up by late March, appears likely to fall short of the high expectations the Trump administration initially set and the significant changes critics say are needed to counter years of unfair economic behavior by China.
China promised to make its economy more market-oriented when it joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, and it has reiterated those promises many times since then, including in 2013.
Yet today the state has an even heavier hand in the economy than a decade ago, said Nicholas Lardy, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. The ruling Communist Party can influence private companies at will, and foreign companies face a variety of forms of discrimination that advantage Chinese firms.
Now, China is offering changes to its laws, including a significant rewrite of a law governing foreign investment. This is a necessary first step, Mr. Lardy said, but rewriting the laws may not do much good when the party is fundamentally above the law.
"Talking about rule of law and protecting property rights is one thing, but actually following through on it is a very difficult thing for a system where the party has been so deeply embedded for a long time and the rule of law is secondary," Mr. Lardy said.
China experts say certain provisions of the deal, including the administration's plan for airing disputes through an extensive series of meetings at various levels of government, sound similar to past economic dialogues during the administrations of George W. Bush and Barack Obama.
"We won't know until we see what the deal looks like, but it's feeling eerily familiar," said Scott Kennedy, a China scholar at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
Critics of the evolving deal have also said it suffers from a lack of specificity on certain provisions that China uses to systematically block foreign companies. For example, China is pledging not to discriminate against foreign companies when it sets new standards for technological equipment. And it is promising not to selectively use its antitrust laws against foreign companies or subsidize certain high-tech industries. But the deal under discussion does not provide a specific list of subsidies that would be curtailed or ended, so the Chinese may just be able to rebrand them and evade the letter of the agreement.
Getting China to commit to changes on these issues would be a herculean task for any administration, Mr. Kennedy said. But the effort has been made harder by Mr. Trump's rush for a deal and his desire to act unilaterally rather than with other countries.
"It's difficult no matter what," Mr. Kennedy said. "We tried multilateralism and patient integration, and that didn't go smoothly either."

Full text: The Venezuelan political opposition and its many foreign supporters, the United States first among them, gambled that getting crucial humanitarian aid into the country would undermine military support for NicolÃ¡s Maduro and finally pry him out of the presidential palace. Alas, the first round failed recently. Despite some reported defections, the army blocked the aid at border crossings, often with violent confrontations.
Now what?
The easy part is to identify approaches best avoided. President Trump claims he has a Plan B, "and C, and D, and E, and F" to evict Mr. Maduro, but the only one he has raised is military intervention. His hawkish lieutenants at the White House may support that, but it is a dangerous idea opposed by most of the 50 countries that have joined the United States in recognizing the opposition leader, Juan GuaidÃ³, as the interim president of Venezuela. Whatever Venezuelan soldiers may think of Mr. Maduro, the deplorable history of United States interventions in the Americas could well unite them -- and many Venezuelans -- against another one.
More sanctions are another possibility. But the United States imposed new sanctions against Venezuela's state-owned oil company in January, further reducing what little remains of the country's oil income. Prolonged and expanded sanctions, while achieving the goal of depriving the government of cash, would also impose more suffering on a population already on the brink, with desperate shortages of food and medicine and runaway inflation.
And a dictator who has already destroyed his country -- and has the support of Russia and China -- is not one who gives a fig for the suffering of his people, a sizable portion of whom still harbor an attachment to the "Bolivarian socialist" claptrap of his predecessor and mentor, Hugo ChÃ¡vez.
The best outcome would be a negotiated deal between Mr. GuaidÃ³ and Mr. Maduro, possibly mediated by the United Nations, leading to free, internationally monitored elections. But for Mr. Maduro and his cronies, that is tantamount to surrendering power. The embattled president has fought back by depicting Mr. GuaidÃ³ as a stooge of Washington and its right-wing allies in Latin America, an optic Mr. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence have assisted by inveighing against "socialism" as an evil to be crushed wherever it appears.
Whether Mr. Trump has options other than military meddling or more sanctions is anybody's guess. So far, the United States has done well to stay clear of any threatening military moves. Along with the Europeans, Canada and above all the Latin American states that have declared Mr. Maduro's rule illegitimate, it must maintain united and constant pressure on Mr. Maduro to leave, and on the army to abandon him.
It must be clear that Mr. GuaidÃ³ should be installed as interim leader only to allow for new, fair elections. Any suggestion that Mr. GuaidÃ³ was acting on behalf of Washington would undermine that message.
It may take more time, and it may require cutting a deal with Mr. Maduro that would grant him and his cronies safe passage to refuge elsewhere, but maintaining a vociferous front of the Venezuelan opposition and a broad array of countries of all ideological leanings remains, for now, the best available option.

Full text: At long last, New York is getting what it deserves: broad agreement from Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio to address the subway crisis that has frustrated millions of people and hobbled the economy of the largest city in the United States.
The two men, both Democrats, have wasted years in a damaging rivalry that has stymied progress on crucial infrastructure, like mass transit and housing. On Tuesday, they overcame their animus and released a plan to raise revenue for long overdue subway repairs and to reform the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs the subways, buses and the region's commuter rails.
At the heart of the proposal is a version of congestion pricing, which Mr. de Blasio finally backed outright for the first time -- reason enough to cheer. Also included in the proposal are revenue from planned sales taxes on marijuana -- which the Legislature is expected to legalize soon in the state -- and money from an internet sales tax. The plan calls for loosely limiting fare increases to inflation of no more than 2 percent a year.
State and city officials said the $1.4 billion a year raised by the plan could be used to back bonds of $20 billion to $22 billion over five years, roughly the estimate of many advocates of congestion pricing as well. According to a news release from the governor and mayor, those new funds would be dedicated to the M.T.A.'s capital needs, "with priority given to the subway system." Fare increases would go toward running the subways and buses.
Now, state legislators will have to approve the plan, but votes for congestion pricing could be hard to come by. It will be up to the governor, as well as the State Senate majority leader, Andrea Stewart-Cousins, and the Assembly speaker, Carl Heastie, to persuade their colleagues of its merits. This latest plan still leaves several details to be determined, but concessions have already been made -- for example, it doesn't include tolls on East River bridges, as past versions have, instead digitally collecting a fee only on vehicles that enter the busiest part of Manhattan, below 61st Street. The mayor can use his bully pulpit to push for the plan.
As the legislation takes shape in the coming weeks, there are several other things to look out for:
â  While avoiding tolls on the East River bridges may make the plan more appealing to state lawmakers and others, it also leaves money on the table that the transit system needs.
â  The subways serve the most riders and are in the gravest state of disrepair. They need the most help. Because of that, the legislation ought to include a guarantee that an overwhelming majority of money generated by this plan will be permanently allocated for the subway system. The rest of the money, say 20 percent, could be used to upgrade commuter rails and improve service in so-called transit deserts in the boroughs outside Manhattan.
â  The proposal calls for the consolidation of the six entities within the M.T.A., a smart move that could cut costs and make the authority more efficient. Yet finding the deepest savings may require the state to renegotiate contracts with transit unions to change work rules. Ultimately, it may also mean consolidating the workforces of the Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North Railroad. And as the state changes the way contracts for major projects are negotiated -- a needed fix -- there should be far more transparency about bidding and procurement processes. More transparency is also needed around where the agency's dollars actually go, and how they benefit subway riders compared with commuter rail passengers. An independent audit called for under the proposal is a good place to begin, but the public should be able to easily review these figures in the long-term as well.
â  State lawmakers may want to consider adding other sources of revenue. Reinstating the 0.45 percent commuter tax on the incomes of people who live in the New York suburbs would be one good idea. A former M.T.A. chairman has said the agency contributes seven times more to each Long Island Rail Road ride, and four times more to each Metro-North Railroad ride, than to each subway ride. Another idea worth considering is to tax second homes in New York City worth $5 million or more, known as the pied-Ã -terre tax.
â  Does the M.T.A. need to create a six-member oversight board for capital construction and congestion pricing, as the proposal suggests? It's an idea that deserves careful consideration, especially since the purpose of the restructuring is to create clear accountability for the agency, not add more bureaucracy.
So there is work to do. But this latest proposal from the governor and the mayor is also the first sign that New York's elected officials may indeed be capable of rising to meet the state's most pressing challenges. Let's hope the Legislature is, too.

Full text: A month after Jack Bogle's death, evidence of the good things he wrought continues to arrive, sometimes from unexpected places.
Jack created Vanguard as a penny-pinching institution owned by its funds' shareholders. He popularized low-cost index funds and, in the process, radically reduced the expenses incurred by millions of rank-and-file investors.
Now, it turns out, cost savings from various types of index funds, run by Vanguard, BlackRock, Fidelity, Schwab, State Street and others, are having a measurable impact on inflation much as prices for groceries and gasoline do.
In January alone, the Bureau of Labor Statistics found, overall portfolio management costs in the United States "plunged 5.2 percent," Michael Feroli, the chief United States economist at J. P. Morgan, said in a note on Feb. 14.
Until then, I hadn't realized that the government tracked management expenses paid by investors. But Mr. Feroli set me straight. He said the effect of falling fees was great enough to make a difference in inflation numbers broadly.
In an email, he said most of the decline in portfolio costs, which the Bureau of Labor Statistics incorporates in the Producer Price Index, could be attributed to cuts in fund fees. That includes traditional mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, a type of index fund.
Index funds generally take a humble approach, mirroring the performance of the markets and not trying to beat them, as actively managed funds do. The simplicity of index funds typically leads to cost savings, which have helped to make them popular.
The decline in fund costs in January, Mr. Feroli said, will probably subtract "several basis points" -- a basis point is 0.01 percent -- from inflation, as measured by the core Personal Consumption Expenditures index. That is the Federal Reserve's preferred metric for setting interest rates.
That may not seem like much of a drop. But for core inflation, which affects just about everyone, it is. "Every basis point matters," Mr. Feroli said.
The cost of investing, the government said, dropped along with the price of everyday items like fresh fruit and gasoline, outweighing the impact of price increases in categories like machinery and equipment parts.
The plunge in investing costs continues a long-running trend that Jack Bogle helped to put in motion. From the beginning, Vanguard took pride in its rock-bottom fees the way other companies bragged about their handsome profits.
By now, so many investors have flocked to Vanguard's low-cost funds that many other companies offer them as well. A virtuous cycle has taken hold, much as Jack hoped.
The average fee paid by stock index fund investors plummeted nearly 40 percent in the decade that ran through December, Morningstar data shows. Fees for actively managed stock funds dropped about half that amount, and in December, they were still more than five times as high as those associated with index funds.
The shift to index funds has translated into big savings for individual investors. Imagine, for a moment, that you had $ 100,000 to invest in a retirement account. If you held the money in an actively managed stock fund that charged the average fee for 2008, you would have paid $ 927.06 a year in fees. At the average fee for an index funds in December 2018, on the other hand, your annual fee would have been only $ 141.83 a year, a savings of $ 785.23.
Over the course of a decade, a huge number of people took advantage of those savings by moving from actively managed to index funds.
In December 2008, new Morningstar data shows, only 19.8 percent of mutual fund assets in the United States were in index funds. Ten years later, the proportion had almost doubled, to 38.7 percent. And two companies that emphasize index funds -- Vanguard and BlackRock (including its iShares E.T.F.s, which BlackRock acquired in 2009) -- grew to dominate the industry.
By December 2018, Vanguard accounted for 24.8 percent of all stock and bond mutual fund assets in the United States, according to Morningstar. And Vanguard and BlackRock together controlled more than 34 percent of those assets. The two companies continue to attract enormous sums of money around the world: $ 176 billion flowed into Vanguard last year; $ 167 billion went to BlackRock. Fidelity was a "distant third' with $ 24 billion, Morningstar said.
"In effect, we are living in a Vanguard-BlackRock duopoly," said Kevin McDevitt, a senior analyst with Morningstar. The two are so big that everyone else must respond to them, he said, often by slashing costs.
Last summer, Fidelity announced that it was cutting fees to zero for some of its mutual funds. Charles Schwab quickly followed suit. Now, Fidelity and Schwab are offering broad arrays of exchange-traded funds that may be bought and sold without commissions, competing with Vanguard, which already does so.
That's why the index fund revolution hasn't been a blessing for all profit-making asset management companies. Revenue that would have swelled corporate coffers has instead remained in the pockets of people who shifted their savings into low-cost funds.
Companies that focus on actively managed funds with higher fees have had a hard time over the same period. For example, investors pulled $ 44 billion out of Franklin Templeton in 2018, Morningstar estimated. Partly because of that, the company's parent, Franklin Resources, reported a sharp decline in earnings per share, to $ 1.39 in 2018 from $ 3.01 in 2017, according to public filings.
From other perspectives, the effects of low-cost index funds may not turn out to be entirely positive. The implications of concentrating market power in the hands of a few giant investment companies have yet to be fully understood.
But the benefits are clear. For consumers, paying less for a bag of apples or a gallon of gas is a good thing. So is paying less for the privilege of owning a piece of the stock or bond market. As costs drop, Jack Bogle's legacy lives on.

Full text: Here are three things that have happened so far in 2019.
â  The former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, Olivier Blanchard, argued in a speech that for countries like the United States, high public debt isn't necessarily a problem. To people who follow the I.M.F., it was as if a former pope came out with an endorsement of the devil.
â  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the charismatic new congresswoman who has shown an uncanny ability to drive public policy debates, indicated openness to "modern monetary theory," the idea that public spending need not be constrained by tax revenues.
â  President Trump delivered an 82-minute-long State of the Union speech in which he did not use the words "debt" or "budget deficit."
Economic orthodoxy that ruled for decades held that fiscal responsibility was inherently good and the national debt a leviathan to fear. Now the intellectual and political currents are flowing -- gushing, really -- in the opposite direction.
After President Trump's election, Republicans decided to pursue their agenda of tax cuts and higher military spending without doing the unpopular work of paying for it.
Democrats are coming to believe they have hamstrung themselves in pursuit of their goals by worrying about so-called pay-fors, policies that offset the cost. When they next take power, they may feel empowered to take on a much more ambitious, expensive agenda.
And macroeconomists are confronting the reality that the sky did not fall, even as the United States swung from a $ 236 billion surplus in the 2000 fiscal year to a $ 779 billion deficit in 2018. By their old theories, high deficits and debt should have caused interest rates and inflation to rise, and government borrowing should have "crowded out" capital from the private sector.
At a minimum, the old rules simply seem not to apply in a world that has free-flowing capital; an aging population; and stubbornly low inflation and interest rates. Or, more controversially, maybe those rules were never really an accurate description of how economics works in a country like the United States that can borrow in its own currency.
How did everyone -- liberals and conservatives, politicians and economists -- get so comfortable with debt?
The Clinton surpluses to Bush deficits
The start of the 21st century was a triumphalist moment for the United States economy. The unemployment rate was at its lowest in decades, workers' wages were rising, inflation was well contained and the stock market had reached staggering highs.
The bipartisan conventional wisdom was that fiscal conservatism was a meaningful part of why: In the early 1990s, tax increases signed by George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton, combined with spending restraint, lowered projected deficits. That, in turn, generated lower interest rates. Global bond markets and the Federal Reserve rewarded fiscal restraint.
Lower interest rates, in this telling, fueled an investment boom generating higher productivity -- and all the good things about the turn-of-the-century economy.
To those in charge, this story of cause-and-effect seemed almost self-evident. But even then, there were reasons to question it.
For one thing, the cause-and-effect might have been backward. Maybe the economic boom caused the surpluses, not the other way around. And continuing fiscal surpluses meant a falling supply of Treasury bonds, the bedrock of the global financial system. Could that have been destabilizing?
Some economists thought so, for example, Stephanie Kelton, who as a young scholar studied under the groundbreaking Cambridge economist Wynne Godley. In their thinking, the American combination of government budget surpluses and current account deficits -- meaning importing more than exporting -- would cause private debt to rise. And private debt, they said, is more dangerous than the public kind; private borrowers cannot create money from thin air.
In 2001, the boom turned to recession. The Bush administration sought lower income tax rates, especially for investment income, and passed them in 2001 and 2003. In 2003, Congress and the administration created an expensive new Medicare prescription drug benefit. The country faced the new costs of wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. The surpluses vanished.
Interest rates and inflation remained low throughout the Bush years even as deficits soared, and rather than being crowded out by government borrowing, capital was freely available to private borrowers -- so much so that it fueled a housing bubble.
Then came the global financial crisis.
The steep contraction in the economy in 2008 and the first half of 2009 caused tax revenues to plummet and social safety net spending to soar. The Obama administration advanced a deficit-financed $ 787 billion package of spending and tax cuts to contain the economic damage.
But strikingly, even amid soaring deficits, President Obama embraced the language of the old Clinton-era consensus. "It has never been more important to ensure that as our economy recovers, we do what it takes to bring this deficit down," he said in his first address to Congress in early 2009.
When Republicans won control of the House of Representatives in 2010, in part by assailing the enormous Obama deficits, there was a bipartisan view that the United States was at risk of a fiscal crisis. The concern was that high debt would cause international investors to lose confidence in Treasury bonds and dump them, sending interest rates soaring and cratering the economy.
The deficit did come down in the late Obama years, in part after Republicans insisted on budget cuts in so-called sequestration policies and the Obama administration insisted on allowing some of the Bush tax cuts to expire, raising taxes.
When President Trump took office, Republicans in Congress initially discussed lowering corporate tax rates while keeping the government's revenue stable with a "destination-based cash flow tax."
But the problem with a deficit-neutral tax change is that the losers, especially retailers in this case, tend to be more vocal than the winners. Congressional Republicans agreed on the deficit-widening parts of tax reform, cutting the corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent, reducing taxes on many "pass-through" businesses, and more. They couldn't agree on offsetting moves to raise revenue.
In October 2017, the Senate passed rules allowing a tax bill that raised the deficit by $ 1.5 trillion over 10 years. And just weeks after passing tax cuts, large bipartisan majorities in Congress voted on spending bills that increased federal outlays by about 13 percent.
"It just didn't seem like there was any way to get to deficit neutral or revenue neutral," said former Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, who ultimately voted for the tax cuts after voicing deficit concerns along the way. "Do I wish it was revenue neutral? Yes. Do I wish we had not turned around and voted for $ 2 trillion in spending that was unpaid for? Absolutely."
Mr. Corker says tax cuts are fulfilling their goal of making American businesses more competitive, though he said he still worried about Congress's retreat from fiscal probity.
"I was there for 12 years, and I think for eight or nine years of that time I felt Congress would deal with fiscal issues -- I see no hope of that currently," he said.
Yet again, though, there has been scant evidence that this is doing the kind of damage to the economy that the old models predicted. The United States government can borrow money for 30 years for a smidgen over 3 percent. It was 6.5 percent back when surpluses reigned.
Letting borrowers be borrowers
Larry Summers was the last Treasury secretary to oversee a full year of fiscal surplus, in the final days of the Clinton administration. Last month, he and the economist Jason Furman published an article titled "Who's Afraid of Budget Deficits: How Washington Should End Its Debt Obsession."
Focusing on limiting public debt, they argued, had hamstrung the nation's ability to invest in things with long-term benefits, namely education, health care and infrastructure.
"The basic idea that if you issue too much debt you will crowd out large amounts of valuable private capital investment was a reasonable view in the early to mid-1990s," Mr. Summers, a Harvard economist, said in an interview. With very low interest rates worldwide, it isn't today, he said.
Mr. Summers and other non-alarmist economists are not suggesting that debt never matters.
They say that in this environment -- with low interest rates to the horizon, no evident inflation pressures, and with worthwhile policies that could enhance the nation's long-term outlook -- it's foolish not to borrow money.
Mr. Blanchard, the former I.M.F. chief economist, emphasizes that interest rates are comfortably below the rate at which the economy is growing. That means that, despite high debt levels in the United States, it shouldn't matter if the nation keeps borrowing money because its capacity to pay is growing faster than interest costs.
Some take the argument even further.
Ms. Kelton, who went from her early research on debt to advise Senator Bernie Sanders and other politicians on the left, argues that a currency-issuing government needn't worry that deficits will lead to a fiscal crisis. Rather, inflation becomes a risk if spending outpaces the finite supply of workers and productive capacity.
The political implication of modern monetary theory is that you should lay out what you believe is an important priority for the country, and if you have the votes, enact it. Ms. Kelton said Presidents Trump and George W. Bush behaved as if they were M.M.T. adherents, and as a result had greater flexibility to enact their agenda than a more fiscally conservative president would.
Even the members of Congress on the left aren't ready to disregard fiscal constraints entirely. But they are focusing on the upside of their policies.
When Senator Elizabeth Warren was asked if she believed in the modern monetary theory approach, she told Bloomberg Television: "It's only when we talk about the things that go to hard-working Americans that Republicans seem to get religion about the national debt. Debt matters. There comes a point where debt matters. But what I care about is that we need to rethink our system in a way that is genuinely about investments that pay off over time."
Moreover, Ms. Warren has proposed a wealth tax on assets over $ 50 million. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez has supported a 70 percent tax rate on income over $ 10 million. Moves like those would reduce the deficit impact of their spending proposals. But both speak of those strategies as desirable on their own terms, for fairness, rather than as necessary sacrifices to pay for aggressive climate change action or cheaper college access.
It's as if Democrats and Republicans were divorced parents who share custody -- and elected Democrats feel that the Republicans are the parent constantly giving the children pizza and sweets, while the Democrats worry about healthy eating.
"There's a sense of 'Why do we always have to be the fiscal grown-ups?' " said Jared Bernstein, who worked in the Obama administration and is now a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. "It puts your party at a disadvantage if we're the ones saying you have to eat your spinach all the time."
The hawks' warning
Republicans may cut taxes with abandon, and Democrats seem increasingly ready to undertake their agenda with similar disregard to fiscal consequences. But there remains a politically homeless group: people who see profound risks in the bipartisan willingness to embrace deficit spending.
In 2011, Erskine Bowles, who was co-chairman of a committee aimed at long-term deficit reduction, predicted that a fiscal crisis could arrive in two years.
That didn't happen. But Mr. Bowles believes that in the generation to come, there will be regrets over the current era of large deficits even in a time of economic strength: "I'm confident many Americans will wonder why didn't those old guys make some of these tough decisions 20 to 30 years ago."

Full text: MOSCOW -- President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia -- facing an economically beleaguered, less-supportive public -- used his annual state-of-the-nation speech on Wednesday to promise a raft of social spending, while also doubling down on threats against the United States.
Mr. Putin said Washington was fueling a new arms race by withdrawing from a landmark nuclear weapons treaty and possibly deploying new missiles in Europe. Without mentioning any country in particular, he warned that if American missiles were deployed on the continent, within a few minutes' flight of his country, Russia would aim its weapons at those missiles and at targets in the United States.
"Russia will be forced to create and deploy new types of weapons that could be used not only against the territories where a direct threat to us comes from, but also against the territories where decision-making centers directing the use of missile systems threatening us are located," he said. "The capability of such weapons, including the time to reach those centers, will be equivalent to the threats against Russia."
Russian missiles, including nuclear weapons, targeting the United States is not new. Nor is saber rattling by Mr. Putin, who devoted much of his speech last year to what he claimed were highly advanced new weapons.
But on Wednesday, amid a steady deterioration in relations with Washington, he made some of his most explicit threats ever. They followed the announcement this month that President Trump was withdrawing the United States from the landmark 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, after years of accusations -- rejected by Moscow -- that Russia had violated the pact.
Russia will develop and deploy whatever weapons systems are needed to remain secure, Mr. Putin said, though, as he is well aware, a costly arms race in the 1980s, combined with sinking oil prices, contributed to the collapse of the Soviet Union. His aggressive tone appeared to be intended, in part, to convinced Washington not to abandon the treaty.
"Among the ruling class" in the United States, he said, are many people who "are too captivated by ideas of their exceptionalism and their superiority over the entire rest of the world."
"But do they know how to count?" he asked. "Surely they do. Let them first calculate the range and speed of our advanced weapons systems, and then make decisions on the threats against our country."
Mr. Putin did not criticize President Trump, instead suggesting, as he has in the past, that a secretive "deep state" hobbled the American president.
In his speech last year Mr. Putin cataloged an array of new weapons that he said Russia was developing, while animations showed missiles striking the United States. This year he mentioned just a few.
This spring, he said, Russia will launch its first nuclear submarine carrying a Poseidon, an unmanned underwater nuclear drone, and will deploy a new Zircon hypersonic missile for the Russian Navy. The missile can fly at nine times the speed of sound with a range of 620 miles, he said.
Mr. Putin took up his usual foreign policy cudgel at the end, using most of the 90-minute speech to Russian lawmakers to focus on improving the standard of living in Russia.
In promising both butter and missiles, however, Mr. Putin did not explain how the troubled Russian economy could pay for it all. As always with his addresses focused on domestic issues, there was a certain gap between the Russia he was describing and the reality.
Mr. Putin promised all kinds of additional public benefits, noting that having 19 million Russians still living in poverty in a nation of some 145 million people was too high. Much of the new social spending was pitched toward families with young children, addressing a population decline that Mr. Putin has tried previously to reverse.
The president promised salary and pension increases for tens of millions of Russians above the inflation rate. He mentioned more and better local medical clinics, improved cancer treatment, more modern garbage collection methods, greater environmental protection, more support for cultural activities both in cities and rural areas, less bureaucratic intervention in economic activity and much, much more.
Maksim S. Oreshkin, the economy minister, defended the president, saying the fact that he had quoted so many precise spending numbers meant that the budget calculations had already been made.
The government recently revealed plans to spend some of its gold reserves on infrastructure projects. But it has also raised retirement ages, and various taxes and fees -- deeply unpopular measures that amounted to a tacit admission that its spending was unsustainable.
And even as Mr. Putin extolled the benefits of diversifying the Russian economy away from its dependence on commodities like oil and gas, Michael Calvey, the American founder of one of the largest Russian venture capital firms investing in new technology sat in jail, recently arrested on seemingly spurious fraud charges because of a commercial dispute over a bank.
In promising higher wages, Mr. Putin seemed to be trying to steal some thunder from Aleksei A. Navalny, the main opposition leader. Mr. Navalny announced last month the formation of a national trade union to fight for better wages for doctors, teachers and other professionals, a promise Mr. Putin had made previously.
Amid Mr. Putin's lengthy list of promises, there were occasional asides that underscored his desire that Russia be a nation apart. Mr. Putin called on the government to create a new national brand of green consumer products.
Ignoring the lack of environmental controls in Russia, where snow blackened by soot recently fell on a Siberian coal mining center, he said, "these products will be extremely popular on international markets because there is nothing clean left abroad."
The president expressed annoyance that he had had to intervene personally in the garbage issue to resolve situations where public demonstrations have erupted to protest overflowing landfills. Garbage protests have only spread in the past month.
Over all, Mr. Putin's approval rating has dropped sharply in the last year, initially prompted by raising the retirement age but also fueled by five years of dropping real incomes, higher prices and a variety of new taxes. Mr. Putin seemed to be trying to address all those grievances with his laundry list of promises.
As he said at the very start of the speech, "People should see an improvement in their lives starting this year."

Full text: Federal Reserve officials decided in late January to pause their steady campaign to raise interest rates as the global economic outlook became less certain and financial markets failed to appreciate the Fed's willingness to shift if the economy weakened, according to the minutes of that meeting released on Wednesday.
Fed officials concluded that a pause posed "few risks" for a strong economy in which prices continued to increase at a subdued rate, the minutes show. The Fed did not see any immediate threats to America's economic expansion, but officials indicated they were worried enough about potential risks -- including slowing growth in China and Europe, trade tensions, a volatile stock market and a prolonged government shutdown -- to postpone rate increases.
Whether the Fed will raise rates at all in 2019 remains unclear. The minutes show a divergence among Fed officials, with "several" saying they believed it would be appropriate to raise rates again later this year "if the economy evolved as they expected." Others were less eager to resume the increases, particularly if inflation remained below the Fed's 2 percent target.
James Bullard, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, suggested to reporters this month that the Fed had gone too far with rate increases last year. Other officials have said in recent days they expect rate increases to resume, a view the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland president, Loretta J. Mester, expressed in a speech this week.
Markets found little new information in the minutes. The S&P 500, which had been negative earlier in the day, rose slightly. Treasury bond yields barely budged.
The January meeting was a departure by the Fed from what had been a slow and steady march toward higher rates and less stimulative monetary policy amid a strengthening economy. After five consecutive quarters of raising rates, Fed officials left them unchanged in January, as expected. But they surprised markets in the policy statement released after the meeting, which dropped previous language that said "some further gradual increases" in interest rates would be warranted in the months to come.
That shift appears to have been, in part, a corrective note to financial markets, which officials believed had turned volatile in December on the belief that Fed officials were not sufficiently worried about economic uncertainty at home and abroad -- or willing to adopt more stimulative policy measures if those uncertainties turned into economic drags.
The Fed's communication after its December meeting, when officials raised rates by a quarter of a percentage point, "were reportedly perceived by market participants as not fully appreciating the tightening of financial conditions and the associated downside risks to the U.S. economic outlook that had emerged since the fall," the minutes said.
Officials worried in particular that investors did not have a clear picture of how the Fed planned to deal with the slimming of the bond portfolio it amassed in the wake of the financial crisis. In addition to lowering interest rates to near zero, the Fed tried to goose the economy by purchasing large quantities of mortgage bonds and Treasury securities, as a way to encourage investors to buy riskier assets, like stocks.
The Fed has slowly been winnowing that $4 trillion portfolio by allowing up to $50 billion in bonds to mature each month, but officials appeared to agree in January that the balance sheet runoff should end this year.
Officials agreed that "it would be desirable to announce before too long a plan to stop reducing the Federal Reserve's asset holdings later this year" and said the announcement "would provide more certainty about the process for completing the normalization of the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet."
The minutes also highlighted just how hard it is for the Fed, which does not traffic in plain language, to always effectively communicate its plans. At the January meeting, Fed officials noted that investors were perceiving the central bank to be "insufficiently flexible" in both its rate increase campaign and its balance sheet runoff.
Fed officials tried to change those perceptions after both the December and January meetings. The Fed chairman, Jerome H. Powell, said in a news conference on Jan. 30 that officials had concluded that recent economic developments -- including slowing global growth, turmoil in financial markets and uncertainty over trade negotiations -- had pushed the central bank to "a patient, wait-and-see approach regarding future policy changes."
"We are now facing a somewhat contradictory picture of generally strong U.S. macroeconomic performance, alongside growing evidence of crosscurrents," Mr. Powell said. "At such times, common sense risk management suggests patiently awaiting greater clarity."
Curt Long, the chief economist at the National Association of Federally-Insured Credit Unions, said the minutes revealing the shift to a more "patient" stance were "certainly a nod to jittery markets."
Greg McBride, the chief financial analyst for Bankrate.com, was more blunt: "It's evident the Fed was rattled by the markets and caved," he wrote on Wednesday.
The minutes show Fed officials saw little downside to the shift. They show officials "pointed to a variety of considerations that supported a patient approach to monetary policy," including the need for additional economic data, which would help policymakers better gauge business and consumer sentiment.
The Fed also believed that being patient would allow more time to determine the effect of President Trump's trade war with China and other countries and the economic damage from the prolonged government shutdown, which had not been resolved at the time of the January meeting.
"Information arriving in coming months could also shed light on the effects of the recent partial federal government shutdown on the U.S. economy and on the results of the budget negotiations occurring in the wake of the shutdown, including the possible implications for the path of fiscal policy," the minutes said.
The pause had its desired effect with investors, as markets celebrated that news with a rally that has since continued.
Other critics of the Fed's interest rate campaign also appear to have been pleased. Mr. Trump -- who has repeatedly criticized the Fed for raising interest rates -- dined with Mr. Powell soon after the meeting. Many liberal economists also cheered the move to slow rate increases, saying it would help workers by continuing to buoy the labor market and potentially raise wages.

Why a Downturn This Time May Not Be Housing's Fault

Full text: The United States has had 11 recessions since the end of World War II. All but two were preceded by a big decline in the housing market.
Inside that bit of trivia lie some fundamental insights into housing's outsize role in the business cycle, along with clues to suggest that the economy is on firmer footing than the increasingly pessimistic forecasts make it seem. The gist is this: The United States may or may not enter a recession this year, but if it does, housing is unlikely to be the cause, because it never really recovered in the first place.
"Housing is not in a position to lead this thing down," said Edward Leamer, an economics professor at the University of California, Los Angeles.
How much it can help prolong the overall recovery is another matter. Home sales and prices have been sluggish in the face of rising interest rates. Still, the pace of construction, combined with pent-up demand from young adults, suggests that the sector should at least remain stable in the face of uncertainty elsewhere.
Why is housing so often a focus of anxiety as economic expansions run their course? Here are a few reasons.
Housing is more volatile than bigger sectors
Even though housing does not account for all that much of the economy, its role in recessions is huge, because it is highly cyclical and sensitive to interest rates. Think of expansions and recessions as the cycle of things that go up and down a lot. Housing is a big determinant of where that cycle is headed because, unlike many other sectors, it has wide swings.
The housing sector accounts for as little as 3 percent of economic output during recessions and about twice that during booms. Other pieces of the economy are much bigger, but they don't change nearly as much from boom to bust. Government spending, for instance, has hovered between 17 percent and 20 percent of the economy for decades. The three-percentage-point swing is about the same in each case, but government accounts for much more of the economy. Translation: Housing punches way above its weight.
As a result, while housing has never accounted for more than 7 percent of total output, it has on average accounted for about a quarter of the weakness in recessions since World War II, according to a 2007 paper by Mr. Leamer titled "Housing IS the Business Cycle."
After housing, the sector that has historically been second most important to recessions is consumer durables, or expensive purchases like cars, furniture and appliances. Those are often connected to the housing market's prosperity because people usually buy other things when they purchase a home.
Sometimes downturns have other causes, but they only underscore housing's role in economic cycles. The 1953 recession followed a decline in government spending after the Korean War, and the 2001 recession was driven by a decline in business spending after the dot-com bubble popped. Both were relatively brief and shallow -- the 2001 recession was the least severe since World War II -- in part because housing investment remained stable.
The most recent recession, from 2007 to 2009, offered one of the more exaggerated examples of housing's guiding role in downturns. A recent report from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis found that the construction sector accounted for a little over a third of the decline in output in the past recession, and about half of the job losses (a figure that includes laid-off construction workers and job losses in connected industries).
How does housing look now? Mixed, but mixed in such a way that the things most important to economic growth are the most stable.
Prices have been discouraging buyers
Measured in sales and prices, the housing sector appears to be in a precarious position. Existing-home sales were down about 10 percent in December from a year earlier, according to the National Association of Realtors. The group blamed rising prices and interest rates, and a lack of supply that has left buyers underwhelmed by their choices.
Much of the problem is that while job growth has been strong, home prices have gone up faster than incomes.
Prices have gone up so far so fast that even markets previously considered affordable are beyond the reach of many buyers. Home prices have risen by about 50 percent since 2012, according to Zillow, and many of the more affordable markets have shot up even faster. In Phoenix, home values have doubled since 2012, not adjusted for inflation. The Denver market is up 90 percent, Atlanta 84 percent, Nashville 78 percent and Dallas 76 percent. If people can't afford a home in Texas, where can they?
The sticker shock of rising prices, combined with rising interest rates that make monthly payments more expensive, scared off many buyers toward the end of last year. Some of that demand seemed to come back at the start of the year, after interest rates fell to roughly where they were a year ago.
Nevertheless, homes are sitting on the market longer, price cuts are becoming more common, and a number of homebuilders have had layoffs. Before a recent speech to 1,000 people from the housing industry, John Burns, founder of John Burns Real Estate Consulting, asked the members of the audience to forecast the year ahead. They were evenly split between those seeing sales and price declines and those seeing growth.
"Everybody is being really cautious right now," Mr. Burns said in an interview.
This all sounds very bad, but for anyone who isn't trying to sell a home or in the business of selling homes, it's not as bad as it seems.
Builders are less bullish than in the past
When economists talk about a recession in housing, they largely refer to construction, not home prices. Most of the industry's contribution to annual gross domestic product lies in residential fixed investment, a category composed almost entirely of the building of single-family homes and apartment and condominium buildings (along with a small amount of home improvements and renovations).
Rising home prices help the economy in small but important ways, like making people feel richer and building up home equity that owners can tap and spend elsewhere. But increased spending from people feeling richer is not nearly as important as the pace of home sales and the volume of construction, since both of those create many jobs -- for people like real estate agents and mortgage brokers on the sales side, and the architects, construction workers, electricians, plumbers and others who design and build new homes.
Home buying is weak and getting weaker, so that could be a concern. But construction is bordering on moribund. Total housing starts grew at an annual rate of 1.2 million a year in January, more than double the recession-era low of less than 500,000, but still well below an average of 1.5 million from 1990 to the start of the housing bust -- despite an expanding population.
Clearly the need for housing is there, so why aren't builders building more? That is a confounding question.
During conference calls to announce their earnings, publicly traded builders like D.R. Horton and PulteGroup have said much the same thing as real estate agents, which is that buyers are put off by higher prices and creeping interest rates. Many builders also cite local regulations that make it harder to build homes in denser areas closer to jobs, and higher labor costs in a tight job market.
The overall message is that builders cannot build homes at the prices people want in the places people want them, so they aren't building much at all.
The largest demand for housing is at the lower end of the market, the hardest to serve profitably, although in conference calls a number of builders said they were shifting some of their building and land buying toward cheaper, smaller homes. This may or may not improve the pace of building.
The result is that the housing sector -- the residential construction components of G.D.P., taken together -- accounted for only 3.9 percent of the economy in the third quarter, and has helped drag down overall economic output for three quarters.
In other words: Housing is in recession already. It might not get better soon, but it probably won't get worse.

Full text: Patrick Caddell, the political pollster who helped send an obscure peanut farmer named Jimmy Carter to the White House, later became disillusioned with fellow Democrats and finally veered right to advise supporters of Donald J. Trump, died on Saturday in Charleston, S.C. He was 68.
His death, from complications of a stroke, was confirmed by a colleague, Prof. Kendra Stewart of the College of Charleston.
While Mr. Caddell was considered instrumental in Mr. Carter's victory in 1976, he also shared the blame for limiting him to a single term. He helped persuade the president to deliver a speech that was intended to inspirit the nation during an energy crisis and economic slump, but instead tarred Mr. Carter as a weakling who was unable to lift the country out of its malaise.
Instead, in 1980 voters chose Ronald Reagan, a Republican who promised a rosier vision that he would describe during his successful re-election campaign as "morning again in America."
In fact, Mr. Carter never mentioned the word "malaise" in his 1979 address to a nation fed up with endless lines at gas stations, inflation and joblessness. And his solemn jeremiad bemoaning the "crisis of the American spirit" when "human identity is no longer defined by what one does, but by what one owns" was initially well received.
But it turned out that the crisis of confidence was in Mr. Carter's ability to get the country going again and to revive it from its malaise -- a description that Clark M. Clifford, a presidential adviser, had invoked before the speech.
By the late 1980s, Mr. Caddell had become disaffected with the Democratic Party, but his advice to candidates remained largely consistent, the same as it was for Jimmy Carter when, running as an outsider in 1976, he said "I'll never lie to you" and promised "a government as good as its people."
That message, whether it applied to Mr. Carter or to Donald Trump in 2016, was to appeal to the expanding pool of voters alienated from Washington.
Scott Miller, a colleague who developed the political research site WeNeedSmith.com, said that many people would not miss Mr. Caddell's "needling and nettling," but "the fact is, political calm made Pat very uneasy."
"That calm means that the cement of the status quo is hardening, that the inevitable corruption of power is taking deeper root, that incumbent complacency is turning overripe on the vine," Mr. Miller said in an email. "This drew him to the change leaders: to George McGovern, to Jimmy Carter, to Gary Hart, to Steve Jobs, to Ross Perot and eventually to Donald Trump."
In 2016, he became a frequent commentator on Fox News and advised Stephen K. Bannon, who became President Trump's chief White House strategist, and Robert Mercer, a computer mogul and contributor to the Trump campaign.
As early as 1987, William Schneider, a political analyst with the American Enterprise Institute, called Mr. Caddell "the living American with the most direct experience in presidential campaigns, except for one, Richard Nixon."
Patrick Hayward Caddell was born on May 19, 1950, in Rock Hill, S.C. His mother was Janie (Burns) Caddell. His father, Newton P. Caddell, was a Coast Guard chief warrant officer. Patrick grew up near various Coast Guard stations, spending most of his youth in Falmouth, Mass., and Jacksonville, Fla., where he attended parochial high school and also began taking his first public opinion surveys.
"Math was not my favorite subject," he said, but at 16, for a mathematics project in his junior year, he fashioned a "voter election model" of the Jacksonville area for predicting elections based on early returns.
"I set up at the courthouse and called all the elections early with great abandon, with no idea what I was doing," he said. "And they all turned out right."
That was the extent of his formal academic training in public opinion research.
He was still an undergraduate at Harvard, where he earned a bachelor's degree in political science in 1972 and started a thesis on "the changing South," when he started polling professionally for Senator George S. McGovern's fledgling presidential primary operation.
McGovern lost to President Nixon in a landslide; Mr. Caddell's political acumen and polling expertise, translating data into tactical strategy, were among the few creditable outcomes of the campaign.
He established his own firm, Cambridge Survey Research, to conduct political campaigns. Although he spun off another company, Cambridge Reports, to advise corporate clients, he was criticized for capitalizing on his Washington connections -- representing, among other clients, nuclear energy companies and the Saudi Arabian government -- especially when, during the Carter administration, he became known as the president's pollster.
Campaign staffs are not known for sharing credit, but in June 1976, when Mr. Carter had secured the Democratic nomination, his campaign manager, Hamilton Jordan, confidently told a reporter: "You know why Jimmy Carter is going to be president? Because of Pat Caddell -- it's all because of Pat Caddell."
Mr. Jordan said that in helping Mr. Carter defeat Gov. George C. Wallace of Alabama in the Florida primary, Mr. Caddell had reaffirmed the campaign's overall strategy but had also pinpointed where to concentrate its resources.
Before Mr. Carter was inaugurated in January 1977, Mr. Caddell advised him to stick to broad themes and issued a warning: "Too many good people," he wrote in a 56-page memo, "have been beaten because they tried to substitute substance for style."
Mr. Caddell is survived by a daughter, Heidi Caddell Eichelberger; a brother, Daniel; a sister, Patricia Roberts; and three grandchildren.
As a Harvard government major, Mr. Caddell understood that democracy and politics could sometimes conflict. He was quoted in "The Permanent Campaign" by Sidney Blumenthal as saying that Reagan's tightly regulated contacts with the news media in his 1980 campaign set a model.
"I would never be involved in another presidential campaign where the candidate was openly accessible to the press," Mr. Caddell said. "As a campaign operative, this makes it easier for me. As an American citizen, I shudder to think what people like me would do. It's terrible for the country."

Full text: Hip-hop's interest in contemporary art is, by now, something of a clichÃ©. American materialism has been at the center of rap lyrics since at least 1982, when Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five rhymed about stolen TVs and "double-digit inflation." But long before Jay-Z was rapping about wanting "a Picasso in my casa," before Kanye West was putting a Takashi Murakami on an album cover, before Kendrick Lamar was restaging Gordon Parks photographs in a music video, before BeyoncÃ©, after having already paid homage to the Swiss video artist Pipilotti Rist in a promotional film for her album "Lemonade," filmed another video with Jay-Z, her husband, inside the Louvre, before Drake cited James Turrell as an influence on the visuals for one of his tours in the same interview in which he said Jay-Z makes too many art references in his lyrics and claimed "the whole rap/art world thing is getting kind of corny" -- there was the hip-hop producer Swizz Beatz, who had his first hit single in the late '90s while still a teenager, and who used the money to buy an Ansel Adams photograph.
Swizz Beatz, whose real name is Kasseem Dean, lives in a house in Englewood, N.J., that used to belong to Eddie Murphy. Its driveway is long enough that, after a taxi had dropped me at the front gate and I buzzed the intercom, an assistant had to come down in her car to pick me up. Just inside the foyer were a set of 1978 portraits of Muhammad Ali by Andy Warhol. In the living room were a couple of Gordon Parks photographs -- one of a Harlem gang leader, from 1948, the other of Ali training in London in 1966. (Dean has the largest collection of Parks photographs in private hands, and some of them will go on view in a show at Harvard this spring.) There was also a Grammy placed inconspicuously on a coffee table. Down a long, glassed-in hallway, I arrived at an enormous white room where hanging on one wall was a 2008 Kehinde Wiley painting, 25-feet long and 8-and-a-half-feet high, depicting a black man in a green hoodie reclining in a position reminiscent of Auguste ClÃ©singer's 1847 marble sculpture "Femme PiquÃ©e par un Serpent" (or "Woman Bitten by a Snake"), which gives the painting its name. In the back of the room was a 19-foot-tall wooden sculpture from 2013 by Kaws, a rendition of the artist's funereal Mickey Mouse figure, with X's for eyes and disfigured mouse ears. That the work fit indoors at all seemed to be some kind of logistical miracle. "There's no way I was going to put it outside," Dean tells me. "What if it snowed?" This room, he admits, started out as a "man cave," but once the Kaws sculpture arrived and the Wylie painting was hung, it turned into something more like a gallery. "They became like brothers," he says.
There is something about the home that doesn't quite fit with its owner's personality. It's not exactly showy, though I also can't bring myself to call an enormous sculpture of a deranged Mickey Mouse understated. And yet in person, Dean is soft-spoken and almost comically modest. He was wearing a cast when I visited him, a souvenir from the 40th birthday party that his wife, Alicia Keys, threw for him a few days earlier at the World on Wheels skating rink in Los Angeles. He tells me the story: BeyoncÃ© was pulling off some elegant moves on her skates, and so he attempted a spin and fell hard, breaking his arm in five places. But the party had just started -- all his friends had come out, and he knew his wife was going to unveil his present soon, and he didn't want to disappoint anyone, so he downplayed the pain. Cracks appeared in this facade when Jay-Z wrapped his arm around Dean for a picture and the wincing response the gesture received led Jay-Z to believe that his friend may have seriously injured himself. Finally, the group gathered outside, where Keys presented Dean with her gift to him -- a new Aston Martin -- which husband and wife promptly drove to the hospital.
Though he can be overwhelmingly humble, when I asked him how he thinks the hip-hop community became so interested in art, he responds, evenly and deliberately -- just stating the facts -- "I don't take credit for a lot of things, but I will take credit for that." DEAN was born in the Bronx in 1978 and was drawn to art from an early age because of the borough's thriving cultural scene in the 1980s, where he was fascinated by the graffiti art on subway cars and in apartment hallways. He began buying art for the same reason a lot of people do: status, an image to project to the world. This worked better with some people than others. "I got laughed at for collecting" at first by some friends, he tells me, who couldn't believe he was spending all his money on paintings, but it impressed the record executive Clive Davis, a collector himself, who went to Dean's house and saw that he was different from other musicians and producers with whom he did business. What began as a tool to use in renegotiating his music industry contracts soon turned into a compulsion, then a passion and, by the time he married Keys in 2010, a lifestyle. Over the past 20 years, he and his wife have built one of the great American collections of contemporary art, and he has quietly become one of the art world's most important power brokers, a singular advocate for artists in an industry that often exploits creativity for the sake of the bottom line.
As he began collecting more seriously, he and Keys refocused their purchases on living artists, especially African-American artists -- people like Nina Chanel Abney, Arthur Jafa and Deana Lawson -- who are the primary focus of what he now calls the Dean Collection, and whose careers he learned he could help as a high-profile client of various galleries. One of his tactics, he tells me, is walking into a gallery to ask questions about one of their younger artists -- often an artist of color -- who maybe hasn't had a show in a while, and if the gallery seems unenthusiastic and tries to sell him work by a different artist, he keeps pushing for the original artist he came to see, who often winds up getting a solo show as a result of his inquiries because he's shown the artist has market value. This might seem like a small gesture -- a collector advocating for an undervalued artist -- but commercial galleries are, above all, the front line in an industry obsessed with profit, and the importance of this kind of influence, which puts the artist above the business, from a collector (often the greediest of all players in this comedy of manners) can't be overstated. His goal has been nothing less than to "change the climate" of the art world, to shift the color of the artists on the walls of galleries and museums, which for most of history have been reserved for white men. "Because who else is going to do it?" he says. "Everybody goes into a gallery and sees what they can get for cheap and how to take advantage of an artist. I choose to do it the other way."
In the last few years, more and more artists of color have started to receive major exhibitions, with increasing regularity. This has been a positive development, but Dean also noticed an alarming trend of stories in the press speculating on black artists as the newest stars of the art market -- or, read another way, as a kind of shallow currency that can reinforce the art market's overarching greed: "I kept seeing write-ups saying this is what to buy, this is what you should do and all these business publications saying this is what you need to invest your money in, whether you like it or not." Visiting a 2015 retrospective of Kehinde Wiley at the Brooklyn Museum, where Dean is a member of the board, he looked at the names on the wall labels of who had lent works to the show and found no black collectors. And yet the media continued to anoint black artists as the future of the art world. "If they're saying we're the culture, how are we gonna be the culture if we don't own nothing from the culture?" he asks. After the show, he made a point of buying the largest Kehinde Wiley painting he could get his hands on, the one that now hangs in his house.
The relative absence of major works by black artists in black collections proved the importance of having the hip-hop community become serious connoisseurs of contemporary art, and for years now, Dean has acted as an informal adviser in this endeavor. One of the people he has helped over the years (and who has since become a major collector himself) is Sean "Diddy" Combs, the music mogul with whom Dean has a longstanding relationship. He recalled going one year with Combs to Art Basel Miami Beach, one of the world's biggest art fairs, where works are known to sell for seven figures within minutes of opening. A gallery was trying to sell Combs a substandard Picasso, "some lithograph," Dean says, in a tone of genuine disgust. "And I just said, 'You're not buying that Picasso. It's not happening.' " And Combs listened. "I told him, 'That's a bathroom piece, bro,' " by which he meant a less than desirable artwork you buy to hang over the toilet. "And the gallery was so mad at me," he continues. "But it's like, if you're gonna sell him a Picasso, sell him a [expletive] Picasso! Don't play around and misguide his purchase."
More recently, Dean helped facilitate Combs's purchase of Kerry James Marshall's 1997 painting "Past Times," which shows a black family having a picnic in a scene that recalls Seurat. Dean spoke to Jack Shainman, Marshall's dealer, about the history of the painting, and then took Combs to Sotheby's to view it. Combs ended up buying the work for $21.1 million, the most money ever paid for a living black artist. "I thought it was important that that particular piece went to an owner of color," Dean tells me. "It was time for us to step up to the plate and let the world know that we do own a piece of this market as well." To understand Dean's true impact on the contemporary art world, one must first grasp just how unethical and ridiculous the art world can be. The best summation of this I've ever seen came from an email chain that was forwarded to me that was between a group of prominent artists, some of whose works regularly sell for seven figures. One of them was trying to sell a work he owned by another prominent artist in order to pay for an expensive surgery, but he didn't want it to go to a particular collector who was known for selling works at auction for massive profits. "The auction thing is grotesque," one of the artists remarked in the email. "But most people just think it's fabulous. The art world is sick ... Now it's been taken over by these Kool-Aid drinking greedy ugly immoral hedge-fund auction-house zombies and everybody is just so titillated as they follow the creeps off the cliff."
Auction houses are largely unregulated dens of inequity, where the identities of buyers -- many of whom are actual white-collar criminals -- is a closely guarded secret, the prices of works are marked up mostly for reasons of theatrics and artists receive no percentage of the sales, no matter that they created the works now making everyone in the room rich. (The law is different in the United Kingdom, where artists often receive a small cut of resales, but not in America, despite ongoing efforts among artists and various members of Congress; the California Resale Royalty Act, which ensured that in certain cases a seller had to pay artists 5 percent of the resale price, was effectively nullified last year, when a federal court ruled that the Copyright Act took precedence over the state law.) These auctions are in turn covered breathlessly by the press, which celebrates each record as some testament to the strength of our global artistic culture and not just an elaborate ceremony of people getting ripped off. Imagine a developer who buys shoddy houses at foreclosure sales, repaints them and flips them for multiple times as much money, frequently to foreign buyers who will never even see the properties they purchased, and you get some idea of how this business functions. The difference is that the profit margins at art auctions are much higher and exist for far more arbitrary reasons: Auction houses merely capitalize on trends in the market and in most cases aren't investing in rehabbing paintings in the way a developer might with a house in order to increase its value.
Dean, who has never sold a work in his collection (he's only traded), is likely the first collector to argue openly on behalf of resale royalties for artists. Part of this comes from his background in music: He's able to buy so much art -- about 70 pieces in the last year alone -- partly because he still gets royalty checks 20 years after producing DMX's "Ruff Ryders' Anthem." (His other major hits include BeyoncÃ©'s "Check on It" from 2005, Jay-Z's "On to the Next One" from 2009 and T.I.'s "Bring Em Out" from 2004.) Artists in every other industry continue to collect money on what they create if it sells, except for visual artists, who simply watch as collectors flip their works to increase their own wealth. Even if American law doesn't change -- and there's little hope that it will -- "I think the answer is: Doing good for the artists should be a lifestyle," Dean says. "It should be the thing to do. Not a charity. People feel like when they're doing things for artists, it's like a charity. The artists don't need no charity from you! The artists just need respect. You should do it just because."
At a Sotheby's auction last September, he gave a speech about the importance of giving artists royalties. This was enough to convince one collector, Joel Straus, who sold a Kerry James Marshall artwork (a study, in fact, for the painting purchased by Combs) for $1.8 million and agreed to give Marshall a percentage. This wouldn't have been news if it weren't for the fact that it was presumably the first time a living artist had received a cut from a Sotheby's sale at its American headquarters. Dean has proposed sidestepping the law entirely and instead introducing an option for collectors selling a work through an auction house or gallery to simply check a box -- yes or no (he's been referring to it unofficially as "the Dean Choice") -- to indicate whether they'd like to give a percentage of the sale to the artist. He suggests that 3 to 5 percent is a fair commission.
Shainman, Marshall's dealer, tells me this is an uphill battle. Auction houses aren't exactly known for doing things because they are morally right. (Neither are dealers, for that matter. Since the '90s, Shainman has been one of the only American dealers to encourage collectors to resell works through his gallery instead of the auction houses, in part so that he can give the artist a percentage of his commission.) For Dean, though, ever the optimist, "we're just one sentence of disagreement off."
"If you're really a patron," he continues, "and really a collector, you're gonna say yes. And I feel that in the first year we introduce this option, 30 percent are gonna say yes. And then the year after that it will be 60 percent, and then it will just keep going up from there, and then we won't even need a rule. It will just be the thing to do. People are gonna want to check yes because the artists will know if they don't -- if they didn't do the right thing." If Dean's relationship to art is thoughtful, knowledgeable, careful and considerate, then his ideological opposite is Art Basel Miami Beach, which is held annually at the Miami Beach Convention Center and in satellite events across the city. I am not a spiritual person, but if the river Styx were so shallow that Charon had to drag by hand his boat carrying the departed souls into the underworld, one might have an idea of what it is like to walk up and down the length of Collins Avenue during these few December days. A mix of unapologetic corporate branding and a kind of neoliberal revenge fantasy in which no display of hollow wealth or drunken immaturity is too aggressive to be rendered off limits, this is an event during which I received emails informing me that, at a pop-up hosted by "Montauk hot spot the Surf Lodge," "Brandon Boyd of Incubus has installed his personal, free-form, ambiguous kind of visual style that focuses on magic, serendipity, curiosity and mystery." At the fair itself, I watched as a couple took a series of selfies in front of a Keith Haring painting, as if in flagrant disregard to the overwhelming sensation I was experiencing at the time that death is inescapable.
It was against this backdrop in Miami Beach that Dean had organized the seventh installment of the No Commission art fair, an event he began in 2015, in which 100 percent of the profits from the artworks sold goes to the artists who made them. (Typically at art fairs and in gallery exhibitions, artists get 50 percent from the sale of a work.) This alone was a remarkable feat of kindness, made all the more significant during a week that seemed to distill contemporary greed into some kind of primordial vision of the concept itself.
No Commission originated as Dean's class project in the Owner/President Management program at Harvard Business School, where he earned a degree in 2017. The idea was to make something that would not only benefit artists but also be accessible to novice collectors for whom art fairs, not to mention galleries, are often cold and unwelcoming places. (There was, however, still a brand sponsor, as there is for everything in Miami: BacardÃ­.)
Within the first minutes of opening, the shoe designer Christian Louboutin, hidden beneath a baseball cap, had bought three works. Dean posed for photos with some fans and then took a moment to admire a photograph by Jamel Shabazz, known for his street photography from the 1980s of people in Brooklyn and the Bronx, and the image of Dean looking at this picture seemed to demonstrate just how far he had traveled from the Bronx of his youth. He told me he was excited to see that, at the main fair, many galleries who are not known for working with artists of color had brought works to sell by black artists. The week had the same boozy self-indulgence, the same cheek-kissing emptiness of years' past, but it also felt like something was changing, hopefully for the better.
As he looked at the picture, I could see that there was writing on the back of his shirt. It said: "By the artist for the artist with the people." What's Swizz Beatz's favorite piece from his collection? Find out in our video on tmagazine.com.

Full text: There was a brief period this month when it seemed that the midterm elections, which delivered control of the House to Democrats, might immediately shake up Americans' income tax bills.
That sense of urgency lasted half a day.
On Feb. 7, newspapers reported that President Trump had said he was "open" to easing a tax law change that has been painful to many people in New York, New Jersey and California. That is the $10,000-per-household limit on federal deductions for state and local taxes, known as SALT, which was included in the 2017 tax overhaul.
"There are some people from New York who have been speaking to me about doing something about that, about changing things," Mr. Trump had told reporters from several regional newspapers. "I'd be open to talking about it."
Early that afternoon, however, Republicans closed the door on any such talks. "The Senate Finance Committee won't be revisiting the SALT deduction reforms made in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act," a spokesman for the committee chairman, Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, said in a news release.
Expect a lot more where that came from. Newly empowered Democrats have lots of ideas for changing tax policy, including repealing some or all of the tax law, which mostly took effect last year. But in a divided Washington, with Republicans controlling the Senate and the White House, it's unlikely that any of those changes will make their way into law.
For taxpayers trying to keep score at home, that portends a potentially dizzying year, one with much talk from Democrats and Republicans alike -- and little action. But that doesn't mean you can tune out the chatter entirely.
Today's tax debates could be tomorrow's policy changes, depending on how the next set of elections goes.
"While legislation is unlikely to advance, the robust Democratic primary field seems set on making tax policy a key tenet of their platforms," said Nicole Kaeding, director of federal projects at the Tax Foundation in Washington. "The debate is quickly moving away from the halls of the Capitol to the campaign trail."
A few things are certain
The new tax law has been contentious -- and fragile -- since Republicans raced it through Congress in less than two months. No Democrat in either chamber voted for the law, making it extremely vulnerable to extensive change, if not outright repeal, should Democrats gain complete control of the legislative and executive branches in Washington.
Adding to that vulnerability is the law's relatively low popularity. After a brief high shortly after enactment, the tax-cut measure has failed to attract the support of a majority of Americans in polling.
Many Democrats won House seats after promising to repeal all or part of the tax law -- particularly the SALT limit, which appears to have hurt Republican candidates in high-income, high-tax districts in areas like Orange County, Calif., and the New Jersey suburbs of New York City. But since the election, those promises have been overtaken by a flurry of legislative and campaign proposals to raise taxes on the rich.
Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York has proposed raising the top marginal income tax rate to 70 percent for people with incomes above $10 million. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a presidential candidate, recently unveiled a plan to levy a 2 percent annual wealth tax on Americans with a net worth exceeding $50 million. And Senator Kamala Harris of California, who is also running for president, says her top policy priority is a tax cut for low- and middle-income Americans that could cost nearly $3 trillion over a decade.
You don't need to spend a minute wondering if those plans might pass Congress this year: They won't.
Only a few tax changes are even remotely likely to affect you this year. Congress could decide to extend some expired tax credits retroactively, such as deductions for private mortgage insurance and higher-education expenses, Ms. Kaeding said. Such a move would simply continue tax credits that some taxpayers had come to depend on, which otherwise would vanish for the 2018 tax year and beyond.
There's a small chance that Democrats and Republicans might work together to slightly tweak tax advantages for retirement savings, but analysts see that as a long shot, at best.
The Trump administration is also considering pleas from some conservative groups to allow taxpayers to reduce their capital gains taxes by adjusting the initial value of an asset, such as a home or a share of stock, for inflation when it sells. The groups say that change would accelerate economic growth by freeing more money for investment. Previous administrations have concluded that such a move is outside the power of the executive branch, but many groups pushing for lower taxes have been meeting regularly with administration officials, urging them to make the change.
"This is a lot like a duck swimming in a pond," said Ryan Ellis, a tax lobbyist in Washington and a former tax policy director at Americans for Tax Reform, who is helping to lead the push for the capital gains change. "All the real action is happening underneath the surface."
If the administration took that step, however, it would inflame Democrats' critique of Republican tax policies, because adjusting capital gains for inflation would mainly benefit the wealthiest Americans. Economists from the Penn Wharton Budget Model project that the move would amount to an $88 billion tax cut over a decade for the top 1 percent of income earners in the United States -- and a $14 billion cut for the other 99 percent.
Taxes and the 2020 race
Soak-the-rich talk seems likely to escalate as Democratic candidates jockey for advantage in the 2020 presidential primaries. Increased taxation of high-income, high-wealth people can be a means of funding new social spending programs like universal prekindergarten education. It can also be a direct way of reducing inequality and wealth in the United States.
At the very least, in the months ahead, you're likely to hear a lot about millionaires and billionaires paying their "fair share." And you will probably hear about reducing taxes on middle-class workers -- who, thanks in part to the Trump tax cuts, pay a lower marginal tax rate than they have in 30 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
The campaign language may suggest what you can expect if Democrats win in 2020: If you're a millionaire or a billionaire, expect efforts to tax you more. If your income is lower, you might be in line for a break from the feds.
"Taxes on the rich are going to go up, and they will likely go up a lot," said Michael Linden, a fellow at the liberal Roosevelt Institute who has been a fervent opponent of Mr. Trump's tax policies. "The fundamental, underlying dynamic is that with near-record inequality, an aging population and an overall economic system that favors the haves over the have-nots, it's just untenable to have an overall tax code with as little progressivity as ours has, and generates as little revenue as ours does."
On the other hand, if Mr. Trump wins and Republicans sweep Congress again, you can expect a different vision to prevail -- one that embraces the new tax law. Its provisions for individuals are generally set to expire at the end of 2025, but with a strong Republican mandate, those cuts are likely to be made permanent.
For six-figure earners in high-tax states, well, things could get complicated, whoever wins the next election.
Democrats will almost certainly rail against the SALT cap on the campaign trail. Repealing the cap would provide relief for people who are finding that their taxes have gone up because of it. But it would also amount to a tax cut for the rich and, as Mr. Grassley's spokesman noted this month, that seems at odds with the economic goals of many Democrats.
In all of the passion of the political campaigns, it's worth listening carefully for clues on how that tension might be resolved.

Full text: GWAGWALADA, Nigeria -- The seven sewing machines were quiet at Diamonds Empire on a recent morning. The blades of a standing fan were still. Adama Daniel sat behind the front desk of the dark, stuffy tailor shop and moped.
The blackout in the neighborhood not far from the capital had started nearly 28 hours earlier. Customers were waiting on suits, dresses and a tiger-print miniskirt. Mr. Daniel was contemplating firing up his generator, but that would cut into his profit margins.
In 2015 when he cast a ballot for president, Mr. Daniel, who is 29, thought he would be in a better place by now. He had bounded into a polling station to throw his support behind Muhammadu Buhari, who seemed bursting with ideas to grow the country's lackluster economy. Mr. Daniel was elated when his candidate won. Finally, he thought, the country was on the right path.
Now, with a presidential election set for Saturday, any economic gains of the past four years are far from evident in Mr. Daniel's daily life. This weekend when he walks into the voting booth, Mr. Daniel is going to cast his ballot for Mr. Buhari's main opponent, Atiku Abubakar.
"He had four years and couldn't do anything," said Mr. Daniel, speaking of the president. "Another four years won't make a difference."
Although Mr. Buhari did make notable moves toward improving the economy during his term, the impact has not registered widely. His crowning achievement: pulling the oil-dependent nation out of a grueling recession.
He also chipped away at inflation. He banned imports of rice and other food to help local farmers. He moved more than five million people onto the tax rolls. Earlier this week, officials announced the last quarter of 2018 was Nigeria's strongest quarter of growth since the recession ended in 2017.
In a speech on Thursday night, he said Nigerians were seeing his economic efforts "bearing fruit."
But outside the wealthy elite, all that means little to countless Nigerians. Mr. Daniel, for one, spends $200 a month to buy diesel fuel for his generator to keep his business going. He's anxious to finish his medical degree but administrators at his school, and all public universities, keep striking for months at a time to agitate for better resources. His brother has an engineering degree but can't find a job that pays more than the tailors earn at Mr. Daniel's shop.
Mr. Abubakar, who has put economic issues at the center of his campaign, "knows what Nigerians need," said Mr. Daniel.
Nigeria is bracing for what could be a tight election this weekend. Threats of violence loom.
In the northeast of the country on Tuesday, a convoy heading to an election event and carrying Kashim Shettima, a state governor, was attacked by Boko Haram, an extremist Islamist group which operates in the region. At least three people were killed, officials said. Many of the governor's entourage fled into the bush after militants dressed as soldiers and riding in stolen military vehicles attacked, local news media reported.
The incident drew attention to another of Mr. Buhari's 2015 pledges: to destroy Boko Haram. Far from being crushed, Boko Haram has recently been gaining strength.
In the south, militants in the oil-rich Delta threatened to disrupt the economy, presumably by blowing up pipelines, if Mr. Buhari were re-elected. At a rally for the president in Rivers State this week, at least four people were killed in a stampede. Election officials reported fires in several sites where ballot materials were being stored.
Tensions have been so high that after the American ambassador to Nigeria called on both campaigns to carry out fair elections, Mr. Buhari's party called his statements "implicit attacks against the government."
Mr. Buhari and Mr. Abubakar, who each have pledged to accept the election results peacefully, wrapped up final appearances this week at rallies across the country, where thousands turned out wearing dresses, rings, hats and scarves plastered with their candidates' photos.
But across Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, life grinds on far from the rallies, the violence and the political maneuvering.
In Abuja, the capital, people cluster along the exhaust-choked highway all day, selling bags of bread from a nearby bakery at a markup. Metal drainage grates are missing from a major road, swiped by thieves hoping to sell them for scrap. Men playing after-work table tennis at a park complain about the price of rice and building materials.
More than half of Nigeria is living in poverty, according to the World Bank. The grim situation has forced everyone to think only of themselves, some civil leaders fear.
Hamzat Lawal, an anti-corruption activist who worked on a campaign to get more young people to run for office, said, "A lot of people are disconnected to the Nigerian dream where we're all united and connected."
Mr. Lawal supports neither of the two leading contenders. Mr. Abubakar, a former vice president, and Mr. Buhari, a former general who was in power under military rule in the 1980s, are establishment candidates who are both in their 70s. Fifty-one percent of the 84 million registered voters are between the ages of 18 and 35, according to government officials.
Last year Mr. Buhari called Nigerian youth "lazy," alienating many. On Thursday, his official Twitter account posted: "It is understandable that we all want to live comfortable lives. It is also important to realize that the most comfortable thing we can all do is to work hard and live within our means."
His health has also been an issue. He spent months abroad being treated for an illness he has yet to disclose. He was missing from public view for so long and rumors he was dead grew so loud that he publicly denied he was a clone of himself.
As an incumbent, Mr. Buhari carries a huge advantage. He has introduced poverty programs, including free school meals. Access to education in general has increased. He pledged recently to raise the minimum wage.
"He's trying," said Nana Lawan, who wore a dress with Mr. Buhari's face stamped on it at a rally this week.
Yet many graduates say they can't find jobs. Unemployment is rampant. Salaries are stretched for people who do have jobs. Some civil servants don't receive regular paychecks. The price of fuel has increased. People complain rent and public transit prices are too high.
"Do you see any customers in here?" huffed one shopkeeper in his tiny, empty store at Abuja's largest market, where dresses were stacked to the ceiling. "Atiku says he will make things better," he said, speaking of Mr. Abubakar.
Inside the market, frustration was rampant. Look around, Ruby Shaibu King said, pointing to the people braiding hair, painting toenails and selling spiked heels and cheap plastic bowls.
"Most everybody is a graduate," said Ms. King, who is in her third year of university, majoring in mass communications.
Jude Ben has a degree in business administration. He styles hair, along with dozens of others at the market. He's so frustrated that he's not voting.
"I'm 25-years-old and they told me Nigeria is going to get better," he said. "It's not getting better. When will it be better? When I'm in my 40s or 50s?"

The Debt Is Rising. Concerns Are Not.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The federal debt ticked past $22 trillion this week, a record that comes despite continued economic growth, but neither political party appears to be making a priority of debt reduction.
Larry Kudlow, the director of President Trump's National Economic Council, said on Thursday that the president was "concerned" about the rise of the debt, and that the administration would propose some reductions in federal spending in its next budget.
But he said the scale of the debt was not "a problem."
During the first two years of the Trump administration, the debt increased by more than $2 trillion, in part because of the $1.5 trillion tax cut and large spending increases the president has signed into law.
Leading Democrats also have left the issue largely untouched. Several members of the emerging field of presidential candidates have proposed tax increases, but they have generally presented those plans as antidotes for economic inequality, not measures aimed primarily at curbing the debt.
The absence of alarmist talk about federal borrowing represents a sharp shift. Republicans repeatedly criticized the growth of federal spending under President Obama as unaffordable and dangerous. Some Democrats criticized President George W. Bush's tax cuts for the same basic reasons.
But dire warnings about the consequences of federal borrowing have proved premature at best, and the political landscape has shifted. Republicans have embraced Mr. Trump's agenda of tax cuts and spending increases, arguing that it will lift economic growth. Democrats are seeking a very different set of changes in fiscal policy, but they too argue the federal debt is not an urgent problem.
"Politicians and policymakers should focus on urgent social problems, not deficits," two prominent liberal economists, Jason Furman and Lawrence H. Summers, wrote in a widely discussed piece published in the March/April issue of Foreign Affairs magazine. Both men were economic advisers to Mr. Obama.
Federal borrowing has expanded sharply. Most analysts prefer to measure the debt as a share of the nation's economic output, because a wealthier nation can afford to borrow larger sums. By that measure, the federal debt has climbed from 31 percent of gross domestic product in 2001 to 76 percent of gross domestic product at the end of the third quarter of 2018, the most recent available data.
(Those numbers are not based on the $22 trillion figure, which includes money the government borrowed from itself. Instead, analysts generally focus on the amount borrowed from others, about $16.2 trillion.)
Economists have warned that government borrowing would limit private sector borrowing, which would constrain economic growth; that it would drive up inflation; and even that the government might find itself unable to borrow, if creditors presumed the United States was too deep in debt and might be unable to make interest payments or repay its liabilities in full.
Some continue to ring those bells. Michael A. Peterson, the president of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, a leading advocacy group for debt reduction, noted the $22 trillion milestone with a statement that said the federal debt "threatens the economic future of every American."
The government's borrowing has real costs, notably the need to make interest payments to investors. Those payments now exceed $1 billion a day. But many experts have concluded that the gravity and immediacy of any threat to the broader economy was overstated. While federal borrowing puts upward pressure on interest rates, by increasing competition for available funds, larger forces have kept rates at low levels, including the eagerness of China and other nations to lend money to the United States.
Even as the debt climbed, interest payments as a share of G.D.P. declined.
Mr. Trump was among those who warned of dire consequences. In February 2015, he tweeted that if the debt topped $21 trillion, "Obama will have effectively bankrupted our country." And the next year, in March 2016, Mr. Trump told The Washington Post he could eliminate the federal debt within eight years.
Mr. Kudlow said Thursday that the White House still expected its policies to cause such an increase in economic growth that annual federal deficits would decline, slowing the rise of the debt.
"That's the key -- economic growth and some budget restraint," Mr. Kudlow said. "Growth, growth, growth, and limit spending. We are doing that, and we will do more of it."
Mr. Kudlow said the administration planned to propose a "very tough spending budget" this year, including cuts of at least 5 percent in nondefense discretionary spending.
That category, which includes spending on infrastructure, medical research and law enforcement, totaled about $610 billion last year, so a 5 percent cut would amount to roughly $30 billion -- a small fraction of the annual deficit, which is projected to approach $900 billion this fiscal year.
Also, discretionary spending already is low by historical standards -- and Mr. Trump has said that he would like to spend more money on infrastructure, medical research and law enforcement.
Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans also have proposed additional tax cuts.
There are some warning signs. Borrowing costs increased as the Federal Reserve began removing some of its post-crisis economic support, including raising interest rates. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, which reached a low of 1.375 percent in July 2016, has nearly doubled since then. On Thursday, the yield was 2.655 percent. The Congressional Budget Office projects interest payments will reach $383 billion this year and $460 billion in 2020.
The budget office also projects the debt will rise to 93 percent of economic output over the next decade, a level not seen since the 1950s.
And foreign investors, including foreign governments, are showing less appetite for lending money to the United States. The inflow of foreign funds is an important reason the federal government has been able to expand its borrowing without driving up interest rates or curtailing borrowing by the private sector. But the share of federal debt held by foreign investors has declined from 49 percent in 2008 to just 39 percent last year. Americans are instead providing a growing share of the money.
In January, a Treasury advisory committee made up of the Wall Street firms that help to sell federal debt warned that the trend could cause "a significant financing gap," and it urged the Treasury to consider a variety of new kinds of bonds -- which would make borrowing more expensive.
The rise of the debt also poses a more immediate problem. The total is expected to reach a statutory limit known as the "debt ceiling" later this year, requiring a congressional vote to raise the ceiling.

Full text: U.S. political discussion has been dominated by the issue of Donald Trump's wall -- an issue on which Trump's irrationality keeps surprising even his critics. So I don't imagine that many people have heard about Trump's nomination of David Malpass, currently an under secretary at the Treasury Department, to lead the World Bank. But it's a story worth following.
For one thing, while the U.S. traditionally gets to choose the World Bank's president (Europe gets the International Monetary Fund), there will be a lot of opposition to Malpass, who has a history of being hostile to international institutions. Furthermore, the Malpass nomination highlights the remarkable character of Trump's economic appointments.
Remarkable in what way? Well, remarkably bad. Every economist, yours truly very much included, gets it wrong sometimes. But Trump only seems to choose men who have been wrong about everything.
Beyond that, however, what's remarkable is the extent to which this president consistently chooses economists whose ideology is at odds with his own professed views on policy.
These days, at least, Trump is an easy-money guy who wants the Fed to keep interest rates low. But he keeps appointing deflationists -- men who opposed any attempt to rescue the economy from the financial crisis, who bitterly attacked the Fed for keeping rates low and demanded tight money even when we had very high unemployment.
Why does he do this? I'll get there in a minute. First, let's talk about who's on the Trump team.
At the top of the list is Larry Kudlow, director of the National Economic Council. He has quite a track record; as one commentator put it, he "has elevated flamboyant wrongness into a form of performance art."
Kudlow may be best known for his unflagging faith, in the teeth of the evidence, in the magic of tax cuts, as well as his dismissal of "bubbleheads" who predicted a housing crash. Less known is his 2008 praise for Bush officials for having the courage not to bail out Lehman Brothers. Just hours after his encomiums, Lehman's fall had plunged the whole world into financial meltdown.
Kevin Hassett, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, is another bubble denier, although his most famous prediction was in his 1999 book "Dow 36,000" (which, adjusted for inflation, would mean roughly Dow 55,000 today). More relevant to current policy, Hassett was among those who kept predicting, wrongly, that Ben Bernanke's efforts to fight unemployment would cause runaway inflation.
And then there's David Malpass, also both a bubble denier and a Bernanke-basher. Much press commentary has noted his 2007 insistence, as chief economist at Bear Stearns, that there was no reason to be worried about the financial system. A few months later his own firm imploded.
But I think his most revealing piece of commentary was a 2011 screed against low interest rates and what he considered a "weak dollar" policy. A low rate policy, he declared, hurts the economy because it "discourages thrift," while the weak dollar was bad for confidence, or something.
This was really bad economics. At the time, America had 9 percent unemployment, entirely because of inadequate private spending; to the extent that low interest rates were discouraging thrift and making people spend rather than save, that would have been a good thing, not a problem. And Malpass's argument about the dollar was just incoherent.
What's really striking, however, is that the policies Malpass attacked were precisely the policies Donald Trump now demands: low rates and a weaker dollar. So why would Trump want to promote him, and people like him?
Here's how I understand it: The first thing Trump looks for in an appointee is someone who shares his values -- above all, his absolute lack of compassion for those less fortunate than himself. And if you want an economic official who doesn't care about the poor or the unlucky, you must perforce go for a right-winger.
But Trump also has another criterion: He wants people who will be personally dependent on him, who don't have any kind of professional reputation to defend and therefore won't take a stand on principle. That is, he only wants hacks.
And here's the thing: Right-wing hack economists are, with hardly any exceptions, hard-money, hyperinflation-is-around-the-corner types. So Trump ends up with officials whose past views are diametrically opposed to what he says now.
Does this mean that the men he has chosen will stand in the way of his policies? No, not at all. They are hacks, after all, and will tell Trump whatever he wants to hear.
But it does mean that Trumpian economic policy is being made by men who, almost by definition, don't know what they're doing. To have gotten their jobs, they not only had to have track records of talking nonsense, but to have suddenly started talking completely different nonsense -- reversing their long-held positions to curry favor with the Very Stable Genius.
So what will happen if and when this economic team has to deal with real problems, like a global slump? Somehow, I'm not optimistic.

Full text: Much of Donald Trump's State of the Union address was devoted to describing the menaces he claims face America -- mainly the menace of scary brown people, but also the menace of socialism. And there has been a lot of discussion in the news media of what he said on those topics.
There has, however, been little coverage of one of the most revealing aspects of the SOTU: what Trump said about the menace of America's historically large government debt.
But wait, you may object -- he didn't say anything about debt. Indeed he didn't -- not one word. But that's what was so revealing.
After all, Republicans spent the entire Obama administration inveighing constantly about the dangers of debt, warning that America faced a looming crisis unless deficits were drastically reduced. Now that they're in power, however -- and with the deficit surging thanks to a huge tax cut for corporations and the rich -- they've totally dropped the subject.
According to ABC News, Mick Mulvaney, Trump's acting chief of staff, explained to G.O.P. members of Congress why debt wouldn't get a single mention in the SOTU: "Nobody cares."
And you know, he's kind of right. It's not just Republicans who suddenly seemed to stop caring about debt. For years deficit scolds dominated discourse inside the Beltway; much of the news media treated the urgency of fiscal austerity as an unquestioned fact, abandoning the usual rules of reportorial neutrality and plunging into outright advocacy. Yet since Trump's election those voices have become oddly muted.
What we've just seen confirmed, then, is what some of us were trying to tell you from the beginning: All that wailing about debt was hypocritical.
Republicans never actually cared about debt; they just pretended to be deficit hawks as a way to hamstring President Barack Obama's agenda. And many centrists have turned out to have a double standard, reserving passionate concern about debt for times when Democrats hold power.
But while the about-face on debt has, as I said, been deeply revealing, there are still two big questions. First, how much should we care about debt? Second, will a double standard continue to prevail? That is, will the deficit scolds suddenly get vocal again if and when Democrats regain power?
On the first question: One surprising thing about the debt obsession that peaked around 2011 is that it never had much basis in economic analysis. On the contrary, everything we know about fiscal policy says that it's a mistake to focus on deficit reduction when unemployment is high and interest rates are low, as they were when the fiscal scolds were at their loudest.
The case for worrying about debt is stronger now, given low unemployment. But interest rates are still very low by historical standards -- less than 1 percent after adjusting for inflation. This is so low that we needn't fear that debt will snowball, with interest payments blowing up the deficit. It also suggests that we're suffering from chronic weakness in private investment demand (which, by the way, the 2017 tax cut doesn't seem to have boosted at all).
So in the past few months a number of prominent economists -- including the former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund and top economists from the Obama administration -- have published analyses saying that even now, with unemployment quite low, debt is much less of a problem than previously thought.
It's still a bad idea to run up debt for no good reason -- say, to provide tax breaks that corporations just use to buy back their own stock, which is, of course, what the G.O.P. did. But borrowing at ultralow interest rates to pay for investments in the future -- infrastructure, of course, but also things like nutrition and health care for the young, who are the workers of tomorrow -- is very defensible.
Which brings us to the question of double standards.
You don't have to agree with everything in proposals for a "Green New Deal" to acknowledge that it's very much an investment program, not a mere giveaway. So it has been very dismaying to see how much commentary on these proposals either demands an immediate, detailed explanation of how Democrats would pay for their ideas, or dismisses the whole thing as impractical. Was there the same pushback against Republican tax cuts? No.
Look, we've seen this over and over again -- three times since 1980. Republicans rail against budget deficits when they're out of power, then drop all their concerns and send the deficit soaring once they are in a position to cut taxes. Then when it's the Democrats' turn, they're expected to clean up the Republicans' red ink rather than address their own priorities. Enough already.
I'm not saying that Democrats should completely ignore the fiscal implications of their actions. Really big spending plans, especially if they don't clearly involve investment -- for example, a major expansion of federal health spending -- will have to be paid for with new taxes. But if and when Democrats are in a position to make policy, they should be ambitious, and not let the deficit scolds scare them into thinking small.

For Iran, a Grand Occasion To Bash 'Cruel Enemies'

Full text: TEHRAN -- Braving a drenching rain, Iranians came out in droves on Monday to march up Revolution Street to the capital's Freedom Monument, including families pushing strollers decorated with balloons in the red, white and green of the country's flag, clerics, teenagers and others, for a huge state-backed rally commemorating the 40th anniversary of the Islamic revolution.
While such rallies are organized every year on Feb. 11, this year's seemed larger, despite the uninviting weather. And like some evil doppelgÃ¤nger, the United States was omnipresent, despite having broken all ties with Iran in 1981.
"Thank god the revolution is 40 years old," someone shouted through loudspeakers mounted on lampposts along the route. "Where are the Americans to witness this divine rally?"
President Hassan Rouhani, speaking to the sprawling crowd at the Freedom Monument, said the country was in the middle of "a psychological and economical war, waged by cruel enemies." That was a clear reference to the United States and the sanctions the Trump administration reimposed after it unilaterally withdrew from a global deal over Iran's nuclear program.
"We will stand against these sanctions together, and gain victory over America," Mr. Rouhani said, emphasizing that such resistance does not come without costs. "People will face problems, they already have some problems, but we will pass them."
Three men, a father and his two sons, paraded a foam effigy of a smiling President Trump with a bloated head. "Two years ago we made Obama, but this Trump is our best creation to date," said one of the sons, Mohammad Zaerin, 27.
There was no way they would burn it during the rally, he added. "We will donate this effigy to the elementary school in our neighborhood, so the children can learn from it."
In numerous interviews, the rally participants seemed well-informed about the issues facing the country, which are numerous. Economic experts are predicting an inflation rate of as much as 50 percent in the coming year, starting from March 21 in Iran. The government is grappling with a large loss in oil income, attributed to Washington's pressure on buyers combined with low oil prices.
The rial, Iran's currency, has lost nearly 70 percent of its value in the past 12 months, making imports prohibitively expensive. Unemployment is high and industrial production is down. There have been sporadic labor protests, dozens of dissidents have been arrested and security forces are on high alert for possible terror attacks. Mismanagement and corruption, reported on extensively by foreign-based Persian-language satellite channels, have strongly undermined faith in Iran's leaders.
"Every country has issues," said Mina Heydari, 45. "We do too." The mother of two had come out to commemorate not only the revolution but also her brother Mohsen, who had died in the trenches during the bloody eight-year war with Iraq in the 1980s. "We mustn't forget the sacrifices many have made," she said.
Ms. Heydari and others present at the rally pointed to progress made since the revolution, including the participation of women in universities, achievements in nanotechnology and scientific papers.
The anniversary of the revolution has over the years morphed into an ideological carnival, with the national mobile phone operator this year handing out placards saying, "40 years, the revolution has become mature."
Along the route there is entertainment, provided by state organizations. Because the entertainment needs to be Islamic, there were male clowns praising the Iranian flag ("the most beautiful flag in the world"), silver-painted men posing as living statutes and several male choirs, all dressed in gray suits and singing high-pitched a cappella songs in praise of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the founder of the revolution.
In front of a booth run by the tax ministry, not the most beloved institute in the Islamic republic, a lone Shiite cleric, Hojatolislam Ghassem Mohsen Shahroudi, had set up shop under an umbrella to answer questions from passers-by.
Mr. Mohsen Shahroudi, a midlevel cleric, said the revolution had brought Iran freedom and evolution. But he acknowledged that there were Iranians who do not like clerics. "Sometimes the taxis just drive past me," he said, refusing to pick him up. A degree of discontent is "natural," he offered. "Look at the inequality in America, look at the Yellow Vests in France, across the world everybody is unhappy. Iran is no different."
Another cleric, Taghi Mollah Ahmad, passed by and chimed in. "Of course, some people are displeased, but they are unhappy with the government, not with the state and the Islamic republic," he said. "If they were really upset they would come and make large demonstrations, but I'm not seeing that."
Mr. Rouhani praised the crowd's size as a victory for the system he represents, even though many in this city of 12 million stayed home, many out of sheer apathy. "The presence of people today on the streets all over Islamic Iran," he said, "means the enemy will never reach its evil objectives."

South Korea Increases Its Share of Bearing Cost of U.S. Military Presence

Full text: SEOUL, South Korea -- Washington and Seoul on Sunday signed an agreement on how to share the cost of the American military presence in South Korea, resolving a dispute between the allies before President Trump's meeting this month with Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader.
But the one-year deal only temporarily addresses an issue that has become particularly contentious under Mr. Trump, who has insisted that South Korea and other allies shoulder more of the cost of maintaining American bases on their soil.
Under the new deal, Seoul will contribute about 1.04 trillion won, or $925 million, this year to help cover the expense of stationing 28,500 American troops in South Korea. That is an 8.2 percent increase from last year, when South Korea paid 960 billion won, roughly half the total cost.
The agreement, subject to parliamentary approval, was signed in Seoul on Sunday by the chief South Korean negotiator, Chang Won-sam, and his American counterpart, Timothy Betts.
During the negotiations, "the United States reconfirmed its commitment to defending South Korea and made it clear that it was not considering any change in the size of American military presence," the South Korean Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
The statement also said Washington had withdrawn its earlier demand that South Korea provide "operational support," helping to pay the costs of the American soldiers, aircraft carriers and warplanes used in joint military exercises with the South.
Unlike the previous five-year deal, which expired on Dec. 31, the new agreement will cover this year only. The allies will have to resume negotiations within months over how to share next year's costs, giving the United States a chance to press for a far bigger South Korean contribution.
Such talks have always been contentious, but particularly so in the past year.
Negotiations to replace the old agreement went past their December deadline, as South Korea resisted Washington's demand that it raise its contribution by 50 percent.
The deadlock had raised fears that Mr. Trump might propose a withdrawal or reduction of American troops in South Korea as a bargaining chip during his second summit meeting with Mr. Kim, which is set to take place Feb. 27-28 in Hanoi, Vietnam.
North Korea has long campaigned for the troops' withdrawal, arguing that the American military threat had forced it to develop nuclear weapons. At the Vietnam meeting, Mr. Trump is hoping for concrete and verifiable progress toward denuclearizing North Korea.
The 8.2 percent increase falls far short of Mr. Trump's demand, but it is still a major concession for Seoul. When South Korea signed its last cost-sharing deal in 2014, it agreed to a 5.8 percent increase over 2013. Under that deal, South Korea's contribution increased only 1 percent each year from 2015 to 2018, in keeping with domestic inflation rates.
South Korea had also wanted another multiyear deal, to avoid having to negotiate every year. Still, the new one-year deal helps alleviate, even if briefly, concern that Mr. Trump might put the future of American troops in South Korea on the table in the talks with Mr. Kim.
Mr. Trump has often questioned the value of stationing American troops abroad, repeatedly demanding that South Korea and Japan pay more for the defense they provide.
In an interview aired on CBS News on Feb. 3, Mr. Trump again complained that keeping American troops in South Korea was "very expensive" but said he had no plans to bring them home.
"Maybe someday. I mean, who knows," he said. "But I have no plans. I've never even discussed removing them."
But South Koreans are well aware of Mr. Trump's unpredictability.
Emerging from his first summit meeting with Mr. Kim in Singapore last June, Mr. Trump announced he would suspend military exercises on the Korean Peninsula, calling them "tremendously expensive" and "very provocative."
North Korea has long objected to the drills, and many South Koreans were shocked that Mr. Trump would make such a significant concession in return for Mr. Kim's vague promise to "work toward complete denuclearization."
After the June meeting, Mr. Trump boasted that he had "largely solved" the North Korean nuclear crisis. But talks have since stalled over how to implement the Singapore agreement.
Analysts say Mr. Kim may eventually push for a withdrawal of American troops, in the name of building peace and winning security guarantees for his regime. After his Singapore meeting with Mr. Kim, Mr. Trump said he wanted to "get our soldiers out" of South Korea "at some point."
The South's president, Moon Jae-in, has stressed the importance of the military alliance with Washington, insisting that its fate should not be up for discussion in the talks between the North and the United States.
In recent weeks, conservative South Korean commentators have said it is worth paying more for American troops to keep Mr. Trump from withdrawing them. But progressives, including members of Mr. Moon's governing party, are sensitive to any impression that the Americans are bullying their country.
"Trump is not the United States," Bae Myung-bok, a senior columnist for the daily JoongAng Ilbo, wrote last month, urging South Korea not to give in to Washington's demands.
The United States military command was established in 1957, when South Korea was a largely agrarian country. As it transformed into a global trading power, South Korea's contribution to covering the cost of American troops has increased along with its defense budget.
Not counted as part of South Korea's contribution to the shared defense costs are large tracts of land that it supplies rent-free for American military bases. South Korea has also taken on more than 90 percent of the $11 billion cost of expanding Camp Humphreys, south of Seoul, into the largest American military base outside the continental United States.
South Korea is also one of the biggest buyers of American weapons. It spends 2.5 percent of its gross domestic product on defense, more than any European ally of the United States.

One Cheer For the Green New Deal

Full text: The first major policy intervention from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the noted social-media personality and future dictator-for-life of the Americas (I believe she's also a congresswoman of some sort), is a quite-extraordinary document: a blueprint for fighting climate change that manages to confirm every conservative critique of liberal environmental activism, every Republican suspicion of what global-warming alarm is really all about.
The core conservative suspicion is that when liberals talk about the dire threat of global warming, they're actually seizing opportunistically on the issue to justify, well, #fullsocialism -- the seizure of the economy's commanding heights in order to implement the most left-wing possible agenda.
A conventional liberal, up until now, would dismiss that belief as simply paranoid, the product of Fox News feedback loops and the science-denying fever swamps. But the Green New Deal that Ocasio-Cortez and Massachusetts Senator Edward Markey are sponsoring -- and that four leading Democratic contenders for the presidency have already endorsed -- responds by saying: Yes, that's absolutely correct.
[ Listen to "The Argument" podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt. ]
It isn't just that the Green New Deal proposes a 10-year plan for decarbonizing the American economy that would involve the kind of "war socialism" unseen since, well, World War II (a model the authors explicitly evoke). It isn't just that it dismisses all worries about deficits or inflation with a Venezuelan insouciance, or that it seems lukewarm about any policy or technology that might be tainted by capitalism or disliked by progressive interest groups.
It's also that the list of proposed policies for fighting climate change is filled with what even David Roberts of Vox, in the course of praising the Green New Deal, admits are "eyebrow-raising doozies," with everything from universal health care to a job guarantee draped under the mantle of environmentalism. And that's just in the official language of the (nonbinding, it should be noted) resolution: The Frequently Asked Questions that temporarily accompanied the New Deal's rollout is even more striking in its green just means everything progressives want ambition.
So there's a pretty easy story to tell here about why, if the Democratic Party makes the Green New Deal vision its own, that shift will empower climate-change skeptics, weaken the hand of would-be compromisers in the G.O.P. and put the kind of climate-change package that could win at least 51 votes in the Senate even further out of reach. And also possibly help Donald Trump win re-election.
But let me temper this critique by finding two positive things to say about the Green New Deal, which between them will add up to the single cheer promised in this op-ed's title.
First, in moving somewhat away from the longstanding centrist emphasis on pricing carbon -- via carbon taxes or a cap-and-trade system -- toward a focus on direct spending, the left might be moving away from theoretical efficiency toward political feasibility.
The experience of the developed world is that carbon pricing schemes look really good in theory, but tend to either get compromised toward inefficiency in practice or else inspire populist uprisings like the gilets jaunes in France. And buried inside the sweeping command-and-control vision of the Green New Deal is the material for a more modest alternative: basically, an emphasis on research and resilience, which would spend more money on basic science, alternative-energy adaptations and mitigation in the communities most likely to be affected by storms and tides and heat.
This would point to a different zone of compromise than the one often debated up till now. Instead of centrist elites compromising to raise energy taxes that often fall heavily on the working class, you could imagine left-populists and right-populists compromising on adaptationist public works, on "big, beautiful" infrastructure projects (to borrow our president's rhetoric) that don't pretend to solve climate change but do mitigate its consequences.
If the sweeping ambition of the Green New Deal leads to positive incremental change, I think that's the most likely way it happens. But then I also want to mildly praise the resolution's anti-incrementalism -- because there are virtues in trying to offer not just a technical blueprint but a comprehensive vision of the good society, and virtues as well in insisting that dramatic change is still possible in America, that grand projects and scientific breakthroughs are still within our reach.
They might not be, since the United States is presently decadent -- with a stalemated politics, an aging and risk-averse population, a balkanized culture -- in ways that may limit our ability to recreate the specific projects of the past and preclude a regained conception of the common good.
But the desire not to be a decadent society is a healthy one, and in that sense the Green New Deal deserves credit for looking at the American past and saying, in effect: Why not us, again?
So that's my faint praise. Enough, I hope, to earn my energy-efficient cabin an extra solar panel, bestowed by the beneficence of First Citizen AOC, in the utopia to come.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Over the past two weeks, President Trump has repeatedly boasted of being a boon for the military. He has trumpeted the Pentagon's $700 billion budget, taken credit for staving off a "major war" with North Korea and generally declared victory on all things related to the United States' armed forces.
"Look, I accomplished the military," Mr. Trump said, in a perplexing verbal offering at the Oval Office in recent days.
But has he? A look at two years of the military under Mr. Trump produces a report card with plenty of incompletes and far more failing grades from national security experts than the A+ the commander in chief has awarded himself.
Mr. Trump's expressed love for the men he called "my generals" has given way to chillier climes. At the Pentagon, senior officials joke about having a half-life with Mr. Trump, one whose longevity is determined by whether they can steer clear of the president. Mr. Trump so often overlooked the advice of the Pentagon that his defense secretary resigned in December, citing irreconcilable differences.
Mr. Trump has also undermined the authority of his most senior military leader, Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., announcing his successor as the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff almost a full year before his term is up. That has sown confusion about command guidance throughout the ranks of the sprawling military bureaucracy.
And even on the budget question -- Mr. Trump's prime example of his military accomplishments -- defense experts said the verdict was not quite as cut and dried as the president made it sound. Here is a look at two years of Mr. Trump's chief military accomplishments.
A return to Obama-era funding
On Mr. Trump's signature boast, military spending, the Pentagon is at levels last seen under ... President Barack Obama. The $700 billion that Mr. Trump trumpets is actually less than what Mr. Obama spent on war and military in the 2010 fiscal year, when adjusted for inflation.
According to the Office of Management and Budget's calculations, actual military spending under Mr. Obama in 2010 was $851 billion. Even after subtracting military-related spending from other agencies -- including the Departments of Homeland Security, Veterans Affairs and State -- Mr. Obama budgeted $690 billion in 2010 for the Pentagon and war spending.
That included funds for winding down the war in Iraq and ramping up the war in Afghanistan. When adjusted for inflation, the total came to around $795 billion in current funding.
Mandatory spending cuts by Congress that went into place in 2011 meant that military spending went down in the later years of Mr. Obama's term. So Mr. Trump can accurately say that he has increased military spending since then.
But under Mr. Trump, the military is also smaller than it was when it peaked during the Obama administration. There are currently 1.2 million active-duty service members, compared with 1.4 million in 2011.
Outlining his plans for the military during a national security speech in Philadelphia in 2016 when he was campaigning for president, Mr. Trump called for an expansion of the military and 75 new ships for the Navy.
Today, the Navy says it will add 10 more ships than what Mr. Obama had planned to build during the same period -- from now to 2024.
"Has Trump made the military bigger? No," said Todd Harrison, a budget expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "Stronger? That's a qualitative argument, but it's hard to point to anything that says the military is stronger than it was before he came into office."
The only technical addition that Mr. Trump can point to is the slight difference in spending, Mr. Harrison said, noting that it is a fine point at best. "He's accomplished spending more," he said. "That's it."
War in North Korea
Mr. Trump credits himself with averting a war with North Korea. "If I had not been elected president of the United States, we would right now, in my opinion, be in a major war with North Korea," he said during the State of the Union address last week.
But it was he who elevated the possibility of war from the start.
In January 2018, the president took to Twitter to threaten a nuclear war with North Korea, warning its leader, Kim Jong-un, "that I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works!"
At several points in 2017 and early 2018, Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim traded insults like "rocket man" and "dotard." Pentagon officials said they became so concerned about the escalating tensions that senior members of Mr. Trump's national security team held teleconference calls to monitor the trajectory of North Korean missiles, fearing that a conflict would be incited if the weapons flew close enough to, say, Guam, home to a strategic American air base.
During a summit meeting in June, Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim signed a joint statement agreeing to take steps toward disarming North Korea's nuclear arsenal. But satellite images show that the North may still be pursuing a nuclear program.
The two leaders are due to meet again -- in Hanoi, Vietnam, this month. Since their meeting in Singapore, Mr. Trump has softened his threats of war against North Korea. But he is toning it down from what he turned up himself.
That trans-Atlantic military treaty
During the State of the Union address, Mr. Trump said that after years of seeing the United States "treated very unfairly by NATO," he was forcing other nations in the military alliance to pay their fair share.
This is true -- if the definition of fair share means increased domestic military spending by each member state of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
Still, national security experts said that Mr. Trump's congratulations should extend not only to Mr. Obama but also to Presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton.
Just about every American president has prodded other states in the Atlantic alliance to spend more on their own national defense. In 2014, during the Obama administration, each alliance member pledged to spend 2 percent of its gross domestic product on its own defense each year by 2024.
At last year's annual meeting of NATO heads of state in Brussels, Mr. Trump unexpectedly demanded that alliance members spend 4 percent of their G.D.P. on defense. (That demand was ignored.)
He also warned that the United States would "go its own way" if members did not start spending more. (And he told aides he wanted to pull out of the alliance altogether, a suggestion that his top national security officials ignored in hopes that it would go away.)
Mr. Trump's demands have put NATO in what national security experts said is possibly the most precarious position since the military alliance was formed 70 years ago. But even as allies fret that the United States might withdraw from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, military spending among member states has continued growth levels that began under Mr. Obama.
Still, Mr. Trump's "I accomplished the military" claim makes a strange kind of sense, said Jason K. Dempsey, a veteran of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the author of "Our Army: Soldiers, Politics and American Civil-Military Relations."
"I don't think anything more perfectly articulates the dysfunctional relationship between this president and the military," Mr. Dempsey said. "We can claim a positive without it making grammatical sense."

Full text: When President Trump delivered his State of the Union address on Tuesday, he could quite justifiably say that the state of the economy was good.
Unemployment is low, inflation is muted and growth has continued unabated for nearly 10 years. As a college professor, I'm often drawn to giving letter grades, and would give the United States economy an A-, with the potential for a better grade if the economic gains had been distributed more evenly.
But Mr. Trump controls economic policy, not the economy, and so a fairer report card would also assess his actual policies.
To provide a nonpartisan appraisal, I've reviewed surveys of about 50 leading economists -- liberals and conservatives -- run by the University of Chicago. What is startling is that the economists are nearly unanimous in concluding that Mr. Trump's policies are destructive. That is why many economists are uneasy about his presidency, even though the economy earns solid grades.
Trade Policy: F
Mr. Trump's protectionist impulses place him squarely at odds with the economic wisdom that tariffs are harmful. Worse, by imposing tariffs on goods like aluminum and steel Mr. Trump's trade policy has also damaged the competitiveness of American manufacturers. None of the economists taking part in the surveys agreed with the claim that these tariffs would "improve Americans' welfare," and all of them said global supply chains had made these tariffs more costly than they would have been in the past.
The United States started a trade war with China and China quickly retaliated, raising tariffs on American-made goods. Mr. Trump also created needless uncertainty with his threat to rip up the North American Free Trade Agreement that binds the United States, Canada and Mexico. The threat yielded a substitute deal that market economists believe will do little more than replicate the previous one, and it is unclear that Congress will pass it.
Criticism of Mr. Trump's protectionist instincts is widespread. When he said on Twitter that he was "Tariff Man," financial markets tanked. An analysis conducted by the president's own Council of Economic Advisers has reportedly concluded that his tariffs will reduce economic growth. Even by Mr. Trump's own preferred metric, the balance of trade, his policy has failed: The trade deficit has risen to a 10-year high.
Fiscal Policy: D-
The logic of fiscal policy is straightforward: In good times, the government should spend less, so that in bad times it can afford to spend more and tax less, helping to support an ailing economy. When private-sector demand falls, government picks up the slack.
On this score, Mr. Trump's fiscal policy is a colossal failure. His signature achievement is a $1.5 trillion tax cut that provided stimulus when, arguably, it was least needed. As a result, the budget deficit is atypically high for a healthy economy, and rising government debt will make it hard for fiscal policy to provide a boost when the next downturn hits.
Mr. Trump might argue that the point of the tax cut wasn't to provide a short-term stimulus, but rather to promote long-term economic growth. However, economists say that it will fail to do that, too. In a survey before the bill was passed, all but one expert said the tax cut wouldn't lead gross domestic product "to be substantially higher a decade from now." Darrell Duffie, the lone dissenter, said it would boost growth, but he added that "whether the overall tax plan is distributionally fair is another matter."
The problem, according to Daron Acemoglu, a prominent macroeconomist, is that while "simplification of the tax code could be beneficial," that effect would most likely be "more than offset by its highly regressive nature." Recent data support this pessimism, as the much-promised investment boom the tax cut was supposed to deliver appears not to have materialized.
It is worth noting that the one part of Mr. Trump's platform that received a strong endorsement from economists -- his promise of infrastructure spending -- has languished, despite the possibility of bipartisan support.
Monetary Policy: C
For a president, monetary policy should be simple: Appoint good people, and let the Federal Reserve do its job. Mr. Trump has got half of this right. Jerome Powell, his pick for Fed chairman, has so far proven to be adept. In a recent survey, 43 percent of economists gave Mr. Powell's leadership an A, and 51 percent gave him a B (with the remaining 6 percent giving him a C). Mr. Trump's other Fed appointments have been mainstream, yielding a cast of policymakers that Jeb Bush might have appointed had he been elected president.
But Mr. Trump has dragged down his grade in this category by meddling in ways that have needlessly complicated the Fed's job. Most industrialized countries, including the United States, have generally insulated monetary policy from political pressure, believing that such independence helps policymakers deliver low and stable inflation. Yet Mr. Trump has repeatedly criticized Mr. Powell for not setting interest rates lower, and has reportedly raised the possibility of firing him. The president is playing a self-defeating game, because he is making it harder for Mr. Powell to deliver low rates without appearing to have been bullied by Mr. Trump.
Deciphering a Puzzle
Mr. Trump isn't just pushing against one or two threads of economic consensus. Instead, his program is an almost complete repudiation of the orthodoxies endorsed by Democratic and Republican economists.
Put the pieces together, and all of this presents a puzzle: If economic policy is so bad, why is the economy doing so well?
Perhaps it reflects good luck rather than good judgment. Mr. Trump's luck was to inherit an economy that had been on a steadily improving glide path since around 2010. Charting nearly any economic statistic shows that today's economic strength represents a continuation of that trend.
Even if Mr. Trump doesn't deserve credit for this trajectory, he should get some credit for not knocking the economy off this path. Unless, of course, the real explanation is that the president doesn't have much effect on economic outcomes.
The more frightening explanation is that the downside of Mr. Trump's policies are yet to become evident. The chaos of his administration's policy process has created uncertainty and probably scared off some investors, although their absence is difficult to measure. In addition, Mr. Trump's unfunded tax cuts are creating a debt that future generations will have to repay. And by undermining the Fed's independence, he may have made it less effective at fighting inflation.
That's not all.
Cutting regulations in the financial sector may help big banks today, but it could increase the chances of future financial crises. Eliminating environmental regulations has probably improved results for some businesses while speeding climate change. And while impeding immigration may have reduced competition for jobs, many economists worry that in the longer run, reducing the number of immigrants will lead to less innovation and growth.
Of course, I should admit a final possibility: Perhaps Mr. Trump has got it right, and the economists have gotten it all wrong. As a card-carrying economist, I don't believe this, but it seems that, in equal measure, Mr. Trump doesn't believe what economists say, either.

Statistics and Superlatives, and Truths, Exaggerations and Falsehoods

Full text: President Trump leaned hard on the strength of the American economy during his second State of the Union address on Tuesday, but with a blend of precise statistics and gauzy superlatives that are much more difficult to measure.
He also returned to a theme that dominated the second year of his presidency -- a quest for a border wall with Mexico to cope with what he said is a crisis of crime and drugs in the United States caused by illegal immigration.
The two issues dominated his address, which in tone was more measured than his biting Twitter feed, but in substance contained numerous claims that were false or misleading.
Here is what Mr. Trump said and how it stacked up against the facts.
The economy
"The U.S. economy is growing almost twice as fast today as when I took office, and we are considered far and away the hottest economy anywhere in the world."
This is false.
The American economy expanded at an annual rate of 3.5 percent in the third quarter of 2018. Growth in Latvia and Poland was almost twice as fast. Same for China and India. Even the troubled Greek economy posted stronger growth. And a wide range of economic analysts estimate that the growth of the American economy slowed in the fourth quarter, and slowed even further in the first month of 2019.
"We recently imposed tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods -- and now our Treasury is receiving billions and billions of dollars."
This is true.
Since Mr. Trump imposed tariffs on certain imports from China -- and imported steel and aluminum from around the world -- federal tariff revenues have increased. Revenues from customs duties, which include tariffs, rose by $13 billion in the third quarter of 2018 compared with a year earlier, the Commerce Department reported. Technically, that money is paid by Americans who bring the goods across the border, and it is often passed on to American consumers in the form of higher prices.
"My administration has cut more regulations in a short period of time than any other administration during its entire tenure."
This is false.
The Trump administration has slowed the pace of adopting new rules, and it has moved to roll back some existing or proposed federal regulations, particularly in the area of environmental protection. The White House claimed that as of October, a total of $33 billion worth of future regulator costs had been eliminated. But experts say the scale of the rollbacks in the Trump era still does not exceed extensive cuts in federal rules during the Carter and Reagan administrations, when rules governing airline, truck and rail transportation were wiped off the books, among other changes.
"We have created 5.3 million new jobs and importantly added 600,000 new manufacturing jobs -- something which almost everyone said was impossible to do, but the fact is, we are just getting started."
This is false.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that since January 2017, when Mr. Trump took office, the economy has added 4.9 million jobs, including 454,000 jobs manufacturing jobs. Far from being "impossible," that is closely comparable to the pace of job creation during some two-year periods during the Obama administration, and significantly slower than the pace of job creation in manufacturing in the 1990s.
Wages were "growing for blue-collar workers, who I promised to fight for. They are growing faster than anyone thought possible."
This is true.
Wages are rising faster for construction and manufacturing workers than workers in service occupations, according to the Labor Department.
"More people are working now than at any time in our history."
This is misleading.
While the total number of people working in the United States is higher than ever, it is not because of the president's policies. It is because more people than ever live in the United States.
______
Immigration
"The border city of El Paso, Tex., used to have extremely high rates of violent crime -- one of the highest in the entire country, and considered one of our nation's most dangerous cities. Now, immediately upon its building, with a powerful barrier in place, El Paso is one of the safest cities in our country."
This is false.
El Paso was never one of the most dangerous cities in the United States, and crime has been declining in cities across the country -- not just El Paso -- for reasons that have nothing to do with border fencing. In 2008, before border barriers had been completed in El Paso, the city had the second-lowest violent crime rate among more than 20 similarly sized cities. In 2010, after the fencing went up, it held that place.
"San Diego used to have the most illegal border crossings in our country. In response, a strong security wall was put in place. This powerful barrier almost completely ended illegal crossings."
This is misleading.
Border apprehensions decreased by 91 percent in the San Diego sector between the 1994 fiscal year, right after the original border fencing was completed, to the 2018 fiscal year. But, according to the Congressional Research Service, that fence alone "did not have a discernible impact" on the number of immigrants crossing the border into the United States illegally.
"As we speak, large, organized caravans are on the march to the United States."
This is exaggerated.
At the end of January, a new caravan of thousands of migrants from Central America was headed north, and some of the travelers said they intended to try to cross into the United States. But many in the caravan have said they plan to remain in Mexico, thanks in part to policies put in place by the new Mexican government. President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador has made it easier for Central Americans to get visas and work in Mexico. President Trump's warnings of an imminent invasion from new caravans is overstated.
"I hope you can pass the U.S.M.C.A. into law, so we can bring back our manufacturing jobs in even greater numbers, expanding American agriculture, protecting intellectual property, and ensuring that more cars are proudly stamped with the four beautiful words: Made in the U.S.A."
This is exaggerated.
The revised trade deal with Canada and Mexico, known as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, does include provisions that are intended to bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States -- like minimum wage provisions for some auto manufacturing. But some economists have said those provisions could ultimately push more manufacturing -- and jobs -- outside North America. The deal does allow American farmers to sell more dairy products to Canada. But the trade pact has yet to be approved by Congress, and both Democrats and Republicans say that is unlikely to happen without significant changes.
______
Foreign policy
"When I took office, ISIS controlled more than 20,000 square miles in Iraq and Syria. Just two years ago. Today, we have liberated virtually all of the territory from the grip of these bloodthirsty monsters."
This is true.
The Defense Department reports that the Islamic State now controls only around 20 square miles of territory in Syria, down from 34,000 in 2014. But many of the gains against the Sunni extremist caliphate began under President Barack Obama, with the Trump administration continuing Obama administration policy. And the top American military commander in the Middle East told a Senate hearing on Tuesday that the Islamic State could return if the United States and its allies abandoned the fight. In December, Mr. Trump announced he was withdrawing American troops from Syria.
"We condemn the brutality of the Maduro regime, whose socialist policies have turned that nation from being the wealthiest in South America into a state of abject poverty and despair."
This is misleading.
This has become a popular talking point among American conservatives. It is true that the rule of President NicolÃ¡s Maduro of Venezuela has brought that country to economic ruin. Inflation is at astronomical rates, and ordinary people are struggling to get basic food and health supplies. Three million citizens have fled. Some of the collapse can be traced to Mr. Maduro's economic policies, which do fall under the broad label of socialism. But analysts say that corruption, the lack of rule of law and the absence of democracy -- all the hallmarks of a dictatorship -- have played just as big or larger roles.
"If I had not been elected president of the United States, we would right now, in my opinion, be in a major war with North Korea."
There is no evidence.
In 2016, at the end of the Obama administration, there was no sign that the United States and North Korea were about to go to war, though Pyongyang had been conducting nuclear tests and Mr. Obama had continued economic sanctions. In Mr. Trump's first year in office, he increased tensions with North Korea by attacking its leader, Kim Jong-un, in a series of Twitter posts, which prompted hostile statements from Pyongyang. Mr. Trump wrote that North Korea's actions would be met with "fire and fury" and called Mr. Kim "Little Rocket Man." Analysts said at the time that the chances of war between the two nations had grown because of these exchanges.

Abortion
"Lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother's womb moments from birth."
This is misleading.
On Jan. 22, the 46th anniversary of the Supreme Court's landmark decision Roe v. Wade, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, Democrat of New York, signed the Reproductive Health Act. The new law ensures a woman's right to an abortion in New York if Roe v. Wade were to be overturned. It does not broadly allow abortions until shortly before birth, as Mr. Trump suggested. Instead, it will allow for an abortion after 24 weeks to protect the mother's health or if the fetus is not viable. Under the prior law, abortions were allowed after 24 weeks only if the woman's life was in jeopardy.
"We had the case of the governor of Virginia where he stated he would execute a baby after birth."
This is false.
In an interview last month, Gov. Ralph Northam said that he supported a late-term abortion bill that would loosen restrictions on the procedure, and allow women to consult with a doctor on an abortion up to, but not including, the time of birth.
The governor, a pediatric neurologist, also talked about some of the dangerous medical emergencies that pregnant women could face, such as carrying a nonviable fetus. He said that in such a case, the mother would deliver the infant and then, "the infant would be resuscitated if that's what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother." While Mr. Northam was talking about an end-of-life care discussion in the case of a child that would not live, Republicans seized on his remarks as evidence that Mr. Northam supported killing babies after their birth.

Full text: From the mid-20th century until the 1970s, American corporations shared a belief that they had a duty not only to their shareholders but to their workers, their communities and the country that created the economic conditions and legal protections for them to thrive. It created an extremely prosperous America for working people and the broad middle of the country.
But over the past several decades, corporate boardrooms have become obsessed with maximizing only shareholder earnings to the detriment of workers and the long-term strength of their companies, helping to create the worst level of income inequality in decades.
One way in which this pervasive corporate ethos manifests itself is the explosion of stock buybacks.
So focused on shareholder value, companies, rather than investing in ways to make their businesses more resilient or their workers more productive, have been dedicating ever larger shares of their profits to dividends and corporate share repurchases. When a company purchases its own stock back, it reduces the number of publicly traded shares, boosting the value of the stock to the benefit of shareholders and corporate leadership.
Between 2008 and 2017, 466 of the S&P 500 companies spent around $4 trillion on stock buybacks, equal to 53 percent of profits. Another 30 percent of corporate profits went to dividends. When more than 80 percent of corporate profits go to buybacks and dividends, there is reason to be concerned.
This practice of corporate self-indulgence is not new, but it's grown enormously. Fueled by the Trump tax cut, in 2018, United States corporations repurchased more than $1 trillion of their own stock, a staggering figure and the highest amount ever authorized in a single year.
This has become an enormous problem for workers and for the long-term strength of the economy for two main reasons.
First, stock buybacks don't benefit the vast majority of Americans. That's because large stockholders tend to be wealthier. Nearly 85 percent of all stocks owned by Americans belong to the wealthiest 10 percent of households. Of course, many corporate executives are compensated through stock-based pay. So when a company buys back its stock, boosting its value, the benefits go overwhelmingly to shareholders and executives, not workers.
Second, when corporations direct resources to buy back shares on this scale, they restrain their capacity to reinvest profits more meaningfully in the company in terms of R&D, equipment, higher wages, paid medical leave, retirement benefits and worker retraining.
It's no coincidence that at the same time that corporate stock buybacks and dividends have reached record highs, the median wages of average workers have remained relatively stagnant. Far too many workers have watched corporate executives cash in on corporate stock buybacks while they get handed a pink slip.
Recently, Walmart announced plans to spend $20 billion on a share repurchase program while laying off thousands of workers and closing dozens of Sam's Club stores. Using a fraction of that amount, the company could have raised hourly wages of every single Walmart employee to $15, according to an analysis by the Roosevelt Institute.
Walmart is not alone. Harley Davidson authorized a 15 million share stock-repurchase around the same time it announced it would close a plant in Kansas City, Mo. And Wells Fargo has spent billions on corporate stock buybacks while openly plotting to lay off thousands of workers in the coming years.
At a time of huge income and wealth inequality, Americans should be outraged that these profitable corporations are laying off workers while spending billions of dollars to boost their stock's value to further enrich the wealthy few. If corporations continue to purchase their own stock at this rate, income disparities will continue to grow, productivity will suffer, the long-term strength of companies will diminish -- and the American worker will fall further behind.
That is why we are planning to introduce bold legislation to address this crisis. Our bill will prohibit a corporation from buying back its own stock unless it invests in workers and communities first, including things like paying all workers at least $15 an hour, providing seven days of paid sick leave, and offering decent pensions and more reliable health benefits.
In other words, our legislation would set minimum requirements for corporate investment in workers and the long-term strength of the company as a precondition for a corporation entering into a share buyback plan. The goal is to curtail the overreliance on buybacks while also incentivizing the productive investment of corporate capital.
Some may argue that if Congress limits stock buybacks, corporations could shift to issuing larger dividends. This is a valid concern -- and we should also seriously consider policies to limit the payout of dividends, perhaps through the tax code.
Why wouldn't it be better for our national economy if, instead of buying back stock, corporations paid all of their workers better wages and provided good benefits? Why should a company whose pension program is underfunded be able to buy back stock before shoring up the pension fund?
Whichever way a corporation chooses to invest in its workers, what's clear to the vast majority of Americans is that companies should devote resources to workers and communities before buying back stock.
So, in this Congress, the two of us will attempt to get a vote on legislation that demands that corporations commit to addressing the needs of their workers and communities before the interests of their wealthy stockholders.
The past two years have been extremely disappointing for millions of workers. President Trump promised the typical American household a $4,000 pay raise as he pushed for his tax giveaway to the rich. The reality, however, is that from December 2017 to December 2018, real wages for average workers have gone up by just $9.11 a week. Sadly, average workers are making less today than they made in 1973 after adjusting for inflation, while stock buybacks have skyrocketed to record levels.
The time is long overdue for us to create an economy that works for all Americans, not just the people on top. Our legislation will be an important step in that direction.

Full text: In most histories of how Americans became so polarized, the Great Inflation of the 1970s is given short shrift -- sometimes no shrift at all. This is wrong. Inflation was as pivotal a factor in our national crackup as Vietnam and Watergate.
Inflation changed how Americans thought about their economic relationships to their fellow citizens -- which is to say, inflation and its associated economic traumas changed who we were as a people. It also called into question the economic assumptions that had guided the country since World War II, opening the door for new assumptions that have governed us ever since. Here is the story:
The United States of the 1960s experienced many social upheavals. But in one realm, all was copacetic. The economy roared. The gross domestic product was increasing between 2 percent and 6 percent, wages grew, jobs were stable. The year 1968 was an annus horribilis -- assassinations, riots, a bitter presidential race. But the Economic Report of the President for that year reflected at length on -- imagine this -- "the problem of prosperity."
Slowly, though, inflation entered the picture. It hit 5.7 percent in 1970, then 11 percent in 1974. Such sustained inflation was something that had never happened in stable postwar America. And it was punishing. For a family of modest means, a trip to the supermarket was now a walk over hot coals.
How different this was from previous economic crises! The Great Depression, the 20th century's first economic emergency, made most Americans feel a degree of neighborly solidarity. The government wasn't measuring median household income in the 1930s, but a 2006 Department of Labor study pegged the average household income of 1934-36 at $1,524. Adjust for inflation to 2018, that's about $28,000, while the official poverty level for a family of four was $25,100. In other words, the average family of 1936 was near poor. Everyone was in it together, and if Bill couldn't find work, his neighbor would give him a head of cabbage, a slab of pork belly.
But the Great Inflation, as the author Joe Nocera has noted, made most people feel they had to look out for themselves. Americans had spent decades just getting more and more ahead. Now, suddenly, they were falling behind.
Throw in wage stagnation, which began in the early '70s, and deindustrialization of the great cities of the North. Pennsylvania's Homestead Works, which had employed 20,000 men during the war, started shrinking, closing forever in 1986. Today that tract of land along the Monongahela River where the works once stood is home to the usual chain restaurants and big-box stores, those ubiquitous playpens of the low-wage economy.
Inflation also produced the manic search for "yield" -- it was no longer enough to save money; your money had to make money, turning every wage earner into a player in market rapaciousness. The money market account was born in the 1970s. Personal investing took off (remember "When E.F. Hutton talks, people listen"?).
Even as Americans scrambled for return, they also sought to spend. Credit cards, which had barely existed in 1970, began to proliferate. The Supreme Court's 1978 decision in Marquette National Bank of Minneapolis v. First of Omaha Service Corporation opened the floodgates for banks to issue credit cards with high interest rates. Total credit card balances began to explode.
Then along came Ronald Reagan. The great secret to his success was not his uncomplicated optimism or his instinct for seizing a moment. It was that he freed people of the responsibility of introspection, released them from the guilt in which liberalism seemed to want to make them wallow. And so came the 1980s, when the culture started to celebrate wealth and acquisition as never before. A television series called "Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous" debuted in 1984.
So that was the first change flowing from the Great Inflation: Americans became a more acquisitive -- bluntly, a more selfish -- people. The second change was far more profound.
For decades after World War II, the economic assumptions that undergirded policymaking were basically those of John Maynard Keynes. His "demand side" theories -- increase demand via public investment, even if it meant running a short-term deficit -- guided the New Deal, the financing of the war and pretty much all policy thinking thereafter. And not just among Democrats: Dwight Eisenhower and Richard Nixon were Keynesians.
There had been a group of economists, mostly at the University of Chicago and led by Milton Friedman, who dissented from Keynes. They argued against government intervention and for lower taxes and less regulation. As Keynesian principles promoted demand side, their theories promoted the opposite: supply side.
They'd never won much of an audience, as long as things were working. But now things weren't, in a big way. Inflation was Keynesianism's Achilles' heel, and the supply-siders aimed their arrow right at it. Reagan cut taxes significantly. Inflation ended (which was really the work of Paul Volcker, the chairman of the Federal Reserve). The economy boomed. Economic debate changed; even the way economics was taught changed.
And this, more or less, is where we've been ever since. Yes, we've had two Democratic presidents in that time, both of whom defied supply-side principles at key junctures. But walk down a street and ask 20 people a few questions about economic policy -- I bet most will say that taxes must be kept low, even on rich people, and that we should let the market, not the government, decide on investments. Point to the hospital up the street and tell them that it wouldn't even be there without the millions in federal dollars of various kinds it takes in every year, and they'll mumble and shrug.
There are signs this mind-set is changing. The Trump tax cut of 2017 is consistently unpopular. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York, speaks of a top marginal tax rate of 70 percent on income over $10 million, and instead of getting laughed out of town, she prompts a serious public debate.
Still, we have a long way to go. Dislodging 40-year-old assumptions is a huge job. The Democrats, for starters, have to develop and defend a plausible alternative theory of growth.
But others have a responsibility here too -- notably, our captains of commerce. They have enormous power, and in a country this polarized, they can move moderate and maybe even conservative public opinion in a way that Democratic politicians, civic leaders and celebrities cannot.
They will always be rich. But they have to decide what kind of country they want to be rich in. A place of more and more tax cuts for them, where states keep slashing their higher-education spending and tuitions keep skyrocketing; where the best job opportunity in vast stretches of America is selling opioids; where many young people no longer believe in capitalism and record numbers of them would leave this country if they could? Or a country more like the one they and their parents grew up in, where we invested in ourselves and where work produced a fair and livable wage?
The Great Inflation was an inflection point that changed us for the worse. This moment can be another such point, but one that will change us for the better.

Indexes Eke Out Gains to Extend Rally

Full text: Stocks capped a bumpy day of trading Friday with modest gains, extending the market's winning streak to its third straight day.
Gains in technology companies, energy stocks and banks outweighed losses in retailers and elsewhere in the market.
Major indexes were higher much of the morning as investors applauded a burst of hiring in January by employers. That enthusiasm was tempered, however, by a disappointing revenue outlook from Amazon.
The solid jobs report came two days after investors got encouraging news from the Federal Reserve, which confirmed that it would be "patient" in deciding when to raise interest rates.
That policy shift, which the Fed signaled early last month, helped spur a turnaround in the market that led to January closing out with the biggest monthly gain since 2015.
That strong finish to the month, in addition to the latest jobs report, may have given some investors reason to take a breather on Friday, resulting in the market barely squeaking out a gain.
"There's going to be a vacuum of positive catalysts next week, with the exception of a few individual earnings reports," said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab. "With this type of a rally behind us, it just looks to me like we're running out of a little bit of steam here in the near term."
The S&P 500 index rose 2.43 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,706.53. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 64.22 points, or 0.3 percent, to 25,063.89. The Nasdaq composite dropped 17.87 points, or 0.2 percent, to 7,263.87. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies picked up 2.64 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,502.05.
Stocks got an early boost on Friday as investors welcomed the latest monthly hiring snapshot.
Employers added 304,000 jobs in January, far more than the 165,000 that economists were expecting. The government also revised its December figures sharply lower, to 222,000 from 312,000. Even with the revision, hiring has accelerated since last summer, a development that has surprised economists, because hiring typically slows when unemployment is so low.
Despite the strong jobs report, investors are seeing signs of weakness elsewhere in the global economy. Inflation among the 19 countries that use the euro eased in January, a sign of weakness in a region already facing many challenges. Italy is in a recession and Britain appears to be headed for a disorderly exit from the European Union.
In the United States, consumer confidence fell in January for a third straight month. The housing market is slumping as mortgage rates steadily increase. Sales of existing homes plunged in December and fell 3.1 percent in 2018.
The protracted trade war between the United States and its trading partners continues to be a significant worry for investors. On Friday, the European Union introduced new measures to prevent steel produced for the American market from flooding into Europe.
Amazon's latest outlook weighed on the broader retail sector Friday. The company cashed in on a strong holiday shopping season, and its quarterly earnings topped $3 billion for the first time. Both profit and revenue beat Wall Street forecasts, but the results did not outweigh disappointment over the company's outlook.
Amazon expects sales between $56 billion and $60 billion, while Wall Street analysts expected $60 billion. The stock fell 5.4 percent to 1,626.23.
Benchmark U.S. crude rose 2.7 percent to $55.26 per barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, rose 3.1 percent to $62.75 in London.
Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 2.68 percent from 2.64 percent late Thursday.
The dollar strengthened to 109.51 yen from 108.9 yen on Thursday. The euro weakened versus the dollar to $1.1457 from $1.1446.
Gold fell 0.2 percent to $1,316.90 an ounce.

Full text: CARACAS, Venezuela -- Venezuela is on the brink. Grocery shelves lie empty as food becomes increasingly scarce and expensive. People are fleeing the country at record rates, flooding neighboring countries. Inflation is set to reach 10 million percent in 2019.
In this landscape of desperation, public outrage was already coming to a head when last week, Juan GuaidÃ³, the opposition leader and head of the National Assembly, declared himself interim president. The recently re-elected President NicolÃ¡s Maduro has vowed to continue on.
International attention swiftly turned to the two men at the center of the struggle for control of the country. But in the midst of the political push-and-pull, average Venezuelans are still struggling to get by in a country that has grown increasingly violent and where food shortages, electricity cuts and water shortages are the new normal. Deadly crackdowns on dissent are regular.
Anti-government demonstrations are planned for Caracas on Saturday, and with discontent growing, new groups are taking to the streets, including those who were once staunch supporters of Mr. Maduro and his predecessor, Hugo ChÃ¡vez.
We asked residents of the city to describe what their living situation is like these days, and if it is a factor driving them to take part in the demonstrations.
"We are starving here."
Auristela Donawa, 67
The government benefits that Mrs. Donawa and her family have long relied on -- like many of those from poor neighborhoods of Caracas -- are no longer enough.
"We are starving here," she said, describing how she and her son Dixon Bront are struggling to provide for her grandchildren. "He has a 9-year-old daughter and a 17-year-old boy, and he can't buy anything for them. This is becoming impossible."
Mrs. Donawa never voted for Mr. Maduro or Mr. ChÃ¡vez, but her son was a supporter of the socialist government.
"I don't know if he voted for ChÃ¡vez, but he sympathized with him," she said.
Mr. Bront and Mrs. Donawa are beneficiaries of several government programs like MisiÃ³n Vivienda, which provides housing for the poor, and a food distribution program known as "CLAP."
But Mrs. Donawa said the government food box is often limited to sugar, pasta and powdered milk. As benefits have deteriorated, Mr. Bront, once a supporter of the government, decided to join the protesters calling for its demise.
Two weeks ago, he was injured during demonstrations -- shot in the stomach at close range by security forces -- and is now bedridden after two surgeries, putting a further strain on the family.
"I can't be here in a hospital, sleeping in a chair," Mrs. Donawa said from her son's bedside. "It's not that I do not agree with him protesting, he is doing it like any other Venezuelan that is unhappy with this communist government."
Her son has leukemia, but his hospital has no medicine.
Lourdes CedeÃ±o, 41
"It is like the world opens in half and you just want to jump into the crack," said Mrs. CedeÃ±o, describing how she felt six years ago when she first found out her son, Miguel, had leukemia.
Things were still manageable then. Her son was moved from a private hospital to the public Central Hospital of Venezuela where he was given medical treatment paid for by the state.
He went into remission for years, but in 2017, Miguel's cancer returned. That's when, Mrs. CedeÃ±o said, everything changed. It was a race against time to get him proper treatment.
"I had to buy everything," she said. "The chemotherapy, the antibiotics, the needles. But now it's even worse. I have to buy gloves, cotton, alcohol, water, even the tubes for the lab if I need to ask for a blood test."
Venezuela's main hospital has become a symbol of the catastrophic unraveling of the country's health care system. It is often without running water, medicine and even doctors. The electricity regularly cuts out, which has resulted in patient deaths, opposition politicians say.
Mrs. CedeÃ±o said she has never been a fan of the protests, but her son has told her he is eager to attend them.
"He said, 'Mom, I want to go out and make them feel the rage I feel everyday I am at this hospital without any help,"' she said.
"I have faith and hope."
Sunny Balza, 35
Mr. Balza, 35, was a captain in the Venezuelan National Guard and quickly moved up the ranks, gaining the trust of officials who grew to rely on him, including NicolÃ¡s Maduro Guerra, President Maduro's son. But he didn't always support the decisions of his superiors.
"I never agreed with their lines, ever," he said.
Two years ago, he fled Venezuela for the United States, where he now manages a company. Mr. GuaidÃ³, as interim president, has proposed amnesty for members of the armed forces who are willing to break with Mr. Maduro's government, but Mr. Barza is unsure whether he will return.
"I worked from the inside against the government," Mr. Barza said, adding that he didn't necessarily think he needed to ask for amnesty. While he would like to get involved with some of the protests being held in the United States, he doesn't have time with his busy work schedule. But for the first time in years, he sees a way forward for his country.
"I have faith and hope," he said.
She was detained for 118 days in a windowless room.
Lisbeth AÃ±ez, 52
Mrs. AÃ±ez knows what the government's crackdown on dissent looks like. She was arrested in May 2017, accused of involvement with groups organizing daily anti-government protests.
"I gave them food, I offered them shelter," she said. "That is why they call me mamÃ¡."
For 118 days, she was held in a windowless room with another woman accused of gas smuggling. After the protests ended that year, Mrs. AÃ±ez couldn't go back to her old life, saying being in jail had changed her.
"I can only tell you I am a better person now, and that I also knew true evil," she said.
Since the latest round of protests began last month, Mrs. AÃ±ez has scavenged for supplies for those wounded by the military and security forces. She has treated at least three protesters so far who were injured during recent demonstrations.
Mrs. AÃ±ez said earlier protests in 2014 and 2017 were too violent and not effective.
"Protests have to be like the one we had on the 23rd," she said, referring to largely peaceful mass anti-government protests held the day Mr. GuaidÃ³ swore himself in as interim president, "the kind that you can't hide."
"I will be out there with my gas mask."
IÃ±aki Zugasti, 60
Born in Spain but raised in Venezuela, Mr. Zugasti has been active in the opposition protest movement since Mr. Maduro first came to power in 2013. He plans to join the large demonstrations planned this weekend.
"This Saturday, I will be out there with my gas mask, my helmet and vest, to see what I can show the world," he said.
Mr. Zugasti owned a family printing company for two decades, which enabled him to provide for his family. But profits dwindled, and in 2018, he closed the business.
He said new people from different walks of life have been joining the recent protests. Before, he said, the movement was largely driven by the middle and upper classes.
"I used to see the same face every day, now it's different," he said.
Mr. Zugasti takes his camera with him when he protests, and took one especially memorable photo on April 4, 2017, of a young congressman confronting police who were blocking a march on Libertador Avenue.
He didn't know it then but the politician in the photo was Mr. GuaidÃ³, who would become a major player in the country's current political standoff.
"Every time I hear that he is someone that just started in politics, I know it's not true," Mr. Zugasti said. "He was always on the front line during protests. I remember him at every demonstration I went to."

Full text: Add the recent government shutdown to the list of things that didn't slow the American job market.
Over the past eight years, the American economy has endured trade tensions, debt-limit standoffs, foreign-policy crises and all manner of natural disasters. Through it all, companies kept on hiring.
The resilience continued in January as employers shrugged off both the monthlong shutdown and fears of an economic slowdown to add 304,000 jobs, far more than forecasters had anticipated. The report from the Labor Department marked the 100th consecutive month of job gains, more than double the previous record.
"This jobs report is showing no evidence of an economy slowing, certainly not falling into recession," said Michelle Meyer, chief United States economist for Bank of America Merrill Lynch. "It's still a tight labor market. Employers are still actively looking for jobs, and with wages ticking up, it looks like workers are getting some more bargaining power."
Friday's report does not mean the economy escaped the shutdown unscathed. The Congressional Budget Office this week estimated that the funding lapse shaved $11 billion off total output, $3 billion of which will never be recovered. Those totals don't include indirect costs from permits not issued, loans not processed and flights not taken because of delays at airports.
The effects on spending, investment and output should show up in other government reports, some of which were themselves delayed by the shutdown.
Those disruptions didn't deter employers, however. The unemployment rate rose slightly, to 4 percent, at least partly because of the idling of hundreds of thousands of federal workers. But hiring in the private sector was strong and broad-based, with manufacturers, retailers and construction companies all adding jobs. Wage growth, which has picked up in recent months after years of sluggish gains, remained solid, and the strong labor market continued to pull in workers from the sidelines.
The Labor Department did revise downward its estimate of December hiring by 90,000 jobs, an unusually large adjustment. But the strong growth in January, combined with upward revisions to earlier months, meant that the pace of hiring, averaged over six months, actually rose.
That combination of strong hiring and modest wage gains has put the economy on a strong, sustainable footing. More jobs means more income for consumers, which leads to more spending, and in turn more hiring.
"The virtuous cycle continues," said Michael Gapen, chief United States economist for Barclays. "What's kept this recovery going, what's kept the U.S. economy so resilient to all the things that have clouded the outlook, is a virtuous cycle of a continuously growing U.S. labor market."
None of the threats to the economy over the past several years have disrupted that central pattern. The shutdown, for example, caused ripple effects throughout the private sector, but companies and businesses also found ways to cope. Ben Herzon, an economist for Macroeconomic Advisers, a forecasting firm, said that as a result, the shutdown's economic impact might be more muted than simple economic models might suggest.
"The economy is resilient," Mr. Herzon said. "People and businesses find a way to work around these disruptions. People want to buy stuff, and businesses want to find a way to make that happen."
James Diana and his wife started JD's Canine Cruiser, a dog-walking and pet-sitting business in the Virginia suburbs of Washington, in 2012. The area's strong economy has allowed them to expand the business and bring on more contract employees, many of whom are at-home parents and others who might not find work in a less robust economy.
Many of Mr. Diana's customers are federal employees or contractors, and the shutdown hit his business hard. He said cancellations in January were roughly double their normal level, costing him thousands of dollars in lost business. Government workers, he noted, will get back pay, but that won't help him.
"That actually is lost income for us," he said. "They're going to get their money back. I'm not going to get my money back."
Mr. Diana said he pared his own spending, but he also tried to fill in the gap in his business. He doubled down on efforts to find new customers, including on Thumbtack, an online marketplace for hiring people to complete tasks.
"It forced me to go out there and get more clients," he said -- to "really get out there and start cranking."
A Hidden Shutdown?
The relative invisibility of the shutdown in Friday's data wasn't a total surprise. Because federal workers will receive back pay, the figures counted all of them as having been on payrolls in January, even if they weren't actually on the job.
Government contractors generally won't receive back pay, so if they didn't work, they weren't counted. Ditto for other private-sector workers who were laid off (or weren't hired) because of the shutdown. But most economists expected those effects to be small in an economy that employs more than 150 million people. Sure enough, private employers added nearly 300,000 jobs last month.
The shutdown does help explain why the unemployment rate ticked up in January. Unlike the monthly hiring figures, which come from a survey of employers and are based on their payrolls, the unemployment rate is based on a survey of households. In that survey, 175,000 more people than in December reported themselves as being unemployed because of a "temporary layoff" -- a total that included government workers.
"Where's your shutdown impact? There it is," said Brett Ryan, an economist for Deutsche Bank in New York. "It just showed up in the unemployment rate."
Cautious, but Still Hiring
Economists have become increasingly concerned in recent months about a range of possible threats to the United States economy. Growth has slowed in Europe and China; trade tensions are threatening the American manufacturing sector; stock market jitters could make consumers less likely to spend; and the shutdown, of course, could erode confidence among consumers and businesses.
None of that, however, has yet affected the job market.
"There's a caution or concern in people's voices, but it hasn't turned into action," said Teresa Carroll, executive vice president for Kelly Services, a staffing firm. "Anybody in a hiring situation in a company is probably waiting for that next shoe to drop, but it doesn't mean they're stopping."
It isn't just Friday's data that looked strong. Claims for unemployment insurance recently hit a nearly 50-year low. Paychecks are growing -- data released Thursday showed that wages and salaries rose 3.1 percent in the final three months of 2018 compared with a year earlier, the fastest growth since the recession ended a decade ago. And employers report in private surveys that they plan to keep on adding workers, at least if they can find them.
"The underlying foundation hasn't changed," said Becky Frankiewicz, president of ManpowerGroup North America, a staffing firm. She said what she was hearing from clients was "nice, robust optimism continuing around hiring."
As the unemployment rate has fallen, companies have had to work harder to find workers. Ms. Frankiewicz said companies were increasingly offering training, rethinking job requirements and letting employees work remotely.
They are also raising pay -- a factor that may be attracting people who had previously stopped looking for work. The labor force grew by nearly half a million people in January, suggesting that more Americans are willing and able to work than the low unemployment rate might indicate.
"If wages are rising, that gives a greater incentive for folks to come back into the labor force and look for jobs," Ms. Meyer of Bank of America Merrill Lynch said.
More Complications for Policymakers
The Federal Reserve had signaled this week that it was pressing "pause" on plans to continue raising interest rates this year. Jerome H. Powell, the Fed's chairman, said that "the case for raising rates has weakened somewhat" because of low inflation and slowing global growth.
Friday's report seemed to offer a sharp counterpoint to those comments. The economy, at least in the United States, still seems strong, and wage growth has been picking up.
Still, economists said the report was unlikely to lead the Fed to reverse course yet again.
"This is just one piece of news," Mr. Ryan of Deutsche Bank said. "They're going to have to see several more of these before they're comfortable hiking again."
For President Trump, whose approval ratings have been battered by the shutdown, the Russia investigation and other factors, Friday's data was welcome news. Both Mr. Trump's re-election campaign and the White House issued news releases highlighting the jobs figures, and the president hailed the report on Twitter.

Taxing the Rich Sounds Easy. But It's Not.

Full text: Taxing the wealthiest Americans at a higher rate may be good politics, since most voters won't be affected. But while two recent proposals sound simple enough, they could be difficult to put into effect.
And if the experience with the alternative minimum tax is any guide, using tax policy to target one group can backfire.
One tax proposal comes from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a new Democratic congresswoman from New York who has said that an increase in income taxes could help fund other initiatives, like work on climate change. She said in an interview on "60 Minutes" that the rate on earnings over $10 million could be 60 or 70 percent, up from the current rate of 37 percent. This tax, on what she called the "tippy tops" of earners, would be graduated like the rest of the income code, so only a portion of the millionaires' income would be taxed at that high rate.
And Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat preparing for a presidential campaign, has proposed a wealth tax of 2 percent on people with a net worth above $50 million and 3 percent on those with a net worth over $1 billion.
Ms. Warren worked with Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, two respected economists at the University of California, Berkeley, whose research focuses on income inequality. They estimated that such a tax would raise $2.75 trillion over 10 years, which sounds like a lot but would account for just 1 percent of gross domestic product.
The devil, though, is in the details.
Such targeted tax policies have often been riddled with loopholes, as was the case with the highest marginal tax rates in the 1970s; become overly complex to enact, like the alternative minimum tax; or created unintended consequences that affected taxpayers beyond those originally intended.
Ms. Warren's wealth tax, for example, has three major challenges.
First, there is a huge gap in wealth between $50 million and $1 billion. There are far more people with wealth in the tens and hundreds of millions of dollars in the United States -- 39,735, according to Wealth-X, which tracks wealth in the world -- than there are billionaires -- 680 -- who would pay the higher 3 percent tax.
If raising revenue is the object, increasing the tax rate for people at several intervals between $50 million and $1 billion, which are very different levels of wealth, would bring in more revenue, wealth experts said.
As it stands, billionaires would contribute just $300 billion of the $2.75 trillion the higher rates are projected to raise over 10 years. Adding in rates would also allow Ms. Warren to increase the rate again for billionaires.
A bigger issue is that a wealth tax may not be constitutional. The 16th Amendment provides only for an income tax. The estate, gift and generation-skipping taxes pass muster because they're deemed excise taxes on the transfer of wealth, not on the wealth itself.
"Senator Warren's proposal is based on a study by two scholars, and she's pursuing that," said Joanne Johnson, head of wealth advisory group at J. P. Morgan's private bank. "There is a lot of extremely important analysis that still has to occur."
A third issue is logistical. A wealth tax would be like an estate tax levied every year. Figuring out the tax owed on large estates is complicated, costly and time-consuming. The Internal Revenue Service gives estates a year to file a return, but even then, executors often have to file extensions. And on the other end, auditors go through the returns, which can take years before an estate is settled.
The process requires not just lawyers and accountants but valuation experts who assess the worth of assets like closely held family businesses.
"It would be a highly cumbersome tax return to prepare on an annual basis," said Jeff Moes, executive vice president and chief fiduciary officer at FineMark National Bank & Trust, which serves high-net-worth clients. "Every federal estate tax goes through an audit, and presumably this would go through an audit as well. They'd have to figure out if the valuation methodology is correct."
"A billionaire would have a return that would be literally three feet high," he added. "Our $100 million clients own multiple closely held businesses. All of them would require an expert valuation and five-year financials."
And then the government would need to have enough auditors to verify everything that was submitted. In 2018, for example, an estimated 4,000 estate tax returns will be filed, with tax owed on 1,900 of them. That's a tenth the number of tax returns that would be filed under Ms. Warren's wealth tax plan.
As for Ms. Ocasio-Cortez's idea, many economists have noted that a rate of 70 percent for the highest tax bracket has been in place before. But the tax environment in the 1970s was different from today's. (That top marginal kicked in at $200,000, or roughly $800,000 in today's dollars.)
Back then, people could average their income over several years to reduce the large tax bite. There were also far more deductions that people could take than there are now.
Maury Cartine, a partner at the accounting firm Marcum and a certified public accountant for 50 years, said that when the highest tax bracket was 70 percent in the 1970s, the tax on earned income -- as opposed to investment income -- was limited to 50 percent. At that time, an individual taxpayer could also deduct interest on any type of loan -- car, educational, credit card -- and not just on a home.
"A taxpayer could refinance appreciated rental property, take the proceeds to buy a yacht or some very nice jewelry and still deduct the interest," Mr. Cartine said.
These deductions have been whittled away over the years. And in the current tax code, even deductions like those on state and local taxes or mortgage interest have been eliminated or curtailed. In other words, a 70 percent rate would be a much higher rate today, given the limited deductions, than it was in the 1970s.
It's also worth looking back at the unintended consequences from similar policy-driven tax proposals.
The alternative minimum tax was started in a different form in 1969. It was largely meant to target the 155 Americans who had incomes over $200,000 (roughly more than $1 million today) and hadn't paid any income tax. It was reformulated in 1982 but never indexed to inflation.
So as incomes rose, more and more affluent people were hit by the tax, which reduced deductions and set a minimum tax rate of 26 and 28 percent. Affluent professionals living in areas with high property and state taxes that could be deducted, like the Northeast, were often subject to it.
Timothy Speiss, partner in charge of the personal wealth advisers group at EisnerAmper, an accounting firm, said that by 2017, the alternative minimum tax had affected more affluent people than the truly wealthy.
The Tax Policy Center noted that 27 percent of people earning $200,000 to $500,000 and 62 percent of people earning $500,000 to $1 million paid more in taxes in 2017 because of the tax, while only 20 percent of people earning more than $1 million paid higher taxes.
A simpler example of unintended consequences is what's called the loss carry-forward provision. It allows people to deduct up to $3,000 a year in investment losses against their ordinary income. Yet that $3,000 was set in 1978, when it was worth significantly more and fewer people were broadly invested in financial markets through their retirement plans. It hasn't been adjusted in 40 years.
"Any parameter that is not indexed to inflation automatically creates unintended consequences as more people become subject to it," said Gil Charney, director of the Tax Institute at H & R Block. "It's also another example of the marriage penalty. It's $3,000 per return, not per person."
Late this past week, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a potential Democratic presidential candidate, took a different tack in taxing the rich. He proposed applying an estate tax with a top rate of 77 percent for estates exceeding $1 billion.
How Senator Warren's or Representative Ocasio-Cortez's proposal would work rests as much on proper execution as on the definition of wealthy.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- President Trump in 2018 repeatedly urged the Federal Reserve to stop raising interest rates, warning that its "crazy" policies were jeopardizing the economic expansion.
This week, the Fed stopped. The central bank did not raise its benchmark rate at its first meeting of 2019, and said it had no plans to raise rates in the foreseeable future.
The Fed's newfound patience delighted the White House, and Wall Street. It was seen as a concession to the Fed's critics, and as a boost for an economic expansion that is on the verge of becoming the longest in the nation's modern history.
"We have, by far, the strongest economy in the world!" Mr. Trump exulted Friday morning on Twitter.
But the details of the Fed's decision suggest less cause for celebration.
Jerome H. Powell, the Fed's chairman, said Wednesday that the Fed was pausing not because it embraced Mr. Trump's argument that the economy was in ruddy health, but because the expansion faced growing threats, including from the impact of Mr. Trump's own policies.
Among these, Mr. Powell listed the trade war with China and the risk of another government shutdown.
In effect, the Fed concluded the expansion might not survive the combination of more rate increases and Mr. Trump's economic policies, so it pulled off the road to reduce the risk of a crash.
For the moment, of course, there is little practical difference between the White House view that rates should stay low because the economy is strong and the Fed view that rates should remain low because the economy is fragile. The tension will resume if growth revives.
The Fed's shift also stopped well short of the president's stated preferences.
The central bank still raised rates four times in 2018, in the face of Mr. Trump's warnings, and Mr. Powell said Wednesday that he thought those increases were warranted. Friday's report that the economy added 304,000 jobs in January suggests that the Fed hasn't yet choked the economy.
The Fed similarly stopped short of accepting Mr. Trump's advice that it should "stop with the 50Bs," referring to its policy of reducing its bond portfolio by about $50 billion each month.
While saying it would continue reducing its holdings for now, the Fed was at pains to reassure investors that it stands ready to adjust the policy as necessary and that it is likely to stop sooner than previously expected.
Mr. Trump picked Mr. Powell to serve as the Fed's chairman. But last year, as interest rates rose and the stock market declined, the president repeatedly attacked Fed policy as "crazy," "wild" and "loco." He fretted to aides that Mr. Powell would "turn me into Hoover," a reference to the president during the early years of the Great Depression, and he asked aides whether he could replace the chairman.
Mr. Trump's attacks on the Fed are not easily assembled into a coherent critique. But some lieutenants have advanced the argument that the administration's economic policies are expanding the labor force and increasing productivity, resulting in economic growth without inflation.
In this view, the Fed should leave interest rates at a low level to allow the expansion to continue.
"My hope is that the Fed, under its new management, understands that more people working and faster economic growth do not cause inflation," Larry Kudlow, the head of the National Economic Council, said last year. He added that the Fed should increase interest rates "very slowly."
Administration officials also blamed the Fed's policies for causing the wobbles in financial markets last year.
Mr. Powell, by contrast, said on Wednesday that the economic outlook was deteriorating for reasons unrelated to the Fed's policies. He pointed to storm clouds including economic weakness in China and Europe and tightening financial conditions, as well as the impact of Mr. Trump's policies.
He made the nuanced point that the Fed still regards solid economic growth as the most likely outcome for the coming year but that result is now somewhat less likely.
"At such times, common-sense risk management suggests patiently awaiting greater clarity," he said.
The persistent sluggishness of inflation, which has remained below the Fed's preferred 2 percent annual pace since the 2008 crisis, also played a role. Mr. Powell said the Fed had the luxury of being patient because the risk of higher inflation "appears to have diminished."
"It seems to me that what's happened is the Fed is saying, 'We're more concerned now about the secular stagnation issues than inflation at this moment,"' said Lewis Alexander, the chief United States economist at Nomura. "And I think to be perfectly frank that's a perfectly reasonable place for them to be."
Analysts said the negative reaction of financial markets after the Fed's previous meeting, in December, was a particularly important factor. The Fed raised rates and predicted two more increases in 2019. Mr. Powell also emphasized the Fed's commitment to reducing bond holdings, which some investors saw as overly aggressive.
"They were planning on roaring forward with this balance sheet roll-off, and the market is like: 'Oh, my God! That will crush the economy!"' said Julia Coronado, a former Fed economist and the president of MacroPolicy Perspectives. "And so they recalibrated. Good."
Mohamed A. El-Erian, chief economic adviser at the financial firm Allianz, said the Fed's decision Wednesday "came as absolutely no surprise." Since the global financial crisis, he said, the Fed has backed down each time investors objected to the tightening of monetary policy.
Among those moments: the 2013 "taper tantrum" and the decision to postpone rate increases in 2016.
"It's watching the same movie over and over again," he said.
The question, Mr. El-Erian said, is whether the Fed should be listening to the markets.
"If you believe that the market is signaling something genuine about the economy that the Fed has not yet understood, then it's not a bad thing," he said. "If, however, you believe that the market has gotten used to having the Fed as its rich uncle, then this is a bad thing."
Some Fed officials appear more receptive to the kind of arguments advanced by Mr. Kudlow, notably Richard Clarida, who became the Fed's vice chairman in September and said in a November speech that he saw some signs of a stronger trend in productivity growth.
Other Fed officials said last summer, when there were fewer risks to the economic outlook, that the central bank should keep raising rates into restrictive territory to slow what they saw as unsustainable growth.
Mr. Powell has sought to push the question into the future, suggesting he is open to either possibility. He has said the Fed will not respond to wage growth as a sufficient sign of inflationary pressure. Similarly, he said Wednesday that evidence of inflation would be a "big part" of any case for more rate increases.
The problem for Mr. Powell is that monetary policy exerts a gradual influence on economic conditions, meaning that policymakers must calibrate policy based on forecasts.
Sooner or later, Mr. Powell will need to decide what he thinks about Trumponomics.

Full text: BIRMINGHAM, England -- On a foggy afternoon last fall, a suicidal patient walked out of Solihull Hospital and disappeared. Alerted by hospital staff, police officers discovered her on a Birmingham street, having downed a bottle of vodka.
They took her to their station house, waited for her to sober up and called social service agencies and charities for help. Their calls were rebuffed or never answered.
At midnight, Constable Richard Chant finally persuaded the woman to go to a different hospital, but it was a Pyrrhic victory. In the eight hours that officers worked on her case, the West Midlands Police Department received 1,452 other emergency calls, and in many of those cases, hours or days went by before an officer responded.
"It was a bit of checkmate," Constable Chant said. "We need to support these people in crisis, but the police are not the right ones to be dealing with them."
Constable Chant's burden reflects the strained state of policing in Britain's era of economic austerity: The number and range of emergency calls has risen sharply in Birmingham and in many other cities, but there are now far fewer officers to respond. The economic uncertainties around Britain's withdrawal from the European Union mean that budget pressures could be far from over.
The West Midlands Police has seen $220 million in budget cuts since the Conservative-led government's austerity program began in 2010. The department has slashed a quarter of its officers, leaving numbers nearly as low as when the force was formed in 1974. Across England and Wales, police staffing has fallen by about 20,000 officers.
The problem is compounded by parallel cuts to social services. Addiction services, housing benefits, gang mediation programs and social services for both adults and children have all been pared back, creating metastasizing problems that often fall to the police.
There are also questions about whether the cuts are contributing to a spike in violent crime. Murders and robberies, while not near American crime rates, have surged to their highest levels in a decade in England and Wales. Knife offenses rose in 2018 for the fourth straight year, and crimes involving firearms dipped after rising for several years.
Since the mid-1990s, Britain has registered a marked decline in violent crime, national crime surveys show, and it is too soon to know if the recent uptick is an anomaly or a trend. But much of the recent debate has focused nonetheless on the impact of austerity -- particularly on how crime calls are going unanswered as officers work to plug holes in the country's safety net.
"If you're putting your faith in the police to sort out these problems, you're really firing a sort of pea shooter at something that's a cannon-sized problem," said Richard Garside, the director of the Center for Crime and Justice Studies in London.
Hours devoted to health and welfare calls leave less time to collect evidence and solve crimes. As a result, victims who are not in immediate danger routinely wait days for a police interview. Officers say they have essentially given up investigating property crimes, dropping burglary complaints unless the homeowners can find a fingerprint or provide surveillance video.
Police spending ballooned in the early 2000s under a Labour government, which gave officers a broad charge to clamp down on small-scale misbehavior and impose order in accordance with the "broken windows" theory of policing that was then much in vogue. No longer.
"It was all right, the police being the jack-of-all-trades, when there was a necessary amount of funding for the police," Constable Chant said. "But if you've got 20,000 less police officers, less funding, then somebody needs to make the decision about what they want us to do."
A Tattered Safety Net
Two hours north of London by train, the West Midlands contains former factory towns and cities that were once the industrial heart of England. It is now among the poorest regions in Britain.
Last summer, as the West Midlands Police confronted a backlog of more than 2,000 unanswered complaints, the department's leader, Chief Constable Dave Thompson, went on patrol. One woman had filed a complaint about her brother slashing her tires but was more worried about his mental health than the vandalism.
"They'd tried the doctor and got nothing; they'd tried a community mental health team and they got nothing," Chief Constable Thompson said. "I can't solve this for them, but increasingly, we see calls coming through to the police like that because we're here 24 hours a day."
On a different afternoon, Inspector Lucy Bird fielded emergency calls in the West Midlands Police dispatch room, her radio crackling with what she called "mispers," police slang for reports of missing people, many of them mentally ill.
One call involved a mentally ill woman who had stolen lighter fluid and was threatening to burn down a grocery store and set herself on fire. Another call about a man who had gone missing before getting his psychiatric medication set off an intense police search.
"A good proportion of our jobs on a daily basis are mental health," Inspector Bird said.
In recent decades, the rate of diagnoses of severe mental illness has climbed in England while services have been reduced. In turn, officers in England and Wales detained 60 percent more people for psychiatric reasons in 2015-16 than they did a decade earlier. The police in London now receive a call related to mental illness about once every four minutes.
Prime Minister Theresa May has said that health care has been protected from austerity cuts. But mental health trusts were given $134 million less to spend on patient care in 2017, accounting for inflation, compared with five years earlier, the Royal College of Psychiatrists reported. And last year, the Care Quality Commission, a health care regulator, concluded that more than a third of mental health trusts in England were rated as needing to improve patient safety.
Since the 1980s, tens of thousands of psychiatric beds have been cut, initially as part of a policy shift to caring for the mentally ill in the community rather than in hospitals. Under austerity, those reductions have continued.
In November, a government inspector found that "other organizations rely on the police to effectively 'pick up the pieces' after they have gone off duty." Even small cuts in social services can mean heavier workloads for police officers.
Michael Brown, an inspector in the West Midlands force, is now assigned to study mental health for the national College of Policing. The mental health crisis team in his old patrol area once had two nurses who responded to calls from people who said they were unwell.
By 2014, Inspector Brown said, the team had been halved, and government policy prohibited the nurse who remained from making calls alone for safety reasons.
Many of those calls were rerouted to the police.
An Increase in Homicides
Inside a police station that closed to the public three years ago, Inspector Warren Hines, a homicide detective, was confronted with a resource crisis. There were more than 50 homicides last year in the West Midlands, roughly twice as many as in 2014, yet he has fewer investigators than ever. Robberies or assaults are supposed to get attention within an hour if the offender has left, yet they can go unanswered for days.
On the streets, officers are racing between emergency calls and have less time to patrol a beat. Regular patrols may do little to deter crime, but Inspector Hines said they often provided intelligence essential to his investigations. Officers who used to wait in hot spots for drug dealing or violence now spend more time answering calls.
"There was a time when we'd have a pretty good idea of who would be dealing drugs, we'd have a pretty good idea where a lot of the stolen property was being disposed of," said Inspector Hines, who is also a representative of West Midlands Police Federation, which advocates for officers. "And now we just don't know."
At the end of May, Inspector Hines was canvassing for witnesses to the killing of a 15-year-old boy. He came upon a taxi driver who, if not likely to be a crucial witness, still could have helped describe the scene. But the man declined to help, saying the police had failed to help him after he reported three robberies.
"He said, 'I don't really see it's my job to help you,"' Inspector Hines said.
Part of what has slowed response times has been the closing of local police stations and the consolidation of response teams that began in the early years of austerity. Only 10 stations in the West Midlands now have a public counter, down from 48 in 2010, and 14 local stations have been shut completely.
Sgt. Richard Cooke, the chairman of the West Midlands Police Federation, remembered an assault case in Walsall, an industrial town northwest of Birmingham. A woman called the emergency number to say that her son, who had a history of drug abuse, was trying to kick in her door.
The nearest officers were in Wolverhampton, about 10 miles away. By the time they arrived, the woman had been attacked and her son had fled.
"That's happening on a regular basis," Sergeant Cooke said.
'Their Gang Is Bigger Than Our Gang'
For many police departments, as well as for Britain's still influential tabloids, the answer to the deteriorating service seems simple: more officers. Patterns of taxi robberies and home break-ins are being missed because so many cases are shelved without so much as a cursory investigation, they say. Victims stop calling the police. Criminals are emboldened.
"When the criminals realize that their gang is bigger than our gang," Constable Chant said, "they start exploiting that."
Much of the blame has fallen on Mrs. May, the architect of the cuts as home secretary from 2010 to 2016. Even as she negotiates Britain's tortured withdrawal from the European Union, she faces the daily ire of officers who have not forgiven her for past crackdowns on corruption in officer associations and on stop-and-frisk tactics, or for the personnel cutbacks.
"We think she's got it in for us," Sergeant Cooke said.
But others say Britain should restore funding for social services rather than expand police forces that are poorly equipped to address a mental health crisis.
In mid-December, Mrs. May's government announced an additional $1.2 billion for the police. Police leaders were quick to lament that much of it would be absorbed by the forces' growing pension obligations, rather than adding more officers.
Kirk Dawes, a former West Midlands police officer, retired from the force and started a mediation program for Birmingham, the site of vicious feuds between gangs like the Burger Bar Boys and Johnson Crew.
Having studied gang mediation tactics in New Jersey and in Northern Ireland, he took referrals from the police when someone was attacked or when investigators caught wind of a threat to someone's life.
With roughly 100 cases a year in the early 2000s, the mediation team had only one person killed on its watch. The team had an annual budget of roughly $440,000, and Mr. Dawes figures it saved the government millions of dollars in costly homicide investigations. But under austerity, the program's budget was sharply reduced, until it folded in 2012.
By last fall, more than a third of the homicides being investigated by West Midlands detectives were the sort of killings that Mr. Dawes's team might once have worked to prevent.
"All of that was lost," he said.

Full text: CARACAS, Venezuela -- The agents barged into the home of Yonaiker OrdÃ³Ã±ez, 18, on Sunday morning as he slept. Dressed in helmets and carrying rifles, the men grabbed the teenager and forced him to another room without explaining why they came, his family said.
"They took him to the area behind and killed him there," said his sister, Yengly GonzÃ¡lez.
The operation resembled one of the many police raids against the gangs that terrorize Venezuela's poor neighborhoods. But Mr. OrdÃ³Ã±ez's only crime, his family said, was that he attended a protest against the government days before.
President NicolÃ¡s Maduro is facing the biggest challenge to his authoritarian rule yet. Protesters are in the streets, an opposition lawmaker has declared himself the rightful president, a growing number of foreign governments have backed that claim and the Trump administration has intensified the pressure, cutting off Mr. Maduro's access to oil sales in the United States -- a principal source of his government's cash.
In the face of the crisis, Mr. Maduro has hit back hard, sending out security forces to crush dissent in deadly operations that have alarmed even some of the president's traditional supporters.
But while Venezuela's armed forces have publicly declared their allegiance to Mr. Maduro, they have not taken the muscular role they have in the past. When months of chaotic demonstrations arose against Mr. Maduro two years ago, it was largely the National Guard that squelched dissent with batons and bullets, with protesters prosecuted in military courts.
But this time, in a potential sign of the strained loyalties inside the military, much of the crackdown has been entrusted to a relatively new national police unit that Mr. Maduro created to conduct raids on gang groups in Venezuela's slums.
Now the unit appears to have his political opponents in its sights. Known as the Special Actions Force, or FAES, it is being sent to work as Mr. Maduro's enforcer in the poor neighborhoods that once supported him but have turned against him, according to human rights groups, former government officials and current lawmakers.
At least 40 people have been killed in the latest round of protests against Mr. Maduro, largely in nightly raids in poor neighborhoods involving the special police unit, human rights groups say.
"FAES has become deeply involved in acts of repression," said Delsa SolÃ³rzano, a lawmaker in the opposition-led National Assembly who met with recent victims of the raids.
The involvement of the special police unit is especially worrisome, human rights advocates say, because the unit was created to put down armed gangs or rescue hostages, not to control crowds of protesters in a peaceful manner.
"The consequence when they go in is massacres," said Keymer Ãvila, an investigator with Provea, a Venezuelan human rights organization. "They weren't made to handle demonstrations."
But Cliver AlcalÃ¡, a former military general who broke ranks with Mr. Maduro, said it was not surprising that the government was relying on the special police unit to do its bidding. The reason: It has lost trust in many members of the armed forces to confront protesters the way they did in 2017.
Many of the National Guardsmen who were sent to the streets in previous years have not returned to work because their salaries are nearly worthless, Mr. AlcalÃ¡ said. Venezuela's inflation -- the worst in the world -- has obliterated them.
Beyond that, he said, the government is afraid of uprisings or public shows of defiance by members of the armed forces, including the one last week, when members of the National Guard were arrested after pledging allegiance to the opposition. Other small uprisings have taken place before being put down.
Human rights groups say little is known about Mr. Maduro's special police force, including the names of its top commanders and who exactly has been invited to form its ranks.
The unit patrols Venezuela dressed in black, with the identities of its members concealed by balaclavas covering their faces. A former Venezuelan government official, who asked not to be named because he is being pursued by the government, estimated its ranks to be about 1,500 people. They're seen in Caracas on the backs of motorcycles in order to penetrate hillside slums, where they arrive heavily armed with assault rifles and body armor.
"Their faces are covered because they want impunity," said Luis Izquiel, a criminologist in Caracas who teaches at the Central University of Venezuela. "They know they're violating human rights."
The group came into existence in 2017 as Mr. Maduro struggled to wrest control of the country's poor neighborhoods from criminal gangs.
The government had been organizing joint raids with the police and armed forces, called Operation Liberate the People, which became increasingly bloody. In a single two-year period, the government said the raids killed more than 500 people.
Facing mounting opposition to the raids, Mr. Maduro changed course, creating the special unit of his national police charged with a similar task.
The new police are taught to be loyal to the president, training at Venezuela's National Experimental Security University, an institution founded under Mr. Maduro's predecessor, Hugo ChÃ¡vez.
Mr. Izquiel, the criminologist, said that officers leave after only six months training that is largely conducted by ideologically driven professors who preach allegiance to Mr. Maduro's government.
Even before the protests, the police unit had been involved in several high-profile crackdowns.
Among them was the killing of Ãscar PÃ©rez, a rogue police pilot who commandeered a helicopter and captured the attention of many Venezuelans in 2017 when he fired blank ammunition on government buildings and unfurled a banner calling for Venezuelans to rebel against Mr. Maduro.
For months, he continued to attack military bases and taunt the government on social media.
In an interview with The New York Times shortly before his death, Mr. PÃ©rez asserted that a pro-Maduro paramilitary group had penetrated the special police unit and exerted influence over it. It was an explosive assertion even then, because it meant that civilian vigilantes were acting as uniformed police officers.
The day of Mr. PÃ©rez's death, the leader of the paramilitary group, a man named Heiker VÃ¡squez, was killed fighting alongside FAES officials who had surrounded Mr. PÃ©rez.
Uniformed members of the special police unit were also photographed in Mr. VÃ¡squez's funeral procession along with members of his paramilitary group, known as the Three Roots. In Venezuela, these armed paramilitary groups are known as "colectivos," and typically have their roots in fervently pro-ChÃ¡vez circles.
"If it's not FAES in these raids, it's colectivos dressed in FAES uniforms," said Ms. SolÃ³rzano, the legislator, saying that she believes the pro-government groups are being armed and asked to fight alongside regular officers.
Julio Reyes, an opposition activist, said he was targeted on Sunday in the Tacagua Vieja neighborhood by the special police unit.
Just after he had gotten up and his wife began making coffee, he said he heard motorcycles revving in front of his house. Six masked men barged into his home, forced his family onto a couch and pointed a gun at his wife and him, he said. After a short period, they left.
"I said, 'Brother, lower your weapon,"' Mr. Reyes said. "'You're not talking to a criminal, you're talking to a father who works Monday through Saturday."'
Relatives of Mr. OrdÃ³Ã±ez, who was killed that day, said they never got a real explanation for his death.
His sister, Ms. GonzÃ¡lez, said she asked a FAES officer patrolling the area why the group had shot her brother. The officer said that Mr. OrdÃ³Ã±ez had been killed in a fight with the unit and had been trying to flee, she recalled.
But Ms. GonzÃ¡lez said the explanation made little sense because her brother had already been hit with rubber bullets fired by FAES officers during a protest several days ago, and was barely able to walk.
On Wednesday, at his funeral, Mr. OrdÃ³Ã±ez's body lay in a wooden coffin lined with butcher paper. Family members knelt beside it in the back of a pickup truck before it was lowered into a grave.
"The government obliges you to be what they want you to be," said Ms. GonzÃ¡lez. "Because if not, they will imprison you, or you're dead."

Full text: TEHRAN -- Iran, squeezed by punishing American sanctions, is confronting its most severe economic challenge in 40 years, President Hassan Rouhani said on Wednesday, arguing that the Iranian government "should not be blamed" for the crisis.
The Trump administration reimposed sanctions on Iran last year after President Trump decided to withdraw from the international nuclear accord reached with Tehran in 2015, calling it a "horrible one-sided deal." Under the pact, Iran agreed to essentially freeze its nuclear program for at least 15 years in exchange for relief from oil and financial sanctions.
Under American pressure, dozens of European companies have abandoned operations in Iran that they had started after the signing of the nuclear agreement, leaving thousands of Iranians jobless. Reimposed banking sanctions have sharply curtailed foreign investment and access to international credit, and oil sanctions have more than halved Iran's crude exports, its main source of income.
"Today the country is facing the biggest pressure and economic sanctions in the past 40 years," since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, Mr. Rouhani said in a speech commemorating the anniversary that was broadcast on state television.
Ordinary Iranians are feeling the pinch. There have been sporadic protests by laborers, retirees, truck drivers and teachers that have occasionally led to clashes with security forces. In a year, the national currency, the rial, has lost 70 percent of its value compared to the dollar. Inflation is over 35 percent.
Iranian state television has been reporting shortages and rationing of red meat in recent days, showing consumers complaining about prices that have risen by 75 percent in the last year, according to government statistics. Officials blame illegal exports of Iranian livestock to neighboring countries, as well as fluctuations in the exchange rate that have hampered imports from Brazil.
Mr. Trump said on Twitter on Wednesday that Iran's "economy is now crashing," arguing that the hardship "is the only thing holding" the country back from expanding its malign influence in the Middle East.
Iran's leaders put the blame squarely on the American sanctions for the economic strain. "Today our problems are primarily because of pressure from America and its followers," Mr. Rouhani said. "And the dutiful government and Islamic system should not be blamed."
Mr. Rouhani did not refer to corruption and mismanagement, two other factors that analysts have cited in Iran's economic free-fall. He instead said that the "people's resistance, efforts and sacrifices" would help Iran defeat the United States.

Taking Step Back, Fed Signals Pause In Rate Increases

Full text: WASHINGTON -- In suspending its previous plans to continue raising rates this year, the Federal Reserve signaled that its march toward higher interest rates may be ending sooner than expected.
The Fed's chairman, Jerome H. Powell, said economic growth remained "solid" and the central bank expected growth to continue. But in a sharp reversal of the Fed's stance just six week ago, Mr. Powell said the Fed had "the luxury of patience" in deciding whether to raise rates again.
"The case for raising rates has weakened somewhat," Mr. Powell said, pointing to sluggish inflation, slowing growth in Europe and China, and the possibility of another federal government shutdown.
"My colleagues and I have one overarching goal," Mr. Powell said at a news conference on Wednesday after a two-day meeting of the Fed's policymaking committee, "to sustain the economic expansion."
The Fed left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at its first meeting of 2019, a decision that was widely expected. What surprised markets was the indication that rates, which are in a range of 2.25 percent to 2.5 percent, may stay put for some time.
Investors expressed their enthusiasm around the globe early Thursday, as Asian markets followed Wall Street higher and left major markets in Japan and Hong Kong up about 1 percent by midday.
On Wednesday, the S&P 500-stock index climbed sharply after the Fed announcement and ended the day up 1.55 percent. Yields on shorter-term Treasury securities, which are heavily influenced by Fed policy, declined as investors concluded that any near-term interest rate increases were off the table.
The Fed's newfound caution is likely to delight President Trump, who argued loudly and publicly through much of 2018 that the Fed should stop raising its benchmark rate, which he said would snuff out the economic expansion. While the president did not address the Fed's decision directly, he wrote on Twitter: "Dow just broke 25,000. Tremendous news!"
Some on the other side of the political spectrum also supported the Fed's move, saying the slow pace of inflation allowed the Fed to refrain from raising rates, so that job and wage growth could continue.
Jared Bernstein, an economist at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, summarized the Fed's new policy stance as "Don't just do something, stand there!" He added that the new approach "seems right to me." Mr. Bernstein said domestic growth was under pressure from tighter financial conditions, the slowdown in global growth and what he called "Trumpian chaos."
"Tightening under these conditions would be unnecessary roughness," he said.
For the last several years, the Fed said consistently that it planned to keep raising interest rates. The pace was uncertain, but the direction was clear. Wednesday's statement omitted previous language indicating that "some further gradual increases" would be warranted. Instead, it said the Fed would be "patient" in evaluating the health of the economy. And it suggested the Fed stood ready either to raise or to cut rates, depending on economic conditions.
Reinforcing this more cautious tone, the Fed also announced in a separate statement that it was prepared to slow or even reverse the steady slimming of its bond portfolio. This, too, was a striking shift. The Fed said in December that it was committed to steadily reducing its holdings of Treasuries and mortgage bonds, which it amassed during the financial crisis to help bolster the economy.
The Fed's policymaking committee voted unanimously for the changes.
Fed officials had signaled the shift in their thinking in recent weeks, aligning on the theme of patience with unusual consistency, leaving little doubt of their intentions.
Still, the strength of the shift caught analysts and investors by surprise, particularly given Mr. Powell's more hawkish comments at the end of last year.
While the Fed is pausing for now, Mr. Powell said he believed the central bank had raised rates to an appropriate level and had not overtightened. "I think our policy stance today is appropriate for the state of the economy," he said. "That's my feeling."
Mr. Powell did not directly address how long the Fed planned to remain patient but suggested any future rate increases would depend largely on signs of inflation, which has consistently fallen below the Fed's 2 percent target.
"I would want to see a need for further rate increases, and for me a big part of that would be inflation," he said.
Brian Coulton, chief economist at Fitch Ratings, said he expected economic growth to continue and therefore he expected the Fed to resume rate increases this year. "This reads more like a pause than a strong signal that they believe that they are the end of the hiking cycle," Mr. Coulton said. "Barring a very significant global downturn, we still see further rate increases later this year."
Others, however, said the Fed may well have raised rates for the last time during the current economic expansion. "It does feel like the top of the cycle," said Tim Duy, an economist at the University of Oregon who follows the central bank closely. "With the economy poised to slow over the next year, the Fed is not interested in risking turning that slowdown into a recession."
The shift left some Fed watchers puzzling over why the central bank had reversed course so quickly.
In early October, Mr. Powell described the Fed's benchmark interest rate as "a long way from neutral." The comment was read by markets as implying that the Fed planned to continue raising rates for some time.
Mr. Powell sought to soften that impression in subsequent public appearances. After the Fed raised the benchmark rate by a quarter point at its December meeting, Mr. Powell said that the rate was at the lower end of what Fed officials consider the neutral zone: the region in which rates would neither stimulate nor restrain the economy. That implied the Fed was closer to pausing.
But Mr. Powell still said the Fed expected to keep raising its benchmark interest rate. And the Fed released projections showing most of its officials predicted at least two rate increases in 2019.
In his opening remarks on Wednesday, Mr. Powell said that the change in the Fed's plans did not reflect "a major shift in the baseline outlook for the economy." But he struggled to explain the Fed's reasoning, suggesting later in the news conference that the outlook for growth had soured. He pointed to problems including tightening financial conditions, weak global growth and the government shutdown.
One point he made insistently was that the Fed was not taking its cues from Mr. Trump, despite the president's constant heckling. "We're human," Mr. Powell said. "We make mistakes. But we're not going to make mistakes of character or integrity."
The Fed on Wednesday also sought to clarify its plans for its giant stockpile of Treasuries and mortgage bonds it accumulated in the wake of the financial crisis. A decade ago, the central bank tried to revive economic activity and reduce borrowing costs for things like cars and mortgages by cutting its benchmark interest rate nearly to zero, and by vacuuming up huge quantities of bonds.
The Fed's bond-buying program was intended to encourage investors to buy riskier assets, like stocks and corporate bonds, by driving up the price of safer securities, like Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities. The Fed's enormous purchases drove down interest rates because, as competition for available Treasuries increased, buyers were forced to accept lower rates of return.
As the economy recovered, the Fed decided to take away that crutch and since the fall of 2017, it has gradually reduced its holdings at a pace of about $45 billion per month. But the Fed said on Wednesday that it planned to stop relatively soon, maintaining a much larger presence in the bond market than it did before the 2008 crisis.
The decision has limited implications for the general public. Some Fed officials and outside experts think that the new approach has improved the Fed's ability to influence economic conditions, like interest rates, but the practical difference is generally regarded as modest.
But it is a big deal for bond markets. The Fed is the world's largest investor, and even small changes in Fed policy make large ripples. The decision was applauded by some investors, who argue that the Fed's withdrawal from the bond market is contributing to the volatility of asset prices. Other investors, however, want the Fed to minimize its profile in the bond market.
In a final bow to markets, the Fed emphasized its plans were subject to change.
"The committee is prepared to adjust any of the details for completing the balance sheet normalization in light of economic and financial developments," the statement said. It added the Fed was even willing to increase the size of the balance sheet, if necessary.

Full text: CARACAS, Venezuela -- Reeling from American oil sanctions, President NicolÃ¡s Maduro's government on Tuesday fought to keep its grip on Venezuela, opening an investigation into what it called the "violent acts" of the nation's opposition leader, freezing his assets and barring him from leaving the country.
The announcement came only hours after the Trump administration said that it had handed control of Venezuela's bank accounts and property in the United States to the opposition leader, Juan GuaidÃ³, hoping to give him the tools to start running the country.
It was one of Washington's most overt attempts in decades to carry out regime change in Latin America. In recent days, the Trump administration has recognized Mr. GuaidÃ³ as Venezuela's legitimate president and imposed sanctions to cut off Mr. Maduro's access to a major source of the nation's cash: oil sales in the United States.
Now the fierce struggle to shape Venezuela is entering a new, uncertain phase. For many in the capital, the only question about Washington's aggressive bid to oust Mr. Maduro and help install an opposition-led interim government is, what took so long?
"It was about time someone took the reins of this disaster," said Angiseth Rodriguez, 23, a student in Venezuela's capital, Caracas. "What they're doing is fast and necessary."
But just across the street, a group of senior citizens waiting in line to collect their pensions worried that the Trump administration's actions would further bankrupt their country and deepen the humanitarian crisis that has left so many starving, sick and without basic services.
"The United States has no business meddling in this," said Aura Ramos, 59, a retiree who can barely afford blood pressure medicine. "It's the regular people who will be affected."
Venezuela has the world's largest proven oil reserves. Yet the country has been devastated by an economic unraveling under Mr. Maduro that has turned pensions nearly worthless, created an acute shortage of food and medicine, and caused millions of people to flee the country.
Last week, Mr. GuaidÃ³, the leader of the opposition-controlled National Assembly, stood before a crowd in the capital and declared himself the country's legitimate president, promising to allow humanitarian aid to enter the country and to call for new elections. Since then, many countries that had denounced Mr. Maduro's re-election for a second term as fraudulent have joined the United States in recognizing Mr. GuaidÃ³ as Venezuela's legitimate leader.
But even as economists made sense of the fine print of the American sanctions -- it is still unclear how much money is at stake and how it might be made available to Mr. GuaidÃ³ -- some expressed fear that the nation could be plunged into anarchy. Even if an interim government had funds, it would still not have control of the country's institutions, including the courts and the armed forces.
The new sanctions, which prohibit returning the proceeds of Venezuelan oil sales in the United States to the Maduro government, will drastically curtail his spending power. Analysts said that could turbocharge what is already the world's worst inflation, worsen fuel shortages and compromise the state's ability to buy and distribute food.
"It goes to the heart of what little remains of stability and the few things that remain under the government's control," Asdrubal Oliveros, an economist who heads the Ecoanalitica consultancy, said of the sanctions. "This makes me very nervous."
But the opposition contends that for a country suffering from economic free-fall and increasingly authoritarian governance, this could be the path to much-needed change.
The sanctions imposed on Pdvsa, Venezuela's state-run oil company, escalated the fight over the country's leadership. Mr. Maduro's attorney general, Tarek William Saab, announced that the government had opened a criminal investigation into Mr. GuaidÃ³'s activities and intended to freeze his assets and bar him from traveling abroad.
"These acts have undermined the peace of the nation," Mr. Saab told reporters.
John Bolton, the United States National Security Advisor, condemned that announcement and warned that there would be "serious consequences for those who attempt to subvert democracy and harm GuaidÃ³."
So far Mr. Maduro has not ordered the arrest of Mr. GuaidÃ³, a step he has taken in the past to neutralize opposition leaders who posed a risk to his power.
Many opposition leaders are sanguine about the turbulence ahead, welcoming Washington's kingmaker role in Venezuela's political standoff as crucial to restoring democracy and starting to rebuild a nation ravaged by mismanagement under Mr. Maduro.
"The people of Venezuela have already suffered too much," said Maria Corina Machado, an opposition leader who has long pressed the United States to take forceful action against the Maduro government. "We must cut off all the sources of financing to this criminal regime."
While there is little doubt that American oil sanctions will be a blow to Mr. Maduro, experts said it was unclear how quickly and widely their effects would be felt.
Crude exports to the United States have fallen by half over the past six years, but the 500,000 barrels a day that Venezuela sells to America still represent 40 percent of its oil exports. Roughly 90 percent of government revenue comes from its oil exports.
Oil experts say one of Venezuela's principal vulnerabilities is a shortage of fuel; its five refineries are working at only 20 percent capacity. Oil traders, tanker companies and insurance companies are hesitating to supply Venezuela with gasoline and other products because they fear they could be fined under the new sanctions.
"The Venezuelans are desperately short of petroleum products like gasoline," said Robert McNally, president of Rapidan Group, an energy consulting firm. "Whether they have 10 days or 20 days of supplies, they have a problem."
The sanctions do not ban American imports of oil but require that funds from purchases go into accounts that are not accessible to the Maduro regime. The United States plans to make them available to Mr. GuaidÃ³'s team, which hopes to lead an effort to get humanitarian aid flowing into the country.
Administration officials estimate that the sanctions could result in export losses of $11 billion over the next year, a crippling blow for a country that already lacks hard currency to buy sufficient food and medicine. Yet some analysts believe those assessments are overblown.
"The sanctions will deal a meaningful blow to the Maduro administration's cash flow, but the effects will not be as harsh as the United States expects," said Paola Rodriguez-Masiu, a Venezuelan oil market analyst for Rystad Energy, a Norwegian consultancy. "The oil that Venezuela currently exports to the United States will be diverted to other countries and sold at lower prices."
Venezuela sells 300,000 barrels a day to India and 240,000 to China, and it makes additional sales to other countries in Europe and Southeast Asia. Many countries can be expected to buy Venezuelan crude if it is offered at deeply discounted prices. Much of the oil that has been shipped to China in recent years has been earmarked for debt repayment, but Beijing has in recent years eased pressure on Venezuela for repayment.
The most painful aspect of the sanctions could be the immediate blocking of sales of American light crude oil to Venezuela, which buys about 120,000 barrels a day to blend with its heavier oil. Without it, Venezuela's gummy production cannot easily flow through pipelines to refineries and export terminals. Without the American supply, Pdvsa will be forced to buy the light oil from African producers, which could mean longer shipping times and higher costs.
While experts and people in the energy industry were debating the implications of the sanctions, many in Venezuela seemed to know little about the measure and its potential effects. State-run media reports have characterized the sanctions as the linchpin of an American-orchestrated coup attempt, but provided little information about the measure's possible impact.
For Blanca Urdaneta, who sells candles to parishioners outside a church in downtown Caracas, news of the escalating tensions between Venezuela and the United States just added to her worries.
"That will spark a war," said Ms. Urdaneta, adding that she had lost faith in both Mr. Maduro and the opposition to fix the country's problems. "And it will bring even more misery to the Venezuelan people."

Full text: There are more than 48,000 people being held in immigrant detention in more than 200 facilities in the United States. More than two-thirds of them, according to the National Immigrant Justice Center, are confined by private companies, working on contracts with the federal government. Those numbers have ballooned in the last two years under the Trump administration, drawing new attention to the terrible conditions detainees are living in.
One feature of privately run centers -- the Voluntary Work Program -- is the subject of six separate lawsuits, which say that privately run immigrant detention centers are coercing detainees into working for a dollar a day and punishing those who don't. The lawsuits demand, among other things, that the practice stop and that detained workers be paid minimum wage.
Congress should not wait for these lawsuits to be decided. Democrats have won the House, so even if they can't stop the president's anti-immigrant push, they can push to raise the obsolete and exploitative $1-a-day wage. And, just as they have rejected Mr. Trump's request for $5.7 billion for the border wall, they should reject the request for $2.8 billion to expand detentions to 52,000 beds.
Prison labor is nearly as old as the American prison system itself, and it is protected by the 13th Amendment, which abolished slavery and indentured servitude except as punishment for a crime. This exception means that prisons can require their prisoners to work, even without compensation.
But immigrant detention is civil confinement, not criminal. People held in these facilities are not charged with any crime; they are being detained while awaiting asylum or deportation hearings. Under Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Voluntary Work Program, however, immigrant detention centers need not pay workers more than one dollar a day, a rate set by Congress in 1950 and codified in the 1978 Appropriations Act. It has never been increased or adjusted for inflation.
Detainees say that the Voluntary Work Program is not really voluntary. If they attempt to take a day off or refuse to work, staff members punish them by withholding essential items, threatening to move them to more dangerous housing units or locking them in their cells. Wilhen Hill Barrientos, a Guatemalan asylum seeker and a plaintiff in the lawsuit against CoreCivic's Stewart Detention Center in Georgia, said that he had to either work for a few cents an hour or go without basic things like soap, which he could get only through the commissary.
According to Mr. Barrientos's lawsuit, one night a guard awakened him for the 2 a.m. shift in the kitchen rather than his scheduled 10 a.m. shift. When he refused, the guard threatened to move him to a violence-plagued dormitory, so Mr. Barrientos acquiesced.
Martha Gonzalez, from Mexico, was detained in three different CoreCivic prisons in Texas from May 2016 to August 2017 as she awaited a T-1 visa, which is granted to victims of human trafficking. She worked in the kitchen and sorted clothing. When she once tried to take a day off, she told me, the prison staff then punished her by refusing to give her basic hygiene supplies such as sanitary pads and toothpaste.
CoreCivic did not respond to Ms. Gonzalez's allegation but said that its work programs are "completely voluntary" and that "detainees are subject to no disciplinary action whatsoever if they choose not to participate in the work program."
A representative for GEO Group called the lawsuits' allegations baseless, saying that "this is a strictly voluntary program" and that GEO Group provides hygiene products free of charge upon request.
Private corporations hold less than 10 percent of the nation's prison population, but more than 70 percent of people in immigration detention. The government pays them a fixed daily price per person, so they have an economic incentive to run their facilities as cheaply as possible, relying on detainees to cook meals, mop hallways, scrub toilets, mow lawns and even cut hair.
In 2016, CoreCivic's revenue from Stewart (where Mr. Barrientos and other detainees worked in the kitchen) was about $38 million; in 2017, contracts with ICE comprised 25 percent of its $444 million in revenue. For GEO Group, ICE contracts comprised 19 percent of its $2.26 billion revenue in 2017.
At the same time, the detention centers provide the barest minimum to detainees, while charging them exorbitant rates for necessities. In immigrant detention, a phone call can cost as much as $12.75 for 15 minutes. Four ounces of toothpaste sells for $11.
These two corporations have become the giants of the private prison industry. Between 2016 and 2018, CoreCivic spent $2.8 million in lobbying and over $700,000 on campaign contributions while GEO Group spent $4.4 million in lobbying and $2.5 million on campaign contributions. Each company also donated $250,000 to Mr. Trump's inauguration.
They blame the 1978 Appropriations Act for the low wages. As GEO Group puts it, "the wage rates associated with this federal government program are stipulated under long-established guidelines set by the United States Congress."
That is true. If Congress instead forced these companies to pay the federal minimum wage, their profit margins would drop dramatically.
But the dollar-a-day rule has stalwart defenders in Congress. In response to a class-action lawsuit in which formerly detained immigrants said they were forced to work, 18 Republican Congressmen sent a letter on March 7, 2018, to then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the head of ICE and the secretary of the Department of Labor, exhorting those agencies to help GEO Group defend itself. "Unless your agencies act to intervene in these lawsuits, immigration enforcement efforts will be thwarted, and the end result will be millions of dollars of unnecessary loss to the federal government in terms of additional expenses for immigration detention," they said. In other words, they worried that if the private prisons were forced to pay reasonable wages, the companies would pass on those costs to the federal government.
The lawsuits are not pushing to end the Voluntary Work Program altogether. They understand that it allows people who are in detention to buy things they need and keep in touch with their families by phone, which becomes even more urgent as the number of families torn apart by detention increases. Instead, the lawsuits are pushing for an end to exploitation and a fair wage for their work.
Yes, paying detainees a minimum wage would make these facilities much more expensive to operate. But if privately run detention centers rely on a business model based on forced labor, perhaps they should not exist at all.

Full text: The Trump administration's rosy view of the economy is increasingly diverging from a decidedly more cautious outlook from other prognosticators, including economists at the Federal Reserve and elsewhere, who are warning that growth is slowing, in part because of the president's own policies.
The side that turns out to be correct could heavily influence President Trump's odds of re-election.
His team has predicted that inflation-adjusted growth will average 3 percent through 2024, a rate that far exceeds what other economists believe the United States economy is capable of, barring sharp growth in the labor force and worker productivity.
Many economists say last year was an outlier, fueled by a brief boost of fiscal stimulus: Growth appears to have topped 3 percent in 2018 for the first time in a decade. Yet Mr. Trump's advisers say there is no reason to doubt the economy will achieve such heights again this year.
"Last year looked just like we thought, so we don't think, going into our next forecast, that there's a heck of a lot of reason to change our mind about things," Kevin A. Hassett, the chairman of Mr. Trump's Council of Economic Advisers, said on Tuesday in an interview. He added: "Things basically worked like we expected."
Economists outside the administration disagree and are projecting that growth will slow this year, as the global economy struggles under the weight of a trade war, a slowdown in China and the waning stimulus from both Mr. Trump's signature tax cuts and additional government spending.
Many forecasters also see a small, but lasting, dent to growth from the partial government shutdown that consumed most of January, and which could recur in February if Mr. Trump and congressional leaders cannot agree on a border security deal. Some corporate financial executives warn that the country could be headed toward recession.
The Congressional Budget Office predicted this week that growth would slow to 2.3 percent this year and to 1.7 percent in 2020, as fiscal stimulus stops bolstering consumer spending and the economy returns to what the C.B.O. estimates is its long-term growth trend. The report estimated that growth was 3.1 percent in 2018, which was nearly on track with the budget office's projections in April last year. The Commerce Department has not released the government's official estimate for 2018 growth yet, because of delays from the shutdown.
Economists at the Fed said in December that they also expect 2.3 percent growth this year. Wall Street economists have similarly trimmed their forecasts. Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report on Tuesday that "soft" economic survey data, including consumer confidence figures and regional Fed business surveys, suggest annualized growth of 2.1 percent for the first half of the year.
A new survey from the National Association of Business Economists found business investment growth slowing across the economy, with 84 percent of respondents saying that Mr. Trump's tax cuts are not encouraging their companies to increase investment. Slowing global growth, particularly in China, has caused other forecasters to lower their growth estimates for the United States this year.
Mr. Trump's advisers have not yet released their official forecast for the year. But White House officials say they continue to believe the economy will significantly outperform the expectations of more pessimistic projections, for several reasons.
The Council of Economic Advisers' forecasting model is more bullish than the C.B.O., in part because the administration finds that much of the sluggish growth in the decade preceding Mr. Trump's election was a hangover from the 2008 financial crisis. The Trump administration also projects a more sustained boost to growth from the $1.5 trillion tax cut package that went into effect last year and deregulatory efforts at agencies across the administration.
Administration officials, who are set to meet with their Chinese counterparts on Wednesday to try to end a trade war, dismiss concerns that trade policy or the shutdown have provided an economic drag.
"We think there's still a very good case for 3 percent this year," Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said Tuesday on Fox Business Network.
Larry Kudlow, the chairman of the National Economic Council, told reporters on Monday that he believed the administration's economic model was working. "The program of lower tax rates and regulatory rollback and opening up energy and so forth is working and continuing to work," Mr. Kudlow said in a briefing at the White House. "And I think frankly the optimists, the guys that took the over, will be right."
Mr. Trump could need that prediction to come true if he hopes to win in 2020. His approval ratings have sagged below 40 percent under the weight of the shutdown, even after recording in 2018 what appears to have been highest annual growth rate since the financial crisis, according to a polling average by the website FiveThirtyEight.
The last president with such low ratings at this point in a first term, Ronald Reagan, rebounded to win 49 states in his 1984 re-election campaign. Underpinning that comeback was a roaring economy: In 1983, the American economy grew 4.6 percent after adjusting for inflation. In 1984, it grew 7.2 percent, an annual rate that has not been matched since. The two presidents who most recently lost re-election, Jimmy Carter and George Bush, both saw growth slow the year before they faced voters again.
With Democrats now controlling the House of Representatives, Mr. Trump may have little opportunity to pass legislation, such as a second round of tax cuts, in an attempt to further stoke the economy. He does have the ability to work with Chinese leaders to secure a trade deal and with congressional Democrats to end the uncertainty over whether the government will shut down again soon, both of which could modestly aid growth.
There are two openings on the Fed's board of governors, and Mr. Trump has indicated through aides that he will aim to fill them with nominees who will push the central bank to keep interest rates low to support growth.
Perhaps the most important component of growth, though, could be what happens to oil prices. Economists at the Penn Wharton Budget Model calculate that as American oil production has increased over the last decade, related in part to the shale boom, investment and growth in the United States have increasingly been tied to crude prices. Rising prices have brought rising investment. Falling prices nearly pushed the country into a contraction near the end of President Barack Obama's second term.
Rising prices lifted growth under Mr. Trump last year, the economists found, and explained the surge in investment that Mr. Trump and his advisers have attributed to the tax cut.
Prices have fallen by nearly 25 percent from their peak level of 2018, leading the budget model's economists to predict that business investment will be weaker at the start of this year than last year -- contrary to what Mr. Trump's team forecasts.
"The fundamentals are not as strong as they look from the top-line numbers," said Alexander Arnon, a senior analyst at the budget model. Rising investment in 2018, he said, was "more attributable to global factors pushing oil prices up, and less to the underlying momentum in business growth."
Mr. Hassett told reporters recently that he higher oil prices most likely contributed to a surge in energy investment in 2018. But, he added, "I'm sure that the drilling and mining effect was magnified by the beneficial tax changes, as well."

Delayed Data Will Leave Fed Filling In the Blanks

Full text: The government is back. Government data, however, will have to wait awhile.
The partial government shutdown left forecasters, investors and policymakers without much of the data they rely on -- just as concerns were mounting that the United States' decade-long economic expansion could be nearing its end.
Now that the monthlong shutdown is over, it will take government statisticians time to collect and analyze delayed figures for retail sales, manufacturing, housing and other parts of the economy. On Monday, the Commerce Department said it would not be able to release an estimate of gross domestic product for the fourth quarter that had been scheduled for Wednesday.
That means that when officials gather Tuesday and Wednesday for a meeting of the Federal Reserve's policymaking group, the Federal Open Market Committee, they will do so without access to much of the information they usually have. The timing is awkward: Fed officials have emphasized in recent months that with the economy's direction uncertain, they will be paying particularly close attention to the latest data when making decisions on interest rates and related matters.
"The F.O.M.C. have told us that policy has become increasingly data dependent, but what data?" said Joel Prakken, chief United States economist for Macroeconomic Advisers, a forecasting firm.
In practice, the central bank had already indicated that it did not plan to raise rates at this week's meeting. But it isn't just the Fed that is struggling with the lack of government reports. Economists, investors and business leaders have all been left without a clear view of the economy.
"We're missing a lot of key releases at a time when the economy appears to be slowing," said Nancy Vanden Houten, senior economist for Oxford Economics. "We're missing data on retail sales at a time when it would be great to see if the shutdown is having an impact on consumer spending. We're not getting trade data at a time when we're in a trade conflict with China."

The shutdown, which idled hundreds of thousands of federal workers and disrupted operations across the country, will also have a direct effect on the economy. The Congressional Budget Office on Monday estimated the economic cost at $11 billion, although much of that will eventually be recovered as operations resume.
Economists haven't been flying completely blind. The Labor Department was unaffected by the shutdown, which meant that the Bureau of Labor Statistics was able to collect and release inflation, unemployment and hiring estimates as usual. The monthly jobs report, arguably the most closely watched indicator each month, will come out Friday as planned. And economists still had access to privately collected statistics on housing, consumer sentiment and other topics.
Still, the pause in funding mostly shuttered the Commerce Department, which houses the Bureau of Economic Analysis and the Census Bureau. That resulted in the delay of several closely watched reports. Last week, the Conference Board published its index of leading indicators -- meant to be a sort of early-warning system for downturns in the economy -- without three of its usual 10 components.
It isn't clear how long it will take government releases to get back on schedule. The answer will probably vary: Data on building permits, for example, is collected by local officials and submitted to the Census Bureau; as a result, the government should be able to gather the information and produce estimates relatively quickly. Retail sales figures, however, are based on a monthly survey that wasn't conducted during the shutdown.
The trickiest report is also arguably the most important: gross domestic product. The broadest measure of goods and services produced in the economy, G.D.P. is based on more than a dozen indicators, including several of the reports that were delayed. That means the government won't be able to produce its estimate until nearly all the other data has been collected.
The Bureau of Economic Analysis said on Monday it would not release G.D.P. data this week and would also delay three other reports scheduled for this week and next, including statistics on consumer spending and international trade. The agency said it was consulting with the Census Bureau and other agencies and could not "say anything definitive about release dates" at this time.
It is possible the Commerce Department could end up skipping the initial estimate of G.D.P. and wait until late February, when it would ordinarily release the first of two revised estimates. That's what happened after the 1995-96 shutdown, the previous record-holder for the longest shutdown.
The greater risk is that the delays in data collection could hurt the quality of the statistics once they are produced. Government surveys are meant to be conducted the same way, at the same time each month, to ensure that the data are consistent over time. Changes can raise the risk of errors, said Maurine Haver, president of Haver Analytics, a data provider.
"Surveys just simply aren't being done, and in some cases will never be replicated," Ms. Haver said.
Economists said the shutdown had most likely ended before serious damage was done. Most major releases will be delayed by weeks, not months. Still, disruptions like these could have longer-run consequences for the confidence people have in government statistics, said Tara Sinclair, an economics professor at George Washington University.
"The U.S. is really considered the gold standard in data for the rest of the world, and we're kind of falling down on our job here," she said.

Full text: For Americans under the age of 40, the 21st century has resembled one long recession.
I realize that may sound like an exaggeration, given that the economy has now been growing for almost a decade. But the truth is that younger Americans have not benefited much.
Look at incomes, for starters. People between the ages of 25 and 34 were earning slightly less in 2017 than people in that same age group had been in 2000:
The wealth trends look even worse. Since the century's start, median net worth has plummeted for every age group under 55:
Why is this happening? The main reason is a lack of economic dynamism. Not as many new companies have been forming since 2000 -- for reasons that experts don't totally understand -- and existing companies have been expanding at a slower rate. (The pace of job cuts has also fallen, which is why the unemployment rate has stayed low.) Rather than starting new projects, companies are sitting on big piles of cash or distributing it to their shareholders.
This loss of dynamism hurts millennials and the younger Generation Z, even as baby boomers are often doing O.K. Because the layoff rate has declined since 2000, most older workers have been able to hold on to their jobs. For those who are retired, their income -- through a combination of Social Security and 401(k)'s -- still outpaces inflation on average.
But many younger workers are struggling to launch themselves into good-paying careers. They then lack the money to buy a first home or begin investing in the stock market. Yes, older workers face their own challenges, like age discrimination. Over all, though, the generational gap in both income and wealth is growing.

Given these trends, you'd think the government would be trying to help the young. But it's not. If anything, federal and state policy is going in the other direction. Medicare and Social Security have been spared from cuts. Programs that benefit younger workers and families have not.
The biggest example is higher education. Over the past decade, states have cut college funding by an average of 16 percent per student. It's a shocking form of economic myopia. In response, tuition has risen, and students have taken on more debt. Worst of all, many students attend colleges with high dropout rates and end up with debt but no degree.
And as badly as the government is treating the young today, the future looks even more ominous.
First, the national debt, while manageable now, is on pace to soar. The primary cause is the cost of health care: Most Americans receive far more in Medicare benefits than they paid in Medicare taxes. The Trump tax cut also plays a role. It is increasing the debt -- and it mostly benefits older, affluent households.
Second, the warming planet is likely to cause terrible damage and bring huge costs.
Young Americans favor aggressive action, now, to slow climate change. But the Republican Party -- which wins elections with strong support from older voters -- has vetoed any such action. As a result, greenhouse gases keep spewing into the atmosphere, and the climate crisis is likely to be far worse than it needs to be. Today's young Americans will be left to suffer the consequences and bear the costs.
Last week, one of those young Americans -- somebody who qualifies as an older millennial -- announced that he was running for president: the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Ind., Pete Buttigieg. A Navy veteran and Rhodes scholar who's been praised by Barack Obama, Buttigieg ("BOOT-edge-edge") is a rising star in Democratic politics. But of course he is a long shot to win the nomination. He is the mayor of a moderate-size city, after all.
And yet I think his candidacy is important, because it has the potential to influence the entire campaign. Buttigieg kicked off his run by talking about "intergenerational justice" and made clear that he would focus sharply on the future. After we spoke on Friday, I looked at my notes and discovered he hadn't said "Trump" once.
During our conversation, I asked him how he hoped to win over older Americans -- who, to their credit, vote at much higher rates than the young -- and he told me an intriguing story. When he first ran for mayor of South Bend in 2011, he had the money to conduct only one poll. In it, his team asked voters how they would feel about having such a young mayor. The group most likely to see it as an advantage were the oldest voters.
"Many of the people who respond most positively to a moral message about the future are older people," he said. "The American story is one of making sure that each generation is better off than the last. I don't want my generation to be the first not to enjoy that. But I also think older generations don't want to be the ones to cause that."
There are some unavoidable trade-offs between the young and the old: A dollar spent on Medicare is unavailable for universal pre-K. But the country's biggest economic problems aren't about hordes of greedy old people profiting off the young. They're about an economy that showers much of its bounty on the already affluent, at the expense of most Americans -- and of our future. The young pay the biggest price for these inequities.
That's a vital subject for the 2020 campaign, whoever the leading candidates end up being.

Full text: Fears of an imminent recession, which caused major turbulence in financial markets at the end of 2018 and beginning of 2019, have eased a bit.
That's the good news. The bad news is what that episode exposed.
For much of 2018, it appeared that the world economy was finally getting out of the rut it had been stuck in for the decade since the global financial crisis. But it now looks as if the era of persistently low growth, low inflation and low interest rates isn't over after all.
In the past week alone, the European Central Bank said that economic risks had "moved to the downside," and the Bank of Japan cut its projections for inflation.
The Federal Reserve will hold a policy meeting Tuesday and Wednesday, and is likely to leave its interest rate target unchanged. Its leaders could also discuss their broader strategy for making monetary policy, which may include keeping more of their giant portfolio of bonds -- accumulated during its years of stimulus efforts -- than analysts had once expected.
Despite some promising signs of vitality during much of last year, issues that have dogged the world economy for the last decade -- an aging work force in many of the biggest economies, weak growth in productivity, excessive global savings and industrial capacity, and a shortage of worldwide demand -- haven't disappeared.
That helps explain why American workers' wages have been rising relatively slowly despite a low unemployment rate. And it makes for a perilous time: Low growth rates mean the economy could slip into recession more easily, and low interest rates mean central bankers would find themselves with less powerful tools to lessen the pain of a future downturn.
"This shows that the forces that are restraining many economies are a lot harder to contend with and more pervasive than many people were hoping or believing," said Roberto Perli, a partner in Cornerstone Macro. "It's bad news for the work force's earnings prospects in many countries and for those who hope for a reversal of the growing inequality trend that has been in place for many years."
Consider that markets went haywire in the final weeks of 2018 in significant part because of fears that the Federal Reserve was raising rates by more than the economy could handle. Jerome Powell, the Fed chairman, played a big role in fueling a stock market rebound when, on Jan. 4, he pledged that the Fed would adjust policy "quickly and flexibly" as conditions warranted.
His predecessor, Janet Yellen, went so far as to say recently that "it's very possible we may have seen the last interest rate hike of this cycle." But what does it mean when a mere 2.4 percent interest rate -- the rough level of the Fed's target after a December increase -- is enough to risk breaking the economy?
The story is even more pessimistic in the European Union, where interest rates are slightly below zero and yet growth is faltering.
With the world economy heavily reliant on stimulus to achieve even meager growth, there is little cushion for a negative shock. In particular, it makes the United States more vulnerable to recession caused by any number of factors, including government shutdowns and trade wars.
Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said, "If this is what growth and investment look like when there is relatively loose monetary and fiscal policy -- especially in the U.S. -- the underlying strength just isn't there.
"That doesn't mean policy is ineffective or ill-advised. Things would be much worse, unnecessarily, if policy tightened a lot. But it is scary to think of the world economy absent macro support," meaning the stimulus provided by low interest rates and large deficits.
There is the risk of a nasty feedback loop. The low-growth trap of the last decade -- and the resulting stagnant incomes -- might have contributed to dysfunctional politics in nations including Britain, Italy and the United States. Those dysfunctional politics in turn can create new risks of economic disruption, as we saw in the recent shutdown standoff in Washington.
Last year began with signs of a new economic era. In early February, the stock market was falling amid concerns that the United States economy was overheating; that wages and prices would start rising too fast; and that the Fed would need to raise interest rates faster to rein things in. Shifts in bond markets suggested investors were betting on higher future inflation, and on higher interest rates in the distant future than in the near future.
For the first time in ages, most of the major advanced and emerging economies were enjoying simultaneous growth surges. As 2018 progressed, inflation in the United States finally moved back up to the 2 percent level that the Federal Reserve targets, and the Fed's pattern of once-a-quarter rate increases became mostly a nonevent in markets.
It was starting to look as if the old economic rules -- that low unemployment would translate into higher inflation, that large government deficits would crowd out private investment -- were becoming true again.
But in the sell-off that knocked about 10 percent off the S&P 500 from the start of October to Christmas Eve, long-term interest rates fell by more than half a percentage point. Bond prices pointed to lower future inflation, as did plunging oil prices.
The expected annual inflation rate in the next decade -- reflected in the price of inflation-protected bonds -- rose to 2.18 percent in April 2018 from 1.66 percent in June 2017. It hovered in the 2.18 range for a few months, then plunged in late October to a recent low of 1.7 percent.
And prices in futures markets reflected expectations that the Fed would enact no more interest rate increases in 2019. Even as the consensus view of Fed officials at their December meeting was that two interest rate increases were on tap for 2019, markets were essentially flashing a signal of "Oh no, you don't."
At the same time, weaker growth in China -- a reported 6.6 percent in 2018, still strong by American or European standards -- removes a source of strength for the global economy. China is trying to wean itself off debt-driven growth.
"Chinese policymakers are well aware they probably have a credit bubble and have tried to be more temperate in response to the current slowdown," said Julia Coronado, president of MacroPolicy Perspectives. "But it is hard to accept low growth potential. We see the political instability that that brings around the world, and China is now faced with the uncomfortable decision of re-initiating stimulus or living with notably slower growth."
The world economy is not in crisis. Low growth is better than no growth -- or outright contraction.
But what the last few months have made clear is that the forces that have held back the global economy for the last 11 years are not temporary, and have not gone away. And that, in turn, makes the world uncommonly vulnerable to a bout of bad luck or bad policy.
The low-growth world was not just a phase. It's the new reality beneath every macroeconomic question and debate for the foreseeable future.

Full text: The colossal disarray over the British government's plans to leave the European Union comes at an awkward moment for global financial markets.
How can anyone in New York hope to make sense of the mess in London when the government in Washington is closed one day, set to re-open the next and in danger of shutting down again soon?
Yet financial markets put a price on just about anything, and they don't stop functioning when governments do. Even when a projected outcome is gruesome or improbable, some traders will try to make a wager on it. Bets on "Brexit" -- Britain's exit from the European Union -- and the effects of the government shutdown in this country are well underway.
Whether these bets are humane or prudent is another question. But the shifting odds on Brexit have moved stock, bond and foreign exchange markets, especially in the past two weeks, as the government of Prime Minister Theresa May has flirted with disaster.
Events in London have grabbed strategists' attention. In a note to clients on Jan. 16, Capital Economics, a research group in London, said it placed a 70 percent probability on this broad outcome: that Britain finds a way to "fudge and delay" its exit from the European Union past the current March 29 deadline.
If that delay becomes certain, or just more likely than it seems now, Capital Economics said, the value of the British pound could be expected to rise. At the same time, British stocks, which have generally lagged behind the S&P 500 since the Brexit referendum in 2016, would probably surge, Capital Economics said.
Abrupt movements in foreign exchange markets have already occurred. The pound fell sharply on Jan. 15, when Parliament dealt Mrs. May a crushing defeat. By the largest margin ever for a major issue, lawmakers rejected the Brexit agreement she had spent months negotiating with the European Union.
But the next day Mrs. May survived a no-confidence vote, not by acclamation but by default: The opposition Labour Party simply could not muster enough votes to defeat her. She has soldiered on, as the Brexit deadline draws ever closer. Not incidentally, the pound has regained some of its lost ground.
March 29 remains a meaningful deadline. One way or another, Britain is scheduled to leave the European Union then. Yet lawmakers and Mrs. May's government have been unable to agree on a course of action. To continue deliberating about what to do, they would need to ask the bloc for an extension, like a team of unruly students who cannot even agree on a topic as a term-paper deadline approaches.
Yet a delay is what most betting people think will happen, according to Capital Economics, which believes a negotiated settlement will, eventually, mitigate much of the harm that could be inflicted by an abrupt exit. This expectation is reflected in current stock, bond and currency prices, Capital Economics said.
Bettors have not ruled out a much more disruptive scenario that is viewed as a low-probability event -- somewhere below 20 percent but above zero. That is Britain's exit on March 29 without any negotiated agreement at all.
What would that mean? The Bank of England has boiled the probable effects down in straightforward and troubling terms. In a November report it projected that such a "no deal Brexit" would be a major shock that could subtract more than 10 percent from Britain's gross domestic product.
Unemployment would soar, inflation would rise and Britain would fall into a serious recession, the central bank said. While the sun set on the British Empire long ago, the fallout of a calamity in Britain for the European Union, the global markets and the worldwide economy, would be significant, if less easily measured.
Goldman Sachs is less sanguine than rank-and-file bettors: In a report this month, it placed the odds that Brexit would be delayed at only 50-50. And, it said, "the distribution of risks around Brexit outcomes is widening."
Goldman placed a 40 percent probability on the chance that Britain, in the end, would not leave the European Union at all, which would be accomplished through another referendum repudiating the original vote. The bank assigned a 10 percent probability to a no-deal Brexit on March 29, with potentially calamitous consequences.
For investors in the United States, Goldman produced a list of companies in the S&P 500 that derive considerable revenue from Britain. Buying shares of these stocks, or betting against them by shorting them, might be a handy way of using the American stock market to place a Brexit wager. The companies include Newmont Mining; PPL, a utility; and three financial services companies: Affiliated Managers; Willis, Towers, Watson; and Invesco.
Corporations active in Britain have been hedging against Brexit for months, of course, by shifting parts of their operations to places deemed more stable.
The latest to announce a move is Dyson, the appliances company privately held by James Dyson, an outspoken Brexit advocate. The company said this week that it would move its headquarters to Singapore. In an article in The Telegraph, Mr. Dyson assured his countrymen that he was making this move because of Asia's expanding place in the company's global operations, not because of Brexit.
Whatever his reasons, most British residents can't hedge against Brexit by relocating part of their households to another country. Instead, if the probability of a wrenching separation from Europe appeared to be rising, prudent people might take the steps that anyone does when a possible disaster looms: hoarding necessities like food, water and medicine; stocking up on cash and fuel; retreating to safer ground, if any can be found.
Such measures may be individual lifesavers, but when many people take them at once, they may make a crisis more severe, especially when confidence in government is ebbing.
Global markets shudder when panics start, which is why bets on potential crises are risky. And if this is true for Brexit, what can we say about the longest government shutdown in United States history?
Financial markets have largely taken the shutdown, and the news Friday of a deal to re-open the government for three weeks, in stride. Despite the pain inflicted on government workers and those who depend on them, economists have generally concluded that the effects will be transitory.
But even if a permanent funding agreement is reached, political tensions in the United States remain high, amid a series of simmering crises that could easily unnerve markets. These include the trade conflict between the United States and China and America's fraying relations with allies like Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan and Mexico.
Market calculations shift swiftly, and hedging against losses on multiple fronts could quickly become the order of the day.

Tariffs Tossed a Market Right Into a Spin Cycle

Full text: You may not have appreciated it at the time -- golden eras have a habit of coming and going like that -- but a five-year stretch that started in 2013 was a pretty great time to buy a washing machine.
Inflation for home laundry equipment, as measured by the Labor Department, fell steadily during that time, which meant you could buy the same washer your neighbor bought last year for less money. Or you could buy a better one at the same price. Great news for your clothes, though maybe bad news for your friendship, if your neighbor was the covetous type.
That stretch of laundry deflation ended last year, shortly after President Trump imposed tariffs, starting at 20 percent, on imported washers. The move was a response to a complaint filed by Whirlpool, a Michigan-based manufacturer.
The company has long dominated the washing machine business -- many Americans have had Whirlpools in their laundry rooms for decades -- but has recently faced stiffer competition from foreign manufacturers. Whirlpool claimed that foreign competitors like LG and Samsung were flooding the appliance market with washing machines from South Korea and Mexico at prices so low that they were hurting American makers.
As an effort to help domestic producers, the tariffs worked -- very briefly. Whirlpool added 200 jobs at its factory in Clyde, Ohio. Its stock price jumped $20 per share in the first few days after the tariffs took effect.
Then things went bad.
A year after Mr. Trump announced the tariffs, washing machine prices were up, as many analysts had expected. But that has not been a boon to the makers of washers because fewer Americans are investing in new laundry equipment, exposing how protectionist trade policies can backfire on the very companies they are meant to safeguard.
Tariffs of two varieties have pushed prices up
The washer-specific tariffs raised costs for importers like LG and Samsung. But another tariff issued by Mr. Trump, on imported steel, raised costs for some domestic manufacturers like Whirlpool, which took those companies by surprise.
Many manufacturers passed those higher costs on to consumers. Once stores worked their way through models that had been imported before tariffs hit, deflation gave way to sharp price increases.
After years of steady growth, sales reversed in 2018
A basic rule of economics is that when the price of something goes up, people buy less of it. That's just what happened to washing machines.
Data from the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers shows that shipments of washing machines increased by an average of 5 percent a year from 2015 to 2017. Last year, shipments fell 3 percent.
Retailers saw that reaction in real time. "We have seen, as you mentioned, tariffs' impact in laundry," Craig Menear, the chairman and chief executive of the Home Depot, told analysts on an earnings call in November.
Retailers were hurt, but manufacturers were hurt more
Washing machines make up a small slice of Home Depot's business. They're more important for Whirlpool, Samsung and other manufacturers -- and the stocks of those businesses have been hammered this year. Laundry appliances made up nearly 30 percent of Whirlpool's sales in 2017. The company's shares gave up their initial gains after the tariffs were announced, and then fell some more.
Through the third quarter, Whirlpool's unit sales were down 2.5 percent in North America, compared with the same period in its previous fiscal year. The company's executives said in an October earnings call that they expected to be hit by an additional $300 million in cost increases, largely driven by the steel tariff, in the year to come.
A Whirlpool spokesman declined to comment, citing a company policy not to talk about continuing trade issues. But the company confirmed it did, in fact, add 200 employees in Ohio.
Things should get better in 2019
Mr. Trump's tariff rate on washing machines will drop two percentage points, to 18 percent, this year, which should mildly ease the pressure on companies and consumers. Retailers say they have seen signs that suggest the worst is over: Ted Decker, executive vice president for merchandising at Home Depot, told analysts in November that after several difficult months with washing machines, "our laundry sales and unit productivity is on par, if not slightly better, than the average of our overall appliance business."
The three-month average for laundry equipment inflation peaked in July, at 20 percent. In December, that increase was just 1.6 percent. This makes sense, economically: Tariffs jolted prices upward, but the overall trend in the appliance industry remains downward. If your neighbor bought a new washer last June and you buy the same one this June, there's a decent chance it will be cheaper.
You might not even need to wait that long. Retail websites suggest that if you run out to your local appliance store this weekend, you're likely to find a bunch of washing machines, American made and imported, on sale.

Full text: Conspicuous by its relative absence in much of the mainstream news coverage of Venezuela's political crisis is the word "socialism." Yes, every sensible observer agrees that Latin America's once-richest country, sitting atop the world's largest proven oil reserves, is an economic basket case, a humanitarian disaster, and a dictatorship whose demise cannot come soon enough.
But ... socialist? Perish the thought.
Or so goes a line of argument that insists socialism's good name shouldn't be tarred by the results of experience. On Venezuela, what you're likelier to read is that the crisis is the product of corruption, cronyism, populism, authoritarianism, resource-dependency, U.S. sanctions and trickery, even the residues of capitalism itself. Just don't mention the S-word because, you know, it's working really well in Denmark.
Curiously, that's not how the Venezuelan regime's admirers used to speak of "21st century socialism," as it was dubbed by Hugo ChÃ¡vez. The late Venezuelan president, said Britain's Jeremy Corbyn, "showed us there is a different and a better way of doing things. It's called socialism, it's called social justice, and it's something that Venezuela has made a big step toward." Noam Chomsky was similarly enthusiastic when he praised ChÃ¡vez in 2009. "What's so exciting about at last visiting Venezuela," the linguist said, is that "I can see how a better world is being created and can speak to the person who's inspired it."
Nor were many of the ChÃ¡vez's admirers overly worried about his regime's darker sides. Chomsky walked back some of his praise as Venezuela became more overtly dictatorial, but others on the left weren't as squeamish. In a lengthy obituary in The Nation, New York University professor Greg Grandin opined, "the biggest problem Venezuela faced during his rule was not that ChÃ¡vez was authoritarian but that he wasn't authoritarian enough."
At least Grandin could implicitly concede that socialism ultimately requires coercion to achieve its political aims; otherwise, it's human nature for people to find loopholes and workarounds to keep as much of their property as they can.
That's more than can be said for some of ChÃ¡vez's erstwhile defenders, who would prefer to forget just how closely Venezuela followed the orthodox socialist script. Government spending on social programs? Check: From 2000 to 2013, spending rose to 40 percent of G.D.P., from 28 percent. Raising the minimum wage? Check. NicolÃ¡s Maduro, the current president, raised it no fewer than six times last year (though it makes no difference in the face of hyperinflation). An economy based on co-ops, not corporations? Check again. As Naomi Klein wrote in her fawning 2007 book, "The Shock Doctrine," "ChÃ¡vez has made the co-ops a top political priority ... By 2006, there were roughly 100,000 cooperatives in the country, employing more than 700,000 workers."
And, lest we forget, all of this was done as ChÃ¡vez won one election after another during the oil-boom years. Indeed, one of the chief selling points of Chavismo to its Western fans wasn't just that it was an example of socialism, but of democratic socialism, too.
If the policy prescriptions were familiar, the consequences were predictable.
Government overspending created catastrophic deficits when oil prices plummeted. Worker co-ops wound up in the hands of incompetent and corrupt political cronies. The government responded to its budgetary problems by printing money, leading to inflation. Inflation led to price controls, leading to shortages. Shortages led to protests, leading to repression and the destruction of democracy. Thence to widespread starvation, critical medical shortages, an explosion in crime, and a refugee crisis to rival Syria's.
All of this used to be obvious enough, but in the age of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez it has to be explained all over again. Why does socialism never work? Because, as Margaret Thatcher explained, "eventually you run out of other people's money."
What now? The Trump administration took exactly the right step in recognizing National Assembly leader Juan GuaidÃ³ as Venezuela's constitutionally legitimate president. It can bolster his personal security by warning Venezuela's generals that harm will come to them if harm comes to him. It can enhance his political standing by providing access to funds that can help him establish an alternative government and entice wavering figures in the Maduro camp to switch sides. It can put Venezuela on the list of state sponsors of terrorism, and warn Cuba that it will be returned to the list if it continues to aid Caracas's intelligence apparatus.
And it can help arrange legal immunity and a plane for Maduro, his family, and other leading members of the regime if they will agree to resign now. Surely there's a compound in Havana where that gang can live out their days without tyrannizing a nation.
In the meantime, the larger lesson of Venezuela's catastrophe should be learned. Twenty years of socialism, cheered by Corbyn, Klein, Chomsky and Co., led to the ruin of a nation. They may not be much embarrassed, much less personally harmed, by what they helped do. It's for the rest of us to take care that it never be done to us.

Full text: MEXICO CITY -- The United States' support this week of an opposition leader as Venezuela's interim president seemed to follow a pattern familiar to Latin America, reawakening suspicions of Washington's intentions in the region and calling to mind American interventions in recent decades.
"Don't trust the gringos," President NicolÃ¡s Maduro of Venezuela said this week, listing United States-backed military coups in the region. "They don't have friends or loyalties. They only have interests, guts and the ambition to take Venezuela's oil, gas and gold."
But where in the past the United States might have felt isolated in Latin America, this time it has company. Many of the nations in the region have denounced Mr. Maduro and instead recognized the opposition leader, Juan GuaidÃ³, as the country's legitimate president.
Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Guatemala, Chile, Canada and other nations have joined the Trump administration, concerned by the economic and humanitarian crisis in Venezuela and its destabilizing effect on the region.
President Mauricio Macri of Argentina was one of several leaders in the region who publicly supported Mr. GuaidÃ³.
"Argentina will support all efforts at rebuilding Venezuelan democracy and re-establishing dignified living conditions for all its citizens," Mr. Macri wrote on Twitter.
And the argument that the Trump administration is motivated by greed for natural resources is undermined, analysts say, by the fact that the United States and Venezuela already have a mutual dependence in the energy sector.
The United States is Venezuela's largest foreign customer for crude exports, buying half a million barrels a day, which accounts for the majority of cash that Venezuela gets for crude shipments. And Venezuela buys about 100,000 barrels a day of light crude from the United States, which it mixes with heavier Venezuelan crude to move it through pipelines to refineries and export terminals.
"You've got this groundswell of opinion among the majority of Latin American governments that, regardless of what the United States said, this is an opportunity to rid the region of a dictatorship that has been a blight upon the democratic record in the region over the last couple of decades," said Duncan Wood, director of the Mexico Institute at the Wilson Center in Washington.
The United States and many countries in Latin America have long been concerned about Venezuela under Mr. Maduro, as the once-prosperous country plunged into an economic tailspin, with soaring inflation, chronic shortages of food and medicine and the spread or resurgence of diseases long under control.
The crisis, also marked by human rights abuses and the repression of the political opposition, has driven more than three million Venezuelans to flee the country, threatening to destabilize the region and putting immense pressure on nearby nations, including Colombia and Brazil, that have struggled to absorb the influx.
In a measure adopted by the Organization of American States this month, 17 Latin American countries, along with the United States and Canada, denounced Mr. Maduro's government as illegitimate.
On Thursday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, speaking at an O.A.S. meeting, called on nations in the Americas to break ties with Mr. Maduro and recognize Mr. GuaidÃ³ as Venezuela's legitimate head.
"The regime of former president NicolÃ¡s Maduro is illegitimate," he said. "His regime is morally bankrupt, it's economically incompetent, and it is profoundly corrupt, and it is undemocratic to the core."
Several of Venezuela's longstanding leftist allies in the region -- Bolivia, Cuba and Nicaragua -- have expressed support for Mr. Maduro.
The Cuban government, in a statement on Thursday, said it "condemns and energetically rejects the attempt to impose a coup d'Ã©tat, a puppet government at the service of the United States" in Venezuela.
"The true objectives of actions against Venezuela are to control the vast resources of this sister nation," the statement said.
Those nations have also been joined by Mexico, which until recently stood squarely among the regional governments pushing Mr. Maduro to institute democratic reforms.
President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador of Mexico, who assumed office on Dec. 1, has taken a friendlier stance than his predecessor toward Mr. Maduro and insisted that he will support a policy of nonintervention in other countries' affairs.
This month, Mr. LÃ³pez Obrador refused to sign a declaration by the Lima Group, a regional bloc formed to find a peaceful solution to the crisis in Venezuela, that urged Mr. Maduro not to take office for a second term and to cede power to the opposition-controlled National Assembly.
"Nonintervention, the people's self-determination, peaceful settlement of disputes and respect for human rights," Mr. LÃ³pez Obrador said Thursday. "It is not that we are for or against. We are for the fulfillment of the constitutional principles."
That position has received support from some prominent members of the Mexican political establishment.
"Regardless of the reservations or criticisms that one may have toward the government of President Maduro, the North American interference is unacceptable," HÃ©ctor Vasconcelos, a senator and president of the Mexican Senate's foreign relations committee, said on Twitter.
In a separate message on Twitter, Mr. Vasconcelos, a member of Mr. LÃ³pez Obrador's party, added: "Nothing will contribute more to the questioning of the legitimacy and credibility of Juan GuaidÃ³ than the support he is receiving from the United States. We are in Latin America and this should be understood by the White House."
He then urged the Trump administration to "learn something from history."

Full text: If you are wondering why Venezuela is back on the front pages, why the Trump administration is making such a big fuss about it, and why observers seem so anxious about the country's political crisis, then this primer is for you.
Why is Venezuela in the news right now?
There are three immediate reasons, all related to a political crisis that has been building in the country for years.
First, there were nationwide protests against the government on Wednesday. They were the first large-scale demonstrations since the president, NicolÃ¡s Maduro, reacted to the last round of large demonstrations, in 2017, with a deadly crackdown.
Second, an opposition lawmaker named Juan GuaidÃ³ declared the current government illegitimate and announced that he would be willing to lead a caretaker government. On its own, Mr. GuaidÃ³'s statement can't force any real change. But it has heightened speculation that the military could push out the government.
Third, the United States and several other governments in the Western Hemisphere have announced that they consider Mr. GuaidÃ³ to be Venezuela's legitimate leader.
Why is Venezuela in crisis?
The short version: Venezuela's government has overseen the destruction of its democracy and its economy. Public outrage is coming to a head.
Venezuela was once Latin America's richest country and one of its longest-running democracies.
Today, it is nearly a failed state. Runaway inflation has plunged much of the country into desperate poverty. Food and drug shortages are widespread. Public order is collapsing and crime rising. More than three million Venezuelans have fled the country, many as refugees.
Public anger is over more than corruption and mismanagement of the economy. The government is aggressively consolidating power and undermining democratic institutions, leaving Venezuelans without meaningful avenues for challenging or changing their leadership. So, many are taking to the streets to try to force change.
Why are things coming to a head now?
The most immediate trigger was the inauguration ceremony this month for President NicolÃ¡s Maduro. He won re-election in May in a vote that has been widely criticized within Venezuela and abroad as rigged.
Since that vote, opposition figures and foreign governments, including many in Latin America, have called Mr. Maduro's leadership illegitimate. Protesters came out after Mr. Maduro's inauguration to send the same message, hoping to pressure him to step down.
But in many ways, this is just the latest step in a crisis that has been getting steadily worse for years.
How did things in Venezuela get so bad?
We wrote a full-length explainer last year recounting Venezuela's collapse.
The shorter version starts not long after a left-wing populist named Hugo ChÃ¡vez led a failed military coup in 1992, reflecting popular discontent with the political establishment. Mr. ChÃ¡vez won the presidency in a 1998 election.
Initially, Mr. ChÃ¡vez implemented popular changes to fight corruption and poverty. While Mr. ChÃ¡vez was not wrong to see his country's political and business establishments as riven with cronyism and graft, he took them on with presidential decrees that consolidated power for himself.
Things took a turn in 2002, when an economic downturn helped prompt antigovernment protests. After violence broke out, the military detained Mr. ChÃ¡vez and imposed an interim leader. Forces loyal to Mr. ChÃ¡vez quickly restored order and the coup leaders quickly backed down, but Mr. ChÃ¡vez returned to power bent on rooting out what he saw as enemies within.
From then until his death in 2013, Mr. ChÃ¡vez waged war on Venezuelan institutions and civil society, hollowing out his country's democracy. He turned to cronyism and handouts to maintain support among his supporters and crucial allies like the military.
Mr. Maduro, his vice president, took over after Mr. ChÃ¡vez's death. He was a weaker leader and therefore relied far more on handouts at a time when the government had even less money.
So Mr. Maduro simply printed more money. This drove up inflation, making basic goods unaffordable, so he instituted price controls and fixed the exchange rate. This caused shortages and made many imports prohibitively expensive. Businesses shut down. Food and medicine became scarce.
This cycle sent many Venezuelans into poverty. Many members of the police and military, who were also struggling to feed their families, turned to black marketeering. Gangs took control of city streets and the murder rate spiked to become one of the world's highest.
Can I blame Venezuela's crisis on socialism and/or Western imperialism?
That is a popular approach for many Americans (as well as Mexicans, Brazilians and other Latin Americans), who often portray Venezuela's implosion as proof that their domestic political opponents are dangerous threats.
Certainly, Mr. ChÃ¡vez was a dedicated leftist who spent heavily on social programs and who nationalized much of the economy, which played into his country's crises. It's also true that the United States opposed his rule and sought to isolate his influence in Latin America, a policy that was seen by many in the region as continuing decades of imperial meddling.
But most experts on Venezuela or on the backsliding of democracies reject these explanations. Rather, they see Venezuela's crisis as having emerged from factors that can exist in any democracy, and are worsening in democracies worldwide: political polarization, distrust in institutions and desire for a strong leader to impose order.
And experts put particular focus on Mr. ChÃ¡vez's anti-establishment, strongman tendencies -- something that is not particular to left- or right-wing leaders. You can read our story here on why populist leaders like Mr. ChÃ¡vez, regardless of their ideologies or intentions, often steer democracies toward authoritarianism.
Does it matter that the United States recognized the opposition lawmaker as Venezuela's legitimate leader?
Maybe, but probably not by any major degree.
There is some research suggesting that a government becomes more likely to fall if people in that country view the leader as having lost international legitimacy. And Washington's recognition of Mr. GuaidÃ³, the opposition figure, as the country's legitimate president may give him access to some Venezuelan assets that had been frozen in the United States.
Still, it was already crystal clear that President Trump's government opposed Mr. Maduro and wanted him out, so this is not a major shift. The same goes for other Latin American countries that have recognized Mr. GuaidÃ³.
Despite some American officials hinting at a willingness to consider military force to bring down Mr. Maduro, the whispers appear unlikely to turn into action. Such an intervention would take months to execute and has no real support in the American military, the electorate or in Congress. It is not even clear what military action would be meant to accomplish or how it would do this, and it would virtually guarantee a major backlash internationally and within Venezuela.
What will happen next?
There are two sets of actors who could force Mr. Maduro to step down.
The first includes members of Mr. Maduro's own government, though the crisis has grown so bad that many of them probably fear prison or worse should they lose power. And they would lose their access to handouts, sending them into the same bread lines as everyone else.
The second would be members of the Venezuelan military, which Mr. Maduro has, perhaps wisely, avoided ordering to crack down on protesters. Some low-level officers have moved against Mr. Maduro, but the rest have remained loyal. The military benefits tremendously from the status quo; Mr. Maduro has allowed them to take control of black marketeering and some trade in natural resources.
If neither group removes Mr. Maduro and he refuses to step down, it is very hard to say what will happen. History provides few obvious parallels.
On one hand, with the situation spiraling out of control, it feels impossible that the status quo could continue. On the other, the same could have been said one, two or even three years ago, and yet Venezuela has continued its steady, tragic decline.

Full text: Russell Baker, the two-time Pulitzer Prize-winning author whose whimsical, irreverent "Observer" column appeared in The New York Times and hundreds of other newspapers for 36 years and turned a backwoods-born Virginian into one of America's most celebrated writers, died on Monday at his home in Leesburg, Va. He was 93.
The cause was complications of a fall, his son Allen said.
Mr. Baker, along with the syndicated columnist Art Buchwald (who died in 2007), was one of the best-known newspaper humorists of his time, and The Washington Post ranked his best-selling autobiography, "Growing Up," with the most enduring recollections of American boyhood -- those of James Thurber, H. L. Mencken and Mark Twain.
In a career begun in a rakish fedora and the smoky press rooms of the 1940s, Mr. Baker was a police reporter, a rewrite man and a London correspondent for The Baltimore Sun, and after 1954 a Washington correspondent for The Times, rising swiftly with a clattering typewriter and a deft writer's touch to cover the White House, Congress and the presidential campaigns of 1956 and 1960.
Then, starting in 1962, he became a columnist for The Times and its news service, eventually composing nearly 5,000 "Observer" commentaries -- 3.7 million insightful words on the news of the day -- often laced with invented characters and dialogue, on an array of subjects including dreaded Christmas fruitcake and women's shoulder pads. The columns, which generated a devoted following, critical acclaim and the 1979 Pulitzer for distinguished commentary, ended with his retirement in 1998.
To a generation of television watchers, he was also a familiar face as the host of "Masterpiece Theater" on PBS from 1993 to 2004, having succeeded Alistair Cooke.
Mr. Baker wrote 15 books, including many collections of his columns, and "Growing Up," a 1982 memoir of his Depression-era youth, his inspirational mother and America between the wars. It earned him his second Pulitzer, the 1983 prize for biography. Besides his two Pulitzer Prizes, he won two George Polk Awards, for commentary in 1978 and career achievement in 1998, and many other honors.
After his retirement from The Times, Mr. Baker wrote for The New York Review of Books on politics, history, journalism and other subjects. A collection of 11 of those essays, on revered public figures, was published in 2002 under the title "Looking Back."
Earlier, he wrote for Life, Look, Reader's Digest, The Saturday Evening Post, Ladies' Home Journal and other publications. From 1985 through 1994, he served on the Columbia University Pulitzer Prize board, selecting winners of the nation's most prestigious awards in journalism, literature and the arts. He was its chairman in 1993 and 1994.
'Ballet in a Telephone Booth'
But it was as a columnist that Mr. Baker made his name. Based at first in Washington, he recalled that he had to feel his way in the new genre of spoof and jape. "Nobody knew what the column was going to be," he told the writer Nora Ephron. "I didn't. The Times didn't."
But soon he was doing what he called his "ballet in a telephone booth," creating in the confined space of 750 words satirical dialogues, parodies and burlesques of politicians and the whirling capital circus -- then stoking the fires of the antiwar and civil rights struggles of the 1960s and the Watergate scandal that forced President Richard M. Nixon from office in 1974.
That year, Mr. Baker moved from Washington to New York, and his column changed. His topics grew more varied, less tied to news events and more to the trappings of ordinary life. His writing, admirers said, matured into literature: an owlish wit, sometimes surreal, often absurdist, usually scouring dark corridors of paradox, always carried off with a subtext of good sense.
He wrote of Francisco Franco's dying and going straight to the New York Department of Motor Vehicles. In another column, a pseudonymous Sykes tells of awakening one day to find that he has someone else's feet. Sykes conceals the shame from his wife and colleagues. Doctors are no help. Finally he confides to an editor, who signs him to a three-book contract. The feet become television celebrities. Hollywood wants Sykes's life story for a Robert Redford movie.
In 1975, after The Times's food editor and restaurant critic Craig Claiborne reported in gastronomic detail on a $4,000 31-course epicurean repast for two, with wines, in Paris, Mr. Baker wrote "Francs and Beans," describing his own culinary triumph after coming home to find a note in the kitchen saying his wife had gone out.
"The meal opened with a 1975 Diet Pepsi served in a disposable bottle," he wrote. "Although its bouquet was negligible, its distinct metallic aftertaste evoked memories of tin cans one had licked experimentally in the first flush of childhood's curiosity." And on to a "pÃ¢tÃ© de fruites de nuts of Georgia": "A half-inch layer of creamy-style peanut butter is troweled onto a graham cracker, then half a banana is crudely diced and pressed firmly into the peanut butter and cemented in place as it were by a second graham cracker."
Two years later, he conceived "A Taxpayer's Prayer":
"O mighty Internal Revenue, who turneth the labor of man to ashes, we thank thee for the multitude of thy forms which thou has set before us and for the infinite confusion of thy commandments which multiplieth the fortunes of lawyer and accountant alike. ..."

His targets were legion: the Super Bowl, Miss America, unreadable menus, everything on television, trips with children, the jogging craze, the perils of buying a suit, loneliness and book-of-the-month clubs. He struck poses of despair that resonated with harried readers: of his endless effort to read Proust, of lacking the gene for resisting salesmen, of boredom with dull dirty books.
Stylistically, the "Observer" examined the American scene with plain phrases that echoed Twain as they skewered the pompous. But his voice could be haunting, as in a 1974 column on older poor people in a supermarket: "Staring at 90-cent peanut butter. Taking down an orange, looking for the price, putting it back."
"Old people at the supermarket are being crushed and nobody is even screaming," he wrote.
Mr. Baker occasionally hammered at uncaring government or big business, but frontal attacks were not his stock in trade. "What Baker does," Ronald Steel wrote in Geo magazine in 1983, "is punch holes in vast bubbles of pretension, humanize the abstract and connect the present with what one predecessor, Walter Lippmann, once described as the 'longer past and the larger future."'
A subversive among the sober editorial voices of The Times, Mr. Baker could be tongue-in-cheek one day and melancholy the next, then folksy, anguished, lyrical or acid. He once wrote a Jonathan Swift-like satire on the advantages of public hanging, arguing that a society pleased with capital punishment might do well to cut off thieves' hands and notch the noses of incurable double parkers.
His column ran on three weekdays a week from 1962 to 1972, then switched to a schedule he likened to the "metronomic" rhythms of "Chinese water torture: FridaySundayTuesday, FridaySundayTuesday."
After 1988, the column ran on Tuesdays and Saturdays. He cut back to one a week in July 1997 and retired "Observer" on Dec. 25, 1998.
His last column, "A Few Words at the End," on Christmas, "a day on which nobody reads a newspaper anyhow," spoke of his love affair with newspapers.
"Thanks to newspapers," he wrote, "I have made a four-hour visit to Afghanistan, have seen the Taj Mahal by moonlight, breakfasted at dawn on lamb and couscous while sitting by the marble pool of a Moorish palace in Morocco and once picked up a persistent family of fleas in the Balkans."

Lanky and laconic, Mr. Baker was reminiscent of Jimmy Stewart's reporter in the 1948 movie "Call Northside 777." He had a rumpled, tired look, as if he had pored over old court records all night under a dim bulb and come to the prison, still skeptical, to see the wrongly convicted man. Ms. Ephron saw him as "extremely low-key, terribly nice, often on the verge of being embarrassed, particularly by praise of any sort."
He had kindly blue eyes with droopy lids and an unruly thatch of sandy-gray hair that fell over his forehead like a country boy's. He liked to flop in a chair, put his foot up on a radiator and talk about practically anything. His voice was gravelly but soft, a faded echo of rural Virginia: perfect for the barbed lash or the awful oxymoron.
And he was as devilish in person as in print. A fellow Times columnist, Tom Wicker, recalled that Mr. Baker, talking once to college students, was asked, "What courses should a journalism school teach?"
He replied: "The ideal journalism school needs only one course. Students should be required to stand outside a closed door for six hours. Then the door would open, someone would put his head around the jamb and say, 'No comment.' The door would close again, and the students would be required to write 800 words against a deadline."
The Making of a Newsman
Russell Wayne Baker was born into poverty on Aug. 14, 1925, in Loudoun County, Va., and spent his early years in Morrisonville. "It was primitive," he recalled. "No electricity." When Russell was 5, his father, Benjamin Rex Baker, a stonemason who was often out of work, drank moonshine one night, sank into a diabetic coma and died, leaving his wife and three children destitute.
Russell's strong-willed mother, Lucy Elizabeth Robinson Baker, was forced to give up an infant daughter to childless in-laws and took the boy and his younger sister to live with her brother in Newark. The uncle, a $35-a-week butter salesman, was the family's only wage earner in the Depression, though Mrs. Baker eventually found work as a seamstress and Russell sold magazines door to door.
When Russell was 11, the family moved to Baltimore, where he attended high school. He was popular, a member of the track team and a promising writer, winning a senior essay contest with "The Art of Eating Spaghetti."
He entered Johns Hopkins University on a scholarship in 1942, but left the next year to join the Navy. He took pilot training, but never went abroad during World War II and left the service in 1945.
Returning to Johns Hopkins on the G.I. Bill, Mr. Baker graduated with a bachelor's degree in English in 1947. He wanted to be Ernest Hemingway, but had no real idea what to do. Then a friend who worked part time for The Baltimore Sun told him about a job. It was not much, but he took it: $30 a week as a night police reporter.
For two years, he phoned in robberies, fires and mayhem, and slept late. He helped organize the Newspaper Guild at The Sun and became a tenacious unionist.
In the summer of 1948, he churned out a novel about a reporter in love. He had just broken up with Miriam Emily Nash, a native of Camden, N.J., whom he had met after the war. The novel wound up in the attic, but he married Mimi, as she was called, in 1950. She died in 2015 at 88.
Mr. Baker is survived by three children, Allen, Michael and Kasia, as well as four grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. He is also survived by two sisters, Doris Groh and Mary Leslie Keech.
By 1950, Mr. Baker had become a rewrite man, taking phoned notes from legmen (reporters at the scene) and banging out stories on deadline. He found he was hooked on journalism, and his skills -- speed, accuracy and style -- earned him a plum in 1952 when The Sun sent him to London as a correspondent. He later became The Sun's White House correspondent, and his work in the capital caught the eye of James Reston, the Washington bureau chief of The Times, who hired him in 1954.
His first Times assignment was the State Department. He found it boring. Congress, with its preening V.I.P.s, was better grist. Readers devoured Baker articles peppered with wry observations that captured the feel of Washington. He was soon drawing top assignments: presidential campaigns in 1956 and 1960, trips by Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy, and others that showcased his lucidity.
Taking a New Direction
But he was still restless. Trying to keep out of a rut, he wrote "An American in Washington" (1961), a guide to the capital, detailing the techniques of name-dropping, the importance of lunch and advice on how to talk endlessly without saying anything. Critics and readers were delighted, but ennui sat naggingly on his shoulder.
One day he found himself on a bench outside a closed meeting of a Senate committee, wondering why, at 37, he was "waiting for somebody to come out and lie to me." He was near the end. In 1962, The Sun tried to lure him back with a column, but The Times made a counteroffer, and he accepted.
The column idea was vague. He had in mind casual essays like E. B. White's in The New Yorker, cast in "plain English" with "short sentences," in contrast to what he called The Times's "polysyllabic Latinate English."
Soon the columns began to roll out of his typewriter: on the foibles of politicians, bureaucrats, military contractors. Spoofing a plan to haul nuclear weapons around the country on railroad cars, he proposed a system of mobile Pentagons, complete with little secretaries of defense and presidents who would crisscross the country to confuse the enemy.
During the Pentagon Papers case -- a test of government secrecy versus the public's right to know the truth about the Vietnam War -- Mr. Baker wondered in print how long officials intended to suppress the "Myles Standish papers," saying their disclosure might jeopardize national security.
Many Baker columns were collected in books, including "No Cause for Panic" (1964), "Baker's Dozen" (1964), "All Things Considered" (1965) and "Poor Russell's Almanac" (1972). He wrote a novel, "Our Next President: The Incredible Story of What Happened in the 1968 Elections" (1968), about an election being thrown into the House of Representatives and chaos enveloping America. Some reviewers called it all too real.
After moving to New York in 1974, Mr. Baker took up topics as varied as death and dishwashing, neuroses and the new math. He was often hard-pressed for ideas, but something always seemed to turn up, or down. One day, as the deadline approached, a potato fell past his window. The column the next day was headlined "Potato Mashes Man."
His 1979 Pulitzer -- the first to a humorist for commentary -- was given for 10 columns on tax reform, inflation, the short life of trends, loneliness, fear, Norman Rockwell and other subjects. More collections were published: "So This Is Depravity" (1980) and "The Rescue of Miss Yaskell and Other Pipe Dreams" (1983).
After the success of "Growing Up," Mr. Baker produced a sequel, "The Good Times," in 1989, about his days as a young reporter. Though a best seller only briefly, it was hailed by critics. Writing in The Times, Frank Conroy, whose memoir "Stop-Time" had also found wide acclaim, called "The Good Times" splendid, but complained, "It would certainly make life easier for book reviewers if Russell Baker could manage to write something bad once in a while."
As the host of "Masterpiece Theater," Mr. Baker once did a riff on snooty British clubs, and recalled that Art Buchwald had invited him to join a club he was starting, the American Academy of Humor Columnists.
"What's the purpose?" Mr. Baker asked.
"To keep other people out," his colleague replied.

Full text: Russell Baker, the two-time Pulitzer Prize-winning author whose whimsical, irreverent "Observer" column appeared in The New York Times and hundreds of other newspapers for 36 years and turned a backwoods-born Virginian into one of America's most celebrated writers, died on Monday at his home in Leesburg, Va. He was 93.
The cause was complications from a fall, according to his son Allen Baker.
Mr. Baker, along with the syndicated columnist Art Buchwald (who died in 2007), was one of the best-known newspaper humorists of his time, and The Washington Post ranked his best-selling autobiography, "Growing Up," with the most enduring recollections of American boyhood -- those of James Thurber, H. L. Mencken and Mark Twain.
In a career begun in a rakish fedora and the smoky press rooms of the 1940s, Mr. Baker was a police reporter, a rewrite man and a London correspondent for The Baltimore Sun, and after 1954 a Washington correspondent for The Times, rising swiftly with a clattering typewriter and a deft writer's touch to cover the White House, Congress and the presidential campaigns of 1956 and 1960.
Then, starting in 1962, he became a columnist for The Times and its news service, eventually composing nearly 5,000 "Observer" commentaries -- 3.7 million insightful words on the news of the day -- often laced with invented characters and dialogue, on an array of subjects including dreaded Christmas fruitcake and women's shoulder pads. The columns, which generated a devoted following, critical acclaim and the 1979 Pulitzer for distinguished commentary, ended with his retirement in 1998.
To a generation of television watchers, he was also a familiar face as the host of "Masterpiece Theater" on PBS from 1993 to 2004, having succeeded Alistair Cooke.
Mr. Baker wrote 15 books, including many collections of his columns, and "Growing Up," a 1982 memoir of his Depression-era youth, his inspirational mother and America between the wars. It earned him his second Pulitzer, the 1983 prize for biography. Besides his two Pulitzer Prizes, he won two George Polk Awards, for commentary in 1978 and career achievement in 1998, and many other honors.
After his retirement from The Times, Mr. Baker wrote for The New York Review of Books on politics, history, journalism and other subjects. A collection of 11 of those essays, on revered public figures, was published in 2002 under the title "Looking Back."
Earlier, he wrote for Life, Look, Reader's Digest, The Saturday Evening Post, Ladies' Home Journal and other publications. From 1985 through 1994, he served on the Columbia University Pulitzer Prize board, selecting winners of the nation's most prestigious awards in journalism, literature and the arts. He was its chairman in 1993 and 1994.
'Ballet in a Telephone Booth'
But it was as a columnist that Mr. Baker made his name. Based at first in Washington, he recalled that he had to feel his way in the new genre of spoof and jape. "Nobody knew what the column was going to be," he told the writer Nora Ephron. "I didn't. The Times didn't."
But soon he was doing what he called his "ballet in a telephone booth," creating in the confined space of 750 words satirical dialogues, parodies and burlesques of politicians and the whirling capital circus -- then stoking the fires of the antiwar and civil rights struggles of the 1960s and the Watergate scandal that forced President Richard M. Nixon from office in 1974.
That year, Mr. Baker moved from Washington to New York, and his column changed. His topics grew more varied, less tied to news events and more to the trappings of ordinary life. His writing, admirers said, matured into literature: an owlish wit, sometimes surreal, often absurdist, usually scouring dark corridors of paradox, always carried off with a subtext of good sense.
He wrote of Francisco Franco's dying and going straight to the New York Department of Motor Vehicles. In another column, a pseudonymous Sykes tells of awakening one day to find that he has someone else's feet. Sykes conceals the shame from his wife and colleagues. Doctors are no help. Finally he confides to an editor, who signs him to a three-book contract. The feet become television celebrities. Hollywood wants Sykes's life story for a Robert Redford movie.
In 1975, after The Times's food editor and restaurant critic Craig Claiborne reported in gastronomic detail on a $4,000 31-course epicurean repast for two, with wines, in Paris, Mr. Baker wrote "Francs and Beans," describing his own culinary triumph after coming home to find a note in the kitchen saying his wife had gone out.
"The meal opened with a 1975 Diet Pepsi served in a disposable bottle," he wrote. "Although its bouquet was negligible, its distinct metallic aftertaste evoked memories of tin cans one had licked experimentally in the first flush of childhood's curiosity." And on to a "pÃ¢tÃ© de fruites de nuts of Georgia": "A half-inch layer of creamy-style peanut butter is troweled onto a graham cracker, then half a banana is crudely diced and pressed firmly into the peanut butter and cemented in place as it were by a second graham cracker."
Two years later, he conceived "A Taxpayer's Prayer":
"O mighty Internal Revenue, who turneth the labor of man to ashes, we thank thee for the multitude of thy forms which thou has set before us and for the infinite confusion of thy commandments which multiplieth the fortunes of lawyer and accountant alike. ..."
His targets were legion: the Super Bowl, Miss America, unreadable menus, everything on television, trips with children, the jogging craze, the perils of buying a suit, loneliness and book-of-the-month clubs. He struck poses of despair that resonated with harried readers: of his endless effort to read Proust, of lacking the gene for resisting salesmen, of boredom with dull dirty books.
Stylistically, the "Observer" examined the American scene with plain phrases that echoed Twain as they skewered the pompous. But his voice could be haunting, as in a 1974 column on older poor people in a supermarket: "Staring at 90-cent peanut butter. Taking down an orange, looking for the price, putting it back."
"Old people at the supermarket are being crushed and nobody is even screaming," he wrote.

Full text: Although there have been approximately 100,000 media profiles of enthusiastic blue-collar Trump supporters in diners, the reality is that Donald Trump is extraordinarily unpopular. A recent Pew analysis found only one other modern president with such a low approval rating two years into his administration.
On the other hand, that president was Ronald Reagan, who went on to win re-election in a landslide. So some Trump boosters are suggesting their champion can repeat that performance. Can he?
No, he can't. And it's worth understanding why, both to assess current political prospects and to debunk the Reagan mythology still infesting U.S. conservatism.
Let's talk first about the Reagan story.
Reagan was indeed unpopular in January 1983, mainly because of the economic situation. Despite a huge tax cut in 1981 and a sharp rise in military spending, more than 10 percent of the labor force was unemployed.
Although many voters blamed Reagan for this economic distress, the truth was that it had little to do with his policies; it was, instead, the consequence of the Federal Reserve's attempts to bring down inflation, which had driven interest rates as high as 19 percent.
By mid-1982, however, the Fed had reversed course, sharply reducing rates. And these rate cuts eventually produced a huge housing boom, which in turn drove a rapid economic recovery.
Like the earlier slump, this boom had little to do with Reagan's policies, but voters gave him credit anyway. Unemployment was still fairly high -- more than 7 percent -- in November 1984, but what matters for elections is whether things are getting better or worse, not how good they are in absolute terms. And in 1983-84, unemployment fell fast, so Reagan won big.
How does this story compare with Trump's prospects now?
First of all, where Reagan was unpopular because of a weak economy, Trump is unpopular despite a strong economy. That is, he starts from a much lower baseline.
And there is no chance of a "morning in America"-type boom over the next two years.
For one thing, in 1983-84 America was able to grow very fast by taking up the huge amount of economic slack that had accumulated over the course of the double-dip recession from 1979 to 1982. Right now, with unemployment below 4 percent, it's not clear whether there's any economic slack at all. There's certainly not enough to allow the 7-plus percent growth rates in real personal income that prevailed in the run-up to the 1984 election.
Also, a housing boom driven by dramatic interest rate reductions was central to the rapid growth of Reagan's third and fourth year in office. (No, it wasn't all about the miraculous effects of tax cuts.)
But today's Fed can't -- literally can't -- deliver the kind of boost it did back then by bringing double-digit interest rates down to single-digit levels, because rates are already quite low. And with housing prices looking rather high, it's hard to imagine a huge surge looking forward.
Are there other ways that the economy might rescue Trump? What about the 2017 tax cut, which Trump said would be "rocket fuel" for the economy?
Well, by increasing the budget deficit, that cut probably gave the economy some stimulus, temporarily raising growth. But that effect is already fading out, and the economy would have been slowing down even without the extra drag created by the Trump shutdown. This doesn't necessarily mean that we'll have a recession soon, but we're almost surely looking at unimpressive growth at best.
But wasn't the tax cut supposed to increase long-run growth, by increasing business investment? Yes, it was -- but it isn't delivering on that promise. Corporations received huge tax breaks, but they mostly used the money to pay higher dividends and buy back stocks, not for investment. And even the modest rise in business investment that did take place in 2018 seems to have been driven by higher oil prices, not tax cuts.
So Donald Trump is no Ronald Reagan.
Actually, even Ronald Reagan was no Ronald Reagan. Although right-wing legend portrays his experience as proof of the magical power of tax cuts, the economy actually performed somewhat better under Bill Clinton, who raised taxes. (Although, to be fair, almost all Republicans seem to have managed to expunge that fact from their memories.)
Most of Reagan's political success reflected not fundamental economic achievement but good luck with the timing of the business cycle. And Trump almost certainly won't experience comparable luck.
Combine this lack of a strong economic upside over the next two years with Trump's extreme current unpopularity, and his chances for re-election -- if he even makes it to the end of his first term -- don't look too good. Which raises the question of what he and his party will do if defeat is staring them in the face.
I don't know the answer to that question, and if you aren't scared about how a cornered Trump might lash out, you haven't been paying attention.
What's clear, however, is that Trump and his allies are in a deep hole right now -- and the economy isn't going to dig them out of it.

Full text: CARACAS, Venezuela -- Members of the Venezuelan National Guard were detained in the capital early Monday, the military said, after online videos showed a group of soldiers pledging allegiance to an opposition leader seeking to oust President NicolÃ¡s Maduro.

The soldiers' apparent defiance at a military installation in the western Caracas neighborhood of Cotiza occurred days after opposition leaders offered amnesty to members of the armed forces who turned their backs on the government and helped establish a transitional government that would convene fair elections.
The opposition leaders have called for nationwide demonstrations on Wednesday, which they hope will show that their bid to replace Mr. Maduro has widespread support.
The United States and several governments in the region have backed the opposition's plan, but leaders of the movement acknowledge that getting the armed forces to flip will be the toughest hurdle.
"We need to appeal to their conscience and create incentives for them," said Juan AndrÃ©s MejÃ­a, an opposition lawmaker.
But creating incentives may not be enough if members of the military fear that any sign of disloyalty may carry face harsh consequences. On Monday, 27 people were detained after security forces surrounded the military installation, according to Diosdado Cabello, president of the Constituent Assembly, a legislative body packed with Maduro loyalists.
The service members who had participated in the uprising had been "neutralized, defeated and captured in record time," Mr. Cabello said. He added in a series of messages posted on Twitter that the men were "confessing details" and that they had turned on the government after being offered "villas and castles."
Venezuela's military said the rebellious soldiers had stockpiled weapons. "These subjects will face the full weight of the law," it said in a statement.
Neighbors reported hearing clashes at the military installation as nearby residents banged pots and pans, apparently in a show of support for the mutinous troops.
Diplomats and security analysts in Venezuela said they found the soldiers' actions on Monday morning puzzling. Some said the government may have staged a small act of defiance to justify taking extreme security measures ahead of Wednesday's protests -- and perhaps as a warning to any military groups that may be mulling switching sides.
Their skepticism was based on the hapless plan that the soldiers supposedly set in motion and the speed with which the government issued a detailed statement claiming that the plot had been quickly quashed.
Whatever the case, the events added to the tension palpable in the capital before the planned protests.
"What happened this morning is very dangerous for the opposition," said RocÃ­o San Miguel, a security analyst with deep knowledge of the country's armed forces. "The government will use it to its favor."
Ms. San Miguel said rank-and-file soldiers had been defecting from their bases in large numbers in recent weeks. Their salaries have become increasingly worthless amid soaring inflation.
Juan GuaidÃ³, the recently installed president of the National Assembly who is leading the effort to establish a transitional government, called the soldiers' actions "a show of the generalized feeling" in the armed forces after Mr. Maduro was sworn in for a second term, on Jan. 10.
His re-election in May was widely condemned as rigged, and the United States and several Latin American governments have said they do not consider him a legitimately elected leader.
"Our troops know that the chain of command is broken due to the usurpation of the presidency," Mr. GuaidÃ³ wrote on Twitter on Monday. "We don't want the security forces to split apart or clash, we want them to stand united on the side of the people, the Constitution and against the usurpation."
The country's Supreme Court, which is packed with Maduro loyalists, issued a ruling late Monday morning that called the current leaders of the National Assembly illegitimate.
The court warned that recent laws passed by the assembly, including one granting amnesty to members of the security forces who turn on the government, are unconstitutional.
The ruling appeared unlikely to have any practical effect. The court and members of the National Assembly have not recognized the legitimacy of each other's actions since the court sought to assume the powers of the lawmaking body in March 2017.
Mr. Maduro first came to power in a snap vote after the death in 2013 of President Hugo ChÃ¡vez, who anointed him as his successor. Over the years, Mr. Maduro has tightened his grip on power, and unrest within the armed forces has grown. Dozens of Venezuelan military officers have been detained in recent months on suspicion of plotting coups.
As residents in the area of the uprising awoke to the sound of clashes, many took to the streets to support the rebelling troops, according to videos posted online. Seeking to keep protests from growing, security officers fired tear gas, according to residents.
The beginning of Mr. Maduro's new term drew an international outcry that has left the Venezuelan government more isolated than ever before. It also invigorated the opposition, which had appeared rudderless and largely ineffectual since a wave of protests in 2017 was crushed by the security forces.
Opposition leaders have convened town-hall-style meetings across Venezuela to build support for their vision of a transitional government. Those meetings have been attended by thousands of people. Some have been held in poor districts that have traditionally been bedrocks of support for Mr. Maduro's party.

Full text: BEIJING -- In the vast metropolis of Chongqing in western China, three huge Ford Motor assembly plants have slowed to a fraction of their earlier pace.
In the eastern province of Jiangsu, hundreds of chemical factories have closed.
In Guangdong Province in the southeast, factories have idled workers in droves.
China's huge economy, a major driver of global growth, is cooling just when the world needs its spark. On Monday, Chinese officials said that, during the last three months of 2018, the economy grew at its slowest pace since the global financial crisis.
It is happening at a difficult time. The broader world outlook is beginning to dim. The American economy, which has powered ahead in recent years with strong growth and low unemployment, is showing some signs of a slowdown and is facing higher short-term interest rates that could act as a brake. Europe's resurgence is beginning to show its age, too, with even Germany's industrial engine starting to sputter.
In the past, China has helped the world out of such weak spots, most notably during the global financial crisis. But this time, its economy is showing pronounced weakness.
Car sales have plunged in China since last summer. Smartphone sales are falling. The real estate market has stagnated, with deeply indebted developers forced to pay steep interest rates to roll over their debts. And trade frictions with the West, coupled with tough policies from Beijing toward foreign investors, have made Chinese and foreign companies alike warier of further investment in China.
"European investment in China is going down," Cecilia MalmstrÃ¶m, the European Union's commissioner of trade, said during an interview in Washington. "That is more because it is becoming increasingly complicated to do business there, with the forced technology transfer, with the lack of transparency, discrimination as compared to Chinese companies, with the massive subsidies of state-owned companies."
For the heads of state and corporate leaders gathering this week in Davos, Switzerland, for the World Economic Forum, the Chinese economy could be the most pressing issue, even among the trade fights and political uncertainty plaguing the rest of the world.
China on Monday said its economy grew 6.4 percent during the last three months of 2018 compared with the same time in 2017. For all of 2018, China's economy grew 6.6 percent, the slowest pace since 1990, though many economists believe the country's headline figures are unreliable.
Previous slowdowns in China, like the one in 2015 and 2016, unnerved investors and global business leaders alike, setting off worries that multinational companies would lose profits from their Chinese subsidiaries, or that Chinese companies would dump their surplus production on world markets at very low prices.
Apple surprised markets this month when it warned of weaker-than-expected demand for its iPhones in China. Ford Motor cut output at its Chongqing joint venture by 70 percent in November, in what Ford says was a move to reduce inventories of unsold cars. Chemical industry experts said that mostly Chinese-owned chemical factories in Jiangsu had been shutting down because of weak demand and stricter environmental enforcement.
The question now is to what extent nervous business leaders elsewhere will postpone investment as China slows, and how many investors will dump their shareholdings.
"The global economy and financial markets are incredibly sensitive to China's growth and currency outlook," said Robin Brooks, the chief economist at the Washington-based Institute of International Finance. "The immediate financial linkages are relatively modest, but they are swamped by sentiment channels."
To be sure, further slowing in China is not the only risk the global economy faces. A disorderly British exit from the European Union or a financial crisis in debt-ridden Italy could also be unsettling. In the United States, the national debt is rising and the stimulus from large tax cuts may start to wear off by next year. The Federal Reserve could keep raising interest rates to keep inflation at bay, making it more expensive to borrow money, though it isn't clear exactly what the American central bank will do.
Still, the big question now is, to paraphrase the line about Las Vegas: Will what happens in China stay in China, or will it become a global problem?
The World Bank aptly titled its review of this year's outlook "Darkening Prospects." It warned that China's slowdown could affect countries that export a great deal to it.
China is the world's second-largest importer, after the United States. But the composition of its imports is unusual.
It is the largest market for a long list of commodity exporters, from Australia to Uruguay, thanks to its voracious appetite for iron ore, food, energy and other raw materials it needs to keep its economy humming. China is also a large market for factory equipment made in countries like Germany and Japan.
But its imports of manufactured goods overall are few for an economy of its size. That has limited the dependence of workers elsewhere, particularly in the United States, on the Chinese economy.
The global impact of the Chinese slowdown now underway could be limited if Beijing decides to borrow and spend its way into more growth. Already this month, China has issued a series of announcements approving six municipal subway construction projects and three new intercity rail lines, at a combined cost of $148 billion.
"The weaker the data gets, the more confident we get that they'll tip a lot of stimulus into keeping the economy moving," said Michael Blythe, the chief economist at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia in Sydney.
Many of the biggest new construction projects are in China's western regions, said Wang Min, the chairman of Xuzhou Construction Machinery Group, a state-owned giant. The projects have been good for his company, China's largest producer of huge earth-moving equipment, and its orders have soared in recent months.
But linking together towns in sparsely populated areas of mountains and deserts is expensive. It adds large sums to China's already very high levels of debt. And the investment may produce scant new economic activity to pay off that extra debt.
Previously accumulated debt lies at the heart of a one-two punch that has laid China's overall economy low in recent months.
Vice Premier Liu He promised at Davos a year ago that China would rein in the growth of credit within three years. Chinese officials were confident at the time that they could head off a trade war with the United States.
They set about putting stringent limits on the country's extensive shadow banking networks. Those networks had been providing a gusher of loans to the country's small and midsize enterprises, which China's big, state-owned banks have long neglected in favor of lending to state-owned enterprises.
But by the end of April, as the economy started slowing, Chinese officials started to say that three years was not enough time. As credit dried up and many private sector businesses started running low on cash, top regulators expressed worry at a Shanghai financial conference in June that they might have already gone too far.
At the same time, momentum was building in Beijing to extend the influence of the Communist Party and state-owned enterprises, mainly at the expense of the private sector. The private sector is responsible for most job creation in China, and the rhetoric from Beijing further scared investors.
Less than a month after the Shanghai conference, the trade war began in earnest. President Trump imposed the first of three tranches of tariffs on imports from China. Corporate executives say that by the time the third tranche hit in late September, consumer confidence was crumbling. Purchases of big-ticket goods, especially cars, fell fast.
Business confidence slumped as well. A survey of 270 importers in the United States conducted in late December and early January by Panjiva, a trade data service, found that 71 percent planned to change how and where they bought their goods if tariffs stayed unchanged. And 87 percent said they would do so if the Trump administration raised tariffs further.
As companies start moving their supply chains, the main beneficiaries seem to be Southeast Asian nations like Vietnam and Indonesia. But to the extent that those countries buy more factory equipment from places like Germany, some of the negative effects overseas from weaker sales in China could be offset.
Most economists are predicting that the first quarter of this year will be weak in China. Many are predicting that the second will be, too.
But quite a few say they still have confidence in China's consistent, four-decade track record of pulling itself out of slumps quickly. Chinese officials have put new emphasis in recent weeks on rebuilding confidence. And they are at least trying to reassure private companies that the government will not favor state-owned enterprises over them.
"As long as we can create a level playing field," said Ma Jiantang, a senior economic adviser to China's cabinet, "private companies will surely succeed."

Stocks' U-Turn All but Erases Losses of 2018

Full text: Stocks have staged a remarkable turnaround in the early days of 2019, rebounding after an end-of-the-year tailspin that was fomented by fears of recession in the United States.
Three straight weeks of gains in the new year on Wall Street have erased nearly all of 2018's losses. It's the best start to a year since 1987.
Even so, many factors behind last year's troubling decline remain unresolved. American companies and consumers are less optimistic about the future, and large economies like Germany and China are signaling a global slowdown driven by the trade war. Britain is in turmoil over leaving the European Union. And a new concern, the longest federal government shutdown in history, also poses a risk to the domestic economy.
A month ago, any one of those elements might have fueled a steep decline in stocks. In December, waves of panic-driven selling left the S&P 500 dangling almost 20 percent below its high. Now, it's all being taken in stride.
The difference is an abrupt change in tone from the Federal Reserve. This year began with repeated public assurances from Fed officials that they were sensitive to concerns about the economy and would be patient and flexible as they decided whether to raise interest rates.
Investors were alarmed last year by the idea that the central bank was determined to keep raising rates, risking a recession. It wasn't just Wall Street that worried. As stocks were sliding in December, President Trump, who boasted about stocks as they rose earlier in the year, became fixated on the Fed and its chairman, Jerome H. Powell. "The only problem our economy has is the Fed," he wrote on Twitter on Dec. 24.
"They're trying their best to be a source of stability in markets," said Samantha Azzarello, global market strategist at J. P. Morgan Asset Management. "What happened last year really shook people and their confidence in investing in equities."
The Fed has always held sway over the financial markets, but that influence tends to grow in the later stages of an expansion, when every interest rate increase is seen as the one that might trip up the economy.
The United States economy is still strong: The unemployment rate is near 50-year lows, wages are starting to rise and growth in corporate profits remains robust. To the Fed, these are reasons to keep raising borrowing costs and stave off potential inflation. It did so four times in 2018.
But after 10 years of economic growth, many investors are worried that a turning point is near, and that higher interest rates might bring on a slowdown faster than they expect. And the recent stock market gains may not stick without proof that corporate profits can keep growing.
"We're in a bit of a 'show me' moment for skeptical and uncertain investors," said Kate Moore, chief equity strategist for BlackRock, the world's largest investment firm. "It's going to have to be backed up with earnings and the confidence that those earnings are going to be sustainable."
This past week, American companies began disclosing their sales and profits for the fourth quarter. With about 10 percent of companies in the S&P 500 posting results, the reports have been strong.
After the S&P 500 rose 2.9 percent in the week through Friday, it is up 13.6 percent from its Dec. 24 low. The stock index ended trading on Friday just below its 2018 starting point.
However, earnings reports reflect only what happened in the past. When it comes to how they will do in 2019, some large businesses have cautioned that they don't have a clear view.
Ford recently warned that the trade war and Britain's impending exit from the European Union made it impossible to offer investors a forecast. The homebuilder Lennar did the same, blaming weakness and uncertainty in the housing market.
Broad surveys of sentiment also suggest reason for worry. On Friday, the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index fell to the lowest point of the Trump presidency and well below forecasters' expectations. Earlier in the week, a report from the Fed showed that, through early January, executives and economists had become less optimistic for a host of reasons, including trade and political uncertainty and swings in the financial markets.
The data in that report came before the government shutdown had stretched to nearly a month. Now the longest in United States history, the closing will start to take a toll. The latest estimates from the White House's own Council of Economic Advisers suggest that the shutdown has already knocked almost half a percentage point off the economy's growth rate, though that drag should end once the government reopens.
The shutdown is affecting some large businesses already. On Tuesday, Delta Air Lines cautioned that reduced travel by government officials and contractors would hurt its sales growth, at a rate of about $25 million a month. JPMorgan Chase executives noted that if the Securities and Exchange Commission -- currently closed except for emergency matters -- was not able to give approvals for stock market share offerings, and mergers went unapproved by other government agencies, it could cut fee revenue for its investment banking operations.
Profits at American companies may be hurt by the United States' trade war with China. Evidence that it is slowing global growth mounted this past week, with Germany reporting its slowest annual growth rate since 2013 and China saying that exports fell last month.
Companies in the S&P 500 generate 37 percent of their sales, on average, from markets outside the United States, according to the data provider FactSet, and businesses that have increased their exposure to global economies now look vulnerable.
But for the most part, stock investors have shrugged off these concerns in January, now that they see the Fed as less eager to raise rates.
The Fed had spooked investors as recently as Dec. 19, when it raised interest rates, and its chairman, Mr. Powell, said he didn't see a need for the central bank to change the way it has been slowly selling off the bonds it bought to bolster the economy over the last decade. The stock market slid 6 percent in the days afterward.
"Clearly the market was skittish about, primarily, the Fed," said Alicia Levine, chief strategist at BNY Mellon Investment Management. "It sounded like the Fed was on autopilot."
By Jan. 4, Mr. Powell's comments had a different tone. Speaking at a public panel discussion, he made a point of emphasizing the Fed's ability to be patient with further interest rate increases, given that inflation remains low.
"We're listening with, you know, sensitively to the message that -- that markets are sending," Mr. Powell said. "And we're going to be taking those downside risks into account as we make policy going forward."
Within days, other central bank officials repeated the sentiment, and the Fed published the details of its December meeting, which showed that many of its policymakers had already reached that conclusion. Stocks had already bounced off their Christmas Eve low when Mr. Powell spoke, but have gained 9.1 percent since.
"Their commentary has really done a 180 in a really short period of time," said David Giroux, chief investment officer of United States equity at asset manager T. Rowe Price.
Over the last 30 years, investors have grown accustomed to looking to the Fed for help when the market found itself in a sticky spot. Some trace the phenomenon to the October 1987 market crash. The morning after stocks tumbled roughly 20 percent in a single day, the Fed, under the recently appointed Alan Greenspan, issued a statement indicating that it was ready to support the economic and financial system.
Stocks rebounded sharply, helping to embed an expectation into the markets that continues today. And, in the past decade, as stocks have climbed in their longest run of gains ever, the Fed's decisions to back away from plans to raise interest rates or withdraw economic stimulus have helped keep the bull market alive.
Mr. Powell and the Fed seem to have done that again.
"I think his comments on Jan. 4 were critical to getting excitement and willingness to invest back into the market," Ms. Levine said.

Full text: Verla Bloomfield has the kind of workplace that seems plucked from a different era. She has a pension, a union, several weeks of vacation and a paycheck that has nearly doubled in 14 years. Her employer? The United States government.
"People used to work for companies their whole life and retire and take their pension and move on," said Ms. Bloomfield, who handles claims for the Social Security Administration in Tulsa, Okla. "That's not the reality of our work force anymore, but it still is for the federal government."
By many measures, the last couple of decades scorched American workers. Wages crawled up, factory jobs fled to China and benefits collapsed. But those years look less painful if you worked for Uncle Sam.
Since 2000, average pay has grown twice as fast for federal employees as it has in the private sector. That's partly because the federal work force has become more educated and specialized. It is also built into the job. Even without the salaries that top performers can command in the corporate world, government workers who do well are entitled by law to regular pay increases, an increasingly rare guarantee elsewhere.
"It has been a really key route to the middle class," said Heidi Shierholz, an economist with the Economic Policy Institute in Washington. "These are jobs in a highly unionized sector, where people see decent benefits, decent job security, decent wage growth over time."
While raises have slowed in recent years, these jobs are still often the best around. Eight in 10 are outside of the Beltway. And the paychecks -- which have stopped arriving during the longest United States government shutdown ever -- are increasingly critical to local economies.
That is especially true in places that are remote and have high jobless rates, like Pocahontas County, W.Va. "Natural resources abound, but job opportunities don't," said Cynthia Sandeno, a district ranger with the United States Forest Service, who oversees hundreds of thousands of acres of woodlands in the area.
Ms. Sandeno, 44, manages 25 wildlife ecologists, biologists, engineers and foresters who make anywhere from $28,000 to $100,000 a year, which puts many of them at the top of the local pay scale. Their missing checks will very likely be felt far beyond their own bank accounts.
Ms. Sandeno says that since they were furloughed, her staff members stopped eating out at the Dirtbean cafe or Rayetta's Lunch Box in Marlinton, a town of 1,000. "They are just normal people who don't want to file for unemployment," she says. There aren't a lot of alternatives in the area.
"It's 45 miles to the closest McDonald's," she said. The shutdown also derailed Ms. Sandeno's plan to make two job offers to local residents and promote one of her employees.
"Those are three families that would be getting above-average pay," she said.
As globalization has shuttered factories and decimated entire industries, federal employment has been a bastion of stability. It has not grown, and occupies a shrinking share of the overall labor market, but it remains an equalizer for African-Americans and women, who are far more likely to earn high salaries working for the government than they would with a company.
The work force includes most of the occupations found in the private sector -- as varied as janitors and accountants -- with salaries that span the lowest and highest ends of the economy. The ranks include Veterans Health Administration pharmacy technicians in Mississippi earning $43,000 a year, and lawyers for the Securities and Exchange Commission in Washington pulling down $200,000.
Federal employees on average earn higher salaries than private sector workers, partly because they are far more likely to have advanced degrees, and they're older. The government has also outsourced many low-paying positions -- landscapers and security guards, for example -- to contractors, who number in the millions.
Unions representing the workers point out that Congress has not lifted federal employees' pay enough to keep up with inflation in recent years.
If you got an entry-level job today processing tax returns at the Internal Revenue Service in Ogden, Utah, for example, you would earn $29,847 in salary. That's less than you would have made in 2011, after inflation. The decline is partly because of a three-year federal salary freeze under President Barack Obama starting in 2011, followed by 1 percent raises for four years.
"People are worse off than they were at the beginning of the decade," said Jacqueline Simon, the policy director of the American Federation of Government Employees, a union representing 700,000 workers.
But the reality is that people who have held onto their government jobs for many years have not languished in the same role at the same pay grade. They have progressed up the ladder and benefited from regular raises at least every few years. They all have pensions and almost all have health insurance, perks that are harder to come by as an employee in corporate America.
When Ms. Bloomfield, 55, started at the Social Security office in Tulsa in 2005, she made $40,000. Then, over the next decade or so, she climbed four levels in the ranks of the federal work force. "Those were big pay jumps," she said. In 2017, Ms. Bloomfield got a promotion that put her salary at $78,000 a year, a comfortable sum in Tulsa.
Unions and conservative groups often argue whether people like Ms. Bloomfield are overpaid or undercompensated. Many of those at the high end of the scale could command even bigger salaries on Wall Street or in Silicon Valley -- and estimates that break down pay by occupation have shown that the government pays less than companies do for similar work.
Ms. Bloomfield would take stability over a six-figure salary in the private sector any day. Her brother earns much more than she does in technical support in Austin, Tex. But he's had to switch employers multiple times in the last 20 years because of corporate restructuring and layoffs.
"Even though he makes a high wage, he has to live with this uncertainty," she said. "We don't have that stress."
Steve Fosse, a revenue agent with the I.R.S., isn't sure whether that trade-off is worth it anymore. The first person in his family to graduate from college, Mr. Fosse, 39, took a job with the government because it offered reliability. "I wanted the benefits and the guaranteed paychecks," he said.
For the most part, that dream panned out. Mr. Fosse earns $90,000 a year, a comfortable sum that helped him buy a four-bedroom home in West Fargo, N.D. He doesn't exactly indulge in luxuries -- his newest car is a used Toyota Sienna that has logged 170,000 miles -- but he hasn't lost much sleep over where his next few paychecks will come from. Until now.
Mr. Fosse is furloughed and has begun selling everything he can -- an old television, a stationary bicycle, a snow blower -- on Craigslist. He's mulling a move to a public accounting firm in Minneapolis, where his rÃ©sumÃ© could probably land him a salary above $120,000. He'd miss his pension, and the feeling that he's doing something that, on balance, helps people.
But 14 years into his career, he's having doubts.
"It's nice to be able to serve the United States," he said, "but I don't like feeling like I am getting pushed to a bread line in order to continue doing that."

Full text: CARACAS, Venezuela -- Leaders of Venezuela's opposition on Tuesday set in motion a plan to try to oust President NicolÃ¡s Maduro and create a caretaker government until new elections can be held.
The National Assembly, the opposition-controlled legislative body, declared Mr. Maduro illegitimate, hoping to trigger a constitutional mechanism that would allow the head of the assembly to take over the leadership.
It was not immediately clear what effect the move would have or how Mr. Maduro's government would react.
Rafael Chavero, professor of constitutional law at the Central University of Venezuela, said the next steps were not clear. "You have to think outside the box," he said. "There is no magic formula to get out of dictatorships."
The National Assembly has been largely powerless since Venezuela's Supreme Court, which is packed by Maduro loyalists, attempted to dissolve it in March 2017.
But pressure has been mounting on Mr. Maduro, both domestically and abroad, since he was sworn in for his second term last week. Not long after the ceremony, an opposition leader, Juan GuaidÃ³, the head of the National Assembly, said he would be ready to take over as president and hold fair elections if Venezuelans and the armed forces backed him.
On Tuesday, Vice President Mike Pence spoke with Mr. GuaidÃ³ on the phone to recognize "his courageous leadership" and to "express the United States' resolute support for the National Assembly of Venezuela as the only legitimate democratic body in the country," according to a statement from the office of the vice president.
Earlier, on Twitter, Mr. Pence said the United States "strongly supports the courageous decision by Juan GuaidÃ³" to "declare the country's presidency vacant."
Mr. GuaidÃ³ has also received support from Luis Almagro, the secretary general of the Organization of American States, who called him the country's "interim president."
The expressions of support have emboldened those opposition leaders who remain in Venezuela -- and who have not been imprisoned -- to pursue the high-stakes plan to try to oust Mr. Maduro. They have extended an olive branch to the security forces in the hope that enough middle- and low-level members break ranks, and that Mr. Maduro loses a critical pillar of support.
Until recent days, the National Assembly had been regarded as ineffectual, and led by politicians who had lost popular support as their efforts to challenge Mr. Maduro faltered repeatedly. It was also stymied by divisions in its ranks and a ruthless security apparatus that has jailed critics and opponents, tortured hundreds of suspected dissidents and foiled rebellions within the security forces.
But longtime Venezuela watchers say this challenge to the president comes at a time of unprecedented opposition to Mr. Maduro.
"It's almost a now-or-never moment," said Fernando Cutz, a former senior White House official who helped shape Venezuela policy under the Trump and Obama administrations.
The country's authoritarian president was inaugurated for a second term amid a collapsing economy and a growing humanitarian crisis. As inflation has soared and food and medicine have become acutely scarce, Venezuelans have been fleeing their nation in droves. As of last November, more than three million people had left, according to the United Nations.
Ahead of Mr. Maduro's inauguration, a group of countries that includes Canada, Colombia, Brazil, Peru and Argentina issued a statement calling Mr. Maduro's second term "illegitimate" and his government "dictatorial and oppressive."
Mr. GuaidÃ³, 35, has stopped short of calling himself the nation's rightful leader. But the day after Mr. Maduro's second swearing-in, Mr. GuaidÃ³ invoked an article of Venezuela's Constitution that transfers power to the president of the National Assembly in the event that the presidency becomes vacant.
Mr. GuaidÃ³ was not a household name at home or abroad before he was sworn in as the new leader of the National Assembly on Jan. 5. But on Sunday, his profile rose dramatically after masked agents from Venezuela's intelligence service took him into custody.
The men grabbed him at gunpoint and hustled him into a car -- but seemed unsure what to do once they had him, Mr. GuaidÃ³ told The Times in an interview.
They questioned him on his plans to assume the country's leadership and call a new election, and then let him go, Mr. GuaidÃ³ said on Monday from the plain office that serves as the headquarters of his political party, Popular Will.
"They asked me if we were serious people, and I said that of course, that we could protect the Venezuelan people and that Maduro could not do it," Mr. GuaidÃ³ said.
He said he had assured the men "there would be amnesty for all those who support us." Some of them removed their masks, saying, "Look at our faces and don't forget us," he said.
Then they let him go.
While that exchange cannot be independently confirmed, the fact that Mr. GuaidÃ³ was released may indicate cracks in the security apparatus that has kept Mr. Maduro in power until now. It helped bolster opposition leaders' belief that they stand a good chance of seizing power from Mr. Maduro and holding a new election.
"We are certain that we are taking the proper steps not to merely declare, but to execute" a peaceful transition of power, Mr. GuaidÃ³ said. "I think it is underway."
The key would be to persuade those who remain loyal to the government that they can switch allegiances and help rebuild a country devastated by an economic meltdown, acute food and medicine shortages and rampant violence, he said.
Venezuela's communications minister, Jorge RodrÃ­guez, called the detention of Mr. GuaidÃ³ a rogue operation that had not been ordered by the government. He said the men who carried it out had been "dismissed" and would be punished.
In the wake of Mr. GuaidÃ³'s detention, Mr. Maduro dismissed his political rivals, saying they have long sought to seize power through "adventure, improvisation, coups." Their plan, he said, was destined to fail.
"Here the people of Venezuela will continue to rule with NicolÃ¡s Maduro at the head of the presidency of the country," Mr. Maduro said in remarks to the Constituent Assembly.
Mr. GuaidÃ³ is an industrial engineer who got his start in politics through activism in student movements. He was a protÃ©gÃ© of Leopoldo LÃ³pez, a prominent opposition leader who was jailed during street protests in 2014 and is currently under house arrest in Caracas.
Mr. GuaidÃ³ is cleareyed about the risks he is taking, he said. He still bears scars from being shot with rubber bullets during street protests last year.
"Anyone who gets involved in opposition efforts today can fare very poorly," he said.
Mr. GuaidÃ³ has called on Venezuelans to take to the streets on Jan. 23 for mass demonstrations backing his bid to remove Mr. Maduro.
In recent months, opposition leaders have struggled to organize large, sustained demonstrations amid skepticism by Venezuelans that the opposition can bring about change. Many also fear the increasingly brutal reprisals of the security forces.
Mr. Cutz, the former White House official, said he feared that the opposition could emerge severely weakened if it failed to get people to protest in large numbers.
"If Maduro emerges victorious, then I feel like we are left with a relatively high likelihood of Venezuela ending up like Cuba," he said. "This will become the status quo, and everyone will kind of accept it."

Once 'Mother's Ruin,' Gin Now Lures Hipsters

Full text: LONDON -- Ever since European apothecaries began distilling gin and selling it as a cure-all in the 16th century, the juniper-flavored liquor has been revered as a medicine, vilified for fueling public disorder and consumed in a multitude of every-season cocktails.
Now, it is stirring up a specialized tourist trade in the homeland of London dry gin thanks in part to entrepreneurial bottling and branding.
After surging for a decade, gin sales in Britain reached nearly 2 billion pounds, or about $2.6 billion, in Britain through last fall, compared with Â£1.26 billion for the same period in 2017, according to the Wine and Spirit Trade Association. Drinkers of pink and flavored versions have helped make it the country's second-most-popular spirit, ahead of whiskeys and behind only vodka, the group said.
Gin has gotten so popular in Britain that the country's Office for National Statistics added it back to the basket of goods it uses to measure inflation after a 13-year absence.
Many of the newer products share the flavor of juniper, but others vary widely from traditional dry gin, which, by European law, must be distilled from natural plant materials and have a minimum of 37.5 percent alcohol by volume.
The revival has spawned gin-flavored marmalade and gin-scented candles, prompting fears of overkill among some British producers. As a result, they are seeking new growth overseas.
The birth of a new boom
Sam Galsworthy and Fairfax Hall, childhood friends from Britain, were working in the beverage industry in the United States in the early 2000s and watching microbreweries and craft distilleries multiply around them.
They set about starting a gin distillery in West London in 2007, but were quickly stymied by bureaucratic rules stretching back more than 250 years.
In 1751, British officials, worried that too many people were succumbing to so-called mother's ruin, passed the Gin Act to stamp out small-scale and home production by limiting gin making to stills with a capacity of at least 1,800 liters.
Mr. Galsworthy and Mr. Hall lobbied the government to ease the restriction, and in 2009, their company, Sipsmith, was granted a license to produce gin. The move opened the door for other small distilleries.
Gin making has exploded in Britain since then. The number of distilleries grew to 419 in 2018 from 113 in 2009, according to the Office for National Statistics.
The distilleries have become popular tourist destinations. Sipsmith says it gets about 25,000 visitors a year. Taste-testers like that -- those buying the experience as well as the gin -- have helped fuel the growth in sales.
"It's part of a food culture that probably didn't exist in the U.K. 20 years ago," said Miles Beale, chief executive of Britain's Wine and Spirit Trade Association. "People are drinking less, but they're more interested in what they're drinking. They will spend money on it."
The benefit of a good back story
Ian Puddick was renovating the London building that housed his plumbing business in 2013 when he discovered that it was once home to a bakery where illicit gin was made.
He tracked down the owners' descendants, and although they didn't give him a recipe, they identified several ingredients. With that and some guesswork, he came up with Old Bakery Gin, which is now sold at Harrods and Fortnum & Mason.
Mr. Puddick's tale is one of many origin stories whetting the appetite of the new generation of gin connoisseurs. Oscar Dodd, a Fortnum & Mason buyer, said shoppers often wanted to learn more about the provenance or ingredients of their purchases.
"They're nearly all looking for something new and exciting," he said. "There's a social currency with gin. You want to introduce your friends."
Still, the proliferation of new gins is a challenge for relative neophytes like Mr. Puddick.
"That brand loyalty, getting people to choose your brand above others, is definitely getting tougher," he said.
A heavyweight sticks to the basics
Beefeater, a London staple since the 1800s, is sticking to basics even as rivals keep sprouting up. If the rise of sloe gin and snow globes with gin bottles leads to consumer fatigue, the company wants to make sure its product remains the main ingredient in gin-based cocktails.
"Gin is designed to work in many different directions," Desmond Payne, Beefeater's master distiller, said. "Very few people drink gin on its own. Gin should have the ability to be versatile and work in different directions."
Beefeater welcomes the industry's growth and has even produced some limited editions of new blends. Still, Mr. Payne is wary of making something too different from the product that the company sells 2.9 million nine-liter cases of a year.
The risk with some of the experimental gins that have emerged, Mr. Payne said, is that "they're too much about one particular thing," limiting their ability to work well in all types of cocktails.
'It's both grown-up and hipster'
Mr. Galsworthy of Sipsmith expects the gin boom to stall at some point. "Make no bones about it," he said, "the proliferation of it endangers the category in of itself."
He and other distillers are looking beyond Britain for new customers, sometimes getting snapped up by big alcohol companies that hope to capitalize on a global gin market that, according to the research firm Euromonitor, grew to about $15.5 billion in 2017 from about $10.5 billion in 2007.
In 2016, Sipsmith was acquired by Beam Suntory, which has also acquired Japanese and Spanish gins. Diageo, which owns popular brands like Gordon's and Tanqueray, added a Japanese-inspired gin to its offering.
Smaller entrants from other parts of the world are also getting into the market.
Dragon's Blood Gin has just started making gin in a custom-built distillery in Inner Mongolia, China. Peddlers Gin, a Shanghai brand, recently signed an international distribution deal. And new distilleries are popping up from Australia to Liechtenstein to the United States, said Nicholas Cook, the director of the Gin Guild in Britain.
Gin's appeal, he said, is that "it's both grown-up and hipster at the same time."
Joseph Judd, who helped found Peddlers Gin, said even as the company sought to increase its global reach, especially in Asia, it was hewing to the liquor's European heritage.
"I think it would be difficult to come with purely Chinese ingredients and disregard the British perspective," Mr. Judd said. "With gin, you have to respect the process and the history."

Full text: After rising for nine years in a so-so economy in the belief that prosperity was just around the corner, stocks swooned, even as growth picked up.
That left many investors wondering whether the economy is turning another corner into a place where danger, maybe even a recession and a prolonged bear market, lurk.
The S&P 500 dropped 13.5 percent during the fourth quarter, including dividends, giving the index a 4.4 percent loss for the year by that measure. It was the worst performance since 2008, despite strong corporate earnings and the best readings in several decades in unemployment and consumer confidence.
As 2019 unfolds and the economic picture becomes clearer, it is possible that stocks will have a sustained, orderly recovery, investment advisers say. But achieving that clarity will take time, so they encourage investors to demand a lot of evidence that a recession will be avoided before they commit money to stocks or other risky assets.
"A lot of the derating that happened in the second half of 2018 started off being driven by political risk, but in the last few weeks, it has been driven by concerns about growth and stability," said Kate Moore, chief equity strategist at BlackRock, referring to the decline in stocks. "I think that's going to go on in the first few weeks of 2019. Everyone's focused on economic data."
Ms. Moore highlighted surveys showing weaker-than-expected business conditions and added: "It's going to take time for that to work itself through the market. I would expect more volatility as we take in new data points."
Just how weak those data points are likely to be is hard to predict.
"The underlying fundamentals of the economy certainly have deteriorated," said Edward Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research. He noted that the five monthly regional business surveys conducted by Federal Reserve districts "were all extremely weak in December."
But the latest employment report was not. It showed 312,000 net jobs created last month.
"We have a very mixed economic picture right now," Mr. Yardeni said. "It all adds up to an economy that's slowing but probably still growing." If that's true, then 2019 may not be so bad for the market.
"Stocks are very cheap, with one important qualification," he said: "You have to believe the economy is not going to wind up in recession."
He then offered another qualification, about forthcoming corporate earnings reports: "We still have to curb our enthusiasm because we can't get too excited about the earnings outlook."
The tax cuts that took effect in 2018 sent earnings up so much for the year -- the latest estimate for the S&P 500 was 20.2 percent, according to FactSet Research -- that a 5 percent rise in earnings in 2019, aided by corporate buybacks, is about as much as Wall Street can expect, Mr. Yardeni said. FactSet's latest forecast is for a 7.3 percent increase.
Despite some good days for the market in January that may have been prompted by signs of flexibility from the Federal Reserve, the way stocks tumbled late in the year hardly inspires confidence. With anything like a repeat performance, investors will have to hope that other assets provide better protection than in 2018, when there were few places to hide.
"Cash was the only major asset class that posted positive returns in '18," according to a Bank of America report. Even the reed-thin 1.9 percent return on cash in money market funds was less than the 2.2 percent consumer inflation rate, the report said, but at least it was a positive number. Long-term government bonds, corporate bonds and gold all lost ground, although they beat the return of the S&P 500. Oil and foreign stocks were among the investments that did worse.
The average domestic stock fund lost 14.2 percent in the fourth quarter, with specialists in natural resources, technology and financial services leading the way down. These funds dropped 6.8 percent during the year, according to Morningstar. International stock funds outperformed during the quarter, losing 10.9 percent, but trailed badly for the full year, down 13.2 percent.
Bond funds lost 0.9 percent in the quarter and 1 percent for all of 2018. High-yield portfolios were particularly weak, off 4.6 percent for the quarter and 2.8 percent for the year.
Such across-the-board weakness is rare "because what tends to be bad for one asset tends to be good for some other asset somewhere," said Ben Inker, head of asset allocation for the investment firm GMO. "The basic exception is when there is a combination of rising rates and slowing growth. Risky assets don't like slowing growth, and fixed income doesn't like rising rates."
Mr. Inker, like many, is worried that the Fed could push a fragile economy into recession. That would be "fairly ugly for valuations" of American stocks, he said, and he would avoid them even if he were confident that a recession could be skirted. He prefers stocks and bonds in emerging markets, which are much cheaper than their counterparts in mature economies.
"We're reasonably bullish on our ability to make money in 2019, just not in the assets most people have most of their money in," he said.
One reason for the poor returns on stocks, especially in December, is that the Fed initially had not seemed to share the fear felt on Wall Street. When the Fed raised its target for short-term interest rates last month, the move was almost universally anticipated, but the statement about economic conditions and monetary policy made after the increase "was not as dovish as the market was hoping for," said Steve Kane, a bond fund manager at TCW.
Recent data "signals an economic slowdown," and not just in the United States, Mr. Kane said. Surveys "confirm a significant drop in manufacturing activity. There are also signals that growth in China is slowing dramatically and significantly," he said.
The flattening yield curve, with short-term interest rates approaching long-term rates, is consistent with an economy that is running out of steam, and a source of concern in itself. But recent remarks by Jerome H. Powell, the Federal Reserve chairman, that the central bank will have "patience" in deciding whether to raise rates, appeared to cheer the markets.
If rates are priced for a slowdown, some corporate bonds are not, Mr. Kane said. At least not yet. Spreads in yields between corporate and government debt have widened, taking bond prices down. Medium-term investment-grade corporate issues yielded 1.76 percentage points more than equivalent Treasury paper, as of Tuesday, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, and an index of high-yield debt yielded 4.65 points more. A two-point cushion is roughly where investment-grade spreads tend to peak during a slowdown, but high-yield spreads typically soar to 10 points.
"One should look at the fixed-income market as being more attractive to invest in 2019 than 2018, but one must still invest with some degree of caution, especially in the high-yield market," he said. "There will be better opportunities later in the year" in high yield, while "there is not too much downside to investment-grade credit at this point." He called it "a fairly good asset class if we're in the midst of a bear market in equities."
Stocks that Ms. Moore at BlackRock thinks would do comparatively well against such a backdrop are of companies that are financially strong and able to grow, even when economic growth is modest at best. Health care is her top sector because it has those defensive qualities, as well as pockets of innovation, such as in medical technology, that support high profit margins.
She said she is "not throwing in the towel on tech" in general, despite plunging share prices in big names like Apple and Facebook, and she said she particularly likes Asian tech companies. Ms. Moore also is "modestly encouraged" about emerging markets in Latin America and Asia, most notably Brazil and India.
Brian Singer, head of dynamic allocation strategies at William Blair & Company, has been investing "with a greater emphasis on risk management," he said. He finds American stocks "fundamentally less attractive" than others, such as emerging markets, including the two that Ms. Moore mentioned.
Among mature economies, Mr. Singer likes Britain, although he would rather wait until the question of its departure from the European Union, Brexit, is settled before stepping in, and Spain. Markets he is shunning, aside from the United States, are Japan, Canada, Mexico and South Africa. As for bonds, he is avoiding the high-yield market, and he talked up the virtues of another asset class that is often overlooked.
"In this environment, cash will be a relatively good alternative," he said. "It won't be a great return generator, but being cautious and holding cash is not a bad idea. It really is a time to remain defensive and have dry powder on hand."
With so much up in the air, Mr. Yardeni recommends not getting carried away. Investors should be selective about stocks and avoid index-tracking exchange-traded funds.
"This is probably a year for stock pickers," he said. "It's not a year for E.T.F.s."
He would emphasize domestic stocks and limit exposure to emerging markets, which may suffer from soft commodity prices, and to Europe, which is dealing with thorny issues like Brexit and Italy's recalcitrance in reining in government spending. The aging population bodes ill for long-term growth in Europe, too, Mr. Yardeni said, something that also applies in China.
He favors industries like technology, communications and media, which he expects to benefit over the long haul from the impending introduction of 5G, the fifth generation of mobile communications technology. Big banks and health care companies should do well, too, he said.
With investors focused on what's going wrong, Mr. Kane recommends that they also keep in mind what's going right, in particular the strong job market, although he noted that employment is often the last indicator to deteriorate as the economic cycle turns.
"If that part of the economy holds up, then this may not be a recession," he said. "You could get a very nice return for stocks if that turns out to be the environment." But he acknowledged that it's a big if.
A crucial question for him is whether the decline will be fairly mild by the time it's over, or something more severe, as in the 2008 financial crisis. For all the talk of recession, the losses so far have appeared calm and orderly, suggesting to him that too few investors have been asking the same question.
"Whether it's a garden-variety or end-of-days bear market," he said, "there's going to be panic, and we haven't gotten quite there yet."

Full text: After months of stock market declines, investment strategists are divided on appropriate responses.
There is a range of possible approaches, none as simple as the kind of straightforward investing that can lead to immediate rewards when the market is consistently rising.
Chris Brightman, chief investment officer at the investment advisory service Research Affiliates, for example, is currently unimpressed with most stocks.
"We do advise our investors to hold lower allocations to global equities -- particularly U.S. equities -- than normal," Mr. Brightman said. He urged broad diversification into such vehicles as Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, commodities and real estate investment trusts, as well as a tax-sheltered structure known as a master limited partnership. But he concedes that with "the exception of M.L.P.s," all are expensively priced.
Holding cash, in the form of a money-market fund, is another answer, but it is far from perfect, he said. "The problem with cash is you don't make any money," Mr. Brightman said. "It's the safest place to keep your money, but you get zero real return."
Nick Kalivas, senior equity product strategist at Invesco, said it was worth at least "thinking about" tweaking a portfolio to fortify it against risk.
He suggests funds that focus on stocks specifically selected because their fluctuations are low: They are known as low-volatility stocks, and they have outperformed the S&P 500 in 14 of the last 15 market downturns since 2011, according to Invesco.
Four times a year, Invesco compiles a list of the lowest-volatility stocks in the S&P 500. These are the companies whose shares are least affected by market turbulence. The current list features Coca-Cola as the least-volatile equity, followed by two utilities, the WEC Energy Group and Duke Energy, according to Mr. Kalivas.
Low-volatility stocks outperformed the market for most of 2018, according to Mo Haghbin, head of product research and development for Oppenheimer funds. Through December, portfolios of low-volatility stocks in the Oppenheimer Russell 1000 Dynamic Multifactor Exchange-Traded Fund lost 2.43 percent as opposed to the fund's benchmark, the Russell 1000, which lost 4.78 percent, Mr. Haghbin said. High-quality companies -- defined by superior grades on such metrics as return on assets, profits, margins and leverage -- also outperformed, losing 2.68 percent.
But investors who shift toward low-volatility portfolios should remember that such portfolios have historically lagged once the market turns up.
Two low-volatility E.T.F.s that outperformed the S&P 500 in 2018 were: Hartford Multifactor Low Volatility US Equity E.T.F., which was basically flat, and Invesco S&P 500 Low Volatility E.T.F., which lost just over 2 percent. The S&P 500 was down 6.2 percent last year.
Investors may also be wondering what to do about tech stocks, especially the Faangs (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google), which have been losing altitude rapidly after a seemingly endless ascent.
Through December, Facebook and Netflix were both down over 35 percent from their highs of last year. Apple and Amazon were each off more than 25 percent from their 2018 highs.
Although Kevin Landis is portfolio manager of the tech-focused Firsthand Technology Opportunities fund, he said he is wary of the big tech stocks. "When companies get bigger, they start looking more and more like government agencies," he said. "Even the biggest opportunities are at the saturation point. There's only so many iPhones you can sell."
With evidence of rising public concern about consumer privacy, Mr. Landis said, he expects to see greater regulation. "I spent the last 15 to 20 years being appalled at how readily people surrendered their own privacy," he said. "I welcome the idea that they've become more aware."
Mr. Landis said there were still good values in smaller tech companies. One major holding is Roku, which hopes to lure consumers who subscribe to cable. He contrasted its market cap of under $4 billion with Netflix's $111 billion market cap and said Roku was a better value.
But many advisers say investors should simply hold tight. Brian McMahon, manager of the Thornburg Investment Income Builder mutual fund, said that in many ways, the recent downturn "is pretty normal. This is not something to panic about." He said his largest investment, the CME Group, benefits from an active market. It makes good profits when people trade on options and futures contracts made on its platforms, he said. "CME Group benefits from volatility," he said.
In a similar vein, Kate Moore, chief equity strategist at BlackRock, said, "This is not a time to derisk and become completely defensive." There are still "pockets of quality" in the volatile markets, she added, citing the Chinese tech sector as one example.
But she said there were at least two major threats in the longer term. "We are increasingly concerned about long-term deficits and their impact on the bond market," she said. Bonds, already pressured in the near term by Federal Reserve rate increases, could also face long-term rate pressure from the ballooning Treasury financing required by mounting budget deficits.
Ms. Moore also said tech stocks could eventually lose value if new regulations were imposed to protect consumer privacy. "We don't expect any major regulatory changes in 2019," she said. "We certainly expect the government will impose regulations over the medium term."
Mr. Haghbin of Oppenheimer emphasized that portfolio decisions should reflect an investor's view of the larger economy. "If an investor feels that growth will continue to slow and risk appetite continue to decline, historically he would emphasize high-quality and low-volatility companies."
But, as Mr. Haghbin warned, investors may need to be nimble. "Things can change very quickly," he said.

G.M.'s Rosy Outlook
Lifts Its Stock Nearly 8%
General Motors executives on Friday bucked gloomy forecasts for growth and sent the automaker's shares soaring, promising investors stronger 2019 earnings and outlining ambitious plans for its Cadillac brand to challenge Tesla Inc. in the electric vehicle market.
G.M. said that despite forecasts of decline in the United States and China for passenger car sales, the company expects 2018 profit to exceed Wall Street expectations, and promised higher earnings per share in 2019. G.M.'s chief executive, Mary Barra, in her presentation to investors on Friday, stood her ground on cost-cutting actions that have provoked threats of retribution from President Trump and outrage from unions and elected officials.
"Because of the actions we have been taking for several years, General Motors enters 2019 leaner, more agile and positioned to win," Ms. Barra said.
The market cheered G.M.'s forecast, sending the company's stock up nearly 8 percent. REUTERS
ECONOMY
Cheaper Gas Sends Consumer Prices Down
Consumer prices slipped 0.1 percent last month, pulled down by sharply lower gas prices and cheaper air fares, used cars and mobile phone plans.
The consumer price index rose just 1.9 percent in December from a year earlier, the Labor Department said on Friday, the first time it has fallen below 2 percent since August 2017.
Excluding the volatile energy and food categories, core prices rose 0.2 percent for the third month in a row. They rose 2.2 percent from a year ago for the second straight month.
The figures suggest that the healthy economy is not yet creating widespread inflation pressures. That gives the Federal Reserve more leeway in deciding whether to raise short-term interest rates.
Fed policymakers lifted short-term rates four times last year and have forecast two more hikes this year. Yet some analysts think that slower United States and global growth, combined with low inflation, will keep the Fed from raising rates at all. AP
MEDIA
Fox Says It Won't Bid
For Disney Sports Stations
Twenty-First Century Fox said on Friday it does not plan to bid for any of the regional sports networks that Walt Disney Co. may need to sell to win the Justice Department's approval for its purchase of Fox's film and TV assets.
Fox's chairman, Lachlan Murdoch, said in November it was still an "open question" whether the company would buy back the regional sports networks it sold to Disney in July as part of the $71 billion deal.
Disney won a bidding war last year against the cable company Comcast Corp. to acquire Fox's assets. But the Justice Department has said Disney, which owns the cable sports network ESPN, must divest Fox's 22 networks that provide sports programming for regional and local markets.
After the Disney sale is completed, Fox will carve out a new company, including Fox News, Business, Sports and the Broadcasting Company, which it expects to have annual revenue of around $10 billion. REUTERS

Full text: CARACAS, Venezuela -- When President NicolÃ¡s Maduro of Venezuela was sworn in for his second term on Thursday before the country's Supreme Court, a small group of supporters standing outside greeted the news by waving tiny flags with little enthusiasm.
The huge crowds that gathered to greet him after his first inauguration were nowhere to be seen.
In the years since Mr. Maduro first took office, violence and hunger have become emblematic, inflation has skyrocketed, and the migration of Venezuelans out of the country has reached unprecedented levels.
Mr. Maduro and his predecessor, Hugo ChÃ¡vez, presided over the free fall of what was once Latin America's wealthiest nation. The country's economy continues to unravel at an alarming rate. And Mr. Maduro's re-election last year was widely denounced by other countries as fraudulent.
Venezuela's increasing isolation was evident inside the Supreme Court on Thursday. The presidents of Bolivia, Cuba, El Salvador and Nicaragua did attend the ceremony, along with representatives from China, Mexico and Turkey.
Notably absent, though, were representatives from the European Union and the United States, and members of the Lima Group -- 13 Latin American countries plus Canada that organized to find a solution to the crisis in Venezuela, and which last week announced that they would not recognize the legitimacy of Mr. Maduro's new term.
The Organization of American States said Thursday that it, too, would not recognize Mr. Maduro's new term as legitimate.
Despite these denunciations and the humanitarian crisis Venezuela is facing, Mr. Maduro is embarking on a term that extends until 2025.
So how did he get here, and how has he managed to hold on?
Here's what to know as Mr. Maduro begins his second term.
How was Maduro re-elected in such desperate conditions?
Mr. Maduro's re-election in May 2018 was widely criticized, with reports of coercion, fraud and electoral rigging.
He first came to power in a snap vote following Mr. ChÃ¡vez's death in 2013, after the former leader had anointed him as successor.
But by the 2018 election, Venezuela's economy had plummeted to new lows as a result of mismanagement and corruption, and the country was in the midst of a crisis.
Despite that, election officials said Mr. Maduro won 68 percent of the vote. The chaotic state of the country and the desperation of poor voters may actually have contributed to Mr. Maduro's ability to maintain control.
Representatives of Mr. Maduro's party tracked those who voted by registering their "Fatherland Card" -- or national benefits card -- and promised aid and government subsidized food handouts if he was re-elected.
Independent international observers were not on hand, and a crackdown on critics left several of them unable to participate. Opposition leaders called for a boycott of the election, and that, combined with the disillusionment of many longtime government supporters, meant the turnout was exceptionally low. Less than half of the country's voters cast ballots.
Mr. Maduro's stifling of dissent and targeting of the opposition has been widely reported. Since 2014, Human Rights Watch says, it has documented hundreds of cases of mistreatment of government opponents, including at least 31 cases of torture.
More than 12,800 people have been arrested because of links to antigovernment protests, according to the Venezuelan human rights organization Foro Penal, including demonstrators, bystanders and people taken from their homes without warrants.
The two groups on Thursday released a report detailing the detention and torture of intelligence and security forces accused of plotting against the government.
How strong is his grip on power?
Despite international criticism and a crisis at home, Mr. Maduro has won the loyalty of the country's powerful military by handing its leaders control of the food and oil industries as well as profitable mining regions.
Ricardo SÃ¡nchez, 35, is a member of the powerful Constituent Assembly, a new legislature created by Mr. Maduro and assigned to rewrite the country's Constitution. He said that support for the party was as strong as ever.
"We are convinced that the majority of the people who voted for the president in May are united today with loyalty and discipline to be with NicolÃ¡s Maduro for another six years," he said.
But there are clear signs of growing discontent.
Recent desertions include Christian Zerpa, a Supreme Court judge and longtime government loyalist. He fled to the United States, denouncing Mr. Maduro as incompetent and the elections as unfair.
In August, Mr. Maduro was purportedly targeted in a bizarre drone attack. And the Trump administration held secret meetings with rebellious military officers from Venezuela over the past year to discuss their plans to overthrow Mr. Maduro, according to American officials, before deciding against aiding the plotters.
International sanctions and plummeting oil production have further weakened the already floundering economy.
While the country's opposition lost much power because of government persecution and the forced exile of some of its most prominent figures, last week's election of Juan GuaidÃ³ as the new president of the opposition-controlled National Assembly has renewed calls to remove Mr. Maduro from power.
"We are going to effectively represent the people," Mr. GuaidÃ³ said, "and we have plans to call the people to the streets in legitimate protest."
Who still supports him?
Mr. Maduro has found some allies in the region, including President Evo Morales of Bolivia, a fellow socialist who attended the inauguration.
And Mexico's new leftist president, AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador, invited Mr. Maduro to his own inauguration and has taken a friendlier stance in relations with Venezuela than his predecessor.
Russia has remained a staunch ally, with President Vladimir V. Putin voicing his support for Mr. Maduro during a December meeting in Moscow. A year earlier, Russia agreed to restructure some $3 billion in loans to prevent Venezuela from defaulting.
Venezuela has also received recent financial support from China. After Mr. Maduro visited Beijing in September, he secured $5 billion in loans.
Within Venezuela, loyal "chavista" governors, named for their support of Mr. ChÃ¡vez and his revolutionary leftist policies, expressed support for Mr. Maduro in a news conference on Wednesday. HÃ©ctor RodrÃ­guez, governor of the state of Miranda, denounced Mr. Maduro's critics and urged the country's opposition to "reconsider" their criticism of him.
Still, there has been widespread international condemnation of Mr. Maduro's re-election and support from nations in the region is crumbling.
Last week, the Lima Group urged Mr. Maduro to hand over power to the National Assembly until another election could be held.
Argentina on Thursday said it had suspended entry of high-level Venezuelan government officials. Paraguay cut off diplomatic relations and closed its embassy in Venezuela, and said the electoral process was illegitimate.
What's the impact on the people?
Daily life in Venezuela has become unrecognizable from what it was just a few years ago. Where once the government built homes, clinics and schools for the poor as part of its socialist policy, people now find themselves without the most basic necessities.
The country's health system has collapsed, leaving many without access to lifesaving medicine. Hunger is common, and the shelves of grocery stores lie bare. And there is no sense conditions are improving. The International Monetary Fund anticipates that Venezuela's inflation rate will reach 10 million percent in 2019, becoming one of the worst cases of hyperinflation in modern history.
More than three million people have fled Venezuela since 2014, according to the United Nations migration agency, setting off a regional crisis that has left neighboring countries grappling with how to respond
Some Venezuelans who remain in the country have reached their breaking point.
Margarita Uzcategui, 64, who lives in what used to be a thriving neighborhood of Caracas, described water shortages and electricity cuts that can last for up to 12 hours.
"I never imagined I would have to live like this," she said.
While she said the government has failed her, she doesn't trust the opposition, either.
"For me, this is the end. This has to be the end," said Mrs. Uzcategui. "If we are living like this now, imagine six more years. We will have no food, water, electricity. God help us."

Full text: The momentum behind the American economy is strong. In 2018, unemployment hit its lowest rate in 49 years, 3.7 percent. Real wages were (finally) increasing and inflation remained muted. In 2019, growth is projected to slow but still remain above 2 percent.
Yet risks abound. The trade war and the escalating drama over the government shutdown threaten growth. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve's inaugural Financial Stability Report, an early warning system for the financial markets, recently highlighted the vulnerabilities created by investors who show a "high tolerance for risk-taking" in the market for corporate debt. The economy's continued health will hinge on whether big Wall Street banks can withstand shocks caused by these or other threats and continue lending.
On this front, it is far from certain that banks and their regulators are prepared.
Years of low interest rates have brought about excessive business debt and elevated prices for corporate bonds. The corporate bond market has swelled to nearly $7 trillion. The debt owed by businesses as a percentage of gross domestic product is at a record high. But the credit quality of investment-grade bonds has deteriorated. Underwriting standards on "leveraged loans" to risky companies have eroded. And until recently, yields on junk debt remained low, a sign that investors are too willing to take on the risk of bonds held by companies with less-than-stellar credit.
These vulnerabilities can amplify shocks and create systemic disruptions. In a market downturn, widespread downgrades of corporate bonds could induce a sell-off, precipitating sharp declines in the price of bonds and feeding a cycle of further downgrades, margin calls and sell-offs. Highly leveraged corporations may have difficulty refinancing or getting more credit, increasing the risk of corporate defaults and bankruptcies.
Cracks are already forming. In December, borrowing in the high-yield bond market came to a standstill. Deals in the leveraged loan market are also delayed from a lack of interest from mutual funds and collateralized loan obligation managers, the largest buyers of leveraged loans. These events signal trouble ahead for highly indebted companies seeking more financing.
This instability raises a basic question: Are the big banks strong enough to handle it? The Fed seems to think they are. The banks are better capitalized than before the 2008 financial crisis, and stress tests show they can withstand steep declines in prices of assets that they hold. But the Fed may be overly optimistic.
Wall Street banks have significant exposure to corporate debt. They underwrite and make markets in corporate bonds, make leveraged loans, invest in collateralized loan obligations, extend credit to businesses, including highly leveraged hedge funds, and buy and sell protection on corporate debt in the credit default swap market.
In a crisis, these exposures could serve as a channel for contagion in a highly interconnected financial system dominated by large banks.
Yet bank stress tests don't adequately capture this dynamic. Stress tests don't consider how a firm's response to a shock can reverberate. They also understate the effect of financial-sector distress on the economy. This helps explain why the tests have allowed bank capital to decline slightly despite elevated asset prices and increasingly stringent scenarios.
Stress tests also rely primarily on risk-based capital ratios, which vary based on the perceived riskiness of a bank's assets. These ratios are routinely gamed and, as we learned in 2008, are a poor indicator of a firm's financial health. A more credible yardstick is the supplementary leverage ratio, which is a simple cap on the percentage of a bank's funding from debt. But based on recent remarks by senior Fed officials, its role in stress testing may be eliminated altogether.
To be sure, reforms put in place after the 2008 financial crisis have enhanced bank resilience. The eight global systemically important banks in the United States now abide by additional capital and liquidity requirements, including a surcharge intended to ensure they absorb the effects of their own failure without disrupting the broader economy. But here, too, there are deficiencies. In calculating the surcharge, the Fed relies on incomplete historical data that ignore losses that taxpayer bailouts averted in the last crisis. These deficiencies don't inspire confidence.
Recessions that emerge from distress in the financial sector tend to run deeper and last longer than other recessions. As the former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker recently warned, the danger comes from "standing by while bubbles and excesses threaten financial markets."
So far, regulators appear to be doing exactly that -- or worse.
In recent months, regulators have proposed to reduce liquidity buffers of banks with as much as $700 billion in assets, dilute the strength and frequency of stress tests, water down the Volcker Rule prohibition on risky trading and cut leverage capital requirements for corporate derivatives exposures. Pressed by lobbyists and others, regulators are now contemplating a further weakening of the surcharge on the eight systemically important banks.
To prevent a repeat of 2008, regulators must look beyond the concerns of bank lobbyists. Instead of cutting capital to increase shareholder returns or making it easier to bail out giant financial institutions the next time around, regulators must address threats to the economy. This means requiring thicker capital cushions for the big banks and tighter leveraged loan underwriting standards. These steps would help secure a safer financial system and possibly avoid another crisis.

Hopes Rise With 4th Straight Up Day

Full text: Stocks clinched their fourth consecutive gain Wednesday as indexes around the world build on their early 2019 rally. The gains for indexes in the United States faded slightly after President Trump and Democratic leaders said Mr. Trump cut short a meeting on ending the partial shutdown of the federal government.
The last four-day winning streak for the S&P 500 ended in mid-September. The index, the benchmark for many mutual funds, retirement plans and investment professionals, has climbed 9.9 percent since Dec. 24.
Negotiators from the United States and China extended their trade talks to a third day, which investors took as a sign the trade discussions were productive even though the two sides did not announce any breakthroughs. Stocks linked to faster economic growth, such as technology and energy companies, kept rising.
Oil prices rose for the ninth day out of 10, bringing United States crude back above $50 a barrel for the first time in almost a month. European stocks made solid gains and Asian indexes jumped.
Wednesday's rally thinned when Trump tweeted that his meeting with Congressional leaders was a "waste of time," while top Democrats said Trump left after they didn't agree to fund the border wall Trump has demanded.
The partial government shutdown has lasted almost three weeks, meaning 800,000 federal employees are temporarily out of work or working unpaid. Because many federal agencies are shuttered, the government cannot send out a variety of payments, government-backed mortgage loan applications are not being approved, companies cannot go public on stock exchanges, and a number of economic reports watched by investors are not being released.
U.S. Bank Wealth Management chief equity strategist Terry Sandven said the economy looks solid, but this year is likely to be bumpy because investors will be very sensitive to trade threats and signs of slower growth.
"We're in this roller-coaster mode," he said. "We're in a trading range that we'll be in for the course of the year."
The S&P 500 climbed 10.55 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,584.96. The Dow Jones industrial average picked up 91.67 points, or 0.4 percent, to 23,879.12. The Nasdaq composite rose 60.08 points, or 0.9 percent, to 6,957.08.
Mr. Sandven said stocks could keep rising next week as American corporations start to report their fourth-quarter results, as their profits are expected to rise compared to last year.
"You still have moderating earnings growth, non-problematic inflation and relatively low interest rates," he said.
Experts think the trade negotiations may continue for months.
Chipmaker Micron Technology surged 5.6 percent to $35.93 and competitor Broadcom climbed 3.7 percent to $244.77. Many chip companies have manufacturing operations in China and make big chunks of their sales there. Traders felt that made them especially vulnerable in the trade spat. They were also concerned about an abrupt slowdown in the global economy and the possibility that supplies were too large.
Oil prices hit their highest in almost a month after rising for the ninth day in the last 10. United States crude rose 5.2 percent to $52.36 a barrel in New York. It has jumped 15 percent so far in 2019.
Lennar jumped 7.9 percent to $46.29 and other homebuilders also rose after its chief executive, Stuart Miller, said more potential buyers have been coming to Lennar's model homes recently as mortgage rates dipped. That could be a sign sales will pick up.
Homebuilder stocks took huge losses in 2018 as high prices and rising mortgage rates hurt sales.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was down 0.02 points at 2.71 percent.
Gold rose 0.5 percent to $1,289.30 an ounce.
The dollar slipped to 108.28 yen from 108.65 yen. The euro climbed to $1.1544 from $1.1443.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

In Wales, a Renewed Fervor for Nuclear

Full text: CEMAES, Wales -- Not far from this harbor village of brightly painted houses on Anglesey Island, a huge construction project is underway. Gates and wire fences are up. Archaeologists are sifting through dirt to document stony dwellings dating from 100 B.C. A technical school is welcoming apprentices eager to learn how to maneuver in high-tech control rooms and operate water-cooling systems.
The activity is all tied to a plan by Horizon Nuclear Power to turn this rugged outpost into the home of a plant that could be critical not just to the company, but to the Welsh economy and Britain's energy future.
Horizon, a subsidiary of the Japanese conglomerate Hitachi, is in private talks with the British government over how and when it might build a nuclear plant here at the northern tip of Wales. If the parties reach a deal on how the project's estimated 15 billion pound ($18.95 billion) cost will be paid, this stronghold of Welsh culture will change in ways that residents are just starting to consider.
Some people worry about nonstop truck traffic, the blasting of rock and soil, and the waves of outsiders the plant would bring to live and work in the area.
Others in northern Wales herald the economic benefit the potentially enormous investment could have. They see the Horizon plant, which is expected to produce enough electricity for 5.5 million homes, as a vehicle for rebirth.
The British government, eager for reliable, low-carbon energy to replace aging coal plants and nuclear reactors, has been encouraging. Greg Clark, the business and energy minister, told Parliament in June that the new Wales plant, Wylfa Newydd, was "next" in Britain's nuclear "pipeline" and that the government would consider making a "direct investment" in it with Japanese government agencies.
But Horizon and Hitachi executives are frustrated with the pace of the talks. In an interview, Duncan Hawthorne, Horizon's chief executive, said Hitachi had spent "billions" of pounds on the project, including the cost of acquiring it from two German utilities in 2012.
"It is a very long and expensive road here," he said, adding that "the next several months will be critical."
Hitachi, without providing exact figures, wants government financing from Britain and Japan to help attract outside investors like pension funds that seek long-term income streams. Investments by the governments would also help lower Horizon's risk rating.
The Wylfa Newydd plant, with two giant reactors, would be just the second nuclear plant to be built in the United Kingdom since the 1990s. Once a world leader, Britain's nuclear industry atrophied after serious accidents in Ukraine and the United States spurred broad resistance to nuclear power.
Britain has legally committed to cutting carbon emissions. As a result, the government is reassessing its energy options amid a decline in natural gas from the North Sea oil fields and a decision to phase out the use of coal.
Proponents of wind and solar energy say Britain should be putting its money there, but those sources have not been able to match the steady supply of power nuclear energy produces. So nuclear plants are back in vogue. One is being built at Hinkley Point in southwest England, and at least four more are planned.
"It's hard to conceive that nuclear does not have an important role to play," said Steve Holliday, a former chief executive of National Grid, the British power system operator.
Britain's renewed interest in nuclear power stands out among Western countries, where such plants have become forbiddingly costly and complex. The challenges were evident in October when Toshiba scrapped plans to build a plant in northern England.
Delays and cost overruns at plants being built at Olkiluoto, Finland, and Flamanville, France, have hurt the industry's reputation elsewhere in Europe. Germany, the region's top manufacturing power, is phasing out nuclear power. An abundance of cheap shale gas has undercut interest in the United States, although two new plants are in the works.
Hitachi is intent on the plant in Wales, Mr. Hawthorne said, because it would provide a key European foothold after the 2011 Fukushima accident dampened interest in Japan. Horizon executives have described the area as an ideal location, with water from the sea to be used in the cooling system and the rocky terrain able to bear the massive concrete structure that nuclear power demands.
For Anglesey Island, with a population of about 70,000, the project would provide a huge lift and create around 850 permanent jobs. Many local residents favor it because a smaller nuclear facility on a nearby seaside bluff was a dependable employer for nearly 50 years before closing in 2015.
Gareth Winston Roberts, a local councilor who worked at the plant -- known as Wylfa, after the bluff -- before retiring in the 1990s, called it "a godsend."
"It kept people here," he said. "It produced a lot of engineers."
Gwen Parry-Jones worked there beginning in 1989. Since April, she has been Horizon's executive director and is steering the negotiations with the government. For the previous decade, she was an executive at EDF Energy, a French-owned utility that has taken over much of Britain's nuclear system.
"I benefited from having a nuclear power station effectively on my doorstep as a young scientist," she said. "I strongly feel that we are benefiting from the fact that there is an existing nuclear power station here."
The need for jobs is obvious. The Wylfa plant still employs some technicians to remove fuel rods, but a local chemical plant closed in 2004 and an aluminum smelter closed in 2009. Britain's plan to leave the European Union this year could hurt another key employer, the port at Holyhead, a hub for trade with Ireland, an E.U. member.
"We find ourselves in a position where we need that one big project," said Edward T. Jones, a local cattle farmer who also lectures on economics at Bangor Business School in North Wales.
Some local leaders also see the plant as a vehicle for preserving the island's character.
"We still have got the Welsh language, and it's quite a strong part of our community," said Llinos Medi, the leader of the island's governing council. "With work we can keep our young people and our culture and our Welsh language."
But some residents believe the plant could damage the island's rural charm and hurt tourism. A walk along the pebble beach at Cemlyn Bay, a wildlife sanctuary next to the construction site, suggests why.
The old Wylfa plant sits at the beach's eastern end. Because the new one will be far larger, much of the surrounding landscape must be reshaped to accommodate it. The North Wales Wildlife Trust has been asking that fragile wildlife populations -- thousands of terns nest here every summer -- be taken into consideration.
"It is going to completely spoil the area," said Simon Walker, a retired businessman who was on the shore with his wife, Susan, watching his four dogs splash in the water.
Last month, in a nod to environmental concerns, the Welsh government said it would review the site preparations. Horizon said it disagreed with the move, which could result in delays.
Whether the plant proceeds will probably come down to how it will be paid for.
A key yardstick is the Hinkley Point facility in southwest England. The government is financing that plant's Â£20 billion cost through a so-called contract for difference, an arrangement that guarantees developers of big energy projects a long-term base rate for the power they produce. If the price of electricity falls below that rate, customers pay higher bills to make up the difference.
At Hinkley Point, the British government guaranteed the owners an inflation-indexed price of Â£92.50 per megawatt-hour for 35 years. That is about 50 percent higher than current energy rates. Not surprisingly, the government has been criticized for potentially saddling consumers with expensive electricity for decades.
With Horizon, the British government is pushing for a rate up to 30 percent lower than what it agreed to for Hinkley Point. Mr. Hawthorne of Horizon said he anticipated the Wales plant could provide power at "a significant price reduction" compared with Hinkley Point.
The question is whether a British government consumed with the process of leaving the European Union is prepared to move quickly on the Anglesey Island project -- and how pivotal it believes the plant is to its climate change promises.

2018 Was The Best Year In History!

Full text: The world is, as everyone knows, going to hell, but there's still the nervous thrill of waiting to see precisely which dark force will take us down. Will the economy collapse first, the ice sheets melt first, or chaos and war envelop us first?
So here's my antidote to that gloom: Let me try to make the case that 2018 was actually the best year in human history.
Each day on average, about another 295,000 people around the world gained access to electricity for the first time, according to Max Roser of Oxford University and his Our World in Data website. Every day, another 305,000 were able to access clean drinking water for the first time. And each day an additional 620,000 people were able to get online for the first time.
Never before has such a large portion of humanity been literate, enjoyed a middle-class cushion, lived such long lives, had access to family planning or been confident that their children would survive. Let's hit pause on our fears and frustrations and share a nanosecond of celebration at this backdrop of progress.
On a dirt road in rural Angola a few years ago, I met a woman named Delfina Fernandes who had lost 10 children, out of 15; she had endured perhaps the greatest blow any parent can, and she had suffered it 10 times.
Yet such child deaths are becoming far less common. Only about 4 percent of children worldwide now die by the age of 5. That's still horrifying, but it's down from 19 percent in 1960 and 7 percent in 2003.
Indeed, children today in Mexico or Brazil are less likely to die by the age of 5 than American children were as recently as 1970.
The big news that won't make a headline and won't appear on television is that 15,000 children died around the world in the last 24 hours. But in the 1990s, it was 30,000 kids dying each day.
Perhaps it seems Pollyannish or tasteless to trumpet progress at a time when there is so much butchery, misrule and threat hanging over us. But I cover the butchery and misrule every other day of the year, and I do this annual column about progress to try to place those tragedies in perspective.
One reason for this column is that journalism is supposed to inform people about the world, and it turns out that most Americans (and citizens of other countries, too) are spectacularly misinformed.
For example, nine out of 10 Americans say in polls that global poverty is worsening or staying the same, when in fact the most important trend in the world is arguably a huge reduction in poverty. Until about the 1950s, a majority of humans had always lived in "extreme poverty," defined as less than about $2 a person per day. When I was a university student in the early 1980s, 44 percent of the world's population lived in extreme poverty.
Now, fewer than 10 percent of the world's population lives in extreme poverty, as adjusted for inflation.
Likewise, Americans estimate that 35 percent of the world's children have been vaccinated. In fact, 86 percent of all 1-year-olds have been vaccinated against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis.
"Everyone seems to get the world devastatingly wrong," Dr. Hans Rosling, a brilliant scholar of international health, wrote in "Factfulness," published in 2018, after his death. "Every group of people I ask thinks the world is more frightening, more violent and more hopeless -- in short, more dramatic -- than it really is."
I suspect that this misperception reflects in part how we in journalism cover news. We cover wars, massacres and famines but are less focused on progress.
In the last year, I've covered atrocities against the Rohingya in Myanmar, starvation in Yemen, climate change in Bangladesh, refugees and child marriage at home, and some of the world's worst poverty, in Central African Republic. All those stories deserve more attention, not less. But I never wrote columns or newsletters about three nations that registered astounding progress against authoritarianism and poor governance in 2018, Armenia, Ethiopia and Malaysia.
It is of course true that there are huge challenges ahead. The gains against global poverty and disease seem to be slowing, and climate change is an enormous threat to poor nations in particular. And the United States is an outlier, where life expectancy is falling, not rising as in most of the world.
So there's plenty to fret about. But a failure to acknowledge global progress can leave people feeling hopeless and ready to give up. In fact, the gains should show us what is possible and spur greater efforts to improve opportunity worldwide.
Every other day of the year, go ahead and gnash your teeth about President Trump or Nancy Pelosi, but take a break today (remember, just for a nanosecond!) to recognize that arguably the most important thing in the world now is not Trumpian bombast. Rather, it may be the way the world's poorest and most desperate inhabitants are enjoying improved literacy and well-being, leading to a day when no mom will again lose 10 children.

Distillers Dream of a 'Napa-fication' of Kentucky

Full text: In September 2014, a bourbon brand called Kentucky Owl began to appear on liquor-store shelves around Louisville. The American whiskey market was booming, and dozens of new bourbons were showing up each year. But Kentucky Owl was different. Released exclusively within the state in tiny quantities and produced by the scion of an old Kentucky whiskey family, it had an undeniable mystique -- and a price tag of $170.
To skeptics, Kentucky Owl was proof that the whiskey trend had reached its Tulip Mania moment. At the time, few bourbons commanded even $50 at retail. Plus, the man behind the brand, Dixon Dedman, didn't even make the whiskey himself; he bought barrels from other distilleries, then blended them. Surely the bubble was about to pop.
It didn't. Within a few weeks, nearly every bottle of Kentucky Owl had sold out. On the secondary market, flippers were asking -- and getting -- five times what they had paid in stores. "Before you knew it, before anybody had reviewed it, you had people camping out to buy a bottle of Kentucky Owl," said Fred Minnick, the editor of Bourbon+ magazine and the author of "Bourbon: The Rise, Fall and Rebirth of an American Whiskey."
Several factors gave Kentucky Owl a boost. It had heritage: Mr. Dedman, whose family runs a century-old inn popular with bourbon fans, named it after a long-defunct brand created by his great-great-grandfather. Early hype by retailers, along with rumors about the source of the whiskey, also built early interest.
Above all, Kentucky Owl debuted at a moment when whiskey fans, flush with money from a surging heartland economy, were willing to pay extra to get the next hot thing in bourbon. Soon, Kentucky Owl had achieved cult status -- and signaled a fundamental change in the American whiskey market.
"People have called us the Screaming Eagle of bourbon," Mr. Dedman said in August, referring to the $3,000-per-bottle cabernet sauvignon whose debut, in 1995, represented a shift toward stratospheric luxury in the Napa Valley wine industry.
Not that he's complaining. In January 2017, less than three years after introducing Kentucky Owl, Mr. Dedman and his business partner sold the brand to SPI Group, the Luxembourg-based company best known for making Stolichnaya vodka, for an undisclosed sum rumored to be in the high seven figures. Six months later, the new owners revealed plans for a $150 million "Kentucky Owl Park" in Bardstown, an hour southeast of Louisville, featuring not just a distillery but a convention center, two lakes and, eventually, a luxury hotel. The company broke ground in November 2017, at an event attended by Governor Matt Bevin, and it plans to open the first phase of the site in 2020.
The brand's rapid ascent took Mr. Dedman by surprise. "I never had a vision for how fast this thing would grow," he said.
You could say the same thing about the Kentucky whiskey industry itself. Although the bourbon market has been growing for almost two decades, a transformation has taken place in the last five years, a reshaping of the industry's potential that most people didn't see coming and are only now starting to grapple with.
Between 2012 and 2017, sales of bourbon whiskey -- 95 percent of which is made in Kentucky -- soared by more than 50 percent, to $3.3 billion. To keep up with demand, nearly two dozen new distilleries have opened in Kentucky in the last five years, including three around Bardstown, a town of 13,000 that sits in the center of bourbon country. Established companies like Beam Suntory and Brown-Forman are undertaking hundred-million-dollar capital projects, while scores of new rickhouses -- the enormous warehouses used to age whiskey -- dot the rolling hills around Louisville.
But the changes are about more than money and investment. Americans aren't just buying more whiskey, and paying more for each bottle. They're buying into an entire "bourbon experience," from whiskey-themed boutique hotels in downtown Louisville to trendy restaurants with "curated" whiskey lists to fleets of tour buses carting bachelorette parties and corporate retreats from distillery to distillery.
"It's unbelievable," said Trey Zoeller, the founder of Jefferson's, a bourbon brand based in Louisville that just built a sprawling visitors center and has plans to quintuple the size of its distillery. "Truly, you build it and they will come."
The most ambitious people in the industry talk about the "Napa-fication" of bourbon, doing for American whiskey what Napa Valley did for American wine: not just make it in huge volumes, but elevate it to a world-class luxury status, built around a region and an image designed to generate billions of dollars in tourism, retail sales and investment. The sort of place where a $170 bottle of Kentucky Owl is actually a pretty good deal, and a far cry from the rural simplicity that bourbon was built on.
"This region has matured with the rise of the bourbon industry the way a stupid underage kid grows up to be a sophisticated adult," Mr. Dedman said. "I would never in my wildest dreams have imagined that we'd be where we are today."
'The wise man's bourbon'
Dixon Dedman is Kentucky royalty. His great-great-grandfather Charles Dedman founded one of the state's largest distilleries in the late 19th century, and his family has owned the award-winning, 31-room Beaumont Inn in Harrodsburg, Ky., for over a century. Tall, sandy-haired and soft-spoken at 37, Mr. Dedman exudes the image of a down-home goober -- his word -- that barely papers over a sharp, analytical mind.
"He plays dumb really well," said Mr. Minnick, "but he's really smart." (Disclosure: I've written for Mr. Minnick's magazine.)
There was never a question that Mr. Dedman would go into the family business. During college, in the early 2000s, he worked at the Beaumont Inn during the summer, and less than a week after graduation he was back washing dishes. Revenues were down, though, and major improvements were being pushed back for lack of money. The inn shut down for four months every winter for lack of visitors. With Mr. Dedman's father easing into retirement, it was suddenly up to him to save the family legacy.
Part of the problem was location. Even though it is in the middle of bourbon country, just east of Bardstown, Harrodsburg sits in a dry county -- which meant the inn couldn't cater to thirsty tourists visiting nearby distilleries.
"We'd get people coming through after seeing a distillery, and the strongest thing I could serve them in the restaurant was black coffee," Mr. Dedman said.
That changed in 2003, when the county voted to allow restaurants in Harrodsburg to sell liquor by the glass. Mr. Dedman pounced: He started selling drinks in the Beaumont's main dining room, and he opened two adjacent taverns, both of which became overnight successes in a town that was dying for a drink. (In 2015, the James Beard Foundation gave the inn an America's Classics award, which it bestows on distinguished regional restaurants.)
The decision to relax Harrodsburg's dry laws, and Mr. Dedman's push to sell liquor, came just as the bourbon industry was beginning to recover from a decades-long slump in consumer demand. In 1969 distillers produced 1.9 million barrels of whiskey, according to the Kentucky Distillers Association; in 1999, the industry's low point, it made just 455,000.
But in the mid-2000s, a younger generation of drinkers shifted back toward bourbon, drawn as much by its flavors as by its story as an authentic American craft. Like locally sourced food and artisanal furniture, bourbon appealed to consumers tired of flashy luxury and looking for simple, recognizable products. Between 2000 and 2010, revenues for American whiskey distilleries grew by 46 percent, according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, and tourists began pouring into Kentucky to see where all that whiskey was made.
That was especially good news for a place like the Beaumont Inn. Not only were locals flocking to its bars, but a mounting number of whiskey tourists, arriving to visit nearby distilleries like Four Roses and Maker's Mark, were lining up to stay in its guest rooms. By 2005, it was operating year-round.
Mr. Dedman had more on his mind than rescuing the Beaumont Inn. His great-great-grandfather's distillery, which opened on the banks of the Kentucky River in 1879, had grown rapidly, thanks to the success of its flagship whiskey, Kentucky Owl. Charles Dedman gave it the slogan "the wise man's bourbon."
The C.M. Dedman Distillery was forced to close during Prohibition, though, and it never reopened. Mr. Dedman's father and grandfather had often talked about restarting the brand, but it was idle chatter. In 2008, with the inn back to financial stability despite the looming recession, Mr. Dedman set out to realize their dream.
Instead of opening his own distillery -- a costly and time-intensive project -- Mr. Dedman decided to "source" whiskey distilled elsewhere, then bottle it under his own label. But sourcing decent whiskey presents its own challenges: Acquiring stocks of bourbon is largely a matter of knowing the right people to open the right doors. Fortunately, Mr. Dedman knew people: Generations of traveling whiskey businessmen had stayed at his family's hotel.
Among them was Jim Rutledge, the master distiller at Four Roses. Mr. Rutledge, who recently retired after 49 years with the distillery, is widely regarded as one of the greatest whiskey makers of his generation. Starting in 2010, Mr. Dedman would buy barrels of whiskey, then bring samples to Mr. Rutledge's home for him to assess.
Beating a $30,000 bottle of Scotch
Unfailingly polite but highly opinionated, Mr. Rutledge was not impressed. It turned out that even with access to good barrels, Mr. Dedman had something to learn about picking the right ones. "One day he had five samples, and we met over breakfast," Mr. Rutledge recalled. "I tried them and thought, 'How do I tell him not to ever put these in a bottle?' I told him he might have to blend them" -- a laborious process that involves taste-testing endless combinations of barrels.
Undeterred, that's what Mr. Dedman did. After closing up the inn at night, he would set up dozens of barrel samples at a table in the back of the restaurant and methodically mix them, paying close attention to their age, alcohol level, even where they had been sitting in the warehouse (temperature affects how a whiskey ages, and temperatures vary widely in an unheated warehouse).
It took nearly four years, but he finally settled on a blend he liked. He combined the barrels, paid someone to bottle and label them, and then took them around to local liquor distributors.
Mr. Dedman insists that making a commercially successful whiskey was never his plan. "It's not like I thought it out, like I said here's what I'll do year one, and then what I'll do year five," he said. "I never thought, we should do this because bourbon is on the move." Looking back, he cringes at how amateur the whole operation was -- he didn't have a sales plan, or a marketing strategy.
None of that mattered. By almost all accounts, that first batch of Kentucky Owl was a transcendently beautiful bourbon, reminiscent of whiskey made in the mid-20th century, often considered a golden age of distilling. "When you pick up that bottle, Kentucky Owl just feels like Kentucky," Mr. Minnick said. "And when you taste the early releases of Owl, it just tastes like old Kentucky bourbon from the 1950s."
Kentucky Owl got an added boost from social media. Rumors, spread through bourbon chat rooms on Reddit and other sites, claimed that Mr. Dedman had worked closely with Julian Van Winkle III, the owner of the legendary Old Rip Van Winkle whiskey company. The information was false, but it supercharged the hype.
"People just went nuts," Mr. Minnick said. "Kentucky Owl just has that cool factor you cannot teach."
Other whiskey brands have begun asking three-figure prices too: A rye whiskey from Kentucky Peerless, a new distillery in Louisville, goes for an average of $120. Chicken Cock, another sourced and "revived" 19th-century brand, sells for $250. Even once-proletarian brands like Wild Turkey and Four Roses now offer limited-edition expressions at $200 or more.
But none has quite matched Kentucky Owl for sheer consumer excitement. That first batch totaled just 1,400 bottles, and never made it out of the state. Subsequent batches were similarly limited, even as demand for the whiskey exploded. Accolades piled up: In late 2014, Garden & Gun magazine named it the best drink in its Made in the South awards, while this summer Whisky Advocate gave Mr. Dedman's first batch of rye whiskey 95 points, beating out a $30,000 bottle of Bowmore single-malt Scotch.
Whiskey fans and writers talk about Kentucky Owl as the next Pappy Van Winkle, Mr. Van Winkle's flagship brand, bottles of which often fetch $5,000 or more. Others, betting on Mr. Dedman's blending skills and the global growth of American whiskey, see it going even higher, to sit in the same category as the Macallan single malt or ChÃ¢teau Latour Bordeaux.
"It has the potential to get up and stay among the world-class, luxury brands -- it has that kind of cachet," said Jeff Hopmayer, a strategic adviser in Nashville who has worked closely with several bourbon producers, including Kentucky Owl. "When I bring a bottle to a party, everyone freaks out."
Building a Napa Valley of whiskey
In early 2017, Mr. Dedman got a call from the office of Yuri Shefler, a Russian businessman. Mr. Shefler, who lives in London, is the sole owner of SPI Group, a global drinks company best known for Stolichnaya vodka, which Mr. Shefler acquired in 1999, two years after the Russian government sold it off.
Moscow, perhaps sensing that it had made a mistake in letting go of such a valuable brand, has sued to win Stolichnaya back. So far SPI Group has defended its most valuable property, but in recent years it has also diversified, buying or starting wineries in Spain and Argentina, a tequila distillery in Mexico and a rum distillery in Louisiana. Now, Mr. Shefler wanted a piece of the bourbon boom.
He wasn't alone. As American whiskey has demonstrated its staying power, it has attracted investors from around the world. In early 2017 RÃ©my Cointreau, the French drinks company, bought Westland, a craft distillery in Seattle; a few months later LVMH MoÃ«t Hennessy Louis Vuitton bought the Woodinville Whiskey Company, in Woodinville, Wash. And in September 2018 Edrington, the owner of the Macallan single malt, bought a minority stake in Wyoming Whiskey, based near Jackson Hole.
But Mr. Shefler and SPI Group wanted more than just an investment in a bourbon company -- they wanted to control a chunk of the bourbon experience. Kentucky Owl offered a unique opportunity: a prestigious brand with almost no footprint, a blank slate on which SPI Group could write its own bourbon story.
Mr. Dedman and his partner, Mark Carter, closed the deal in early 2017, for an undisclosed sum. (Mr. Carter and his wife, Sherri, who own an inn and a winery in California, left the company; last year they introduced their own whiskey brand, Old Carter, at $250 a bottle.)
As part of the deal, Mr. Dedman is staying on as a corporate ambassador and blender for Kentucky Owl, which will remain the company's premier brand. Mr. Dedman's operation will sit within a much larger project, also called Kentucky Owl, which will generate a range of whiskeys at different prices, all produced at a sprawling facility in Bardstown.
That facility, Kentucky Owl Park, represents the full expression of where American whiskey is headed. Built on a 450-acre limestone quarry, the park will be about much more than making whiskey: A visitor might get a distillery tour in the morning, eat a lakeside lunch, see a live-music show in the afternoon and sleep in a boutique hotel room that night, all without leaving the property.
"It's about creating that overall experience," said Rudy Costello, the chief executive of Stoli Group USA, which oversees Mr. Shefler's American holdings. "We see the tourism in that area already, and I don't think we've even scratched the surface."
Right now, the site of the future Kentucky Owl Park is, literally, a hole in the ground; it takes some imagination to picture it as a nirvana of whiskey. But the plan also fits neatly within the overall trajectory of the Kentucky bourbon industry -- a half-dozen distilleries lie within a few minutes' drive, and all of them are building amenities like restaurants, visitors centers, parks and hotels to cater to a new class of whiskey tourist.
The typical distillery was once a utilitarian industrial plant; now it's a boozy theme park. The recently opened Castle and Key Distillery outside Frankfort, Ky., which took over a defunct distillery site modeled after a medieval castle, sports a botanical trail and a manicured garden. The centerpiece of the new Bardstown Bourbon Company distillery is Bottle & Bond, a minimalist-chic restaurant run by the former chef at the Greenbrier Resort in West Virginia. Upping the ante, SPI Group hired Shigeru Ban, a Pritzker Prize-winning architect, to design the main buildings at Kentucky Owl Park.
For local business leaders, such changes promise to turn the region into something like a Napa Valley of whiskey, a place that combines high-end retailing, resort hotels, fine dining and, flowing through it all, an unending river of tourist dollars.
"We don't want it to be just an industry; we want it to be a destination," said Kim Huston, the president of the Bardstown Industrial Development Corporation. Ms. Huston takes the Napa comparison seriously: She travels frequently to Northern California to study how its most famous wine region went from a sleepy agricultural community in the 1980s to being a synonym for high-end living.
"We're probably where they were 20 years ago," she said. "Our goal is for Bardstown to play on the world stage of luxury tourism."
Not everyone in the region is on board with these plans. Kentucky is significantly more traditional and rural than a place like Napa, and even deep-pocketed companies like Beam Suntory can't easily push around social conservatives who bristle at the thought of turning their towns over to tourists, no matter how much money the visitors bring in.
But the skeptics might not be able to hold out for long. Bourbon fans are already streaming into the state -- 1.2 million people visited its distilleries in 2017, a 20 percent jump from 2016 and almost double the number in 2014, according to the Kentucky Distillers Association.
And after years of speculation about a bourbon bubble, distilleries and investors are confident that the expansion is here to stay.
"If you look at the total amount of bourbon sales today, it's still less than it was in the 1970s, adjusted for inflation," said Mr. Costello, the Stoli Group USA chief executive. "And there is still tremendous opportunity outside the United States, with some big emerging markets starting to tune into American whiskey."
For Kentucky, the bourbon industry's rapid change in fortune -- and its transformative effects on the state economy -- is something many still find overwhelming, Mr. Dedman included.
For all his business savvy and financial success, he's still a guy who grew up thinking he'd spend his life running a small hotel in rural Kentucky. "I know what we're doing is going to have a big footprint and make us a major player," he said, sighing. "But it's something I can't get my head around."

Full text: Perhaps at no other time of the year is it clearer that elective self-denial is just another privilege of affluence. If you indulged in December without abatement, then you are likely to approach January with the intent to say no -- to cheese, to craft beer, to Shake Shack, to cake doughnuts, to the braised short ribs you have perfected in an Instant Pot. You will stay home and make salads and eat undressed grains, and presumably the money you save will be spent on virtuous things.
During these exercises in asceticism you may often feel hungry, but in most cases you will not think about hunger in any broader or meaningful sense. This is not (necessarily) because you are cold and indifferent to the misfortunes of others.
Hunger as a defining symptom of poverty in the United States is rarely discussed, either at the level of engaged civilian conversation or as a political talking point. To do so would be to admit to a failure of democracy for which too many are to blame.
According to government statistics, one in eight households in the United States is food insecure, meaning those households are unable to afford a consistent supply of nourishment throughout the year. In New York City, the number of people living with food insecurity has decreased during the past six years, but the figure is still higher -- by 22 percent -- than it was before the recession. In the Bronx, more than one-third of all children go hungry regularly.
On Jan. 1, the new minimum wage, set at $15 an hour, went into effect in New York City, and most companies employing more than 10 people have to pay it. The increase, considered a crucial step in the fight against poverty, is the result of a hard-fought grass-roots organizing effort begun seven years ago and championed as a great victory by liberal politicians, even those who were initially not liberal enough to embrace it. But how much will the new standard do to alleviate some of the most punishing aspects of the city's affordability crisis?
Last year, San Francisco and Seattle enacted a $15 minimum wage. Though both cities are also fantastically expensive, it is too soon to to draw any comparison to New York, which presents its own challenges. (What we do know from a study examining the experiment in Seattle is that as wages increased on the path to $15 an hour, experienced workers benefited most from higher pay at the expense of reduced opportunities for workers with less experience.)
Buried under the relentless flood of news during the last months of 2018 was a report, sponsored in part by City Harvest, New York's largest supplier of food to pantries and hunger charities that suggested less-than-optimistic predictions for what a new wage standard might achieve. The authors of the report calculated a self-sufficiency standard, meant to determine how much income is now required to meet basic needs -- housing, child care, food, transportation, health care -- without help from public subsidies, for families of different sizes living in different parts of the city.
The study found that more than two in five households in New York City lacked the income to cover necessities. And yet just a third of those households were considered poor by measures used by the federal government -- measures typically used as qualifiers for certain kinds of public assistance and ones that do not account for family composition among many other variables.
You begin to understand some of the animosity directed at Amazon around its impending move to Queens, for example, when you see how much money is actually required to live there already, before housing prices are destined to be driven up even further by the company's expansion. A single parent with two school-age children, for example would need to make nearly $69,427 a year, according to City Harvest's Self-Sufficiency calculator. That amounts to an hourly wage of just under $33.
So to live comfortably enough in all but the most expensive quarters in Brooklyn, a two-parent family with two children would need to make about $70,000 a year, which would mean that each parent would need to earn just over $16 an hour. That figure accounts for the $433 the family would receive in child-related tax credits. All across the city, the cost of basic needs is rising faster for low-income families that conventional inflation metrics actually indicate. Also dispiriting is the fact that nearly a quarter of households that fall below the self-sufficiency standard include an adult with a bachelor's degree.
What this tells us is that the arrival of a $15 hourly minimum wage cannot be considered the end of something. New York may be a city of self-invention, but it is not a city of self-sustenance. We are reminded of this every time we encounter the financial diary of a millennial -- a new publishing subcategory -- that breaks down expenses for rent and restaurants and Uber and so on and all too often reveals that a pair of parents in Greenwich, or Marin, or somewhere, is supplementing the meager salary of a fashion or media hopeful.
In many, many cases, a $15 hourly wage will not bring a family, or even a single person, to an adequate living standard. That hardly means the fight was worthless; it just means the war is ongoing.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text: A year ago, in the wake of President Trump's tax cut, euphoric investors pushed the Dow Jones industrial average past 25,000, a record. The Dow had just gained 25 percent in 2017, and the Nasdaq had leapt 28 percent. Volatility was so low that there wasn't a single day in 2017 when the S&P 500 fluctuated more than 2 percent.
Not everyone was celebrating.
"If there are any certainties, one will be that this party will eventually come to an end," James Stack, president of InvesTech Research, told me a year ago. "And when it ends, it will end badly, and with high volatility."
Mr. Stack turned out to be right. He lowered his recommended asset allocation for United States stocks from 82 percent last January to 72 percent in September, when stocks hit new all-time highs. He urged investors to raise cash in October, and at the end of November he recommended an even more defensive posture -- including putting money in a fund whose value would rise when stock prices dropped. That brought his recommended net exposure to stocks to just 55 percent, the lowest since the depths of the last bear market in early 2009.
Stocks plunged in December, posting their worst monthly loss since the financial crisis and the worst December since 1931 and the Great Depression.
Yet most economic indicators are benign. Unemployment is an exceptionally low 3.7 percent. Wages are rising. Inflation remains below the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target. The Fed raised rates a quarter point in December, citing "a very healthy economy."
Given Mr. Stack's track record last year, I reached out to him this week for his current views. Even though valuations have come down and macroeconomic indicators "have remained remarkably strong," he said, he's still defensive and hasn't changed his bearish allocation. He believes that the worst isn't over and that the Dow and S&P 500 will soon be down 20 percent from their peaks, retreating into a bear market. (The Nasdaq Composite and the Wilshire 2000 index of small-cap stocks are already there.)
And that was before a revenue warning from Apple sent markets into another steep fall on Thursday.
"A lesson from history is that the market leads the economy by a lot longer than investors realize," Mr. Stack said. If the economy is headed toward recession, as the latest stock market declines suggest it may be, "we won't see the first economic warning signs until the first three to five months" of 2019. Among the leading indicators he's watching for signs of weakness are consumer confidence, housing starts and unemployment claims.
On Thursday, the Institute for Supply Management manufacturing index, a leading indicator of industrial activity, fell sharply. That suggests that "serious cracks" are starting to appear in the economy, Mr. Stack said.
Mr. Stack is right that bear markets typically precede recessions by many months: CNBC calculated in 2016 that bear markets since World War II had begun on average about eight months before a recession. That means that if a bear market did begin after major indexes peaked last fall, a recession might not start until June or even later. Even then, recessions are often over before economic data confirms their existence.
That's when bear markets are, in fact, followed by recessions, which often isn't the case. As the economist Paul Samuelson famously said, "The stock market has forecast nine of the last five recessions."
Since World War II, there have been 13 bear markets. They were followed within a year by a recession just seven times. As a predictor of recessions with just 54 percent accuracy, bear markets are little better than flipping a coin.
Indeed, Mr. Stack's data show that two or more down years in a row are quite rare: There have been only four instances since 1928, suggesting that stocks may well be in positive territory by the end of 2019, even if a bear market does materialize in the meantime.
Which is one reason the Wharton economist Jeremy Siegel told me that he's bullish on the stock market this year. He predicts it could rise between 5 percent and 15 percent, even if there is an economic slowdown.
Stocks are much cheaper now than they were before the December sell-off. The ratio between stock prices and projected earnings for companies in the S&P 500 is about 17, down from over 19 a year ago and the lowest in the past five years.
[Stocks rose Friday after the release of a strong December jobs report and comments by the chairman of the Federal Reserve that the central bank would be flexible on raising interest rates this year.]
Mr. Stack, however, argued that in the event of an economic downturn -- or even a significant slowdown -- "those projected earnings will go out the window."
"I would not call today's market undervalued," he added.
Mr. Siegel bases his forecast of a market rally on the belief that the Fed will stop raising short-term interest rates. "I think the Fed got the message from the markets that it should not have hiked in December," he said.
Mr. Stack, too, said he was surprised the Fed raised rates in December. "I think the Fed will stand down and put future rate increases on hold," he said, "which could stabilize the market, at least for the time being."
But Mr. Stack's technical indicators are still pointing toward a bear market. He's also worried about the shaky housing market, with price drops and slowing sales showing up in major cities.
"We're not trying to time the market, but we're very comfortable with our defensive allocation," he said. Although he predicted higher volatility a year ago, he was nonetheless surprised by the extremes reached in December, without even "a single hard warning sign of recession on the horizon."
"Can you imagine," he asked, "how volatile it will be when we do have those warnings?"

Full text: ATLANTA -- It was only 16 days ago when the Federal Reserve raised interest rates and its chairman, Jerome Powell, conveyed that he was fundamentally confident about the outlook for the United States economy.
To markets, he came across as excessively dismissive of the message that turbulent stock, bond and commodity prices were sending. His comments were interpreted as implying the Fed was dead-set on pushing interest rates higher to prevent some hypothetical future inflation, consequences be damned.
It's clear that a jaw-dropping series of market swings, combined with some hints that a broader economic slowdown could be on the way, have made Mr. Powell rethink things.
Two weeks ago, the consensus of Mr. Powell's Fed colleagues was that two more interest rate increases were likely this year. In his message Friday, in a panel I moderated at the American Economic Association, he decidedly did not reaffirm that projection. Instead, his emphasis was on flexibility, adaptability and open-mindedness.
The markets seemed to love it -- and why wouldn't they? Mr. Powell's appearance essentially repaired the damage from his indifferent tone of two weeks ago.
The market response Friday -- the S&P 500 rose quickly and closed up 3.4 percent -- seemed to be to his opening comments, which Mr. Powell read from notes. They were deliberate and precise words, not off-the-cuff remarks. Sometimes, markets overreact to extemporaneous remarks a Fed chief makes in a news conference or in a congressional hearing; this was not one of those cases.
It also helped that the dovish message arrived less than two hours after an employment report that showed exceptionally strong job growth in December.
For certain monetary policy traditionalists, the robust wage growth in that report -- up 3.2 percent over the past year -- could point to inflation worries. But in the panel, Mr. Powell made a point of saying the wage growth number did not alarm him and should not be taken as a signal that prices were set to spiral out of control.
It is a safe bet that the Fed will not be raising rates in the early months of 2019, and will resume its tightening campaign only once the global outlook is clearer, or once a more substantial inflation risk appears in the United States.
It's particularly clear that the lessons of history loom large in Mr. Powell's thinking. In 2015 and early 2016, when he was a Fed governor and Janet Yellen was chairwoman, an eerily similar episode dragged down U.S. economic growth so much that it can be thought of as a mini-recession.
In that episode, the Fed's push to raise interest rates helped fuel a vicious cycle of slower growth overseas, falling commodity prices, a stronger dollar and lower inflation.
There are differences this time around -- in particular, a trade war with China is a big factor in the slowdown in Chinese growth. Another difference is that the United States economy is stronger now, with an unemployment rate below 4 percent for six straight months, making the overheating risk in the United States higher.
But the similarity comes in the ways that actions taken by Fed officials in Washington can ripple around the globe and come back to bite the United States economy in unpredictable ways.
The fact that Mr. Powell brought up the episode from 2015 and early 2016 -- in the prepared portion of his comments, and in response to an open-ended question about the economy -- is a sign that he thinks it is relevant to current policy.
Will 2019 be as hard a year for the economy as financial markets seem to be bracing for? The economic data is still quite strong, none more so than the latest job numbers. But, as Mr. Powell said, those are backward-looking indicators, and the Fed must make policy by looking forward.
The loud-and-clear message is that Mr. Powell and his colleagues aren't going to put their hands over their ears, ignore these messages from markets, and carry on as planned.
And that, in turn, seems to make some of the darker possibilities for 2019 a lot less likely.

Given Mr. Stack's track record last year, I reached out to him this week for his current views. Even though valuations have come down and macroeconomic indicators "have remained remarkably strong," he said, he's still defensive and hasn't changed his bearish allocation. He believes that the worst isn't over and that the Dow and S&P 500 will soon be down 20 percent from their peaks, retreating into a bear market. (The Nasdaq Composite and the Wilshire 2000 index of small-cap stocks are already there.)
And that was before a revenue warning from Apple sent markets into another steep fall on Thursday.
"A lesson from history is that the market leads the economy by a lot longer than investors realize," Mr. Stack said. If the economy is headed toward recession, as the latest stock market declines suggest it may be, "we won't see the first economic warning signs until the first three to five months" of 2019. Among the leading indicators he's watching for signs of weakness are consumer confidence, housing starts and unemployment claims.
On Thursday, the Institute for Supply Management manufacturing index, a leading indicator of industrial activity, fell sharply. That suggests that "serious cracks" are starting to appear in the economy, Mr. Stack said.
Mr. Stack is right that bear markets typically precede recessions by many months: CNBC calculated in 2016 that bear markets since World War II had begun on average about eight months before a recession. That means that if a bear market did begin after major indexes peaked last fall, a recession might not start until June or even later. Even then, recessions are often over before economic data confirms their existence.
That's when bear markets are, in fact, followed by recessions, which often isn't the case. As the economist Paul Samuelson famously said, "The stock market has forecast nine of the last five recessions."
Since World War II, there have been 13 bear markets. They were followed within a year by a recession just seven times. As a predictor of recessions with just 54 percent accuracy, bear markets are little better than flipping a coin.
Indeed, Mr. Stack's data show that two down years in a row are quite rare: There have been only four instances since 1928, suggesting that stocks may well be in positive territory by the end of 2019, even if a bear market does materialize in the meantime.
Which is one reason the Wharton economist Jeremy Siegel told me that he's bullish on the stock market this year. He predicts it could rise between 5 percent and 15 percent, even if there is an economic slowdown.
Stocks are much cheaper now than they were before the December sell-off. The ratio between stock prices and projected earnings for companies in the S&P 500 is about 17, down from over 19 a year ago and the lowest in the past five years.
[Stocks rose Friday after the release of a strong December jobs report and comments by the chairman of the Federal Reserve that the central bank would be flexible on raising interest rates this year.]
Mr. Stack, however, argued that in the event of an economic downturn -- or even a significant slowdown -- "those projected earnings will go out the window."
"I would not call today's market undervalued," he added.
Mr. Siegel bases his forecast of a market rally on the belief that the Fed will stop raising short-term interest rates. "I think the Fed got the message from the markets that it should not have hiked in December," he said.
Mr. Stack, too, said he was surprised the Fed raised rates in December. "I think the Fed will stand down and put future rate increases on hold," he said, "which could stabilize the market, at least for the time being."
But Mr. Stack's technical indicators are still pointing toward a bear market. He's also worried about the shaky housing market, with price drops and slowing sales showing up in major cities.
"We're not trying to time the market, but we're very comfortable with our defensive allocation," he said. Although he predicted higher volatility a year ago, he was nonetheless surprised by the extremes reached in December, without even "a single hard warning sign of recession on the horizon."
"Can you imagine," he asked, "how volatile it will be when we do have those warnings?"

Full text: Thirteen nations announced on Friday that they would not recognize the legitimacy of the new presidential term of NicolÃ¡s Maduro of Venezuela, who is set to be inaugurated next week for a second time.
Diplomats from Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras, Panama, Paraguay, Peru and St. Lucia issued a joint statement after meeting in the Peruvian capital, denouncing last year's election as flawed and urging Mr. Maduro to hand power to the opposition-controlled National Assembly until another election could be held.
"The electoral process carried out in Venezuela on May 20, 2018, lacks legitimacy due to the lack of participation of all Venezuelan political actors, without the presence of independent international observers, or the guarantees and standards necessary for a free, fair and transparent process," the statement read.
The signatories, part of the so-called Lima Group -- a multilateral working group of Latin American countries plus Canada that organized to find a peaceful solution to the crisis in Venezuela -- urged Mr. Maduro not to assume the office, saying that the only way to restore democracy was for him to step aside.
Mr. Maduro's second term is set to begin next Thursday, but his re-election has been widely criticized as his country has fallen into political, economic and humanitarian crisis.
Political oppression, human rights abuses, high inflation and shortages of food and medicine have prompted millions to migrate, many to neighboring countries. In September, some of those neighbors urged the International Criminal Court to consider prosecuting senior officials in Venezuela.
The Lima Group on Friday also denounced the breakdown of the rule of law in Venezuela, saying that "only through the full restoration, as soon as possible, of democracy and respect for human rights" could the country recover.
While the United States is not part of the Lima Group, the State Department said Secretary of State Mike Pompeo participated in Friday's meeting by video conference.
Earlier this week, Mr. Pompeo toured Latin America, meeting with allied nations and discussing the situation in Venezuela.
On Tuesday, he met with the foreign minister of Peru to discuss putting pressure on Mr. Maduro "to return democracy and prosperity to the Venezuelan people," according to a spokesman for the State Department.
The next day, after Mr. Pompeo met with Brazil's foreign minister, the State Department issued a similar note saying the two talked about working together on challenges in the region, "including supporting the people of Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua in restoring their democratic governance and their human rights."
Mr. Pompeo also met with President IvÃ¡n Duque of Colombia to discuss intervention in Venezuela. Venezuela's Ministry of Foreign Affairs denounced that meeting and said both countries "seek to subjugate and violate the sovereignty and self-determination of the Venezuelan people."
Venezuela's government has long opposed what it sees as American interference in its affairs, particularly after President Trump's administration scaled up sanctions on critical officials and held secret meetings with rebellious military officers to discuss their plans to overthrow Mr. Maduro.
Jorge Arreaza, Venezuela's foreign minister, posted a vitriolic response on Twitter to reports that Mr. Pompeo had participated in the Lima Group meeting, saying that those involved were taking their orders from Mr. Trump.
He wrote: "What we have been affirming since the creation of this group of cartelized governments against Venezuela, which in theory does not belong to the US government: they meet to receive orders from @realDonaldTrump through @SecPompeo. What a display of humiliating subordination!"

Promise From Powell, Mixed With Defiance: 'We Will Be Patient'

Full text: ATLANTA -- Jerome H. Powell, the Federal Reserve chairman, said Friday that low inflation would allow the Fed to be "patient" in deciding whether to continue raising interest rates, a message welcomed by jittery investors.
The Fed is confronting an increasingly uncertain economic outlook. Falling stock prices, weakening global growth and concerns about President Trump's economic policies have set investors on edge and prompted warnings that the economic expansion is nearing its end. But measures of domestic economic activity remain strong, including Friday's report the economy added 312,000 jobs in December.
Mr. Powell's message on Friday was that the Fed can afford to watch and wait. He said the best available evidence suggested that the economy was still in good shape. But he also was at pains to reassure investors unsettled by his confident tone at his last news conference, in mid-December. He said that the Fed was watching for evidence of weakness, and that the health of the economy would ultimately determine the course of policy.
"With the muted inflation readings that we've seen coming in, we will be patient as we watch to see how the economy evolves," Mr. Powell said. The Fed predicted in December that it would raise rates twice in 2019, but Mr. Powell said the central bank was ready to change course "significantly if necessary."
The stock market, driven down on Thursday by concerns about growth, surged on Friday on the strength of the jobs data, and then kept climbing as Mr. Powell spoke. Investors who are worried about the growing economic impact of a trade war with China also hoped for progress toward a resolution when the Trump administration and Chinese officials hold meetings next week.
The S&P 500 rose 84.05 points to close at 2,531.94; the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury rose 0.11 points to close at 2.668 percent.
[Read more: The jobs data, and signs of flexibility at the Fed, helped stocks soar on Friday.]
Mr. Powell also defended the Fed's autonomy on Friday in the face of sharp attacks by Mr. Trump, who has complained to aides that the Fed's rate increases would undermine economic growth and "turn me into Hoover," a reference to the president during the Great Depression's early years.
Some of Mr. Trump's economic advisers, alarmed by his inquiries as to whether he has the power to fire Mr. Powell, want to arrange a meeting between the two men. Mr. Powell, under questioning by Neil Irwin, an economics writer at The New York Times, said that he was open to meeting with Mr. Trump, as Fed chairs have done with past presidents, but that no meeting had been scheduled.
He also said the Fed would make policy without regard to Mr. Trump's views. "I want the public to be assured that we have a strong culture, it's not a fragile one, it's not being disrupted," he said.
Asked if he would resign if Mr. Trump asked him to do so, Mr. Powell replied directly: "No."
Mr. Powell was joined onstage at the annual meeting of the American Economic Association by his immediate predecessors at the Fed, Janet L. Yellen and Ben S. Bernanke. Both of them criticized Mr. Trump's attacks as potentially damaging to the central bank, and therefore to the economy.
Strong economic growth fueled the Fed's decision to raise its benchmark rate four times in 2018, into a range from 2.25 percent to 2.5 percent. The rate, which had hovered near zero in the wake of the financial crisis a decade earlier, now sits at the lower end of the range that Fed officials consider a reasonable estimate of "neutrality," meaning that the central bank is neither encouraging nor discouraging economic growth.

Fed officials say the continued strength of the economy validates their management of monetary policy. "I think we're actually in a good spot," Loretta Mester, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, told CNBC on Friday, noting that job growth is strong and inflation is under control.
But critics, including Mr. Trump, have said the economy still needs the Fed's help. Inflation remains below the 2 percent annual pace the Fed regards as optimal, suggesting that the economy has room to grow, and workers are only beginning to reap the benefits of an expansion now in its 10th year.
Clouds also are gathering on the economic horizon. The Trump administration increased economic growth last year through large tax cuts and increased federal spending, but those benefits are waning. And Mr. Trump's trade war with China is beginning to be felt by American companies, like Apple and FedEx, which have warned that the tit-for-tat tariffs are pinching profits.
The Fed's decision to raise the benchmark rate at its most recent meeting, in mid-December, drove down stock prices and bond yields in a show of concern about the prospects for continued economic growth. Asset prices imply an expectation that the Fed will not raise interest rates at all during 2019.

Mr. Powell began his remarks by reiterating his view that the markets' concerns are overstated. He said that 2018 had been "a good year for the United States economy" and that the latest economic data suggested "ongoing momentum heading into 2019." Wall Street's pessimism, he said, is "well ahead of the data."
But the Fed chairman offered a different kind of relief to financial markets by emphasizing that the slow pace of inflation allows the Fed to postpone judgments about the resilience of the economic expansion.
Inflation was 1.8 percent during the 12 months that ended in November, the most recent available data. It is likely that inflation remained soft in December, marking the seventh straight year that prices rose by less than 2 percent.
And inflation would have been even weaker but for the impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs, according to a study published Friday by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Mr. Trump has repeatedly argued that the cost of the tariffs, which are taxes on imported goods, is being absorbed by Chinese exporters. But the study found that American consumers were paying a hefty price. The authors estimated that the tariffs added about 0.3 percentage points to the Consumer Price Index last year.
Job growth has remained strong, and wage growth has increased in recent months, but Mr. Powell said the Fed was on guard against rising prices, not rising wages. He said the strength of the labor market "does not raise concerns about too high inflation."
Michael Feroli, chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase, said Mr. Powell's remarks convinced him that the Fed would move more slowly in 2019. Mr. Feroli previously predicted three rate increases in 2019; he said he now expected the Fed to raise rates twice, in July and December.
"Powell's message was unmistakable," Mr. Feroli wrote in a note to clients.
Mr. Powell also sought to ease concerns in financial markets about the Fed's gradual reduction of its holdings of Treasuries and mortgage bonds, which it bought in large quantities during the financial crisis to help bolster the economy. Some analysts have argued that the Fed's retreat is exacerbating the current volatility in financial markets.
Mr. Powell said that the Fed disagreed but, returning to his theme for the day, that it was watching closely and willing to change its mind.
"If we ever came to the conclusion that any aspect of our plans was somehow interfering with our attainment of our statutory goals, we wouldn't hesitate to change it," he said.

Who's Afraid Of the Budget Deficit?

Full text: On Thursday, the best House speaker of modern times reclaimed her gavel, replacing one of the worst. It has taken the news media a very long time to appreciate the greatness of Nancy Pelosi, who saved Social Security from privatization, then was instrumental in gaining health insurance for 20 million Americans. And the media are still having a hard time facing up to the phoniness of their darling Paul Ryan, who, by the way, left office with a 12 percent favorable rating. But I think the narrative is finally, grudgingly, catching up with reality.
There's every reason to expect that Pelosi will once again be highly effective. But some progressive Democrats object to one of her initial moves -- and on the economics, and probably the politics, the critics are right.
The issue in question is "paygo," a rule requiring that increases in spending be matched by offsetting tax increases or cuts elsewhere.
You can argue that as a practical matter, the rule won't matter much if at all. On one side, paygo is the law, whether Democrats put it in their internal rules or not. On the other side, the law can fairly easily be waived, as happened after the G.O.P.'s huge 2017 tax cut was enacted.
But adopting the rule was a signal of Democratic priorities -- a statement that the party is deeply concerned about budget deficits and willing to cramp its other goals to address that concern. Is that a signal the party should really be sending?
The economics of crude, mechanical rules about budget deficits are clear: They're a really bad idea.
Deficit obsession was deeply destructive in the years that followed the global financial crisis, helping conservatives push for austerity measures that held back economic recovery for years. True, we no longer have a depressed economy, and austerity is a lot less destructive when the unemployment rate is less than 4 percent than it is when unemployment is more than 8 percent. But another recession will come, sooner or later -- probably sooner rather than later -- and a rigid budget rule will not be helpful when it does.
Furthermore, there are things the government should be spending money on even when jobs are plentiful -- things like fixing our deteriorating infrastructure and helping children get education, health care and adequate nutrition. Such spending has big long-run payoffs, even in purely monetary terms.
Meanwhile, the federal government can borrow money very cheaply -- the interest rate on inflation-protected 10-year bonds is only about 1 percent. These low borrowing costs, in turn, reflect what seems to be a persistent savings glut -- that is, the private sector wants to save more than it's willing to invest, even with very low interest rates.
Given this reality, why not put some of those excess savings to work in high-return public investments? Should we really refuse to spend money repairing sewer systems or providing child nutrition if doing so raises the deficit a bit, with only a minor impact on future interest costs?
But, you may say, isn't it politically important for Democrats to present themselves as the party of fiscal responsibility? I'm highly skeptical.
Consider budget history over the past generation. The story is very clear: When in power, Democrats make big efforts to balance the budget; when Republicans come in, they promptly blow the money on tax cuts for the wealthy. Yet polling consistently shows the G.O.P. with an edge on the question of which party is better at dealing with deficits.
Or consider what happened after Democrats enacted the Affordable Care Act, going to great lengths to pay for the additional benefits with tax increases and spending cuts. A majority of voters still believed that it increased the deficit. Reality doesn't seem to matter.
Anyway, the truth is that while voters may claim to care about the deficit, hardly any of them really do. For example, does anyone still believe that the Tea Party uprising was a protest against deficits? From the beginning, it was basically about race -- about the government spending money to help Those People. And that's true of a lot of what pretends to be fiscal conservatism.
In fact, even the deficit scolds who played such a big role in Beltway discourse during the Obama years seem oddly selective in their concerns about red ink. After all those proclamations that fiscal doom was coming any day now unless we cut spending on Social Security and Medicare, it's remarkable how muted their response has been to a huge, budget-busting tax cut. It's almost as if their real goal was shrinking social programs, not limiting national debt.
So am I saying that Democrats should completely ignore budget deficits? No; if and when they're ready to move on things like some form of Medicare for All, the sums will be so large that asking how they'll be paid for will be crucial.
But while fiscal prudence is always necessary, for Democrats to put spending in a straitjacket -- especially when Republicans have shown themselves completely irresponsible -- looks like a bad move.

Full text: ISTANBUL -- In a prominent spot on a shelf close to his desk, Fuat Tosyali keeps a reminder of what his life was like long before he became a steel magnate and one of the richest people in Turkey, with a penthouse office outside Istanbul and a Mercedes limousine parked out front.
It is a black and white photograph of a young man polishing a stovepipe.
The young man is Mr. Tosyali, and in many ways the photograph tells the story of how far the Turkish economy has come. Mr. Tosyali's road from poverty to wealth mirrors Turkey's journey from tattered former empire to Mediterranean powerhouse with growth rates to rival China, at least until the economy took a steep dive last summer.
In an interview in his office, which is furnished with ample couches covered in beige leather and a polished black coffee table the size of a double bed, Mr. Tosyali professed confidence despite a downturn that has been exacerbated by the punitive tariffs imposed on Turkish steel by the United States.
"This is my 51st year in the business," said Mr. Tosyali, 55, who began helping out his father's metalworking shop before he was old enough to go to school. "I have seen many crises."
"The economic turbulence is temporary," he said in a follow-up telephone interview. "As a company, we are aware of our strength. We know our country's economic strength, too."
Mr. Tosyali's bravado may sound odd given the events of the past year, when he and other Turkish business executives have been forced to cope with a plunge in the value of the lira, a sharp decline in consumer demand, and President Trump's 50 percent levies on steel imported from Turkey -- twice the size of tariffs imposed on Europe and other American allies.
The problems have put Turkey, which has the world's 17th-largest economy, high on the list of places where the next global financial crisis could start.
Many of Mr. Tosyali's peers are becoming more pessimistic. In growing numbers, Turkish entrepreneurs are leaving the country or transferring their wealth overseas because they fear that the country's economy could get much worse, or that their assets and freedoms could be seized by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's authoritarian government.
Not Mr. Tosyali. He said he planned a major new investment in steel production, although he declined to give details. "It is unforgivable to hide the money you made in Turkey by taking it abroad," he said.
Until recently at least, Turkey has been viewed as an economic success story, despite episodes of harrowing financial and political turmoil. Since the beginning of this century, poverty has fallen by half. The average resident of the country lives a quarter-century longer than his counterpart in the 1960s. The economy has grown more than a third since the 2008 financial crisis. In 2017 growth was more than 7 percent, putting Turkey on the cusp of becoming what the World Bank classifies as a "high income."
Entrepreneurs like Mr. Tosyali have benefited from the growth and helped generate the jobs and investment that kept it going.
The company now known as Tosyali Holding began in the Mediterranean port city of Iskenderun, near the border with Syria. The family metalworking shop was so tiny, Mr. Tosyali said, that it would take up only a corner of the office he occupies today in a neighborhood outside central Istanbul where the hills are dotted with new luxury apartment complexes.
Mr. Tosyali said that his father, Serif Tosyali, was illiterate and deeply ashamed of it. But he understood numbers and could gauge a piece of steel's thickness to a fraction of a millimeter just by holding it between his fingers.
When Fuat Tosyali was not in school -- his father insisted his children get an education -- he and his younger brothers Ayhan and Fatih helped hammer scrap metal into parts for stoves and boilers. Later, the family began producing enameled steel for the washing machines that more and more Turks could afford, and pipes for homes that increasingly had modern heat.
In 1994, the Tosyalis bought a factory in Iskenderun that produced iron used in construction. The acquisition positioned them to profit from a sustained building boom, started a steel-making empire that now includes 18 factories in Algeria, Montenegro and Turkey and helped transform the family's business into Turkey's biggest producer of steel pipes.
Mr. Tosyali attributes the success to hard work. He received a reporter on a Saturday morning and said he planned to spend the rest of the weekend visiting factories.
"We are working nonstop seven days, 24 hours," he said. "Not only me, all of my family."
After one of the country's most difficult years in two decades, it is unclear how the current chapter in the story of Turkey's rise will end. Will it fall victim to economic mismanagement by Mr. Erdogan's increasingly repressive government? Or will Turkish entrepreneurs like Mr. Tosyali once again demonstrate their instinct for survival?
Most economists expect things to get worse before they get better. "Everyone is anticipating a recession," said GÃ¼ven Sak, who leads the Economic Policy Research Foundation, a think tank based in Ankara.
There are a few hopeful signs. The lira, which was in danger of falling below 7 to the dollar in August, has recovered somewhat and was trading at about 5.30 to the dollar on Monday. Still, the Turkish currency lost 28 percent of its value in 2018.
In another positive development, inflation is retreating from the astronomical levels it had reached. The annual rate, which had climbed above 25 percent, fell below 22 percent in November after the Turkish central bank raised its benchmark interest rate to 24 percent.
The lira's decline is not all bad for steel makers. They earn revenue from exports in dollars but must pay many of their bills in devalued liras. That gives manufacturers a potential advantage in export markets, although those benefits are partly canceled out by the higher prices they must pay for imported raw materials.
But the drop is dangerous for Turkey's financial system. It is also a source of anxiety in Europe, where analysts and bank regulators fear that loans to Turkish businesses might not be repaid, which could destabilize banks like UniCredit of Italy that have significant holdings there.
In many cases Turkish banks have issued loans to businesses that must be repaid with dollars or euros. Banks are already reporting increases in troubled loans because companies that do not rely on exports and earn revenue in liras are having trouble servicing these foreign currency debts.
The Turkish economy began slowing markedly around the middle of 2018 in reaction to the financial stress. Economic output is expected to shrink 0.4 percent in 2019, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
Mr. Erdogan is not making things any easier. He has driven some business owners into exile for allegedly plotting with his opponents. Akin Ipek, another of Turkey's richest men, had holdings in mining and media before the government seized his conglomerate in 2015 while he was visiting London. Mr. Erdogan has also criticized the Turkish central bank for raising interest rates, a step that most economists considered the only way to corral inflation.
The government has responded with temporary measures like tax incentives for people who buy furniture, large appliances, cars and homes.
"Some precautions are being taken for industry," said Mr. Sak of the Economic Policy Research Foundation. "But these are Band-Aids, not the remedy."
Mr. Trump's policies are also weighing on the Turkish economy. In August, he set the tariff on steel imported from the company at 50 percent after Turkey detained Andrew Brunson, an American pastor. But the tariffs were kept in place even after a Turkish court freed Mr. Brunson in October.
"There was no explicit quid pro quo for the arrangements with the pastor," Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, told reporters in October. The statement seemed to contradict a message Mr. Trump had posted on Twitter in August, when he linked the tariffs to bad relations with Turkey.
Like many Turkish business leaders, Mr. Tosyali is reluctant to discuss politics.
"We truly respect the United States," he said. "Of course we would like to be there. If they don't want to buy our products we will respect that."
Mr. Tosyali noted that while Tosyali Holding may not be able to sell products to customers in the United States, it is buying from American companies. In 2017, the company formed a joint venture with Harsco Corporation in Pennsylvania to recycle scrap metal and waste products in Turkish factories.
As Mr. Tosyali sees it, the rough period now facing Turkey is another opportunity for entrepreneurs to demonstrate their fortitude. Tosyali Holding, he said, planned to take advantage of lower manufacturing costs to expand and put itself in position to gain market share when the crisis is over.
Other bosses "put their feet on the brakes, they cut the work force," Mr. Tosyali said. "We do the opposite."

Full text: President Trump has a well-documented problem telling the truth.
Fact checkers have compiled lists of all of Mr. Trump's falsehoods since he took office (The Washington Post counts over 7,500, and The Toronto Star over 3,900), rounded up his most egregious whoppers in year-end lists and scrutinized his claims in real time with television chyrons.
Here at The New York Times, we have also fact-checked countless campaign rallies, news conferences, interviews and Twitter posts. After nearly two years of assessing the accuracy of Mr. Trump's statements, we can draw some conclusions not just about the scale of the president's mendacity, but also about how he uses inaccurate claims to advance his agenda, criticize the news media and celebrate his achievements.
Repetition and Inflation
Mr. Trump refuses to correct most of his inaccurate claims, instead asserting them over and over again. They become, by sheer force of repetition, "alternative facts" and staples of his campaign rallies and speeches.
Examples abound. He has falsely characterized the December 2017 tax cuts as the "largest" or the "biggest" in American history over 100 times (several others were larger). He has misleadingly said over 90 times that his promised wall along the southern border is being built (construction has not begun on any new section). He has falsely accused Democrats of supporting "open borders" over 60 times (Democratic lawmakers support border security, but not his border wall). And he has lobbed over 250 inaccurate attacks on the investigation into Russian election interference.
Yet Mr. Trump does not rely on repetition alone. He also embellishes talking points to amplify his achievements.
Take his repeated fabrication about the construction of new steel mills. After his administration announced tariffs on steel and aluminum imports in March, the president claimed in June that United States Steel was "opening six new plants." A month later, the number rose to seven. He has also occasionally cited eight, possibly nine or a vague "many plants," and he claimed once that plants were "opening up literally on a daily basis." To date, United States Steel has yet to open or build one new plant, though the company has restarted idled components of some plants.
Mr. Trump often pairs his misleading claim that his border wall is being built with the statement that he received $1.6 billion from Congress to fund it -- though a spending bill from March stipulated that the money, for border security, could not be used for the wall. In August, he added another $1.6 billion to the count, with no evidence. And despite criticizing a spending bill passed in September for not appropriating any money for the wall, Mr. Trump told campaign rally audiences in Illinois, Texas and Mississippi in October that his administration had secured a "third $1.6 billion."
In some cases, true claims morph into false ones in Mr. Trump's telling. In December 2017, he was largely accurate in saying a military spending law would give troops the largest raise in eight years. In March, he then exaggerated that time frame to "over a decade." And in May, as he addressed Naval Academy graduates at Annapolis, Mr. Trump wrongly characterized the wage increase as not just the largest, but the "first in 10 years."
Shifting and Deflecting
In the face of controversy or criticism, Mr. Trump has defended initial falsehoods with additional dubious claims.
This approach is evident in his shifting statements about the payment that Michael D. Cohen, his former lawyer, made to a pornographic film actress to keep her from speaking about their alleged affair. In April, Mr. Trump falsely denied knowing about the payment.
After the F.B.I. raided Mr. Cohen's office, Mr. Trump acknowledged on Twitter in May that Mr. Cohen received reimbursement for the payment and asserted that it had nothing to do with his presidential campaign. Mr. Cohen would later tell prosecutors that he acted at Mr. Trump's direction and to influence the election.
After the release of an audio recording of the two men discussing a hush-money payment to another woman, Mr. Trump claimed in an August interview on "Fox & Friends" that he did not know about the payments until "later on" and that Mr. Cohen "made the deals." He then misleadingly compared Mr. Cohen's actions -- a willful violation of campaign finance law -- to a civil infraction incurred by former President Barack Obama's 2008 campaign.
By December, Mr. Trump's defense had shifted further: "I never directed Michael Cohen to break the law."
Misleading Vagueness and Fanciful Details
The president is known for being unscripted and loose with language, but he sometimes shows tactical restraint.
After Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh was confirmed to the Supreme Court and in the days before the midterm elections, Mr. Trump told rallygoers in Missouri that "the accuser admitted she never met him, she never saw him, he never touched her, talked to her, he had nothing to do with her, she made up the story, it was false accusations."
The omission of a name and the use of the words "the accuser" may give the misleading impression that Christine Blasey Ford, who testified to Congress that Justice Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her when they were teenagers, had recanted her account. But in fact, Mr. Trump was referring to another little-known accuser named Judy Munro-Leighton, who recanted her claim of sexual assault.
Mr. Trump also regales his audience with elaborate stories. Some -- like his tales of unnamed "strong" or "tough" men, miners or steelworkers crying and thanking him -- may have occurred but are impossible to verify.
Others, like his frequent attacks on Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, contain invented details. Not content with just accurately pointing out that Mr. Blumenthal falsely claimed to have served in Vietnam, Mr. Trump adds -- with no evidence -- that Mr. Blumenthal said he had "charged up Da Nang," dodged bullets and saved the lives of fellow soldiers.
Inventing Straw Men
The usual target of this particular strain of falsehoods is the news media, which Mr. Trump suggests purposely underestimates or misinterprets him.
Mr. Trump often lauds strong job growth under his watch and says that the "fake news" would have deemed such numbers "impossible" or "ridiculous" during the 2016 campaign. Yet he neglects to mention that the number of jobs added in the 22 months after his inauguration -- 4.2 million -- is lower than the 4.8 million jobs added in the 22 months before he took office, undermining the premise of his retrodiction.
In another example, Mr. Trump turned a hypothetical talking point first into a purported reality and then -- after headlines debunking his claim appeared -- into a joke that he implied reporters had failed to grasp.
At an October rally in Arizona, Mr. Trump criticized Democrats for allowing undocumented immigrants to apply for driver's licenses. "Next thing you know, they'll want to buy 'em a car," he speculated. "Then they'll say the car's not good enough, we want -- how about a Rolls-Royce?"
A day later, at a campaign rally in Nevada, Mr. Trump presented this theory as reality, telling supporters that Democrats wanted to give cars and licenses to undocumented immigrants in addition to free health care and education.
After the claim was debunked by news outlets, Mr. Trump responded by ridiculing the news media for mentioning the Rolls-Royce, which was not the actual subject of the fact checks.
"They said he gets a Pinocchio for that," Mr. Trump said to laughter at a campaign rally in Mississippi, referring to The Washington Post's rating system for false claims. "They got me!"

Four Questions for the Year Ahead

Full text: What's in store for the year ahead? Like all economists, I really don't know. But I can suggest some critical things to look out for.

Uncertainty abounds, especially about a few big policy questions. Here are four questions we may learn the answers to in the months to come.
When will the Fed stop?
Over the past year, the Federal Reserve has been raising its target for the federal funds rate, slowly and steadily. Its goal is to return interest rates to more normal levels, after a long period of roughly zero percent rates following the financial crisis and recession of 2008-9.
At some point, Fed policymakers will say they've done enough. But when? The data is offering conflicting signals.
On one hand, the labor market is tight, suggesting that inflation could be around the corner. According to the most recent reading of the employment cost index, wages and salaries for private industry are up 3 percent from a year earlier, marking the fastest growth since early 2008. Accelerating labor costs can be a precursor to rising inflation, which would call for more Fed tightening.
On the other hand, the yield curve is now relatively flat, meaning that long-term interest rates are close to short-term interest rates. If the Fed keeps tightening, short-term rates could rise above long-term rates, inverting the yield curve. An inverted yield curve is a leading indicator of a coming recession, which the Fed would like to avoid.
How will Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chairman, balance these risks? Stay tuned.
How will the trade shenanigans end?
President Trump's belligerent approach to our trading partners worries most economists, including his former economic advisers Stephen Moore and Arthur Laffer. Their recent book, "Trumponomics," is mostly a hagiography of Mr. Trump and his economic policies. But even Mr. Moore and Mr. Laffer part ways with the president on international trade. They write that he is playing a "high-stakes game of poker" and "if it doesn't work, the ramifications scare us to death."
I can imagine three possible endgames in Mr. Trump's trade skirmishes.
The best outcome is for the president to get some serious concessions from bad actors. For example, fearing worse outcomes like punitive tariffs, China might agree to start respecting American intellectual property.
A second, more likely outcome is that our trading partners accept some minor concessions, and Mr. Trump promotes the new agreements as magnificent deals and giant steps forward. This is what happened with the slightly updated Nafta, now rebranded as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.
The third and most worrisome possible outcome is an escalation of global tensions and a retreat from the principles of open trade that have promoted growth in the United States and abroad over the past half-century.
In other words, the open question about trade policy is whether Mr. Trump is crazy like a fox or just plain crazy.
Will someone pay attention to festering problems?
Some economic problems are like learning your house is infested with termites. You can delay dealing with the issue for a little while. But if you put it off indefinitely, the problem will only grow larger and more costly to solve.
Two such problems are global climate change from human carbon emissions and the looming fiscal imbalance as more baby boomers retire and start collecting Social Security and Medicare. These problems are hardly a secret, but few in Washington want to talk about them.
One approach is easy to envision. A tax on carbon emissions would encourage the movement toward cleaner energies and raise revenue for the public purse, helping address both problems.
This measure would be palatable to members of the American Economic Association. But the general public may be harder to convince. After all, the rioting in France last month was partly motivated by a modest increase in the tax on fuel.
For elected officials, the easiest approach is to let the next homeowner deal with the termites. But next year, the 2020 presidential campaign will start heating up. Maybe some candidate will try to stand out from the crowd by taking the politically risky strategy of acting like a responsible adult.
Which economic advisers will have the president's ear?
I am no fan of President Trump. But I must admit that he has some solid economic advisers. That is reassuring news if, as some fear, the economy hits the skids over the next couple of years.
Kevin Hassett, who heads the Council of Economic Advisers, is a fine economist. Larry Kudlow, who leads the National Economic Council, has spent more of his career as a TV personality than as a professional economist, but his instincts are good. Mr. Hassett and Mr. Kudlow are natural allies in White House policy debates.
But it is unclear how much the president listens to them. The problem is due in part to Mr. Trump's excessive confidence in his own judgments. Making matters worse is the role of Peter Navarro, a relatively unknown economist who became a presidential adviser because his idiosyncratic views on trade are consistent with Mr. Trump's isolationist leanings.
If there is one thing that characterizes this White House, however, it is fluidity in staffing and influence. I am rooting for the coming ascendancy of Mr. Hassett and Mr. Kudlow. This is more a hope than a forecast. But I try to start every year on an optimistic note.

Full text: KHARTOUM, Sudan -- The civil war in Darfur robbed Hager Shomo Ahmed of almost any hope. Raiders had stolen his family's cattle, and a dozen years of bloodshed had left his parents destitute.
Then, around the end of 2016, Saudi Arabia offered a lifeline: The kingdom would pay as much as $10,000 if Hager joined its forces fighting 1,200 miles away in Yemen.
Hager, 14 at the time, could not find Yemen on a map, and his mother was appalled. He had survived one horrific civil war -- how could his parents toss him into another? But the family overruled her.
"Families know that the only way their lives will change is if their sons join the war and bring them back money," Hager said in an interview last week in the capital, Khartoum, a few days after his 16th birthday.
The United Nations has called the war in Yemen the world's worst humanitarian crisis. An intermittent blockade by the Saudis and their partners in the United Arab Emirates has pushed as many as 12 million people to the brink of starvation, killing some 85,000 children, according to aid groups.
Led by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudis say they are battling to rescue Yemen from a hostile faction backed by Iran. But to do it, the Saudis have used their vast oil wealth to outsource the war, mainly by hiring what Sudanese soldiers say are tens of thousands of desperate survivors of the conflict in Darfur to fight, many of them children.
At any time for nearly four years as many as 14,000 Sudanese militiamen have been fighting in Yemen in tandem with the local militia aligned with the Saudis, according to several Sudanese fighters who have returned and Sudanese lawmakers who are attempting to track it. Hundreds, at least, have died there.
Almost all the Sudanese fighters appear to come from the battle-scarred and impoverished region of Darfur, where some 300,000 people were killed and 1.2 million displaced during a dozen years of conflict over diminishing arable land and other scarce resources.
Most belong to the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, a tribal militia previously known as the Janjaweed. They were blamed for the systematic rape of women and girls, indiscriminate killing and other war crimes during Darfur's conflict, and veterans involved in those horrors are now leading their deployment to Yemen -- albeit in a more formal and structured campaign.
Some families are so eager for the money that they bribe militia officers to let their sons go fight. Many are ages 14 to 17. In interviews, five fighters who have returned from Yemen and another about to depart said that children made up at least 20 percent of their units. Two said children were more than 40 percent.
To keep a safe distance from the battle lines, their Saudi or Emirati overseers commanded the Sudanese fighters almost exclusively by remote control, directing them to attack or retreat through radio headsets and GPS systems provided to the Sudanese officers in charge of each unit, the fighters all said.
"The Saudis told us what to do through the telephones and devices," said Mohamed Suleiman al-Fadil, a 28-year-old member of the Bani Hussein tribe who returned from Yemen at the end of last year. "They never fought with us."
"The Saudis would give us a phone call and then pull back," agreed Ahmed, 25, a member of the Awlad Zeid tribe who fought near Hudaydah this year and who did not want his full name published for fear of government retaliation. "They treat the Sudanese like their firewood."
A few thousand Emiratis are based around the port of Aden. But the rest of the coalition the Saudis and Emiratis have assembled is united mainly by dependence on their financial aid.
The Pakistani military, despite a parliamentary vote blocking its participation, has quietly dispatched 1,000 soldiers to bolster Saudi forces inside the kingdom. Jordan has deployed jets and military advisers. Both governments rely heavily on aid from the Gulf monarchies. (A report by a United Nations panel suggested Eritrea may have sent about 400 troops as well.)
But in Sudan, which has played a far larger role, the Saudi money appears to flow directly to the fighters -- or mercenaries, as critics call them. It benefits the economy only indirectly.
"People are desperate. They are fighting in Yemen because they know that in Sudan they don't have a future," said Hafiz Ismail Mohamed, a former banker, economic consultant and critic of the government. "We are exporting soldiers to fight like they are a commodity we are exchanging for foreign currency."
A spokesman for the Saudi-led military coalition said in a statement that it was fighting to restore the internationally recognized government of Yemen and that coalition forces upheld all international humanitarian and human rights laws, including "abstaining from child recruitment."
"The allegations that there are children among the ranks of the Sudanese forces are fictitious and unfounded," the spokesman, Turki al-Malki, said in the statement. Saudi officials said their soldiers have also died in Yemen, but declined to disclose how many.
The Sudanese ground troops unquestionably have made it easier for the Saudis and Emiratis to extend the war. The Sudanese have insulated the Saudis and Emiratis from the casualties that might test the patience of families at home.
The Sudanese are sometimes deployed to defend the flanks of the Yemeni militiamen who spearhead attacks. But the Sudanese fighters insist they are also the main barrier against the Saudis' Yemeni foes, the Houthis.
"Without us, the Houthis would take all of Saudi Arabia, including Mecca," Mr. Fadil said.
Ambassador Babikir Elsiddig Elamin, a spokesman for Sudan's Foreign Ministry, declined to comment on troop levels, casualties or paychecks in Yemen. He said that Sudan was fighting "in the interest of regional peace and stability."
"Other than that," he added, "we don't have any national interest in Yemen."
Sudan's defense minister threatened last May to withdraw from the conflict, pointedly announcing that Khartoum was "reassessing" participation in light of Sudan's "stability and interests." Diplomats called the statement a veiled demand that Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates provide more financial assistance.
They did not, and the Sudanese economy teetered.
Khartoum backed down. The flow of fighters continued.
But President Omar al-Bashir of Sudan has gained valuable allies, easing his international isolation after years as a virtual pariah.
The United States has designated Mr. Bashir's government a state sponsor of terrorism for more than two decades. The International Criminal Court has issued warrants for his arrest, charging him with directing the Darfur war crimes.
Until recently, the Saudis and Emirates kept their distance, suspicious of Mr. Bashir's roots in political Islam and relations with Iran and Qatar, both Saudi rivals.
The war in Yemen, however, has enabled Mr. Bashir to win at least diplomatic support from its Gulf leaders, and he has thanked the Saudis and Emiratis for pressing Washington to upgrade relations.
The Saudi payments to the soldiers have become increasingly significant to Sudan, where inflation has hit 70 percent and even in the capital residents line up for bread, fuel and bank withdrawals. At least nine people have been killed this month by security forces.
Darfur has furnished mercenaries to other conflicts as well.
Rebel groups who fought the Janjaweed have turned up fighting in Libya for the anti-Islamist Gen. Khalifa Hifter, according to the findings of a United Nations panel and other reports.
But far more have fought in Yemen.
The five fighters who had returned from Yemen and two brothers of fighters who died there all gave similar accounts. Sudanese jets departed Khartoum or Nyala, Darfur, carrying 2,000 to 3,000 soldiers at a time to Saudi Arabia.
They were delivered to camps inside the kingdom, where some said they saw as many as 8,000 Sudanese gathered.
The Saudis issued them uniforms and weapons, which the Sudanese fighters believed were American made. Then Saudi officers provided two to four weeks of training, mainly in assembling and cleaning their guns.
Finally, they were divided into units of 500 to 750 fighters, they said. Then they traveled over land to Yemen, to battles in the Midi Desert, the Khalid ibn Walid camp in Taiz, or around Aden and Hudaydah.
All said they fought only for money. They were paid in Saudi riyals, the equivalent of about $480 a month for a 14-year-old novice to about $530 a month for an experienced Janjaweed officer. They received an additional $185 to $285 for any month they saw combat -- every month for some.
Their payments were deposited directly into the Faisal Islamic Bank of Sudan, partly owned by Saudis. At the end of a six-month rotation, each fighter also received a one-time payment of at least 700,000 Sudanese pounds -- roughly $10,000 at the current official exchange rate.
By comparison, a Sudanese doctor working overtime at multiple jobs might earn the equivalent of $500 a month, said Mr. Mohamed, the economic consultant.
Abdul Raheem, a 32-year-old member of the Rezeigat tribe whose full name was withheld to prevent reprisals, said that last year his family paid a local militia leader a bribe worth $1,360 so an older brother could go to Yemen as an officer.
The brother, Abdul Rahman, died in combat in February 2018. "Life is like that," Abdul Raheem said, stone-faced.
Abdul Rahman's wife and three children received the equivalent of $35,000 in Sudanese pounds, although banking restrictions have hindered access to it.
Some Sudanese officers had told the soldiers explicitly, "Don't fight harder than the money is worth, don't fight more than you are paid for," recalled Ahmed, of the Awlad Zeid tribe.
All the fighters complained of Houthi rockets and mines, and they recounted casualty levels ranging from 135 in Mr. Fadil's unit to about 200 in Ahmed's. When they returned they bought livestock, a Korean-made pickup truck or a small grocery store.
Hager, who went to Yemen at 14 and returned in November 2017, wore a matching khaki shirt and pants to an interview in Khartoum. His cheeks were clean. His mustache was just beginning.
His unit lost 20 men during their overland journey to a camp near Aden, where they lost 22 more in a first battle and 35 in a second -- 180 after six months.
He had been terrified every day, he said, hunching forward in his seat when he talked about combat. But his Sudanese officers let him call his parents from time to time, and now they are happy. Besides a house, he bought the family 10 cattle.

Full text: As 2018 draws to an end, we're seeing many articles about the state of the economy. What I'd like to do, however, is talk about something different -- the state of economics, at least as it relates to the political situation. And that state is not good: The bad faith that dominates conservative politics at every level is infecting right-leaning economists, too.
This is sad, but it's also pathetic. For even as once-respected economists abase themselves in the face of Trumpism, the G.O.P. is making it ever clearer that their services aren't wanted, that only hacks need apply.
What you need to know when talking about economics and politics is that there are three kinds of economist in modern America: liberal professional economists, conservative professional economists and professional conservative economists.
By "liberal professional economists" I mean researchers who try to understand the economy as best they can, but who, being human, also have political preferences, which in their case puts them on the left side of the U.S. political spectrum, although usually only modestly left of center. Conservative professional economists are their counterparts on the center right.
Professional conservative economists are something quite different. They're people who even center-right professionals consider charlatans and cranks; they make a living by pretending to do actual economics -- often incompetently -- but are actually just propagandists. And no, there isn't really a corresponding category on the other side, in part because the billionaires who finance such propaganda are much more likely to be on the right than on the left.
But let me leave the pure hacks on one side for a moment, and talk about the people who at least used to seem to be trying to do real economics.
Do economists' political preferences shape their research? They surely affect the choice of subject: Liberals are more likely to be interested in rising inequality or the economics of climate change than conservatives. And human nature being what it is, some of them -- O.K., of us -- occasionally engage in motivated reasoning, reaching conclusions that cater to their politics.
I used to believe, however, that such lapses were the exception, not the rule, and the liberal economists I know try hard to avoid falling into that trap, and apologize when they do.
But do conservative economists do the same? Increasingly, the answer seems to be no, at least for those who play a prominent role in public discourse.
Even during the Obama years, it was striking how many well-known Republican-leaning economists followed the party line on economic policy, even when that party line was in conflict with the nonpolitical professional consensus.
Thus, when a Democrat was in the White House, G.O.P. politicians opposed anything that might mitigate the costs of the 2008 financial crisis and its aftermath; so did many economists. Most famously, in 2010 a who's who of Republican economists denounced the efforts of the Federal Reserve to fight unemployment, warning that they risked "currency debasement and inflation."
Were these economists arguing in good faith? Even at the time, there were good reasons to suspect otherwise. For one thing, those terrible, irresponsible Fed actions were pretty much exactly what Milton Friedman prescribed for depressed economies. For another, some of those Fed critics engaged in Donald Trump-like conspiracy theorizing, accusing the Fed of printing money, not to help the economy, but to "bail out fiscal policy," i.e., to help Barack Obama.
It was also telling that none of the economists who warned, wrongly, about looming inflation were willing to admit their error after the fact.
But the real test came after 2016. A complete cynic might have expected economists who denounced budget deficits and easy money under a Democrat to suddenly reverse position under a Republican president.
And that total cynic would have been exactly right. After years of hysteria about the evils of debt, establishment Republican economists enthusiastically endorsed a budget-busting tax cut. After denouncing easy-money policies when unemployment was sky-high, some echoed Trump's demands for low interest rates with unemployment under 4 percent -- and the rest remained conspicuously silent.
What explains this epidemic of bad faith? Some of it is clearly ambition on the part of conservative economists still hoping for high-profile appointments. Some of it, I suspect, may be just the desire to stay on the inside with powerful people.
But there's something pathetic about this professional self-abasement, because the rewards center-right economists long for haven't come, and never will.
It's not just that Trump has assembled an administration of the worst and the dimmest. The truth is that the modern G.O.P. doesn't want to hear from serious economists, whatever their politics. It prefers charlatans and cranks, who are its kind of people.
So what we've learned about economics these past two years is that many conservative economists were, in fact, willing to compromise their professional ethics for political ends -- and that they sold their integrity for nothing.

Full text: There was a point in early 2018 when big American companies couldn't stop talking about the Trump tax cuts. Flush with the projected savings from a $1.5 trillion law, they promised to raise wages, hand out bonuses to workers and invest in big projects. They scored headlines, along with applause from President Trump.
The fawning faded quickly. Analysts noted that the handouts to workers amounted to a relatively small share of the roughly $200 billion in federal income taxes that corporations avoided thanks to the cuts. Wages across the economy ticked up, but not by nearly as much as some Republicans had promised when they voted for the law. Capital investment surged at the start of the year, but the rate of growth fell sharply in the third quarter.
Stock buybacks by publicly traded companies continue to set records. They neared $200 billion in the third quarter for S&P 500 companies. Goldman Sachs analysts have predicted that the total amount of buybacks across the economy could top $1 trillion for the full year.
Some workers did reap rewards from the law, as many companies followed through on -- and even exceeded -- their promises to raise wages and pay bonuses. Yet other firms have announced layoffs, despite reporting higher profits and billions of dollars in tax savings.
While the long-term effects remain to be seen, the evidence so far does not suggest the sustained investment and productivity growth boosts that Republicans and supply-side economists predicted. Many economists, including those at the Federal Reserve, are cutting their growth forecasts for 2019, in part because of the waning effect of the tax cuts.
Here's a look at what companies promised and what has come to pass as we head into Year Two of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
The tax cuts boosted profits for big companies
Corporate earnings over the last several quarters show why companies were such enthusiastic cheerleaders of the tax cuts. By cutting the corporate rate to 21 percent from a high of 35 percent, the law has reduced the effective tax rate that many companies pay.
That has fueled after-tax corporate profits, which rose nearly 20 percent in the third quarter from the previous year. The tax law was clearly a driver of that increase -- because profits before taxes rose at a much slower rate. In the last half-century of the American economy, it's been rare for after-tax profits to grow so much faster than before-tax profits; usually, it happens only around recessions, when companies rack up operating losses they can use to reduce tax bills. But the economy is on track to grow at about a 3 percent clip this year, after adjusting for inflation.
Walmart has so far saved at least $1.6 billion for the first three quarters of 2018, compared with what it would have paid under its previous effective rate. Bank of America has saved at least $2.4 billion over the same period. AT&T has saved $2.2 billion; Verizon has saved $1.75 billion and Apple has saved about $4.5 billion. In welcoming those windfalls, companies frequently promised to help workers.
"This tax reform will drive economic growth and create good-paying jobs," Randall Stephenson, the chairman and chief executive of AT&T, said last year, as the company announced plans to award worker bonuses and increase capital spending.
Bank of America's chief executive, Brian Moynihan, told workers in a memo last year that the new law would reduce the bank's tax rate, and that "in the spirit of shared success, we intend to pass some of those benefits along immediately" to workers.
Some companies added workers and raised wages, while others cut jobs.
Job creation accelerated across the economy this year, compared to 2017, including at several large companies that celebrated the tax cuts by expanding hiring plans. But strong growth has not spared the jobs of thousands of American workers at large companies where executives have cited automation, outsourcing and product-line restructuring to explain why they reduced employment in a year when tax cuts raised their profit margins.
After the law was approved, Apple promised to add 20,000 domestic jobs over the next five years, along with making other investments in the United States. So far, it is on track: It added 6,000 employees in 2018. (It also announced a $100 billion stock buyback program and a dividend increase worth $2 billion.)
Walmart increased its starting wage to $11 an hour, gave bonuses of up to $1,000 each for associates and expanded some worker benefits like parental leave. The wage increase amounted to $300 million more than the company had planned before the cuts. Its employment levels have not changed over the year.
Other companies have cut workers, even as they enjoy high profits and big tax windfalls. Bank of America gave bonuses of $1,000 last year, which it attributed to the law, and said this fall that soaring profits will spur a second round of bonuses. Its dividend recently jumped by 44 percent, and it has announced $20 billion in stock buybacks since the law passed.
Yet financial filings show it has cut 5,000 jobs this year, continuing a downward employment trend that dates to 2010, when Mr. Moynihan took over as chief executive. Technological changes, including a rise in mobile banking, have resulted in 100,000 jobs being eliminated during his time at the helm, Mr. Moynihan said this year.
Another bank that reaped billions from the cuts, Wells Fargo, said this fall it plans to reduce its work force by up to 10 percent, citing changes in customer demands. Wells Fargo has announced $40 billion in stock buybacks since the law passed.
AT&T handed out $200 million in worker bonuses and contributed $800 million to its employee and retiree medical trust fund. It increased its dividend for the 35th straight year.
It also appears to be shedding employees. Officials at the Communications Workers of America, the union that represents AT&T workers, say the company has cut more than 10,000 union jobs this year, accelerating its pace of cuts from last year.
Verizon has cut 3,100 positions this year, financial filings show. The company announced this month that 10,000 more workers have accepted a buyout offer as part of an effort to reduce its headcount while ramping up its push into the next generation of wireless technology, known as 5G. This fall, Verizon reached a deal to transfer about 2,500 jobs to Infosys, a large Indian technology outsourcing company.
Verizon has paid down corporate debt by $4.2 billion this year, as it said it would after the tax law passed, and granted employees 50 shares of Verizon stock, a move worth more than $400 million.
Business investment growth has slowed
Apple, Walmart and other large companies have increased their capital investment after the tax cuts, as have businesses across the economy. Nonresidential fixed investment spending grew 11.5 percent in the first quarter of the year and 8.7 percent in the second.
But growth fell to 2.5 percent in the third quarter, coinciding with a slide in oil prices -- which have disproportionately driven investment growth under Mr. Trump, compared to his recent predecessors.
White House officials predict that investment growth will bounce back next year, driving further productivity gains and lifting wages for workers, based in part on the high levels of planned investment that many business surveys continue to forecast.
"What we expect to see from the second part of the tax bill, which is the lower cost to capital and the higher investment, is just higher wage growth that's sustained," Kevin A. Hassett, the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, recently told reporters.
American workers aren't feeling happier about the law -- but companies are talking about it again
That bonus wave appeared to, very briefly, buoy public opinion of the tax cuts. The law's popularity peaked at a 51 percent approval rating in February -- after most of the announcements had just been made -- in polling conducted by the online research platform SurveyMonkey for The New York Times.
That favor has receded. In December, SurveyMonkey found, 47 percent of Americans approved of the law, while 46 percent disapproved. Republicans still praise the law and its benefits to businesses in floor speeches and news releases, but they did not make it a dominant campaign issue in November's midterm elections. Support for the law, odd as it may seem, has fallen slightly from the peak among Republicans -- and risen slightly among Democrats.
Overall economic confidence was higher in the 2018 surveys than in 2017, but "I don't know whether we can attribute that to the tax reform passage," said Laura Wronksi, one of the SurveyMonkey pollsters. She noted that Republicans have grown more economically optimistic even as their support for the law has fallen.
Mr. Hassett said -- as most economists have long predicted -- that he did not expect to see this year's wave of bonus announcements repeated next year. Few companies have followed Bank of America in announcing another batch of them.
But companies are still talking about the law -- at least to shareholders. An analysis of earnings calls by Hamilton Place Strategies found that in the third quarter of this year, large companies discussed tax reform more than any policy topic, including the tariffs that have dominated headlines and market anxiety for the past several months.

Full text: There's a saying, now associated with the investor Warren Buffett, that if you're playing poker for 30 minutes and you don't know who is the fool at the table, the fool is you. Since President Trump once owned casinos, you'd think that he might have caught on by now. Then again, those casinos went bankrupt, an outcome that Mr. Trump blamed on anyone not named Donald Trump.
Now that he's president, the table stakes are much higher. Except that Americans are the ones who are losing. With the stock market at the brink of a bear territory since September, and the S.&P. 500 off about 10 percent this year, the president continues to insist in tweets, and in conversations with his economic advisers and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, that everything would be great -- if it was not for that meddlesome Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. "The only problem our economy has is the Fed," Mr. Trump ranted on Monday. "They don't have a feel for the Market."
The Federal Reserve Board has had the temerity to do exactly what it had signaled for months it would do, steadily raise interest rates to prevent the economy from overheating. The Fed is legally mandated to maximize employment and contain inflation, not to prop up the stock market on presidential orders. Mr. Powell also signaled that the Fed would pause in this rate-raising mode if the economy began to slow. Wall Street was not surprised in the least by this pronouncement.
What surprised Wall Street -- what terrifies Wall Street -- was Mr. Trump's inquiry as to whether he had the power to fire Mr. Powell, whom he appointed in February. That injection of uncertainty was then magnified when Mr. Mnuchin announced from his Mexican vacation spot that he had chatted with six big bank C.E.O.s in an attempt to assure investors that there was adequate liquidity in the financial system. Anyone who experienced the Great Recession might recall that merely raising the idea that there might not be adequate liquidity immediately injects doubt into investors' minds about adequate liquidity, whatever assurances you attach afterward. The Dow promptly had its worst Christmas Eve trading day ever, disgorging 653 points, or 2.9 percent. After a slow start on Wednesday, major market indexes roared back, with the Dow climbing more than 1,000 points, or almost 5 percent.
Mr. Trump was in Iraq, and off Twitter, on Wednesday.
Mr. Trump is King Minus. Everything he touches turns to lead. And everyone else is at fault but him. He can't understand it. Didn't he give Mexico and Canada a great deal in replacing Nafta with Naft2? He thinks so, even though the Canadians fought furiously until they got an agreement they could live with; the Mexicans are still on the fence, if you'll pardon the pun.
And didn't he win the trade war with China? The president brays that jobs will be moving here from there, which will make the trade deficit diminish. The reality is that the trade deficit continues to climb, mostly because it helps our economy. What is diminishing instead are sales of soybeans to China, once the largest customer for American farmers. In November, China bought exactly zero soybeans from us. Merry Christmas, Iowa. Does this feel like winning?
In Mr. Trump's snow-globe reality, our days are merry and bright as long as he's in charge. It's only when those other fools interfere -- the courts, the Fed, Congress, whoever is chief of staff -- that things go wrong. Thus the government shutdown that he bragged he would own he now says belongs to the Democrats. No one is buying that one, not even in his own party. And no one is buying his $5 billion Mexico wall, either. And that includes the Mexicans. Nor should they. The number of people entering the United States from Mexico has been declining for a decade, but Mr. Trump has now wasted hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars placing American troops in Texas to protect us from an immigration threat that doesn't exist.
While a paralyzed federal government is not yet damaging the economy, the damage from Mr. Trump's other personal policy perversions is piling up. On its own, the economy, while clearly slowing, is doing well enough and will probably continue to do well enough with minimal fine tuning. Mr. Trump complains bitterly that Mr. Powell is going to turn him into Herbert Hoover by doing what the Fed is mandated to do. But what turned Hoover into Hoover is a Federal Reserve that did nothing and a Republican Congress that conducted a disastrous trade policy rife with tariffs.
The really scary part, if one continues this historical comparison, is that the Great Depression was ended not as much by smart economic policy as it was the end of a failed foreign policy marked by American isolationism in the years leading to World War II. Today, Mr. Trump's America First posture is behind his abrupt decision last week to withdraw antiterrorism troops from Syria. His own generals -- "my generals" -- and national security staff have warned that such a retreat could allow the shattered Islamic State to regroup and spread global chaos again.
But what do generals know about warfare? About as much as economists with Ph.D.s at the Fed know about the economy. That is, a lot.
Forced to forgo Florida and hunker down in the White House because of the government shutdown he orchestrated, Mr. Trump even managed to tarnish Christmas for one youngster. During a photo-op phone conversation, he called into question the 7-year-old's belief in Santa Claus.
Maybe the kid can now call Chairman Powell and commiserate, while the rest of us brace for King Minus's next touch.

In Big Bounce, Stocks Escape Bear Territory

Full text: Throughout Wall Street's December meltdown, analysts have been saying that markets were plunging despite plenty of evidence that the United States economy remains strong and corporate profit growth is healthy.
That argument finally found listeners on Wednesday, when early reports of a strong holiday-shopping season helped lift the S&P 500 by nearly 5 percent, its best day since 2009. The Nasdaq added 5.8 percent, and the Dow Jones industrial average rose just under 5 percent. That jump, over 1,086 points, represented the Dow's best single-session gain ever, although a number of days have eclipsed that in percentage terms.
A substantial rise in crude oil prices added to the lighter mood, as did efforts from the White House to ease up on criticism of the Federal Reserve.
The rally continued in Asia, led by Japan, where stocks on Thursday opened 3.7 percent higher.
The rebound in the United States offered investors a much-needed reprieve from a decline that had picked up speed in December. Stocks had fallen for four consecutive days through Monday, and the drop had pushed the S&P 500 to within just a few points of a bear market -- defined as a 20 percent retreat from its high.
Still, the S&P 500 is on pace for its worst annual performance since the financial crisis a decade ago and is only back to where it stood on Dec. 20. Plus, the move in prices Wednesday was most likely heightened by lighter-than-average trading volume during a holiday week.
But to some traders, the move upward finally made sense.
"Fundamentally you've got good growth here in the States, you have reasonable growth overseas, you're going to have record earnings in 2019 and possibly in 2020 as well, you've got low inflation," said Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute. Before Wednesday's steep rise, the market had fallen too far, Mr. Wren said, and it was ready to climb thanks to the underlying strength of the American economy.
The rally was broad-based. Only one stock in the S&P 500, Newmont Mining, fell.
Data from Mastercard showed that sales in the United States this holiday season grew at their fastest pace in six years, and investors flocked to the retail sector. Stock in the department store Kohl's jumped over 10 percent, and shares of Amazon, which called its season "record-breaking" without offering financial details, rose more than 9 percent.
Oil prices, too, were on the move after Russia's energy minister, Alexander Novak, told a Russian newspaper that the country would benefit from continuing to cooperate with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries on regulating production. American crude, the benchmark for oil prices, rose almost 9 percent to over $46 a barrel, and shares of large energy producers also climbed.
After leading Wall Street's recent slide, technology stocks rebounded as well. Tech investors have had plenty of causes for concern. A slowing global economy could hurt sales, tensions are rising with China on manufacturing of devices, and privacy concerns are bringing the potential for regulation. Apple shares rose 7 percent, while stock in the semiconductor maker Advanced Micro Devices gained 7.5 percent and Facebook added more than 8 percent.
Bank stocks, which have taken the brunt of recent selling as worries grew that the United States economy was weakening, rose significantly.
The rally doesn't mean that this year's precipitous decline in stock prices is over. Signs of economic health that encouraged the buying are doing little to address one of stock investors' primary concerns. They're worried that the Federal Reserve's decision to continue raising interest rates, even if at a slightly slower pace, will hurt the economy and corporate profits. Higher interest rates on bonds or even savings accounts make stock investments less appealing as an alternative.
The Fed announced an interest-rate increase last week and said it would continue to withdraw the support it had offered the economy in the wake of the financial crisis.
"The Fed is making a monumental mistake," said Barry Bannister, the head of institutional equity strategy at the broker Stifel. "They do not realize how long and by how much they've tightened already, and until they back off the market's going to have a very weak floor under it."
Adding to volatility has been the possibility that President Trump would consider firing the central bank's chairman, Jerome H. Powell, because he disagreed with Fed policy. Mr. Trump, who previously sought to hitch his political success to a rising stock market, has blamed interest-rate increases for the downturn on Wall Street.
White House officials insisted again that the president had no plans to fire Mr. Powell, news that reassured investors.
Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, told reporters Wednesday morning that Mr. Powell's job was "100 percent" safe. He echoed remarks by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Mick Mulvaney, Mr. Trump's incoming chief of staff, both of whom spent the weekend trying to persuade investors that the president did not plan to fire Mr. Powell. Those efforts had mostly backfired, in part because Mr. Trump continued to criticize his handpicked Fed chairman.
It also helped matters on Wednesday that Mr. Trump refrained from offering new criticism of the Fed, a marked difference from the days leading up to the Christmas holiday, when he railed against the central bank on Twitter and vowed to keep the government shut down for an extended period. In fact, for the first trading session in many days, Mr. Trump posted just one tweet: It was about his trip to Iraq.

Full text: TEHRAN -- Less than a year ago, he was running a thriving computer accessories business, driving a new car and renting a comfortable two-bedroom apartment in the center of Tehran. But last month, Kaveh Taymouri found himself riding a rusty motorcycle on his hourlong commute to his family's new lodgings, a 485-square-foot apartment in one of the city's worst neighborhoods, next to its sprawling cemetery.
When he arrived home one recent night at 10:30 from his new job at an arcade, there was no food on the stove. The sandwich he had for lunch would have to do.
Nevertheless, his wife and former business partner, Reihaneh, said she thought his mood was improving.
"At least he has stopped screaming in his sleep," she said.
Before their "downfall," as they call it, the Taymouris were the model middle-class Iranian family, prosperous college-educated business owners who made enough money to save for a down payment on their own home. Now, they are a model for a different sort: the millions of middle-class Iranians who almost overnight have seen their lives shrink, dragged down by economic forces beyond their control.
Iran's economy is in a shambles, savaged by years of mismanagement and renewed economic sanctions.
The government has expanded the money supply by more than 30 percent annually for more than a decade, using the extra cash to cover budget deficits and other expenses. In the United States, by comparison, a broad measure of the money supply has increased by an annual average of 6.4 percent over the last decade, according to the Federal Reserve.
As a result of Iran's rapid expansion of the money supply, says Djavad Salehi-Isfahani, a professor of economics at Virginia Tech University, inflation has exploded and by official figures is now running at an annual rate of 35 percent, compared with below 10 percent a year ago.
President Trump's decision to leave the nuclear deal, known formally as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or J.C.P.O.A., and to reimpose harsh economic sanctions prompted the other major economic disaster to befall Iran: a collapse in its currency, Mr. Salehi-Isfahani said. The rial lost about 70 percent against the dollar before strengthening recently, but its rates are still fluctuating heavily.
"The withdrawal busted the expectations for an economic boom created by the J.C.P.O.A. and Iran's return to the global economy, which was expected to boost oil exports and foreign investment," he said. "The reversal caused people to convert their rials into other assets, mainly dollars and gold."
By raising the cost of imports, the currency collapse has reinforced the inflationary surge and decimated small businesses that, like the Taymouris', rely on imported goods.
Mr. Taymouri, saying it was best to let his money -- or lack of it -- do the talking, sat down and calculated the financial calamity that had befallen the family in the past year. Their monthly income fell from 50 million rials, or about $1,400, a year ago to 10 million rials, or $90, at the current heavily devalued rate.
"If someone had ever told me I would one day live like this, I would've laughed," Mr. Taymouri said bitterly, before falling silent. Finally, his wife spoke.
"I'm not really that sad, because we are not alone," she said. "It's happening to so many people."
Mr. Taymouri attributed the fall in the currency to speculators as well as the government "for just having stood by." Others blame Mr. Trump.
"It's really because of Trump," said Nasim Marashi, the 29-year-old author of a best-selling book, "Autumn Is the Last Season." The book, on the lives of three middle-class young women in Tehran, has had 35 print runs in four years. "He left the nuclear agreement, not Iran."
Iran, with a population of about 80 million, has long had a large and thriving middle class, covering roughly everyone from bus drivers to lawyers and doctors, and earning an average of $700 a month in local currency, according to government officials. That income was frequently padded by unreported side businesses in the country's large black market and government subsidies that lowered the cost of utilities, food and gasoline.
Politically quite influential, Iran's middle class has consistently favored candidates like the current president, Hassan Rouhani, who support better relations with the West. But seldom have they been under as much economic pressure as they are today. Recently at least two people have been hanged after they were convicted in highly publicized trials for manipulating markets.
In a sign that the government is taking the issue seriously, Mr. Rouhani introduced his administration's budget on Tuesday, and it included more support for state employees and more subsidies on basic goods.
Not all have suffered as much as the Taymouris, whose business was so vulnerable to the currency collapse. But Abbas Torkan, a former adviser to Mr. Rouhani, said recently that the middle class had shrunk by 50 percent.
Even for those in higher income ranges, the difficult times have meant a sudden lifestyle change.
Royalties checks for Ms. Marashi's book dropped from 120 million rials a month to 20 million rials recently, she said. "Books aren't a necessity."
Outwardly, Tehran looks every bit the bustling metropolis it has been. New restaurants are still opening. An Iranian theater version of "Les MisÃ©rables" sells out every night for 3,500 people who pay the equivalent of $16 a person. But cracks are appearing.
In supermarkets, where the cost of Red Bull, for example, has quadrupled, people can be seen carefully studying the prices. Some imported products, like Purina pet food, have vanished entirely.
Along Tehran's high-end shopping district on Jordan Street, stores selling Western brands are shutting down. Rent increases are pushing people out of their longtime neighborhoods, and plane tickets to Europe now often cost two months' salary.
The pain many people are feeling may just be the start, said Faezeh Forouzan, an Iranian economist. "For the short term, those better off in the middle class will respond by changing their lifestyle, eliminating luxuries and excess," she said. "But in the future, all will suffer as a result of a lack of investment in creating jobs."
For the Taymouris, the pain was seemingly instantaneous. They met five years ago at work, and between stealing kisses by the copy machine, they figured out they could make more money with their own business selling computer accessories.
From their shop in the center of Tehran, the couple would buy keyboards, cables and other computer accessories from wholesalers. Ms. Taymouri would then resell them in the provinces, while her husband took care of the shop and short-term financing for the business.
A son was born, and just weeks before everything came crashing down, they happily informed their parents that they were expecting a second child.
But in January, the rial began to slide, and goods like the Taymouris' accessories that were priced in dollars and euros rapidly became unaffordable for most Iranians. Ms. Taymouri's phone stopped ringing, and sales orders dried up.
A Western Digital hard disk still costs around the equivalent of $90 in Iran, but in the local currency it soared to 18 million rials from 3 million, Ms. Taymouri said. "When your customers make only twice that a month," she added, "you can understand how our sales went down to zero."
At the same time, Mr. Taymouri was getting plenty of calls -- from the wholesalers he had bought accessories from on credit.
"They were asking for their money, but clients in the provinces weren't paying us back and we were not selling anything," he said.
One night, Ms. Taymouri said, "he just came home, dropped on the couch and said, 'It's over."'
In a country that still puts debtors in jail, the Taymouris had no choice but to make good on their debts. They sold the car, their furniture and the carpets they had been given as wedding presents.
Mr. Taymouri sold the shop to the arcade man on the condition that he could work there. Then they moved to their current apartment, which has a communal shower in the hallway.
"We don't like it here," he said, gesturing to the cemetery, one of the largest in the world. "We had been planning to move uptown, not next to the dead."
Mr. Taymouri brought out his infant daughter, Anita, from the tiny bedroom, and his wife started crying.
"I was just pregnant when everything suddenly turned upside down in our lives," she said. "I admit that I thought of having an abortion. But despite all of this, I'm so happy we have her now."
Even Iranians in the upper strata of the middle class, like Ms. Marashi, are feeling the pinch. Malmal, her white Persian cat, played in the background as Ms. Marashi's husband, a filmmaker, rummaged in the refrigerator.
"We are very lucky that we bought this house last year," she said. "Now, we would never be able to afford it."
In her book, the three main characters face setbacks after the anti-government protests of 2009. One gets fired from her job as a reporter, the other becomes depressed about society and the third dreams of emigration but cannot get a visa.
"Had I written the book now, there would be no reference to visas, as going abroad has become too expensive," she said. "Getting fired as a journalist is still possible, but more so because paper has gotten too expensive and publications are closing."
The couple had been planning a European tour around an award she had won in Italy, but a ticket now costs more than she makes in two months, she said. "So we canceled."
Still, Ms. Marashi said things could be worse, thinking of people who lived through the 1980s war with Iraq.
"We have had much harder times," she said.

Full text: For anyone closely watching the financial markets, the calm of Christmas on Tuesday was infused with anxiety.
Traders were bracing for the possibility of bad news on Wednesday, something bigger than just another day of stock market declines: If stocks don't reverse their recent sell-off, the United States is poised to close the books on the longest bull market on record.
The major benchmark stock indexes are nearing losses of more than 20 percent from their peaks, a bear market's official marker, which would end a nearly decade-long run of gains. From its high on Sept. 20, the S&P 500 is down 19.7 percent.
The market has reached this point after a rare downward streak this month -- stocks fell for four consecutive days through Monday. Investors have looked past evidence of economic strength, however, and toward a potential slowdown in 2019.
Messages from the White House over the long holiday weekend kept investors on edge. President Trump was repeatedly critical of his handpicked Federal Reserve chairman, Jerome H. Powell. In a Twitter post on Monday, he said, "The only problem our economy has is the Fed. They don't have a feel for the Market, they don't understand necessary Trade Wars or Strong Dollars or even Democrat Shutdowns over Borders." Top advisers, however, tamped down talk that the president was considering trying to fire him.
Furthermore, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin made an awkward attempt to calm markets with a statement on the health of the financial system. He said on Sunday that he had called bank executives to ensure the markets were functioning properly.
Those worries have joined other concerns, including weakness in global trade and the economic impact of a potentially lengthy government shutdown, to feed the volatility on Wall Street.
On Tuesday, Mr. Trump again expressed dissatisfaction with the Federal Reserve. Asked about Mr. Powell, he told reporters, "Well, we'll see. They're raising rates too fast. That's my opinion."
But in a seeming recognition that his criticism of the Fed is adding to jitters, the president noted that the recent decision to raise interest rates reflected the strength of the economy. "The fact is, the economy is doing so well that they raised interest rates, and that is a form of safety, in a way," he said.
And he urged Americans to buy stocks.
"I think it's a tremendous opportunity to buy," he said. "Really, a great opportunity to buy."
Initial reaction was positive. In Japan, where stocks slumped 5 percent on Tuesday, the market opened on Wednesday 1.5 percent higher.
But some investors remain cautious.
"The market has only gone down basically in a straight line for the last two weeks. It's healthy to have corrections but to have no reprieves and no rallies during that time isn't good," said Matthew Turk, an investor in San Diego who manages his own money.
Mr. Turk said he was "concerned" about what's in store for the markets on Wednesday. "It's not healthy. It feels like it's never-ending right now."
Charles Campbell, a managing director at MKM Partners, which provides trading services for big money managers like pension funds, hedge funds and mutual funds, said he began communicating with his clients at 6 a.m. on Christmas morning.
He hoped a recent article he had read, published by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, could offer some peace of mind. It suggested that inflation might be falling short of economists' forecasts, a data point that could persuade the Federal Reserve to keep rates lower for longer.
Mr. Campbell said the Fed's rate increases had been weighing on the markets. Investors were beginning to fear a slowdown and wanted to see more acknowledgment from the Fed that it would change course in the face of economic weakness.
Mr. Campbell said if the Fed did slow down its rate increases, it could provide relief the markets sorely need.
King Lip, the chief strategist at Baker Avenue Wealth Management, said he was looking toward big companies' earnings reports as a potential break from the bad news.
Public companies try to avoid surprising investors, offering plenty of hints about how their quarterly results will look, and Mr. Lip said the indications for some of the largest companies were still positive.
"We've been following what companies have been telling us over the last few weeks and generally what they've been saying has been pretty good," Mr. Lip said. The coming earnings season in January, he said, could bring a respite from the sell-off: "Even if we dip into bear-market territory, I think it's going to reverse."

'Regime Is Panicking': Sudanese Blame Bashir as Bread Prices Skyrocket

Full text: This was meant to be a new era for Sudan. Last year the United States ended two decades of sanctions that President Omar al-Bashir had long blamed for his country's poverty and isolation, a move that promised new investment, perhaps even an economic rebirth.
But when Mr. Bashir then ended fuel and wheat subsidies, at the suggestion of international lending partners, protests broke out.
And over the past week, festering public anger compounded by nearly 30 years of frustration over corruption and economic mismanagement has grown into demonstrations so big and widespread that some say they could topple Mr. Bashir's military government, or at least seriously challenge its legitimacy.
Sudan, a predominantly Arab country on the edge of sub-Saharan Africa, entered its sixth day of protests on Monday, with more planned later this week, including a mass procession to the presidential palace, an elaborate Chinese-built complex opened only three years ago.
The Sudanese Professional Association, the organization planning Tuesday's rally, said in a statement that it would submit a memorandum to the Parliament to "demand the regime to give up the political and executive power to the Sudanese people who flooded the cities with their sole demand to end the regime's 30 years of dictatorship."
Monday's demonstration, organized by doctors, followed days of violence during which security forces fired tear gas and at least nine people were killed, according to Amnesty International. Local journalists put the death toll much higher, saying up to 28 had perished in clashes.
The authorities have arrested 14 leaders of the National Consensus Forces, an opposition coalition, according to news reports citing its spokesman. The government has shut down internet service and social media sites, as well as universities and schools in the capital, in an apparent attempt to dissuade people from joining the protests.
"The regime is panicking," said Hafiz Ismail Mohamed, an activist with Justice Africa, a nongovernmental organization. "I have never seen them panicking like this."
Protests had begun spontaneously and without apparent leaders, he said, but now, people were organizing themselves into a movement.
A government spokeswoman said she would comment on the protests, but subsequent calls went unanswered.
Many Sudanese have described hundreds of people lining up just to buy bread, withdraw limited amounts of cash -- their salaries -- from bank machines or sleeping in their cars for two days waiting to fill up on gas.
Inflation has been so rampant, reaching an annual rate of 70 percent in November, according to government data, that many ordinary Sudanese can no longer spend money on meat or fuul, a staple food made of cooked fava beans. Some people now spend 40 percent of their income just on bread, Mr. Mohamed said.
Sudan has a long history of street uprisings, two of which brought down the government. Recently, the country saw protests over rising fuel and bread prices in 2013 and earlier this year, but they were largely contained in the capital and snuffed out by the security forces.
This time, the protests started in the eastern city of Atbara, a former locus of anticolonial and union activity. The demonstration then quickly spread to half a dozen cities.
"The Bashir regime has been facing a crisis of legitimacy," said Zachariah Mampilly, a professor of political science at Vassar College and the author of "Africa Uprising: Popular Protest and Political Change."
Last year's lifting of American sanctions came as the Trump administration said the Sudanese government had made progress on a number of issues, including counterterrorism.
The State Department also said the government had stopped attacking civilians and had improved in allowing humanitarian aid to reach troubled regions like Darfur, where Mr. Bashir's government stands accused of massacring hundreds of thousands of people in a genocide starting in 2003.
Washington said the country was also curbing its destabilizing activities in neighboring South Sudan, which split off as an independent nation in 2011. Sudan is also playing a central role in the United States-backed war in Yemen.
But the United States is still keeping Sudan on its list of terrorism sponsors, which means it will not be granted debt relief, a major drag on the economy.
The International Monetary Fund sent a team to Khartoum in July, and Sudan has started a series of reforms and austerity measures in line with its recommendations, including the removal of subsidies, to try to bolster the economy as it struggles with high inflation and a shortage of hard currency.
The monetary fund has not yet agreed to a loan -- one could follow further down the line -- but has committed to technical assistance.
"They thought they could address the economic crisis but could not foresee the political reaction" that the effort would cause, Mr. Mampilly said.
The measures by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank were designed to alleviate economic suffering, said Ahmed Soliman, an expert on the Horn of Africa at Chatham House, a London-based foreign affairs institute. "But in the short term they have been harmful," he added. "The subsidies were meant to stimulate growth and companies to trade and that's not happening."
In part, Sudan is still suffering from South Sudan's decision to secede, taking with it nearly 75 percent of Sudanese oil reserves. Until the secession, oil revenues consisted of more than half of Sudan's revenues, Mr. Soliman said, and about 90 percent of exports.
But the larger problem, many Sudanese say, is that Mr. Bashir's government, in power since a military coup in 1989, has not made any significant investments in infrastructure, agriculture or its people, though it has promised to build a museum recording the malign effects of American sanctions.
Only 7 percent of the national budget goes to the health sector, for example, compared to 75 percent to defense, security and salaries and perks for senior officials, said Mr. Mohamed, of Justice Africa. The elite has stolen a lot of the wealth too, he added, an accusation government officials have denied in the past.
"This regime has no ability to stop the protests by having economic reforms," he said, "because the structure of the economy is so corrupt that they don't have a clue how to run it."
"The regime has hit a wall," he added, "and they don't know what to do."

Full text: A 48-hour effort by the Trump administration to soothe jittery financial markets did little to reverse the free fall in stocks on Monday, as the president's renewed attack on the Federal Reserve and the specter of a prolonged government shutdown further rattled investors already worried about a global economic slowdown.
With a single tweet on Monday, President Trump undercut his top economic advisers' efforts to reassure the markets that he did not intend to fire Jerome H. Powell as Fed chairman. But Mr. Trump, who blames the Fed's recent interest rate increases for the market gyrations, said "the only problem our economy has is the Fed," an assertion that exacerbated the worst sell-off on Wall Street since the 2008 financial crisis.
Stocks continued marching toward their largest December declines since the 1930s, with the S&P 500 closing down 2.7 percent on Monday after a shortened trading session ahead of the Christmas holiday.
The markets are trying to digest the confusing signals from Washington. On Saturday, the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, posted what he said was a quote from Mr. Trump acknowledging that, while he did not agree with the Fed's recent interest rate increases, he did not have any plans to fire Mr. Powell. And Mick Mulvaney, Mr. Trump's incoming chief of staff, said on ABC's "This Week" that Mr. Trump now realized he lacked authority to fire Mr. Powell, his handpicked chairman.
For the markets, the Fed is a complicated player at the moment. Investors have been disappointed by rising interest rates, concerned that they could sap growth. But the speculation about firing Mr. Powell, a move that could turn the independent central bank into a political tool, has undermined confidence in a pivotal institution essential to economic policy.
Markets have already been on edge in recent weeks because of uncertainty surrounding trade negotiations between the United States and China, signs of slowing global growth, and the prospect of a prolonged government shutdown in the United States. Mr. Mnuchin added to the economic jitters by announcing on Sunday that he had called bank executives to ensure the markets were functioning properly, the type of discussions usually reserved for moments of crisis.
"It signaled a sense of panic and anxiety that didn't need to be there," said Brian Gardner, an analyst at the investment banking firm Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. "My first reaction when I heard it was, what has happened over the last couple of days that the market does not understand or realize? Is there something that Treasury knows that the rest of us don't?"
And while Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Mulvaney tried to reassure markets on the Fed's leadership, there is still an effort within the White House to discern whether any legal rationale exists for removing Mr. Powell from the chairman spot, according to two people familiar with the discussions.
Peter Navarro, Mr. Trump's top trade adviser, has been openly critical of the Fed's decision to raise interest rates and blamed the central bank for the market volatility. Mr. Mnuchin, meanwhile, has said the recent stock swings are the result of high-speed electronic trading and post-crisis financial rules that he says make it harder for banks to play their traditional market-stabilization role.
Mr. Trump on Monday made clear he is still not happy with Mr. Powell, likening the Fed to a "powerful golfer who can't score because he has no touch - he can't putt!"
Those attacks have drawn criticism from former Fed officials as well as lawmakers from both parties, who say that any attempt to turn the Fed into a political organ would undermine its credibility. Most developed nations have granted their central banks considerable autonomy over policymaking precisely because of concerns that politicians would seek to increase short-term growth at the expense of inflation and instability.
On Monday, Senator Jeff Flake, the retiring Arizona Republican, posted a photograph on Twitter of a 5-billion-dollar bank note from Zimbabwe and urged the president to back off.
"I've lived in countries where the Head of State has used the central bank for political purposes," he said. "Please respect the Fed's independence, Mr. President."
And Wall Street is bracing for more intervention from a president who views the stock market as a report card of his presidency. Henrietta Treyz, director of economic policy research at the investment advisory firm Veda Partners, spent her weekend studying the 1935 Banking Act to determine whether Mr. Trump could unseat Mr. Powell as chairman but keep him on the Fed board without violating the law. She has yet to determine whether that could pass legal muster.
Treasury officials tried to brush away criticism of Mr. Mnuchin's public statement and his calls to bank executives, saying he was trying to ensure that banks had ample liquidity for lending. But the conversations were described by several on the receiving end as more routine than the striking statement suggested.
The Treasury secretary asked for updates on how markets were functioning and inquired about any stresses in the system, according to one bank chief executive. Another bank C.E.O. was so unconcerned about the recent fall in stocks that he used his time with Mr. Mnuchin to discuss new capital requirements and how they could affect the bank's balance sheet in the long term as the Fed continues selling government securities it amassed during the financial crisis, according to a person with knowledge of the discussion.
Policymakers who participated in the President's Working Group call on Monday also described it as a routine meeting, with no market problems reported and nothing to warrant an official statement after the discussion. The call was described by a person familiar with the conversation as a "check-in" scheduled at the Treasury's request for officials so they could plan for a prolonged government shutdown.
Negotiations to end the partial government shutdown have remained at an impasse since midnight Friday when funding lapsed for a number of federal agencies and nine departments, including the Treasury. Neither chamber is expected to reconvene until Thursday, with House lawmakers looking to the Senate Democrats and Mr. Trump to reach a compromise over border security funding.
The decision to convene the working group, which became known as the Plunge Protection Team during the 2008 financial crisis, struck some former officials as curious given that its duties have mostly been taken over by the Financial Stability Oversight Council. That body, which was created by the 2010 Dodd-Frank law, held a public meeting last week when it also published its annual report, which had little mention of market concerns.
"Now that the administration has chosen this extremely rare policy approach of verbal intervention in the stock market its credibility is at risk should markets settle lower," said Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading.
Former Treasury officials said Mr. Mnuchin had probably amplified concerns about the markets by publicizing his efforts to calm them.
"I never heard anyone in any venue in the last two months voice any concerns about liquidity," said Paul H. O'Neill, who served as Treasury secretary under President George W. Bush, noting that Mr. Mnuchin had injected more uncertainty into the calculations of investors.
Mr. O'Neill also suggested that Mr. Mnuchin was in a difficult position in trying to assuage a mercurial boss and could be overcompensating to please him.
"The president apparently is blaming Mnuchin for the markets going south, which is a fairly strange thing," he said.
Sarah Bloom Raskin, a former deputy secretary of the Treasury under President Barack Obama and a former Fed governor, said Mr. Mnuchin would be better served keeping conversations about financial stability private.
"When you do something like that you've got to be really careful and quiet about it," Ms. Raskin said. "You run the risk of planting the seeds of doubt in people's minds."
But, Ms. Raskin suggested, Mr. Mnuchin could have been trying to show the president, who canceled his own Florida vacation, that he was working hard despite traveling with his children to a resort in Mexico.
"Maybe he's just worried because he's in Cabo, the markets are going down and the Treasury secretary is in another country and they don't like the optics of that," she said.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- President Trump has unabashedly hitched his political fortunes to a rising stock market. Now, with stock prices in retreat, he has become increasingly fixated on the idea that one man is to blame for the recent rout: Jerome H. Powell, chairman of the Federal Reserve.
After the Fed raised its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday, the fifth consecutive quarterly increase, Mr. Trump fretted to aides that Mr. Powell would "turn me into Hoover," a reference to the man who was president in the early years of the Great Depression.
Mr. Trump has said choosing Mr. Powell for the Fed job last year was the worst mistake of his presidency, and he has asked aides whether he has the power to fire him.
But the volatile stock market, which just posted its worst week since 2008, is falling in part because of Mr. Trump's own policies, including an escalating trade war with China, a shutdown of the federal government and the fading effects of the $1.5 trillion tax cut Mr. Trump ushered in at the end of 2017. While the Fed's rate increases have upset investors -- who seem to have a darker view of economic growth than the central bank does -- some analysts said Mr. Trump's musings about the Fed would only exacerbate anxieties.
"If Powell gets terminated, what we've seen happen in the markets in the past few weeks will look like a walk in the park," David Rosenberg, chief economist at Gluskin Sheff, said in an email on Sunday. "The dollar will go into a tailspin, and even confidence in the Treasury market will erode, especially among foreign creditors."
Mr. Trump's economic advisers scrambled over the weekend to reassure markets that Mr. Trump was not, in fact, planning to fire Mr. Powell. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin tweeted what he said was a quote from Mr. Trump accepting that he did not even have the power to do so.
"I totally disagree with Fed policy," Mr. Mnuchin quoted Mr. Trump as saying. "I think the increasing of interest rates and the shrinking of the Fed portfolio is an absolute terrible thing to do at this time, especially in light of my major trade negotiations which are ongoing, but I never suggested firing Chairman Jay Powell, nor do I believe I have the right to do so."
Mick Mulvaney, the incoming acting White House chief of staff, implied on Sunday that Mr. Trump had, in fact, inquired about removing Mr. Powell, saying on ABC's "This Week" that the president "now realizes he does not have the authority." But Mr. Mulvaney added that he had heard this from Mr. Mnuchin, not from Mr. Trump.
Mr. Trump has not addressed the issue directly, including on his own Twitter feed, which he has frequently used to criticize the Fed. The White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, told reporters on Saturday, "I'm aware of no plans to fire Mr. Powell" -- but that brief statement stopped well short of corroborating Mr. Mnuchin's account of the president's views.
Mr. Mnuchin has worked in recent days to obtain Mr. Trump's assurance that he would not remove Mr. Powell, according to an administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity. But that person cautioned that Mr. Trump could change his mind. The person noted Mr. Trump has a tendency to nurse grudges even when he temporarily sets a subject aside.
Mr. Mnuchin has been under pressure from Mr. Trump to stabilize markets, which are on pace for the largest December declines since the 1930s. In a statement Sunday, Mr. Mnuchin said he had contacted the chief executives of six major banks to make sure their operations were running smoothly.
Mr. Mnuchin, who made the calls while on vacation in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, said that bank executives confirmed they had sufficient liquidity for lending and market operations -- the kind of statement the government usually reserves for moments of genuine uncertainty about the health of the financial system. The statement added that Mr. Mnuchin would convene a meeting of the President's Working Group on financial markets, which he leads, to coordinate efforts to "assure normal market operations."
The Fed's unanimous decision to raise its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday reflected the confidence of its officials that the economy remains strong -- even as they insisted that future rate increases would depend on continued growth. By raising rates, the Fed is bringing to a close its long campaign of economic stimulus that began during the 2008 financial crisis, which included lowering interest rates to near zero.
Still, Mr. Trump is hardly alone in his opposition to the Fed's move. Some economists argue the Fed should continue its stimulus campaign to drive up employment and wages. They note that the Fed is about to undershoot its 2 percent inflation target for the seventh consecutive year, suggesting there is no need to step on the brakes.
Many investors had also wanted a pause, and the decision set off another slide in stock prices.
But even investors who disagreed with Wednesday's decision generally do not want politicians to play a larger role in Fed policymaking, preferring to leave the management of interest rates primarily in the hands of technocrats. Most developed nations have granted their central banks considerable autonomy over policymaking precisely because of concerns that politicians would seek to increase short-term growth at the expense of inflation and instability.
In fact, during his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump accused the Fed of getting political, saying that the bank's chairwoman at the time, Janet L. Yellen, should be "ashamed" for keeping interest rates low -- a move he said was meant to help President Barack Obama.
"Markets are in the business of looking forward, and looking forward to a world with greatly diminished central bank independence isn't something that markets should find comforting," Eric Winograd, senior United States economist at AllianceBernstein, said in an email.
Senators from both parties also warned the president against firing Mr. Powell. The president's deliberations on Mr. Powell's fate were first reported by Bloomberg News.
"I'd be very careful about doing that," Senator Richard Shelby, an Alabama Republican and a former chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, told reporters on Saturday. "The independence of the Fed is the foundation of our banking system."
Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, said, "Given the Fed's consensus on monetary policy, any effort to remove Powell would hit the trifecta: unlawful, ineffective and damaging to the economy."
A key question is whether Mr. Trump has the legal authority to remove Mr. Powell. The Federal Reserve Act, which had its 105th anniversary on Sunday, says the president can remove members of the Fed's board of governors, including Mr. Powell, only "for cause."
No president has ever tried, but legal scholars say the language is generally interpreted as meaning the president could not remove Mr. Powell over a policy disagreement.
The law, however, does not address the president's authority to remove Mr. Powell from his role as Fed chairman without removing him from the Fed's board, a move that some of the president's advisers have urged.
But it is far from clear such a decision would serve the president's purpose. A replacement for Mr. Powell would require Senate confirmation, and this person would join a policymaking committee that voted unanimously for the December rate increase. That committee also might be inclined, on future rate decisions, to demonstrate its independence from the president.
While Mr. Trump has turned on his chairman, the Fed's trajectory should not have been a surprise.
When Mr. Trump chose Mr. Powell as Fed chairman in the fall of 2017, he said, "Based on his record, I am confident that Jay has the wisdom and leadership to guide our economy through any challenges that our great economy may face."
Mr. Trump also chose three of the other four members of the Fed's board, all of whom joined Mr. Powell in voting for all four 2018 rate increases.
In conversations with friends and advisers, Mr. Trump has acknowledged responsibility for the selection of Mr. Powell. He told Stephen Moore, an economist at the Heritage Foundation, that it was "one of the worst choices I've ever made," according to Mr. Moore.
Some of Mr. Trump's economic advisers have encouraged him to remove Mr. Powell, arguing that the decision would reverse recent stock declines.
Others, including Mr. Mnuchin, have warned that Mr. Trump would harm his own interests.
Sarah Binder, a professor of political science at George Washington University, said presidents had often tried to shape Fed policy, but the current episode stood apart because Mr. Trump appeared to be acting against his own interest in a stable economy.
"I think what is the unusual part here is that it seems the president has created the crisis," she said. "His intervention certainly seems to be making things worse for him and worse for the Fed and worse for the economy. It's just very shortsighted, and we're not used to that."

Nike's Strong Earnings Ease Trade Woes
Nike Inc shares rose 8 percent on Friday, after the company's solid quarterly results eased worries that escalating trade tensions between Washington and Beijing would weigh on China demand and hurt the sportswear maker's growth story.
The company's double-digit percentage growth in China was in addition to strong demand in North America, Nike's biggest and most competitive market, where sales got a boost from higher full-priced sales and a rebound in Jordan sneakers.
Nike has focused on new launches as well as on a direct-to-customer model of its own stores and online sales to temper the hit from bankruptcies of sports retailers and competition from the likes of Adidas AG and Under Armour Inc. in the United States.
Its efforts have borne fruit. The company engineered a rebound in its North America market, clawing back market share from global rivals. REUTERS

Crippling Debts Delay Nigerian Power Plant
Plans to build another privately financed power station in Nigeria to help end decades of chronic blackouts have been delayed because of concerns about persistent shortfalls in payments for electricity across the sector.
The $1.1 billion Qua Iboe Power Plant being developed by energy infrastructure company Black Rhino and the state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation won't get a green light by the end of 2018 as planned and it was unclear when the deal might close, the state company told Reuters.
The delay is a setback for Africa's biggest oil producer where 80 million people don't have access to grid power supplies and it exposes the difficulties in attracting private investment to a sector that successive governments have tried to reform.
The uncertainty surrounding the 540-megawatt Qua Iboe plant stems from the difficulties Nigeria's first privately-financed independent power project -- the 460-megawatt Azura-Edo plant -- has encountered since it came online this year. REUTERS
ECONOMY
Consumer Spending Rose In November
Americans lifted their spending 0.4 percent in November from the previous month, a moderate gain that should sustain steady economic growth.
Personal incomes rose 0.2 percent, down from 0.5 percent in the previous month, the Commerce Department said Friday.
Consumer spending jumped by the most in 13 months in October, and November's solid gain on top of that points to healthy spending in the final three months of the year. Economists closely watch consumer spending because it accounts for about two-thirds of economic activity.
Business spending is showing signs of slowing, leaving more of the burden on consumers to power the economy. A gauge of business investment in large equipment such as machinery and computers fell in November for the third time in four months, according to a separate report Friday.
A measure of inflation tied to consumer purchases slipped, rising 1.8 percent from a year ago, down from last month's 2 percent annual gain. A.P.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- A senior Federal Reserve official sought to soothe financial markets on Friday, emphasizing that the Fed is paying attention to investors' concerns that the economic expansion is weakening.
John Williams, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, defended the Fed's decision to raise its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday, and said the central bank expected economic growth to remain strong enough that it would need to continue raising interest rates in 2019.
But he said plans were not promises and that, if the economy weakens, the Fed will adjust.
"We're going to go into the new year with eyes wide open, willing to read the data, listen to what we're hearing, reassess our economic outlook and take the right policy decisions that will keep this economy strong," Mr. Williams said in an interview with CNBC that aired shortly after markets opened on Friday.
The emphasis on flexibility drew an immediate reaction from investors. The S&P 500 stock index rose as Mr. Williams spoke, briefly posting a 1 percent gain. But Mr. Williams's message was not enough to reverse the downward momentum in equity markets, which have been rattled by the prospect of a government shutdown on top of global economic weakness and trade uncertainty. By the end of the day, the S&P index was down 2.1 percent to end the worst week for American equity markets since the 2008 financial crisis.
The contrast between the apparent strength of the domestic economy and the downturn in stock prices partly reflects the weakness of economic growth in foreign markets, where American companies reap a large share of their profits. It also reflects a striking divergence in views about the economic outlook.
The Fed expects economic growth to continue next year. Many equity investors appear to disagree.
So far, the data seems to be on the Fed's side. The Commerce Department reported on Friday that consumer spending remained strong in November, increasing for the ninth consecutive month. In the same report, it said that inflation had weakened modestly. The department's index of personal consumption expenditures rose by 1.8 percent over the 12 months through November.
The index is the Fed's preferred measure of inflation, and the latest reading indicates the central bank is likely to undershoot its target of 2 percent annual inflation for the seventh straight year.
Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont, said pessimism in financial markets was strikingly at odds with the latest economic data. "The consumer is on fire," Mr. Stanley wrote in a note to clients. "If the stock market is trying to signal that the U.S. economy is crumbling, Mr. Market is wrong."
In an interview, Mr. Stanley said that investors were also unduly concerned about the impact of the Fed's rate increases. The Fed's benchmark rate is now in a range of 2.25 percent to 2.5 percent, a level that Mr. Stanley said was still likely to provide a little stimulus to economic growth.
"I don't think the Fed is tapping the brakes yet," he said.
The White House, by contrast, continued to warn on Friday that the Fed was jeopardizing economic growth by repeatedly raising interest rates. Peter Navarro, the director of the president's National Trade Council, told the Japanese publication Nikkei Asian Review that the Fed's forecast of two rate increases next year was "two too many." Mr. Navarro added, "We don't understand why the Fed is acting so contractionary, at a time when there's no inflation to worry about."
While President Trump has also warned the Fed to stop raising rates, another White House official, Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, later disputed that Mr. Navarro spoke for the administration.
"I would not concur with Peter," Mr. Hassett told CNBC. "I think the appropriate position for an economist in the White House is to respect the independence of the Fed and not comment on their policies."
Mr. Williams's appearance on Friday morning was carefully calibrated. Fed officials are barred from speaking publicly about policy on the day after a policy meeting, so Friday offered the earliest opportunity to address the market's reaction to Wednesday's decision.
Mr. Williams is also the vice chairman of the Fed's policymaking committee, and a close adviser to the Fed's chairman, Jerome H. Powell, giving his words added weight.
The content of his remarks closely resembled the views that Mr. Powell offered at a Wednesday news conference that sent markets tumbling. He said that the Fed thought the economy was strong, and would remain strong, and that most Fed officials expected the central bank to raise rates twice in 2019.
But there was a marked difference in emphasis. Mr. Williams said several times that the Fed was aware that many investors had a bleaker outlook, and that economic conditions would dictate the Fed's decision.
"We are not sitting there thinking we know for sure what's going to happen," he said.
Mr. Williams also sought to make the case that investors had overlooked some of the nuances in the policy statement the Fed released on Wednesday. He noted that in previous statements the Fed said it "expects" to continue raising interest rates, while in the most recent statement it used the word "judges." This was intended to reflect increased uncertainty about the outlook, Mr. Williams said.
The Fed also included new language saying it would "continue to monitor global economic and financial developments and assess their implications for the economic outlook."

Full text: I have a confession to make: I have been insufficiently cynical about modern conservative economics.
Longtime readers may find this hard to believe. After all, I declared Paul Ryan a "flimflam man" back when all the cool kids were gushing about his courage and honesty, giving him awards for fiscal responsibility. (Events have settled the issue: Yes, he was and is a flimflam man.) I predicted early and often that Republican cries about the evils of debt would vanish as soon as they held the White House; sure enough, after forcing the U.S. into job-destroying austerity when the economy was weak, once in power they blew up the budget deficit with a tax cut for corporations and the wealthy, despite low unemployment.
But while I yield to nobody in my appreciation of the right's fiscal fraudulence, I took its monetary hawkishness seriously. I thought that all those dire warnings about the inflationary consequences of the Federal Reserve's efforts to fight high unemployment, the constant harping on the evils of printing money, were grounded in genuine -- stupid, but genuine -- concern.
Silly me.
It's no surprise that Individual-1, who lambasted the Fed for keeping interest rates low while Barack Obama was president, is demanding that it keep rates low now that he's in the White House. After all, nobody has ever accused Donald Trump of having consistent, principled views about monetary policy (or anything else).
But it is a shock to see so many conservative voices -- including, incredibly, the editorial page of The Wall Street Journal -- echoing Trump's demands.
It's hard to overstate just how consistent and intense The Journal and others of like mind used to be in their attacks on easy money. Many commentators have noted that three years ago The Journal declared that low interest rates are bad for the economy. But that was minor compared with the newspaper's pronouncements during the financial crisis. For example, it attacked and ridiculed Ben Bernanke for cutting interest rates in December 2008 -- that is, at a time when the economy was in free fall, and desperately needed all the support it could get.
Now, you might say that the explanation for the right's about-face on monetary policy is the same as the explanation of its about-face on deficits. That is, Republicans want pain and suffering when there's a Democratic president, but a nonstop party when one of their own sits in the White House. And that is indeed how it looks now. But I used to think there was something more to the story.
You see, as a pundit who, well, gets a lot of hate mail, I've learned that the issue of whether it sometimes makes sense to print money stirs more visceral emotions on the right than anything else. Declare that Trump is a corrupt Russian puppet, and you get a fair bit of blowback, but nothing like what you get if you say that returning to the gold standard would be a bad idea, or that monetary easing isn't necessarily inflationary. A lot of people on the right just go crazy at any suggestion that money is something to be managed, not treated as a sacred trust with which mortals must not meddle.
The only thing I know that brings comparable blowback is criticism of Bitcoin, a topic that combines some of the same libertarian derp with a hefty infusion of technobabble.
And the right's emotional response to Fed policy -- its hatred for using the printing press to boost the economy, no matter what the circumstances -- always seemed real to me. I never believed that Paul Ryan really cared about the deficit, but I did believe his assertion that his views on monetary policy were derived from the denunciation of paper money as a form of looting in Ayn Rand's "Atlas Shrugged."
Furthermore, the view that printing money is always a terrible thing seemed extremely durable, despite an uninterrupted track record of predictive failure. People who warned about looming inflation in 2009 continued to warn about it year after year, even as it kept not happening.
Then Trump decided to pressure the Fed, and many of the erstwhile hard-money men became easy-money men overnight. I mean that more or less literally. Consider the case of Kevin Warsh, a former member of the Federal Reserve Board who was for a time considered a likely Fed chairman. Up until two months ago he was always for higher interest rates -- but this week he suddenly wrote an op-ed article calling on the Fed to stop rate hikes.
There is, by the way, a reasonable case (which I accept) that the Fed should, indeed, pause its campaign of raising rates, and even that this week's hike was a mistake. But this case should be made on the basis of fundamental economic principles, not in pursuit of short-term political advantage, and least of all because it's what Donald Trump wants.
Yet that's how it's going. These days the G.O.P. is all about power; there are no principles it will adhere to if they involve any political cost. And it's a party that belongs to Trump: What he says is the party line, on any and every issue.
Trumpism, it turns out, trumps everything else -- even Ayn Rand.

Full text: KADI, India -- Vikram Singh is accustomed to life under the tyranny of elements he cannot control, from rains that do not fall to insects that tear at his crops. Lately one unchanging trouble is plaguing his family -- rising prices.
"Everything has gone up," Mr. Singh said on a recent afternoon, as his family members plucked a meager cotton harvest on their one-acre patch of earth in the Indian state of Gujarat. He rattled off the items that cost more: the lentils that are a staple of his family's diet; the cotton-oil cakes they feed to their dairy cows. Fertilizer. Diesel fuel for their tractor. Clothing, and school fees for the four children.
Across this nation of more than 1.3 billion people, as in many of the world's developing countries, versions of such tribulations are diminishing fortunes.
The strain of higher prices reflects a global change in sentiment as the United States Federal Reserve -- known, not for nothing, as the central bank for the world -- steadily lifts interest rates, as it did on Wednesday. Investors have been pulling money out of riskier, developing countries and entrusting it to safer, more established economies like the United States. That has sent the value of currencies plunging from Argentina to Turkey to India, making basic goods more expensive for households and businesses, while amplifying debts.
"Farmers are losing money," Mr. Singh said. "We just survive. We are earning less and spending more."
As money abandons emerging markets, commercial activity is slowing, magnifying concerns about a broader deceleration of growth in the global economy. Such worries have been adding to troubles in stock markets around the world, including the United States, with investors absorbing the likelihood of leaner times.
The change in the flow of money has been engineered in part by people in Washington, some 8,000 miles away from Mr. Singh's farm in western India. The American central bank has been raising interest rates, ending the era of ultracheap money unleashed a decade ago as the world plunged into the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.
Back when rates were effectively zero, investors scoured the globe for higher returns, placing big bets on high-risk, high-reward countries -- India among them -- propping up the value of currencies. With the Federal Reserve now reversing course, money has been washing back to the United States, bolstering the American dollar, while depressing many emerging market currencies.
Last year, global investors delivered $315 billion in fresh capital to the stock and bond markets of emerging economies, not counting China, according to an analysis by Oxford Economics in London. This year, the flow dropped to $105 billion through October. Many economies have seen outright reversals, with Turkey, Argentina, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and South Africa all seeing overall declines.
"You have the perfect cocktail of risks for emerging markets," said Nafez Zouk, Oxford's lead emerging markets economist.
This turnaround has exposed many countries to a painful reckoning, contributing to full-blown crises in Turkey and Argentina. There, precipitous plunges in currencies have left companies that borrowed in dollars staring at impossible debts. Argentina was forced to accept a $50 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund.
India is in no imminent danger. Official data shows the economy expanding at well over a 7 percent annual clip, though the pace is slowing. The official inflation rate, below 4 percent, is not flashing emergency.
But beneath these headline figures are significant troubles that are prompting money to leave India, applying pressure to families and businesses. Given that India imports more goods than it exports, the effects are potent. Any increase in cost, any factor discouraging companies from hiring, strains a country in which one in five people survive on no more than $1.90 per day, according to the World Bank.
"India is a country that is very vulnerable to the fallout to the readjustment of global interest rates," said Joseph E. Stiglitz, a Nobel laureate economist at Columbia University, and a former chief economist at the World Bank.
India imports more than 80 percent of its oil. Though the price of Brent crude oil -- the global benchmark -- has plummeted over the last two months, it has more than doubled since early 2016. Oil is priced in dollars. Its increase, combined with a 10 percent decline in the value of the rupee this year, have lifted the cost of petroleum-based products, from fuel to chemicals, used by key parts of Indian industry.
Concerns are mounting about rising debt levels as the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi unleashes spending aimed at winning popular support ahead of next year's elections. Worries fester over bad loans choking a banking system still dominated by the government.
Doubts about India's economic vigor have been enhanced as Mr. Modi's government has sniped with the Reserve Bank of India, suggesting it should hand over some of its cash to finance public spending. The drama has resonated as an attack on the central bank's independence, an impression only enhanced this month by the sudden resignation of the bank's governor, Urjit Patel.
All of this has combined to prompt investors to yank their money out of India, pushing the rupee down.
In Gujarat, Mr. Modi's home state, and a center of business, many local industries require imports to make their wares -- especially petroleum products. Gujarat's largest city, Ahmedabad, a dusty, traffic-choked metropolis of six million people, is home to factories that produce plastics, from packaging materials to the film covering greenhouses.
Many of the necessary petroleum products have risen in price by as much as 35 percent. At the same time, a glut of plastics factories worldwide has prevented producers from raising prices, hurting profit margins.
"We are very much affected," said Jigish Doshi, president of the Plastindia Foundation, an alliance of plastic industry trade groups that collectively represent more than 50,000 plastics companies across India.
Mr. Doshi's own company, the Vishakha Group, makes plastic pipes used for irrigation. The fall in the rupee has lifted the cost of the raw materials by 15 percent over the last year. "We are slowing our production," he said.
Gujarat is also a major source of dyes used for coloring textiles and plastic household goods. The fall in the rupee has supplied Indian exporters a competitive advantage, reducing the price of their wares in dollar terms.
So has the Trump administration's tariffs on Chinese goods. Indian companies are gaining orders from American manufacturers seeking alternatives to Chinese suppliers, said Bipin Patel, a director at Jay Chemical Industries Ltd., which operates four dye-making factories in Ahmedabad and exports to some 75 countries.
But the raw materials used to make dyes have risen in price, cutting Jay Chemical's profit margin in half. That trend may still be unfolding.
"The rupee is unsustainable," said Sebastian Morris, an economist at the Indian Institute of Management in Ahmedabad. "It can fall quite a bit more."
At a Mercedes dealership in the center of Ahmedabad, where the most expensive model, the Maybach S 650 sedan, sells for 35 million rupees (more than $486,000), sales staff fret that the weaker rupee has inflated the costs of the vehicles. The top models are imported from factories in Germany.
Two blocks away, on a patch of garbage-strewn dirt within view of the dealership's spinning Mercedes logo, some 600 people live without electricity in shacks fashioned with boards, plastic tarps and sheets of corrugated aluminum. Women scrub pots using water delivered once a day by a municipal tanker. Children pound sticks in the dirt for lack of toys.
Most of the families are migrants from villages who survive as so-called ragpickers, earning less than $3 a day as they scour city streets for discarded materials they can sell -- plastic bottles, scraps of paper, pieces of metal.
Laxman Gohel, a 38-year-old father of two, saved enough from ragpicking to open a tea shop. He boils water over a charcoal fire, making sales of about 1,500 rupees a day (about $21). But the price of charcoal has more than doubled over the last year, leaving him with perhaps 300 rupees in daily profit. He cannot pass on the costs.
"These poor people cannot pay me more," he said.
Across an alleyway, Shahbaz Ansari, 17, works part time repairing truck tires at his father's roadside stall. He is in his final year of high school. After graduation, he imagines a job inside an air-conditioned office.
Mr. Gohel scoffed. "Do you have money to pay a bribe to get a job?" he said. "Nobody gets a job after 12th grade."
Even the children of middle-class homes worry about declining opportunities.
As they sipped fresh juice procured from a sidewalk stand, four students enrolled in a three-year college program in business administration expressed fears that the program may not deliver them to their desired management jobs.
"The rupee is falling day by day," said Vatsal Thakkar, 18. "Wages are falling, so I'm thinking about going to Canada."
Thirty miles northwest of Ahmedabad in the town of Kadi, the Singh family's fortunes are firmly tethered to their land.
Last year, torrential rains destroyed their cotton cop. This year, an insect infestation has cut it by half.
On a recent afternoon, Mr. Singh's wife, Sonal Ben, stood in the 95-degree heat, pulling puffs of cotton from the plants that have flowered, and depositing them into plastic bags. Mr. Singh will use his tractor to haul the crop to a trader in town.
The diesel that fuels his vehicle has increased in price by one-fifth. Yet when he brings his crop to market, he cannot recoup the additional costs.
"The traders decide on the price," he said. "I don't decide."
The traders themselves insist they are themselves at the mercy of global forces, accepting whatever price is dictated by commodity pits from New York to SÃ£o Paulo.
"Now, we are losing money," said Prahlad Bhai Patel, owner of a cotton mill in Kadi.
Ordinarily, Mr. Patel's company sells half the product to domestic factories that spin cotton, and exports the other half to China, Bangladesh, Vietnam and Pakistan.
Lately, he just piles up bales at a loading dock, waiting for better days. The price for his exports is now too low to cover his costs, he said.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday and signaled that it expects additional rate increases next year in a display of measured confidence in the economy that came despite financial market worries and political pressure to suspend rate increases.
Jerome H. Powell, the Fed's chairman, emphasized the continued strength of economic growth at a news conference after the announcement. He acknowledged new strains in recent months, including weaker growth in Europe and China and a downturn in stock prices, and he said the Fed expects slightly slower domestic growth and fewer rate increases next year.
But he strongly defended the Fed's decision to increase rates.
"We think this move was appropriate for what is a very healthy economy," Mr. Powell said.
Mr. Powell's remarks were described by one analyst as a dose of "tough love" for financial markets.
Mr. Powell insisted on the wisdom of the Fed's plans to raise borrowing costs while investors dumped their holdings. Stock prices fell when the Fed released its policy statement at 2 p.m., and dropped again as Mr. Powell spoke. The S&P 500 was down 1.5 percent on the day and is now down 6 percent on the year.
[Here's what a rate increase means for your wallet.]
The Fed's decision also rebuffed President Trump, who has broken with the practice of his predecessors by loudly and publicly campaigning for the Fed to keep rates low to continue stimulating the economy. "Feel the market, don't just go by meaningless numbers," Mr. Trump urged in a tweet earlier on Tuesday.
Asked about Mr. Trump's advice, Mr. Powell said it "played no role" in the Fed's decision.
"Nothing will deter us from doing exactly what we think is the right thing to do," he said.
The decision to raise rates for the fifth consecutive quarter, by a unanimous vote of the Federal Open Market Committee, amounted to a rejection of the view that the Fed should continue to stimulate the economy in the hope of increasing employment and wage gains. The benchmark rate will now sit in a range from 2.25 percent to 2.5 percent, abutting the lower end of what Fed officials consider the neutral zone: the region in which rates would neither stimulate nor restrain the economy.
"Policy at this point does not need to be accommodative," Mr. Powell said of that milestone.
The Fed's announcement offered a few crumbs for critics. In previous statements, the Fed had said it planned "further gradual increases" in its benchmark rate, conveying to investors that additional increases were expected. Wednesday's statement sought to recalibrate those expectations by adding the word "some" to the beginning of the phrase, suggesting that rates may not rise much higher.
A majority of Fed officials predicted on Wednesday that the central bank would raise rates no more than twice next year. In September, most Fed officials had predicted at least three rate increases.
Mr. Powell tried to emphasize that the Fed would continue to keep a close eye on economic conditions and said that the ultimate pace of rate increases was "not predetermined." He has said the Fed's goal is to strike a balance between extending the expansion and maintaining control of inflation.
But the overall tone of the statement suggested the Fed continues to regard the strength of economic growth as more impressive than any storm clouds on the horizon, including a trade war with China and geopolitical strains overseas. Companies continue to add jobs, the unemployment rate sits at 3.7 percent and wages are rising more quickly.
"Over the past year, the economy has been growing at a strong pace, the unemployment rate has been near record lows and inflation has been low and stable," Mr. Powell said. "All of those things remain true today."
Still, Mr. Powell noted that the robust expansion of 2018 would most likely moderate next year, and critics continued to raise questions about the Fed's steady march toward higher rates. It now appears likely that inflation will fall short of the Fed's 2 percent annual target for the seventh consecutive year. And Fed officials predicted on Wednesday that the central bank will miss the 2 percent target next year, too.
Low inflation is a sign of economic weakness and can be a problem in its own right, for instance by restricting the Fed's ability to reduce borrowing costs should the economy begin to falter.
"I think they will look back on this as a mistake," Josh Bivens, the director of research at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, said of the rate increase. "This threatens to snuff out the very beginning of wage gains that we've started to see recently in the data. The Fed should allow the expansion's gains to reach more broadly into the work force and get off the steady escalator of ever-higher interest rates."
Investors and some economists are increasingly concerned about the economic outlook, particularly as the sugar high from Mr. Trump's $1.5 trillion tax cut and spending increases wears off and as the president continues to press trade fights with most of the nation's major trading partners.
On Wednesday, a group of United States financial regulators -- which includes the Fed -- warned that the trade fight with China had the potential to "materially impact U.S. economic growth."
FedEx, a bellwether for the global economy, on Wednesday sharply reduced its profit outlook for 2019 and announced plans to cut jobs, citing a deterioration in demand for its shipping services.
Fred Smith, the company's chief executive, blamed the Trump administration's trade policies.
"Most of the issues that we're dealing with today are induced by bad political choices," Mr. Smith said, specifically citing Mr. Trump's decisions to impose tariffs on a wide range of foreign goods.
There are also signs that the Fed's march toward higher rates is weighing on sales of homes and autos.
"The era of low auto loan rates is clearly behind us," said Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive, which gathers data on the auto industry. Mr. Smoke said the average monthly payment on a new car in November was $567, a 5 percent increase over November 2017. "If rates are indeed even higher in 2019, the buyer pool for new vehicles could further decline," he said.
Mortgage rates, less directly tied to Fed policy, have also climbed, contributing to a recent softening in the sales of new and existing homes. The average interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 4.63 percent last week, up from 3.93 percent a year ago, according to Freddie Mac.
Mr. Powell said these developments "may signal some softening relative to what we were expecting a few months ago." He added that he was aware of the increasingly dour mood among business executives. A survey of corporate chief financial officers published by Duke University last week found that almost half expected the economy to enter a recession next year.
"There's a mood of concern, a mood of angst about growth going forward," Mr. Powell said.
But he said the impact on the economy so far appeared to be small.
"In our view, these developments have not fundamentally altered the outlook," Mr. Powell said.
He added that the United States economy "has continued to perform well" and that -- while overall financial conditions have tightened -- the Fed has only "modestly" lowered its projections as a result.
The bottom line, he said, is that the Fed intends to let circumstances dictate its decisions.
If the economy weakens, the Fed will raise rates more slowly, or stand still. If the economy continues to chug along, the Fed is likely to raise rates at least a few more times.
The Fed's forecasts are guesses, not promises. "There's a fairly high degree of uncertainty about both the path and the ultimate destination of any further increases," Mr. Powell said.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The challenge confronting the Federal Reserve as it meets this week is a tale of two economies. Wall Street investors are behaving as if the economic expansion is in grave danger, while the best available data show that the American economy has continued to grow at a healthy pace.
The disconnect is visible on other Wall Streets across the United States.
Dorice Soroka, who runs a small company at Wall Street and Myrtle Lane in Daytona Beach, Fla., said her revenue has finally reached the level she last saw in 2006. "And that was unhealthy growth," Ms. Soroka said of the years before the crisis. "This is much more healthy."
Peoples State Bank, on East Wall Street in Eagle River, Wis., also is prospering.
"Our market areas remain economically healthy," said Scott M. Cattanach, the president of PSB Holdings, which operates nine branches in central and northern Wisconsin. The bank recently reported that profits rose 28 percent in the third quarter, and demand for development loans remained strong in the fourth quarter.
Katy Brooks, the president of the Bend, Ore., Chamber of Commerce -- whose offices sit on Wall Street -- said the region's tech companies were trying to fill more than 400 vacancies.
The Fed on Wednesday is widely expected to recognize the continued strength of the economy by announcing a quarter-point increase in its benchmark interest rate after a two-day meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee. But the central bank also is expected to tip its hat to queasy investors by emphasizing that future rate increases will depend on continued economic growth.
That would amount to an acknowledgment that 2018 has been a very good year on Wall Streets across the United States -- but that there is growing reason to worry about the coming year.
"While the domestic economy remains healthy, the external backdrop has worsened," said Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays, referring to a recent weakening of international economic growth, particularly in Europe and China. Mr. Gapen said financial conditions in the United States had also tightened sufficiently for the Fed to worry about the broader economic effect.
Equity markets jitterbugged on Tuesday, rising and falling and rising again. The S&P 500 stock index closed the day up 0.01 percent. Oil prices continued to fall, and President Trump renewed his Twitter attacks on the Fed, urging it "feel the market" and not make "yet another mistake."
The expected rate increase, which would lift the benchmark rate into a range between 2.25 and 2.5 percent, would mark the fifth consecutive quarter that the Fed has moved to raise borrowing costs. The benchmark rate now sits close to the bottom of what most Fed officials regard as a neutral zone in which the Fed would neither be encouraging nor discouraging economic activity.
The Fed also will publish a set of economic projections by the members of the committee, which comprises the Fed's board of governors and the presidents of the 12 regional reserve banks. In the last round of forecasts, published in September, most Fed officials predicted the central bank would raise rates three times in 2019. Shaving those predictions would underscore the Fed's doubts about the economy's trajectory.
There is still a lot of good news. The economy has been expanding for almost a decade, the unemployment rate of 3.7 percent is the lowest in a half-century, job growth remains strong and wages are beginning to rise faster.
Consumer spending, the primary form of economic activity in the United States, has been growing at a healthy pace, up 0.6 percent in October. "What we know about Main Street is they're spending like banshees on Christmas stuff, and that's because we've seen a real increase in wages at the low end of the spectrum," said Diane Swonk, the chief economist at Grant Thornton.
But the good news is not great news, at least by historical standards. Some economists see evidence that there is still considerable slack in the labor market, and it appears increasingly likely that inflation will fall short of the Fed's 2 percent target for the seventh straight year.
Ms. Swonk, who expects the Fed to raise rates on Wednesday, said the central bank was trying to strike a delicate balance by wrapping up its post-crisis campaign to stimulate the economy by holding down interest rates to encourage consumer and business borrowing.
"There is good news, and that's what the Fed is acknowledging by raising rates," she said."They don't think that's going to crush the economy."
The fragility of the economy is visible in the anxiety of investors. Between 2004 and 2006, the Fed raised rates at 17 consecutive policy meetings -- from 1 to 5.25 percent -- without noticeably dampening the euphoria on Wall Street. In recent years, markets have treated each quarter-point increase in the Fed's benchmark rate as a significant threat to growth.
But the fragility is also visible far from New York's financial district.
Ms. Soroka, in Daytona Beach, runs a company that gathers information on development projects, allowing contractors and workers to identify potential opportunities.
The company, Builders Exchange and Reprographics, employed eight people before the crisis. Ms. Soroka cut half of those jobs during the crisis, and she has not hired anyone as revenue has recovered. In part, she said, technology has reduced her need for workers. Local governments increasingly post the information she needs on websites, eliminating the need for people to collect documents in person.
But Ms. Soroka said she also remained nervous about investing in her company. Even in the 10th year of an economic expansion -- one of the longest periods of growth in American history -- she said she was reluctant to spend on office decorations, or buy new equipment.
"I tiptoe into things," she said, "because I don't know how sustainable this is going to be."
The Fed's interest rate increases have added a new reason for anxiety. Higher borrowing costs appear to be pinching housing, as sales of new and existing homes have softened in recent months. The government reported Tuesday that housing starts increased in November, but the change was driven by a rise in multifamily construction, which tends to vary month to month.
Ms. Soroka said that developers in the Central Florida region that she watches closely are showing signs of increased caution. For example, she said, developers appear to be breaking projects into a larger number of phases, so the initial increment of construction is smaller. A developer might obtain permits for a 500-lot subdivision, she said, but begin with a section of 50 homes.
"I know a lot of business owners who are thinking about being a little more liquid, which means that money is not going into the economy," she said. "They're just holding it."

Full text: A record 45.7 million passengers are expected to fly on domestic airlines from Dec. 20 to Jan. 6. But unlike holiday seasons past, they are unlikely to be standing in nightmarishly long lines.
"My hope is this Christmas will be a better, less stressful, more hassle-free airport screening experience than last year," said Henry Harteveldt, founder of Atmosphere Research Group, a travel industry analysis firm in San Francisco.
Why? Better technology is one reason. The Transportation Security Administration has installed more effective equipment, like improved conveyor belts and 3-D scanning machines, which give screeners a better view of the contents of travelers' carry-on bags. The airlines and airports are testing biometric screening of passengers' passports or other photo IDs.
The airlines are also adding more flights on some of their busiest routes or switching to bigger planes to meet demand during the period.
And then, there are the dogs.
The T.S.A. is using more dogs trained to detect explosives. The dogs speed the security process because passengers have already been vetted for explosives by the time they reach the scanners. "They're a very important layer of security," an agency spokeswoman, Lisa Farbstein, said.
Of course, bad weather could throw a wrench into all the plans. But airlines also have an answer for that -- apps that they say will allow travelers to reschedule their flights more quickly than standing in line at the ticket counter.
The result should be smoother travel.
"The industry is not ignoring the challenge of this," Mr. Harteveldt said. "What I'm encouraged by is that steps are being taken, these new initiatives are being implemented and anything that can help move people through the screening faster is going to benefit everybody."
Multiple factors are responsible for the surge in passenger traffic, a 5.2 percent rise over the comparable period last season, industry analysts say. A robust economy with low unemployment and rising wages has given Americans more money and more confidence about spending that money.
"We're basically experiencing the impact of a strong economy," said Dan McKone, senior partner and head of the travel and transportation practice at L.E.K. Consulting. "While there's a lot of mixed indicators impacting the markets, the overall economy remains strong and air passenger growth tends to be most highly correlated with G.D.P.," he said.
While investors' concern about economic growth has led to volatility in the stock market in recent weeks, it has also contributed to the slide in global oil prices that has translated to lower gas prices for drivers and cheaper jet fuel.
"Jet fuel has decreased, although it was up as much as 30 to 40 percent earlier this year," Mr. Harteveldt said.
This is helping to keep ticket prices low, which also drives demand, especially among leisure travelers. According to data from the travel booking platform Hopper, round-trip domestic ticket prices for holiday flights are averaging $304, a drop of nearly 10 percent from last year. (Prices for international flights ticked up a bit, rising $66 on average.)
"If you actually look at the average price of tickets in real terms adjusted for inflation, air traffic continues to be more and more affordable," Mr. McKone said.
With ticket prices lower, more Americans will be flying, and Hopper estimates that overall spending will be 6 percent higher this holiday season than last. "Having lower prices definitely does drive demand," Mr. McKone said.
Airlines for America, the industry trade organization, estimates that domestic airlines will add, collectively, 143,000 seats daily to accommodate holiday travelers, and according to Patrick Surry, chief data scientist at Hopper, much of that capacity is being added by the major carriers at large hub airports.
Southwest Airlines, for instance, announced new routes last month in Northern California and the Washington, D.C., area, as well as to popular warm-weather vacation destinations. United Airlines, which expects to transport roughly half a million passengers -- a 4 percent increase over 2017 -- on its peak holiday travel days, is increasing the frequency of flights to locations like the Caribbean and ski resort areas, and plans to add nearly 20 domestic wide-body aircraft to help manage full flights over the holidays, an airline spokesman, Charlie Hobart, said.
The airline industry is looking to technology to help prevent bottlenecks and move travelers from check-in to gate to boarding more quickly -- not just for this holiday season, but into 2019 and beyond.
Last month, JetBlue installed its first biometric self-boarding gate at its Kennedy International Airport headquarters in New York. Instead of having passengers' IDs checked by gate agents, a camera takes a picture. The photo is sent to a United States Customs and Border Protection server to compare with that person's passport photo on file.
"They built the algorithm to compare those photos," said Caryl Spoden, JetBlue's head of customer experience. "Everything happens in two to three seconds," she said, adding that the photo taken at the gate is not saved or stored.
"It does remove the manual passport verification. That is a good time saver," she said. "It allows our crew members to interact with the customer in a more meaningful way."
Ms. Spoden said the inaugural machine will process around 500 passengers a day over the holidays. "Our intent is to expand this to every gate at J.F.K. and beyond," she said.
Delta Air Lines has been testing facial recognition boarding for the past two years, and this fall introduced its first biometric terminal at its Atlanta headquarters for travelers taking direct international flights on Delta or its code-share partners Aeromexico, Air France-KLM and Virgin Atlantic. Delta says the technology shaves nine minutes off boarding time per flight. American Airlines also started a biometric boarding program this month at Los Angeles International Airport, which will be tested and evaluated for a 90-day period.
In the interim, though, there are the dog noses.
The T.S.A. currently has roughly 1,000 dogs trained to detect explosives, and it trains about 350 new dogs a year. It also works with teams of K-9 handlers employed by state and local law enforcement agencies. Last month the agency announced an initiative to allow private companies that train and handle explosives-detecting dogs to provide security for cargo air traffic, freeing up more of the T.S.A.'s dogs to screen travelers.
Even though these early inroads into biometric and 3-D scanning technology will help speed the journeys of a relatively tiny subset of the nearly 46 million people expected to fly during the holidays, industry analysts say they will help airlines cope with the long-term growth in passenger traffic. "You're still seeing this trend where the price of flying is increasing at a lower rate than general income, so you have, every year, a huge number of people around the world who take their first plane trip," Mr. Surry, of Hopper, said.

Full text: LOS ANGELES -- The ecstatically reviewed "Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse" stuck its landing, likely starting a new animated franchise for Sony Pictures. And Clint Eastwood, playing a cranky drug courier in "The Mule," proved that he is still an incredibly bankable star, even at nearly 90 years old.
But it was a calamitous weekend at the North American box office for Peter Jackson, whose name did little for "Mortal Engines," which arrived as one of the biggest flops of the year.
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," heralded for its inventive animation and clever use of multiple Spideys, was the No. 1 movie in the United States and Canada. It collected about $35.4 million at 3,813 theaters, according to Comscore, which compiles box-office data. Sony spent roughly $90 million to make the movie, not including substantial marketing costs. The PG-rated film was produced by a team that included Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, the duo behind "The Lego Movie."
[Read A. O. Scott's review: A fresh take on "Spider-Man"]
Ticket buyers agreed with critics, giving "Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse" an A-plus grade in CinemaScore exit polls.
"The Mule" (Warner Bros.), which Mr. Eastwood also directed, took in an estimated $17.2 million, one of the best initial results for an original drama this year. That total, enough for second place, gave Mr. Eastwood his biggest opening as a star since 2000, when "Space Cowboys" arrived to $18.1 million, or roughly $27 million after adjusting for inflation.
"The Mule," which cost $50 million to make, is expected to do well over the busy holiday period, in part because it will have little direct competition; studios are mostly planning to serve up fantasies heavy on computer-generated imagery.
Speaking of which: "Mortal Engines" (Universal), a futuristic fantasy involving giant, predator cities that roll on wheels, collected an estimated $7.5 million -- a terrible result for a film that cost Media Rights Capital and Universal at least $100 million to make, not including marketing.
"Mortal Engines" was directed by Christian Rivers from a script by Mr. Jackson, Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens, the Oscar-winning trio behind the "Lord of the Rings" and "Hobbit" movies. Universal used the screenwriters' connection with fantasy fans in its marketing campaign. Mr. Rivers, a first-time feature filmmaker, also worked on those blockbusters; he is one of Mr. Jackson's longtime storyboard and visual effects artists.
"Mortal Engines," which received poor reviews, has taken in an additional $35 million in release overseas.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Hi there! Here you are, rushing around with too many plans, not enough holiday shopping done and perhaps a mild headache from last night's mulled wine. The least we can give you is a quick rundown of what's going on in the business world. If you like what you're reading and haven't already subscribed, click here -- and then forward to a friend if you're feeling generous.
Speaking of the holiday season, are you one of the 45.7 million Americans planning to fly in the next two weeks? If so, keep an ear out: Customs officials at Kennedy Airport have intercepted almost 200 live finches (70 last week alone) that were smuggled on flights from Guyana. Once in the United States, the birds compete in chirping competitions, and a winner can fetch up to $10,000. While we do not condone any illegal behavior, in the grand scheme of sounds to be heard on a plane, a finch sounds downright pleasant.

DEC. 9-15
What's Up?
A Bigger Apple in Your Backyard
Want a shot at an Apple employee discount? Now may be your moment. Apple announced plans on Thursday to invest $1 billion in a slick new campus in Austin, Tex. It will eventually bring 15,000 jobs to the area, while additional offices in Seattle, San Diego and Culver City, Calif., each plan to hire more than 1,000 employees. For years, Apple has been under fire for relying heavily on China for its product manufacturing, and this announcement makes good on its recent promise to expand operations in the United States. Other tech giants like Amazon and Google have made similar moves to expand their domestic work force in the past few months.
No Brexit Deal in Sight
Consider popping over to England for some holiday shopping -- you'll get a good deal on your dollar, as the British pound fell last week to its lowest value in a year and half. That's only one symptom of the instability brought on by Britain's floundering attempts to extricate itself from the European Union. On Tuesday, Prime Minister Theresa May -- whose name is almost impossible to say without the word "embattled" before it -- postponed the parliamentary vote on her Brexit proposal, which was clearly headed for defeat. Now, having survived a no-confidence vote, she's back to the drawing board with exasperated European leaders, who have expressed little to no interest in renegotiating.
China's Growth Falters
Trade tensions with China eased slightly as President Xi Jinping began to lift new barriers to American imports like cars and food (phew). But the dispute is far from over, and China's economy is showing signs of stress, weakened by mounting debt and the Trump administration's tariffs. On Friday, Chinese officials reported bleak numbers for monthly sales and industrial production, jolting markets around the globe. Auto sales have also plunged, and some factories are sending workers off for the Lunar New Year holiday two months early.
DEC. 16-22
What's Next?
The Rate Question
Don't be surprised by a tremor in the markets this Wednesday -- it's just the Federal Reserve making its last interest rate decision of the year. The Fed is expected to raise benchmark rates by another quarter point, and to do so twice more in 2019. Officials hope to stem inflation and keep the economy solid as it grows over the long run, but these upticks affect home buyers and other borrowers most acutely in the short term: Higher interest rates on mortgages and other loans can add up, and quickly. President Trump has made no secret of his distaste for rate increases of any amount, and blamed this fall's market volatility on the Fed's choice to impose them.
Build the Wall or Bust?
So much for Washington going quietly into the holiday break. Funding for parts of the federal government will expire this Friday unless Congress and Mr. Trump can agree on legislation to keep the lights on. In an awkward televised spat with the Democratic congressional leaders, Representative Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer, the president said he would be "proud to shut down the government" if the funding bill did not include $5 billion for his proposed southern border wall -- which he has repeatedly said that Mexico would pay for, but never mind. Democrats have agreed to dedicate funds to border security, but not enough for the wall.
The Ghost of Ghosn
While Nissan's former chairman, Carl Ghosn, sits in jail, awaiting trial on charges of financial misconduct, the future of his auto empire (the alliance of Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors) is in limbo. Nissan's stock has dropped 9 percent in recent weeks, and its board members are meeting on Monday to attempt to appoint a new chairman. It's unlikely that they will agree on one. They'll also set a date for a shareholder vote to oust Mr. Ghosn from the board altogether. Rather awkwardly, Renault has stuck by Mr. Ghosn, and he remains chief executive. So much for an alliance.
______
What Else?
Federal prosecutors are examining the finances of Mr. Trump's 2017 inauguration committee and a pro-Trump super PAC to determine whether foreigners illegally funneled money to both in hopes of buying influence over American policy. Also, the tabloid publisher American Media Inc. admitted to participating in a hush-money scheme intended to protect Mr. Trump during his 2016 presidential campaign. Speaking of settlements, CBS paid the actress Eliza Dushku $9.5 million after she spoke up about sexual harassment on the set of TV drama "Bull" and was written off the show, adding to the list of sexual misconduct issues at the network.
What Counts
100 euros: An increase to the monthly minimum wage in France, as promised by President Emmanuel Macron this week, in an effort to quell the Yellow Vest protests. France's current monthly minimum wage is 1,498.5 euros, or a little over $1,700.

Full text: For moneyed Americans, most of the past year has felt like 1929 all over again -- the fun, bathtub-gin-quaffing, rich-white-people-doing-the-Charleston early part of 1929, not the grim couple of months after the stock market crashed.
After a decade-long stock market party, which saw the stocks of the S. & P. 500 index create some $17 trillion in new wealth, the rich indulged in $1,210 cocktails at the Four Seasons hotel's Ty Bar in New York, in $325,000 Rolls-Royce Cullinan sport-utility vehicles in S.U.V.-loving Houston and in nine-figure crash pads like Aaron Spelling's 56,000-square-foot mansion in Los Angeles (currently on the market for $175 million, more than double what it fetched just five years ago).
Will it last? Who knows. But in recent months, the anxiety that we could be in for a replay of 1929 -- or 1987, or 2000, or 2008 -- has become palpable not just for the Aspen set, but for any American with a 401(k).
Overall, stocks are down 1.5 percent this year, after hitting dizzying heights in early October. Hedge funds are having their worst year since the 2008 crisis. And household debt recently hit another record high of $13.5 trillion -- up $837 billion from the previous peak, which preceded the Great Recession.
After a decade of low interest rates that fueled a massive run-up in stocks, real estate and other assets, financial Cassandras are not hard to find. Paul Tudor Jones, the billionaire investor, recently posited that we are likely in a "global debt bubble," and Jim Rogers, the influential fund manager and commentator, has forewarned of a crash that will be "the biggest in my lifetime" (he is 76).
What might prove the pinprick to the "everything bubble," as doomers like to call it? Could be anything. Could be nothing. Only time will tell if the everything bubble is a bubble at all. But, just a decade after the last financial crisis, here are five popular doom-and-gloom scenarios.
Happy holidays!
5. Student Debt
Remember how the 2008 crisis was triggered by a bunch of people, who probably should not have been lent giant amounts of money in the first place, not making their mortgage payments? That was just the precipitating factor, but go back and stream "The Big Short" if none of this rings a bell.
Then fast-forward to 2018, where bad mortgages may not be the problem. Consider, instead, the mountain of student debt out there, which is basically a $1.5 trillion bet that a generation of underemployed young people will ever be able pay off a hundred grand in tuition loans in an economy where even hedge funders are getting creamed. Already, a lot of them aren't paying and can't pay. In a climate where "there are massive amounts of unaffordable loans being made to people who can't pay them," as Sheila Bair, the former head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, described the student debt problem in Barron's earlier this year, nearly 20 percent of those loans are already delinquent or in default. That number could balloon to 40 percent by 2023, according to a report earlier this year by the Brookings Institution.
Now, lots of that debt is owed the federal government, so it's unlikely to poison the banking system, as mortgages did a decade ago. But this burden of debt is already beginning to wipe out the next generation of home buyers and auto purchasers. As a result, a generation of well-educated and underemployed millennials, told to value a college education above all, could drag down an economy that never seemed to want them in the first place.
4. China
You know who has racked up even more debt than hopeful 20-something ceramics-studies grads in the United States? Here's a hint: It's a not-exactly-Communist country in Asia that has been on such a wild debt-fueled building spree that it somehow used more cement in just three years earlier this decade than the United States did in the entire 20th century. Think about that. Now think about it some more. Over the past decade, China devoted mountains of cash to build airports, factories and entire would-be cities -- now known as "ghost" cities, since the cities are populated by largely empty skyscrapers and apartment towers -- all in the name of economic growth. And grow it did.
The result is a country with a supersized population (1.4 billion people) and supersized debt. Where things go from here is anyone's guess. Optimists might argue that those trillions bought a 21st-century Asian equivalent of the American dream. Pessimists describe that massive debt as a "mountain," a "horror movie," a "bomb" and a "treadmill to hell," all in the same Bloomberg article. One thing seems certain, though: If the so-called "debt bomb" in China explodes, it's likely to sprinkle the global economy with ash. And with President Trump teasing a trade war that already seems to be threatening China's massive, export-based economy, we may have our answer soon.
3. The End of Easy Money
Say you lived in the suburbs, and one day your neighbor suddenly pulled up her driveway in a new $75,000 Cadillac Escalade. A week later, she was tugging a new speedboat. A few weeks after that, it was Jet Skis. You might either think, "Wow, she's rolling in it," or "Golly, she hates glaciers." (Hatred of glaciers may prove, actually, to be the real spark of the financial end times.) But what if it turned out that she bought all of those carbon-dioxide-spewing toys on credit, at crazy-low interest rates? And what if those rates suddenly started to spike? The result would likely be good news for the polar ice caps and bad news for her, when the repo man (not to cave to gender stereotypes about repo-persons) came calling.
O.K., overstretched metaphor alert: The "neighbor" is us. Ever since the Federal Reserve started printing money in the name of "quantitative easing" to pull us out of the last financial crisis, money has been cheap, and seemingly any American with a pulse and a credit line has been able to fake "rich" by bingeing on all sorts of indulgences -- real estate (despite tighter lending standards), fancy watches and awesome gaming systems, to say nothing of the debt that corporations were racking up, which some market analysts think might be the biggest threat of all.
The problem is: The whole system is now running in reverse. The Fed has been hiking rates and spooking markets in order to stave off inflation and other potential ills. Is this an overdue fit of fiscal sanity, or the equivalent of taking away the punch bowl just as the party was getting started, then dumping it on our heads?
There is at least one person at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue who thinks this could all end badly. "The United States should not be penalized because we are doing so well," Mr. Trump tweeted on July 20, just one of a series of broadsides against the current Fed policy, adding, "Debt coming due & we are raising rates - Really?"
2. Italexit
I know, it's a crazy thought: Imagine that a bunch of neighboring countries with wildly different languages, customs, values, and priorities somehow failed to get along? We don't have to rewind 70-something years to the last Pan-European shooting war. Just witness the continuing problems in the European Union. Ever since Britain voted to leave the union in the Brexit referendum of 2016, Europeans have been engaged in a dark parlor game, speculating on who might be next. Might it be a "Frexit" spurred by nationalists in France? A "Nexit" stoked by the anti-immigrant far right in the Netherlands? Lately, the fears have focused on Italy, where an "Italexit" -- or "Quitaly," if you can't help yourself -- has been bandied about by populist politicians as they threaten to abandon the euro, or leave the European Union altogether, over an ongoing tiff with European neighbors over deficit spending, migration and whatever else drums up votes.
The turmoil has already sent ripples through global markets during the past year. In recent months, Italian populists are still making veiled threats to break up the coalition, and the official denials are not 100 percent reassuring. Following the latest budget squabble with Brussels, the Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte told news reporters: "Read my lips: For Italy there is no chance, no way to get 'Italexit.' There is no way to get out of Europe, of the eurozone." Was he aware that "read my lips" is American political shorthand for a "broken promise"?

Full text: Stocks? Messy. Bonds? Meh. Commodities? Not pretty.
Most years, financial markets are a mixed bag. A bad year for risky investments, like stocks, might be a great one for safe bets like government bonds. Or, if worries about inflation are hurting bond investments, commodities like gold tend to do well.
Not this year.
For the first time in decades, every major type of investment has fared poorly, as the outlook for economic growth and corporate profits is dampened by rising trade tensions and interest rates. Stocks around the world are getting pummeled, while commodities and bonds are tumbling -- all of which have left investors with few places to put their money.
If this persists, or grows worse, it could create a damaging feedback loop, with doubts about the economy hurting the markets, and trouble in the markets undermining growth.
Pessimism emanating from the stock market could leave consumers and businesses scared to spend. The rout in junk bonds makes it more expensive for financially fragile businesses to borrow. The collapse in crude oil prices discourages new investment and hiring in the oil patch, which has been a source of job growth.
In that sense, the markets are both a gauge of what investors expect to happen in the economy, and a potential catalyst for their decisions. The mood in the financial markets ultimately feeds into spending by companies and consumers, and if they pull back, based on panicky ups and downs, growth could suffer.
"People look to the financial markets as a source of information, as a signal, about what's going to happen and what's going to come," said Itay Goldstein, finance professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. "And when they see markets going down, they start thinking pessimistically about the outlook for the real economy."
[Read more: Stocks across Wall Street are enduring one of the most prolonged periods of volatility of the past decade.]
There's scant evidence that the worst-case scenario will play out. The American economy remains strong: Unemployment is near 50-year lows, and growth is steady. And it wasn't that long ago that financial markets were feeling good about the global economy, shrugging off troublesome issues like the trade war, Britain's exit from the European Union and the debt levels of developing nations.
On Sept. 20, stock investors in the United States were sitting on a nearly 10 percent gain for the year. Benchmark American crude oil prices were up more than 20 percent. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index was up more than 15 percent.
But those profits are gone.
Since October, an index of commodities that includes oil and copper has swung from gains of 20 percent to losses for the year. A similar move took place in risky corporate bonds. So far this year, after another steep drop on Friday, the S&P 500-stock index is down about 2.8 percent.
[Read more: The stock market has wiped out its 2018 gains. There have been several moments like this in the last decade.]
"In a typical year there's going to be some winners and losers," said Ed Clissold, chief United States strategist at the equity market research firm Ned Davis Research. "It's very rare that you get nothing working."
His firm recently looked at eight types of investments going back to 1972. In every year, at least one of these categories generated a return of 5 percent or more. A separate study by JPMorgan Chase analysts found that "2018 has delivered losses on almost every asset class and investing style."
The widespread market jitters have accompanied a tectonic shift in the investing world, as central banks have begun to withdraw the extraordinary support provided to the global economy in response to the financial crisis a decade ago.
For nearly seven years, the Federal Reserve kept interest rates near zero and bought trillions of dollars' worth of government bonds, which pushed interest rates -- that move in the opposite direction of prices -- sharply lower. Money in the bank earned next to nothing, so investors eagerly bought anything they expected to generate some kind of return: risky debt, real estate, stocks, technology start-ups.
The Fed's support, bolstered by similar efforts from the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank, proved to be a huge tailwind for global financial markets. Everything seemingly moved up in tandem.
Now the opposite appears to be unfolding, as the Fed pulls back. The American central bank has raised interest rates eight times since December 2015, and is expected to do so again this coming week. This year alone, it has shrunk its stockpile of bonds by roughly $370 billion. On Thursday, the European Central Bank said it was ending its crisis intervention, called quantitative easing.
"What was once a tailwind is now a headwind for markets," said Dan Ivascyn, group chief investment officer at Pimco, a bond investment firm with $1.7 trillion under management, in Newport Beach, Calif.
At least on the margins, the turmoil in the financial markets is already reverberating in the real economy.
For instance, as Treasury bond prices have declined this year, interest rates -- which move in the opposite direction -- have risen.
Those Treasury yields serve as the basis for a range of consumer borrowing rates, such as on mortgages. With the 30-year fixed mortgage rate rising above 5 percent this year, activity in the housing market has slumped, sending the stock prices of homebuilders sharply lower. The S&P 1500 index of home building stocks is down more than 30 percent this year.
In recent weeks, the broad investment declines have worsened while anxiety grows over the trade war between the United States and China. This fight, between the world's two largest economies, may already be dragging on global growth.
Economic data this month showed that Chinese trade slowed sharply in November, with imports of key metals such as copper and iron ore declining from the same month last year. On Friday, Chinese officials reported weak growth in monthly retail sales and industrial production. The numbers point to a deepening slowdown for the industrial heart of the world's No. 2 economy. Weak demand from China has roiled commodities, which are on track for their worst year since 2015.
The experience of 2015 could be a useful road map for investors. That year was uncomfortable as the Federal Reserve planned to raise interest rates against a backdrop of soft global growth. Stocks, corporate bonds and commodities all fell, while Treasury bonds eked out a minuscule gain.
In the midst of the market turmoil, the Federal Reserve slowed down the pace of its interest rate increases. And the pause from the central bank reinvigorated risk-taking among investors, with the S&P 500 rising 9.5 percent the next year, and the economy continuing to grow.
That's all to say, investors can be quick to jump to conclusions. But they can also be wrong.
"They're like people reading a book," said Jurrien Timmer, director of global macro at the asset manager Fidelity Investments in Boston. "But they're going to skip five chapters to see how the book ends."

Market Swings at Their Highest Level Since 2011
Stocks across Wall Street are enduring one of the most prolonged periods of turbulent trading of the last decade. So far this year, there have been 12 instances of the S&P 500 moving at least 3 percent from its intraday low to its high, according to data from Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst for S&P Dow Jones Indices. Four of those swings were greater than 4 percent.
This figure is the most in a single year since 2011, when the European debt crisis flared up and Standard & Poor's cut its rating on United States government debt.
The pickup in volatility this year has accelerated in recent months, as worries about trade, global growth and interest rates keep investors on edge. More than half of the 3-percent swings have come since the most recent sell-off began in early October. And the average intraday swing this month is the highest level for a month since January 2016.
This year's increase in volatility isn't necessarily unusual. Over the last 56 years, the S&P 500 has averaged nearly 10 intraday swings of 3 percent or more a year. And this year's 99 moves of 1 percent or more are well below the 169 the index has averaged since 1962. STEPHEN GROCER

GM Saves Jobs for Workers to Be Laid Off
General Motors' plans to lay off 14,000 salaried and blue-collar workers might not be as bad as originally projected.
The company said Friday that 2,700 out of the 3,300 American factory jobs slated for elimination will now be saved. Blue-collar workers will still lose jobs at four United States plants slated for closure next year, but most will be able to find employment at other GM factories where jobs are being added. Some would have to move.
GM still plans to lay off about 8,000 white-collar workers and another 2,600 factory workers in Canada.
In November, the company announced plans to end production at the American factories and one in Ontario as part of a major restructuring designed to cut costs and divert resources to development and manufacturing of trucks, SUVs and electric and autonomous vehicles.
While some of the 3,300 American factory workers will retire, most of the rest will be offered one of 2,700 jobs the company plans to add at factories where production will increase, GM announced on Friday. Some would have to move to other cities for jobs. A.P.
ECONOMY
Consumer Spending Rises on Strong Holiday Sales
United States consumer spending gathered momentum in November as households bought furniture, electronics and a range of other goods, which could further allay fears of a significant slowdown in the American economy even as the outlook overseas continued to darken.
The upbeat data from the Commerce Department on Friday bolstered expectations that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates for a fourth time this year at its Dec. 18-19 policy meeting, despite moderating inflation and tighter market conditions.
It also stood in contrast to reports from China showing a huge falloff in retail sales and from Europe where a measure of business activity expanded at its slowest rate in four years. REUTERS

Full text: Bob Bergland, a Minnesota Democrat who as a liberal congressman and President Jimmy Carter's secretary of agriculture was a zealous advocate for America's consumers as well as its farmers, died on Sunday in his hometown, Roseau, Minn. He was 90.
Mr. Bergland's son, Franklyn, said he died at LifeCare Roseau Manor, a nursing home where he had resided recently.
A descendant of 19th century Norwegians who settled in the blizzard country of northern Minnesota, Mr. Bergland experienced poverty, unemployment and, as a young man, was forced to leave his farm and go to Florida to find work. Later, representing a vast, largely rural district in Congress from 1971 to 1977, and then as a member of the Carter cabinet until 1981, he spoke passionately about his hard-pressed constituents.
"I know what it's like to be poor," he told The New York Times in 1978. "I know those times when we lost a crop and couldn't find steady work around Roseau. I couldn't buy milk for my kids then. I'm terribly upset when people who don't know what they're talking about criticize the poor who are struggling and want to work."
In an era when small family farms were being gobbled up by agribusiness, and when soaring inflation was corroding the purchasing power of millions of Americans, Mr. Bergland angered many farmers by tempering his advocacy of farm subsidies and price supports, and offering evenhanded encouragements for inflation-weary consumers.
Are farmers and consumers natural enemies? It might seem a simple matter of logic: When farmers make more money for their products, consumers must pay more to get them. But things are never quite so simple when it comes to farmers and consumers, especially in the tangled politics that link them in the economic scheme of things.
"I regard the consumer as the farmers' customer, not his enemy," Mr. Bergland told The Times, compressing the conflict into a kind of brotherhood of interests. "And neither side is right every time in every argument."
As a practical matter, the secretary of agriculture may provide crop and land-use subsidies to farmers, promote price supports and grant farm loans in lean years. Contrary to popular assumption, however, the secretary is not simply a farmers' advocate, and has no mandate to assure the welfare of individual farmers.
"Compounding the secretary's problem with the farmers is the fact that while all farmers want profits, few of them can agree on what should be done to insure them," Seth S. King wrote in a New York Times Magazine profile of Mr. Bergland in 1978. "Mr. Bergland is like the man trying to stuff an inner tube into a tire casing. If he pushes in one part, another pops out."
Demanding higher price supports and calling unsuccessfully for a nationwide farm strike, hundreds of farmers invaded the nation's capital on tractors, camper vans and pickup trucks in 1979. They broke into the Department of Agriculture building and occupied Mr. Bergland's office, and wandered through the Capitol and confronted Mr. Bergland at a committee hearing.
"There's no quick fix or free lunch in this business," he told them. "It's not the role of the federal government to guarantee all farmers a profit year after year. We have the responsibility to keep agriculture productive and strong, but the nation does not have the responsibility of assuming all the risks of farming."
"Bob Bergland is a farmer and he understands this business," said Earl Hayes, a Kansas farmer and leader of a wheat growers' association. "But he's something of a hired man and he's had to temper his dealing with the budget boys. He's tried to be broad-minded, and this makes him look a little wishy-washy to some farmers."
As secretary of agriculture, Mr. Bergland directed a department of 83,000 employees whose work affected virtually every taxpayer and consumer in America. Its 9,000 inspectors guarded the cleanliness and quality of meats. It lent $30 million a year to farmers, issued crop reports that influenced markets; supervised subsidies, controlled the labeling of packaged foods and directed $9.3 billion in programs that provided food stamps to 15 million people and lunches at 95,000 schools.
Among his signature achievements, Mr. Bergland helped steer the Farm Act of 1977 through Congress. It created a grain reserve that became a primary weapon to flatten boom-and-bust cycles. Under the plan, the government paid farmers to store grain on their own farms, holding it during fat years when prices were low, and marketing it in lean years when supplies were low and prices rose.
Mr. Bergland also created an assistant secretary of agriculture to protect consumer interests, and named Carol Tucker Foreman, executive director of the Consumer Federation of America, to fill it. She was a tough adversary of food processors, meatpackers and, indirectly, of farmers, demanding true-weight labeling on food packages, ordering junk food off school lunches, tightening rules on preservatives and launching studies on carcinogens and dietary effects on health.
"It was my idea and my appointment," Mr. Bergland said. "The Agriculture Department is going to be all the people's department, not just the farmers."
Before leaving office, Mr. Bergland unveiled a study that drew a relatively rosy picture of the nation's agriculture. World demand for American grains had burgeoned, he said, and most of the price-depressing surpluses had been sold. He also said that food production was nearing capacity, and that family farms with annual incomes of about $150,000 were the most efficient.
Robert Selmer Bergland was born in Roseau, near Minnesota's Canadian border, on July 22, 1928, one of four children of Selmer Bennett Bergland, a garage mechanic, and the former Mabel Evans, a teacher. The parents soon bought and began working a 360-acre wheat farm. His father was a Populist who sometimes voted Republican.
Bob, as he was always called, and his siblings, Glen, Betty and Philip, worked long hours in all kinds of weather on the farm. He made light of a climate with "nine months of winter and three months of tough sledding."
After graduating from Roseau High School in 1946, Bob attended the University of Minnesota School of Agriculture on a scholarship. He finished the two-year course in 1948 and joined the Minnesota Farmers Union as a field rep, and became active in the National Farmers Union.
In 1950, he married Helen Grahn. They had seven children: Dianne, Linda, Stevan, Jon, Allan, Bill, and Franklyn.
Besides Franklyn, Mr. Bergland is survived by two other sons, Allan and Bill; two daughters, Dianne Dahl and Linda Vatnsdal; a brother, Glen; 13 grandchildren and numerous great-grandchildren.
The couple borrowed to buy a 280-acre wheat farm. After several bad-weather crop failures, he was unable to find work in the area. He moved his family to Florida and took seasonal jobs as a construction laborer and carpenter. Fired for union organizing, he returned to his farm in Minnesota and became a Farmers Union organizer.
In 1961, Orville L. Freeman, President John F. Kennedy's secretary of agriculture, named Mr. Bergland chairman of the Minnesota Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, an arm of the United States Department of Agriculture. Two years later, he was promoted to Midwest regional director of the service, a position he held for five years.
He lost his first race for Congress on the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party ticket in 1968, but upset a Republican in 1970 and was re-elected three times by increasing margins. He was named to the Cabinet before serving his last term.
In the House, he backed farmer, consumer and environmental causes. There was little surprise when President-elect Carter, a farmer, chose Mr. Bergland as agriculture secretary.
After his Washington years, Mr. Bergland was president of Farmland-Eaton World Trade in 1981-82. He then became executive vice president and general manager of the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association until his retirement in 1993.
In his days as agriculture secretary, when he was scolded by farmers as a consumer advocate, and by consumers as a farm advocate, he kept on his office wall a picture of an unhappy mule, who had tried to jump a fence but got only halfway over. The caption said, "You're damned if you do, and you're damned if you don't."

Full text: A Four-Bedroom Penthouse Outside Monterrey
$4.1 MILLION
This four-bedroom, four-and-a-half-bath penthouse is in San Pedro Garza GarcÃ­a, an upscale suburb of Monterrey, the capital and largest city of the northeastern state of Nuevo LeÃ³n, Mexico. The 4,843-square-foot residence sits atop an undulating, mixed-used building named High Park, designed by the Mexico City-based firm Rojkind Arquitectos and completed in 2015.
The apartment, which occupies the building's 10th floor and roof, was formed by joining two penthouses for greater space and privacy. It includes an exclusive two-level roof deck that has a swimming pool and views of the Sierra Madre Oriental mountain range to the south.
The front door opens into a large living room with two seating and entertaining areas divided by a free-standing wall. Most of the furniture is from Roche Bobois, and the residence is being sold completely furnished, said the seller, Gil Stroming, a dance producer.
One side of the living room has a large, pale sectional and a bar topped with black marble, while the other side has a dark gray sectional, a television and a baby grand piano and drum set. The dark, wide-plank floors and earth-toned walls and furnishings give the interior a modern rustic aesthetic, while the floor-to-ceiling windows bathe it in natural light.
"It's an awesome space for parties," Mr. Stroming said of the penthouse.
There is a half bath near the entrance, as well as a guest bedroom with a large en suite bathroom. From the bar, a door leads to the generous master suite, which has a sitting area and large pull-down shades covering a wall of windows. The master bath, with marble floors, and bedroom share a private terrace.
Opposite the master suite, the dining room connects to an open kitchen with stainless-steel appliances and a granite countertop. Adjacent to the kitchen are an en suite guest bedroom and a small en suite staff bedroom, as well as a hallway with storage and a laundry area. On the other side of the dining room, a cozy lounging corner is accented with white bricks and dark beams, and outfitted with candles, throw pillows and a constellation of hanging ceiling bulbs. A sliding-glass door opens to an expansive terrace, with dining and lounging areas, offering views of Monterrey and the mountains in the distance.
The rooftop terrace includes an infinity pool on a raised deck, two hot tubs, a billiard table, a kitchen and several covered eating spaces. Two sets of stairs -- inside, near the front door, and outside, by the kitchen -- lead up from the penthouse.
The property comes with four below-ground parking spaces. The building has a gym, a billiard and game room, a bar, a sauna, and entertaining and catering spaces.
"It's a very high-end boutique building, so there's a lot of personal care," Mr. Stroming said.
Monterrey, Mexico's third-largest city, is known as the industrial and economic center of the country's northern region, as well as a hub for modern art and culture. The suburb of San Pedro Garza GarcÃ­a, part of the Monterrey metropolitan area, offers a wealth of retail and restaurants, all a short walk from High Park. (The building itself includes two levels of retail spaces.) Barrio Antiguo, Monterrey's historic district, and the city center, with its museums and parks, are about five miles east, while Monterrey International Airport is about 20 miles away.
Market Overview
With a population of about 1.2 million in the city and 4.5 million in the greater metropolitan area, Monterrey is one of Mexico's largest and most active real estate markets, with some of its most expensive properties, agents said.
The state of Nuevo LeÃ³n, which is dominated by the city of Monterrey, saw more than 40,000 home sales between January and August of 2018 -- a huge portion of Mexico's approximately 145,000 sales nationwide during that period -- according to an October market report published by Realty World Mexico, an agency with offices across the country.
Buyers gravitated toward older and more affordable units, and also toward rental properties rather than purchases, in part because of rising inflation, said Jorge Paredes, the chief executive of Realty World Mexico and the report's author.
But Monterrey's luxury properties also performed well. Between January and August of this year, sales of the highest priced properties in Nuevo LeÃ³n increased more than 6 percent over the same period in 2017, Mr. Paredes wrote, while luxury sales dropped almost 8 percent across Mexico.
As the region's economy continues to develop, more executives are buying properties in Monterrey's best neighborhoods and suburbs, agents said. Most prized is San Pedro Garza GarcÃ­a, just outside the city center, where real estate prices are among the highest in Mexico.
Gerardo Gutierrez, chief executive of Gerencia RED, a national real estate agency, said prices of luxury properties there typically range from $1 million to $6 million. Prices in desirable areas of Monterrey have increased sharply in the past two years, he said, from about $2,000 to $3,000 a square meter ($185 to $285 a square foot), because of rising demand.
Maria Fernanda Camacho Bermudez, managing director of Century 21 Camber, an agency in Monterrey, pointed to other high-end neighborhoods, including Las Estancias and La Herradura, within the city, and Las Misiones, a suburb. Luxury properties there go for about $1.24 million to $1.98 million, she said, while the average for the city is around $200,000.
The city's real estate stock has been shifting in recent years, she added, from predominantly "horizontal" designs to more "vertical" developments that include both residential and office towers.
Who Buys in Monterrey
There aren't many foreigners buying homes for vacation or retirement in Monterrey, agents said. And foreigners who move to the city for work usually do so on a contract basis, so they rent.
Ms. Bermudez estimated that only about 10 to 20 percent of her agency's buyers are from outside Mexico, noting that the number includes buyers of commercial, industrial and residential properties.
Mr. Gutierrez said about 15 percent of the luxury home buyers he sees in Monterrey are foreign, most of them from the United States, South Korea and China, usually relocating for work.
Buying Basics
There are restrictions on foreigners buying real estate within 50 kilometers (31 miles) of Mexico's coasts and 100 kilometers (62 miles) of its international borders, unless the property is bought through a trust. Monterrey, about 100 miles from the American border and 200 miles from the Gulf of Mexico, is not subject to those restrictions, but buyers must obtain a permit from the foreign affairs ministry, said Miguel Angel Valdes Faz, a partner with Arizpe, Valdes and Marcos, a Monterrey law firm. The process takes about a month.
Notaries handle real estate transactions, but he recommended hiring a bilingual attorney to ensure the title is clear. There are "small details that have to be looked at by a Mexican attorney, and very often a bilingual attorney will be more helpful with foreign individuals," he said.

Full text: We are, once again, experiencing one of the greatest housing booms in United States history.
How long this will last and where it is heading next are impossible to know now.
But it is time to take notice: My data shows that this is the United States' third biggest housing boom in the modern era.
Since February 2012, when the price declines associated with the last financial crisis ended, prices for existing homes in the United States have been rising steadily and enormously. According to the S&P/CoreLogic/Case-Shiller National Home Price Index (which I helped to create) as of September, the prices were 53 percent higher than they were at the bottom of the market in 2012.
That means, on average, a house that sold for, say, $200,000 in 2012 would bring over $300,000 in September.
Even after factoring in Consumer Price Index inflation, real existing home prices were up almost 40 percent during that period. That is a substantial increase in less than seven years.
In fact, based on my data, it amounts to the third strongest national boom in real terms since the Consumer Price Index began in 1913, behind only the explosive run-up in prices that led to the great financial crisis of a decade ago, and one connected with World War II and the great postwar Baby Boom.
The No. 1 boom occurred from February 1997 to October 2006, when real prices of existing United States homes rose 74 percent. This was a period of intense speculative enthusiasm -- for houses and for financial instruments based on mortgages as investments -- and it was also a time of great regulatory complacency. The term "flipping houses" became popular then. People exploited the boom by buying homes and selling them only months later at a huge profit.
That boom ended disastrously. Soaring valuations collapsed with a 35 percent drop in real prices for existing homes, ushering in the financial crisis that enveloped the world in 2008 and 2009.
The second greatest boom, from 1942 to 1947, had more benign consequences. Over this five-year interval, real prices of existing homes rose 60 percent.
Booms and busts are rooted in popular narratives with complex social-psychological roots. This boom centered on a war-induced housing shortage, an enormous increase in the number of new babies and families who would need housing after the war, and the 1944 G.I. Bill, which subsidized home-buying by veterans. Home prices did not fall significantly after this boom ended.
Today, signs of weakness in the housing market are being taken by some as a signal that the prices of single-family homes may fall soon, as they did sharply after 2006. The leading indicators, which include building permits and sales of both existing and new homes, have all been declining in recent months.
But with few examples of extreme booms, we cannot be sure what such indicators mean for the current market.
Low interest rates -- imposed by the Federal Reserve and other central banks in reaction to the financial crisis -- are the most popular culprit in the current boom. There is some apparent merit to this view, since these three biggest nationwide housing booms all included very low interest rates.
But the market reaction to interest rates is hardly immediate or predictable. The housing market does not react as directly as you might expect to interest rate movements. Over the nearly seven years of the current boom, from February 2012 to the present, all major domestic interest rates have increased, not decreased. So, while interest rates have been low, they have moved the wrong way, yet the boom has continued.
Another explanation is simple economic growth. But, as a matter of history, prices of existing homes -- as opposed to the supply of newly built homes -- have generally not responded to economic growth. There was only a 20 percent increase in real prices of existing homes in the 50 years from 1950 to 2000 despite a sixfold increase in real G.D.P.
The simplest narrative being given for the current boom is just that the 2008-2009 financial crisis and the so-called Great Recession are over and home prices are returning to normal.
But that explanation does not cut it either. In September they were 11 percent higher than at the 2006 peak in nominal terms, and almost as high in real terms. This is not a return to normal, but a market that appears to be rising to a record.
It is difficult to assess the contribution of President Trump to the current boom.
It is certainly less obvious than the role of President George W. Bush in the 1997-2006 boom. Mr. Bush extolled the benefits of "the ownership society" and in 2003 he signed the American Dream Downpayment Act, which subsidized home purchases. In his 2004 re-election bid he boldly asserted: "We want more people owning their own home." This seems to have contributed to an atmosphere of high expectations for home price increases.
The Trump administration's attitude toward housing is less clear. President Trump's slogan "Make America Great Again" has overtones of the "American dream." But provisions of his Tax Reform and Jobs Act of 2017 were unfriendly to homeowners.
Even without major further interest rate increases, there would seem to be a limit on how much the prices of existing homes can increase. After all, people must struggle to cover a range of living expenses, and builders are supplying fresh new offerings to compete with the existing houses on the market.
Perhaps the home price increases are now a self-fulfilling prophesy. As John Maynard Keynes argued in his 1936 "General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money," people seem to have a "simple faith in the conventional basis of valuation."
If the conventional basis is now that home prices are going up 5 percent a year, then sellers, who would otherwise have no idea what to ask for their houses, will just put a price based on this convention. And likewise buyers will not feel they are paying too much if they accept the convention. In the United States, we may believe that the process is all part of the "American dream."
It can't go on forever, of course. But when it will end isn't knowable. The data can't tell us when prices will level off, or whether they will plunge catastrophically. All we do know is that prices have been roaring higher at a speed rarely seen in American history.

Full text: A decade ago, at the end of my first semester teaching at Wharton, a student stopped by for office hours. He sat down and burst into tears. My mind started cycling through a list of events that could make a college junior cry: His girlfriend had dumped him; he had been accused of plagiarism. "I just got my first A-minus," he said, his voice shaking.
Year after year, I watch in dismay as students obsess over getting straight A's. Some sacrifice their health; a few have even tried to sue their school after falling short. All have joined the cult of perfectionism out of a conviction that top marks are a ticket to elite graduate schools and lucrative job offers.
I was one of them. I started college with the goal of graduating with a 4.0. It would be a reflection of my brainpower and willpower, revealing that I had the right stuff to succeed. But I was wrong.
The evidence is clear: Academic excellence is not a strong predictor of career excellence. Across industries, research shows that the correlation between grades and job performance is modest in the first year after college and trivial within a handful of years. For example, at Google, once employees are two or three years out of college, their grades have no bearing on their performance. (Of course, it must be said that if you got D's, you probably didn't end up at Google.)
Academic grades rarely assess qualities like creativity, leadership and teamwork skills, or social, emotional and political intelligence. Yes, straight-A students master cramming information and regurgitating it on exams. But career success is rarely about finding the right solution to a problem -- it's more about finding the right problem to solve.
In a classic 1962 study, a team of psychologists tracked down America's most creative architects and compared them with their technically skilled but less original peers. One of the factors that distinguished the creative architects was a record of spiky grades. "In college our creative architects earned about a B average," Donald MacKinnon wrote. "In work and courses which caught their interest they could turn in an A performance, but in courses that failed to strike their imagination, they were quite willing to do no work at all." They paid attention to their curiosity and prioritized activities that they found intrinsically motivating -- which ultimately served them well in their careers.
Getting straight A's requires conformity. Having an influential career demands originality. In a study of students who graduated at the top of their class, the education researcher Karen Arnold found that although they usually had successful careers, they rarely reached the upper echelons. "Valedictorians aren't likely to be the future's visionaries," Dr. Arnold explained. "They typically settle into the system instead of shaking it up."
This might explain why Steve Jobs finished high school with a 2.65 G.P.A., J.K. Rowling graduated from the University of Exeter with roughly a C average, and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. got only one A in his four years at Morehouse.
If your goal is to graduate without a blemish on your transcript, you end up taking easier classes and staying within your comfort zone. If you're willing to tolerate the occasional B, you can learn to program in Python while struggling to decipher "Finnegans Wake." You gain experience coping with failures and setbacks, which builds resilience.
Straight-A students also miss out socially. More time studying in the library means less time to start lifelong friendships, join new clubs or volunteer. I know from experience. I didn't meet my 4.0 goal; I graduated with a 3.78. (This is the first time I've shared my G.P.A. since applying to graduate school 16 years ago. Really, no one cares.) Looking back, I don't wish my grades had been higher. If I could do it over again, I'd study less. The hours I wasted memorizing the inner workings of the eye would have been better spent trying out improv comedy and having more midnight conversations about the meaning of life.
So universities: Make it easier for students to take some intellectual risks. Graduate schools can be clear that they don't care about the difference between a 3.7 and a 3.9. Colleges could just report letter grades without pluses and minuses, so that any G.P.A. above a 3.7 appears on transcripts as an A. It might also help to stop the madness of grade inflation, which creates an academic arms race that encourages too many students to strive for meaningless perfection. And why not let students wait until the end of the semester to declare a class pass-fail, instead of forcing them to decide in the first month?
Employers: Make it clear you value skills over straight A's. Some recruiters are already on board: In a 2006 study of over 500 job postings, nearly 15 percent of recruiters actively selected against students with high G.P.A.s (perhaps questioning their priorities and life skills), while more than 40 percent put no weight on grades in initial screening.
Straight-A students: Recognize that underachieving in school can prepare you to overachieve in life. So maybe it's time to apply your grit to a new goal -- getting at least one B before you graduate.

Full text: A steep slide followed by a strong recovery whipsawed investors on Thursday, as concerns about the global economy, trade tensions and interest rates kept markets on edge.
Stocks fell around the world after the arrest of a top Chinese technology executive intensified concerns that China and the United States, the world's two largest economies, could be entering a risky new chapter in their trade dispute. But Wall Street recovered most of those losses in an afternoon rally predicated on the prospect that the Federal Reserve may slow down on interest rate increases next year.
At one point in the day, the S&P 500 was down as much as 2.9 percent, mirroring steep declines in Asia and Europe. A recovery late in the trading day, however, left the index down only about 0.2 percent at the closing bell.
The dueling messages continued on Friday morning in Asia, where markets were mixed and futures that predict Wall Street's opening showed a modest drop.
The worldwide drop was set off by news that the chief financial officer of the Chinese telecom giant Huawei, Meng Wanzhou, had been arrested in Canada at the request of the United States. Her detention on Saturday, the same day President Trump and President Xi Jinping of China agreed to a trade truce, could further complicate efforts to resolve a dispute that has weighed on financial markets in recent weeks.
In recent days, skepticism had already grown about prospects for that 90-day truce, as Trump administration aides played down the chances of striking a broad deal and Mr. Trump threatened further tariffs on imports from China, even calling himself a "Tariff Man" in messages on Twitter.
But the arrest of Ms. Meng, the daughter of Huawei's founder, threatened to open a riskier new chapter in a fight that investors increasingly see as a threat to financial markets and the economy.
"This is going to continue to be a headwind at a time when people are worried about global growth," said Dan Clifton, a head of policy research with the analysis firm Strategas.
For most of the year, the United States -- less reliant on trade than most wealthy nations -- had been a global standout, thanks in part to a burst of fiscal stimulus from the Trump tax cuts, while the trade war caused trouble in the rest of the world's financial markets.
In China, where the economy is growing at its slowest pace in almost a decade, stocks have slumped more than 20 percent. Export-based economies that are closely tied to China -- like Japan and Germany -- have started to struggle too. Growth in emerging markets, which often supply the commodities that have fueled the Chinese boom in recent decades, has also been hurt.
But in recent weeks, worry about the trade war has begun to take hold in the United States as well. Since its peak in late September, the S&P 500 has declined by 8 percent, as investors grew concerned about the outlook for corporate profits, the potential costs of the trade spat and rising interest rates, which are traditionally viewed as a negative for stocks.
The outlook for interest rates shifted suddenly on Thursday, when The Wall Street Journal published an article saying Federal Reserve officials were considering emphasizing a "wait-and-see" approach to future rate increases at the central bank's meeting later this month. Although this message was in line with previous Fed comments, the stock market began to recover soon after the article was published.
The rally did little for investors in energy shares. The sector has been hard hit by a slump in crude oil prices in recent weeks and was the worst-performing part of the S&P 500 on Thursday.
Prices for benchmark American crude oil fell more than 2 percent on Thursday, as OPEC ended its meeting on Thursday without reaching a deal to reduce oil output, even as Saudi Arabia pressed for production cuts. Exxon Mobil and Chevron both dropped more than 1 percent.
Elsewhere, yields on government bonds dropped sharply early in the day as investors flocked to the safety of Treasury debt. But the declines in yields moderated late in the day, in tandem with the shift in stock trading.
Bond yields, which move in the opposite direction of prices, tend to drop as investors downgrade expectations for growth and inflation.
Those lower yields can crimp the profitability of banks, which charge interest rates that are based on government bond yields. The threat of such pressures has hammered American financial stocks in recent days. The S&P 500 financial sector index was the second-worst-performing part of the market on Thursday, dropping 1.4 percent.
And while few expect a hasty end to the economic expansion in the United States, the recent swings in stocks suggest investors are increasingly worrying about any threats that could worsen growth forecasts.
"There's a bit of a growth slowdown in place," said Kate Moore, chief equity strategist for BlackRock. "This is a very different environment from where we were this time last year."

As the Global Economy Cools, Millions Are Still Short of a Full Recovery

Full text: LONDON -- Only a few months ago, the world's fortunes appeared increasingly robust. For the first time since the wealth-destroying agony of the global financial crisis, every major economy was growing in unison.
So much for all that.
The global economy is now palpably weakening, even as most countries are still grappling with the damage from that last downturn. Many nations are mired in stagnation or sliding that way. Oil prices are falling and factory orders are diminishing, reflecting slackening demand for goods. Companies are warning of disappointing profits, sending stock markets into a frenetic bout of selling that reinforces the slowdown.
Germany and Japan have both contracted in recent months. China is slowing more than experts anticipated. Even the United States, the world's largest economy, and oft-trumpeted standout performer, is expected to decelerate next year as the stimulative effects of President Trump's $1.5 trillion tax cut wear off, leaving huge public debts.
The reasons for this turn run from rising interest rates delivered by the Federal Reserve and other central banks to the unfolding trade war unleashed by the Trump administration. The likelihood that Britain's torturous exit from the European Union will damage trade across the English Channel has discouraged investment.
None of this amounts to a screaming emergency, or even a pronounced drop in commercial activity. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a think tank run by the world's most advanced nations, recently concluded that the global economy would expand by 3.5 percent next year, down from 3.7 percent this year.
Yet in declaring that "the global expansion has peaked," the brains at the O.E.C.D. effectively concluded that the current situation is as good as it gets before the next pause or downturn. If this is indeed the high-water mark of global prosperity, that is likely to come as a shock to the tens of millions of people who have yet to recover from the devastation of the Great Recession.
Though the slowdown appears mild, it also holds the potential to intensify the widespread sense of grievance roiling many societies, contributing to the embrace of populists with autocratic impulses. In an age of lamentation over economic injustice, and with political movements on the march decrying immigrants as threats, weaker growth is likely to spur more conflict. Slower growth is not going to make anyone feel more secure about the prospect of robots replacing human hands, or jobs shifting to lower-wage lands.
"It's just going to exacerbate the tensions that have led to the socioeconomic and political problems we have seen in the United States and parts of Europe," said Thomas A. Bernes, an economist at the Center for International Governance Innovation, a Canadian research institution. "Inequality is going to become even more pronounced."
In Greece, Spain and Italy, the youth unemployment rate is stuck above 30 percent. In Britain, the typical worker has not seen a pay raise in more than a decade, after accounting for inflation. South Africa's economy is smaller today than it was in 2010, and now the country is ensnared in recession.
In the United States, the unemployment rate has plunged to 3.7 percent, its lowest level since 1969. Yet so many people have given up looking for work that less than two-thirds of the working age population was employed as of October, according to the Labor Department. That was a lower share than before the 2008 financial crisis.
"We see a lost generation," said Swati Dhingra, an economist at the London School of Economics. "There was already wage stagnation and productivity stagnation. The trade war has exacerbated all of that."
The biggest risk to global growth appears to be that the trade war is, at least in part, working as designed.
Although the United States and China agreed on Saturday to further trade talks, Mr. Trump has excoriated China as a mortal threat to American livelihoods, accusing Beijing of subsidizing exports and stealing intellectual property. He has affixed tariffs on some $250 billion in Chinese exports in an effort to pressure Beijing to change its ways.
This has produced little change in China's economic practices. It has actually increased the American trade deficit with China, contrary to Mr. Trump's stated aim.
But it has thrown sand in the gears of China's industrial juggernaut. As of September, China's rail freight usage, bank lending and electrical consumption had increased about 9 percent compared with the previous year, down from a pace of more than 11 percent in January.
China's growth was already slowing as its leaders seek to transition from an economy powered by prodigious exports, in enterprises that have spewed pollution, toward a cleaner future propelled by domestic consumption. But the American tariffs have prompted multinational companies to shift orders from Chinese factories to plants in other lands, from Vietnam to Mexico. Uncertainty over the future has postponed some business.
"There's now potential for bad news on the trade front to trigger shifts in equity markets and a pullback on investment," said Steven J. Davis, an international business expert at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.
Given that China is the world's second largest economy, the consequences of its slowing ripple out widely, helping explain a pronounced drop in factory orders in Germany. American farmers have suffered lost sales as China has responded to tariffs by slapping duties on imports from the United States, not least on soybeans. Stock markets and oil prices have plunged in part on fears that China will buy fewer goods.
Much of the dip in American share prices reflects the increasingly embattled state of major technology companies like Facebook, which has drawn public ire for failing to prevent its platform from serving as a primary conduit for hate speech and misinformation. But technology shares have also plunged because many companies, Apple among them, now depend on China for enormous volumes of sales -- sales now at risk in the face of the trade war.
A glance at Mr. Trump's Twitter feed reveals that share prices are one of the data points he cares about deeply. As the markets recoil, the Trump administration has flashed signals that it may be prepared to entertain a cease-fire with China to limit economic damage.
But the conflict goes far beyond trade, with hawks inside the Trump administration seeking to inflict harm on China to impede its continued ascent as a global superpower. If that is the mission, Mr. Trump may be willing to absorb economic costs as the price of containment.
That take appears consistent with Mr. Trump's growing fixation on the Federal Reserve, which the president just branded "a much bigger problem than China," in an interview with The Washington Post.
In lifting interest rates, the American central bank has been acting under the accepted wisdom that too much easy money sloshing around for too long tends to produce trouble, from higher prices to financial mischief. Yet the effect of raising rates is to limit American economic growth, hence Mr. Trump's unhappiness.
The Fed's action has also visited distress on emerging markets. Higher American interest rates have prompted investors to abandon developing economies in favor of safer, more-rewarding opportunities in the United States. The changing of the tide has contributed to crises in Turkey and Argentina, while denting the value of currencies and slowing growth prospects from India to South Africa.
The European Central Bank has also been withdrawing the cheap money it unleashed to attack the crisis, phasing out purchases of bonds. This has made credit more expensive across the continent, depriving businesses of capital needed to finance expansions. And that has muted once-hopeful talk that Europe had finally transcended the torpor of the last decade.
A populist government in Italy is engaged in a standoff with European authorities over its spending plans, which breach the union's limits on deficit spending. That has prompted investors to demand higher returns for Italian debt, further squeezing credit. Mr. Trump's tariffs on steel and aluminum also appear to be cooling growth in Europe. Ditto, Britain's exit.
Only last year, Spain had emerged from a veritable depression to become a leading example of Europe regaining vigor. But Spain is expected to expand by only 2.2 percent next year, down from nearly 2.6 percent in 2018, according to the O.E.C.D. The rest of the 19 countries that share the euro currency are expected to dip from an already weak 1.9 percent rate of expansion to 1.8 percent.
"It's a bit like watching a heavily overweight bird try to take off," said Peter Dixon, a global financial economist at Commerzbank AG in London. "It staggers to the end of the runway and starts to take off but never really soars."
The same can be said for the global economy. It is clearly far removed from the terrifying days of the financial crisis. Yet it never really got its groove back enough to generate impressive numbers of jobs, or put meaningful pay increases in the pockets of ordinary people.
And now, despite all that, leaner times are unfolding.

Full text: It's not your imagination: The cost of housing in the United States really has increased a lot in the past two decades.
A recent study by Zillow compared changes in estimated median home values over a 20-year period, based on how much space a single dollar could buy. The company used home values from its online index of single-family homes, co-ops and condos, both on the market and off.
As of July 2018, a dollar bought 1.07 square inches of living space in a typical American home -- roughly half of the 2.09 square inches it bought in 1998. (The figures are not adjusted for inflation.) And in many metropolitan markets, the change was even greater. In Philadelphia, for example, a dollar bought 1.22 square inches in 2018, less than a third of the 3.79 square inches it bought in 1998.
How have home prices changed over time in the country's 10 most populous areas? Without exception, they increased from 1998 to 2008, a trend that has mostly continued over the past decade, though at a slower pace. The sole outlier was Chicago, which has become slightly less expensive in the past 10 years.

The report was recently completed, and here's the good news: The Army Corps of Engineers (most of it, anyway) and the Military Retirement Fund passed the audit.
The bad news: The Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines and most other divisions failed, which means they were unable to show that they were properly keeping track of their finances and assets.
The Pentagon has long prided itself on being a "can do" organization, firmly committed to protecting the nation. But when it comes to husbanding the billions of taxpayer dollars that pay for the vast military establishment, defense leaders have had less exacting standards.
"We failed the audit," Deputy Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan told reporters with a curiously nonchalant air. "We never expected to pass it."
The Pentagon failed the audit largely because there are serious gaps in the financial controls that guide it, the world's largest military organization. It has $2.7 trillion in assets (weapons, bases and such) and $2.6 trillion in liabilities (mostly the costs of military personnel and retirees). Basically, the auditors couldn't account for where all the money went because of flaws in information technology systems.
That laxity -- and the prospect of tax dollars flowing to boondoggles -- would be concerning at any time. But it is especially worrisome when the federal budget deficit has skyrocketed to $779 billion -- and the military is insisting it needs more money.
In a way, Mr. Shanahan's attitude is understandable. The Pentagon is an enormous bureaucracy -- three million people, 15,700 aircraft, 280 ships, 585,000 facilities at 4,700 sites worldwide, an annual budget of $700 plus billion -- and some experts say that expecting a clean bill of health on the first audit was never realistic.
Yet the Pentagon had nearly three decades to prepare for this accounting Judgment Day. While federal agencies were mandated by Congress in 1990 to begin performing annual financial audits, the Pentagon resisted for so long that it became the last one to comply with the law. Private companies, accountable to shareholders, couldn't get away with that.
But audits are hard work; most defense officials aren't business experts; and to some, bookkeeping and other management operations just aren't a priority in wartime, which since Sept. 11, 2001, has been a permanent state.
Most important, the Pentagon is skilled at bucking Congress, which is what it did all those years. This, even though the Government Accountability Office, a government watchdog, put the Defense Department on its list of agencies vulnerable to fraud, waste and abuse in 2015.
The Pentagon was granted a virtual blank check to fight terrorism, and it still gets most of what it wants. It accounts for more than half of the federal discretionary spending, with a budget greater than the military spending of the next seven countries combined, including China and Russia.
So what did the audit -- which cost some $413 million and covered every military asset, from buildings, fences, storage tanks, planes, computers, spare parts, invoices, purchase orders and contracts -- find?
There are major flaws in how the Pentagon handles its information technology. The flaws include failing to revoke the credentials of former employees and using systems that can be hacked.
Officials said the auditors accounted for all major military equipment, even discovering $53 million worth of uninstalled missile motors at Hill Air Force Base in Utah that were cataloged erroneously as "not in working condition." That's an improvement from January, when defense officials acknowledged that they had lost track of 39 Black Hawk helicopters.
But the Pentagon was found to lack the systems and controls needed to "provide assurance over the existence, completeness and the valuation of inventory and related property recorded in the financial statements." In all, the audit identified 20 "material weaknesses" that "could adversely affect DoD's financial operations."
They discovered ineffective payment systems, outdated financial management information technology systems, and an inability to substantiate that Pentagon real estate assets were properly cataloged and valued, among other complaints.
The auditors estimated that the Pentagon made "improper payments" -- which lacked sufficient or appropriate documentation or approvals -- of $957 million in 2017 and $1.2 billion in 2018. While even that larger amount is a fraction of the overall Pentagon spending, such payments grew by 25 percent over those two years, a worrying trend that needs to be reversed.
Anyone expecting the discovery of pilfered funds will be disappointed. The audit wasn't looking for fraud -- which generally refers to malicious illegal activities -- and Defense Department officials said it found none. (Different audits examine different aspects of an organization.)
Its purpose was to determine whether accounts could be reconciled, making the results less sexy, perhaps, but still important. The inability to accurately track how money is spent makes it impossible to know whether precious resources are going to the right places, undermining the Pentagon's ability to be successful in its far-flung missions around the globe.
But it would be misleading to imply that such an immense bureaucracy is not also experiencing actual fraud, abuse or waste. Cost overruns and performance issues with such major weapons as the F-35 fighter jet and missile defense systems have been well documented in the past, raising doubts about the Pentagon's ability to responsibly manage taxpayer dollars.
And the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction has spent six years documenting more than $400 million in questionable costs, unfinished projects and poorly executed programs, and pursuing 132 criminal convictions, in Afghanistan, the site of America's longest-running war.
Last month, for example, a former recruiter of language interpreters for the American military was charged in an alleged scheme to recruit unqualified interpreters to work with American combat forces in Afghanistan. And in September, the former owner of a now defunct marble mining company in Afghanistan was found guilty in federal court for his role in defrauding the Overseas Private Investment Corporation and defaulting on a $15.8 million loan.
The unfavorable audit results come at an awkward time. A recent congressionally mandated study reached the alarming conclusion that despite all the money spent on defense, the United States today is so weakened that it "might struggle to win, or perhaps lose, a war against China or Russia." The study also found that America's military superiority and technological edge over those two major adversaries has eroded.
The Pentagon, defense hawks in Congress and defense contractors relentlessly push for bigger military budgets and will continue to do so. The commission that did the study recommended future annual increases of 3 percent to 5 percent above inflation, which could give the Pentagon a budget of $972 billion per year by 2024, a cumulative increase of 44 percent over the current budget, according to Taxpayers for Common Sense. But throwing more money at the Pentagon doesn't automatically make it more effective. Nor does it translate into better national security, as America's "forever wars" in Afghanistan and elsewhere demonstrate.
The nation needs to be more honest about the choices it is making (investing trillions more dollars in the nuclear arsenal is especially foolhardy) and realize that other investments -- in diplomacy and development overseas, in job training and infrastructure projects at home -- are also crucial to national security.
Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and his leadership team deserve credit for finally opening the books for an audit, thus providing a baseline against which the management of future spending can be measured.
Before rushing to push Pentagon spending even higher, however, Congress, which has shirked its vital oversight role, would be well advised to make sure that critical reforms are undertaken by a stubbornly change-resistant bureaucracy, so Americans can be certain their tax dollars are being spent effectively.

Full text: BUENOS AIRES -- When plans were first made for Argentina to play host to the heads of state of the world's top economies at this week's Group of 20 summit meeting, the government saw the gathering as a golden opportunity to portray Argentina as a prosperous, stable nation.
But when the world leaders arrive in Buenos Aires on Friday, they will find a country reeling from a severe recession and rattled by a recent string of security incidents.
Among them are an attack on soccer players by a pack of unruly fans just last weekend, a suspected bombing plot by vegan activists and the recent arrest of a pair of brothers in Buenos Aires suspected of ties to the Lebanese militant movement Hezbollah.
Meanwhile, public worker strikes have led to the cancellation of scores of flights this week and snarled commutes in much of the country.
So as government officials set out to lock down much of the capital before the summit meeting, Patricia Bullrich, the top security official, had a blunt piece of advice to residents of the city of nearly 2.9 million: Consider hitting the road.
"Our recommendation is to use the long weekend to get out, to leave on Thursday because the city will be complicated," Ms. Bullrich said.
That advice was incongruous with the high hopes Argentina's government expressed just a year ago when it assumed the G-20 presidency.
"We inspire confidence around the world because they see we're going down the right path," President Mauricio Macri said then.
During a 12-year era of leftist rule by Presidents NÃ©stor Kirchner and his wife, Cristina FernÃ¡ndez de Kirchner, Argentina defaulted on its foreign debt, which drove investors away, and cultivated close ties with China and Russia as it drifted away from the United States.
Since his election in 2015, Mr. Macri, a center-right politician, has sought to restore the confidence of investors by reining in public spending. He has also realigned Argentina's foreign policy by cultivating closer ties with the Trump administration.
And he has pushed to position Argentina as a prominent actor in global debates on issues like climate change, migration and trade policy.
"We went from being a country that was on the global sidelines" to having the responsibility of planning the G-20, Mr. Macri said last year. "We have to take advantage to make sure the world sees all our potential, live and in person."
Instead, leaders from the world's largest economies will arrive to a country that is facing many difficulties, particularly with its economy, that have contributed to a plunge in Mr. Macri's approval ratings.
As the Argentine currency devalued precipitously earlier this year, Mr. Macri took the politically painful step of turning to the International Monetary Fund for a loan. Then, just months later, that loan had to be expanded.
Still, without much good news to show, Argentine officials are going to great lengths to pull out an orderly summit meeting.
The government is deploying 22,000 security forces and closing off large sections of the capital to protect the visiting heads of state and their delegations. The city of Buenos Aires declared Friday a holiday to ease traffic and encourage people to leave town.
Officials are mindful of the riots that marred the G-20 summit in Hamburg, Germany, last year. Critics of globalization of capitalism burned cars, looted businesses and clashed with the police in confrontations that left hundreds injured and led to the arrest or detention of more than 400 people.
This year's meeting comes at a period of considerable social unrest in Buenos Aires, where protests and street blockades have become a near daily occurrence. And December has historically been a month when these types of demonstrations turn violent, particularly at times of economic upheaval.
The suggestion that residents of the capital leave town during the event was met with outrage by Argentines, who have been struggling to make ends meet amid soaring inflation.
"I barely have enough money for food and she wants me to leave the city?" said Paula Valladares, 46, a caregiver to the elderly. "I need to work. If I don't work, I don't eat."
Anyone who tried to get an early start to the recommendation faced some trouble on Monday as all flights by the state-owned airline AerolÃ­neas Argentinas were canceled because of a workers' strike.
Early Tuesday morning, all public transport came to a halt for three hours in another strike.
Even before this weekend's attack on a bus transporting Boca Junior soccer players to a stadium -- in which several players were injured, leading to the postponement of a long-awaited match that will now take place outside the country -- the city was already on edge after bomb threats led to the evacuation of the American Embassy, the regional airport, the Senate, a bank and a hospital.
Those all proved to be false alarms.
But earlier in the month, a group of vegan anarchists were accused of leaving an explosive device in Recoleta Cemetery, the place of rest of several important figures in Argentine history, including the former first lady Eva Duarte de PerÃ³n.
One of the people implicated in the plot was injured after the device apparently detonated prematurely.
The government also blamed an anarchist group for a homemade bomb that was thrown at a judge's home.
Another unusual episode that made headlines was the arrest in mid-November of two Argentine citizens accused of having links to Hezbollah. Their family vehemently denied that the two men, ages 23 and 25, were terrorists.
The Center for Legal and Social Studies, a human rights group in Argentina, charges that the country's government has used the G-20 as an "excuse to further harden its speech against social protest and street demonstrations and exaggerate its war against terrorism."
Organizations planning the main anti-G-20 protest, taking place on Friday, say they are sure the city lockdown will affect participation. But they still expect a large turnout for a march that will end in Congress -- about three miles from where the world's most powerful leaders will be gathered.
Some in the city can't wait for the whole thing to be over and done with.
"We have such a huge country, why did they have to come here?" wondered Esteban Torres, a 31-year-old retail worker. "As if life in this city weren't difficult enough."

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve is poised to raise interest rates at its next policymaking meeting in mid-December and to continue raising rates next year, according to the minutes of the central bank's last meeting published on Thursday.
The minutes said most Fed officials were confident about the economy when they met in early November.
Some Fed officials at the meeting said they were less certain about the economic outlook and about the Fed's policy plans. But the account of the meeting provided no indication that the central bank is preparing to pause, notwithstanding the hopes of investors and frequent public attacks by President Trump.
"Almost all participants expressed the view that another increase in the target range for the federal funds rate was likely to be warranted fairly soon," barring unpleasant developments, the minutes said.
The Fed's policy arm, the Federal Open Market Committee, last raised its benchmark rate in September, to a range of 2 percent to 2.25 percent, then left the rate unchanged at the November meeting. The central bank is widely expected to increase the rate by a quarter of a percentage point in December.
The stock market surged on Wednesday after investors interpreted a speech by the Fed's chairman, Jerome H. Powell, as an indication that the central bank may leave rates closer to the current level. The minutes, however, contained no hint of any such shift in plans at the time of the meeting. Analysts said they were skeptical that the Fed meant to signal a change on Wednesday.
Paul Ashworth, chief United States economist at Capital Economics, said that the market had overreacted, and that the minutes "do not suggest that Fed officials anticipated an imminent pause in the tightening cycle." He said he expected a rate increase in December and two more during the first half of 2019.
The market's reaction on Thursday was much more subdued, with the S&P 500 index closing down 0.2 percent.
The Fed is seeking to wean markets from the expectation that it would continue to raise its benchmark rate every quarter. A rate increase in December would be the fifth straight quarterly increase.
The account emphasized that the central bank's policy "was not on a preset course," a phrase Mr. Powell also has used in recent remarks. The minutes said the Fed might remove language that predicts "further gradual increases" from its next policy statement to underscore the point that officials will make decisions based on the latest data. But the central bank also said most officials expect "further gradual increases."
Mr. Trump has loudly complained that the Fed is throttling growth by raising rates. He renewed his attacks earlier this week, insisting in a pair of interviews that the Fed's march toward higher rates posed a significant threat to the economy.
Some economists agree with Mr. Trump that the Fed should take a break from raising rates, noting that there is little sign that the economy is in danger of overheating. The Commerce Department reported on Thursday that a key measure of inflation rose by 1.78 percent over the 12 months ending in October, below the 2 percent annual pace that the central bank regards as optimal.
"The Fed's mandate is price stability, and price growth has actually slowed," Jason Furman, a Harvard economist who was chairman of President Barack Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, wrote on Twitter on Wednesday. "I don't understand why wages and prices are moving in different directions, it is very plausible that price growth will pick up again. But I don't see much cost to a pause while we figure it out."
Lawrence Summers, who served as Mr. Obama's chief economic adviser, also has urged caution. In an interview with Fox Business Network scheduled to air on Friday, Mr. Summers said he disapproved of the way Mr. Trump was expressing his concerns, but he agreed with the substance. "I do think that there are more risks of overtightening than there are of under-tightening right now," he said.
Mr. Powell has said that the central bank is moving forward with rate increases because the economy is in good health, and that the Fed is trying to strike a balance between allowing the current expansion to continue and ensuring that inflation remains under control.
The economy grew at a 3.5 percent annualized pace in the third quarter, job growth is strong and wages are rising, buttressing the intentions of Fed officials to continue raising rates.
But the minutes noted "some signs of slowing in interest-sensitive sectors" like housing and car sales and said that "conditions remain depressed" in the agricultural sector because of trade tensions.
Fed officials at the November meeting also reviewed a change in the mechanics of monetary policy that the central bank adopted after the 2008 financial crisis.
Before the crisis, the Fed raised interest rates by draining reserves from the banking system. During the crisis, the Fed purchased trillions of dollars in Treasuries and mortgage bonds, which it paid for by pumping reserves into the banking system. The Fed could have reversed the process before raising rates. Instead, it chose to raise rates in a new way, by paying banks to leave reserves untouched.
The Fed is slowly reducing its bond holdings, and officials are debating whether to slash them to a level that would allow a return to the pre-crisis system. The account of the November meeting said officials were pleased with the new system, which has increased the Fed's control over financial and economic conditions, but made no final decision.
Officials did approve a small tweak. Under the new approach, the Fed aims to keep its benchmark rate near the midpoint of a quarter-point range. Initially, the interest rate the Fed paid banks on reserves was set at the top of the range.
But earlier this year, the Fed set the interest rate on reserves 0.05 percentage point below the top of the range, to help keep the benchmark rate closer to the middle of the range. That has been insufficient, and Fed officials approved a further reduction, if necessary before the December meeting, according to the minutes.

Not Everyone Is Cheered By Decline in Oil Prices

Full text: HOUSTON -- Oil prices have plunged by about 25 percent in the last month while the cost of gasoline has tumbled to as little as $2 a gallon in several states. President Trump is pushing for even lower prices, calling it "a big Tax Cut for America and the World."
But Mr. Trump is playing a tricky game. The United States became the world's largest oil producer this year, and a collapse in prices could hurt scores of businesses and hundreds of thousands of workers in the energy and manufacturing industries. The damage would be particularly severe in states like Texas, Oklahoma and North Dakota that voted for the president.
Oil, which is trading at around $50 a barrel, is close to an economic sweet spot. Prices are not so high that they are a burdensome tax on consumers and businesses, and not so low as to bankrupt energy companies and strain the finances of major oil exporters like Saudi Arabia and Russia.
"Trump tweets as if he has a joystick and he has everything under his command like he is playing one of these video games," said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis at the Oil Price Information Service.
Mr. Trump is expected to discuss oil prices with the crown prince of Saudi Arabia at the Group of 20 summit meeting at the end of the week. That conversation will come days before the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is expected to set production targets.
If he persuades major oil-producing nations to maintain their current output, "oil prices could go down to the low 40s," Mr. Kloza said.
That kind of drop would have been an unalloyed economic boon for the United States just a dozen years ago, when domestic oil production was declining and the country was becoming increasingly dependent on unstable or unfriendly countries like Venezuela and Nigeria.
But lower prices will have a more ambiguous impact now. After the boom in drilling in shale fields, oil production in the United States has more than doubled since 2008, to upward of 11 million barrels a day now, and the country has become a major exporter. Exxon Mobil, Chevron and other oil companies have made huge investments and employ tens of thousands of workers across the country.
After prices began to slide in late 2014, more than 160,000 oil workers lost their jobs. Hundreds of smaller drillers went bankrupt, putting pressure on banks and investors. Manufacturers and other businesses that supply the energy industry also took a hit.
At the time, OPEC decided not to cut production in order to retain market share and undercut American shale producers. That decision set off a three-year slump in prices.
"Of course I'm concerned because the price of oil is dropping like crazy right now," said Darlene S. Wallace, president of Columbus Oil, a small Oklahoma producer. "I was making a profit this year for the first time in four years, and now it doesn't look like it will end up that way toward the end of the year."
But the drop in prices has clearly been a boon to people and businesses that use oil.
Americans consume roughly 400 million gallons of gasoline a day, so every time prices fall by a penny they save about $4 million. The average retail price for regular gasoline is about $2.50 a gallon, according to AAA, about the same as a year ago. But that is $1.60 a gallon less than it was a decade earlier, when the shale-oil boom was just starting.
In addition to the benefits of lower prices for consumers, Mr. Trump appears to want a well-supplied oil market so he can press countries to cut their imports from Iran without worrying about running out of fuel. Lower energy costs should also tamp down inflation, which in turn would help keep interest rates low at a time when some analysts fear an economic slowdown.
The president might have some success in getting Saudi Arabia not to cut oil production because of how he has handled the killing of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. Thankful for Mr. Trump's public support, the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, might be more willing to tolerate low oil prices than he would have been otherwise.
Russia also appears to be in no hurry to cut production, which is at the record level of roughly 11 million barrels a day. Igor Sechin, chief executive of the Russian oil company Rosneft and an influential ally of President Vladimir V. Putin, has aggressively promoted drilling at home and abroad. Mr. Putin recently said he was satisfied with the current price of oil.
Given all those political calculations, Mr. Kloza and other energy analysts say that Saudi Arabia is likely to cut production modestly, and lobby other producers to do the same. At current prices, Saudi Arabia, which is heavily dependent on petroleum exports, can pay its bills and most oil companies can make a profit. (The global price of oil is about $60 a barrel.)
"I think everybody is keen on stability," said Sadad Ibrahim Al Husseini, a former executive vice president of Saudi Aramco. He expects OPEC will cut production by at least a million barrels a day, roughly 1 percent of global supply.
The energy minister of Ecuador, Carlos PÃ©rez, said in a recent interview that he thought prices would end up in a Goldilocks range.
"Some talk of $60 oil. Other crazy people talk of $100 oil," said Mr. PÃ©rez, who will represent his country at the OPEC meeting next week. "But I personally think we are going to a range of between $65 and $75."
But oil prices rarely settle at such temperate levels for long.
Any OPEC cut that raises prices would encourage more drilling in the United States and other non-OPEC countries like Brazil, potentially forcing prices back down again. And if trade tensions between the United States and China depress global growth, oil prices could slide anew.
Bernard L. Weinstein, associate director of the Maguire Energy Institute at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, said it was virtually impossible to predict oil prices more than a month in advance. That is even more the case when the president is trying to jawbone energy markets and intervene in the global economy.
"We do know that after some of Trump's tweets we have seen big drops," Mr. Weinstein said. "Trump is the unpredictable factor, not just in terms of his tweets but what he is going to do in terms of his steel and aluminum tariffs, his hiking of tariffs on another $200 billion worth of Chinese goods. He is the disrupter in chief."

__________
Before stock investors decided that the Federal Reserve chairman was flagging the end of interest rate increases, the bond market was signaling the case for raising rates had weakened.
A measure of investors' expectation for inflation over the next five years has fallen in recent weeks. The difference between the yields on five-year Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS, and the corresponding Treasuries hit 1.74 percentage points Wednesday, its lowest level of the year, according to Tradeweb. That spread is effectively the market's forecast of where inflation is heading, and it's down from 2.04 points at the start of October.
Inflation is core to the Fed's mission. The central bank has a dual mandate of spurring full employment and keeping prices stable. This market's forecast for inflation is below the Fed's target for inflation of 2 percent.
Critics of measures like the one above say it's too sensitive to short-term moves in markets such as oil (and, indeed, the most recent pullback in inflation expectations has corresponded with the tumble in oil prices over the past nine weeks).
Still, the recent slide in the expectations is an indication that investors have grown more concerned about global growth and less worried that the United States' economy will overheat and cause a jump in inflation.
The Fed has pressed ahead with rate increases this year as the economy has strengthened. Already, the central bank has raised its main policy rate three times and is expected to do so again next month.
But in recent weeks, Fed officials also have appeared to soften their tone about future rate increases. On Wednesday, stocks surged after remarks by the central bank's chairman, Jerome H. Powell, were interpreted by investors to suggest the Fed could be nearing the end of its push to lift interest rates.
Mr. Powell said interest rate increases were approaching a "neutral" level at which it would no longer provide a stimulus to economic activity. The description contrasted with his statement in October, following the last change in the benchmark rate, that the rate was still "a long way" from neutral.
The personal consumption expenditures price index, the Fed's preferred measure of inflation, has ticked up this year and was at 2 percent in September.

Markets Soar on Two Words From Fed Chairman

Full text: With just two words on Wednesday, the Federal Reserve's chairman sent stocks surging by raising hopes that the central bank might be closer to ending its push to drive up interest rates.
The chairman, Jerome H. Powell, said the Fed's benchmark interest rate was "just below" the neutral level, meaning the central bank was close to the point where it would not be tapping on the brakes or pressing on the gas. Only last month, Mr. Powell had said it was "a long way" from neutral, leaving investors worried that the rate increases would crimp growth.
The small change sent stocks soaring 2.3 percent, erasing the losses from a rocky November. To investors, the new wording meant that the Fed might leave rates closer to their current level, keeping in place the steady fuel that low rates have provided to a 10-year-long bull market.
[Before stocks surged after Mr. Powell's comments, the bond market was signaling the case for raising rates had weakened.]
Analysts quickly warned that investors were overreacting. There was little evidence in the rest of Mr. Powell's speech that he intended to signal a change in plans.
But the market's euphoria underscored the chairman's struggles to strike the right pitch in an increasingly challenging economic and political environment, as President Trump attacks the Fed and the country's growth comes under pressure. The market has been jittery over concerns that further rate increases could undermine the economy at a time when the prospects for companies and consumers may be softening.
The economy has been a picture of health, expanding at a 3.5 percent annualized pace during the third quarter. The unemployment rate has fallen to 3.7 percent, its lowest level in almost half a century. Inflation has picked up this year, and Mr. Powell on Wednesday highlighted signs of increased risk-taking in some financial markets, including lending to corporations.
But Mr. Trump has relentlessly criticized the central bank, and Mr. Powell in particular, for raising interest rates, arguing that the Fed is choking growth. Emerging signs of weakness in some parts of the economy, including auto manufacturing, agriculture and housing, are also raising concerns that the best part of the long recovery might now be in the rearview mirror.
"We're in the 10th year of the expansion, and there are some soft points," said Ellen Hughes-Cromwick, a former chief economist at the Ford Motor Company and the Commerce Department who is now the associate director of the University of Michigan's Energy Institute. "The auto sales cycle has peaked, and the housing cycle also has peaked."
Ms. Hughes-Cromwick said that she did not foresee an imminent end to growth, but that higher interest rates, combined with rising inflation and faltering corporate confidence, could set the stage for a recession. If those things happen, "I don't really see how the economy can keep powering ahead," she said.
Most economic forecasters, including at various government agencies and big Wall Street banks, expect the American economy to continue growing in 2019. But there is a broad consensus that the pace will slow as the sugar high provided by the Trump administration's $1.5 trillion tax cut and spending increases begins to wear off. Some forecasters see a small, but growing, chance of a recession.
"This is a geriatric expansion," said David Kelly, chief global strategist at J. P. Morgan Asset Management.
He noted that if growth continued through next summer, this would become the longest expansion of the American economy since at least the Civil War. Economists have long argued that expansions do not die of old age. But the end of Mr. Trump's stimulus is likely to drop growth back toward a 2 percent annual rate, leaving little margin for error.
"It wouldn't take much to go wrong to put us into a recession," Mr. Kelly said.
Mr. Trump's chief economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, tried to play down such concerns on Tuesday.
"There's a certain amount of pessimism I'm reading about. Maybe it has to do with a mild stock market correction," Mr. Kudlow said, before saying such fears were misplaced. He rattled off recent economic data -- including the latest jobs report, which he described as "very spiffy" -- before concluding, "We're in very good shape."
Mr. Powell also reiterated Wednesday that the economy was doing well, that inflation was under control and that no glaring risks were on the horizon. Against that backdrop, the Fed is still expected to raise its benchmark rate in December. Mr. Powell emphasized that the Fed would make decisions about future increases by keeping a close eye on the economy.
"We know that moving too fast would risk shortening the expansion," he said Wednesday, in remarks before the Economic Club of New York. "We also know that moving too slowly -- keeping interest rates too low for too long -- could risk other distortions in the form of higher inflation or destabilizing financial imbalances."
The Fed's benchmark rate currently sits in a range of 2 percent to 2.25 percent. In September, Fed officials estimated that the neutral rate is between 2.5 percent and 3.5 percent. Most officials predicted the central bank would raise rates three times in 2019.
In the view of many analysts, Mr. Trump and Mr. Powell themselves pose the greatest threats to continued growth.
Mr. Trump's trade war with China is inflicting pain on some parts of the economy, notably in the Midwestern farm belt, where growers of soybeans and other crops have lost access to their largest export market.
The Fed's interest rate increases are also weighing on some parts of the economy, including home building. Sales of new and existing homes have fallen in recent months as interest rates on mortgage loans have risen.
The automobile industry is being battered by the tariffs and rate increases. Mr. Trump's tariffs on aluminum and steel have raised costs, while higher rates have discouraged some potential buyers. Auto sales have been in decline since 2016, and General Motors said this week that it would cut 14,000 jobs and shut down five North American factories.
Mr. Trump has insisted loudly and repeatedly that the Fed should be held responsible for any economic weakness. In an interview with The Washington Post on Tuesday, the president said the Fed was a "much bigger problem than China."
"I'm not being accommodated by the Fed," Mr. Trump told The Post. "I'm not happy with the Fed. They're making a mistake because I have a gut, and my gut tells me more sometimes than anybody else's brain can ever tell me."
In publicly berating the Fed, Mr. Trump is breaking sharply with the practice of recent administrations, which maintained a studied silence about monetary policy.
One reason is that urging the Fed to move can be counterproductive. The Fed likes to present itself as a technocratic institution that floats above the political fray. While some policymakers and economic analysts argue that the Fed should suspend rate increases, such a pause would now expose the Fed to criticism that it is acceding to Mr. Trump.
Mr. Powell has insisted that the Fed will act without regard to Mr. Trump's statements. In a recent speech, he emphasized that the central bank is overseen by Congress, not the president.
But Mr. Powell added to his own challenges in October, in an unscripted answer to a question about how high the Fed might need to raise rates.
"We may go past neutral," Mr. Powell said during an interview at the Atlantic Festival, "but we're a long way from neutral at this point, probably."
Mr. Powell's subsequent remarks on the subject strongly suggest that he would have liked to have chosen his words more carefully. Mr. Powell and other Fed officials also have emphasized that the exact level of the neutral rate is not important to the central bank's plans.
Some Fed officials, however, have said they want to pause at that point to consider whether further increases are warranted. Others have said they want to raise rates more, judging that the economy will need a little restraint.
Richard H. Clarida, the Fed's vice chairman, said on Tuesday that deciding how high to go would require "judgment and humility."

Full text: LOS ANGELES -- Thanksgiving movie audiences stuck with the equivalent of grandma's green beans almondine -- the tried and true. A well-reviewed sequel from Walt Disney Animation, "Ralph Breaks the Internet," sold the most tickets, followed by "Creed II," the eighth film in the "Rocky" series.
But original offerings, including a newfangled "Robin Hood" and the political drama "The Front Runner," were scraped into the garbage disposal.
"Ralph Breaks the Internet," with a voice cast led by John C. Reilly and Sarah Silverman, collected an estimated $55.7 million at North American theaters over the weekend, for a total of $84.5 million since arriving on Wednesday, according to Comscore. Its series predecessor, "Wreck-It Ralph," took in $49 million over its first three days in theaters in early November 2012, or about $55 million after adjusting for inflation.
"Ralph Breaks the Internet," which cost Disney at least $300 million to make and market, collected an additional $41.5 million in a handful of foreign countries, including China.
"Creed II," which also received mostly favorable reviews, took in a strong $35.3 million between Friday and Sunday in the United States and Canada, for a total of $55.8 million since arriving on Wednesday -- 22 percent above the Thanksgiving 2015 debut of "Creed," after adjusting for inflation.
[Read our critics' reviews of "Creed II" and "Ralph Breaks the Internet"]
Michael B. Jordan and Sylvester Stallone reprise their roles in "Creed II," which cost roughly $100 million to make and market and involved multiple studios, including Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Annapurna and Warner Bros. "Creed II" will start to arrive in wide overseas release this week.
It was not a happy holiday for Lionsgate, which released "Robin Hood" on 2,827 screens in North America. Audiences seemed to agree with critics, who largely reviled this updated version of the classic story: Ticket sales added up to about $9.1 million between Friday and Sunday, for a total of $14.2 million since arriving on Wednesday. Lionsgate spent about $100 million (not including marketing costs) to make "Robin Hood," which was produced by Leonardo DiCaprio and a partner, Jennifer Davisson. Lionsgate recouped some of its investment by selling overseas distribution rights.
While still playing in relatively limited release -- 807 locations -- ahead of a planned wider rollout next weekend, "The Front Runner" (Sony) can be declared a major box-office misfire. The film, which received mixed reviews and stars Hugh Jackman as the 1988 presidential contender Gary Hart, took in about $885,000 over the five-day Thanksgiving period. "The Front Runner" was independently financed by Bron Studios of Canada and Creative Wealth Media.
Also of note: Alfonso CuarÃ³n's critically acclaimed "Roma" played in a handful of theaters in New York and Los Angeles, part of an olive branch by its distributor, Netflix, to awards voters. Netflix declined to report ticket sales, however.
In spot checks over the weekend, it appeared that "Roma" played to sold-out or nearly sold-out screenings. Netflix will push "Roma" into a more theaters next weekend, ahead of its worldwide streaming release on Dec. 14.

An Economy That Became No. 2 by Defying No. 1

Full text: Milton Friedman had a message for China: To get rich, it must be free.
It was 1988. The Soviet Union was tottering. Across Eastern Europe, the communist order was on the verge of collapsing. Trying to avoid its own demise, the Chinese Communist Party had taken small steps toward unshackling its economy from the state. But prices for food and other necessities were surging as a result, and the party's reformers wanted advice.
They invited Mr. Friedman -- the Nobel laureate and champion of economic freedom -- to Zhongnanhai, the walled compound in Beijing where the country's most senior leaders live and work. Sitting down with Zhao Ziyang, the Communist Party's top leader, Mr. Friedman was tactful but insistent. If Beijing wants to help its people thrive, he said, the state must let go faster.
"I hope the Chinese people can become strong and prosperous," he told Mr. Zhao. "I wish to see China's reform succeed so that she can contribute more to the progress of mankind."
China made a different choice. Mr. Zhao and other reformists were ousted a year later. Tanks were sent to Tiananmen Square to teach the people a bloody lesson about challenging the party's power.
China would instead reform on its terms. It would free entrepreneurs to seek their fortunes, while still keeping a tight grip on essential economic levers. It would set national goals, then persuade or force people and companies to meet them. It would open up to the world at its own pace -- and the Communist Party would run the show.
To Mr. Friedman and other top economists, the strategy should have failed. Centrally planned economies breed waste and corruption. Big government ambitions cripple future generations with debt. Price controls lead to hunger and want. Official prognosticators invariably blow it. The Soviet Union proved that.
Those experts were wrong. China prospered.
Today it is the world's second-largest economy. Hundreds of millions of its people have been lifted out of poverty. It is home to the world's biggest auto industry, the second-most billionaires and the largest single group of internet users. It has some of the richest and most powerful technology companies on the planet.
China succeeded by creating its own model. It borrowed some Western ideas while rejecting others. It opened itself to the world when necessary, and put on the brakes when it chose to. It set goals and backed them with government money. It freed its people to make and spend money, but it forbade them to ask for a better deal. Entrepreneurs built modern China, and the Communist Party kept them in line.
Other potential success stories in Asia and Latin America stuck to the economic script and stumbled. They slashed budgets when international experts told them to, hurting growth. They opened up to the world before they were fully ready to compete -- and were tripped up by global turbulence. China's government, by contrast, reformed slowly and sometimes reluctantly, stepping in when external or internal forces threatened its rule. During financial crises that struck Asia in 1997 and then the world in 2008, China gained strength as other nations faltered.
China's economy now stands as an alternate narrative to Western ideals. And yet the decisions the Communist Party made to secure its economic future have led Beijing to its biggest test since Tiananmen Square.
Its goals -- a complicated mix of juicing the economy, cleaning up the country's air and water and meeting its people's rising expectations -- have become harder to reach. Its efforts to spur growth have left the country staggering under trillions of dollars in debt, while the world is taking aim at China's industrial ambitions.
And after three decades of balancing freedom and authoritarianism, China may be leaning too far toward state control under Xi Jinping, the country's top leader. The Communist Party may be putting too much stock in its own abilities at the expense of the entrepreneurs who drove China's success.
Milton Friedman might have been right after all.
Or China may still find its way.
Over and over, China has been underestimated by legions of leaders and economists who thought they knew better. "It's not only the West," said Justin Lin Yifu, a former chief economist at the World Bank, who was born in Taiwan but defected to China. "It's almost every country in the world. It's the multilateral institutions and the academics and intellectuals."
A Booming Bird Cage
Deng Xiaoping, the paramount leader of China, was worried. After the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown, his great Chinese experiment faced collapse.
He had led the country out of the chaos of the Cultural Revolution under the idea that its people should make more money. Farmers were given greater choice to plant what they liked and sell it for a profit. Entrepreneurs flocked to special economic zones, essentially capitalist petri dishes where they paid lower taxes and made their own business decisions. The economy surged, millions of people were lifted out of poverty, and China's growth become the envy of the world.
The boom, though, fostered inflation and corruption. When the tanks rolled through Tiananmen Square, they killed not just pro-democracy activists but also common people angry at surging prices for rice, vegetables and vinegar. The reformers were ousted, and the conservatives who took their place reasserted state control.
By 1990, foreign investors were fleeing and some Communist Party cadres were again suppressing entrepreneurs. Growth had fallen to one-third that of the boom years. Deng feared that, without a spark, the Communist Party would lose its control over China. Reform, he decided, had to be on the agenda again.
Finding the right balance would prove the economic foundation of modern China. Loosen the grip too much, and the Communist Party begins to face a real threat to its hold on power. Tighten too much, and it threatens to squelch the country's growth.
Reform has swung in one direction or the other, but it has long fit into the model of what one of the architects of modern China, Chen Yun, called a "bird cage economy." Entrepreneurs were free to spread their wings, as long as they stayed within the cage of government control.
In 1992, Deng embarked on his "southern tour" -- a visit to Shenzhen and other emerging capitals of Chinese commerce. He laid out the case for a "socialist market economy" that would twin an embrace of markets with respect for the Communist Party.
"If China does not practice socialism, does not carry on with 'reform and opening' and economic development, does not improve the people's standard of living, then no matter what direction we go," he said, "it will be a dead end."
He championed the lessons of people in Shenzhen like Shao Chunyou. Mr. Shao, now a successful entrepreneur who owns an electronics manufacturing company, was one of the hundreds of millions of Chinese who struck a silent pact with his country to pursue riches while staying out of the state's business.
The crackdown in Tiananmen Square was far from Mr. Shao's mind when he arrived that summer in Shenzhen. A penniless carpenter from a city in China's interior, he struggled to find work among the electronics factories and garment mills. He wasn't allowed to live in Shenzhen without a government permit, so when the police came looking for illegal workers he would hide in a cemetery. Once, he lived off discounted mooncakes after China's Mid-Autumn festival holiday.
"I still can't bear looking at mooncakes," he said.
Three years later, in 1992, Mr. Shao was earning more money at a factory making hardware parts for electronics than he had ever made before. Such successes would cement the country's path.
Conservative leaders were sidelined for reformers. Local officials loosened up, and banks started lending. China abolished ration coupons for food and drastically reduced the government's role in setting prices for grain, oil and coal. China's entrepreneurs responded. Growth surged into double digits.
Two years later, the International Monetary Fund and other leading economic institutions publicly worried that China's growth was too fast and threatened to spiral out of control. But the lessons from past failures taught China's leaders to complement their reform efforts with aggressive government action at certain moments.
The leadership forced down prices of essentials like grain, eggs, vegetables and real estate. Even as it pressured bloated state-owned companies to streamline, it often gave them breathing room. Then, when prices fell, China gave a variety of industries -- everything from tractor and electronics factories to ostrich breeders -- the power to form cartels to stay in business.
The approach worried free-market economists. While they widely acknowledged that China couldn't change overnight, they argued that state control hobbled the economy by pouring money into wasteful targets.
Mr. Friedman, the Nobel laureate, gave voice to those concerns when he returned to China in 1993. China's entrepreneurs, he noted approvingly, were thriving. But everywhere, he saw the domineering presence of the Chinese government. "Not surprisingly," he wrote later, "the managers of state-owned enterprises are not at all willing to give up their powers."
Mr. Friedman was shocked at the scale of a government-led project to build what was in effect a new city, Pudong, across the Huangpu River from Shanghai. "A Potemkin village built for a reigning emperor," Mr. Friedman wrote, predicting disaster.
A decade later, Pudong was one of Asia's hottest real estate markets.
Opening and Dragging
While China was getting richer, it wasn't enough by the end of the 1990s. It was still home to about one in five of the world's poorest people. Inflation ping-ponged, demanding constant government attention. Beijing pushed state-owned companies to get leaner and work smarter, leading to the layoffs of millions of workers.
China needed growth. To get there, the leadership reasoned, it had to join the World Trade Organization, the premier global commerce club. Membership would mean lower tariffs for China's manufacturers and give foreign companies the confidence to invest more in the country. Membership would also free China from the annual scrutiny that American lawmakers gave its human rights record before extending favorable trading terms.
The rest of the world expected that China would be forced to adopt greater political and economic freedoms to compete. "The more China liberalizes its economy, the more fully it will liberate the potential of its people -- their initiative, their imagination, their remarkable spirit of enterprise," President Bill Clinton said in 2000.
Casting aside wasted years of halfhearted negotiations, China launched an all-out effort to get in. It yielded on a number of demands made by the United States and others. It agreed to slash tariffs and lower trade barriers to telecommunications, the financial sector and a host of other industries. It agreed to curb subsidies.
In the bargain, China got what it wanted, paving the way for a global trading colossus.
After China's entry in the W.T.O. in 2001, its exports doubled in three years and nearly tripled in four. Investment poured into the country. Global manufacturers moved entire operations to China, while consumers around the world got cheaper tools, toys and phones.
"When China joined the W.T.O., I was so excited that I cried," said Zhu Dingding, the general manager of Hangzhou Jinyuan, which makes baby shoes and other crafts.
By 2011, orders were 10 times what they had been in 2001. He made enough money to buy a car, a Volkswagen. Three apartments followed, all purchased without mortgages.
"The W.T.O. pushed my business to develop rapidly," Mr. Zhu said. "Without the W.T.O., it would be impossible."
But China didn't change that much.
Beijing has kept its iron grip on critical levers of the economy. It has been slow to meet commitments to open up key parts of its financial system, while other essential areas like telecommunications remain cut off. It has continued to nurture businesses aimed at meeting its technological and political goals, like high-speed rail and solar panels. It hasn't fully relaxed its grip on the value of the country's currency.
China's entry into the W.T.O. caused a systemic shock, one underestimated particularly by the United States. Cheap Chinese goods ushered in a new era of low prices, upending industries from textile mills in South Carolina to circuit board manufacturers in Japan and fashion designers in Italy. One study suggested that, between 1999 and 2011, Chinese imports eliminated one million American manufacturing jobs, plus more in other industries.
"China's entrance into the World Trade Organization has enabled the greatest jobs theft in the history of our country," Donald J. Trump said at a campaign appearance in 2016, four months before he was elected president.
'Can China Save the World?'
As the global financial system tottered in 2008, an influential Chinese leader chastised Henry M. Paulson, then the United States Treasury secretary and a former Goldman Sachs executive.
The leader, Wang Qishan, was among the first Chinese officials to soak in the lessons of the free market evangelists. But he told Mr. Paulson that China had perhaps listened to the West long enough.
"You were my teacher, but now here I am in my teacher's domain, and look at your system, Hank," Mr. Wang said, according to Mr. Paulson. "We aren't sure we should be learning from you anymore."
Nobody was unscathed by the global financial crisis. Washington bailed out Wall Street and Detroit, then its efforts slowed to a crawl as a new president, Barack Obama, clashed with Congress over the size of a stimulus package. Europe also fell into squabbling as individual countries fell into crisis, creating cracks in the union.
While China withstood the initial shock, the ripples threatened to become devastating. Exports plunged and economic growth slowed as foreign markets dried up. Factories began to lay off workers. Later, economists at the World Bank would estimate that as many as 36 million Chinese workers had lost their jobs.
What followed was perhaps the greatest show of financial firepower the world has ever seen -- and it wouldn't have been possible without government controls that would have made Milton Friedman blanch.
Beijing unleashed a nearly $ 600 billion spending package in an effort to rev up its economy. It called for building rail lines, highways, power lines and other big infrastructure projects across the country.
Then it began to lend. The central bank flooded the country with money, and China's economic leaders told its government-backed banks to start giving out loans. State-run companies were told to build and invest, and local government officials were told to help them. By one estimate, the financial stimulus totaled, over three years, nearly $ 1.4 trillion.
Asked one headline, "Can China Save the World?"
In some ways, China was well positioned for this moment. Early in its embrace of capitalism, it recognized the treasure it had in the savings of its people. Currently, their savings rate is nearly three times that of the United States -- driven in part by worries that an underdeveloped social safety net won't help them when they retire or get sick.
Because the government controlled the banking system, it could force banks to extend mercy to troubled borrowers or simply roll over their loans at more agreeable terms. It could ignore the advice of global investors and institutions, like the International Monetary Fund, that preached open markets and austerity, sometimes to disastrous results.
China also kept money from leaving the country. It put limits on how much people could move overseas and kept a tight grip on the value of its currency, the renminbi.
The contrast between China and the rest of the world was stark. Beijing moved swiftly -- and its growth was the rare bright spot in the global economy. Washington didn't complete a $ 787 billion stimulus package until the next year, filled with political compromises. The American economy couldn't avoid recession.
Nicholas R. Lardy, a China expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, told American officials in 2009 that "China is the gold standard in terms of its response to the global economic crisis."
Testing China's Model
More than a quarter-century after Deng Xiaoping used his southern tour to get Chinese reform back on track, Xi Jinping followed on a mission of his own.
Mr. Xi's trip to Guangdong Province in the south last month deliberately echoed his predecessor's. Like Deng, he visited start-ups, inspected their work and gabbed with factory employees. He visited an appliance company and an auto parts plant, praising the role of small businesses in the Chinese economy. China, he said, hadn't wavered from its commitment to them.
"China's reform and opening up will never stop," Mr. Xi told a group at an exhibition center celebrating decades of reform. "The next 40 years of China will bring new achievements that will make the world take notice."
So far, Mr. Xi's rhetoric hasn't matched reality. While Deng dragged the Chinese economy further out of the clutches of state control, Mr. Xi has been pulling it back.
Despite calls to rein in debt, he has kept the money flowing. Despite a push to create global technology champions, he has put the country's vibrant internet industry under the increasing authority of the party and the state. Despite promising to lift entrepreneurs, he has strengthened state behemoths, which now account for growing shares of the country's profits and industrial production.
Mr. Xi has made some modest reforms. He has loosened, just a bit, Beijing's hold on the value of its currency. He moved to allow foreign banks and automakers to directly own their Chinese operations.
But the pendulum has markedly swung toward the state at a time when the cumulative weight of four decades of choices has left the Chinese economy vulnerable. Growth is slowing -- and juicing it won't be as easy.
The lending-and-spending binge that powered its economy, and arguably the world's, after the financial crisis has saddled the country with a huge debt load. While calculating what China owes is difficult since much is off the books, debt could total $ 41 trillion -- or three years' worth of the country's economic output. That's roughly equal to developed countries like the United States, Britain and Japan. But whereas their debt built up over decades, China's accumulated in nine years.
Moving the needle has become harder. China's economy is roughly three times the size it was in 2008. Those airport and highway projects it still uses to spur growth are expensive and deliver less economic bang.
The world has also begun to take aim at China's pace of opening up and its global ambitions. President Trump has started a trade war over China's economic barriers and its state-sponsored plans to build world-beating competitors in industries like semiconductors, robotics and electric cars.
The tariffs and tensions threaten a key cog in China's trade machine: exports of goods and services, which total about one-fifth of the country's output. The United States has also taken more forceful action against Chinese companies that it believes break the global rules of trade, in some cases depriving them of buying or investing in the American-made technology they need to survive or innovate.
And in a fundamental change, China's leaders appear to be losing their willingness to experiment. Amid fear over slowing economic growth and difficult social problems, the party's talk has turned to more control. Some increasingly strident voices within the Communist Party are tapping pre-reform language to lash out against Western ideas. Even private business ownership -- a bedrock of Deng's reform and opening up -- has been criticized in some quarters.
China may also have become complacent. Its four decades of success under the China model may have persuaded the country's leaders that the Communist Party, rather than the country's entrepreneurs, drove its success, and it has little reason to let go.
"The China model concept misleads China," said Zhang Weiying, a prominent pro-market economist, "so we're going backward."
China, of course, has changed course in the past. Pragmatism has often won out.
China's leaders received a subtle reminder of that in September -- from a son of Deng, the architect of reform. In a speech to top leaders, Deng Pufang praised their work but cautioned that once China's opening had begun, it could never go back.
"Reform and opening up is the liberation of people," he said. "It encourages the recognition of people's desire and pursuit of a happy life, it stimulates the wisdom and strength of the masses, and it provides opportunities and platforms for every ordinary person to improve their lives and change their destiny."

Full text: The opulent lifestyle of the Andrade family was as spectacular as the economic collapse of the country they left behind.
Venezuelan immigrants, the family lived in a mansion in Florida surrounded by show horses, as neighbors peeked over the property line in awe. The family patriarch, Alejandro Andrade, had been a bodyguard of President Hugo ChÃ¡vez before rising to powerful positions in his government.
This month, Mr. Andrade will be known for something else: On Nov. 27, he is expected to be sentenced for taking bribes as Venezuela's treasurer, in a money-laundering scheme that made him a billionaire.
Venezuela is facing its worst economic crisis in modern history. Inflation and devastating shortages of food and medicine have forced more than three million people to flee the country, according to the United Nations.
But among those who have left Venezuela is a small clique that made untold fortunes, including government officials, well-connected businessmen and military leaders who siphoned off billions of dollars. Many argue that this deep-rooted corruption laid the groundwork for the collapse of Venezuela today.
The beneficiaries even have a name: The "boligarchs," a term often used for the new oligarchy that emerged under Mr. ChÃ¡vez's Socialist-inspired "Bolivarian Revolution."
"How could it be that a government employee had 60 horses?" said Franklin Hoet-Linares, a Venezuelan lawyer who lives a short distance from Mr. Andrade's house in Wellington, Fla., near West Palm Beach.
Mr. Andrade's plea agreement, and an indictment outlining the bribes he received, were unsealed this week in Federal District Court in Florida. They offer a window into how fortunes were amassed by Venezuela's elite before they decamped to South Florida.
With his powerful position in Venezuela, Mr. Andrade collected a stunning array of bribes, the documents assert, including three private jets, a yacht, horses and "numerous high-end watches." In his guilty plea, Mr. Andrade admitted to receiving more than $1 billion in bribes.
He is one of many Venezuelan officials accused of enriching themselves from state coffers or illegal activities.
American officials imposed sanctions this year on Diosdado Cabello, one of Venezuela's most powerful politicians, accusing him of drug trafficking, extortion and embezzling government money. Venezuela's interior and justice minister, Nestor Reverol, is under indictment in the United States for receiving payments to help traffickers transport cocaine.
And President NicolÃ¡s Maduro's inner circle -- including his wife, his defense minister and others -- "systematically plunders what remains of Venezuela's wealth," American officials contend. Several of them are also under sanctions.
The American government's case against Mr. Andrade is, in fact, built around another Venezuelan billionaire, RaÃºl GorrÃ­n, who owns the news network GlobovisiÃ³n and has been living in Miami.
Mr. GorrÃ­n asked Mr. Andrade -- identified as "Foreign Official 1" -- to help him secure the lucrative rights to conduct foreign currency exchanges for the Venezuelan government, according to the federal documents.
When Mr. Andrade received a bill for $174,800 to transport his horses, he simply sent it to Mr. GorrÃ­n, who paid the invoice from his personal bank account in Switzerland. In 2012, Mr. GorrÃ­n sent a $20 million wire transfer from a Swiss bank to purchase an aircraft for Mr. Andrade, according to Mr. Andrade's plea deal.
Separate charges against Mr. GorrÃ­n, including nine counts of money laundering, were unsealed this week. Mr. Andrade and other Venezuelans fell under the jurisdiction of American prosecutors who say their money laundering transactions passed through the United States financial system.
Mr. Andrade has forfeited his assets -- including real estate, aircraft, horses and bank accounts -- and faces a maximum prison sentence of 10 years. Gabriel JimÃ©nez, a Venezuelan in Chicago who owned a bank used to pay the bribes, also pleaded guilty, American officials said.
In Venezuela, Mr. Andrade was known by the nickname "the One-Eye," after a common story, that Mr. ChÃ¡vez hit him in the eye by mistake during a baseball game. The two originally became close when Mr. Andrade participated in Mr. ChÃ¡vez's failed attempt to take power in a 1992 coup.
In 1998, when Mr. ChÃ¡vez ran for president and won, Mr. Andrade served as his bodyguard. A decade later, he had risen up the ranks to a much more prominent role, as the head of the treasury.
Then in 2012, not long before Mr. ChÃ¡vez died of cancer, Mr. Andrade moved to Florida.
The Andrades were perhaps best known in the United States for their horses, with a lavish collection of steeds and their colorful names, like Bon Jovi and Hardrock Z.
"He had a lot of horses," said Elizabeth Madden, an American Olympic-medal winning equestrian. "You see that in this industry, people buying horses and stuff like that. You don't know where the money comes from."
The daily life of Mr. Andrade's son, Emanuel, a show jumping competitor, remains chronicled on Instagram, where pictures can be seen of a jet-set lifestyle with competitions in London and Madrid.
In one photo, Emanuel Andrade is riding a horse in Paris with the Eiffel Tower in the background. Another picture that circulated on Latin American news sites shows Emanuel Andrade posing next to Kendall Jenner, the American model.
The elder Mr. Andrade became known in Florida social circles, too, according to McLain Ward, an Olympic equestrian medalist who said Mr. Andrade sponsored young rider events, often ones in which his son was competing.
But beyond that, the details on the family were vague, he said.
"We knew that he was a Venezuelan living here, but about his family, not so well," said Mr. Ward, who said he sold two horses to the Andrades a couple of years ago. "We knew they were involved in the government in some way."
Mr. Hoet-Linares, the Venezuelan lawyer who lives close to the Andrade mansion, said he remains angry at the profiteering of well-connected Venezuelans while many people in the country do not have enough to eat.
Two years ago, he said, he accosted Mr. Andrade at a party about the sums he had taken and the possibility of using money to reconstruct Venezuela.
"I said, 'Look, let's find a way to help the country,"' Mr. Hoet-Linares recalled. "I think he was a little surprised. He said, 'I'm off to a trip, we can talk when I'm back."'
Mr. Hoet-Linares says he did not hear back. But while the seizure of Mr. Andrade's assets is a step in the right direction, he said, it's far from enough.
"The most perverse thing about Venezuelan corruption is that the money that they take internationally and in the U.S. does not go to the treasury of Venezuela," he said.
The equestrian community this week was also at a loss for what to make of the amount of money that the Andrades had amassed.
"If he's as strong of a rider as I think he is, he'll bounce back," Allie Rose Crowell, an equestrian competitor, wrote on Facebook about Emanuel Andrade in reaction to the news.
"But I'm not forgiving people who steal a billion dollars from one of the poorest nations on the planet, and using it for their own self interest."

Full text: Are you using the best credit card for your spending habits? Is your money stored in the best places? And are you spending all that hard-earned money wisely? A team of financial experts from Wirecutter answered New York Times reader questions about credit, debt, saving and spending.
How do I calculate how long I'll live so I can decide how much money I need for retirement?
Michael Eliastam
The Takeaway There's no way to predict exactly how long you will live. Instead, focus on the maximum you can realistically save so you won't run out of money if you live longer than expected.
First, get a realistic sense of how long you might live. There are a number of free, online calculators that can estimate your life expectancy, typically based on data from sources like the National Institutes of Health and the AARP.
The federal government offers one, but it doesn't take into account factors that may influence your life span, such as your lifestyle habits, income and where you live.
Anyway, not even the most detailed calculator can predict how long you'll end up working and living, so it's not a good idea to base your retirement plan entirely on that information.
Instead, focus on what you can do with your money now to ensure you have enough to comfortably live throughout your retirement. Here are some general rules of thumb to consider:
THE 4 PERCENT SPENDING RULE: The 4 percent rule shows that retirees who withdraw 4 percent from their portfolio each year (inflation-adjusted) could still withdraw that amount and not run out for 30 years. The bigger the initial nest egg, the more you can afford to withdraw.
Here's how it works: assuming you had $1 million in retirement savings and inflation remained steady at 3 percent each year, you could withdraw $40,000 in your first year of retirement, $41,600 in the second year, and so on. 30 years later, you hypothetically would still have money in the bank.
Note: This rule has a few flaws, including an assumption that you will earn a 5 percent return every year, that expenses will remain the same each year (in good health you may spend more on travel and entertainment, and in ailing health you may spend more on health care), inflation will be exactly 2 percent, which likely will not be the case when you retire.
THE 10X INCOME RULE: Fidelity suggests having 10 times your income saved by the time you turn 67 to generally maintain your same standard of living.
THE 25X SPENDING RULE: Since annual income isn't the best predictor of wealth (some people have high incomes yet don't save, while people with low incomes could be excellent savers), other formulas prioritize personal spending habits over income. The "25 times rule" suggests that you save 25 times the amount you anticipate withdrawing from your portfolio every year.
Can I just save $1 million
and be O.K.?
Even still, some experts worry that a seemingly big figure like $1 million is not enough. The average annual spending in 2016 for people born between 1928 and 1945 was $41,763, according to the BLS 2016 Consumer Expenditure Survey. Under the 4 percent rule, you'd need more than $1 million to support that level of spend for 30 years.
Worse, saving $1 million is unattainable for most Americans. Among those with some retirement savings, the median savings amount is $148,000 for households age 65-74, according to a 2015 study from the Government Accountability Office. And those who have saved up $1 million are likely higher income earners and therefore probably accustomed to a higher standard of living, thus they may have a hard time spending less in retirement.
Of course, there are other factors to consider when weighing how much you need to save for retirement. You'll likely collect some Social Security, and other options such as annuities could provide additional income through retirement. Sally French I'm 24, and I've managed to save about $30,000 in a personal savings account; however, I would like to invest a certain amount of those savings for a 10-year return. How much and where should I look for beginning investments? I do not have any prior investment experience.
Matthias, G.S.
The Takeaway Savings should be stocked away in the following order: emergencies first, long-term goals, including retirement, next, and then the remaining money could be placed in a low-cost index fund.
Good work on starting to save early. Now, let's make sure you have your financial priorities in order:
1 Make sure you have money socked away for emergencies
Many experts suggest having three to six months' worth of living expenses in a bank account you can easily access.
A potentially good place to store this money is a high-yield savings account, where you can currently earn around 2 percent interest on your funds. You might want more than three months' worth if you work in a high-risk industry where layoffs are common, your income isn't steady or if it's during a recession.
2 Consider investing
Your question doesn't mention why you want a 10-year return but before you start investing for that goal, it's generally a good idea to prioritize saving for longer-term investments in a tax-advantaged retirement account. The general rule of thumb is the longer term your goal, the more risky you can afford to be with your investments because you have more time to recover from market fluctuations, like a recession. And since you're so young, you have the advantage of compound interest on your side.
If your employer offers a 401(k), in most cases, it's a good idea to take advantage of it. (If you do, you'll already be ahead of a lot of your peers: A 2018 study from the National Institute on Retirement Security found that even though 66 percent of millennials work for an employer that offers a retirement plan, just over half participate.)
Your 401(k) contributions are pretax dollars, and your investments will grow tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay capital gains taxes on the money you accumulate. Taxes won't kick in until you withdraw the funds in retirement (you'll pay income taxes, but the idea is that you'll be in a lower tax bracket and pay less in taxes than you'd have to pay today).
If your employer offers some sort of 401(k) match, then the deal gets even sweeter: some employers offer to match your contributions up to a certain percent (if you have a $50,000 salary and your employer matches 3 percent of your contribution, that's $1,500 extra you receive each year).
If your employer doesn't offer a 401(k), you may want to consider investing in a traditional IRA, which allows you to deduct your contributions and not pay taxes until you take distributions, while getting the benefits of tax-deferred investment growth.
You may also want to consider a Roth IRA, which is a retirement account funded by post-tax income that you can later withdraw from tax-free. You can invest up to $5,500 per year in a Roth or traditional IRA.
3 Think about
medium-term goals
I applaud you for wanting to save for medium-term goals because at your age, there are many exciting things to save for. You have a few investment options for the remaining portion of your savings, with varying levels of risk.
Since you want access to the money in the next few years, you may want to invest more conservatively than you would for a longer-term goal, like retirement. High-yield savings accounts are a great option although the approximately 2 percent you'll earn on your money is roughly equal to inflation.
Also consider a Certificate of Deposit (CD), which is an account that requires you to hold your money there for a certain time period (this period may vary but you typically have to leave your cash untouched in a CD for at least two years to get the best rate of return.) CDs typically provide better interest rates than savings accounts but you can incur penalties for withdrawing early.
If you decide you want to dip your toe in investing, think about keeping it simple to start: Consider putting your money into an index fund, which is a low-cost way to invest in a diversified group of stocks or bonds (as opposed to investing in a single company or sector, which can be much more risky).
How to Start Investing
You can open an account through a broker such as Merrill Edge or Charles Schwab (just be aware that some brokerage accounts have minimum deposit requirements). While brokers typically charge small management fees, Fidelity recently introduced two new index mutual funds that have no fees at all.
For people who want to put in minimal effort, robo-advisers such as Betterment and Wealthfront are becoming increasingly popular as a "set it and forget it approach." Robo-advisers can create an investment portfolio for you based on a series of personal questions about your income, your risk tolerance and savings goals. After you transfer money from your bank account, the robo-adviser will manage your investments for you, typically at a lower fee than a human financial adviser. Sally French
What's the best way to start saving for a potential future child's college education before you get married or have a family?
Stuart Palley, Orange County, Calif.
The Takeaway Open a 529, name yourself the beneficiary, start saving and then make your child the beneficiary of the account when they're born. But there are risks to consider.
If you're thinking about saving for college before you have a child, or even thinking about children, you're ahead of the game. You can get a big jump on your savings goal if you open a 529 plan now, make yourself the beneficiary, start contributing around $250 a month and invest in mostly stock funds. (You'll have a good shot of meeting the savings goals we mention below if you start with $250 a month.) Once your child is born, you can make him or her the beneficiary without paying any tax on the transfer.
The onslaught of college costs and student loans may incentivize you to start saving early for your child's college education. Savingforcollege.com estimates the average total cost of attendance for a four-year college, minus any grants and scholarships, at slightly more than $115,000 in 2036 dollars. (That includes room and board, fees and books.) Mark Kantrowitz, the site's vice president of research, recommends parents save one-third of that estimate in a 529 plan, one-third will come from your income and the last third should be paid by your child, who ideally should have some skin in the game.
A 529 plan is basically a Roth IRA for college savings. You make contributions to your 529 plan after tax and then invest those contributions tax-free until your child goes to college, and then withdraw funds tax-free to pay for so-called qualified higher education expenses, including, but not limited to, tuition, room and board and books. Just more than half (56 percent) of parents today are saving for college, according to Sallie Mae and Ipsos, with 30 percent of savings in a 529 plan, 22 percent in a general savings account and 14 percent in a taxable investment account.
ONE RISK TO CONSIDER What if you don't end up having children? In this case, you could withdraw your contributions without fuss, but you'd owe a 10 percent fee and taxes on any investment gains. You could also use it on yourself for continuing education. TAYLOR TEPPER
What's the new thinking on how much of your income should go toward rent? And specifically, which kind of income (gross, net) should I be using for that calculation?
The takeaway Everyone's situation is different -- a software engineer in San Francisco may need to spend more on housing than a dentist in Des Moines, but also may not need to pay for a car. Rather than thinking about housing as a separate line item in your budget, consider how your monthly rent payment fits in with other basic necessities, as well as saving, paying off debt and luxuries.
You may have heard of the 30 percent rule, which says you should pay no more than 30 percent of your gross pay on rent (it stems from a 1969 amendment to public housing requirements called the Brooke Amendment). But it's increasingly outdated because it doesn't account for expenses that are prevalent today, such as student loans. It also doesn't account for individual situations, such as how many dependents you are (or aren't) supporting.
A way to reframe how much you can afford to spend on rent is to first look at how much you can afford to save. While it may not be realistic for everyone, the 50/30/20 rule, which was coined by Senator Elizabeth Warren in her book "All Your Worth: The Ultimate Lifetime Money Plan," suggests that you set aside 20 percent (or more) of your take-home pay toward saving or paying down debt.
From there, create a budget accounting for all of your expenses. Fifty percent of your take-home pay should be applied to necessities (housing, food, health care and clothing), and no more than 30 percent of your take-home pay should be spent on wants or luxuries.
Of course, it may not be possible to keep your rent costs low. According to the last State of the Nation's Housing report from Harvard University's Joint Center for Housing Studies, 38.1 million households in the United States spent more than 30 percent of their income on housing in 2016, which was the last time this was measured. About a quarter of those households spent over 50 percent of their income on housing.
Families who pay more than 30 percent of their income for housing are considered "cost burdened" and may have difficulty affording other necessities including food, transportation and medical care, according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The increase in cost-burdened households has been driven in part by income inequality and a lack of affordable housing.
There may be situations where you can justify paying a higher percentage of your take-home pay on rent. If you live in a pricey, bustling urban center, you might be able to save on transportation expenses or even remain carless by walking to work, entertainment and shopping centers. If your rent includes laundry, cable, utilities or luxury amenities like a gym, it may free up more room in your budget. Sally French

Full text: ISTANBUL -- President Recep Tayyip Erdogan didn't get everything he wanted.
For weeks, the leader of Turkey has been trying to undermine his regional rival, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia, with a skillful drip of intelligence leaks linking the prince to a gruesome crime: the killing of a dissident, Jamal Khashoggi.
President Trump's statement on Tuesday made clear that the United States would stick with its Saudi ally, leaving Mr. Erdogan's biggest ambition -- sidelining his rival and realigning American policy in the Middle East -- unfulfilled.
"This is not credible," Numan Kurtulmus, the deputy chairman of Mr. Erdogan's political party, told reporters on Tuesday, dismissing Mr. Trump's explanation -- that no one really knew who was responsible for ordering Mr. Khashoggi's death -- as "comic."
But that does not necessarily mean Mr. Erdogan lost the geopolitical battle over the consequences of the killing.
If anything, the Turkish president may now be in a better position than he was when Mr. Khashoggi disappeared inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul seven weeks ago.
Mr. Erdogan, who has been widely criticized for locking up more than 100,000 people since an attempted coup two years ago, has gained badly needed international stature from the case. He has successfully claimed the moral high ground vacated by the American president, and he has kept up the pressure on Saudi Arabia.
"He is standing with the overwhelming majority of people in the Arab world," said Asli Aydintasbas, a senior fellow with the European Council for Foreign Relations. "People are outraged, and they do think that Erdogan is on the right side."
"Across the Arab world, there is real appreciation for what Erdogan stands for," she added. "That's what he cares about and that's what is important to him."
Beyond that, the Khashoggi case has allowed Mr. Erdogan to soften his authoritarian image in the West and potentially build some momentum toward repairing deeply strained relations with the United States.
By steadily spooling out grisly details of the killing, Mr. Erdogan has found common cause with American lawmakers outraged by Saudi Arabia's brazen tactics. Before that, some American politicians were more focused on castigating Turkey, a fellow NATO member, for backsliding on democracy and purchasing an antimissile defense system from the Russians.
"The main benefit has been with Erdogan earning political capital in Washington, which will be useful," said Sinan Ulgen, a former diplomat for Turkey and the chairman of the Center for Economics and Foreign Policy Studies in Istanbul.
Even if he failed to cause a shift in policy within the Trump administration, Mr. Erdogan is unlikely to let the Khashoggi case go. Turkey has called for a United Nations inquiry into the killing and continues to demand answers, if only to clip the wings of the Saudi prince, whom Mr. Erdogan sees as a threat.
At the height of the affair, Turkish officials were calling on Washington to shift its alliances in the Middle East, hoping to nudge the United States away from the powerful monarchies of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, as well as from the secular military leadership of Egypt.
Turkey has squared off with Saudi Arabia on a number of fronts, including the kingdom's dispute with Qatar. Mr. Erdogan's government also opposes American sanctions on Iran, putting it directly at odds with the Saudi crown prince, often known by his initials, MBS, who described Turkey as part of a "triangle of evil."
"It was a far-fetched idea that Trump would drop MBS," said Mr. Ulgen. "There will be some disappointment in Ankara, but also realism."
In fact, Turkey expected Mr. Trump's position from the start, argued Ms. Aydintasbas.
"Erdogan is a smart politician and has been around a long time," she said. "He can see where Trump is coming from," she added. "They seem to agree to disagree."
Despite the continuing anti-American sentiment often used by the Turkish government, there are signs that both sides want to repair relations.
"You can see a desire in Ankara to normalize relations with the U.S.," Ms. Aydintasbas said. "There is also a clear desire on the side of Trump to fix relations with Turkey. Erdogan does not want to ruin that."
The release last month of an American evangelist pastor, Andrew Brunson, eased Mr. Erdogan's relations with the White House and with Congress, allowing them to move forward on other disputes that have brought relations to an all-time low over the past year.
Already, Washington has signaled it is doing more to investigate a Pennsylvania-based preacher, Fethullah Gulen, whom Turkey accuses of instigating the attempted coup in 2016.
The two nations have also begun joint patrols in Manbij, in northern Syria, where Turkey and the United States have been at loggerheads. Washington supports Kurdish forces in the region, but Turkey considers them a grave security threat.
On Tuesday, Turkey's foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, indicated some acceptance of Mr. Trump's decision to side with Saudi Arabia, without backing away from the Turkish position that whoever ordered the killing should be revealed.
Many countries did not want to fall out with Saudi Arabia over the murder, he said. "We do not want that either, yet the murder should be brought to light," he said, according to the semiofficial Anadolu news agency.
Mr. Cavusoglu was in Washington on Wednesday for scheduled meetings to address several of the outstanding disputes between the two countries. Those include an impending fine on the Turkish state bank, Halkbank, for violating American sanctions on Iran, as well as Turkey's detention of American citizens and three Turkish consular employees on charges of terrorism, which American officials call baseless.
Then, there is the important front in Syria.
Mr. Erdogan rails constantly against the United States' support for Syrian Kurdish fighters, whom he considers an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party, which Turkey, the United States and Europe have all designated a terrorist organization.
While those issues remain between the countries, Mr. Erdogan is unlikely to waste the political capital he has gained through the Khashoggi case, political observers in Turkey said.
He still can threaten to release the audio recordings of the killing, which Turkish officials have said indicate high-level Saudi involvement. But analysts say that is a "nuclear option" he is unlikely to use, since it would essentially end his leverage.
On Wednesday, in a speech at the presidential palace in Ankara, Mr. Erdogan pointedly did not mention the Khashoggi case or Mr. Trump's statement of support for the Saudi crown prince.
Instead, the Turkish president was already in full campaign mode for local elections in March, showing that national political concerns still come first as he listed his latest enemies of the state.
He slammed the European Court of Human Rights for a decision calling for the release of a Kurdish political leader, Selahattin Demirtas.
He denounced an imprisoned philanthropist, Osman Kavala, who has been swept up in his post-coup crackdown.
He thundered against wholesalers, whom he accused of raising the price of onions and potatoes.
His nationalist stance has to be seen in the light of local politics, Mr. Ulgen said.
Turkey's economic difficulties, including a drastic fall in the lira and high inflation, mean Mr. Erdogan's Justice and Development Party risks losing some important municipalities in March.
"The members of the project to make Turkey kneel down, to make our country surrender, are still in solidarity," Mr. Erdogan roared, referring to the supporters of popular protests in Gezi Park and Taksim Square in 2013.
"Those praising Gezi, weren't they the ones who destroyed all the windows, burned everything around? Didn't they burn the buses belonging to the state? Didn't they burn down the artisans' shops? Shall we tolerate them?"

The Jarring Fall From Grace Of Nissan's Highest Achiever

Full text: Shortly after Carlos Ghosn took over in 1999 as chief operating officer of an ailing Nissan Motor, he overhauled the way the company paid senior employees.
Abandoning Japanese traditions that rewarded seniority and shunned incentive awards, Mr. Ghosn enforced a performance-based system and gave bonuses to midlevel managers.
The move rankled traditionalists but reflected Mr. Ghosn's outspoken belief in merit- and market-based recognition. "The highest achievers got the highest rewards," according to a case study of Mr. Ghosn's early years at Nissan, which is based in Yokohama.
He earned a reputation as one of his generation's most successful C.E.O.s, but now the way Mr. Ghosn managed his own rewards may prove to be his downfall.
On Monday, Mr. Ghosn was arrested in Tokyo after a company investigation alleged that he had deceived Japanese financial authorities about his pay package.
According to Tokyo prosecutors, Mr. Ghosn and Greg Kelly, a onetime Nissan human resources manager and current board member, underreported Mr. Ghosn's compensation between 2011 and 2015 by more than 5 billion yen ($44.5 million). The prosecutors say they declared pay of just under Â¥5 billion ($44.3 million), which was half the nearly Â¥10 billion ($88.8 million) he actually earned.
Neither man has been charged. Prosecutors have 72 hours to assess the accusations, and they can request an additional 20 days, depending on court approval, to investigate.
Nissan's board will meet Thursday to consider their removal.
For an executive long lionized in business circles and celebrated by employees, the arrest was a shocking comeuppance. Mr. Ghosn, 64, is credited with turning around two carmakers, Renault and Nissan, and engineering an alliance -- with those two companies and then Mitsubishi -- that pioneered sharing technologies and cost savings. His life has been chronicled in manga comic books in Japan. He carried the Olympic torch before the 2016 Summer Games in Brazil. At Nissan factories, autograph-seeking employees swarmed him.
He was named one of the most powerful people in business by Fortune magazine in 2003. He became a fixture on the conference circuit and a regular at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
Mr. Ghosn kept homes in Paris, Amsterdam, Beirut and Rio de Janeiro; shuttled around the globe on a corporate jet; and dined with heads of state. He collected contemporary art, invested in wineries and, in 2016, rented out Versailles to celebrate his wedding to his second wife, Carole, along with her 50th birthday. The party was inspired by Sofia Coppola's film "Marie Antoinette."
By the time prosecutors boarded his corporate jet on Monday at Haneda Airport in Tokyo to take him off for questioning, Mr. Ghosn had been embroiled in several fights over executive pay, something of a recurring subplot in his career. He has made many millions of dollars serving as chief executive and chairman of Nissan, Renault and Mitsubishi Motors. At times, his pay drew the ire of investors and politicians, including Emmanuel Macron, now the French president, when he was finance minister in 2016.
"He was always arguing about whether he was adequately compensated," said Robin Ferracone, founder of Farient Advisors, an executive compensation advisory firm. "The question was whether he should be compared to Japanese standards, or international standards or American standards."
In Japan, Mr. Ghosn's pay far outstripped those of his counterparts. As chairman of Nissan last year, he reported income of Â¥735 million, more than four times the pay of Toyota's chairman.
"There was always a disconnect between Western management salaries and Japanese management salaries," said Christopher Richter, deputy head of Japan research at CLSA, an investment and brokerage group. Even though "compared to executives in other countries, some people would regard him as underpaid," Mr. Richter added, "I guess you could say there was something of a culture clash in that."
Mr. Ghosn was unrepentant about his pay and engaging when discussing his achievements. When The Financial Times this year asked him if he was paid too much, he laughed. "You won't have any C.E.O. say, 'I'm overly compensated,"' he said.
Mr. Ghosn was born in Brazil to Lebanese immigrants and moved to Beirut when he was a toddler.
He went on to study engineering at an elite university in Paris, then worked at Michelin, the tire maker, for 18 years.
He started on the factory floor, preparing rubber for the manufacturing process. Soon he was a plant manager. Before long he was deployed to his native Brazil as chief operating officer of Michelin's local subsidiary, where he expanded the business despite soaring inflation. In 1990 he was made chief executive for Michelin's troubled North American division, and he revived it.
But Michelin was a family company, and Mr. Ghosn said he knew he was unlikely to become C.E.O. When Renault, the French carmaker, recruited him in 1996, he joined as the executive vice president overseeing manufacturing, purchasing, and research and development.
At the time, Renault was reeling after a failed merger with Volvo, and Mr. Ghosn focused on improving margins by slashing costs. His aggressive approach earned him the nickname "Le Cost Killer." Mr. Ghosn didn't particularly like the moniker, but he recently acknowledged its resonance. "It's sexy," he said this year. "There's blood in it, there's meanness."
After Renault acquired a large stake in Nissan in 1999, Mr. Ghosn was sent to Japan to become chief operating officer. In a country that values hierarchy and protocol, Mr. Ghosn did away with much of the customary formality. He was seen walking the floor, shaking hands with junior staff members and bringing upper management and lower-level employees together in meetings.
Mr. Ghosn's inviting gestures went only so far. Six months into his tenure, on the eve of the Tokyo Motor Show, he presented a plan for Nissan's revival. Billed the Nissan Revival Plan, it called for the elimination of some 21,000 jobs, or 14 percent of the work force, including several top managers.
A series of manga comics, published in 2002, depicted the moment when Mr. Ghosn unveiled the restructuring plan to Nissan's executive team. The illustrations showed colleagues sweating about the news to close factories.
"Right now Nissan is just like a boat that is on fire and we need to extinguish this fire as soon as possible," the cartoon Mr. Ghosn says.
In a country where layoffs are rare, Mr. Ghosn was pilloried in the press and labeled a "gaijin," or foreigner. In a measure of his own confidence, Mr. Ghosn pledged to step down if his plan failed.
The aggressive cost-cutting worked. Within a year, Nissan's finances had stabilized. Soon after, its debt load was slashed and its profits had improved. Mr. Ghosn was named chief executive in 2001.
The next year, he took Nissan into China with a venture with Dongfeng Motor and revived sports car models like the Z and the GT-R.
But by the mid-2000s, the turnaround stalled, leading some critics to question whether Mr. Ghosn's management magic had faded. In 2006, he pursued a partnership with General Motors in the United States, but G.M. eventually ended the talks.
The recession of 2008 forced Mr. Ghosn to institute wide-ranging belt-tightening across the company, including new parts orders and factory overtime, and even the activities of the corporate-sponsored baseball team. Managers took a 5 percent pay cut.
One investment that Mr. Ghosn continued to pursue was the development of battery-powered cars. Profitability might still be elusive, but the alliance saw the models -- Renault, with its subcompact Zoe, and Nissan, with its compact Leaf -- as necessary innovations.
There was little sign that Mr. Ghosn was slowing down -- or less eager for calculated risk-taking. In 2016, he helped to orchestrate Nissan's deal for a 34 percent stake in Mitsubishi, bailing out the company after it was caught falsifying fuel economy estimates. He drew the smaller carmaker into the alliance with Renault and Nissan -- and Mr. Ghosn became chairman of Mitsubishi, earning him a third salary.
On Monday, Mitsubishi, like Nissan, said it would recommend that Mr. Ghosn be removed as chairman. In France, where Renault employs 47,000 workers, there was a more cautious response. The finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, said on Tuesday that Mr. Ghosn was "no longer in a position capable of leading Renault" because of the inquiry, but France has seen no evidence of the crimes alleged in Japan.
Mr. Ghosn had planned to spend Tuesday night far differently. According to Jun Miyaji, a manager at Kushiwaka, a restaurant serving skewered chicken, Mr. Ghosn's secretary called to cancel his 7:30 reservation for dinner.

Macy's Raises Forecast Before Shopping Season
Macy's raised its annual earnings forecast on Wednesday, signaling a strong holiday shopping season ahead, encouraged by good performance at its stores and its growing online business.
The department store chain, the largest in the United States, also reported much better than expected profit and sales for the third quarter, boosted by double-digit growth at its online shop.
Like many other major American retail names, Macy's has been struggling with plummeting mall traffic and a defection of customers to a new range of online and fast-fashion stores. It has closed more than 100 locations and cut thousands of jobs since 2015.
In response, the 160-year old company has invested heavily in its off-price Backstage stores, loyalty program, mobile app and website, while improving brick-and-mortar stores by equipping them with mobile checkouts and new shop layouts. REUTERS
ECONOMY
Consumer Prices Tick Higher in October
Consumer prices climbed 0.3 percent in October, with higher prices for gasoline, used autos and housing contributing to the increase.
The Labor Department said Wednesday that this measure of inflation has jumped 2.5 percent over the past 12 months. Adjusted for rising prices, average weekly wages have improved 0.9 percent this year. That is an increase of $8.52 in weekly earnings from October 2017.
The Federal Reserve targets inflation at 2 percent, just enough to encourage consumer spending and economic growth without leading to price increases that could destabilize the economy.
Fed officials are expected at an upcoming meeting in December to raise a key short-term interest rate for the fourth time this year, in hopes of keeping inflation in check and preventing economic growth from overheating in ways that could trigger a downturn.
But inflation could be tamer in future months because oil prices have been trending lower and the value of the dollar has strengthened.
Core inflation, which excludes volatile energy and food costs, rose 0.2 percent in October. This core figure, which many economists consider to be a better indicator of underlying inflation, has risen 2.1 percent from a year ago.
Gas prices increased 3 percent in October, after having dipped 0.2 percent in September. A.P.
MANUFACTURING
Volkswagen to Convert Plants for Electric Cars
Volkswagen will convert three German factories to build electric cars, as Europe's largest automaker by sales starts mass producing zero-emission vehicles in a major strategy shift following its emissions cheating scandal.
The German company said on Wednesday its plant in Emden, which currently builds the VW Passat, would build electric cars from 2022 onward, while its factory in Hannover would start making them the same year.
The Hanover plant will maintain some production of combustion-engine vehicles in addition to building battery driven cars, VW said.
"We are moving at full speed into the production of electric vehicles. Emden and Hanover are to be further model plants in Germany. Together with Zwickau, they will form the largest network for the production of electric vehicles in Europe," Gunnar Kilian, VW board member responsible for personnel, said.
VW will spend 1.2 billion euros ($1.4 billion) training workers at Zwickau, it said.
The Zwickau plant in eastern Germany will start building electric cars for three of the group's in-house brands from late 2019, VW added. REUTERS

U.S. Military Advantage Has Diminished, a Congressional Panel Finds

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Pentagon's new focus on threats from China and Russia after almost two decades of fighting terrorism "too often rests on questionable assumptions and weak analysis," an independent bipartisan commission concluded in a sharply critical report issued on Wednesday that challenges President Trump's commitment to supporting a strong military.
Over all, the panel that was appointed last year by Congress praised the general direction of the National Defense Strategy that was issued in January by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis.
But it warned that projected budget shortfalls, overtaxed military forces around the globe and other risks were imperiling the plan, just as it was taking effect.
"America's longstanding military advantages have diminished," according to the wide-ranging, 90-page report, an advance copy of which was made available to The New York Times. "The country's strategic margin for error has become distressingly small. Doubts about America's ability to deter and, if necessary, defeat opponents and honor its global commitments have proliferated."
While the defense strategy "represents a constructive first step in responding to this crisis," the report found, "it does not adequately explain how we should get there."
The National Defense Strategy represents a shift from fighting the insurgent wars of the last 17 years to large state-on-state conflicts. Mr. Trump has voiced a desire to end American involvement in the war in Afghanistan, and has chafed at keeping forces in Iraq and Syria.
Specifically, the strategy puts a higher priority on confronting China and Russia, as well as North Korea and Iran -- a complex set of new and emerging threats.
Wednesday's report said China and Russia were seeking regional hegemony and pursuing aggressive military buildups aimed at neutralizing American strengths. Additionally, it said, threats posed by Iran and North Korea have worsened in recent years as both have developed more advanced weapons.
Those rivals and others, the report found, are also increasingly engaged in what the military calls "gray-zone conflicts" -- actions short of all-out war but that include diplomatic and economic coercion, media manipulation and cyberattacks, and the use of paramilitaries and proxy forces.
The commission also cited "political dysfunction" in the United States, as well as reductions in military spending imposed by budget caps. The report said both have restrained the government from keeping pace with threats in what the panel called "a crisis of national security."
The report's sober warnings come as Mr. Trump has ordered the Pentagon to cut 5 percent from its proposed 2020 fiscal year budget -- to about $700 billion from roughly $733 billion. Representative Adam Smith, Democrat of Washington and most likely the next chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, has signaled that he favors even deeper cuts in military spending.
A Pentagon spokesman, Johnny Michael, said the department welcomed the panel's report and would carefully consider its recommendations.
"The commission's description of the complexity of the current security environment -- in which strategic competition is occurring across domains and rapid technological developments are changing the character of warfare -- is also a stark reminder of the gravity of these issues, and a call to action," Mr. Michael said in a statement.
The 12-member panel, formally known as the Commission on the National Defense Strategy for the United States, was created as part of the 2017 fiscal year defense budget to review the Pentagon's new plan even before Mr. Mattis released it. The panel is led by Eric S. Edelman, a former top Pentagon policy official in President George W. Bush's administration, and Adm. Gary Roughead, a former chief of naval operations.
Over the past two decades, while the Pentagon mainly focused on counterterrorism and counterinsurgency, the report found that foreign adversaries were studying the American military. As a result, they developed ways to counter longstanding American advantages in projecting power over distances, air and missile defense, cyberoperations and electronic warfare.
"In some cases, we are behind, or falling behind, in critical technologies," the report said. "U.S. competitors are making enormous investments in hypersonic delivery vehicles, artificial intelligence and other advanced technologies."
In the event of large-scale conflict with Russia or China, the United States may not have enough remaining forces to deter other adversaries "in one -- let alone two -- other theaters" without having to rely on nuclear weapons, the report said.
"Many of the skills necessary to plan for and conduct military operations against capable adversaries -- especially China and Russia -- have atrophied," the report said.
To counter China in the western Pacific, the commission called for investing in more long-range military transport planes as well as submarines and other undersea warfare equipment. To counter Russia, the report recommended continuing a NATO buildup on the alliance's eastern flank and the Baltics that has been underway for several years.
It also warned against large troop reductions in the Middle East, where the United States' economic and security interests "will be profound."
The report applauded the Pentagon's strategy for aggressively pursuing technological innovations and fielding those advances with forces deployed around the world.
However, it expressed concern "that America's edge is diminishing or has disappeared in many key technologies that underpin U.S. military superiority, and that current efforts to offset that decline are insufficient."
The report offered no specific suggestions about how much the military should spend to achieve these goals, other than to recommend an average budget increase of 3 percent to 5 percent above inflation.
"Available resources are clearly insufficient to fulfill the strategy's ambitious goals," it said, including assurances that the Pentagon "can defeat a major-power adversary while deterring other enemies simultaneously."
Additionally -- and notably -- commission members took the unusual step of warning that the voices of senior civilian officials in the Defense Department "have been relatively muted" on pivotal defense and national security policy.
By the end of the Obama administration, many senior Pentagon civilians were grumbling that the military's Joint Staff, reporting to Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was exercising too much influence over policy matters and subtly, though not deliberately, undermining the bedrock principle of civilian control of the armed forces.
"It is critical that D.O.D. -- and Congress -- reverse the unhealthy trend in which decision-making is drifting away from civilian leaders on issues of national importance," the report said.
In a telephone interview, Mr. Edelman, a former top aide to Vice President Dick Cheney and a former United States ambassador to Turkey, said he and Admiral Roughead had met with Mr. Mattis in May to describe their conclusions, and that the secretary found them helpful.
Mr. Mattis could use the commission's report "as a cudgel" to prod the vast and often unwieldy Pentagon bureaucracy to respond to the panel's findings, Mr. Edelman said.
Or, as the report put it, "If we do not square up to the challenge now, we will surely regret it."

Full text: WASHINGTON -- President Trump's promise to quickly pass a revamped North American Free Trade Agreement has been upended by the midterm elections, with Democrats who will soon control the House vowing to withhold their support to extract greater protections for American workers.
Administration officials remain confident they will corral the votes for the new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which Mr. Trump speedily negotiated in September to claim a big win on one of his signature issues before the November elections.
While White House officials considered pushing the revised deal through the coming lame-duck session, they did not want to risk a backlash from lawmakers in both parties.
Democrats, emboldened by their midterm win and eager to outshine Mr. Trump as defenders of the American worker, are unlikely to sign off on any deal that does not include significant changes that labor leaders and newly elected progressives are demanding. That could involve reopening negotiations with Mexico, although American and Mexican negotiators have both publicly ruled out that possibility.
"Trump made it seem like this was a done deal, but there is a long, long way to go," said Representative Bill Pascrell, a New Jersey Democrat who is likely to be named chairman of the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Trade.
The House will consider the agreement first under the Constitution's provision mandating that revenue bills originate in the lower chamber. A vote could take up to nine months or longer, according to senior administration officials.
House Democrats are particularly concerned about a provision that would require at least 30 percent of the labor used to build each car in Mexico to be completed by workers earning at least $16 an hour. That amount will rise to 40 percent by 2023 but the $16 wage is not indexed to inflation, meaning the increase will be diluted over time as prices rise.
The text of the agreement also requires Mexico to make it easier for workers to join unions.
All of these actions were intended to make it less likely that automakers and other manufacturers would shift American jobs south for cheaper labor. But Democrats and their allies in manufacturing unions -- who have remained neutral on the proposed pact -- maintain that the new requirements, while an improvement on the original Nafta, do not go far enough.
They are demanding more specifics about how the deal will be enforced, and raising questions about whether the $16-an-hour benchmark for Mexican workers -- which is about four times the typical wage for Mexican autoworkers -- is high enough to stanch the flow of American jobs to Mexico.
"Without enforcement you don't have anything. Without it, you are, shall we say, just rebranding Nafta," Representative Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, said last week, days before voters swept her party back into power.
"Right now, it is a work in progress," said Mrs. Pelosi, a former speaker who is expected to reclaim that post. "Mexico has to pass a law about labor rights in Mexico, so that has not happened yet and that is a predicate of this agreement. Most important of all are the enforcement provisions in terms of labor and the environment. Enforcement, enforcement, enforcement."
The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, and House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, have both said publicly that they will not take up the agreement this year, although several free-trade proponents in their own party, led by Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania, are urging them to reconsider.
Mr. Toomey has his own reservations about the deal -- he believes it includes too many potential restrictions on free trade -- but he warned his fellow Republicans that entering a protracted negotiation with Democrats would be a losing strategy.
"I would be shocked -- shocked -- to learn that Nancy Pelosi is going to make passing new Nafta, which would be a big win for the president, her top priority," he said.
Robert E. Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, has repeatedly assured Mr. Trump that he will be able to sell the deal to Democrats and the leaders of the United Steelworkers Union, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and the United Autoworkers Union, according to current and former White House officials.
"We are very confident that Congress will approve U.S.M.C.A.," said Jeff Emerson, a spokesman for the United States trade representative, referring to the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.

"From the beginning, Ambassador Lighthizer has worked closely with Democrats and Republicans in the House and Senate on the renegotiation of this agreement," he said, adding that the pact "is a balanced deal with strong provisions that will benefit U.S. businesses and workers and that enjoys broad support among key stakeholders."
But there are signs that Mr. Lighthizer, who has a close working relationship with many labor leaders and pro-union Democrats like Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, may have a tougher time than he anticipated.
"Words on a paper won't stop jobs from going to Mexico, unless there's real teeth behind them," Mr. Brown said.
In late October, Leo Gerard, the president of the United Steelworkers Union and chairman of the United States trade representative's labor advisory council, reviewed the preliminary text of the deal and concluded that the new agreement contained provisions that "undermine the interests of workers and consumers" while doing too little to "curtail the illegal suppression of wages in Mexico," according to a letter sent to Mr. Lighthizer.
In the letter, Mr. Gerard took issue with the administration's decision to maintain steel and aluminum tariffs against Canada and questioned the effectiveness of the agreement's proposed automotive rules of origin intended to increase the percentage of cars built by American workers.
But he saved his sharpest criticism for the Mexican wage provisions, arguing that the $16 hour average wage mandated in the deal "is arguably too low to make a significant difference" in persuading manufacturers to keep their plants in the United States. He suggested making the wage standard a minimum, rather than an average, and suggested indexing it to inflation to ensure that the wage increases aren't "meaningless."
AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador, a populist who was elected president of Mexico in July, supports wage increases but it is unclear if he can pass sweeping labor reforms through the country's legislature.
During a private meeting with House members of both parties last month, Mr. Lighthizer conceded that the labor provisions needed to be strengthened, but he declined to reopen talks with Mexico, according to three people who attended the meeting.
The Nafta vote will be up or down, and Congress cannot amend the text, according to the rules governing fast-track trade agreements. But negotiators from each country are free to negotiate potential changes to secure enough votes for passage in their respective chambers.
Mexican officials have said the labor standards in the deal are sufficient. Mr. Emerson said Mr. Lighthizer rejected as "false" the idea that he would consider reopening the deal. The labor standards included in the deal, he added, "are ambitious and enforceable," he said.
But Representative Sander Levin, a Michigan Democrat who attended the meeting last month, called the provision "a major flaw" and said "there will have to be some attempt to discuss this with Mexico" in order for the deal to win Democratic backing.
Mr. Lighthizer remains eager to conclude a deal as quickly as possible, people close to him said, so he can focus on China, whose trade practices he sees as a far bigger threat to American workers than Nafta, which has helped stitch together the economies of Mexico, Canada and the United States.
But there's one tactic he refuses to use to break the logjam: withdrawing from Nafta as a means of pressuring legislators to act quickly.
Mr. Trump has raised the possibility repeatedly since being elected, but has been talked out of it by Mr. Lighthizer and other advisers, most recently the National Economic Council director, Larry Kudlow, according to a senior administration official with knowledge of the situation.

Full text: The $1.5 trillion tax overhaul that President Trump signed into law late last year has already given the American economy a jolt, at least temporarily. It has fattened the paychecks of most American workers, padded the profits of large corporations and sped economic growth.
Those results weren't a surprise. Economists across the ideological spectrum predicted the new law would fuel consumer spending, in classic fashion: When the government borrows money and dumps it into the economy, growth tends to accelerate. But Republicans did not sell the law as a sugar-high stimulus. They sold it as a refashioning of the incentives in the American economy -- one that would unleash more investment, better efficiency and higher wages, along with enough growth to offset any revenue lost to the government from lower tax rates.
Ten months after the law took effect, that promised "supply-side" bump is harder to find than the sugar-high stimulus. It's still early, but here's what the numbers tell us so far:
The Investment Bump
Proponents of the tax overhaul said it would supercharge the recent lackluster pace of business spending on long-term investments like buildings, factories, equipment and technology.
Such spending is crucial to keeping economic growth strong. And strong growth is central to Republican claims that the tax cuts would ultimately pay for themselves.
Capital spending did pick up steam earlier this year. For companies in the S&P 500, capital expenditures rose roughly 20 percent in the first half of 2018. Much of that was concentrated: The spending of just five companies -- Google's parent, Alphabet, and Facebook, Intel, Exxon Mobil and Goldman Sachs -- accounted for roughly a third of the entire rise. Much of that spending went toward technology, including increased investment in data centers and computing, server and networking capacity.
For the full year, Goldman Sachs analysts expect that capital expenditures for companies in the S&P 500 will be up about 14 percent, to $715 billion. Research and development spending, another component of business investment, was expected to be up 12 percent, to $340 billion.
For the economy as a whole, the surge in business investment was a bit less impressive. It's true that business spending on fixed investment -- such as machinery, buildings and equipment -- rose, jumping 11.5 percent and 8.7 percent during the first and second quarters. The first-quarter jump was the fastest for investment since 2011.
But that pace fizzled during the third quarter. Recently data showed third-quarter business investment rose at an annual pace of 0.8 percent. The last quarter of the year -- traditionally a big one for capital spending -- will fill out the picture, but that data won't be released until early 2019.
It will likely take years to get a better sense of whether the law fundamentally reshaped American corporate investment. But there's little clear evidence that it is drastically reshaping the way in which most companies invest and spend.
The results of a survey published in late October by the National Association for Business Economics showed that 81 percent of the 116 companies surveyed said they had not changed plans for investment or hiring because of the tax bill.
The Buyback Binge
Cheerleaders for the tax cut argued that the heart of the law -- cutting and restructuring taxes for corporations -- would give the economy a positive bump, giving companies incentives to invest more, hire more workers and pay higher wages.
Skeptics said that the money companies saved through tax cuts would merely increase corporate profits, rather than trickling down to workers.
JPMorgan Chase analysts estimate that in the first half of 2018, about $270 billion in corporate profits previously held overseas were repatriated to the United States and spent as a result of changes to the tax code. Some 46 percent of that, JPMorgan Chase analysts said, was spent on $124 billion in stock buybacks.
The flow of repatriated corporate cash is just one tributary in what has become a flood of payouts to shareholders, both as buybacks and dividends. Such payouts are expected to hit almost $1.3 trillion this year, up 28 percent from 2017, according to estimates from Goldman Sachs analysts.
Debts and Deficits
Supporters of the tax cuts repeatedly claimed the bill would increase economic growth enough to offset the decline in tax receipts. "I'm totally convinced this is a revenue-neutral bill," said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, when a preliminary version of the bill was approved in the Senate in December 2017.
Despite a remarkably strong economy, the fiscal health of the United States is deteriorating fast, as revenues have declined sharply. The federal budget deficit -- the gap between what the government collects in revenues and what it spends -- rose to $779 billion in the 2018 fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30. That was a 17 percent increase from the prior year.
It's highly unusual for deficits and borrowing needs to grow this much during periods of prosperity. A broad variety of analysts attribute the widening deficit to the tax cuts (along with increased military and other domestic spending ushered in through a bill Mr. Trump signed earlier this year).
Corporate tax revenues are down one-third from a year ago. Federal revenues as a whole ran $200 billion behind the Congressional Budget Office's forecast for the 2018 fiscal year -- even though economic growth was faster than the C.B.O. expected. The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget reports that nominal federal revenues are down by at least 3.6 percent since the tax cuts took effect.
The growing budget gap means the Treasury must borrow more to keep the government running. The Treasury expects to borrow a total of $1.338 trillion from global investors this calendar year. That would be 145 percent higher than the $546 billion the federal government borrowed last year. That would be the highest level of borrowing since 2010, when the American economy was struggling to recover from the great recession.
Bonus Announcements
Shortly after the tax law passed, hundreds of companies -- from large multinationals to small manufacturers -- announced that they would be using some of their windfall from the law to give one-time bonuses to employees. Others said they would raise minimum wages across the company, or expand worker benefits.
Mr. Trump and Republicans hailed those announcements as evidence that the law's benefits were flowing substantially to workers. Americans for Tax Reform compiled a list of 750 companies, and growing, that said they would pass tax savings on to workers in some form.
Data from large public companies, however, suggest that most workers received relatively small shares of their employers' corporate tax savings.
The nonprofit research group Just Capital, which is tracking 1,000 large public companies' reports of how they are spending their tax cuts, calculates that the typical worker at one of those large companies has received about $225 this year in increased salary, a one-time bonus, or both, attributable to the new law.
Workers for those companies were more likely to see their wages rise if they lived in states where the minimum wage was relatively low -- and where companies do not have to pay workers more to compensate for high housing costs. California workers at those companies saw an average benefit of about $160 each, which is less than half the average benefit for workers in Kentucky.
Many companies also said they would use tax savings to create jobs. But the Just Capital research finds that, since the tax cuts were passed, the 1,000 largest public companies have actually reduced employment, on balance. They have announced the elimination of nearly 140,000 jobs -- which is almost double the 73,000 jobs they say they have created in that time. About half of those net losses came from companies in the restaurant and leisure industries, the analysis found.
The Wage Story
Nearly a year after the cuts were signed into law, wage growth has yet to pick up when accounting for inflation. In September, the Labor Department reported that inflation-adjusted wages had risen 0.5 percent from the year before. That's a slower rate of growth than the economy itself experienced in September 2017, when it was 0.6 percent.
Growth has accelerated in nominal terms. Median wage growth was 3.5 percent in September, according to calculations by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, up from 3 percent in January, but still below its recent highs in 2016. Growth in the Employment Cost Index rose from 2.9 percent at the end of 2017 to 3 percent in the third quarter.
By Republicans' own economic theories, it should take a while for corporate tax cuts to translate into higher worker pay. First, the cuts need to stimulate increased capital investments, which in turn raise worker productivity. More productive workers would then see their wages rise accordingly.
Productivity grew 3 percent in the second quarter of this year and 2.2 percent in the third -- healthy numbers, which will need to continue apace to deliver the sort of long-term economic jolt Republicans promised.

Full text: LOS ANGELES -- The Grinch, 61 years old, may be "as cuddly as a cactus" and "as charming as an eel," to quote his creator. But slather him with high-fructose corn syrup (perky computer animation), roll him in a mega-marketing campaign (10 million Grinch-themed boxes shipped by Amazon alone), and the green critter is as sure a bet as there is in mass holiday entertainment.
"Dr. Seuss' The Grinch," based on the 1957 book "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" -- and following in the Whoville-hating footsteps of the classic TV special, a stage musical, and a live-action film starring Jim Carrey -- arrived in 4,141 theaters in North America over the weekend and took in a strong $66 million. The new film, with Benedict Cumberbatch leading the voice cast, cost Illumination Entertainment about $75 million to make and was distributed by Universal Pictures.
"Christmas came early this year," the studio said in a statement on Sunday. "The Grinch," marketed with Grinchy ads that poked fun at itself ("Another remake?! Hope you're proud Hollywood"), took in an additional $12.7 million from 23 overseas markets, according to Universal.
[Read the New York Times review of "The Grinch"]
Domestic ticket sales for the movie were on par with those for the first installment in Illumination's blockbuster "Despicable Me" franchise. The first "Despicable Me" collected $56.4 million over its first three days in July 2010, or $66 million based on today's ticket prices. But "The Grinch" fell behind Illumination's "Dr. Seuss' The Lorax," which arrived to $78.2 million in ticket sales in March 2012, after adjusting for inflation.
Second place for the weekend went to the surprise smash hit "Bohemian Rhapsody" (20th Century Fox), which took in an estimated $30.9 million for a two-week domestic total of $100 million, according to Comscore, which compiles box-office data. Turnout overseas has been equally astonishing: "Bohemian Rhapsody," a musical biopic about Queen and its flamboyant frontman, Freddie Mercury, has collected an additional $185 million outside of the United States and Canada.
"Bohemian Rhapsody" has sparked renewed interest in Queen songs, benefiting an unusual owner of the music: Disney, which bought rights to the Queen catalog almost 30 years ago for its little-known Hollywood Records division.
Aside from "The Grinch," it was not a great weekend for new wide-release movies. "Overlord" (Paramount), a World War II horror thriller from a producing team that included J.J. Abrams, arrived to about $10.1 million in ticket sales, on the low end of prerelease expectations. "Overlord," which cost $38 million to make and tens of millions more to market, collected an additional $9.2 million in extensive release overseas.
"The Nutcracker and the Four Realms" (Disney) was fourth, taking in $9.6 million for a two-week domestic total of $35.3 million.
Rounding out the top five was "The Girl in the Spider's Web," which fizzled with about $8 million in ticket sales. Poor reviews likely held back "Spider's Web," an R-rated thriller based on the best-selling novel of the same name. The film cost Sony, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and New Regency roughly $43 million to make, not including marketing. Overseas, "Spider's Web," directed by Fede Alvarez, has collected $8.3 million.
On the plus side for Sony: "Venom," based on one of the lesser-known superheroes in Sony's stable, rolled out in China and took in a jaw-dropping $111 million, far surpassing opening-weekend totals for recent Marvel movies. Worldwide ticket sales for "Venom" now stand at $674 million.

Rohrabacher Is Defeated In California After 30 Years

Full text: Representative Dana Rohrabacher, a Republican fixture in California who represented Orange County for 15 terms, has lost his bid for re-election. His defeat underlines the party's setbacks in a part of the state that was long a symbol of its political dominance.
The Associated Press called the race on Saturday, with Harley Rouda receiving 52 percent of the vote to Mr. Rohrabacher's 48 percent.
Mr. Rouda, 56, is a former Republican turned Democrat who became a symbol of the Democratic efforts to win back Congress this year. Mr. Rohrabacher, 71, was viewed as particularly vulnerable because he defended Russia in the midst of allegations about its efforts to intervene in elections in the United States.
In July, Mr. Rohrabacher admitted to meeting with Maria Butina, who was charged by federal prosecutors this summer with conspiracy and acting as a foreign agent, during his trip to Russia in 2015. Mr. Rohrabacher was considered so valuable to the Kremlin that the F.B.I. warned him in 2012 that Russia regarded him as an intelligence source worthy of a code name. His support for President Vladimir Putin of Russia raised questions even among fellow Republicans.
Mr. Rouda capitalized on that in his campaign, running ads emphasizing Mr. Rohrabacher's Putin ties and criticizing Mr. Rohrabacher for questioning the assertion by United States intelligence agencies that Russia interfered in the 2016 election.
Mr. Rouda has said he is in favor of Medicare for All and a $15-an-hour federal minimum wage tied to inflation, along with free tuition at public colleges. In a post on Twitter after the race was called, he thanked his supporters "who dedicated countless hours to flipping" the 48th Congressional District. He told The Associated Press that he intended to be "honest, transparent, accessible and tireless" in Washington.
Democrats have focused on seven seats in California that were controlled by Republicans. The loss by Mr. Rohrabacher marks the third Democratic victory in those races.
On Saturday night, three other races remained too close to call.
Josh Harder, a Democrat, was ahead of Representative Jeff Denham by 1.9 percentage points in the 10th District. Representative Mimi Walters, a Republican, was leading Katie Porter by 0.9 percentage point in the 45th District. And Young Kim, a Republican, was beating Gil Cisneros by 1.4 percentage points in a race to replace Representative Ed Royce, a Republican who is retiring from the 39th District seat.
Support for Republicans has been steadily eroding in Orange County; in 2016, Hillary Clinton became the first Democratic presidential candidate to win there since the Great Depression. Roughly a third of voters in the county are registered Republicans, down from more than half in 1990. About 30 percent of voters in the district are not registered with either party.

Oil Prices Sink Again and Enter Bear Market as Postelection Surge Fades

Full text: Stocks in the United States slipped Thursday as the ninth consecutive drop in crude oil prices hurt energy companies. Markets were coming off huge gains the day before.
United States crude oil has now slumped more than 20 percent since early October, meeting Wall Street's definition of a "bear market."
Government fuel stockpiles have steadily expanded, pushing supplies higher, and the United States issued waivers to a number of countries that buy oil from Iran. That allows those countries to keep importing Iranian oil in spite of renewed sanctions on that country.
Most other groups of stocks finished little changed. Banks made the largest gains. The Federal Reserve left interest rates where they are, but suggested it plans to keep raising rates in response to the strong United States economy.
After its steep plunge in October, the S&P 500 had risen for six of the seven days ending on Wednesday. Stocks started sinking last month because investors worried that the Fed was going to raise interest rates to the point they slowed down economic growth. But John Lynch, chief investment strategist at LPL Research, said he does not think that is going to happen and that the Fed will stop raising rates in 2019.
"We do not believe they will be as aggressive as many fear," he said. "We still don't have anything approaching the wage pressures that have historically scared the Fed."
The S&P 500 index shed 7.06 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,806.83 after it jumped 2.1 percent Wednesday. The Dow Jones industrial average inched up 10.92 points to 26,191.22. The Nasdaq composite dipped 39.87 points, or 0.5 percent, to 7,530.89 after a 2.6 percent surge a day earlier.
Benchmark United States crude oil fell 1.6 percent to $60.67 a barrel in New York. On Oct. 3 it closed at $76.41, the highest level in almost four years.
Brent crude lost $1.00 to $60.67 a barrel in London. Brent crude is the standard for international oil prices and it has also fallen sharply over the last five weeks.
Exxon Mobil fell 1.6 percent to $81.71 and ConocoPhillips gave up 4.5 percent to $119.36.
Bond prices held steady. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was unchanged at 3.24 percent, near its highest level this year. The Federal Reserve left interest rates where they are, but suggested it plans to keep raising them in response to the strong United States economy. The Fed has raised its key rate eight times since late 2015 and is expected to do so again in December, with several more increases to follow.
Bank of America rose 1.2 percent to $28.87 and M&T Bank added 1.2 percent to $167.37.
The Fed has been raising rates to prevent inflation from getting out of hand. Mr. Lynch, of LPL, said that inflation is not going to get much stronger because wages are not going to grow much faster than they currently are. He said factors like the retirement of more baby boomers, global competition and slower economic growth in the United States will all limit increases in pay.
Chip-maker Qualcomm had a strong fourth quarter, but for the current period it is projecting revenue of $4.5 billion to $5.3 billion, far below the $5.6 billion analysts expected, according to FactSet. Its stock lost 8.2 percent to $58.05.
Apple stopped making royalty payments to Qualcomm following a dispute between the companies, and later decided to stop using Qualcomm modems in some of its products. Qualcomm said both of those changes have hurt its results.
D.R. Horton, one of the largest homebuilders, fell 9 percent to $34.22 after its earnings and sales fell short of Wall Street forecasts. The company said rising home prices and mortgage rates are affecting demand. That exact combination has been weighing on home sales and the stocks all year. PulteGroup fell 3.5 percent to $24.23 and Lennar lost 2.5 percent to $41.90.
Wynn Resorts dropped 13.1 percent to $99.02 after the casino operator said its business in Macau has slowed down recently.
Stocks climbed Wednesday after the midterm elections generally went the way investors thought they would. The Democrats took control of the House of Representatives while the Republicans held on to a majority in the Senate. That means that politics appears that much less likely to crowd out the performance of the strong United States economy.
In other commodities trading, wholesale gasoline was little changed at $1.64 a gallon. Heating oil dropped 3.1 percent to $2.17 a gallon. Natural gas edged down to $3.54 per 1,000 cubic feet.
Gold fell $3.30 to $1,222.90 an ounce. Silver lost 1 percent to $14.42 an ounce. Copper slipped 0.7 percent to $2.74 a pound.
The dollar rose to 113.96 yen from 113.34 yen. The euro fell to $1.1359 from $1.1437.

Full text: U.S. stocks rose Tuesday as industrial and technology companies recovered some of the big losses they took over the last month. Strong company earnings also contributed to the gains, but stocks stayed calm as traders waited for results from the midterm elections in the U.S.
Industrial and basic materials companies made some of the biggest gains following reports from fertilizer maker Mosaic and granite, limestone, sand and gravel seller Martin Marietta Materials. Bond prices dipped, sending yields higher. Oil prices continued to fall, extending four weeks of losses. British stocks fell as negotiators from the U.K. and European Union as remained deadlocked over the issue of Ireland's borders.
The midterm elections will determine control of the House of Representatives and Senate, and 36 governorships are being contested along with other state and local positions. The vote could affect U.S. trade, economic and security policies.
Alicia Levine, chief market strategist at BNY Mellon Investment Management, said some of the most dramatic reactions to the elections might be seen in the health care sector, as Republicans could make another attempt to eliminate the 2010 Affordable Care Act if they keep control of the House and Senate.
"If the Democrats take the House, the Affordable Care Act is not under threat of being repealed," she said, which could help health insurers and hospitals. "If we see the Democrats take the governors houses, you could also see the expansion of Medicaid."
A Democratic House majority might work with the administration to try to reduce drug prices, and would take a more lenient approach on food stamp benefits. That could help big box stores and grocery chains, which get a lot of revenue from those programs.
If Republicans keep control of the House, Levine said, they might index capital gains taxes to inflation, which would effectively cut those taxes. While that could boost the economy, it would also encourage the Federal Reserve to keep raising interest rates at a faster pace, and investors are already concerned that rates could rise too fast.
The S&P 500 index rose 17.14 points, or 0.6 percent, to 2,755.45. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 173.31 points, or 0.7 percent, to 25,635.01. The Nasdaq composite picked up 47.11 points, or 0.6 percent, to 7,375.96. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks added 8.59 points, or 0.6 percent, to 1,556.10.
Stocks dropped in October and recovered a sliver of their gains during a three-day rally last week. They made smaller moves over the final few days before the polls closed. Stocks tend to fall before midterm elections and then rally once the voting is over. The S&P 500 has generated an average price return of 16.7 percent in the 12 months after midterm elections since 1946, according to CFRA.
Drugstore and pharmacy benefits manager CVS Health rose 5.7 percent to $77.90 after its results topped Wall Street forecasts in the third quarter. It was helped by a large bump in prescriptions. CVS also said it expects to complete its purchase of health insurer Aetna before the Thanksgiving holiday.
Symantec rallied after the security software maker said it bought two smaller companies. It didn't disclose terms. Shares of Symantec rose further after Reuters reported that private equity firm Thoma Bravo is interested in buying the company. The stock jumped 12.6 percent to $22.54.
Among materials companies, Mosaic rose 10.6 percent to $35.64 after it raised its annual profit forecast, and Martin Marietta climbed 8.4 percent to $189.55. Construction materials company Vulcan gained 3.5 percent to $104.12.
Industrial companies also rose. Caterpillar climbed 2.3 percent to $129.33 and Boeing added 1.2 percent to $366.47.
Oil prices continued to slip after the U.S. said it would allow a group of allies to continue buying oil from Iran as long as they continued to try to reduce their imports from that nation. The U.S. reinstated sanctions on Iran this month after withdrawing from an international agreement intended to curb Iran's nuclear program, and analysts feared that oil prices would jump as supplies tightened.
Benchmark U.S. crude oil fell 1.4 percent to $62.21 a barrel in New York. In early October it traded above $76 a barrel. Brent crude dipped 1.4 percent to $72.13 a barrel in London.
Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 3.22 percent from 3.19 percent.
Britain's FTSE 100 shed 0.9 percent as Britain and the EU tried to resolve their differences over the Irish border. The two sides are trying to find a way to make sure there are no customs posts or other checks on the border between EU member Ireland and Northern Ireland, which will leave the group along with the rest of the U.K.
In France, the CAC 40 fell 0.5 percent. Germany's DAX dipped 0.1 percent.
In other commodities trading, wholesale gasoline was little changed at $1.69 a gallon and heating oil was also little changed at $2.19 a gallon. Natural gas remained at $3.56 per 1,000 cubic feet.
Gold shed 0.5 percent to $1,226.30 an ounce. Silver lost 1 percent to $14.50 an ounce. Copper fell 0.9 percent to $2.73 a pound.
The dollar rose to 113.40 yen from 113.21 yen. The euro slipped to $1.1413 from $1.1418.
Japan's Nikkei 225 index rose 1.1 percent and the Kospi in South Korea added 0.6 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng bounced gained 0.7 percent.

Full text: Teodoro Petkoff, a fiercely independent Venezuelan political figure -- whose cinematic trajectory from armed Marxist guerrilla to government minister to apostate under the country's socialist president, Hugo Chavez, reflected the evolution of the Latin American left -- died on Oct. 31 in Caracas. He was 86.
His death was announced by Tal Cual (Like It Is), the maverick newspaper he founded in 2000, which said he had been ailing since he was injured in a fall in 2012.
"He is a bold politician, with an energy that is felt even in a handshake," the novelist Gabriel GarcÃ­a MÃ¡rquez wrote of Mr. Petkoff in the Spanish newspaper El PaÃ­s in 1983, "but all his actions are commanded by common sense."
In a political career that spanned six decades, Mr. Petkoff fled escape-proof prisons twice, unsuccessfully sought the presidency three times and metamorphosed into an intellectual elder statesman.
"His life covered every step," Jorge CastaÃ±eda, a former foreign minister of Mexico and a professor at New York University, said in a telephone interview, "from Cuban-sponsored guerrilla fighter in the early '60s, to democratic socialism in the '70s, to becoming in the '80s and '90s a critic of the corrupt Venezuelan political system and someone trying to fix it without breaking it."
Mr. Petkoff became "constructively critical" of Mr. Chavez after he took office in 1999 but later sharpened his critique "to the point that his newspaper was shut down and he was the victim of constant harassment," Professor CastaÃ±eda, the author of "Utopia Unarmed: The Latin American Left After the Cold War" (1993), said.
"If you look at the Latin American left from the early 1960s you can see the same evolution -- less so in Venezuela," he continued. "He certainly both reflected that evolution and contributed to that evolution."
Mr. Petkoff joined the Communist Party in 1950, when he was an 18-year-old college student. But his abandonment of the armed struggle against a United States-supported government by the late 1960s prompted a rebuke from Fidel Castro, who denounced him and his former rebels as "traitors, temporizers and cowards." His disillusionment after the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 provoked Leonid I. Brezhnev, the Soviet leader, to denounce him as a "heretic."
Mr. Petkoff banded together with former guerrillas to establish the Movement Toward Socialism party in the early 1970s and embraced what he described as "democratic pluralism." He was elected to the Senate, but was swamped by multiple opponents when he sought the presidency in 1983 and 1988.
In the late 1990s, he served as planning minister under President Rafael Caldera. He was credited by Wall Street and the International Monetary Fund with returning state-run companies to private ownership, shrinking the bureaucracy and curbing inflation while improving social programs.
In 1998, he bolted the political party he had founded because it endorsed Mr. Chavez's presidential candidacy. In 2006, Mr. Petkoff mounted his third presidential campaign, a short-lived challenge to Mr. Chavez, by then an authoritarian firebrand, who successfully sought re-election and died in office in 2013.
By then Mr. Petkoff had became a full-time journalist, a job in which he won the prestigious MarÃ­a Moors Cabot and Ortega y Gasset prizes. He also wrote about a dozen books.
"He leaves Venezuela and the region without a mandate on social commitment, political coherence and defense of democratic values," Luis Almagro, secretary general of the Organization of American States, said on Twitter. "His struggle for freedom of expression and defense of human rights will never be forgotten."
Teodoro Petkoff Malec was born on Jan. 3, 1932, in El Batey, a community in Zulia State in northwestern Venezuela, to immigrants who had arrived in the 1920s. His father was from Bulgaria. His mother, who was Jewish, had immigrated from Poland.
He graduated with a bachelor's degree in economics from Central University of Venezuela in Caracas, where he later taught, and where he enlisted in the rebel movement that unseated the military dictator Marcos Perez Jimenez in 1958.
Complete information on survivors was not immediately available.
Twice in the 1960s, when he was being held for illegal Communist and guerrilla activity, Mr. Petkoff escaped from prison. On one occasion, he fled into a crowd of masked revelers on carnival night through a tunnel dug by fellow Communists from a grocery about 220 feet from his cell. On another, he swallowed a capsule of cow's blood to feign a gastric ulcer to get himself transferred to a less secure prison hospital and rappelled from a seventh-floor window by rope.
Just how much Venezuelan politics, and Mr. Petkoff, had matured since then was apparent from an anecdote he told about himself.
In 1980 he was attending a cocktail party, he told The New York Times, when he encountered a military man whom he had last seen 17 years earlier, when he was making his escape from the hospital window. As Mr. Petkoff was lowering himself, he recalled, he passed an officer who was gazing at him from the other side of a closed window. When Mr. Petkoff raised a finger to his lips, the officer instinctively remained silent.
"At the party, the officer told me that he had no idea I was an inmate escaping," Mr. Petkoff said. "He told me that if he had known I was Petkoff, he would have emptied his revolver into me."

Full text: Donald Trump's conservative critics have one last hope: defeat. If Republicans suffer humiliating defeats in the midterm elections, they suggest, President Trump will get the blame. Influential donors and grass-roots Republicans will turn on him, and the party will get back to normal. Not so long ago this was the party of Paul Ryan and free trade. This was the party of George W. Bush and compassionate conservatism. This was a party whose self-performed autopsy after the 2012 election called for more minority outreach. After Mr. Trump, why can't the Republicans be that party again? The ranks of anti-Trump Republicans grow thinner by the day. They're retiring from Congress. They're writing memoirs blasting their former friends. But they hold out hope for the future. If the Republican Party could undergo such a profound change in personality and policy thanks to just one man in a mere three years, who's to say it can't change back? The Trump coalition seems so impermanent, after all, a motley mix of Southern evangelicals, businessmen who think like the Chamber of Commerce and disaffected white voters from the Rust Belt. Throw in foreign-policy hawks and anti-interventionist America Firsters, and Mr. Trump's Republican Party looks like an impossible contradiction. It can't last. Can it?
Yes, it can. In fact, the party that President Trump has remade in his image is arguably less divided and in a better position to keep winning the White House than it has been at any time since the 1980s. What Mr. Trump has done is to rediscover the formula that made the landslide Republican Electoral College victories of the Nixon and Reagan years possible. Mr. Trump's signature themes of economic nationalism and immigration restriction are only 21st-century updates to the issues that brought the Republican Party triumph in all but one of the six presidential elections between 1968 and 1988.
Some of the parallels are obvious. President Trump talks about crime and left-wing agitation in much the same way that Richard Nixon once did -- and Ronald Reagan, too, especially during his time as governor of California. Mr. Trump's combination of force with an aversion to large-scale military interventions and nation-building also bears a resemblance to the policies of Republican presidents past. Dwight Eisenhower and Mr. Reagan also preferred to build up military strength without engaging in the kinds of prolonged wars for which Lyndon Johnson and George W. Bush are remembered. And while Mr. Nixon was mired in Vietnam, he ran as a candidate eager to find an exit.
Mr. Trump's willingness to deal with even as repellent a dictator as Kim Jong-un has a precedent in the creative diplomacy pursued by Mr. Nixon with Mao Zedong. If Mr. Trump is mocked for saying that he fell in love with Mr. Kim after an exchange of letters, Mr. Reagan was once mocked, too, and by conservatives at that, for his love affair with Mikhail Gorbachev. The foreign leaders may be very different, but the strong Republican's openness to negotiation is not.
But the most important ways in which Mr. Trump recapitulates the winning themes of earlier Republicans are less direct. Throughout the Cold War, Republicans presented themselves as the party of greater nationalism in the struggle against a global threat. If the United States was to survive in a world that seemed increasingly subjugated by international Communism, the country would have to embrace the party that was most anti-Communist.
The Soviet Union is long gone, but our national distinctiveness -- the American way of life -- is perceived to be under threat by new global forces, this time in the form of competition from China and international economic and regulatory bodies that compromise national sovereignty. Many voters see immigration as part of this story. They want America to control its borders by political choice, not to admit more immigrants because a global labor market insists that more must come for the good of all.
Even in the area where Mr. Trump seems most different from Republicans past, on trade, he has really returned to an older style of politics. Mr. Reagan was an economic nationalist, too, not just because he protected a company like Harley-Davidson against competition from Japan but more important because his pro-growth policies of deregulation and tax cuts were themselves the appropriate forms of economic nationalism for the 1980s. In the decades before the rise of China as an industrial superpower, economic nationalism was chiefly a matter of keeping the American economy entrepreneurial -- defending it against red tape and business-unfriendly policies at home rather than the predatory economic strategies of foreign governments.
By the early 1990s, the Reagan economic strategy -- a mix of entrepreneurship, tough bargaining and limited protection -- had succeeded against stiff competition from Japan. That victory was squandered, however, by Republicans and Democrats starting later in that decade who pursued economic policy not in terms of national industry but as an exercise in global ideological consumerism.
The Republican Party began in the 19th century as a free-labor party, built on the interest of workers who did not want to compete with the cheaper labor of an expanding slave economy. After the Civil War, the Republicans were the party of industry and protection, which also made it the party of jobs. Only the Great Depression brought an end to the dominance that Republicans long enjoyed as a result. After World War II, Republicans failed when they made feints in the direction of overthrowing the New Deal. The Democrats became the party of industry and jobs, until inflation and stagnation created an opening for a new Republican business strategy. And it was a strategy -- not an ideological doctrine.
The business side of President Trump's coalition still puts its bottom line ahead of its theoretical commitments: Mr. Trump has produced a very good environment for business, no matter what the business executives think about his tariffs. They want to win elections so that they can continue to prosper, and if that means electing more protectionists after Mr. Trump, that is a price they are readily willing to pay.
Grass-roots evangelical Christians and Rust Belt workers, meanwhile, both find something to like in an America that reaffirms its economic exceptionalism and sovereignty. That, no less than Mr. Trump's loyalty to Christian conservatives on abortion and other issues, is why evangelical voters have not abandoned him. And it's why Mr. Trump won states like Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania that had eluded other Republican presidential nominees since 1988.
Few Republicans running this year seem to understand what gave Mr. Trump his edge in 2016 -- it was not that he was simply combative and rhetorically right-wing. It was that he had a vision of what it meant to make American great again, by making the Republicans a party for the nation again.

Full text: The United States economy is the strongest it has been in ages. Growth has been robust, and the unemployment rate is at generational lows, as new data Friday affirmed. Yet the Republican Party, which controls the White House and Congress, trails Democrats substantially in polling on which party is preferred.
It helps to look beyond the overall economic data to understand this disconnect. After all, you can't eat G.D.P., and good jobs numbers aren't the same as a place to live.
If you look instead at the actual financial lives of average middle-income families from 2016 -- their incomes, spending, assets and debt -- and how shifts since Election Day in 2016 would have been likely to affect them, you get a more mixed picture.
Wages haven't risen much. Inflation has been low, helping keep the price of most staple goods down, though with gasoline prices a costly exception. The tax cut has left more money in most middle-class families' pockets, but only a bit.
In terms of assets, the typical middle-income family has either zero or minimal holdings in the stock market, meaning the surge since November 2016 hasn't paid direct benefits. But a majority of households in this income bracket do carry some credit card debt, which has become more expensive amid rising interest rates.
And in terms of housing costs, rents haven't risen much -- but a sharp rise in mortgage rates has made homes less affordable for anyone looking to buy.
Add it all up, and while the benefits of a surging economy, tax cuts and the rising stock market are real, they net out to a less favorable economic reality for a family in the middle of the income scale than the economic headlines might imply.
This math is oversimplified -- it doesn't reflect how families may have changed their spending and saving patterns in the last two years, and conflates different definitions of middle income. But the back-of-the-envelope results are revealing:
If you take the benefits of higher wages and the lower taxes, subtracting higher costs for consumer goods and higher interest rates on credit card debt -- it works out to a gain of $122 a month.
Slow wage growth, a boost from tax cuts, low inflation
A lower unemployment rate may benefit workers by making it easier for someone who loses a job to find a new one. But a defining feature of the expansion for years has been relatively tepid growth in wages.
The median pay for a full-time worker in the United States -- now $893 a week -- has risen enough since late 2016 to generate an extra $204 a month in pretax earnings for a household with a single earner, a 5.6 percent gain.
Subtract payroll taxes and federal income taxes on that raise, and that family is looking at $158 a month in additional earnings.
The tax cuts enacted at the start of 2018 should mean most middle-income Americans keep a bit more of their earnings. Analysis by the Tax Policy Center found that of the 91 percent of middle-income tax filers who received a tax cut, the reduction averages $910, or about $76 a month.
Wages may not be growing very fast for middle-income people, but the good news is that prices of most of the things they buy have been rising even more slowly.
The Consumer Price Index excluding housing costs is up only 3.2 percent since November 2016, adding about $101 to the monthly expenses of a family with spending patterns that match those of an average family in the middle 20 percent of the income distribution that year.
When you look at individual items that compose a large portion of family budgets, the relatively low inflation comes through.
Grocery prices -- "food at home" in the Labor Department's terminology -- are up only 1.1 percent in the nearly two years since November 2016, adding $3.33 to the monthly grocery bill for an average family in the middle 20 percent of income.
Outside of food, the pattern mostly recurs. Electricity bills are up 0.42 percent, a mere 50 cents a month of additional expense. Apparel is slightly less expensive than it was in November 2016, saving a middle-class family $1.22 a month. An 11 percent drop in the price of cellphone service saves that family $10.48 each month.
The big exception is gasoline; its price has been marching steadily higher since late 2016. The 23.5 percent run-up in the price of motor fuels adds $37.38 to the typical family's monthly expenses.
Fine time for renters, but higher rates hurt would-be buyers
When it comes to housing, it matters a lot whether you're renting and planning to continue renting; renting but seeking to buy a home; or already own one.
For renters who plan to stay renters, costs are rising modestly, just like overall inflation -- 3 percent since November 2016, tacking an extra $26.54 onto monthly costs for the average renter.
Homeowners typically have their monthly mortgage costs already set. Their wealth -- the value of their home -- has risen a bit in two years. The median sale price for a home in the United States was $214,000 in November 2016, according to data from Zillow, and the national appreciation rate since then implies such a house would now be worth $230,000.
Things are trickier for a renter looking to buy a home, because of rising mortgage rates. A side effect of the surging economy and deficit-increasing tax cuts has been higher rates, which means that even though home prices aren't up all that much in the last two years, the cost for a buyer needing credit is considerably higher.
The rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 3.5 percent at election time two years ago, and is now 4.83 percent. Combined with the rise in the price of the median home, a middle-income American family looking to buy with 20 percent down would be looking at a monthly mortgage payment that is $196 a month higher now than in November 2016, wiping out gains from higher wages and lower taxes.
A market boom for a few, and higher interest rates for others
The Trump administration has pointed to the booming stock market as evidence of success: The Standard & Poor's 500 index has returned about 29 percent, including reinvested dividends, since November 2016.
But middle-income families typically have minimal direct exposure to the stock market. Their financial holdings tend to be modest at best, meaning that rising stock prices create only a small wealth increase.
Among middle-income families in 2016, only 52 percent held stocks either directly or indirectly, such as through a mutual fund. And of those 52 percent, median stock holdings were only $15,000. (That would be up to around $19,000 now if they left the money in an S.&P. 500 index fund since then without making further contributions.)
Stock investments are much more a feature of upper-income brackets. The same survey showed that 94.7 percent of families in the top 10 percent of income held stocks, with a median value of $363,400.
Many middle-income Americans, 84.3 percent of them, do tend to hold some form of debt. And rising interest rates in the Trump economy -- a consequence of strong economic growth and Federal Reserve actions meant to prevent the economy from overheating -- are making that debt more costly.
In 2016, 53 percent of middle-income households had credit card debt, with an average debt balance of $4,400. The average rate on such debt has risen to 16.5 percent today from 13.6 percent in November 2016, implying an extra $10.50 a month in interest cost for a family carrying that balance.
In other words, debtors -- and the average middle-class American fits that description -- are paying a price for the surging economy even as they enjoy the benefits of higher pay and low inflation.
Given the limitations in the data on which these calculations are based, it's best to think of this analysis as an impressionistic painting rather than a high-resolution photograph of the economic lives of the middle class.
But it is a telling one, and helps explains the limits of a political message built on what seems to be a booming economy. It booms for some people more than others.
How we did the math
To develop this portrait, we started with two government surveys from 2016: the Labor Department's Consumer Expenditure Survey, which provides details of household spending patterns broken down by income bracket, and the Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances, which details assets and debt.
Then, we simply extrapolated forward to the fall of 2018. If those patterns among middle-class families held steady as they were buffeted by economywide forces, would they be better or worse off in the days before the midterms?
This is assuming that they had no radical changes to their financial lives like getting a lucrative new job or winning the lottery, and that their wages, costs and investment performances plugged along at average rates over the last 23 months.
Because of limitations in the data available for the recent past, we had to combine data sources that aren't really meant to be combined. We had to switch between different definitions of middle income, and we made some simplifying assumptions. (For example, we calculated how higher gasoline prices would increase people's spending without adjusting for how they might react to higher prices by driving less.)

Full text: There has been a deficit of cheerful news lately about American politics. And with the midterm elections looming, it may be difficult to think clearly about anything else.
So here's a tidbit that may be diverting and even mildly comforting: The midterms have consistently been good for the stock market.
Remarkably, this has been true for every midterm election since World War II.
The data shows that it hasn't mattered who won or lost or which party controlled the White House or Congress, either before the voting or as a result of it. Whatever the political configuration or the election results, the midterm election season has been an excellent one for stocks.
The pattern "gives a very positive message for the market," said Ed Clissold, chief United States Strategist for Ned Davis Research. "It's only part of the picture, but it's a positive part."
The numbers tell the story. Since 1946, in years with midterm elections, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has gained a median of 18.4 percent in the nine-month period from Sept. 30, just ahead of voting, through June 30 of the following year, according to data compiled by Ned Davis Research. In that same period in nonvoting years, the index gained 4.9 percent.
Diving a little deeper into the Ned Davis data, the pattern is evident when presidential terms are broken down into three-month quarters. Each four-year presidential term has 16 quarters, and the best one has typically been the quarter we are in now, the fourth quarter of a midterm year.
In this midterm quarter, the stock index since 1946 has gained 7.5 percent on average. The next best two quarters in performance have been the next two quarters chronologically -- the first and second quarters in the year after the midterm election -- with average gains of 7.5 percent and 6.6 percent.
There have been declines within these periods -- including one, in 1946, as large as a 15.4 percent loss -- but in every case, the net result for the nine-month midterm season was a market gain.
But why? That's the problem with this pattern: Because presidential motivations and actions aren't sufficiently documented, there is no conclusive explanation, though a great deal of academic work has been done on this subject, as I've written just before the last two midterm elections.
The main working hypothesis is a cynical one: Presidents are politicians who care overwhelmingly about their own re-election. (And to a much lesser extent, two-term presidents look to ensure the election of their successors.) They stimulate the economy -- and, indirectly, the stock market -- for maximum effect as their own elections grow closer, or so the theory goes.
That implies that their first year in office is the best time to make politically painful moves, which won't hurt them in the polls later. And it follows that it's better to gin up the economy in the second half of their tenure, starting around the midterms. If the good times are going to roll, let them roll closer to a presidential election.
Cause and effect have been difficult to prove. The one case with a smoking gun occurred, naturally enough, in the Nixon administration.
Secret White House tapes, combined with the investigations of the special prosecutor and the House Judiciary Committee, as well as efforts by private individuals and researchers, are gradually giving us a more precise view of the internal workings of the government in that era than is available for other administrations.
Thanks to those Nixon White House tapes, Burton A. Abrams, an economics professor at the University of Delaware, has shown that in 1971 and early in the 1972 election year, President Richard Nixon secretly pressured the Federal Reserve chairman, Arthur F. Burns, to expand the money supply, with the goal of ensuring Mr. Nixon's second term.
Mr. Nixon took other actions, including the imposition of wage and price controls to curb inflation, all aimed at improving his standing in the polls. And he crushed Senator George McGovern in the presidential election of 1972.
In some cases, however, presidents appeared to act against their own self-interest in economic matters. In retrospect, President Jimmy Carter's appointment of Paul Volcker as chairman of the Federal Reserve in July 1979 may be seen in this light, as a public-spirited sacrifice.
Mr. Volcker's tight monetary policy reined in the rampant inflation of the era, but also helped to start the recession that lasted from January through July in 1980 -- and doomed President Carter's bid for a second term. (The Iran hostage crisis didn't help, of course.) Carter lost to Ronald Reagan in November 1980.
Still, the patterns in the stock market over a very long period appear to be persuasive. (Even for Mr. Carter, the stock market eked out a small gain, 0.4 percent, in the midterm election quarter.)
But even if the overall pattern is more than an elaborate series of coincidences, and even if presidential self-interest causes it, it's possible that President Trump may be so singular that little of this applies.
For one thing, the administration's timing on economic matters seems to have been off, as far as this stock market cycle goes. Last winter's tax cut and the current, widening budget deficit have stimulated the economy, but way ahead of the typical schedule -- so far ahead, in fact, that they may not help Mr. Trump's re-election odds in 2020.
The Federal Reserve is already raising interest rates and is expected to continue through next year, which could slow the economy as the presidential election approaches. Despite the Fed's independent status, Mr. Trump has repeatedly criticized the central bank's moves, with no apparent effect so far.
The stock market often moves ahead of the economy, responding to changing expectations. Because the economy -- and corporate earnings -- have been so strong lately, year-over-year comparisons are widely expected be less favorable in 2019.
By 2020, many strategists say, the chances of a recession are mounting. And with the prospect of declining growth rates ahead, the market has given up gains lately, and bullish Wall Street forecasters have been lowering their targets.
Of course, the Fed could back off if the economy slackens. And the administration could engage in further fiscal stimulus after the midterms by enacting one of its campaign promises, a big infrastructure investment plan. But its ability to do so depends on the election results. So will its ability to meet another stated goal, further tax cuts.
Will the midterm pattern be sustained once more? Its overwhelming consistency is formidable. But so is Mr. Trump's ability to shatter convention.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- President Trump has yet to follow through on a threat to cut off hundreds of millions of dollars in annual aid to three Central American nations from which migrants and refugees are moving toward the United States border, according to the head of the main American foreign aid agency. "I'm not aware of firm decisions being made," Mark Green, the administrator of the United States Agency for International Development, said Friday during a wide-ranging interview at his office a few blocks southeast of the White House. "I know it's under review."
The lack of action calls into question whether Mr. Trump actually intends to punish the three countries, Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, for failing to stop the migrants, or whether his remarks are just political grandstanding. With Republican control of the House in peril in the midterm elections on Tuesday, the president has escalated his anti-immigrant messaging to appeal to voters.
The aid agency, known as U.S.A.I.D., has supplied data to White House officials that lay out programs and amounts of aid given to those three countries, as is typical.
"It's true that the White House is taking a close look at all assistance that is provided to these three countries," said Mr. Green, a former ambassador and Republican congressman from Wisconsin. "Quite frankly, that's not unusual. We're constantly examining and re-examining our assistance programs."
Mr. Green pointed to a separate refugee movement, in Venezuela, as a crisis of historic proportions that his agency was trying to help address.
As the economy in Venezuela has collapsed and inflation has risen sharply under President NicolÃ¡s Maduro, two million to three million people have fled the country in recent years.
"The consequences of this mass movement I think are serious," Mr. Green said. "I think they'll have consequences for economies. They'll certainly have humanitarian consequences."
The United States has announced several times this year that it will give tens of millions of dollars in aid to Venezuela's neighbors -- notably Colombia -- to help the refugees. In total, more than $96 million, intended mainly for food and health aid, has been dedicated to the effort.
Some have argued the United States should give more.
The United States will continue responding to requests for humanitarian aid from those countries, and will evaluate needs each time, Mr. Green said.
In mid-October, a Navy hospital ship, the Comfort, left Norfolk, Va., on a four-month deployment in Latin America to help Venezuelan refugees. On a visit to Panama and Mexico last month, Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, talked about the ship's role in providing medical aid.
Mr. Trump has made Venezuela a campaign topic, falsely claiming that Democrats want to carry out socialist policies like those that have wrecked the Venezuelan economy. But in recent weeks, he has made a much bigger issue of the Central American migrants and refugees, describing a slowly approaching caravan as an "invasion of our country."
At campaign rallies and on Twitter, the president has consistently demonized the group. The caravan, swelling to 7,000 at one point, has dwindled in size as it travels north. Only a small number are expected to reach the United States-Mexico border, but Mr. Trump has threatened to send up to 15,000 military troops there.
The president also suggested he would cut off aid, saying on Twitter last month: "Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador were not able to do the job of stopping people from leaving their country and coming illegally to the U.S. We will now begin cutting off, or substantially reducing, the massive foreign aid routinely given to them."
Mr. Green said Mr. Trump had not spoken to him about ending or reducing the aid. He said that the topic of aid to the Central American nations had come up at meetings with other agencies, but that it was one of a range of issues under discussion.
"To be honest, there are a lot of things that are high on the agenda," he said. "So sure, I mean, we're asked about Central America, we're asked about the Indo-Pacific strategy. This is a very active time for all of us who are involved in foreign policy, including development assistance."
Mr. Trump and senior officials have cut off aid or threatened to cut off aid to nations or to populations as a way to try to gain leverage on policy negotiations. For example, the State Department is barring American humanitarian aid workers from entering North Korea during negotiations over Pyongyang's nuclear program.
And the White House has ended all civilian aid to Palestinians this year, citing their refusal to negotiate with the Americans and Israelis. Palestinian officials took a hard stand after Mr. Trump announced last year that the United States Embassy would move to Jerusalem; the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state.
Asked whether the Trump White House had generally embraced a strategy of withholding or threatening to withhold aid to meet policy goals, Mr. Green pointed to American interests.
"Our job is to be a vibrant tool in the toolbox of American foreign policy," Mr. Green said. "Foreign assistance must always serve American interests."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text: Win, lose or draw on Tuesday, the Democratic Party will almost immediately turn its focus to the next presidential election and the fight between the establishment center and the left wing. But while the Democrats have that argument, they must also undertake the far more important task of thinking about what they agree on, and how they can construct a story about how the economy works and grows and spreads prosperity, a story that competes with -- and defeats -- the Republicans' own narrative. For 40 years, with a few exceptions, Democrats have utterly failed to do so. Until they fix this, they will lose economic arguments to the Republicans -- even though majorities disagree with the Republicans on many questions -- because every economic debate will proceed from Republican assumptions that make it all but impossible for Democrats to argue their case forcefully.
Republicans have a theory and a story about how the economy grows. You know it as supply-side economics: Cutting taxes, especially on the rich, and decreasing regulation will unleash so much innovation and economic activity that tax revenues will actually increase and the entire economy will benefit.
This has been the conservative story, which the right has elevated to veritable religion, for 30 or 40 years now. And the Democrats' alternative story is ... what? If you're not recalling it, that's because there isn't one.
The Democrats have impulses, they have beliefs, they even have principles. But they don't have a story to challenge the supply-side story and tell people about how the economy grows and helps everyone.
They used to, once upon a time. It was called Keynesianism, or sometimes demand-side economics (which is why conservatives named their theory supply-side). Keynesianism -- in a nutshell, government investment in public goods increase demand and prosperity -- held sway from the 1940s through the 1970s, the greatest period of economic growth in history.
Then came stagflation, which opened the door for the supply-siders. Democrats, by and large, stopped talking about theories. Their story was discredited, so the supply-siders said. Democrats stopped defending public investment, and they stopped defending government.
They still defend particular investments that poll well, like infrastructure spending. And they defend specific programs when they know they're on safe ground, like Social Security and Medicare. And now that Obamacare, or at least the part about making insurers cover people with pre-existing conditions, is registering positive numbers, they're happy to defend it, as they should.
But none of this amounts to an answer to supply-side economics. None of it creates an alternative story about how prosperity is spread.
It seems to me that the Democrats' story has to be built around the simple idea of investing in middle- and working-class people. Not "spending," but "investing." Spending sounds profligate; investing sounds prudent.
This is not to be done for reasons of "fairness." That's an absolutely vital point. Liberals reflexively want to make economic arguments about fairness. But this persuades only liberals. People who aren't liberals -- three-quarters of the country -- don't especially care about fairness. They do, however, care about growth. So Democrats need to argue that these investments, not tax cuts for the rich, are the way to spur growth.
Such an argument stands in direct contrast to the right's story. Republicans say the rich, with millions returned to them in the form of tax cuts, know best what to do with their money and the market can make the best decisions about investments and society's needs.
It should be fairly easy for Democrats to say to Americans: Look around you. How has that worked out for you?
Inequality is rampant. People fear being bankrupted by medical catastrophe (though not as much as they once did, thanks to President Barack Obama). Young people in college spend 25 years paying off debt. Young people not in college are working three jobs, none of which pays benefits or gives them steady hours. Your town is probably a shell of its former self, and some of your friends and relatives -- all of them good, decent people -- are in the grip of heroin or fentanyl addiction. This is what 40 years of market decision-making has done.
(By the way, the supply-siders' big promise about revenue was a fairy tale. The Bush tax cuts cost the Treasury at least $1.7 trillion. And the Trump tax cut has blown a new hole in the deficit, which Republicans want to patch, naturally, by cutting middle-class entitlements.)
So that's the easy half of the story -- criticizing supply-side's failures. The harder half is making the affirmative case for the Democratic theory of growth.
It shouldn't be so hard. Take, again, wages. Expanding overtime pay, raising wages, even doing something about the enormous and under-discussed problem of wage theft -- we don't wish to address these problems, Democrats should say, out of fairness or compassion or some desire to punish capitalists. We want to address them because putting more money in working- and middle-class people's pockets is a better way to spur on the economy than giving rich people more tax cuts.
That's an argument that might appeal broadly, but it's backed up by a theory that in our time is practically seditious: that the public sector can make better decisions about where money should go than the private sector. That is a principle Democrats have been skittish about supporting. But it is one they must start defending without apology.
They should defend it because it's what more and more economists argue and because it's what Democrats believe. There's a lot of ideological space between Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Representative RaÃºl Grijalva of Arizona, who is among the most left-leaning members of the House. But they're both Democrats for a reason, and presumably that reason is they think government can be a force for good in people's lives. So, if Democrats think it, they should say it.
And now we have arrived at an alternate theory, a story: Giving more money to working people and investing in their needs is how an economy grows. That's a direct counterargument to supply-side economics. If enough Democrats say it and say it and say it, they can drive a stake through supply-side's heart.
Once Democrats can make that case, they'll be able to turn the tables on the supply-siders. Republicans will argue that government investments and wage increases are "job killers." But Democrats, rather than merely appealing to people's consciences, will be able to respond that government investments and wage increases are growth producers that will spread benefits well beyond the top 5 percent or 10 percent.
The story could use a name. The venture capitalist Nick Hanauer and Eric Liu, a former Bill Clinton domestic policy adviser, coined "middle-out economics" five years ago. President Obama even used the phrase a few times.
The important thing is the idea. Democrats must persuade America that there's a better way to expand the economy than the way Republicans have been advocating for decades. Just as inflation and other ills opened the door for critiques of Keynesianism in the 1970s, so have inequality and disinvestment done the same for critiques of supply-side today. Someone just has to make them.

Full text: Stocks slipped on Friday as Apple shares absorbed their worst loss in more than four years. Thanks to gains over the previous three days, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index finished with its biggest weekly increase since March. Apple, the world's largest technology company, forecast weak revenue in the current quarter and startled investors by saying it would stop disclosing quarterly iPhone sales. That pulled technology stocks lower. Other high-growth stocks held up well after the United States and China said they had made some progress in trade talks, and Asian indexes surged on reports that China's government plans to cut taxes.
The Department of Labor said employers added 250,000 jobs in October, with no sign that hiring was going to slow down. The proportion of Americans with jobs is at its highest level since January 2009, and hourly wages also grew by the most since then. Along with high consumer confidence, those are all good signs for economic growth and consumer spending in the months to come.
Bond yields surged following the strong jobs report as investors bet on continued economic growth, which would push the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates more quickly.
"It clearly was a good report," said David Lefkowitz, senior equity strategist Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management.
Growth in wages was about what investors were expecting, Mr. Lefkowitz said. That is important because investors are still sensitive to signs that inflation could flare up, forcing the Federal Reserve to be more aggressive in raising rates. If inflation grows moderately, that would not be as likely.
The S.&P. 500 index slid 17.31 points, or 0.6 percent, to 2,723.06. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 109.91 points, or 0.4 percent, to 25,270.83.
The Nasdaq composite, which has a high concentration of technology companies, lost 77.06 points, or 1 percent, to 7,356.99.
Stocks had surged over the previous three days and finished the week 2.4 percent higher. They skidded in October, suffering their worst monthly loss in seven years. The S.&P. 500 will have to rise another 7.6 percent to match the record high it reached on Sept. 20.
Bond prices dropped, sending yields sharply higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note jumped to 3.22 percent, from 3.13 percent. A jump in interest rates last month started the market's downturn, but investors on Friday did not seem as worried. Interest rates will also be in focus when the Federal Reserve meets next week, though it is not expected to raise rates in November.
Apple stock sagged 6.6 percent to $207.48. Shares of chip-makers also fell. Qorvo stock lost 5.7 percent to $74 and Broadcom stock fell 4 percent to $220.77.
Starbucks's sales were better than expected, and customers spent more after it raised prices for brewed coffee. The stock jumped 9.7 percent to $64.42, its biggest gain since 2011. Kraft Heinz shares sank 9.7 percent to $50.73 after its third-quarter profit fell way short of analyst forecasts.
The governments of the United States and China both said they were making some progress in trade talks. It has been months since the two sides made any visible progress, and fears that the dispute was getting worse contributed to the big losses for global markets in October. Chinese state media also said President Xi Jingping promised tax cuts and other help to China's entrepreneurs.
In Germany, the DAX rose 0.4 percent and in France, the CAC 40 gained 0.3 percent. The FTSE 100 was down 0.3 percent in Britain.
The Nikkei 225 surged 2.6 percent in Japan, while in Hong Kong, the Hang Seng soared 4.2 percent. The Kospi was up 3.5 percent in South Korea.
The dollar rose to 113.16 yen from 112.70 yen. The euro slipped to $1.1394 from $1.1409.
Oil prices continued to slip. Benchmark United States crude fell 0.9 percent to $63.14 a barrel in New York and Brent crude shed 0.1 percent to $72.83 a barrel in London.
Gold fell 0.4 percent to $1,231.70 an ounce. Silver dipped 0.1 percent to $14.75 an ounce.

Employers in U.S. Add 250,000 Jobs As Economy Hums

Full text: The last official snapshot of the economy before Americans vote on Tuesday offered another reminder of the labor market's persistent strength. Hiring is up. Wages are up. The total number of workers and job searchers is up. "It's really the strongest part of the broader economy at the moment," Michelle Girard, chief United States economist at NatWest Markets, said of the labor market.
A swerving stock market, tariffs and weakening growth in other countries may be causing agita, but they have done little to dent economic momentum in the United States. Employers added 250,000 jobs in October, extending a record streak of growth to 97 months, the Labor Department reported on Friday.
The economy has historically not played an outsize role in midterm elections, and this political season, border control, health care and Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court have gobbled up airtime and political ad space. Still, about three-quarters of registered voters say the economy is "very important" in determining their vote, according to polls conducted by the Pew Research Center. Among Republicans, that number is even higher at 85 percent.
"Jobs and the economy" was also cited more frequently than other issues as the most important in a survey conducted in early October for The New York Times by the online research platform SurveyMonkey.
A recent string of reports suggests both are in good shape. Last week, the government estimated that the economy grew at a hearty annualized rate of 3.5 percent in the third quarter. Confidence remains high among consumers and business leaders. Over the past year, employers have added an average of 210,000 jobs a month.
Friday's roundup also offered evidence that sidelined workers are not only feeling optimistic about job prospects but are actually finding work, which is why the jobless rate was unchanged at 3.7 percent even as employers hired more people. An estimated 711,000 people joined the labor force last month. President Trump, on Friday, called the numbers "tremendous."
A modest monthly wage gain of 0.2 percent nonetheless produced a surprisingly big 3.1 percent jump in annual growth. That was partly because of an unusual drop in pay in October last year after hurricanes. Yet even if the year-over-year increase was somewhat inflated, the underlying trends point to a pickup in wage growth.
Some analysts saw warnings of inflation, but others said the pay increase should not bother policymakers at the Federal Reserve. "I don't think it's something the Fed should worry about," Ms. Girard said. "Productivity growth is picking up, and workers should earn more. It doesn't mean companies have to pass on higher wage costs to consumers. They can afford to pay them more."
The Fed, which has increased rates three times this year from historically low levels, is expected to raise them again to 2.5 percent in December as a hedge against inflation.
Mr. Trump has called the Fed "loco" and "out of control" for raising interest rates, and blamed it for the recent drop in stock prices and for potentially derailing the economy.
In a call with reporters, Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, cited productivity growth as the explanation for higher wages, and not an overheating economy. He also took the opportunity to say that the president respects the Fed's independence.
As always, the monthly jobs report captures only a particular moment; the underlying trend is what's important. That caution is particularly pertinent this time.
The back-to-back hurricanes in September and October may have distorted the data in unpredictable ways. "It looks good, but it's never happened before when you have hurricanes making landfall in successive survey weeks," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
Manufacturing jobs -- which have traditionally paid well and have been a focus of Mr. Trump's policies -- increased by a healthy 32,000.
Here, too, Mr. Shepherdson advised skepticism, noting that the Institute for Supply Management reported this week that its manufacturing index had fallen to a six-month low amid worries about tariffs, shortages of parts and a drop in global demand.
"If I were a Republican politician, I would be shouting about it," Mr. Shepherdson said, referring to manufacturing. "But there's no way that growth is going to continue." Manufacturing sectors in China, in particular, and Europe are weakening sharply. Producers, he said, are worried about "tariffs, tariffs, tariffs."
October's figures will be revised twice more, and September's once more.
Although the unemployment rate has consistently surfed below the levels reached in 2000, at the height of that expansion, wages have been growing at significantly slower rates.
Low wages in many sectors have contributed to financial instability. More than a quarter of Americans don't earn enough to cover basic expenses, while more than a third are unable to pay all their bills on time, according to a report released Thursday by the Center for Financial Services Innovation, which is funded by nonprofit foundations and several banks. That shortfall has contributed to mounting credit card debt and loan defaults.
October's report, however, is among several recent signs that wage growth is gathering steam.
According to a report last week from the research arm of the payroll processing firm ADP, American workers are earning nearly $1 more per hour on average than they were a year ago.
Protolabs, a digital manufacturing company based in Minnesota, hired 50 people last month, bringing the year's total to 340, a pace it expects to match in 2019, said Renee Conklin, vice president for human resources. But the competition for workers is becoming stiffer. "We're seeing more employers making counteroffers to retain people," Ms. Conklin said.
Since the recession ended, analysts have struggled to understand how many more potential workers are out there. Before the financial crisis, more than 66 percent of the population 16 or older was working or looking for a job. In recent years, that number -- the labor-force participation rate -- has rarely risen above 63 percent.
Many of those missing workers will never rejoin the labor force -- some have reached retirement age, others have seen their skills lose value, and a number are too disabled to work.
Economists continue to argue about how many more people could be lured back to the labor market. Rising wages are certainly one attraction.
Women are coming back into the work force at a much faster rate than men, however. And over the past year, a net total of 1.4 million women have joined compared with 845,000 men. Drawing in even more women would require better child care, paid parental leave and more flexible hours, said Betsey Stevenson, an economist at the University of Michigan. "We know what to do for women," she said. "We're really at a loss as to what to do to induce more men back."
Job opportunities are also rippling out to groups that were largely bypassed during much of the recovery: African-Americans, Hispanics, less-educated workers and people with disabilities have all seen their unemployment rates drop in recent months.
Employers say they are constantly on the hunt for workers. "I speak to probably a thousand businesspeople a month," said Rick Lazio, a former Republican congressman who is a senior vice president at Alliantgroup, a tax-credit consulting firm. Midsize manufacturers are turning down lots of business, he said, "because they can't find the people and they can't get the equipment fast enough."
Help is not coming from abroad: The number of immigrant visas issued by the government has declined for two years in a row.
Worries about fierce competition for holiday hiring have prompted employers to be more aggressive, putting offers out earlier than usual and raising wages, recruiters said.
United Parcel Service has said it plans to hire 100,000 seasonal workers. Several applicants for packing or delivery positions who showed up at the company's hulking customer center in Manhattan during a recent nationwide hiring drive said they hoped temporary stints would turn into permanent jobs. A company spokesman said holiday positions paid $10.35 to $30 an hour, depending on the location.
"I'm just praying," said Chanique Cox, 42, who did not finish high school. She knocked her knuckles on a wooden counter and clicked her blue nails. "I'm only finding temporary jobs. I would love it if I got a permanent job."

Full text: BEIJING -- As the United States and China swap threats and mete out increasingly punishing tariffs, the world is watching to see whether Beijing turns to one of its most potent economic weapons. It involves the number 7. China's currency, the renminbi, has been gradually losing value since mid-April, and on Tuesday it was at its weakest point in a decade. If the currency weakens any further, it could fall below the psychologically important level of 7 renminbi to the dollar. The last time it took more than 7 renminbi to buy a dollar was in May 2008, as the world was slipping into a financial crisis.
The Trump administration doesn't like the idea of a weaker Chinese currency. That could give what it considers an unfair advantage to China's exporters. In the arsenal of trade disputes, currencies can be potent weapons.
But China has good reason to keep its currency from weakening, and it appears to have acted in recent weeks to prop it up. Currencies may be potent weapons, but they are blunt ones -- and they can boomerang against those who use them.
What happens if the renminbi falls past 7 to the dollar?
There is nothing particularly threatening about the number 7 itself. The renminbi at 7.002 to the dollar is pretty similar to the currency at 6.998 to the dollar.
But passing that number would be significant symbolically. It would suggest China is prepared to let its currency weaken further still. That would give China's factory owners an advantage when they sell their goods in the United States. It would also undermine the tariffs the Trump administration has levied on more than $250 billion in Chinese-made products.
How would that help China?
Say you own a Chinese factory making lawn ornaments, and you sell a lot of pink flamingos to an American retailer. You price each at $1 -- they may sell for far more in the United States, but shipping and storage account for most of that. When the renminbi is 6 to the dollar, that translates to 6 renminbi in sales.
But when the currency depreciates to 7 to the dollar, that $1 flamingo is worth 7 renminbi in sales to you. Or you can cut the price -- say, from $1 to 85.7 cents -- and still make your original 6 renminbi in sales. Your American competitor, who has to buy and sell in dollars, has to grudgingly cut prices to compete.
(It's a lot more complicated in the real world. The plastic and metal for the plastic flamingo may have been imported to China and are priced in dollars. But bear with us.)
A weaker currency can also help Chinese exporters beat President Trump's tariffs. Right now, the United States imposes tariffs of about 10 percent on a wide variety of Chinese goods that arrive at an American port. If the renminbi has fallen 10 percent, the tariff is basically nullified.
What's driving the decline?
Some politicians in the United States and elsewhere have long said that China manipulates its currency, even though Washington officials -- including in the Trump administration -- have stopped short of official accusations. But in this case, many of the forces weakening the currency are beyond Beijing's immediate control.
China's financial system is firmly controlled by the government, giving the country's leaders a great degree of control over how much the renminbi is worth. Officials set a daily benchmark rate for the renminbi and allow its value to move a smidgen above or below that level in currency markets. Chinese officials say each day's trading activity helps determine the value they set for the renminbi the next day, but they disclose few details about how that works.
On Tuesday, Beijing set that guidepost at 6.9574, just a hair's breadth stronger than 7. In the world of foreign exchange, a higher number means a weaker currency.
Right now, traders are sending Beijing a single message: The renminbi should be worth less. The people and companies that hold the currency have become increasingly nervous about China's slowing economic growth, slumping stock market, fragile real estate market and seemingly intractable trade war with the United States. Inflation has begun to tick upward, and rising prices tend to make holding the relevant currency less attractive.
There are other reasons. Since late July, Beijing has tried to prop up the economy by having the state-controlled banking sector increase lending, making money more available. That means even more renminbi sloshing around, weakening the currency's value.
While China hasn't raised interest rates, the Federal Reserve in Washington has. That makes it attractive for many people to sell their renminbi and buy dollars. Would you rather have a one-year renminbi certificate of deposit that pays 1.5 percent interest now, or a one-year dollar C.D. that pays out 2.6 percent or more?
Is the drop deliberate on Beijing's part?
Not quite. If anything, Beijing is trying to keep the renminbi from falling too fast.
China has a number of ways to bolster the currency's value. One option is to follow the Fed's example and raise interest rates. That would give Chinese families and companies more incentive to keep their money in China. But that would raise the cost of borrowing in China, just as the economy is slowing.
Beijing could buy up its own currency instead. Like anything else, the renminbi's value rises when it is scarcer.
Thanks to the way it has managed its currency over the years, China has amassed the world's largest foreign exchange reserves -- a $3 trillion stash of money it keeps in dollars, euros, pounds, yen and other currencies. It has begun to tap that stash. When China's central bank released its monthly balance sheet a week ago, it showed a drop of almost $20 billion in foreign currency just during September.
"Selling almost $20 billion in a month won't break the bank," said Brad W. Setser, an economist at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. "But it does indicate the direction of current market pressure."
What are the broader risks?
Three years ago, as its economy slowed, China devalued the renminbi in part to give its factories a helping hand. The financial world was shocked. Markets plunged.
As Chinese officials hurried to explain themselves, people and companies began shifting their money -- money that China's economy needed -- outside the country. A year later, China had spent more than $500 billion from its reserves in an effort to shore up the renminbi. It later tightened controls on the financial system to shut off many ways people used to get money out of the country.
Should the trade war intensify, China may look to make more aggressive moves with its currency. But as history shows, there can be a price to pay.

Full text: Fear that the Trump administration will announce tariffs on all remaining imports from China helped knock stocks in the United States from a strong early gain to another sharp loss Monday. Technology companies sank again after Bloomberg News reported that the United States is planning new tariffs if the two sides do not make progress in trade talks next month.
Technology and internet companies, industrials and retailers took steep losses as Wall Street's recent bout of volatility continued. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has dropped 9.4 percent in October and is on track for its worst monthly loss since February 2009. That was right before the market hit its lowest point during the 2008-09 financial crisis.
Bloomberg News reported that the Trump administration will put tariffs on the rest of the country's imports from China if President Trump and Xi Jinping do not make substantial progress in easing the trade dispute next month.
The S.&P. 500 fell 17.44 points, or 0.7 percent, to 2,641.25. The Dow Jones industrial average gained as much as 352 points Monday morning but closed down 245.39 points, or 1 percent, to 24,442.92. It fell as much as 566 during the day.
The Nasdaq composite, which is heavily weighted with technology stocks, lost 116.92 points, or 1.6 percent, to 7,050.29.
Stocks have plunged since early October, breaking a long period of relative calm over the summer, and trading has been especially volatile the last few days.
Among industrials, Boeing sank 6.6 percent to $335.59. Some early gains for tech and internet stocks also faded. Microsoft shed 2.9 percent to $103.85. Alphabet, Google's parent company, lost 4.5 percent to $1,034.73.
Amazon.com dropped another 6.3 percent to $1,538.88. The online retailer tumbled Friday after it reported weak sales and gave a lower-than-expected revenue estimate for the quarter that includes the holiday shopping season. Its stock traded above $2,000 a share in early September and has fallen 24.5 percent since then.
The S.&P. 500 has fallen 9.9 percent from its latest record high on Sept. 20. The Nasdaq has plunged 13 percent from its record high reached Aug. 29.
For most of this year investors have remained hopeful that the United States and China would work out their disagreements on trade policy and that many of the tariffs would be reduced or eliminated. But in recent weeks they have lost some of their confidence, and that has contributed to the markets' tumble
The effects of higher tariffs could be especially severe for technology companies, which make many of their products in China, and for industrial companies, which are already paying higher prices for metals. The United States and China are the world's largest economies and their trade relationship is the world's largest, so the higher taxes on imports could also slow global economic growth and increase inflation.
While most technology companies fell, open-source software company Red Hat jumped after IBM agreed to buy it for $34 billion in stock. IBM's chairman and chief executive, Ginni Rometty, said the deal will make IBM the world's biggest hybrid cloud provider, meaning it will offer companies a mix of on-site, private and third-party public cloud services.
Red Hat soared 45.4 percent to $169.63, reversing its losses from earlier this year. IBM fell 4.1 percent to $119.64.
The prospect of reduced barriers to trade helped automakers on Monday. Car companies rose after Bloomberg News reported that regulators in China intend to propose cutting the tax on imported cars to 5 percent from 10 percent. The trade fight between the United States and China has hurt sales, and that slowdown is one of several factors that have damaged car company stocks this year.
Ford climbed 3.3 percent to $9.28 and auto parts retailer BorgWarner advanced 4 percent to $39.56. After Cooper Tire & Rubber reported a bigger third-quarter profit than analysts expected, its stock surged 21.4 percent to $30.89.
Bond prices dipped. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 3.09 percent from 3.08 percent.
The price of United States crude oil dropped 0.8 percent to $67.04 per barrel in New York.
Gold lost $8.00 to $1,224.50 an ounce.
The dollar rose to 112.35 yen from 111.85 yen. The euro fell to $1.1383 from $1.1407.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- In the House, the majority rules. Just ask Democrats, who have introduced bills destined for nowhere, watched oversight requests pile up and seen Republicans overrule most of their policy efforts. But if the Democrats take the House on Nov. 6, they will assume control of two of the most powerful tools in Washington: gavels and subpoenas.
The committee chairmen and women in waiting are mostly over 65 and considerably more diverse than the Republicans they would replace. They could become household names.
With chairmanships would come the power to compel the Trump administration to produce evidence, to call witnesses to the stand and to show voters -- ahead of 2020 -- how Democrats would run the government if given the chance.
Judiciary
Jerrold Nadler
New York
Lifelong New Yorkers, Mr. Nadler and President Trump have been at each other's throats since the 1990s, when Mr. Trump was a real estate developer and the Manhattan representative stood in the way of one of his West Side developments. Mr. Nadler's objections earned him a Trumpian jab -- "one of the most egregious hacks in contemporary politics" -- but as the chairman of one of the most powerful committees in Congress, Mr. Nadler could bring the president serious pain and potentially oversee his impeachment.
Mr. Nadler, 71, has pledged to start investigations into potential violations of anti-corruption clauses in the Constitution, Mr. Trump's apparent attempts to exert undue control over the F.B.I. and Justice Department, and accusations of sexual misconduct and perjury against Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh.
Mr. Nadler has said he would tread more carefully around the ongoing investigation of Mr. Trump's campaign and Russia. In the short term, that means protecting the special counsel overseeing the inquiry, Robert S. Mueller III. But when Mr. Mueller's work is complete, Mr. Nadler would be a key Democrat deciding whether to open an impeachment inquiry.
The committee also has jurisdiction over some of the Democrats' highest policy priorities, including writing laws on guns, immigration policy and voting rights.
Oversight and Government Reform
Elijah Cummings
Maryland
With his hands on the levers of the House's marquee investigative body, Mr. Cummings would face one of the Democrats' most perilous balancing acts: How to scrutinize the heap of Trump administration scandals left untouched by Republicans without appearing to overreach.
The son of sharecroppers, Mr. Cummings, 67, thinks he can pull it off. He is a blunt and fiery liberal beloved by his caucus who prizes strong working relationships with Republicans.
"This is not about trying to get any retribution. It is about trying to bring us back to a sense of integrity," he said.
Mr. Cummings has laid out two discreet lanes of inquiry: potential fraud and abuse by the White House and federal agencies; and broader issues that cut at what he refers to as "the soul of our democracy," such as voter suppression. With the second largest staff in the House, the committee could quickly initiate inquiries into issues like the hobbling of the Environmental Protection Agency, the White House's revocation of security clearances to voting rights, the 2020 census and implementation of the Affordable Care Act.
Financial Services
Maxine Waters
California
Perhaps no member of the House -- other than Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader -- has been a bigger target for Mr. Trump than Ms. Waters, the 80-year old firebrand from Los Angeles whom he routinely insults as stupid. Her incendiary language -- including calls for citizens to confront Trump administration officials in restaurants and other public places -- has made her a darling of the liberal left.
If Democrats take control, Ms. Waters can strike back. She has watched, unhappily, as Republicans have watered down the Dodd-Frank Act, the Obama-era legislation aimed at reining in risky banking practices and protecting consumers. At the helm of the Financial Services Committee, Ms. Waters would almost certainly move to undo the Republicans' changes and put teeth back into the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, though such efforts would have trouble passing a Republican Senate.
"Financial services issues are critical for all Americans and for our economy," she said in an emailed statement, "and I am focused on making sure that our financial system is fair."
Appropriations
Nita Lowey
New York
Women have been a driving force behind the Democrats' push to retake the House. If they are successful, Ms. Lowey would be the first chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee, the powerful panel that controls discretionary spending.
Look for Ms. Lowey, 81, to use the power of the purse to advance spending legislation that reflects the Democrats' policy goals, including expanding access to health care, lowering prescription drug prices, and increasing funding for child care and early education programs.
She led a successful push earlier this year to fund gun violence prevention studies at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; the agency had avoided such research for 20 years, fearing political repercussions. She said she intended to make certain such studies get underway. Separately, she will press for expanded funding for birth control and work to block Republican efforts to reduce spending on family planning or eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood.
"In my work as a woman appropriator," Ms. Lowey said, "I want to make sure that we're protecting women's health, women's rights."
Armed Services
Adam Smith
Washington State
Like other would-be chairman, Mr. Smith, a hawkish former prosecutor, wants badly to step up the committee's oversight role. He said last month at a defense conference that he would scrutinize overseas military operations, calling out the conflict in Yemen as antithetical to American values. The committee would also look to curtail the president's efforts to expand the nuclear arsenal, Mr. Smith said, and to protect lesbian, gay and transgender people serving in the armed forces.
At 53, he is one of the younger potential chairmen, though he has served in the House for more than 20 years.
Education and the Workforce
Bobby Scott
Virginia
A soft-spoken but forceful presence on Capitol Hill, Mr. Scott, 71, is the first African-American elected to Congress from Virginia since Reconstruction and a Harvard-educated former civil rights lawyer. He has been a sharp critic of Betsy DeVos, the education secretary.
High on Mr. Scott's list is addressing inequities in education. He has repeatedly called on the department to work harder to close the achievement gap between white students and minorities -- and has accused Ms. DeVos of permitting states to flout a law that requires schools to make progress toward that goal.
It will also be up to Mr. Scott to try to make good on the Democrats' promise to make college education affordable. He and his fellow Democrats have already introduced legislation, the Aim Higher Act, to expand access to federal student loans, provide states with grants that would help students graduate from community college debt-free, and crack down on predatory for-profit colleges.
Energy and Commerce
Frank Pallone
New Jersey
With jurisdiction over health care, energy, the environment and interstate business, the Energy and Commerce Committee looks over some of the most important planks of any party's agenda. For the Democrats and Mr. Pallone, 66, stabilizing the Affordable Care Act, lowering prescription drug costs and restoring environmental rules undone by Mr. Trump would top the list.
If Republicans still control the Senate, major Democratic priorities, like legislation addressing climate change, are probably headed nowhere. But Mr. Pallone, a member of the Progressive Caucus, could certainly raise the profile of his party's solutions and could use the committee for hearings into malfeasance in the private sector.
Mr. Pallone may try to work with Republicans to craft new regulations on how social media companies collect and use user data. He would also use the committee to apply pressure on the Federal Communications Commission and its decision to eliminate net neutrality rules.
Foreign Affairs
Eliot L. Engel
New York
The soft-spoken Mr. Engel, 71, hopes to be a counterbalance to Mr. Trump's unconventional foreign policy, and he could get an opportunity sooner than anticipated. After the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, the Trump administration is under intense pressure to punish one of the United States' closest Arab allies, and the president has said he would rather Congress take the lead. That could give a starring role to Mr. Engel, a lifelong resident of the Bronx whose unflagging support for Israel has occasionally put him at odds with his party.
Mr. Engel could also revive legislation he wrote to hold Russian actors responsible for interfering in the 2016 election and a resolution of inquiry seeking records from Mr. Trump's summit meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia earlier this year in Helsinki, Finland. And Democrats are eager to question the State Department on the potential targeting of career employees based on their politics.
Intelligence
Adam B. Schiff
California
The committee's divisive investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 election made its Democratic members some of the best-known names in Washington -- none more so than Mr. Schiff. But the meticulous former federal prosecutor from greater Los Angeles sees its work on the issue as far from done.
When Republicans concluded the Russia investigation in March having found no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, Mr. Schiff, 58, and committee Democrats put together a 98-page document detailing outstanding lines of inquiry. With subpoena power, he could chip away at those leads, compelling new testimony from witnesses that Republicans left unexplored.
"One of the issues that is of great concern to me is: Were the Russians laundering money through the Trump Organization," Mr. Schiff said in a recent interview. "That to me would be far more powerful kompromat than any video."
Mr. Schiff has said he will make restoring "comity" on the committee a priority after two years of intense partisan infighting.
Transportation and Infrastructure
Peter DeFazio
Oregon
Considered one of the last opportunities for bipartisanship action, infrastructure could be one of the first action items on the Democrats' to-do list, and the president may find an unlikely ally in Mr. DeFazio. The 71-year-old chairman-in-waiting has signaled his willingness to work with Mr. Trump, and the president himself has publicly mused that there's "a chance" House Democrats and he will "get along and get along well."
Democrats' proposed infrastructure plan is a sprawling $1 trillion package that would rebuild roads, bridges, water pipes and rural areas' broadband networks. Mr. DeFazio has proposed generating more revenue by raising the gas tax and indexing it to inflation.
Ways and Means
Richard E. Neal
Massachusetts
The powerful Ways and Means Committee writes tax law, signs off on trade deals, and oversees Social Security and Medicare. Mr. Neal, an institutionally minded western Massachusetts Democrat, wants to make serious policy pushes in almost all of those areas.
First Mr. Neal, 69, would lead the committee's consideration of the revised North American Free Trade Agreement. Mr. Neal voted against the original Nafta agreement, and his opposition to the deal could hobble efforts to sign it into law quickly. Mr. Neal was a vocal opponent of Republicans' latest tax cuts and would convene hearings on the law's effects. He and committee Democrats also would play a key role in the party's attempts to stabilize the Affordable Care Act, address high prescription drug costs, negotiate a potential infrastructure investment bill with Mr. Trump and pass legislation requiring all but the smallest employers to provide 401(k) retirement plans.
Mr. Neal also would have at his disposal an obscure provision in the federal tax code that allows the leaders of Congress's tax-writing committees to request and investigate the tax returns of any American, including the president.

U.S. Economy Stays Red-Hot, But Chill Lurks

Full text: The American economy barreled ahead in the third quarter as consumers stepped up and spent more, keeping it on track for the best annual performance since 2005. The government said on Friday that the economy expanded at an annualized rate of 3.5 percent between July and September after the 4.2 percent pace in the previous quarter. But there were signs that the growth could cool in the coming months.
Businesses remain hesitant to increase spending, despite the large corporate tax cut enacted late last year. Some of the gains were also one-offs that could fade quickly, like the restocking of shelves at stores and warehouses, which contributed more than half of the overall growth.
If there is a slowdown in the economy, it could further unsettle the markets, which have slumped in recent weeks. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 1.7 percent on Friday and is down nearly 9 percent for the month.
"Clearly a strong headline, but the details are a little less robust," said Michelle Meyer, who leads United States economics at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Still, with 10 days to go before the midterm election, the headline number will be a valuable talking point for Republicans on the campaign trail. The second and third quarters represented the strongest back-to-back growth since 2014, and Republican leaders were quick to claim credit.
"Americans have more opportunity and more money in their pockets today than they did two years ago, and that's in large part due to the reforms we've pushed forward," said Representative Erik Paulsen, a Minnesota Republican who is chairman of the Joint Economic Committee and is in a tight race for re-election, according to recent polls.
Tax cuts for individuals and the budget deal early this year, which raised federal spending, helped elevate growth in the third quarter. Consumer spending increased 4 percent, and federal outlays rose 3.3 percent.
"There will come a day of reckoning for the economy after the money from the tax cuts is all gone," said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank, "but for today Washington really has something to crow about."
The effect of the corporate tax cut was less evident. Businesses did not ramp up investment in equipment and factories -- the kinds of things executives do when they anticipate the good times to continue.
"You really lean back in your chair and wonder whether this enormous tax cut that was given to corporations only lasted three months," said Torsten Slok, chief international economist at Deutsche Bank. "The economics textbook would say that if you give a tax cut that lasts several years, you should see the effects for several years."
Looking ahead, Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays, said that he was not expecting a big rebound in business spending and that "if you're banking on strong G.D.P. growth, you need business investment."
Another wild card is the effect from one of President Trump's signature economic moves: increasing tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese imports. The president has also raised tariffs on imports from around the world, including on steel, aluminum and solar panels. So far, there is little evidence that those trade policies have hurt growth much.
A surge in soybean purchases by buyers seeking to act before retaliatory Chinese tariffs kicked in helped lift gross domestic product in the second quarter. But that uptick reversed itself in the third quarter.
"One interpretation of the data is that the trade war is not having the intended effect of boosting exports and lowering imports," Mr. Slok said. "Another interpretation is that the trade war can't do much about that. If the consumer spends more, you will have more imports."
Trip Tollison, chief executive of the Savannah Economic Development Authority in Georgia, said that shipping volume at the Port of Savannah was up 12 percent from a year ago and that there were almost no vacancies in the industrial real estate market. Warehouses and logistics companies have been among the most active businesses in the area.
"We're in a great spot, no complaints for sure," Mr. Tollison said. "We've got a very strong economy right now."
The latest data could increase the likelihood that policymakers at the Federal Reserve will continue to gradually raise interest rates, in order to prevent the economy from overheating and to head off inflation. The Fed is expected to raise rates one more time this year, in December, and several times in 2019.
That has irked Mr. Trump, who criticized the chairman of the Fed, Jerome H. Powell, on Tuesday. "Every time we do something great, he raises the interest rates," the president said.
Officials at the Fed, who do not report to the president, consider themselves above politics. Mr. Trump's attack is highly unusual.
The steady increase in borrowing costs is already being felt in the housing market. Residential investment slid 4 percent in the third quarter, and has fallen in five of the last six quarters.
Rising interest rates also put downward pressure on stocks. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note has been climbing, which makes riskier stocks less appealing to investors than safer bonds.
"We can only think investors are already looking ahead to economic conditions next year when the fiscal stimulus boost starts to fade," Mr. Rupkey of MUFG Union Bank said. "For the stock market, the economy's as good as it gets, and after buying the rumors, they are selling the fact."
Wall Street's recent decline, which began in early October, came too late to affect sentiment or spending in the third quarter. But on Main Street, consumers do have plenty to cheer. Unemployment in September stood at 3.7 percent, the lowest in nearly half a century, and wages are finally rising.
In Chicago, Avant, an online consumer lender with 600 employees, is planning to hire 400 more people by the end of 2019. The company specializes in lending to families earning between $40,000 and $100,000 for things like debt consolidation, auto repairs and medical bills. It also sells online lending technology to banks.
"Consumers today are in great shape," said Al Goldstein, Avant's chief executive. Injecting a note of caution, he added that "if interest rates continue to rise, that may change."

Here's What We Baby Boomers Owe Our Kids

Full text: STANFORD, Calif. -- I'm a 65-year-old member of the Me Generation. I'm writing to people my age and older about the iGeneration -- those under 25, often called Generation Z. Many of them worry about their futures and could use help. If we're to avoid living down to our self-centered nickname, our post-65 narrative must change. A half-century ago, many of us grew up expecting to work hard and quit at 65, or sooner. With decent pensions and government benefits, we would live on the golf course or the beach for 10, maybe 20 years.
Many of us are retiring before 65 or not returning to work after our children leave. But now many of us will live into our late 80s and 90s. Since we were as young as the iGen is now, average life expectancy in America has risen more than five years, and higher for the most affluent. One reason is Medicare, covering Americans over 65 or disabled.
Now that doctors keep us alive longer, we're costing far more than our parents and grandparents did. Annual health spending -- $2,200 per American in 1970 when we were their age -- almost quintupled to more than $10,000 in 2016, after inflation, according to the National Health Expenditure Accounts.
What should bother the iGen is that 50 years ago this money might have gone to improving schools or roads or safety, or to fighting climate change.
I even wonder whether increased Medicare spending is partly responsible for the election of Donald Trump, whose margin of victory came from voters in our generation. Without that spending, might enough of us have died sooner and tipped the balance in favor of Hillary Clinton?
My generation will say we paid into the system for decades and deserve our entitlements. But the one-earner baby boomer couple my age who have earned the average wage every year have paid less than $100,000 in Medicare taxes but are taking out benefits worth more than $400,000, after adjusting for inflation, according to C. Eugene Steuerle, a former Treasury official now at the Urban Institute.
He also found that the couple will receive half a million dollars in Social Security after paying in little more than a quarter million.
And when generations are compared, a declining number of young people are available to support a rising tide of retiring baby boomers, even as employers cut benefits, particularly for younger workers.
What should we older folks do?
First, those who remain healthy must stay productive -- preferably in ways that help young people. In my case, I created a teaching job that pays me health insurance, so that even as I still contribute to Medicare, I don't draw benefits.
Some of us can't work full time. But we -- especially the comfortable, like many my age here in Silicon Valley -- could volunteer in programs that benefit children. One woman I know began coaching students, many from immigrant families, on their writing. A college classmate is overseeing and financing the San Francisco high school that educated him and that now teaches low-income students. Another classmate is reviving an athletic competition for Los Angeles children.
Second, those of us with savings can donate to causes that benefit the young, including through our wills. Baby boomers sit on many trillions in assets. By diverting some to such causes, we could have a big effect. Two of my former business students have created a company, Freewill, that encourages us to create wills and leave money to worthy causes. A 69-year-old retired businessman in Houston left 20 percent of his $2 million estate to the Boys & Girls Clubs of America. By contrast, many baby boomers, even affluent ones, have no will, and only about 5 percent leave money to charity, Freewill reports.
Two other students are creating a business that matches volunteers with people who pay for services with a contribution to charity. We could volunteer, or we could hire those volunteers. Yet another former student has created a kind of Common App for scholarships, making it far easier for youths to apply and much simpler for donors to create them.
Third, we can create a living will and make clear we don't want expensive medical care when it won't make a difference.
At Stanford's commencement last June, the actor Sterling K. Brown, halfway between our generations, laid out for the iGen a mission that should be the Me Gen's too. "My mama always told me, 'When you visit someone else's house, leave things better than the way you found them,"' he said. "'That way, you'll always be asked back."'
The singer Sheena Easton might describe our mission another way: less takin' and more givin'.
Talking with hundreds of students has brought home how worried our children and grandchildren are about climate change, inequality and the shrinking role of government in helping needy people.
I tell them about the political system in which we in the Me Generation grew up. In the mid-1960s, Republicans and Democrats of my parents' and grandparents' generations created Medicare, Medicaid, the Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act, immigration reform, education reform, the Highway Safety Act, the Wilderness Act, cleaner air and water, public broadcasting and much more.
Our generation has failed at anything close to that. But such magic is possible. Remind your children and grandchildren of that. Tell them it starts with voting, for candidates who will represent their interests. Urge them to make it happen. And help them.

Full text: The stock market drop in October has been unsettling for anyone with a portfolio, particularly after a 3 percent plunge Wednesday that wiped out the year's gains. Could this be the beginning of a larger crash, or a recession? Well sure, it could. But even before accounting for the moderate rebound in markets Thursday morning, it makes more sense to view this sell-off differently. This isn't a crash, it's a reset. The economy is shifting in ways that aren't bullish for stock prices in the years ahead, but signal mostly good news for the economy and for ordinary people trying to make a living.
The bull market that will turn 10 years old early next year has, for most of its run, been a total dream for stock investors.
Economic growth in the United States has been steady, but growth worldwide has been slow -- which has kept interest rates low, making stocks a more compelling investment than cash or bonds in comparison.
Weak growth and high unemployment meant companies faced little pressure to pay more for their inputs, including both labor and raw materials. If a worker demanded a raise or a supplier threatened a price increase, there were plenty of alternatives.
Late in this bull market, the Trump administration made its signature domestic policy initiative a steep cut in corporate tax rates, which flows through directly into higher after-tax profits for shareholders.
Those three factors together were enough to propel the Standard & Poor's 500 up more than 300 percent from its March 2009 low to its recent high in September. But now, all three are shifting.
The economy is now heating up enough that interest rates are rising to more normal levels. Part of that is a result of Federal Reserve rate increases aimed at preventing the economy from overheating and from having excess inflation break out, a policy that President Trump has attacked.
But it's not just the Fed. Even longer-term interest rates that the Fed does not directly control have risen substantially in the last year, as have longer-term rates in other countries. British, German and Japanese bond yields are all up over the same span.
If you look at the stock market only in terms of its valuation -- how much you have to spend to buy shares for each dollar of corporate earnings you are capturing -- the stock market drop in recent weeks can be explained in significant part by the rise in longer-term rates in the same period.
If you look at the price-earnings ratio of the S.&P. 500 stocks, for example, and invert it to view it as the earnings-to-price ratio, it was 4.77 percent on Sept 1, meaning buying $100 bought you $4.77 worth of corporate profits. After the stock drop, that had risen to 5.23 percent.
The jump closely parallels the rise in longer-term bond yields, which, again, are mostly driven by an improving growth outlook. The yield on 10-year Treasury bonds has risen to 3.13 percent from 2.85 percent in that same span.
Higher interest rates have made bonds more attractive, and it makes perfect sense that investors would demand a more favorable valuation from stocks given that alternative.
The story might be different if investors believed that higher growth would feed disproportionately into higher corporate profits. But the current economic moment offers plenty of reason to think it won't.
Earlier in the expansion, there might have been lots of workers on the sidelines, and companies had leverage with their suppliers. But there are signs that is changing, like recent comments by 3M and Caterpillar that their input costs were rising, which helped kick off the recent bout of market weakness.
This is bad news for stocks and for the bottom lines of the largest companies, but good news for American workers. When you hear a phrase on a corporate call like "input costs are rising," keep in mind that the wages you receive are one of those costs.
Finally, while the first big economic initiative of the Trump administration, the tax cuts, was an unquestionable boon for stocks, the focus this year has been on a trade war, especially with China.
So far, the scale of the tariffs hasn't been big enough to have much impact on overall economic growth. But there has been a direct bottom-line impact for particular blue-chip companies that make goods using steel or aluminum (prices of which have spiked because of tariffs) or that import key parts from China.
As companies try to reroute supply chains or absorb higher costs to avoid raising prices on consumers, the trade war may have a much larger effect on the bottom lines of major industrial companies, and hence on their stock prices, than it does for ordinary consumers.
Put it together, and the stock market tumble of the last few weeks is not a mystery to be solved, nor a warning of horrible things to come, so much as an inevitable result of the economic expansion reaching a more mature stage.
The stock market looks forward, not back -- share prices are determined by what investors think the future looks like. And the economic future is starting to look quite different from the past.

Worries Add Up As Stocks Plunge

Full text: Another wave of selling hit the nearly decade-long bull market as investors worried that the ideal climate they have long enjoyed -- a surging economy, low interest rates and fast-growing corporate profits -- would soon be behind them. The benchmark Standard & Poor's 500-stock index shed 3 percent on Wednesday, wiping out its gains for the year. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index was down 4.4 percent, and has fallen more than 12 percent since early September.
Markets in Japan, China and Hong Kong matched Wall Street's drop on Thursday morning trading. It one potentially positive sign, futures markets that track the performance of stocks in the United States rose, suggesting investor attitudes might brighten when Wall Street opens.
Just over a month ago, the S.&P. 500 was up nearly 10 percent for 2018, with expectations that coming quarterly corporate earnings reports -- juiced by a generous tax cut and strong economic growth -- would keep sending stock prices upward.
It hasn't worked out that way.
Instead of celebrating quarterly profit and sales numbers that have largely lived up to expectations, investors have zeroed in on potential risks to the economic and corporate profit outlook for the coming year. Rising commodity costs tied to tariffs on imports, expectations that the Federal Reserve will keep raising interest rates, and an economic slowdown in China could all start to bite. And that's on top of investors' anxiety about what the midterm elections could mean for their portfolios.
"It was kind of a market that was looking for a reason to have some money come out of it," said Tony Dwyer, chief market strategist with the brokerage firm Canaccord Genuity in New York. "And it found it."
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 608 points, or 2.4 percent, on Wednesday. And the Nasdaq has now fallen into correction territory -- a decline of more than 10 percent from an earlier peak, which indicates a drop that's more serious than a garden-variety slump. The S.&P. 500 is down to 2,656.10, more than 9 percent off its recent peak on Sept. 20, meaning it, too, is nearing a correction.
The sell-off has come as political discord has jumped with Election Day less than two weeks away. On Wednesday, the discovery of explosive packages sent to prominent Democrats, including former President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state, as well as CNN, added to an already tense environment.
Some market observers think that investors may be moving to the sidelines before what could be a very close and bitter election.
"I think people just want to clear the decks and get the heck out before the midterm elections, frankly," said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank.
President Trump has repeatedly cited the strong performance of the stock market as evidence of the success of his administration's business-friendly approach. And as the market has slid lately, he has ratcheted up his criticism of the Federal Reserve's plan to raise interest rates as economic growth remains strong.
Low interest rates have helped support economic growth and the stock market since the financial crisis 10 years ago. But with unemployment at a 49-year-low, the Fed is now raising interest rates, saying it wants to keep the economy from overheating, which could set off inflation. The Fed is expected to raise interest rates again at its next meeting in December.
The rise in interest rates has been particularly painful for some pockets of the markets. Shares of homebuilders are down more than 16 percent this month, as rising mortgage rates have made houses less affordable. Smaller companies -- which are heavily exposed to floating-rate debt -- have also been hurt by rising rates, which increases the cost of their debt payments. The Russell 2000 index of small-capitalization stocks has fallen more than 13 percent in October.
And the president's trade war with China has increasingly preoccupied the markets, analysts said. Official numbers released by Beijing last week showed China's economic growth has slowed to 6.5 percent, its lowest level since 2009.
The slowdown in China, the world's second-largest economy, could mean falling sales for American companies that export to that market. As large consumers of metal who have invested heavily to gain access to the Chinese auto market -- the world's largest -- carmakers are particularly vulnerable to such risks. On Wednesday, Ford cited weak sales in China for falling profits. Company officials said issues surrounding trade disputes -- including tariffs on imported steel and aluminum -- could cost Ford $1 billion this year.
"What is really happening here is that people are saying, 'We just don't know about trade. We don't know how that's going to hit the margins or the earnings streams next year,"' said Michael Purves, chief global strategist at the brokerage firm Weeden & Company.
Mr. Purves said investors were eager for a resolution to the trade dispute and nervous that it could escalate further.
"I think there is a game of chicken going on between Trump and the markets right now," he added.
On Wednesday, the market tumble snowballed over the course of the day. Technology companies that have driven big market gains were badly battered. Shares in the tech heavyweights Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook all fell more than 5 percent. Netflix fell more than 9 percent after a media report that Apple planned to announce a subscription television service that would go head-to-head with its streaming service.
The news wasn't all bad for tech. Later Wednesday, Microsoft reported results that exceeded analyst expectations, sending its shares higher in after-hours trading. And Tesla shares also rose in after-hours trading after the electric-car maker reported its first profit in two years.
More high-profile results from tech companies are due in the coming days. Google's parent company, Alphabet; Amazon; and Twitter are scheduled to report results on Thursday. And Facebook's earnings report on Tuesday will be of intense interest: The company's report last quarter sent its stock price diving, erasing more than $100 billion in shareholder wealth.

In Its Heyday, Sears Spread the Wealth. Companies Today Don't.

Full text: Half a century ago, a typical Sears salesman could walk out of the store at retirement with a nest egg worth well over a million in today's dollars, feathered with company stock. A warehouse worker hired now at Amazon who stays until retirement would leave with a fraction of that.
Much as Sears has declined in the intervening decades, so has the willingness of corporate America to share the rewards of success. Shareholders now come first and employees have been pushed to the back of the line.
This shift is broader than a single company's culture, reflecting deep changes in how business is now conducted in America. Winner-take-some has evolved into winner-take-most or -all, and in many cases publicly traded companies are concentrating wealth, not spreading it. Profit-sharing and pensions are a rarity among the rank-and-file, while top executives take home an increasing share of the spoils.
Amazon shareholders have benefited more than workers, but Sears, in its heyday, tried to serve both.
The company earmarked 10 percent of pretax earnings for a retirement plan for full-time employees and by the 1950s, the workers owned a quarter of Sears. By contrast, one man at Amazon, the founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos, owns 16 percent of the company and is ranked as the world's richest person.
Amazon, which changed how Americans shop much as Sears did in its prime, does not disclose what percentage of its stock is owned by employees.
But this month, Amazon stopped giving stock to hundreds of thousands of employees, even as it lifted its minimum hourly wage to $15. While the raise garnered headlines, the move to curb stock awards may ultimately be more significant.
Not only does it reverse what had been an unusually broad employee stock ownership program, Amazon's decision underscores how lower-paid employees across corporate America have been locked out of profit-sharing and stock grants.
"What's happened is that shareholders' interests have squeezed out other stakeholders," said Arthur C. Martinez, who ran Sears during the 1990s and was credited with a turnaround. "The mantra is shareholders above all else."
Decades ago, he said, "the people who produced or sold the product were more central than the people in the corporate suite. There was a different mind-set and it's linked to the larger issue of income inequality."
Not only was Sears's program generous, it was also remarkably egalitarian. Contributions were based on years of service, not rank, and the longest-serving workers received nearly $3 for every dollar they contributed. The company phased out the profit-sharing plan beginning in the 1970s. This month, after years of lackluster attempts at revival, the retailer filed for bankruptcy protection.
Sears was hardly alone in corporate America, said Prof. Joseph R. Blasi, who directs Rutgers's Institute for the Study of Employee Ownership and Profit Sharing.
Companies like Procter & Gamble, S.C. Johnson, Hallmark Cards and U.S. Steel all embraced profit-sharing and were part of a corporate movement to encourage the practice, he said.
Among some leading executives in the early to mid-20th century, Professor Blasi said, "there was a notion that wages were not enough and workers had a right to share in the fruits of their labor."
In the executive suite, however, profit-sharing still flourishes. While 68 percent of workers who earn more than $75,000 benefit from it, only 20 percent of workers earning less than $30,000 do, according to Professor Blasi. The decline of profit-sharing for the latter group has accelerated in recent years, with the median annual grant falling to $300 in 2014 from $921 in 2002.
There are Amazon employees who hold a lot of stock. Four out of the top five executives earned less than $175,000 each in annual salary in the last three years, but got tens of millions of dollars in stock.
By present-day standards, Amazon is relatively generous. In addition to 401(k)'s, full-time employees receive medical insurance and a week of paid vacation their first year.
Fifty years ago, Sears provided all of that plus a much larger annual retirement contribution. While the typical Amazon employee receives $680 from the company in a 401(k), the average Sears worker got the present-day equivalent of $2,744. Dividends on accumulated stock could add thousands annually.
The Sears approach was not without flaws. By putting much of its assets into company stock, it made workers even more exposed to their employer's fate. It also favored men over women, who lost out when they took time off or left earlier than male colleagues, according to Sanford Jacoby, a professor of management and public policy at University of California, Los Angeles.
Still, it was very popular with employees. "People were retiring with nice chunks of change," Professor Jacoby said. "People loved this fund and Sears was a wildly successful company."
If Amazon's 575,000 total employees owned the same proportion of their employer's stock as the Sears workers did in the 1950s, they would each own shares worth $381,000.
Until this month, Amazon had been awarding two shares a year to warehouse employees, worth about $3,500 at the current price. The loss of those grants will prevent employees from directly partaking in one of the greatest examples of wealth creation.
To make up for the lost stock grants, Amazon has provided raises of at least $1.25 an hour to employees who had been earning over $15, plus cash bonuses at five, 10, 15 and 20 years of employment. Employees can put 401(k) contributions into Amazon shares.
Several employees interviewed, who insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, expressed disappointment. Amazon should have saved the dollar and kept giving workers stock, said one warehouse employee in Baltimore.
Amazon insisted workers were not losing out. "The significant increase in hourly cash wages effective Nov. 1 more than compensates for the phaseout of incentive pay and future stock grants," said a company spokeswoman, Ashley Robinson.
But that approach could make workers feel less connected to Amazon's success, said Jeffrey D. Shulman, a professor of marketing at the University of Washington. "Going forward, it almost becomes a zero-sum game," he said. "Now when the company makes a decision, Amazon either puts money into the pockets of shareholders or employees."
The calculus was different at Sears, said Dan Fapp, a former communications executive who worked there from 1963 to 1999. "If the company did well and the stock went up, your account was worth more," he said.
"It was not unusual for people to have $250,000 to $350,000 when they retired in the 1960s and early 1970s," Mr. Fapp said. That's worth well over $1 million today after adjusting for inflation.
At stores, there were also opportunities for salespeople to increase their base salary through commissions. So-called Big Ticket Men, who sold more expensive goods, earned the equivalent of nearly $50,000 a year.
Stanley Hreneczko, 91, started working at the Sears in Troy, Mich., in 1965. He was a salesman in the appliances department -- selling stoves and refrigerators. Thanks to his generous pay and the corporate savings plan, Mr. Hreneczko bought a home in cash and took summer vacations to Arizona and Florida.
"It was like working in heaven," he said.
Even junior employees were well taken care of.
"Most of these people retired with a good pension," said Jon White, who worked at Sears for 38 years, most recently as a manager in a store in Lithonia, Ga., before retiring in 2008. "Most of them are comfortable for the most part -- cashiers, clerks, replenishers, all kinds of workers."
Even after Sears scaled back its profit-sharing plan, workers benefited from a pension plan that held a diverse portfolio of stocks and bonds and provided fixed payments based on their salaries and tenure at the company. With Sears in bankruptcy, the federal government is expected to guarantee some or most of those pension payments.
Unlike Sears, Amazon is growing rapidly and the company says it is working harder to increase opportunities for promotion from the warehouse floor into leadership positions.
But its warehouses are staffed primarily by legions of lower-paid hourly employees. Of more than 2,000 workers at its fulfillment center in Carteret, N.J., all but 230 earn less than $17 an hour, or about $35,000 a year. During a recent tour there, one worker, Julia Teran, said she had received six shares during her three years at the company.
"I keep it for my retirement," Ms. Teran, 58, said of her stock, which is worth more than $10,000. How does she feel about the end of stock grants? "Things change," she said with a half-smile.
Photograph Amazon gave Julia Teran stock now worth more than $10,000, a benefit that it has sharply curtailed. (PHOTOGRAPH BY DEMETRIUS FREEMAN FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES) (A17)

Full text: Turkey has furthered the cause of justice by refusing to let Saudi Arabia evade responsibility for the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, the Washington Post columnist.
The steady drip of reports from President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government-controlled news media over the past three weeks, exposing grisly details of the killing, has drawn the world's attention to the ruthlessness of the kingdom's young crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, even as the Trump administration gave every sign of longing to look away.
On Tuesday, Mr. Erdogan again drew the world's eyes to this atrocity by addressing the issue at length for the first time, in a speech to members of his party.
He described the killing as "premeditated murder" and laid out a chronology of what happened. He also demanded that the Saudis provide more details -- many questions remain unanswered -- and extradite the 18 suspects they detained to face justice in Turkey. And he suggested that Prince Mohammed or someone close to him had directed the assault, which took place at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul.
"On whose orders did those individuals go there?" Mr. Erdogan demanded.
Such an open challenge to Saudi Arabia, a regional power that has cultivated a close relationship with President Trump and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, is an audacious move. What does Mr. Erdogan hope to achieve?
It's unlikely that he is much moved by the killing of a journalist, given Mr. Erdogan's record for abusing journalists and restricting press freedoms. Last year, media freedom groups once again judged Turkey to be the world's worst offender for jailing reporters for their work.
If not press freedom, then what principles is Mr. Erdogan defending?
No doubt Mr. Erdogan is outraged that a foreign power committed such a brazen killing within Turkey's borders -- indeed, in Istanbul, the president's hometown. Saudi Arabia flew in a 15-man hit squad to carry out the crime, and Mr. Khashoggi's body is still missing.
And perhaps Mr. Erdogan sees an opportunity, as American officials and other experts have speculated, to use the murder to extort money from the Saudis to shore up Turkey's failing economy in exchange for eventually helping to shift the blame away from the Saudi regime. The Turkish lira has been falling steadily and inflation has been rising, squeezing Turkish workers and the government.
Though one hasn't materialized, some sort of Saudi-Turkish compromise to keep further details of the crime a secret remains a possibility, even though the full truth and accountability for the killers are what's needed. Gina Haspel, the C.I.A. director, was in Istanbul on Tuesday to be briefed on the case.
With Tuesday's speech, Mr. Erdogan has staked his personal reputation on the claim that the Saudi story -- that the killing was a result of a "rogue operation" or an impromptu brawl -- is a lie. (By day's end, even President Trump agreed the account was the "worst cover-up ever.")
Crucially, though, Mr. Erdogan didn't go nearly as far as he'd hinted he might. He pointed the finger at Prince Mohammed only indirectly, and he spoke respectfully of King Salman, the prince's father and the kingdom's ultimate ruler, a sign that he still hoped to avoid a complete break with Riyadh.
That could leave room for Turkey and Saudi Arabia to engineer a deal. "He's just bargaining and increasing the price," one diplomat said of Mr. Erdogan.
If Mr. Erdogan claims to possess the kind of evidence that has been reported -- an audio of the killing or other intelligence -- he could have the power to derail Prince Mohammed, Saudi Arabia's 33-year-old heir apparent. Even though the prince received a standing ovation at an economic conference on Riyadh on Tuesday, he is fast becoming a pariah and subject of palace intrigue.
In fact, that may be Mr. Erdogan's real objective. He almost certainly views the Khashoggi episode as a chance to kneecap a regional rival and advance his goal of making Turkey the dominant Sunni Muslim power. He harbors dreams of presiding over a renewed Ottoman Empire. While that might be feasible in terms of political influence, it's doubtful he could extend Turkey's territory to any significant degree, though he has moved troops into northern Syria to fight what he views as Kurdish separatists who endanger Turkey's borders.
Mr. Erdogan has supported groups like the Muslim Brotherhood, which advocates a populist brand of Islam that backed elections in Egypt and Tunisia; the Saudis call the Brotherhood a terrorist group and consider its form of governance a threat to their hereditary rule.
Mr. Erdogan also has links to Iran, Saudi Arabia's chief adversary, and to Qatar, which the kingdom and other Arab nations have boycotted over a political dispute. Over 15 years in power, Mr. Erdogan has steadily consolidated domestic control, jailing dissidents and crushing the independent media.
But he came into this crisis weakened. Turkey was brought to the point of economic distress and diplomatic isolation by Mr. Erdogan's mismanagement, brutish authoritarian ways, corruption and disregard for the rule of law.
His country was isolated from the United States, which imposed sanctions over the detention of an American evangelical pastor, who was released earlier this month, and from other NATO allies in Europe.
For all of Turkey's continuing troubles, Mr. Erdogan has now created an opening for improving relations with Mr. Trump and beginning to reverse its economic decline.
And by spotlighting Saudi Arabia as a murderous neighborhood bully, Mr. Erdogan is now in position to rally the Turkish people around a common enemy, the time-tested tool of the autocrat. He is very likely to emerge from this confrontation even stronger.

Full text: Paul Volcker, wearing a blue sweatsuit and black dress socks, stretched out on a recliner in the den of his Upper East Side apartment on a Sunday afternoon. His lanky 6-foot-7 frame extended beyond the end of the chair's leg rest. He added an ottoman to rest his feet. "I'm not good," said Mr. Volcker, 91, the former Federal Reserve chairman, who came to prominence after he used shockingly high interest rates to help end the runaway inflation of the late 1970s and early '80s. Long one of finance's wise men, he has been sick for several months.
But he would rather not talk about himself. Instead, Mr. Volcker wants to talk about the country, the economy and the government. And if he had seemed lethargic when I arrived, he turned lively in his laments: "We're in a hell of a mess in every direction," he said.
Hundreds of books surrounded Mr. Volcker -- filling shelves and piled high on virtually every flat surface -- as did pink pages of The Financial Times, folded into origami. "Respect for government, respect for the Supreme Court, respect for the president, it's all gone," he said. "Even respect for the Federal Reserve.
"And it's really bad. At least the military still has all the respect. But I don't know, how can you run a democracy when nobody believes in the leadership of the country?"
Before Mr. Volcker fell ill, he finished his memoir, "Keeping at It: The Quest for Sound Money and Good Government." The book was supposed to be published in late November, but given Mr. Volcker's health, its publisher, PublicAffairs, a unit of Hachette, moved its release up to Oct. 30.
"I had no intention of writing a book, but there was something that kind of was irritating me," he said. "I'm really worried about this governance thing."
The book, which Mr. Volcker wrote with Christine Harper, editor in chief of Bloomberg Markets, is a telling memoir about a man who not only redefined the role of Fed chairman but, after the financial crisis, conceived of a namesake rule that eliminated some of the most blatant risk-taking by Wall Street banks. The Volcker Rule, which was part of the Dodd-Frank regulatory legislation, is being chipped away at by Republicans, which doesn't sit well with him.
"There is no force on earth that can stand up effectively, year after year, against the thousands of individuals and hundreds of millions of dollars in the Washington swamp aimed at influencing the legislative and electoral process," he wrote in the book.
The memoir is at times a dishy tale of Mr. Volcker's years in Washington. For example, while President Trump has complained in recent months about the Fed's plan to raise interest rates, he isn't the first to try to influence the independent Federal Reserve. Mr. Volcker recounts being summoned to meet with President Ronald Reagan and his chief of staff, James Baker, in the president's library next to the Oval Office in 1984.
Reagan "didn't say a word," Mr. Volcker wrote. "Instead Baker delivered a message: 'The president is ordering you not to raise interest rates before the election."' Mr. Volcker wasn't planning to raise rates at the time.
"I was stunned," he wrote. "I later surmised that the library location had been chosen because, unlike the Oval Office, it probably lacked a taping system."
The book is not limited to tales of the past, however. It addresses current policy, like the 2 percent inflation target that has become the goal of the Federal Reserve.
"I puzzle at the rationale," he wrote. "A 2 percent target, or limit, was not in my textbook years ago. I know of no theoretical justification."
With a laugh, he told me that he believed the policy was driven by fears of deflation. "And we haven't had any deflation in this country for 90 years!"
But there is something more worrisome affecting policy than fear, he told me. Money.
Over the din of traffic outside an open window, Mr. Volcker hoarsely sounded an alarm on the power it has to shape our culture and our politics.
"The central issue is we're developing into a plutocracy," he told me. "We've got an enormous number of enormously rich people that have convinced themselves that they're rich because they're smart and constructive. And they don't like government, and they don't like to pay taxes."
Washington, when he arrived, "was a city filled with bureaucrats," he said. "It didn't make them bad." At the time, civil servants -- like his father, the township manager of Teaneck, N.J. -- were respected. "I grew up in a world in which good government was a good term," he said.
But things have changed. Today, he said, Washington is overrun by lobbyists and think tanks. Mr. Volcker, who started a nonprofit to improve education for public service, contends that our educational system has been perverted by money.
Schools like the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard and the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton, he said, have failed to educate a new generation of civil servants. He said they no longer taught governing but policy -- a shift that he contended allowed them to hold forums and discussions with generals and under secretaries.
"Rich guys," he said, "like to go." He called it "hobnobbing wholesale."
"They can argue war and peace and poverty and everything else," he said. "But when you go to a school of public policy, you're not learning how to run the goddamn government. You're learning how to debate political issues."
Unlike President Barack Obama, who invited Mr. Volcker to consult on economic and regulatory policy -- and asked him if he would be willing to be Treasury secretary, he said -- this White House hasn't called him. Even so, he has met Mr. Trump twice, both times before he took office.
The first meeting was after Mr. Volcker left the Federal Reserve in 1987. "I was walking down the street, somebody calls out: 'Hey, Paul! Hey, Paul!' He comes running across the street and says, 'Hi, I'm Donald Trump."'
The other was an unsuccessful attempt by Mr. Volcker to get Mr. Trump to use "The Apprentice" to raise money for a charitable organization. "We had a very nice lunch, and he said, 'Interesting idea,' but put me off otherwise," Mr. Volcker said.
Mr. Volcker is no great fan of the president, but he acknowledged that Mr. Trump had cannily recognized the economic worries of blue-collar workers. Mr. Trump "seized upon some issues that the elite had ignored," he said. "I don't think there's any question about that, in kind of an erratic way, but there it is."
He wondered how many lectures and presentations he had sat through with economists "telling us open markets are wonderful, everybody benefits from open markets."
Eventually, Mr. Volcker said, someone in those lectures would always ask, "What about that poor manufacturer in my town?" But that concern was dismissed too easily, with talk of worker retraining or some other solution far easier said than done.
Today, Mr. Volcker is already starting to worry about the next financial crisis. Asked about the stability of the banks, he said, "They're in a stronger position than they were, but the honest answer is I don't know how much they're manipulating."
That, he said, is the real challenge facing economic policymakers. "Everybody talks about monetary policy," he said, "but the lesson of all this is we need better, stronger supervisory powers."
Even as our conversation came to end, Mr. Volcker looked as if he could keep talking for hours. I told him that, rather than look sick or depressed about the state of the world, he appeared energized. Or, I told him, that was at least the impression he left.
"Leave it that way," he said.

Taking a Page From Airlines, Luxury Hotels Try Piling On Fees

Full text: Resort fees. The term conjures up a poolside lounge chair, thick towels piled high nearby. But starting about two years ago, urban luxury and full-service hotels across the United States have increasingly adopted the fees. They may be called amenities or facilities fees and cover less glamorous goods or services like internet access and bottled water. Depending on the hotel, they may be hard to find when a traveler is booking a room online.
But they are profitable for the hotels. Bjorn Hanson, an adjunct professor at the New York University School of Professional Studies Jonathan M. Tisch Center for Hospitality and Tourism, who has researched the fees, said that most of the fee cost goes directly to hotels' bottom lines.
Mr. Hanson projected that total fees and surcharges collected by hotels in the United States will reach a high of $2.93 billion this year, with another record projected in 2019. "The increase for 2018 reflects a combination of approximately 2.5 percent more occupied hotel rooms than in 2017, and 6 percent more fee and surcharge categories and higher amounts," he said.
Robert Mandelbaum, director of research information services for CBRE Hotels' Americas Research, said: "Resort fees are a very profitable way for hotels to raise revenue and not advertise they're raising room rates. By a strict definition, they're not raising room rates but adding a mandatory fee."
The Pierre Hotel in New York City, for instance, imposes a daily surcharge of $30 plus tax for services like high-speed internet access, unlimited local and domestic long-distance calls, bottled water and continental breakfast in the lobby. The $25 daily fee, which does not include tax, charged by the Sofitel Washington DC Lafayette Square includes amenities like premium internet access, access to a bike sharing program, bottled water and yoga classes.
According to the website ResortFeeChecker.com, as of July, 131 hotels in New York charged such a mandatory fee, 25 in Washington, 78 in Los Angeles and 47 in San Francisco.
Last year, Mr. Hanson said, 42 percent of resort hotels charged resort fees, a figure he predicted would remain flat this year. But he estimated that the percentage of urban hotels charging such fees would climb to 8 percent this year from 2 percent last year. He further estimated that the total amount of resort fees collected by urban hotels should climb by $110 million this year. And he said he expected the fees to spread to some second-tier cities and suburban markets next year.
Mr. Hanson said urban hotels' fees are determined and imposed by their local general managers and typically range from $20 to $40 per night, plus local sales tax.
Matt Arrants, executive vice president of Pinnacle Advisory Group, a hospitality consulting company, said urban hotels' fees are proliferating because "hotels can charge them and get them," adding, "People are willing to pay them and hotels consider them a value-add."
One reason guests are willing to pay them, he suggested, is that they have become accustomed to airlines imposing surcharges on everything from baggage checking to in-flight food. "The hotel industry is looking at the airline model and trying to increase revenue opportunities," he said.
"Although the U.S. hotel industry will have the highest occupancy rate in 2018 it has had since 1981, the room rate increase will be only 2.5 to 3 percent," Mr. Hanson said. "At the same time, there's a large increase in labor costs and real estate taxes and rising interest rates. Although occupancies can't go up much more, room rates in many cases are not covering the increased expenses. Hotels thus have an unusual incentive to find additional forms of revenue and profit." The fees are one way. He estimated that 80 to 90 percent of the fees generate profit for hotel owners.
Not surprisingly, travelers' reactions to resort fees charged by both urban hotels and resorts have been negative. Henry Harteveldt, president of Atmosphere Research, a travel research firm, said in a report this year: "Hotel guests flat-out hate resort fees. In our Q1 2018 survey of 3,656 U.S. hotel guests, 91 percent expressed dislike about resort fees. The remaining 9 percent were neutral. No one liked them. Travelers see resort fees for what they are: indirect rate hikes."
Another problem for travelers can be the transparency of urban hotels' fees, since hotels can be inconsistent in revealing fee details on their websites or on websites of online travel agencies. Fee information on smaller hotel booking websites, particularly those operated outside the United States, can be even more spotty.
FranÃ§ois-Olivier Luiggi, general manager of the Pierre, which is managed by Taj Hotels, said his hotel imposed its fee in January, when it upgraded its internet access.
"The customer is getting used to fees everywhere," he said. "We feel the fee is less than the combined value of our amenities."
"As a business," he added, "you try to increase your rate every day to match inflation at least, and to find new ways to grow revenue by offering a variety of services and products." He said that guest feedback to the fee has been "excellent," since "we fully disclose it."
A Hilton spokesman, Nigel Glennie, said three of its hotels, all in New York, were testing these fees, which he said were "clearly disclosed during the booking process" and offered guests "a bundle of amenities and services," including premium Wi-Fi, free local calls and a food and beverage voucher. A spokeswoman for IHG, Ada Hatzios, said "less than 3 percent of IHG-branded hotels in the Americas currently have a resort fee, and those that do disclose this to guests during the booking process." A Marriott spokeswoman, Kathleen Duffy, said 14 of its 76 hotels in New York have been testing fees since the summer of 2017. She also said amenities covered by the fees can vary by season. Hyatt, Mandarin Oriental and AccorHotels declined to comment.
Formal actions have been taken against the hotel industry because of the fees. In 2012, the Federal Trade Commission issued a warning letter to hotels that charged resort fees without including them in their advertised daily room rate. In 2016, Thomas Luca Jr., a Pennsylvania traveler who booked a room online at a Wyndham hotel in Miami, sued the company in Federal District Court in Pennsylvania, alleging misrepresentation of its room rates on its website. Last week, he asked that the case be certified as a class action. A Wyndham spokeswoman, Nadeen N. Ayala, said she could not comment on the suit "as it is the subject of pending litigation."
In 2017 the attorney general for the District of Columbia sued to enforce an investigative subpoena it served on Marriott International in connection with a national investigation involving its office and those of attorneys general in 46 states concerning "deceptive price advertising techniques used by the Marriott." All legal cases are pending.
"With record high occupancy levels, especially in major urban markets, the consumer does not have a lot of leverage" over hotels in contesting fees, Mr. Mandelbaum said.
A possible exception, Mr. Hanson said, could be business travelers whose trips are overseen by corporate travel managers, who he said have been contesting fees in negotiations with hotel companies, as have convention planners.
"It's buyer, beware," said Jan Freitag, senior vice president for lodging insights of STR, a hotel research company. "There are still a lot of urban hotels that do not assess the fees. It behooves travelers to do their research before their stay."
Robert Cole, a Dallas-based hotel consultant, warned travelers who book online to carefully study how and where fees are listed on hotel and online travel agency websites. If fees are not revealed at the beginning of the shopping process, a hotel may be inaccurately perceived as cheaper than others.
Longer term, Mr. Harteveldt warned, hotels' fee policies could make them vulnerable. "Home-sharing businesses, such as Airbnb, could also leverage their lack of resort fees," he said, "enabling them to steal more market share away from hotels."
"The Customer Is Getting Used to Fees Everywhere," Said FranÃ§Ois-Olivier Luiggi, General Manager of the Pierre Hotel in New York, Which On Top of Room Rates Charges $30 Plus Tax for Use of Amenities Like High-Speed Internet. (Photographs by Jeenah Moon for the New York Times)

Full text: The end of Robert Mueller's investigation. The loss of health insurance for several million people. New laws that make it harder to vote. More tax cuts for the rich. More damage to the environment. A Republican Party molded even more in the image of President Trump. These are among the plausible consequences if the Republicans sweep the midterm elections and keep control of both the House and Senate. And don't fool yourself. That outcome, although not the most likely one, remains possible. The last couple of weeks of polling have shown how it could happen.
Voters who lean Republican -- including whites across the South -- could set aside their disappointment with Trump and vote for Republican congressional candidates. Voters who lean left -- including Latinos and younger adults -- could turn out in low numbers, as they usually do in midterm elections. The Republicans' continuing efforts to suppress turnout could also swing a few close elections.
[ Listen to "The Argument" podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt. ]
No matter what, Democrats will probably win the popular vote in the House elections, for the first time since 2012. Trump, after all, remains unpopular. But the combination of gerrymandering and the concentration of Democratic voters in major cities means that a popular-vote win won't automatically translate into a House majority.
In the Senate, the election already seems to be slipping away from the Democrats. Several of this year's close Senate races happen to involve Democrats defending seats in red states. As a result, Republicans may expand their current 51-49 majority, making it easier for them to win close votes on legislation and nominations.
If Republicans do manage to keep both chambers of Congress, it would cause a political shock. So far, much of the speculation has focused on what a Democratic House takeover might mean -- attempts to rein in Trump's executive actions, subpoenas, investigations, maybe even impeachment. But it's important to understand that a Republican victory would also change Washington.
It would be validation for Trump, who could then brag that he had defied the experts once again. It would mean he had outperformed Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, Ronald Reagan, Lyndon Johnson and Harry Truman, all of whom suffered drubbings in the first midterm election of their presidency. It would embolden Trump to push even harder toward the America he wants -- where corporate oversight is scant, climate change is ignored, voting rights are abridged, health care is a privilege, judicial independence is a fiction and the truth is whatever he says it is.
I obviously find this prospect alarming. I'd much rather spend time imagining the ways the Congress could act as a check on Trump after the Democrats gain some control. And the polls say that's still likely. The political website FiveThirtyEight put the Democrats' odds at around 84 percent on Friday.
Yet all of us should have learned by now that there is a big difference between the unlikely and the impossible. Political polls are like weather forecasts or medical diagnoses. They are a much better guide to the future than random guesses, but they inevitably involve uncertainty. "84 percent" is not just a careful way of saying "100 percent." The Republican Party of Donald Trump really could win the midterms.
That's why I spent a good portion of this past week doing reporting about what two more years of unified Republican rule might look like. The following preview is based on those conversations.
The Russia investigation
Members of Congress don't usually turn against a scandal-marred president from their own party until they believe that supporting him jeopardizes their own careers. That fear helped lead Republicans to abandon Richard Nixon, at long last, in 1974. A lack of fear helps explain why Democrats stuck by Bill Clinton through his sex scandal.
For today's congressional Republicans, the election will be a measure of how worried they need to be about Trump and Russia. As Susan Hennessey of the Brookings Institution says, the midterms "are the last best hope for Republicans in Congress to grow a backbone." A Democratic takeover may make congressional Republicans less willing to make excuses for Trump. A Republican victory would suggest that the party does not need to be very scared about the politics of Russia.
Yes, Mueller -- the special counsel overseeing the investigation -- could change that by issuing an explosive report after the election. But a midterm victory could also give Trump the confidence to shut down the investigation, through firing some combination of Mueller, Rod Rosenstein (who oversees Mueller) and Jeff Sessions, the attorney general. In their place, he could install loyalists unconcerned with the quaint notion that no one is above the law. An expanded Senate majority could ease the confirmation of those loyalists.
Even if Mueller's findings eventually became public, an unfinished report is different from a completed investigation that could include indictments of people close to Trump. It's easy to imagine Trump waving it away as a "witch hunt." Congressional Republicans may go even further and hold hearings investigating the investigators -- the current and former law-enforcement officials whom Trump has unjustly blamed for the investigation.
Altogether, an election victory would probably give Trump the confidence to do what he has already signaled he wants to do: use the law as an instrument of political power rather than one of justice.
Health care
The Republican agenda on health care is deeply unpopular. It revolves around less insurance for the middle class and poor, to pay for tax cuts. In response, many Republicans have begun telling flat-out falsehoods about their positions on health care.
Now imagine if the party nonetheless won the midterms. "They will have learned a very specific lesson," Jacob Leibenluft of the liberal Center for American Progress said. "They can get away with lying about what their actual policy is."
There is every reason to believe Republicans would then try to cut health care funding more deeply. People in Republican circles told me that they did not anticipate a new attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act. "I would expect them to make some kind of run on health care again," Ryan Streeter of the conservative American Enterprise Institute said, "but I would be surprised if they tried for full repeal." Douglas Holtz-Eakin of the American Action Forum called repeal "a political rallying cry" and "not a legislative agenda."
I'm not so sure. Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, suggested on Wednesday that Republicans would reconsider repeal if they kept Congress. Last year, it failed by only a single vote in the Senate -- the vote of John McCain, who has since died.
"We should always assume that as soon as they have the votes, they will repeal the rest of the A.C.A.," said Andy Slavitt, who ran Medicare and Medicaid under Obama. Even if they don't, Slavitt added, they will probably make other cuts. Medicaid -- which serves the poor, working class, disabled and elderly -- is a likely target.
Other legislation
For decades now, the No. 1 Republican policy priority has been tax cuts that mostly benefit the rich. The only major piece of legislation signed by Trump was such a tax cut. Next year, there could be more cuts. One possibility would be the repeal of the estate tax, which applies to only a tiny fraction of the wealthiest households, said Jeffrey Miron of Harvard and the Cato Institute. Another possibility would be a technical change in inflation measurement, resulting in a large cut in investment taxes.
Apart from taxes, the party could try to go further to block corporate regulation. Right now, regulation tends to swing back and forth, depending on who holds the White House, but some congressional Republicans want to change that. They support a bill that would constrain future presidents from imposing regulations, in the name of reducing consumer costs. Liberal analysts have nicknamed it the "License to Kill Bill," citing its effects on pollution, consumer safety and worker safety.
The most tempting Republican legislation may be one that involves political power rather than any specific policy area. Over the past decade, the party has become much more aggressive about restricting voting access, especially for Democratic-leaning groups like African-Americans and Native Americans. So far, these laws have been passed in states, rather than at federal level. But Myrna PÃ©rez of the Brennan Center for Justice told me that she was worried that the state laws -- like those requiring new forms of identification or reducing voting hours and polling places -- could become a model for a federal law.
The goal would be as obvious as it is nefarious: Keep Republicans in power, even when they lack the support of most Americans.
The list here is clearly speculative, and not comprehensive. A Republican sweep would also ease the confirmation of federal judges, and it might encourage still harsher treatment of immigrants. Beyond any specific piece of legislation, though, a Republican victory would send a message. It would be an endorsement (albeit a flawed one, probably based on a popular-vote loss) of Trump's vision for America.
In that America, congenital liars and sexual harassers don't get punished. They can become president. In that America, people with dark skin aren't guaranteed the same rights as people with white skin, and a violently warming planet is less important than corporate profits. In that America, the federal government protects the wealthy and powerful, often at the expense of everyone else.
By now, no one should have any illusions about how Trump will behave if he faces no restraints.

Full text: A few years ago, a senior Japanese central banker let me in on a secret side of his life: Like some others in his rarefied world, he is a passionate devotee of Sherlock Holmes. After formal meetings in capitals around the world, he joins the other Sherlock Holmes buffs over drinks or dinner for trivia competitions, to test their knowledge of obscure plot details, or to share amateur historical research into Victorian London. It is all very casual, but the camaraderie is important to him. Through this informal fan club, the banker told me, he had made his closest professional friendships. "I feel closer to many of these people than to many of my countrymen," he said.
As an anthropologist, I have spent 20 years studying the customs, beliefs and rituals of central bankers around the world. They see themselves as jacks-of-all-financial-trades who solve complex financial crises before they can damage the unsuspecting public. They are as clever as the extraordinarily wealthy banking executives whom they regulate, but motivated by higher ideals. So it made sense that the aloof and justifiably arrogant Sherlock Holmes might represent for them an ideal of masculine brilliance (they are mostly still men), rationality and self-control. Like Holmes, central bankers consider their detachment an asset.
But in the real world, this high-mindedness has come at a cost. In the United States, President Trump has suggested that the Federal Reserve is not doing "what's good for the country," and on Tuesday he told Fox Business that the Fed was his "biggest threat." He said that it was "raising rates too fast, and it's too independent." So far, the Fed chairman has remained above the political fray. But if the president persuades enough Americans that the Fed's decisions to raise interest rates, which would make their credit cards and mortgages more expensive, are to blame for their financial troubles, principled silence may not be enough.
The acculturation process for central bankers begins early. Most of them attend a handful of elite universities -- the University of Chicago, Harvard, Yale, Oxford, Cambridge -- to study neoclassical economics, and their early training often involves a secondment to the central banking institutions of another country. In Tokyo or Frankfurt or New York, they operate within a closed set.
There are norms of dress: sharp, conservative suits and dark ties, but never fancy shoes. (Janet Yellen's decision to remove her jacket at a summertime meeting once caused a stir.) And many central bankers date their lives according to memories of certain key international banking agreements: Basel I and Basel II are, for them, like the fall of the Berlin Wall or the Sept. 11 attacks.
This world is beginning to feel like an anachronism, especially after the financial crisis of 2008. When markets fail to respond to monetary policy as the science says that they should, the public loses faith in experts. And it may not be possible for the informal and secretive craft of central banking to continue its traditions in a world that demands greater transparency and accountability. This tradition of the apolitical central banker isn't even very well established. It goes back only to the late 1980s and early 1990s, when a flurry of academic research suggested that independent central banks were correlated with lower inflation -- a priority at the time for the United States.
In response to criticism, many central banks are trying to diversify their work forces and share more details about the deliberations of their monetary policy committees.
But these steps have been far too modest. Central banks should think more boldly about diversity, by welcoming not just more women and people of color, but also more people with real-world economic and business expertise, rather than only Ph.D.s. Central bankers already meet regularly with academics and financial institutions such as Goldman Sachs. Why not also meet with civil society groups that critique their work?
Central bankers should also consider the divisions in their own elite world. At one closed-door meeting that I organized, a central banker from South Asia complained to the ones from the United States and Europe, in essence: You guys meet the night before at your private club, and then you show up here, and the decisions have already been made.
The man he was challenging wasn't embarrassed. Instead, he said, in effect: Well, if you could just learn to play by the rules, then you could be part of that club. Look at the Japanese. They've learned all the rules, and now look where they are.
This arrogance, toward the public and even toward one another, undermines central banks' effectiveness. One of the goals of monetary policy is to shape people's behavior. When a central bank says it anticipates that prices are going to rise, it expects the public to take that advice seriously. If people do, and they buy things now before prices rise, then perhaps prices won't rise as much. But central banks need credibility for this stabilizing mechanism to work.
Some countries do have this level of public trust, built carefully over decades. In Denmark, for example, central bank officials make a concerted effort, in speeches and other public comments, to tell the story of how their work contributes to the egalitarian society that Danes value. Danes love their central bank.
There are still, of course, central bankers who argue that they should preserve their mystique or people won't respect them. Others believe that close ties among central bank officials benefit everyone: The 2008 crisis, for example, might have been much worse if they did not have such open lines of communications. One central banker I know, from one of the Group of 7 countries, spoke movingly about how much he valued his deep personal relationships with leaders at the People's Bank of China. He said both sides shared quite sensitive information and did whatever they could, within the boundaries of their professional obligations, to support one another.
In an era of increasing economic nationalism, this cosmopolitan culture may be difficult to maintain.
Holmes never worried about this sort of thing. In "A Study in Scarlet," upon being told that the earth in fact revolves around the sun, Holmes declares, "What the deuce is it to me?" Dr. Watson is shocked, but Holmes insists, "If we went round the moon it would not make a pennyworth of difference to me or my work." His central banking acolytes may not be so lucky.
