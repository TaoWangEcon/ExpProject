Abstract: "Revenues are definitely improving, but it's just unsure where it's going to head from here," said Todd Haggerty, an analyst with the National Conference of State Legislatures, who noted that although revenues in many states have not returned to pre-recession levels, 17 states exceeded their expected personal income tax collections in the first quarter of the current budget year, and 18 states got more in sales tax than they had anticipated.

Full text: Over most of the past decade, budget deliberations in Michigan have taken on a glum and familiar monotony: What do we cut now?
But the state that experienced an economic downturn earlier, deeper and longer than most of the rest of the country has made an unlikely discovery as its officials closed out its latest financial books: Michigan has a $457 million surplus.
Even more surprising: Revenues, which had sunk or had been mostly flat for all but one year since 2000, have grown. Not a lot, but grown.
Michigan is the most unlikely example of a phenomenon that was unimaginable in most states in recent years. Though nearly all states are required by law to balance their budgets, most have been able to do so only through rounds of painful spending cuts to make up for deep shortfalls in revenue.
Now, however, as a majority of states have begun collecting tax revenues that are on par with or even above expectations, they face some measure of Michigan's situation -- trying to sort out whether the worst is really over, whether it is safe to start spending again, or whether a rainy day fund may be the prudent course.
"Revenues are definitely improving, but it's just unsure where it's going to head from here," said Todd Haggerty, an analyst with the National Conference of State Legislatures, who noted that although revenues in many states have not returned to pre-recession levels, 17 states exceeded their expected personal income tax collections in the first quarter of the current budget year, and 18 states got more in sales tax than they had anticipated.
Even the federal government has seen an encouraging boost in revenues. After declining sharply (17 percent) in the 2009 fiscal year and rising only 3 percent in 2010, federal revenues rose 6 percent in 2011, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
In Michigan, a state that has cut so much so often that in the words of a former state budget director, "we were so far down that the floor looked like up to us," nearly everyone is now clamoring desperately for a piece of the extra cash. As Gov. Rick Snyder, a first-term Republican, prepared to propose a new budget on Thursday, he and his budget team were hearing from seemingly every imaginable department, agency and interest group.
The attorney general wants 1,000 new police officers after 3,200 were cut around the state over the last decade. Schools leaders say they need to offset cutbacks that have left teachers laid off and schools closed. Child advocates want money for early education for toddlers from poor families; construction workers want money for Michigan's crumbling roads; and on and on.
For years in Michigan, the only certainty seemed to be a vanishing state budget. The auto manufacturing industry, so central to the state's existence, was believed to be fading, then collapsing. At various times, Michigan officials had to offset more than $10 billion in expected shortfalls -- closing prisons, eliminating state departments and cutting funds to libraries, day care programs, crime laboratories, zoos and more. By 2010, Robert L. Emerson, the budget director under Gov. Jennifer M. Granholm, a two-term Democrat who preceded Mr. Snyder, said he found himself working with general fund revenues that had dropped to levels last seen in the early 1990s (or the 1960s, when adjusted for inflation).
While the state had closed the books in the black in some previous years, too, its surpluses on paper were often instantly overtaken by larger projected deficits for the year ahead. Lately, though, signs have shifted. Manufacturing jobs, often declared dead by frustrated workers, have picked up. United States automakers have increased production, saying sales are up, and General Motors, only a few years after a federal rescue and bankruptcy, recaptured in 2011 a crown some thought was merely a dusty memory -- that of the world's largest automaker.
In part, as a result, the unemployment rate in Michigan, which reached 14.1 percent in 2009 and had regularly been among the worst several states in the nation, has lately been among states showing the most significant and continuing rates of improvement, though at 9.3 percent in December it is still above the national average.
By the close of the state's 2011 budget year, in September, Michigan had collected $8.8 billion in general fund revenues -- more than $1 billion less the amount collected in, say, 2000, but noticeably up from the $7.6 billion in Michigan's coffers in 2010, thanks to growth in state income and sales tax revenues. Officials are now projecting $632 million more in revenues over the next two years than they had been expecting.
"After a decade of declining revenues, it's pretty doggone good news," John E. Nixon, Mr. Snyder's state budget director, said in an interview. "Things have turned."
The state's economic growth comes even as its largest city, Detroit, is in financial turmoil. While city officials are scrambling to avoid running out of money this year, a state review team is expected to decide soon whether the city requires an outside financial manager to take control. Detroit's circumstances are somewhat unusual, but cities generally may revive at a slower rate than states, since they depend largely on property taxes, still stalled in many places.
Mr. Nixon attributed the improved state budget outlook to the state's broader economic uptick, but also, in part, to tax and policy changes Governor Snyder pressed. The state replaced a business tax with a corporate income tax that is expected to save businesses $1.5 billion a year, though that change did not take effect until January.
To make up lost dollars, lawmakers agreed to tax public workers' pensions, reduce the state's Earned Income Tax Credit for the working poor, and remove or reduce other tax exemptions and deductions -- moves Mr. Snyder's critics point to as evidence that even if Michigan's businesses start feeling better, its ordinary families may feel worse.
"A lot of people want us to backfill the cuts we made last year, and we're not doing that," Mr. Nixon said. "We're not going to have a record recovery here -- we're going to have a long, drawn-out recovery."
The prospect of now building up some savings cushion came as unwelcome news to people like Peter Spadafore, of the Michigan Association of School Boards, who said the schools, drastically cut last year, were in desperate need. "If you're talking about putting it in a rainy day fund, it's raining," he said.
But others seemed reluctant to start thinking about buying things again. Not yet. "Now is not the time to start throwing more money at program areas that haven't necessarily gone through the real reform that they need to," said Tricia Kinley, an official from the Michigan Chamber of Commerce. "While our members have a confidence and renewed optimism, we've also seen a decade of real turmoil in our state."

Full text: Iran's top leaders displayed a public mix of bravado and defiance on Wednesday in the face of the West's tightened antinuclear sanctions, using the impending 33rd anniversary of the Islamic Revolution to denounce the United States, the European Union and Israel as colonialist bullies.
But beneath the bombast, strains on Iran's economy from the sanctions showed further signs of deepening, with the government looking for ways to avoid the use of dollars in international oil trade, new reports of problems importing food, and a Gallup poll that suggested a majority of Iranians were worried about financial pain from the penalties already imposed.
Statements by Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and the speaker of Parliament, Ali Larijani, who some believe could become the next president of Iran, all echoed themes of Iranian self-reliance and resentment toward the West in advance of the anniversary this Saturday of the 1979 revolution that toppled the shah.
Iran's Fars News Agency reported that Mr. Ahmadinejad, in a speech to an Islamic conference in Tehran, called the West's version of democracy "the humiliation of mankind because it is only serving the interests of capitalists and Zionists in the name of the people."
Fars quoted Mr. Larijani as saying Iran's enemies "aim to weaken the revolutionary people and promote the spirit of their puppet rulers." Ayatollah Khamenei, in a speech to air force members, called Iran the model for the uprisings elsewhere in the Middle East and proof that "the Islamic Revolution has flourished and is dynamically moving forward."
Their statements did not address the latest pain from shortages, inflation and a plunging currency, which come less than four weeks before Iran's parliamentary election. Some of Iran's new problems appeared to reflect the impact of the latest sanctions leveled by the United States and Europe, which are aimed at Iran's financial system and oil industry, even before they take full effect later this year.
The semiofficial Mehr news agency reported, for example, that Iran is discussing with China a way to find a substitute for dollars as payment for Chinese purchases of crude oil from Iran, a major supplier. Reuters reported that Malaysian exports of palm oil, critical to Iran's food industry, had been halted because sellers were not getting paid. The development followed accounts that Iran had been unable to pay for rice supplies from India and that Ukrainian wheat exporters had halved their shipments to Iran because of payment problems.
Iranian leaders have sought to portray the sanctions as psychological warfare by the United States and European Union, and have exhorted Iran's 74 million people to show stoicism. In his first public address of the year, Ayatollah Khamenei said Friday that the country had a history of withstanding acute deprivations, notably the eight-year Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s, that were far worse.
But some Iranian historians say that the ayatollah's analogy is flawed and that the country was more cohesive in purpose then and had revolutionary zeal.
"What is different today is that you don't have the level of unity you had during the Iran-Iraq war, and the revolution had just taken place," said Alireza Nader, an Iran specialist at the Washington office of the RAND Corporation, a research group.
"Right now a lot of Iranians lack faith in their government," he said. "This is their vulnerability."
The Gallup poll suggested that many Iranians were fearful over the sanctions. It found that nearly two-thirds of Iranians thought the sanctions would hurt their livelihoods. The poll also found that almost half of Iranians said there were times in the past year when they lacked enough money to buy food their families needed -- triple the level from 2005. The survey, based on telephone interviews with 1,000 adults from Dec. 16 to Jan. 10, had a sampling error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.
Mohammad Khazaee, Iran's ambassador to the United Nations, acknowledged that the sanctions were a problem. "The good news is that we have learned very much how to manage with sanctions," he told a group of editors from The New York Times on Tuesday. "But nobody can say that the sanctions are not hurting."

Full text: PEOPLE'S intuition is often wrong when it comes to investing. We often buy when we should be selling, or focus on red herrings. So are there ways to overcome these tendencies?
After a flood of research in the growing field of behavioral economics, we know the answer is yes, although doing the right thing with money involves recognition and discipline.
Many tenets of prudent financial decision-making can be found in the work of Daniel Kahneman and his acolytes. Professor Kahneman's best-selling book, "Thinking, Fast and Slow," (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 2011) opens up some new vistas on human behavior that can be applied to our worst investing mistakes.
Professor Kahneman, a psychologist who won the Nobel Prize in economic science in 2002, has turned classical economics on its head in many ways, noting that it is folly to engage in day trading or to think you have an advantage in picking securities. Investors don't always act in their own best interests and are consistently led astray by emotional motives and cognitive errors, he said. Overconfidence is a bugaboo.
"People have little idea, by and large, of the investment world," Professor Kahneman said. "They are convinced they have an advantage."
One of the most common errors investors commit, he has found, is making bad decisions simply because of the overriding fear of loss, an important concept of the so-called prospect theory he pioneered with his fellow researcher, Amos Tversky, who died in 1996.
Investors will also "anchor" to a target price for a security for arbitrary and irrational reasons, often holding the stock long after it should have been sold.
Instead of portraying investors as idealized rational beings who always act in their own best interests -- often the case in standard financial economics -- behavioral economics casts them as "normal" people who chase biases that have little connection to the statistical truth or the right thing to do.
Our brains, in Professor Kahneman's view and according to neurological research, rely more on a so-called System 1 that processes information rapidly and intuitively than a System 2 that is more analytical and deliberate.
One cognitive bias is called "faulty framing." Say you buy a stock at a certain price and it plummets. You are reluctant to sell it because of the emotional distress of taking a loss. Because it is a paper loss, you hold it in a protected mental account as something that still has hope, even though the market has decided otherwise.
Here are some other common errors researchers have identified:
MISREADING SHORT-TERM RESULTS Regarding what happens in the short term as predictive of a future outcome is a frequent mistake -- for example, when an investor views last year's strong performance as a sign that a manager's hot streak will continue. Most good runs are a matter of luck, Professor Kahneman said. "If a manager had three or four good years, you're asking for trouble," he said. "Go with real statistics, not small samples."
TRUSTING GUT INSTINCTS Intuitive insights have proved to be consistently unreliable as a basis for picking profitable investments. Professor Kahneman suggested "taking the outside view" and mistrusting your intuition.
REACTING TO OUTSIDE EVENTS No doubt the euro zone mess, debt problems in the United States and other world calamities are threats to global investing. But such problems often involve too much information to process. Investors need to make decisions one at time, in a manner that corresponds to their own goals. "There's very little relation to the importance of problems and the time we spend thinking about them," Professor Kahneman said.
Meir Statman, a finance professor at Santa Clara University in California and author of "What Investors Really Want" (McGraw-Hill, 2010), said, "We can overcome System 1 by employing critical thinking." Instead, he added, "Think like a scientist."
Professors Kahneman and Statman have found that amateur investors get into the most trouble when they start actively trading, a situation in which they have no real advantage. They are likely to lose money, several studies have shown.
"In every trade there is an idiot," Professor Statman said. "If you don't know who it is, it's you."
While Professor Statman does not begrudge investors the thrill of trading, he suggests limiting the activity. It may be all right to play the market, he said, "as long as it won't imperil your retirement."
Most behavioral economists are wary of active management, which applies to buying mutual funds and other vehicles where professional managers are trying to time market conditions. Even the best stock pickers failed to foresee the consequences of the 2008 financial crisis. That is an additional shortcoming most investors share -- the failure to anticipate and prevent damage from a worst-case situation. Market savants call this "tail risk."
"People are underinsured against extreme and unlikely possibilities," Professor Kahneman said, citing Nassim Nicholas Taleb's book "The Black Swan" (Random House, 2007), which examines highly improbable events.
Most behavioral finance experts counsel that for the majority of people, a passive investment approach is the wisest. Devise a portfolio that measures and limits the amount of risk you can afford to take, align it to your specific goals -- college financing, retirement, estate building -- and leave it alone. Professor Statman recommends low-cost index funds. "I just let them ride," he said.
Professor Kahneman suggests avoiding highly leveraged funds and keeping an eye on inflation. Having experienced high inflation while living in Israel more than 30 years ago, he has invested in Treasury inflation-protected securities, known as TIPS, which can be bought individually through the United States Treasury or packaged in mutual funds like the iShares Barclays TIPS exchange-traded fund.
"We need to be more systematic," Professor Kahneman said. "We need to slow ourselves down."
Reflection may be the biggest ally in avoiding investment folly. To be successful in sidestepping our System 1 tendencies, one of the best strategies is to shelve a hot investment idea for a week and think about it analytically -- or employ a trusted adviser to analyze the idea carefully.
In this regard, perhaps an old proverb offers some of the best advice. Haste can indeed make waste.

To Senators, Bernanke Defends the Fed's Dual Objectives

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, continued to defend the Fed's efforts to control inflation and unemployment during an appearance Tuesday before the Senate Budget Committee.
The Fed last month released a formal statement describing for the first time how it intended to pursue those objectives, as required by Congress, even though the dueling mandates of managing inflation and unemployment sometimes pull monetary policy in opposite directions. The core of this newly articulated doctrine, shaped by Mr. Bernanke, is that the Fed will not seek to encourage inflation, but if inflation should rise, it may rein it in more slowly to promote job growth.
Senate Republicans on Tuesday, like their colleagues in the House last week, expressed concern that the Fed effectively was declaring that it would prioritize job growth over inflation.
"Is the Fed sending a signal that keeping inflation in check is a secondary priority to achieving full employment?" asked Senator Charles Grassley, Republican of Iowa.
"I want to disabuse any notion that there is a priority for maximum employment," Mr. Bernanke responded.
Instead, he told another questioner, Senator Patrick Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, that the Fed's approach to its dual objectives is "fully balanced and symmetrical."
The hearing was remarkable for the absence of any direct questions for Mr. Bernanke about the most recent jobs data, released Friday, which showed that the economy added more jobs in January than in any month since last spring.
The Fed cited the weak state of the labor market last month in announcing that it intended to keep short-term interest rates near zero until late 2014. It also continues to stimulate the economy through other measures, including a vast portfolio of investments that it is shifting toward securities with longer terms to make borrowing even cheaper for businesses and consumers.
Investors want to know whether improving data would shake the Fed's commitment to these policies.
Republicans instead sought Mr. Bernanke's affirmation that unemployment remained far too prevalent and the recovery still faced challenges.
Mr. Bernanke agreed.
Democrats asked the Fed chairman to acknowledge that economic conditions were improving.
He agreed to this, too.
But both parties were stymied in their efforts to obtain his support in their battle over how the government should reduce its annual deficits. Republicans want to balance the federal budget primarily through spending cuts, while Democrats say the government must increase tax collections too.
Mr. Bernanke has repeatedly called on Congress to adopt a long-term plan for deficit reduction. He said Tuesday that this should be done "as soon as possible."
"We clearly need some major changes in our fiscal planning and our fiscal path going forward," he said, adding his familiar caution that the government should begin to put these changes in place only once the economy was stronger.
But he was blunt in refusing to specify such a plan.
"That's what people elected you to do," he said.

Full text: OVER the long term, the United States economy has been growing at its slowest rate since the Great Depression. Most other major developed countries have also experienced unusually slow growth over the last 10 years.
The American economy's reported 2.8 percent growth in the fourth quarter, at an annual rate, was seen as mildly encouraging. But it meant that over the previous 10 years, the economy had grown at a compound annual rate of just 1.7 percent. Until the current cycle, there had been no similar prolonged period of slow growth since the Depression.
The International Monetary Fund's latest forecasts indicate that there is not likely to be a pickup in growth anytime soon, either in the United States or other large industrialized countries.
As the accompanying charts indicate, if the fund's forecasts of 1.8 percent real growth in 2012 and 2.2 percent in 2013 prove to be accurate, the 10-year American rate at the end of 2013 will have fallen to 1.5 percent, lower than any figure shown on the chart. But it will still be a little above the 0.9 percent compound growth rate in the decade from 1929, the year the Depression began, to 1939.
The charts show 10-year growth rates in the six other countries that used to make up the Group of 7 industrialized nations that would hold regular international summit meetings. Comparable data is available for all the countries only back to 1981, so the charts begin with the decade that ended in 1991.
If the I.M.F. forecasts are accurate, France, Italy and Britain will end 2013 with 10-year growth rates below any shown on the charts. Canada will hit a new low in 2012 before rising a bit in 2013. Its forecast 10-year growth rate of 1.8 percent would have seemed very low a few years ago. But it is the best of any of the countries shown.
For Britain, which endured a horrible decade in the 1970s that led to talk of the "British disease," the previous postwar low, not shown in the charts, was in the 10 years ending in the second quarter of 1983, an annual rate of 0.95 percent. The figure for the 10 years through 2011 is 1.4 percent, but the I.M.F. predictions indicate the 2013 figure will fall to just 0.94 percent. The fund expects the British economy to grow by just 0.6 percent this year and by 2 percent in 2013.
The situation is even worse in Italy, where the fund expects the economy to contract by 2.2 percent this year and 0.6 percent the following year. If that happens, Italy's economy will be smaller at the end of 2013 than it was 10 years earlier. The French economy is forecast to have grown at a 1 percent annual rate over the same 10-year period.
Germany, which has prospered in part because other euro zone economies have lost competitiveness, now has a 10-year growth rate higher than it was a couple of years ago. But at 1.1 percent, forecast to rise to 1.2 percent by the end of 2013, it is hardly showing robust growth.
All the figures cited above are for so-called real growth, which includes adjustment for inflation. But the charts also show actual gross domestic product figures without the inflation adjustment. If nominal G.D.P. is rising rapidly, that can make it easier to repay long-term loans like mortgages even if most of the growth is due to inflation.
In Japan, where deflation has been persistent, there has been reported real growth only because of the adjustment. On a nominal basis, the Japanese economy is smaller than it was in 2001. In the other countries, nominal growth rates have been falling in recent years, a development that has made dealing with the housing crisis in the United States and Britain even more difficult.

Full text: As it was in 1980, could it be again in 2012?
The 1980 presidential election was fought by a Democratic incumbent weakened by a poor economy amid worries that the United States had lost its ability to compete in the world. Gold prices had risen to unprecedented levels as the election approached, and the Republican nominee hinted he might propose a return to a gold standard.
That Republican, Ronald Reagan, won the election and soon appointed a commission to study the role of gold in monetary systems. To gold bugs, it appeared to be the best chance in decades to move the country toward gold and away from what they like to call "fiat money," a currency anchored by nothing more than government dictates.
Last month, Newt Gingrich, seeking to widen his support in the days leading up to the South Carolina primary, promised that he would appoint a new gold commission. "Part of our approach ought to be to re-establish something Ronald Reagan did in 1981 and that is to have a commission on gold to look at the whole concept of how do we get back to hard money," he said in a speech.
"Hard money is a discipline," he added. "It is very important for us to understand in finance that the entire contraption that has been built up over the last thirty or forty years has so much paper in it, so much debt, so much leverage, that we probably have a fifteen- or twenty-year period of working our way out of it. And yet, the alternative is to get sicker and sicker and sicker."
That call may have helped him in South Carolina, where he scored a victory over Mitt Romney, but it did not do much for him in Florida, where he finished a distant second in this week's primary. His strategy now is to present himself as the only conservative with a chance, and thereby persuade supporters of Rick Santorum and Ron Paul to unite behind him. Support for a gold standard is a major part of Mr. Paul's platform.
Mr. Gingrich, it should be noted, did not promise to support a gold standard, only to appoint a commission. If he is serious about following Mr. Reagan's precedent, there may be little chance of a move to gold even if Mr. Gingrich does win the Republican nomination and the November election. In office, Mr. Reagan showed no inclination to buck the collected wisdom of most economists, whether Keynesian or monetarist.
The 1980 Republican platform denounced "the severing of the dollar's link with real commodities in the 1960s and 1970s," which it blamed for inflation. "One of the most urgent tasks in the period ahead will be the restoration of a dependable monetary standard," it added.
As Anna Schwartz, an economist who served as the gold commission's staff director, later wrote, that section could be seen as a "veiled reference to a prospective return to a gold standard."
Under a gold standard, the dollar would be valued at a certain number of grams of gold, and the government would be ready to buy or sell gold to anyone based on that value.
The commission's report was delayed and when finally released called for a continuance of the monetary status quo, albeit with the possible issuance of American gold coins to compete with the South African krugerrand. The platform plank turned out to have no real meaning, and gold bugs were outraged.
The commission, Murray N. Rothbard, a libertarian economist, later complained, was "overwhelmingly packed with lifelong opponents of gold who buried any call for a hard currency." Ms. Schwartz noted that Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan, who was the commission's chairman, and Murray Weidenbaum, a member who was Mr. Reagan's top economic adviser, "did not tip their hands until the final two meetings of the commission."
Mr. Gingrich did send a signal that his commission would be different. He said the co-chairmen would be Lewis Lehrman, the author of a recent book titled "The True Gold Standard," and James Grant, the editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer.
"The fundamental conclusions of a Lehrman-Grant commission to consider a gold standard may be foregone: We're for it," Mr. Grant wrote in the latest issue of his publication.
Mr. Lehrman, in fact, was one of the two dissenters to the Reagan commission report. The other dissenter was a Texas congressman named Ron Paul.
More than almost any other dispute in economics, gold often seems to be a matter of theology. To supporters, gold has been money for thousands of years, and a return to it is the only way to keep politicians from debasing currencies. To most current economists, gold is a commodity, subject to the normal fluctuations of supply and demand. To them, the supply of money should be controlled based on economic principles. With a gold standard, the amount of gold available to back money could grow only at the same rate that gold stocks increased, something that depends on mining successes, not on the needs of an economy.
The University of Chicago last month asked a panel of 40 economists, including former advisers to both Democratic and Republican presidents, if they agreed that "price-stability and employment outcomes would be better for the average American" if the dollar's value were tied to gold. Every one of them disagreed, some with more than a little incredulity that such a question was worthy of discussion.
"Why tie to gold?" asked Richard Thaler, a University of Chicago professor. "Why not 1982 Bordeaux?"
"Eesh," responded Austan Goolsbee, a Chicago colleague and former adviser to President Obama. "Has it come to this?"
Even economists with some sympathy to gold opposed the idea. "The gold standard adds credibility when a country lacks discipline," said Edward Lazear of Stanford, who served as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President George W. Bush. "The cost is monetary policy flexibility. The trade-off is unclear in the U.S."
Nowhere was the chasm in perception about gold clearer than at a Congressional hearing in July, when Mr. Paul asked Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, "Do you think gold is money?"
The Fed chairman appeared to be surprised by the question and paused for a few seconds before replying, "No."
Then why, asked Mr. Paul, did central banks hold gold reserves? Why not diamonds?
"Well," Mr. Bernanke replied, "it's tradition."
It is no coincidence that gold is back as an issue now, more than 30 years after its last significant appearance in presidential politics. It was the vanquishing of inflation by the Federal Reserve in the early 1980s under Paul A. Volcker that led to a collapse in the price of the precious metal and to the widespread belief in the wisdom of central bankers.
That reputation suffered badly in recent years. There is little doubt that the Fed, under Alan Greenspan, helped bring on the housing bubble through a combination of easy money and loose regulation of banks. But to most economists, the fact that central banks can err does not prove they should be replaced by an inflexible gold-based regime, which many think contributed to the Great Depression.
"A gold standard would have avoided the policy mistakes of the 2000s," conceded Daron Acemoglu of M.I.T. in his response to the Chicago survey. But, he added, "discretionary policy is useful during recessions."
At the Congressional hearing in July, Mr. Paul pointed out that the gold price had doubled over the previous three years. "When you wake up in the morning," he asked Mr. Bernanke, "do you care about the price of gold?"
"I pay attention to the price of gold," the Fed chairman replied, "but I think it reflects a lot of things. It reflects global uncertainties. I think the reason people hold gold is as a protection against what we call tail risk -- really, really bad outcomes -- and to the extent that the last few years have made people more worried about the potential of a major crisis, then they have gold as a protection."
Mr. Bernanke has a point. The price of gold in recent decades has been a reflection of the waxing and waning of fears of "really, really bad outcomes." When the Reagan gold commission issued its report in March 1982, the economy was in a severe recession but gold cost about half what it had gone for when the 1980 Republican platform was being written. The country was regaining its confidence.
In the current cycle, gold peaked at $1,900 an ounce last fall amid worries that the American economy was headed for a double-dip recession and that the euro zone would collapse. Those fears have since receded, although gold has climbed back over $1,700 since Mr. Gingrich called for a gold commission.
You don't have to be a conventional economist to hope that gold prices are going to decline over the next few years, just as they did after the 1980 peak.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Congressional Republicans criticized the Federal Reserve on Thursday for working to reduce unemployment and revive the housing market rather than maintaining a single-minded focus on inflation.
The Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, was sharply questioned by members of a House committee about the Fed's announcement last week that it planned to hold short-term interest rates near zero until late 2014, a measure that the Fed described as necessary to support a faster pace of economic recovery.
"I think this policy runs the great risk of fueling asset bubbles, destabilizing prices and eventually eroding the value of the dollar," said Representative Paul Ryan, the Wisconsin Republican who is chairman of the House Budget Committee.
"The prospect of all three," Mr. Ryan said, "is adding to uncertainty and holding our economy back."
Mr. Bernanke was calm and careful in his responses, but he did not back down. He told the committee that the economy, and the housing market in particular, would need help for years to come from the Fed and Congress.
Mr. Bernanke repeated the Fed's assessment, released last week, that the pace of growth would increase modestly this year, but that the economy still faced significant challenges, including the depressed state of the housing market and the risk that problems in Europe would infect the rest of the world.
In his testimony, Mr. Bernanke urged Congress in particular to confront "the urgent issue of fiscal sustainability" by enacting a plan to reduce the federal debt.
Mr. Bernanke repeated his familiar caution that Congress should not cut spending or raise taxes too quickly, because doing so could undermine the economic recovery, but said that a credible plan to make such changes in the long term could spur growth by improving the confidence of businesses and consumers.
The hearing was the latest opportunity for Republicans to vent their frustration with the Fed chairman, also a Republican, who in their view is undermining the nation's long-term financial health in his efforts to spur a short-term recovery.
Congress has charged the Fed with two goals, maintaining price stability and maximizing employment; Republicans are concerned that the Fed's huge efforts to spur job growth will eventually result in unmanageable inflation.
These concerns were heightened last week by the Fed's publication for the first time of a formal interpretation of its Congressional mandate. The Fed said that it would seek 2 percent annual inflation and try to limit unemployment as much as possible, and that sometimes one goal would be a priority over the other.
"My interpretation is that the Fed is willing to accept higher levels of inflation than your preferred rate in order to chase your unemployment mandate," said Mr. Ryan. "Is that not what we should interpret out of this?"
Mr. Bernanke responded that the Fed would "not actively seek" to raise inflation but if inflation and unemployment both rose above its targets, it could choose to reduce inflation more slowly in order to reduce unemployment more quickly.
"We are not seeking higher inflation," Mr. Bernanke said. "We do not want higher inflation and we're not tolerating higher inflation."
But Mr. Ryan pressed on, noting this was not a denial.
"I don't know how else to interpret this -- that the result of this balanced approach is that higher-than-preferred inflation may be tolerated," he said.
Democrats on the committee rushed to defend Mr. Bernanke, arguing that the Fed should be focused on unemployment because 24 million Americans cannot find full-time work.
"To deprive you of the tools necessary to boost employment would be a big mistake," said Representative Chris Van Hollen, the committee's ranking Democrat. "Indeed, without those tools, the economy today would be in much worse shape."
Republicans also excoriated the Fed for its publication of a "white paper" last month describing issues that are weighing on the housing market and encouraging Congress and the administration to address those issues.
Representative Scott Garrett, a New Jersey Republican, said the Fed overstepped its bounds by giving unsolicited advice to Congress about fiscal policy.
"You have two mandates in the areas of employment and fiscal policy," Mr. Garrett said. "That's obviously a lot. We have a mandate in the area of fiscal policy and we would like to retain that."
Mr. Bernanke appeared taken aback.
"We are trying to provide useful background," he said. "I apologize if it was misinterpreted. Our goal was just to be helpful."
Under subsequent questioning from Democrats, who asked why the Fed was not taking an even stronger position on housing issues, Mr. Bernanke rallied further, saying that the Fed maintained its opinion that Congress should do more.
"I think it would repay your efforts," Mr. Bernanke said, "to remove some of the barriers to a recovery in housing."

Full text: KABUL, Afghanistan -- The anticipated withdrawal of most international forces is still two years away, but already Afghans who have depended on the decade-old foreign presence for their livelihoods are feeling tremors as the first troops leave and spending and aid money dries up. Many fear that the rumblings could be a harbinger of far worse things to come.
The withdrawal of tens of thousands of foreign troops and international aid workers -- and the billions of dollars in aid they have brought to the country -- has all the potential to undo the fragile progress Afghans have made under the international occupation and, some fear, even set off a new round of insecurity and civil unrest. So dependent is Afghanistan that in 2010, international assistance amounted to roughly 97 percent of the country's gross domestic product, according to a commonly cited World Bank estimate.
That foreign money, and the end of the Taliban government, lured back Afghan refugees and moneyed entrepreneurs alike, and it has lifted important parts of the economy to unnatural highs.
"The investors, they are still trying to sell their properties to collect their cash money and move their families back abroad," said Toryalai Babakarkhail, 45, a former brick kiln operator who now runs a small real estate business here.
Already real estate prices, salaries, store sales and factory orders are shrinking, leaving Afghans in nearly every quarter to wonder what will happen next -- to them, their society and their economy.
At the Milli Factory, 150 men and a few women hammered, glued and bent over dimly lighted sewing machines on a recent afternoon. They once turned out 1,500 pairs of boots a day, exclusively for the Afghan security forces -- light brown for the army, black for the police. But even those orders were paid for by the international coalition, and already they have stopped.
Farhad Safi, the company's chief executive, said Milli had received no new boot orders for eight months. As the international coalition withdraws and Afghanistan is forced to pay for more of its own equipment, the government is buying Chinese and Pakistani boots -- which are lower in quality but cost 15 percent less, Mr. Safi complained.
"These products we are producing are for our stocks," he said.
Such a turnaround could reverse the fortunes of Milli and all those who work at the factory, where employees can earn $240 a month, a good salary here.
It could do the same for many other parts of the Afghan economy that flourished as about $54 billion in aid and military spending poured into Afghanistan over the past 10 years.
That money generated thousands of jobs for Afghans. It also produced a new elite in cities like Kabul, who clogged the streets with cars and created wealthy neighborhoods, like Ahmad Shah Baba Maina, a few miles to the east of Milli Factory, where electricity towers sprouted and six-floor apartment blocks rose amid the muddy hovels.
From a prefabricated tin shack on the edge of the neighborhood, Mr. Babakarkhail, the real estate broker, trades property to company directors, government ministers, members of Parliament and others in a class that has benefited from the infusion of foreign cash.
Outside his shack, a salt cart trundled past, pulled by a horse, its driver calling out through a loudspeaker -- a reminder of how the neighborhood bridges the old Afghanistan and the new, and how easily the country could slide back.
Already, the housing bubble is deflating. A typical house normally costs $30,000 to $230,000 depending on size and location, but deals dried up and prices dropped by $10,000 to $50,000 last year as people worried about the pullout, though prices bounced back in December, Mr. Babakarkhail said.
The same tremors are being felt about 20 miles away on the icy hills north of Kabul, where Miraj Din, 48, who used to deliver food and firewood in a wheelbarrow, now manages Mumtaz's Car Salesroom, selling imported cars to the country's elite.
Last year, he sold about a dozen cars a month, but this year he is selling only one car a month as Afghans with enough money to buy these fancy vehicles delay their purchases or move their money abroad, he said.
Sixty cars, including a blood-red Mercedes-Benz and a gold 2006 Toyota with "Amarican" scrawled on its windscreen for $18,000 -- one of the cheapest in the lot -- gleamed in the sun.
"Now people think the 1980s and 1990s crisis will start again and people will fight," Mr. Miraj said.
Fueled by reconstruction and defense assistance, total output for the Afghan economy, adjusted for inflation, has roughly doubled over the past nine years. Because of population growth, the increase in real gross domestic product per capita was about 50 percent.
But by 2018, on some assumptions, 90 percent of all that outside aid could be gone, the World Bank predicts.
The optimists in Kabul hope that Afghanistan's decade-long progress will help it weather this decline -- that the Afghan security forces, paid and trained until now by the international coalition, will be strong enough to keep the country secure and the Taliban at bay despite signs that the insurgency has strengthened, and that capital investments in infrastructure, including electricity, bridges, roads, new schools and clinics, could be a catalyst for private-sector enterprise.
But this rural country of 30 million people, where life expectancy is only about 45 years and infant mortality is among the highest in the world, will have to adjust slowly from the boom in services and construction to something more durable and modest.
With currently little export growth and scant large-scale manufacturing, some officials hope that there will be a renaissance in agriculture and regional trade or even a substitution effect from construction to manufacturing.
"Contractors currently dependent on work offered by foreigners will hopefully be able to use the skills they have learned and turn them to more productive activities, including, perhaps, for building businesses that could manufacture goods for sales abroad," said Josephine Bassinette, the World Bank's acting country director for Afghanistan.
As aid is withdrawn, the World Bank forecasts that growth could fall to 5 or 6 percent for the next few years. But the slowdown could be more severe if security worsens, if Afghans cannot maintain their new infrastructure or if the government fails to garner royalties from contracts for the country's mineral wealth.
The government calculates that these mineral resources, including big copper, iron and other deposits in provinces like Logar to the east or Bamian in the heart of the country, will play a large role in Afghanistan's post-transition future. But any delay in extracting the minerals, or sharing the wealth among average Afghans, would serve only to underscore the gap left in the economy as international spending is withdrawn.
"It is a bubble economy, and people will lose jobs when it deflates," said Thomas Ruttig, co-director of the Afghanistan Analysts Network.
Standing on a stony forecourt beside a highway into Kabul, Ghulam Sarwar, 40, a stocky man with a thin mustache, fled the Taliban for Pakistan but returned to start a business renting out cranes and earth-moving equipment for $200 to $300 a day to the military bases and nongovernmental organizations in the capital.
His business depends directly on foreign spending, and he has few illusions about the future.
"The Afghans, they can't build anything for themselves or they would have built these things long ago," Mr. Sarwar said. "I have no expectation for the Afghans."
No one knows when, but a painful slowdown seems to be coming to Afghanistan.
One barometer of economic confidence might be Mohammad Atta's store on what Westerners call "Toilet Street" in downtown Kabul, where the windows show off faucets, basins and the Western-style toilets favored by foreigners.
In the construction boom of the past few years, Mr. Atta sold 50 Western-style porcelain toilets each day, he said, as modern hotels and guesthouses went up, but now he is selling 10 a day.
On a recent morning, two contractors entered his store to argue that they wanted a better water pump for the money they had paid, but Mr. Atta waved them away impatiently.
"Ten is not enough," he said. He complained that the international coalition of the United States and its allies was leaving before it had finished its job of securing peace and fixing Afghanistan.
He held up his glass of tea. "They make a glass whole, and then they drop it and let it fall apart," Mr. Atta said. "When they are here there is more demand, but when they leave it will change everything."

Abstract: Mr. Obama and many Democrats want to continue most of those cuts for individuals with incomes under $200,000 a year and couples with incomes under $250,000 a year. Because of the recession, total federal revenues declined in the 2008 and 2009 fiscal years and are just now returning to the level recorded in 2008.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Congressional Budget Office said Tuesday that the economy would remain sluggish, with high unemployment, and that the federal budget deficit would exceed $1 trillion in 2012 for the fourth consecutive year.
The deficit will be $1.1 trillion in the current fiscal year, about $200 billion less than in 2011, and will fall sharply in the next three years as a result of tax increases and spending cuts required by existing law, the agency said in its annual report on the budget and economic outlook.
However, it said, that same combination of higher taxes and caps on spending will crimp economic growth. As a result, it said, the unemployment rate, which was 8.5 percent in December, will climb to 8.9 percent in the last quarter of this year, which includes Election Day, and will rise to 9.2 percent in the final quarter of 2013.
"We have not had a period of such persistently high unemployment since the Depression," said Douglas W. Elmendorf, director of the Congressional Budget Office.
Mr. Elmendorf said the tax increases and spending cuts "would markedly slow the economic recovery" in 2012 and 2013, but could add to the strength of the economy in the long run.
Assuming no change in current law, the budget office said, the economy -- measured by the gross domestic product, adjusted for inflation -- will grow 2 percent this year and just 1.1 percent in 2013.
The report provided grist for both parties. Republicans said it showed that President Obama's policies were not working, as evidenced by the high deficit, the rapidly increasing debt and continued high unemployment.
However, Democrats said the report confirmed their argument that new revenue, as well as spending cuts, would be needed to solve the nation's fiscal problems, and that a stronger economy was the best way to reduce the deficit.
The budget office said the federal government would borrow 30 cents of every dollar it spends this year, assuming a continuation of current law. Spending, it said, will total $3.6 trillion and revenues will total $2.5 trillion.
Tax cuts enacted in 2001 and 2003 under President George W. Bush are scheduled to expire at the end of this year. If Congress allows that to happen and if other laws remain unchanged, the report said, the deficit will fall to $585 billion in 2013 and $345 billion in 2014.
In other words, the report suggests, doing nothing may be the most straightforward way for Congress to slash the deficit, a goal espoused by lawmakers in both parties. Under an alternative scenario, the deficit would still drop below $1 trillion and decline as a share of the economy for several years if Congress extended the Bush tax cuts and reversed other budget-balancing policies.
This year's expected deficit of $1.1 trillion would amount to 7 percent of the economy, which is nearly two percentage points below the share recorded last year "but still higher than any deficit between 1947 and 2008," the report said. "Over the next few years, projected deficits drop markedly, averaging 1.5 percent of G.D.P. over the 2013-2022 period."
Still, the budget office said, the government will need to continue borrowing to fill the gap between spending and revenues, and the total federal debt -- the accumulated total of such borrowing -- will rise to $21.6 trillion in 2022, from the current level of $15.2 trillion. And net interest payments on the debt would nearly triple, to $624 billion, the report said.
The budget office said it would cost $5.4 trillion if Congress continued the tax cuts enacted in 2001 and 2003 for another 10 years.
Mr. Obama and many Democrats want to continue most of those cuts for individuals with incomes under $200,000 a year and couples with incomes under $250,000 a year.
Because of the recession, total federal revenues declined in the 2008 and 2009 fiscal years and are just now returning to the level recorded in 2008. However, Mr. Elmendorf said, corporate tax payments are lower than expected and have not kept pace with the growth of corporate profits, so the average corporate tax rate has continued to decline.
Lawmakers of both parties say Congress must block impending cuts in Medicare payments to doctors, who face a 27 percent reduction in fees in March. Just to maintain Medicare payment rates at current levels, without an increase, would cost $372 billion over 10 years, compared with spending expected under current law, the budget office said.
The number of people receiving Social Security disability benefits has been increasing in recent years, and the budget office predicts that the disability trust fund will run out of money in 2016.
In addition, the budget office estimates that Medicare's hospital insurance trust fund will be exhausted in 2022, two years earlier than the Obama administration predicted last May.
Mr. Elmendorf cited health care as a major factor driving the growth of federal spending. The cost of health benefit programs will more than double in the coming decade, rising by an average of nearly 8 percent a year and reaching $1.8 trillion in 2022, he said.
In particular, Mr. Elmendorf said, federal spending on Medicaid, the insurance program for low-income people, "will shoot up rapidly in 2014, 2015 and 2016" as the new health care law expands eligibility.
"About 67 million people were enrolled in Medicaid at some point in 2011," the budget office said. "By 2022, about 95 million people will be enrolled."

Full text: WASHINGTON (AP) -- The income of Americans rose in December by the most in nine months, a hopeful sign for the economy.
But the increase did not result in more spending; instead, Americans saved their extra cash.
Income rose 0.5 percent from November to December, the Commerce Department said Monday, in its sharpest advance since March. Spending in December was unchanged, following scant gains of 0.1 percent in both October and November.
Economists noted that income rose last month largely because of strong hiring. In December, the economy added 200,000 jobs, meaning more income available to spend. On Friday, the government is expected to report another solid month of hiring in January.
Despite the added income last month, Americans increased their savings. The savings rate rose to 4 percent of after-tax incomes in December, up from 3.5 percent in November.
If consumers continue to save additional income rather than spend it, the economy could slow. That could in turn force employers to pull back on hiring. Consumer spending accounts for about 70 percent of economic activity.
For 2011, the savings rate dipped to 4.4 percent from 5.3 percent in 2010. The savings rate had fallen to 1.5 percent in 2005, reflecting a housing boom that allowed people to feel more prosperous, and spurred them to spend more and save less.
Nonetheless, many economists are still expecting continued job gains to create more spending across the economy.
"The pace of job growth in recent months, while still not satisfactory compared to most past cycles, at least seems sufficient to generate enough income growth to keep consumer spending moving ahead at a modest pace," said Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist at MFR Inc.
Adjusted for inflation, after-tax income rose 0.3 percent in December. For the year, inflation-adjusted income rose 0.9 percent. That was half the rise of 2010.
Inflation-adjusted consumer spending rose just 2.2 percent last year, slightly better than the increase of 2010. The flat consumer spending in December was in contrast to the slight gain in retail sales during the month.
One reason for the conflicting data is that the consumer spending report covers a wider range of goods and services not measured by the retail sales report, like utilities, airline tickets and hotel rooms.
Joel L. Naroff, president of Naroff Economic Advisors, also noted that the consumer spending report came out a few weeks after the retail sales report, so it had more complete data.
Nonetheless, Mr. Naroff said the large gain in income in December reflected the solid number of jobs created.
"More jobs created mean more income and more consumer spending," he said.
Unemployment fell to 8.5 percent last month -- the lowest level in nearly three years -- after a sixth straight month of solid hiring.

Full text: LONDON -- Iran's foreign minister offered on Monday to extend a three-day visit to his country by United Nations inspectors in what seemed to be a further attempt to lower the strident tone of a crisis with the West over Tehran's nuclear program after the imposition of new economic sanctions.
It was not clear whether the offer was part of what European officials have termed efforts by Iran to buy time while continuing uranium enrichment. Iran says the nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, while Western leaders say it is seeking the capacity to build nuclear weapons.
The conciliatory tone struck by Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi, reported by Iran's state-run news media, was offset by other Iranian news reports that suggested Iran might be girding for a military confrontation. Those reports said Iran had tested new battlefield equipment including laser-guided artillery shells and a remotely piloted drone capable of carrying an 11-pound payload.
Press TV, a state-financed satellite broadcaster, also quoted Mr. Salehi as saying Iranian scientists would install, "in the coming months," their first locally produced fuel plates enriched to 20 percent purity to refuel a research reactor in Tehran.
Iran says it needs fuel enriched to that level to produce medical isotopes for the treatment of 800,000 patients. But Western specialists say that because of the oddities of how uranium is enriched, those batches would be the easiest to convert for use in weapons.
According to Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, Mr. Salehi, while on a tour of Ethiopia, was asked to comment on a visit to Iran by inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations nuclear watchdog, that began over the weekend. He said he was "optimistic towards the visit and noted that the three-day stay of the inspectors could be extended upon their request," the news agency said.
In Vienna, where the atomic agency is based, officials declined immediate comment on the reported offer.
Iran's semiofficial Mehr news agency quoted Mr. Salehi as saying: "We've always tried to put transparency as a principle in our cooperation with I.A.E.A. During this visit, the delegation has questions and the necessary answers will be given."
Iran has also said frequently in recent weeks that it is prepared to resume talks with world powers, which were suspended over a year ago.
The timing of the inspectors' visit was seen as important as the United States and its European allies seek to increase pressure on Iran. President Obama, moreover, has repeated that Washington is not excluding any options to deal with the crisis -- a thinly veiled reference to the possibility of a military strike against the nuclear facilities by either the United States or Israel.
The atomic agency team is likely to visit an underground enrichment site near Qum, where Iran has said it has begun enrichment work, The Associated Press reported. The team includes two senior weapons experts, Jacques Baute of France and Neville Whiting of South Africa, The A.P. said, implying that Iran may be prepared to discuss accusations that it is seeking the ability to make nuclear warheads.
Mr. Salehi's tone seemed to contrast with the combative note struck by Iranian officials last week before the I.A.E.A. visit. On Thursday, Iran threatened to terminate oil exports to European nations even before a European embargo on Iranian oil was to take effect this summer.
Iran also has publicized any sign that the effort to block its oil sales could falter. Press TV quoted the finance minister of India, one of Iran's biggest oil customers, as saying on Sunday that India must continue buying Iranian oil because other suppliers cannot meet its energy needs. At the same time, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran has acknowledged that the regimen of punitive sanctions imposed on Iran, which he had long dismissed as insignificant, were hurting Iranians.
The sanctions have contributed to inflation, shortages, unemployment and a sharp drop in the value of Iran's currency, the rial. Further signs of the impact were seen Monday in a huge backup of Iran-bound ships that have not delivered their cargo because of financing delays. Reuters reported that about 400,000 tons of grain are languishing on at least 10 ships anchored outside Iranian ports.

Full text: The Occupy Wall Street encampment at Zuccotti Park is no more, but the focus it brought to income inequality is having an impact in Albany and beyond.
The Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, plans to introduce a bill on Monday to raise the state's minimum wage to $8.50 an hour, a 17 percent increase. The bill also calls for the minimum wage to be adjusted each year for inflation.
Mr. Silver's action follows similar steps by lawmakers across the country: Delaware recently passed a minimum wage increase, and raises are being considered in California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Missouri and New Jersey.
And Mr. Silver's proposal comes just days after President Obama, in his State of the Union address, described the growing gap between the rich and the poor as the "defining issue of our time."
The New York proposal, which Mr. Silver said would be his top legislative priority this year, will be subject to close scrutiny from Senate Republicans and business leaders, who say the measure could hurt job growth. But Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, a political independent with strong ties to the business community, has supported Mr. Silver's call for an increase in the minimum wage.
"It is impossible to live in this city on $15,000 a year," said Micah C. Lasher, Mr. Bloomberg's director of state legislative affairs.
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has said that he is generally in favor of a minimum wage increase, but that he will have to see the speaker's proposal before deciding whether to support it. Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, has enjoyed strong support from the business community, but has also been under pressure from the liberal wing of his party to demonstrate concern for the poor.
The state's current minimum wage of $7.25 an hour, which is lower than that of 18 states and the District of Columbia, took effect three years ago as the result of a federal law. The State Legislature last approved a minimum wage increase eight years ago.
The neighboring state with the highest minimum wage is Vermont, at $8.46. In Massachusetts it is $8, and in Connecticut it is $8.25.
For Mr. Silver, the minimum wage proposal is one element of a broader agenda, including a tax cut for families making less than $30,000 per year, that he said he hoped would begin to address inequality issues.
"When you work full time at the minimum wage, you are poor in New York," Mr. Silver said in an interview. "You're not making enough to get by. We want to have people able to support their families, plain and simple."
Mr. Silver, who is sponsoring the measure with Assemblyman Keith L. T. Wright, also a Manhattan Democrat, estimated that the increase would benefit one million New Yorkers -- those making less than the proposed amount, and others making slightly more, whose salaries would be adjusted to keep them above the minimum wage.
Supporters say that a minimum wage increase could help bring low-income families out of poverty, stimulate economic growth and spur job creation.
"The Occupy movement shone a light on inequality," said Dan Cantor, the executive director of the Working Families Party. "Raising the minimum wage is a modest but real step in balancing the scales."
But opponents say it could hurt low-income earners and small businesses, by raising the cost of doing business, which could lead to layoffs.
"The national minimum wage went up, and in the United States of America the economy's the worst it's been since the Great Depression," said Senator Tom Libous, a Binghamton Republican. Mr. Libous said he was skeptical of studies suggesting that increasing the minimum wage spurs economic growth.
"I think that's a lame theory that doesn't amount to much," he said.
Mr. Silver's proposal may not go far enough for advocates who have called for an even higher minimum wage. Had the national minimum wage kept pace with inflation over the past 40 years, it would be at $10.39 now, according to the National Employment Law Project.
Mr. Silver's proposal "is a good start, but really is not enough for New York's cost of living and New York's economy," said Paul Sonn, the legal co-director at the project.
The Fiscal Policy Institute, which has been supportive of minimum wage increases, argues that people who earn the minimum wage tend to spend all the additional money they receive, which pumps money into the economy. The extra spending will create jobs and benefit the mom-and-pop shops that opponents of an increase say will be most hurt by a higher minimum wage, said James A. Parrott, the chief economist at the institute.
"They're going to be spending more money in local communities, where they live," Mr. Parrott said.
But, citing a 2008 study by professors at American University and Cornell, Russell Sykes, a senior fellow at the Empire Center for New York State Policy, said that increasing the minimum wage even to $8.25 could result in a loss of tens of thousands of jobs.
"When you begin to take people who are lower-skilled and require the business to pay them more, they make decisions of a different nature that can lead to job loss," Mr. Sykes said. "It prices less-skilled workers out of the market."

Full text: CORRECTION APPENDED
Santiago, Chile
LATE last month the British newspaper The Guardian asked readers to vote for its person of the year. The candidates included household names like German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the Egyptian techno-revolutionary Wael Ghonim and the Burmese pro-democracy leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. All placed far behind a striking, nose-ringed student from Chile named Camila Vallejo.
Though far from a familiar face in the United States, the 23-year-old Ms. Vallejo has gained rock-star status among the global activist class. Since June she has led regular street marches of up to 200,000 people through Santiago's broad avenues -- the largest demonstrations since the waning days of the Pinochet regime in the late 1980s. Under her leadership, the mobilization, known as the Chilean Winter, has gained nationwide support; one of its slogans, "We are the 90 percent," referred to its approval rating in late September.
Ms. Vallejo's charismatic leadership has led commentators to make the obligatory comparisons to other Latin American leftist icons like Subcomandante Marcos and Che Guevara. Yet "Commander Camila," as her followers call her, has become a personality in her own regard. She skewers senators in prime-time TV debates and stays on message with daytime talk-show hosts hungry for lurid details about her personal life, while her eloquence gives her a preternatural ability to connect with an audience far beyond her left-wing base.
In perhaps the most poignant set piece in the year of the protester, Ms. Vallejo addressed a dense ring of photographers and reporters in August while kneeling within a peace sign made of spent tear-gas shells, where she calmly mused about how many educational improvements could have been bought with the $100,000 worth of munitions at her feet.
Ms. Vallejo, like many of her fellow student leaders, is an avowed communist. But while she has publicly commended other regional leftists like Presidents Evo Morales of Bolivia and Rafael Correa of Ecuador, she and her generation have little in common with the older left of Fidel Castro or Hugo Chavez. They are less ideological purists than change-seeking pragmatists, even if that means working within the existing political order.
Still, there's no question that the movement is upending Chilean society. True, it is centered on a policy question, namely reforming an educational system that disproportionally favors the children of wealthy families. But the earth-shaking Paris protests in 1968 also began with calls for university reform -- before spiraling into street battles between radicalized students and truncheon-wielding gendarmes, opposing symbols in the culture war between old and new France.
The same process is under way in Chile. As the protests increasingly devolve into rock and tear-gas exchanges between students and the police, it's becoming clear that more than education policy is at stake: a nonviolent social revolution in which disaffected, politically savvy youth are trying to overthrow the mores of an older generation, one they feel is still tainted by the legacy of Pinochet. It is not just about policy reform, but also about changing the underlying timbers of Chilean society.
It's no surprise that the movement should be led by someone as charismatic as Ms. Vallejo. Paris 1968 had its celebrity protesters, handsome faces that brought hundreds of thousands into the streets, photogenic young men like Jacques Sauvageot and Daniel Cohn-Bendit. Chile has Ms. Vallejo.
Chile is perhaps Latin America's greatest success story. After decades of authoritarian rule, it has spent the last 20 years building a thriving economy with a renewed democratic culture and a booming, educated middle class. But it is also confronting a dangerous imbalance: While the liberalization of higher education has led to improvements in access, tuition has consistently outpaced inflation and now represents 40 percent of the average household's income.
At the same time, protesters say that wealthy students from private and expensive, co-pay charter schools have unfair access to elite universities, while the rest struggle to meet entrance standards at under-financed public institutions.
Criticism of the university system has been growing for years, but it was only in April that, energized by protests against a dam in Patagonia, students finally took to the streets. The protests grew over the winter; by the first press conference held by the national confederation of student unions, known as the Confech, Ms. Vallejo had emerged as its leader.
Echoing 1960s street activism, the Chilean Winter dabbled in the absurd, but with a high-tech, social-media twist. Thousands gathered in front of the presidential palace in June dressed as zombies, then broke into a choreographed dance to Michael Jackson's "Thriller." In July, students again gathered in front of the palace for a huge "kiss-in."
Though the ideas came, said Giorgio Jackson, former student president of Chile's Catholic University, from "everywhere, absolutely every local space," the movement's success hinged on the leadership's ability to channel such creativity while maintaining a unified front to government and the media. The organization used a Web site to gather ideas and disseminate content for placards and posters. And it has used Ms. Vallejo's 300,000-plus Twitter followers to quickly initiate huge "cacerolazos," a form of dictatorship-era protest where people walk the streets banging on pots and pans.
While they vow to continue until all their lofty demands are met, the students have already scored some political victories. The government's proposed 2012 budget has a $350 million increase for higher education, with promises to finance scholarships for qualifying students from families up to the 60th percentile in household income. Meanwhile, the year began with the naming of Chile's third education minister in six months.
It was only a matter of time, perhaps, before the movement's focus on education began to broaden. As more support for the movement came from outside the universities, its interests changed accordingly. "This year we have already started talking about political reforms and tax reforms, and we think the students and youth in general play an important role in profound reforms in the country," said Noam Titelman, the new student president at Catholic University.
Tax reform is, not coincidentally, now at the top of the government's agenda. And rightly so: though it has one of the wealthiest economies in Latin America, Chile is the 13th most unequal country in the world.
"Something very powerful that has come out of the heart of this movement is that people are really questioning the economic policies of the country," Ms. Vallejo said. "People are not tolerating the way a small number of economic groups benefit from the system. Having a market economy is really different from having a market society. What we are asking for, via education reform, is that the state take on a different role."
The movement has also begun to spread regionally. Ms. Vallejo lent her star power to Brazilian student protests in August, while in November students demonstrated in France, Germany and several other countries in support of Confech's Latin American March for Education.
"The student movement here is permanently connected to other student movements, principally in Latin America, but also in the world," Ms. Vallejo said. "We believe this reveals something fundamental: that there is a global demand for the recovery and defense of the right to education."
But the students clearly have a lot to learn about real-world politics. Ms. Vallejo and other student leaders spent weeks lobbying in Parliament, only to be left out of the final budget negotiations.
Frustration with Ms. Vallejo's strategy propelled a rival leftist, Gabriel Boric, to challenge her in the latest round of student-government elections. On Dec. 7, national TV news crews lingered past 5 a.m. outside the University of Chile to cover a stunning defeat for the world's most famous student leader.
Yet even in her early-morning concession speech, Ms. Vallejo claimed victory, recognizing that the movement was greater than any one figure. Indeed, her rise has barely broken stride. She just left for a speaking tour in Europe, while her first book, a collection of her speeches and essays from the last year, is rising through the best-seller ranks. And she is being heavily courted by the Communist Party to run at the top of its list for the Chilean Congress in the 2013 elections.
For all its recent stumbles, the movement's prospects of getting a woman under 26 elected to Congress would help fulfill one of its underlying aims, to kindle young people's interest in traditional politics. This may be Ms. Vallejo's greatest contribution: to restore faith in a discredited system by showing a new generation that politics can be responsive to the people's demands.
Correction: February 5, 2012, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this article attributed an erroneous distinction to the Chilean economy. Though it is one of the wealthiest in Latin America, it is not nearly the largest; Brazil's is.

Economy Grew At Quicker Pace In 4th Quarter

Abstract: Allowing these benefits to lapse would shave a percentage point off gross domestic product growth this year, said Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, echoed that sentiment, saying that the critical risks to the American economy were a worsening of Europe's chronic sovereign debt crisis or a rise in tensions between Iran and the international community, which could stoke global oil prices.

Full text: The American economy picked up a little steam last quarter, growing at its fastest pace in a year and a half. Whether it can sustain that momentum is critical to millions of Americans out of work -- and perhaps President Obama's re-election chances.
The nation's economic output grew at an annualized rate of 2.8 percent in the fourth quarter, the Commerce Department reported Friday, probably putting to rest last summer's fears that a second recession was imminent. Other reports this week on manufacturing and consumer sentiment offered similar, if mild, encouragement.
"All in all, it's not bad, but there's no oomph," said Jay Feldman, an economist at Credit Suisse.
Forecasts have called for such slow growth that the Federal Reserve on Wednesday said it planned to keep interest rates near zero through 2014. Even with the pickup in output, the pace last quarter was below the average of economic expansions in the United States since World War II. Given how much ground was lost during the Great Recession, the United States economy needs above-average growth right now.
Government spending is not helping, either. Not because it's too big -- but because it's shrinking at a rapid pace.
Spending at the federal, state and local levels fell at an annual rate of 4.6 percent last quarter, providing a significant drag on total gross domestic product. At least at the state and local levels, the cuts are likely to continue as municipal governments shed workers and public services.
At the federal level, the biggest cuts were in national defense, which fell at a whopping annual rate of 12.5 percent. That's an unusually large dip, and economists do not expect to see it repeated in the beginning of 2012.
But legislators may wield the ax elsewhere in the federal budget.
Congress has not decided whether to renew a temporary payroll tax cut and extended unemployment benefits past February, when both are scheduled to expire. Allowing these benefits to lapse would shave a percentage point off gross domestic product growth this year, said Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics.
"A great deal is at stake," said Alan B. Krueger, chairman of President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers. "Continuing that support for household consumption is extremely important for sustaining and strengthening the recovery."
Growth in the fourth quarter was also driven mostly by companies rebuilding their stockroom inventories, not by consumers who were shopping more or foreign businesses buying more American-made products. And companies are likely to have only so much appetite for refilling their back-room shelves if consumers are still unwilling to buy those products.
Consumer spending rose at an annual pace of 2 percent, slightly better than the 1.7 percent in the previous quarter, Friday's report showed. But based on early data, it looks as if consumer spending deteriorated toward the end of the year. This may be because of unseasonably warm December weather, which probably lowered families' household electricity and gas bills. Consumers also benefited from lower gasoline prices, but appear to remain concerned about stagnant incomes.
"We did have some relief on gasoline prices in the fourth quarter, but that didn't cause people to go out and spend more vigorously," said Nigel Gault, chief United States economist at IHS Global Insight. "It just means they didn't have to dip into savings."
One of the more positive surprises in the report was in housing. Investments in sectors like home construction and repairs rose 10.9 percent last quarter. The housing sector is so small now, though, that it didn't provide much energy.
Some economists found signs for optimism in other recent economic reports. New orders for manufactured durable goods, reported on Thursday, exceeded economists' expectations in December by growing 3 percent.
Credit to small businesses has also been expanding steadily over the last year.
"I talk to banks and I talk to small businesses, and I promise you, credit's been the main problem, just as it is after every financial crisis," Mr. Shepherdson said. "Once you see credit start to grow again, provided there are no other encumbrances" -- like last year's Arab Spring, Japanese earthquake or debt ceiling debacle -- "we should see small businesses expanding and hiring."
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, echoed that sentiment, saying that the critical risks to the American economy were a worsening of Europe's chronic sovereign debt crisis or a rise in tensions between Iran and the international community, which could stoke global oil prices. He said he expected the United States to grow about 2 to 3 percent this year, ahead of the 1.7 percent growth in 2011. Last year was the slowest growth in a nonrecessionary year since 1947, economists at Credit Suisse said.
Many of the bigger American companies have reported strong profits in recent months, too.
Companies like General Electric and Lockheed Martin closed the year with record order backlogs, a sign that, at least for some businesses, demand is so strong that they cannot produce quickly enough. The backlogs portend solid growth in coming quarters, and suggest to some economists that the United States could weather the European debt crisis relatively unscathed after all.
On the other hand, corporate success has not translated into big benefits for American workers and consumers so far in this recovery. Today, the nation produces more than it did when the recession began in 2007, but it manages to do so with six million fewer jobs.
Companies seem reluctant to use their mounting profits to invest in new workers.
"Businesses have been holding much higher levels of cash than they have in past," said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economist at RDQ Economics.

Abstract: Last year, REITs had yields of 4.5 percent, according to the FTSE Nareit index, and master limited partnerships had 5.6 percent yields, according to the Alerian MLP index. Another downturn and collapse in the rental market could hurt REITs, and master limited partnerships can be volatile; they fell as much as the equity markets in 2008.

Full text: PLAYING safe with your investments doesn't pay these days.
United States Treasury bonds and other high-grade bonds used to be the safe way for older investors to generate income in their portfolios. But yields on these bonds are now so low, they are not generating much income.
The Federal Reserve's announcement on Wednesday that short-term interest rates would remain close to zero through 2014 confirmed that there was little hope in the near term for much change in bond income.
But it is not easy to find something to replace that income. Other options are not nearly as safe. The wild gyrations in the stock market at the end of last year further unsettled investors who did not need much to remind them of their losses from 2008.
"We think the search for yield will continue for a few structural reasons," Barbara M. Reinhard, chief investment strategist at Credit Suisse's private bank, said.
The first, she said, is low interest rates. But the second reason is what keeps many retirees awake at night. "You have this aging population in the U.S. saying: 'I need to supplement my retirement through income generation. My life expectancy is long. I retired at 65, but I could live another 18, 20 years,' " Ms. Reinhard said.
So what can investors, particularly those nearing or in retirement, do to guarantee a big enough and regular stream of income? Here is a look at three variations.
LESS RISK It may seem obvious, but low risk means lower return. Tom McNulty in Scottsdale, Ariz., who worked in the automobile and mortgage businesses before retiring six years ago, found an adviser who practiced a variation on this theme.
Mr. McNulty said he depended on income from his portfolio for about 70 percent of the living expenses for him and his wife, Peggy. His adviser keeps four years of expenses in safe but low-yielding bonds, leaving the rest of the portfolio to grow.
"It wasn't just providing us the income but protecting the asset base we did have," Mr. McNulty said. "We hope to live another 20 or 30 years. We learned that 70-30 in stocks and bonds in the accumulation phase and reversing it in the distribution phase is just not going to work."
Jeremy A. Kisner, president of Sure-Vest Capital Management, which works with Mr. McNulty, said his firm wanted clients to feel as if they had a pension even if they did not. "What we've found is that retirees who have a pension sleep really well at night and they're happy," he said. "The clients who don't have that worry about running out of money, no matter how much money they have. We try to create a pension for them."
Mr. Kisner said his firm settled on putting aside four years of income for two reasons: If the growth part of the portfolio has a down year, money will not have to be moved into the safe assets, and the firm found that five years of safe money was too much, given the need to increase the rest of the portfolio through retirement.
"The strategy of 'I'm just going to live off this interest' was never the right strategy," Mr. Kisner said. "This low-interest environment has laid that bare."
MORE INCOME Henry Fleischer, a retired engineer who lives outside Detroit, has opted for a strategy that will provide more income now, require him to dip less into the principal of his retirement account and still have little exposure to equities.
His sizable nest egg is divided among investments in three income-producing assets: real estate investment trusts, master limited partnerships -- most commonly companies involved in the transportation of natural resources -- and annuities.
"We don't need to be superaggressive," said David B. White, his adviser, who runs David B. White Financial. "We don't want the volatility of the stock market."
Last year, REITs had yields of 4.5 percent, according to the FTSE Nareit index, and master limited partnerships had 5.6 percent yields, according to the Alerian MLP index. But neither is risk-free. Another downturn and collapse in the rental market could hurt REITs, and master limited partnerships can be volatile; they fell as much as the equity markets in 2008.
What is telling about these nervous times is that Mr. Fleischer should not have to worry. He is 89, and while he wants to make sure his wife has enough money if he dies first, he is less concerned about his two sons, who are successful and self-sufficient. Still, his portfolio lets him sleep well.
"When times are good, I kind of feel badly about it," because he feels he isn't participating in the rising market, Mr. Fleischer said. "When there are downturns, I'm very pleased. I make sure that greed doesn't overtake me."
A BALANCE Simon R. C. Wadsworth, 64, made his money in the real estate business. He retired in 2009 as the chief financial officer of MAA, a REIT focused on apartments.
While Mr. Wadsworth, who lives in Memphis, has much of his wealth still tied up in real estate, he says he thinks preferred REIT stocks, a niche among REITs, are a good source of income in retirement. On average, the preferred stocks yield about 7 percent, against 3 percent for regular REIT stocks.
But dividends are fixed for preferred REIT shares. So if inflation goes up, the payment stays the same. And REITs can buy back the preferred shares after five years, usually because they can sell new ones with lower yields.
Yet Mr. Wadsworth said preferred shares account for only about 7 percent of his income-generating portfolio. That is not because of the risks associated with them. Rather, he said, "you shouldn't put all your eggs in one basket."
His view could become the prevailing one in an era without pensions and guarantees of income. Just as assets need to be allocated when people are looking to accumulate wealth, they need to be spread out as people spend the money they made in their working lives.
Karen H. Wimbish, director of the retail retirement group at Wells Fargo Advisors, said people nearing or in retirement should think of their money as coming from three distinct sources: guaranteed income, stable income and what can be left to grow over time. Right now, all three sources might understandably leave people feeling unsettled.
She said there were fewer sources of guaranteed income -- pensions, Social Security and annuities are three -- and anything with stable income, like bonds, has low returns.
Still, she noted, interest rates cannot stay this low forever, so it will be important for retirees to be more flexible in the future. When the economy picks up, they will have to rethink how their retirement assets are allocated.
Keeping people patient until then could be tough, though. Joel Isaacson, founder of an investment firm of the same name, said investors too often look to buy something just because it has a high yield, without understanding the risks.
"One of the things in this type of market is, people get desperate," said Mr. Isaacson, whose firm handles $4 billion in investments. "This is where you see a lot of elder fraud, where people look for 'too good to be true.' "
He said there was no silver bullet to replace the high-yielding bonds of the past, unless you count Apple stock.
"If you look at the news today, the only thing you should really do is buy Apple stock," Mr. Isaacson said after the company reported record quarterly earnings this week. Alas, Apple doesn't pay a dividend.

Abstract: Nine years ago, Representative Howard P. McKeon, a California Republican, proposed to cap colleges' tuition increases at twice the rate of inflation, with sanctions including the loss of federal aid, but colleges protested, and the bill died in committee. At the American Council on Education, there are concerns that Mr. Obama's proposal to track outcomes by collecting information on graduates' debt and earnings would harm institutions that train Head Start teachers and other important but low-paid professionals, while rewarding business schools.

Full text: In a campus visit Friday morning, President Obama outlined his plans to keep college tuition costs in check, getting a wildly enthusiastic response at the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor.
Students cheered his oratory on the importance of a college degree, expanded student aid, affordable college costs -- and, of course, his many references to Michigan, a key swing state.
But out in the world, the reaction to the president's proposals -- tying colleges' eligibility for certain federal aid programs to their affordability and outcomes -- was far more tempered.
Most people stressed that they, too, wanted to make college education more affordable. But when it came to the particulars of the plan -- and paying for it -- there was no consensus.
"The idea of helping students and families pay for college is very popular," said Terry W. Hartle, vice president of the American Council on Education. "On the other hand, nobody would bet on Congress passing much of anything this year, given the poisonous political atmosphere we are living in. The problem is, many of the president's ideas are fairly pricey."
Briefing reporters on Friday afternoon, Department of Education officials said they would release information next month on how the plan could be financed, as part of the budget process.
Generally, in academia, there was strong support for the president's plan to double work-study jobs and to expand the pool of money available for Perkins loans.
And some leaders, like Bill Powers, president of the University of Texas, liked the administration's idea of tying aid to results.
"He's proposing a form of performance funding for a portion of federal spending, and my view is that, whatever level of funding we're talking about, that's the approach we ought to take," he said.
But others said they felt public higher education would suffer from tuition increases that were an inevitable result of state budget cuts. And while they appreciated the president's advocacy for affordable higher education, many were wary of his plan.
"The answer is not going to come from more federal controls on colleges or states, or by telling families to judge the value of an education by the amount young graduates earn in the first few years after they graduate," said David L. Warren, president of the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities.
He warned of unintended consequences: If colleges are forced to cut corners, educational quality could decline.
In Congress, reaction to the plan seemed to divide along party lines.
"The president is saying that people can't afford to go to college anymore, and that just simply is not true," said Representative Virginia Foxx, the North Carolina Republican who is chairwoman of the House Higher Education subcommittee. "Tuition is too high at most schools, but it isn't the job of the federal government to punish those schools. It's very arbitrary, and the president sounds like a dictator."
Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, a Republican and a former federal secretary of education, offered his own ideas of improving academic efficiency: "I've suggested that they could offer three-year degrees to some students. Colleges could also operate more in the summertime, which would make more efficient use of campuses and reduce their costs."
Many Democrats offered only the blandest of statements praising the president for tackling the affordability issue. "The president's higher education proposal rightly calls on colleges, universities and states to maintain a commitment to keep college costs low making it easier for American families and their children to afford a college education," Representative George Miller, Democrat of California, said in a statement.
Past efforts to rein in college costs have not fared well on Capitol Hill. Nine years ago, Representative Howard P. McKeon, a California Republican, proposed to cap colleges' tuition increases at twice the rate of inflation, with sanctions including the loss of federal aid, but colleges protested, and the bill died in committee.
At the American Council on Education, there are concerns that Mr. Obama's proposal to track outcomes by collecting information on graduates' debt and earnings would harm institutions that train Head Start teachers and other important but low-paid professionals, while rewarding business schools.
Molly Corbett Broad, the council's president, said many complex questions remained to be answered, among them, how affordability should be judged, and what the effect would be on public institutions that had had to raise tuition because of deep state funding cuts.
Furthermore, she said, even if the administration's Race to the Top grant competition may have worked in leveraging change in K-12 schools, higher education is so different that it is not clear that the president's proposal for a similar competition to spur state higher-education reform would be a good tool.
"The devil's in the details," she said. "And we don't know the details yet."

Full text: As the Pentagon Thursday announced changes in its programs, military contractors were bracing for cancellations or cutbacks of several programs.
In its latest round of budget tightening, the agency has said that it would stretch out purchases, cancel a high-flying spy drone and delay work on a new missile submarine.
The defense secretary, Leon E. Panetta, disclosed the cuts as part of a broader reorganization of the military meant to save $487 billion over a decade.
One of the biggest decisions will stretch out the purchase of 179 of the F-35 fighters that the Pentagon had planned to buy from Lockheed Martin over the next five years.
Mr. Panetta said the Pentagon remained committed to the plane, a stealth fighter that can attack ground targets. Different versions are being built for the Air Force, the Navy and the Marines. The services plan to spend up to $380 billion for 2,440 of the planes, making it by far the Pentagon's largest program.
The other cuts were spread out among the major military contractors, though some reductions would be offset by spending increases on computer security, other unmanned planes and equipment for the special forces.
The plan to cut the size of the ground forces by 92,000 and eliminate older ships and planes came in response to political pressure to lower the federal budget deficit. It will eliminate most of spending increases that were above inflation, thereby limiting the Pentagon's budget increases to approximately the rate of inflation after a big surge during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.
Pentagon officials said that they had tried to limit the reductions to weapons programs and would focus on continuing efforts to modernize the armed forces. Many of the most costly and contentious programs -- like the radar-evading F-22 fighter and a high-tech destroyer -- had already been canceled or trimmed over the last three years, leaving few big-ticket items.
Mr. Panetta said he had decided to slow the purchases of the F-35 fighters "to complete more testing and allow for developmental changes before buying significant quantities."
"We wanted to make sure before we go into full production that we are ready," he said.
The plane was originally described as an affordable and dependable design. But changes in the requirements, faulty parts and software difficulties caused several years of delay and turned the program into the Pentagon's biggest budget-buster.
Last year, Mr. Panetta's predecessor, Robert M. Gates, threatened to cancel the Marine version of the plane, which can take off and land almost vertically, if Lockheed could not solve some of the problems. Mr. Panetta recently lifted that probation, saying the company had made substantial progress.
Pentagon officials also announced that the Air Force was canceling one version of Northrop Grumman's Global Hawk surveillance drone. It flies at 60,000 feet and was intended to replace the piloted U-2 spy plane, which gained fame for flying over the Soviet Union during the cold war.
After an extensive review, the Air Force had decided last July to go ahead with the switch even though the Global Hawk's costs had soared and Pentagon testing officials had questioned whether it was reliable.
The Air Force had said then that the unmanned plane, which took photographs and was also supposed to intercept communications, would be cheaper to operate than the U-2. But Pentagon officials said Thursday that it now looked as if the costs would be higher over the next five years for the Global Hawk than the U-2.
They said they still planned to build other versions of the drone that could survey large areas, though those costs could rise if fewer total planes are built.
Mr. Panetta said the Navy would delay its long-range plans to build a new nuclear-powered missile submarine by two years to ease the current budget pressures and help start the program on a more solid footing.
Pentagon officials have said that the new missile submarines would eventually replace the aging Ohio-class subs, which carry nuclear missiles and could cost $5 billion each. Pentagon officials said they also would delay construction of one Virginia-class attack submarine, two coastal combat ships and a large amphibious ship to reduce short-term costs.
Most of the ship construction is done by General Dynamics and Huntington Ingalls Industries, which was spun off by Northrop Grumman last year. Lockheed and a unit of an Australian company build the coastal ships.
Still, the Pentagon said it also planned to redesign the Virginia-class subs, which are smaller than the Ohio-class subs and protect other warships, to carry more cruise missiles and upgrade radars on both airplanes and ships. It will also design a new long-range bomber to replace the B-2.
Military contractors have laid off workers and consolidated plants in recognition that the boom times were ending. But Mr. Panetta said some of the cuts would be offset by increased spending on special forces, other surveillance planes and protections against attacks by computer hackers.

Pentagon Says Cuts Would Affect Raises, Health Plan and Base Closings

Abstract: Pentagon officials did not specify what the limits would be on military pay increases in 2015 and beyond, when American troops are due to be home from Afghanistan, although they characterized the change as incremental -- an acknowledgment of the political risk of having active and retired members of the armed forces bear the brunt of the budget cuts.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Pentagon took the first major step toward shrinking its budget after a decade of war as it announced Thursday that it wanted to limit pay raises for troops, increase health insurance fees for military retirees and close bases in the United States.
Although the pay-raise limits were described as modest, and would not start until 2015, they are certain to ignite a political fight in Congress, which since the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, has almost always raised military salaries beyond what the Pentagon has recommended.
Increasing health insurance fees for retirees and closing bases are also fraught with political risk, particularly when Republican presidential candidates are charging that President Obama is debilitating the military.
Next year's Pentagon budget is to be $525 billion, down from $531 billion this fiscal year. Even though the Defense Department has been called on to find $259 billion in cuts in the next five years -- and $487 billion over the decade -- its base budget (not counting the costs of Afghanistan or other wars) will rise to $567 billion by 2017. But when adjusted for inflation, the increases are small enough that they will amount to a slight cut of 1.6 percent of the Pentagon's base budget over the next five years.
Nonetheless, Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta said he was working with about $500 billion less than he had anticipated having on hand through 2017, meaning that the Pentagon had to trim personnel and favorite high-profile weapons programs. "This has been tough work," Mr. Panetta said at an hourlong news conference.
He said that the Army would be reduced over five years to 490,000 troops, down from a peak of 570,000, and that the Marines would be cut to 182,000, down from 202,000. (Ground forces would still be slightly larger than they were before 9/11.) The Pentagon initially will buy fewer F-35 Joint Strike Fighter stealth jets, which are not expected to be in service until at least 2017 and have the distinction of being one of the costliest weapons programs in history. In the Navy, 14 warships will be either retired early or built more slowly.
Both Mr. Panetta and Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who also addressed the news conference, repeatedly said that the United States would still maintain the strongest military in the world, an assessment that seemed aimed at Republicans as well as America's adversaries. "Capability is more important than size," General Dempsey said. He added that "this budget does not lead to a military in decline" and that "it is a military that can win any conflict, anywhere."
Although all American combat troops have been out of Iraq since mid-December and the Obama administration is beginning to withdraw what had been more than 100,000 United States forces in Afghanistan, the Pentagon budget includes a request for $88.4 billion next year, above the $525 billion base budget, to pay for combat operations overseas. Mr. Panetta said that Afghanistan, where there are still 90,000 American troops, accounts for the bulk of that money. This year's budget for combat operations overseas is $115 billion.
Pentagon officials did not specify what the limits would be on military pay increases in 2015 and beyond, when American troops are due to be home from Afghanistan, although they characterized the change as incremental -- an acknowledgment of the political risk of having active and retired members of the armed forces bear the brunt of the budget cuts. "Let me be clear, nobody's pay will be cut," Mr. Panetta said.
Still, the defense secretary has also called military personnel costs "unsustainable." The Pentagon currently spends $181 billion a year, nearly a third of its base budget, on military personnel: $107 billion for salaries and allowances, $50 billion for health care and $24 billion for retirement pay.
Military salaries have risen steadily since the Sept. 11 attacks, and officers have in many cases fared better than enlisted personnel.
A private first class with a family and three years' experience deployed to a war zone took home $26,700 tax-free in 2001, compared with $36,000 today -- an 11 percent raise over inflation. A lieutenant colonel with a family and 20 years' experience deployed to the same war zone took home $84,000 tax-free in 2001, compared with $120,000 today -- a 16 percent increase.
Posing another political challenge was Mr. Panetta's announcement that the president would request another round of base closings and realignments -- never popular with members of Congress who try to preserve military spending, and jobs, in their districts. Pentagon officials said savings from any base closings were not reflected in the five-year budget Mr. Panetta was sending to the White House.
There were already objections on Thursday morning, hours before Mr. Panetta made his public presentation. Senator Carl Levin, the Michigan Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, told reporters that until the United States shut down some of its bases in Europe, "I'm not going to be able to support" closing bases in America.
Mr. Panetta has said that two armored Army brigades -- as many as 10,000 troops -- would come home from Europe over the next decade, leaving two brigades and some support troops behind.
Although Mr. Obama has given an aspirational pledge to reduce the nation's nuclear arsenal to zero, there was nothing in Thursday's announcement about reaching that goal. All three legs of the nuclear triad -- bombers, submarine-launched missiles and land-based missiles -- will be preserved. The program to replace the Ohio class nuclear-missile submarine will be delayed by two years.
Mr. Panetta has repeatedly said that he would preserve financing for Special Operations forces, cyberwarfare and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance systems, and the budget makes good on that promise.
The Pentagon did not say how much health insurance fees would increase -- the details are to come in early February. Families now pay $520 a year, far below the cost of a private carrier.
Criticism of the proposed budget came swiftly from senior Republicans on Capitol Hill.
"These cuts reflect President Obama's vision of an America that is weakened, not strengthened, by our men and women in uniform," said Howard P. McKeon of California, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. "To be clear, the impacts of these cuts are far deeper than Congress envisioned."

Full text: The world's biggest hedge fund is also one of the best performers.
Bridgewater Associates, which manages nearly $120 billion, posted returns of 23 percent in 2011 - a year when the average hedge fund portfolio lost 5 percent.
Against the backdrop of fear over European debt and stagnant global growth, the hedge fund, led by one of Wall Street's more enigmatic titans, Ray Dalio, sidestepped the mess. The fund did it with bets on United States Treasuries, German bonds and the Japanese yen, according to people familiar with the firm's investment strategy, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the information is private.
Such performance adds up. Over the last 20 years, Bridgewater had annualized returns of 14.7 percent, amounting to $50 billion of gains for investors. Over the same period, the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks returned about 8.7 percent a year.
A big chunk of Bridgewater's gains came in recent years, a volatile period that felled many funds. As the financial crisis wreaked havoc, Bridgewater notched positive, albeit modest, returns in 2008 and 2009. The next year, the firm had gains of 45 percent versus about 10 percent for the average hedge fund.
The firm has managed to post big numbers even as assets have swollen, defying conventional wisdom and industry experience. Investors poured money into Paulson & Company in recent years, after the founder, John A. Paulson, earned billions of dollars betting against subprime mortgages. Assets at Paulson topped $38 billion at the beginning of 2011, but many of his portfolios suffered last year, with one of the main funds losing 50 percent.
Bridgewater has been able to avoid that fate, in part, because it follows a go-anywhere strategy. The fund's managers assess the political, economic and regulatory environments around the world, and then make bets using commodities, currencies and other assets.
"It's become a more macro world," said Charles T. Cassidy of Cambridge Associates, a consulting firm that advises more than 900 investors with more than $3 trillion in overall assets.
This year, Bridgewater is bullish on gold as a hedge against inflation. The managers are said to believe that governments will need to print more money to help reduce mounting sovereign debt, which could hurt the dollar but help gold. Bridgewater is also betting against the Australian dollar and several emerging-market currencies.
The success comes as Bridgewater finds itself under the microscope for its peculiar culture and odd rules. Mr. Dalio, a graduate of Harvard Business School, is a fervent disciple of radical transparency, a set of beliefs that preaches the pursuit of truth at all costs. For instance, midlevel employees can criticize top management if they think a certain market position is foolish.
In an embodiment of his principles, Mr. Dalio wrote a roughly 120-page treatise, called "Principles," that is part diary, part philosophical musing and part self-help guide. New employees are required to read it, and it is available to the public online. Mr. Dalio, the son of a homemaker and a jazz musician, writes of his poor grades in high school and a subpar ability to remember names or grasp foreign languages.
Bridgewater's office in Westport, Conn., has a Big Brother vibe, employees say. Overhead videocameras tape employees throughout the day. To root out problematic behavior, employees are subjected to withering critiques from co-workers. These sessions are recorded and, in the interest of transparency, anyone can pull a copy of the video from the hedge fund's library.
Former employees say that while it can be an intense and unpleasant place to work, the intellectual environment is invigorating. Ideas are tested vigorously for their soundness. And employees are constantly pushed to improve their investment skills, even if that can be painful at times.
In the wake of some negative publicity that portrayed the firm as strange and inflexible, Bridgewater has begun an unofficial image campaign. Last year, Mr. Dalio appeared on CNBC, where he called the reports "a misunderstanding" and said they had "affected employment."
Bridgewater also began conducting focus groups at Ivy League schools with students bound for Wall Street. Participants in the 90-minute sessions received $100 gift certificates for voicing their opinions on the firm. In true Bridgewater spirit, they were asked to be as honest as possible.
"Bridgewater has done an extremely good job with its culture, where they challenge each other openly to come up with the truth," said Dick Del Bello, a senior partner at Conifer Group, a brokerage firm and hedge fund administrator. "Their track record over 20 years is pretty compelling."

Full text: Facing a wave of panic selling by Iranians worried that international sanctions and inflation are destroying the value of the country's currency, the rial, Iran's president reversed himself on Wednesday and allowed bank interest rates to rise sharply in an effort to stop a slide that has depressed the rial to a relentless string of record lows.
The decision by the president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, was an unusual about-face for the Iranian hierarchy, which has maintained a public stance of stoicism on the sanctions, imposed in response to Iran's suspect nuclear energy program. On top of four rounds of penalties by the United Nations Security Council, the United States, Europe and other allies have begun curtailing purchases of Iranian oil and limiting other financial transactions, increasingly isolating Iran economically to try to halt its uranium enrichment.
Mr. Ahmadinejad in particular has said that the sanctions will fail and that Iran is shrugging them off. He had long opposed the advice of economic advisers to raise bank interest rates to counter the rial's declining value.
But he apparently changed his mind after panicked selling of rials for other currencies and gold by Iranian households and small investors, which increased sharply on Monday, when the European Union announced its intention to stop buying Iranian petroleum. The semiofficial Mehr News Agency said a flood of rials for sale had "thrown the markets into total disarray."
The unofficial foreign exchange rate in Tehran has fallen to about 23,000 rials to the dollar, compared with about 11,000 to 12,000 to the dollar in December -- a 50 percent drop over a month. The weakened rial means Iranians must pay far more for goods, especially imports.
Under the policy change, announced by Shamseddin Hosseini, the economics minister, Mr. Ahmadinejad "agreed to a decision by the Money and Credit Council to increase interest on interest-bearing accounts."
The rates will rise to 21 percent, up from 12.5 percent, to encourage people to put their rials in the bank instead of selling them. Still, it was unclear if the move would ease anxiety.
Private economists had said Iran would have to raise interest rates sharply -- to at least a level higher than the current official 20.6 percent inflation rate -- in order to ease the selling pressure on the rial. But the inflation rate is believed to be far higher than the official number.
The policy change also appeared to be an acknowledgment that the disruptions to Iran's economy because of the sanctions, and Mr. Ahmadinejad's apparent inability to manage them effectively, could turn into a domestic political issue in the March 2 parliamentary elections.
Concerns about the sanctions have also reverberated through the global oil market because Iran is a major exporter, and if those exports were halted without a sufficient increase by other producers to compensate, prices could increase drastically.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve, declaring that the economy would need help for years to come, said Wednesday it would extend by 18 months the period that it plans to hold down interest rates in an effort to spur growth.
The Fed said that it now planned to keep short-term interest rates near zero until late 2014, continuing the transformation of a policy that began as shock therapy in the winter of 2008 into a six-year campaign to increase spending by rewarding borrowers and punishing savers.
The economy expanded "moderately" in recent weeks, the Fed said in a statement released after a two-day meeting of its policy-making committee, but jobs were still scarce, the housing sector remained deeply depressed and Europe's flirtation with crisis could undermine the nascent domestic recovery.
The Fed forecast growth of up to 2.7 percent this year, up to 3.2 percent next year and up to 4 percent in 2014, but at the end of that period, the central bank projected that the recovery would still be incomplete. Workers would still be looking for jobs, and businesses would still be looking for customers.
"What did we learn today? Things are bad, and they're not improving at the rate that they want them to improve," said Kevin Logan, chief United States economist at HSBC. "That's what they concluded -- 'We've eased policy a lot, but we haven't eased it enough.' "
The economic impact of the low-interest rate extension, however, is likely to be modest. Many businesses and consumers can't qualify for loans, a problem the Fed's efforts do not address. Moreover, long-term rates already are at record low levels and, like pushing on a spring, the going gets harder as it nears the floor. Finally, the Fed already was widely expected by investors to hold rates near zero well into 2014, limiting the benefits of a formal announcement.
"I wouldn't overstate the Fed's ability to massively change expectations through its statements," the Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said at a press conference Wednesday after the announcement. "It's important for us to say what we think and it's important for us to provide the right amount of stimulus to help the economy recover from its currently underutilized condition."
The Fed's plans for interest rates were unveiled amid a barrage of statements the central bank released Wednesday as part of its campaign to improve its transparency. And while it pleased some investors in the markets, it left others befuddled. The Dow Jones industrial average, which had been down in the morning, began rising steadily after the Fed released its statement at about 12:30 p.m. Wednesday. The Dow finished the day up 81.21 points at 12,756.96.
First came the Fed's traditional statement, released after each meeting of its policy-making committee, which said that the central bank intended to hold short-term rates near zero "at least through late 2014."
Ninety minutes later, the Fed published for the first time the predictions of the committee's members on when they would raise interest rates. It showed that 11 of the 17 members expected the Fed to raise rates by the end of 2014. Taken together, the documents suggested that the Fed expected to keep rates near zero until late 2014, but probably not any longer than that.
Since the beginning of the financial crisis in 2007, the Fed has alternated bursts of activity with periods of rest, concluding several times that it had done enough only to find the economy still struggling to recover. The Fed announced last summer that the central bank intended to keep interest rates near zero through at least the middle of 2013, and that it would seek to reduce long-term interest rates through changes in the kinds of investment securities it holds. Since then, two meetings had passed without the introduction of any new programs.
The Fed's latest action came after a run of better-than-expected economic data, suggesting to some analysts that the pace of growth might begin to rise without any further help. The Fed also is under relentless assault from Republican presidential candidates who have said that its policies are doing little good and will eventually spur inflation.
And there is growing criticism that the Fed's policies are unfairly taking money from savers, including many seniors who planned their retirements around the interest rates that low-risk assets like bank deposits used to pay.
Mr. Bernanke said Wednesday that the Fed was aware of this, but it was acting again because it still did not believe that it has done enough. At the same time, he suggested that the Fed was not on the verge of more drastic measures, like further expanding its portfolio of mortgage-backed securities.
Such purchases remain under consideration, Mr. Bernanke said, but only "if we see that the recovery is faltering or if we see that inflation is not moving towards target."
As part of its transparency campaign, the Fed also published Wednesday a statement of its long-term goals, formalizing its longstanding commitment to maintain inflation at about 2 percent a year. The Fed also said that it was equally committed to minimizing unemployment, but that its exact goal would vary based on economic circumstances. It said the goal now was to reduce unemployment below 6 percent.
The new forecast showed that the Fed expects to hit its inflation target over the next three years, but to fall well short of its goals for unemployment. The Fed projected that unemployment would drop no lower than 8.2 percent this year, just slightly below the current rate of 8.5 percent, and no lower than 7.4 percent by the end of next year. By the end of 2014, the Fed still expects that at least 6.7 percent of people actively interested in working would not be able to find jobs.
In light of those projections, it was unclear why so many members of the policy-making committee expected to raise interest rates by the end of 2014.
Asked why the committee would seek to raise rates in such a situation, Mr. Bernanke said that he did not imagine it would.
"We're certainly willing to look for different ways to provide further support for the economy if in fact we have this unsatisfactory situation," he said.
As for the forecasts, he said, "there is no mechanical relationship between these projections" and the committee's decisions.
Some analysts cautioned that the Fed's statements and predictions were being given too much weight.
"Here's what all Fed promises are worth: nothing, if the data tell them to do something different," said Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics.
Furthermore, Mr. Bernanke's Fed is now making projections about decisions that could be made under the leadership of someone else. Mr. Bernanke's current term ends in early 2014.
"I wouldn't feel bound by anything the previous chairman had done," Mr. Shepherdson said. "And three years is a very, very long time."

Full text: KHARTOUM, Sudan -- Around 2 a.m. Wednesday, elders in the Somali village of Galkayo said they began hearing an unusual sound: the whir of helicopters.
It was the culmination of a daring and risky mission by about two dozen members of the Navy Seals to rescue two hostages -- an American aid worker and her Danish colleague -- held by Somali pirates since October. The commandos had dropped down in parachutes under a cloak of darkness while 8,000 miles away President Obama was preparing to deliver his State of the Union address on Tuesday night. The commandos hiked two miles from where they landed, grabbed the hostages and flew them to safety.
For the American military, the mission was characterized by the same ruthless efficiency -- and possibly good luck -- as the raid on Osama bin Laden in May, which was carried out by commandos from the same elite unit. Nine Somali gunmen were killed; not a single member of the Seals was hurt.
One pirate from the area who seemed to have especially detailed information about the Seal raid said it involved "an electrical net-trap, flattened into the land," which presumably was the parachute. "Then they started launching missiles," said the pirate, who spoke by telephone and asked not to be identified.
Pirates operate with total impunity in many parts of lawless Somalia, which has languished without a functioning government for more than 20 years. As naval efforts have intensified on the high seas, stymieing hijackings, Somali pirates seem to be increasingly snatching foreigners on land. Just last week, pirates grabbed another American hostage not far from where the Seal raid took place.
American officials said they were moved to strike in this case because they had received "actionable intelligence" that the health of Jessica Buchanan, the American aid worker, was rapidly deteriorating. The gunmen had just refused $1.5 million to let the two hostages go, Somali elders said, and ransom negotiations had ground to a halt.
Somali pirates have held hostages for months, often in punishing conditions with little food, water or shelter, and past ransoms have topped more than $10 million. One British couple sailing around the world on a little sailboat was kidnapped by pirates from this same patch of central Somalia and held in captivity for more than a year.
President Obama, who Pentagon officials said personally approved the rescue plan and raid, had called several high-level meetings on the case since the two aid workers were kidnapped by gunmen who Somali elders said were part of a well-established pirate gang. "As commander in chief, I could not be prouder of the troops who carried out this mission," Mr. Obama said in a statement on Wednesday. "The United States will not tolerate the abduction of our people."
On Oct. 25, Ms. Buchanan and Poul Hagen Thisted, the Danish aid worker, were kidnapped by two truckloads of gunmen as they headed to the airport in Galkayo, a central Somalia town on the edge of pirate territory. The two were working for the Danish Refugee Council, one of the few Western organizations still operating in that area. The aid workers had just finished a workshop on land mines right before they were kidnapped.
Ms. Buchanan, 32, has been working in Africa for about five years and "could hardly talk about Africa without tears in her eyes," said Don Meyer, the president of Valley Forge Christian College in Phoenixville, Pa., which Ms. Buchanan attended.
Somali officials immediately suspected that a local employee of the Danish aid group had tipped off the gunmen, and though American officials argued that the kidnappers were criminals with no direct links to any of the pirate bands that have attacked shipping lanes off Somalia, Somali elders said the men belonged to a well-known pirate gang drawn from local clans.
Somalia's Transitional Federal Government, the internationally recognized but relatively impotent authority based in the capital, Mogadishu, has little influence over the pirates.
Neither do the traditional, clan-based militias that still operate in these areas but cannot afford the weaponry or manpower now fielded by well-financed pirate gangs.
Somalia is also considered out of reach for conventional American military operations, though it has been the site of several Special Operations raids, usually to kill wanted terrorism suspects. American forces stage the raids from a constellation of bases ringing Somalia, in Ethiopia, Djibouti and Kenya.
On Nov. 23, Mr. Obama called a meeting with top White House national security aides to discuss what to do about the two hostages.
Two days before that, Mr. Obama's top counterterrorism adviser, John O. Brennan, met with the Danish justice minister.
Then last week, officials learned Ms. Buchanan's health was getting worse, providing an "added sense of urgency," said George Little, a Pentagon spokesman.
Top aides advised Mr. Obama that a clandestine operation might be required, and Mr. Obama began directing the planning for a raid, Pentagon officials said.
On Saturday, top national security officials held a videoconference to discuss the final options, followed by another videoconference on Monday evening. Ninety minutes later, Mr. Obama gave the go-ahead.
According to Pentagon officials, shots rang out within minutes of the Seal team's reaching the pirate encampment in Hiimo Gaabo, south of Galkayo. In the ensuing gun battle, the nine Somali gunmen were killed.
There were differing accounts as to whether the Americans captured any of the gunmen, with local officials saying several had been captured, and the pirate who spoke by telephone saying that "five were taken alive." But Pentagon officials were adamant that no prisoners had been taken.
Shortly after dawn, the nine bodies of the dead gunmen were taken to Hiimo Gaabo. But there was little sympathy for them there.
Several elders said that they were pleased with the rescue operation, and they blamed Somalia's pirate gangs for sullying Somalia's reputation and causing inflation by carelessly spending millions of dollars of ransom money.
"The pirates are not taking our advice or orders," one elder said Wednesday. "They are outlawed, and they are only making our image look bad."
Somali elders have been trying to mediate in hostage situations, and a team had just returned from trying to secure the release of another American, a freelance journalist, who was kidnapped last week in Galkayo.
He remains in captivity in Hobyo, a pirate den on the Somali coast, because the pirates holding him refuse to let him go without a hefty ransom.
At 6:43 p.m. on Tuesday, as Mr. Obama put the finishing touches on his State of the Union address, he was told that the two hostages had been rescued and were safely in American hands.
As he stepped into the House chamber to deliver his speech, he looked right at Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta standing in the crowd and said, "Leon, good job tonight, good job."
At 10:32 p.m., after the speech, Mr. Obama called John Buchanan, Jessica's father, and informed him that his daughter was safe.
Asked whether this rescue mission signaled a new more aggressive tact against Somali pirates, the National Security Council spokesman, Tommy Vietor, said each episode would still be reviewed on "case-by-case basis."
But Mr. Vietor added, "Certainly, this sends a pretty clear message that the kidnapping of U.S. citizens will not be tolerated."

Full text: How goes the state of the union? Well, the state of the economy remains terrible. Three years after President Obama's inauguration and two and a half years since the official end of the recession, unemployment remains painfully high.
But there are reasons to think that we're finally on the (slow) road to better times. And we wouldn't be on that road if Mr. Obama had given in to Republican demands that he slash spending, or the Federal Reserve had given in to Republican demands that it tighten money.
Why am I letting a bit of optimism break through the clouds? Recent economic data have been a bit better, but we've already had several false dawns on that front. More important, there's evidence that the two great problems at the root of our slump -- the housing bust and excessive private debt -- are finally easing.
On housing: as everyone now knows (but oh, the abuse heaped on anyone pointing it out while it was happening!), we had a monstrous housing bubble between 2000 and 2006. Home prices soared, and there was clearly a lot of overbuilding. When the bubble burst, construction -- which had been the economy's main driver during the alleged "Bush boom" -- plunged.
But the bubble began deflating almost six years ago; house prices are back to 2003 levels. And after a protracted slump in housing starts, America now looks seriously underprovided with houses, at least by historical standards.
So why aren't people going out and buying? Because the depressed state of the economy leaves many people who would normally be buying homes either unable to afford them or too worried about job prospects to take the risk.
But the economy is depressed, in large part, because of the housing bust, which immediately suggests the possibility of a virtuous circle: an improving economy leads to a surge in home purchases, which leads to more construction, which strengthens the economy further, and so on. And if you squint hard at recent data, it looks as if something like that may be starting: home sales are up, unemployment claims are down, and builders' confidence is rising.
Furthermore, the chances for a virtuous circle have been rising, because we've made significant progress on the debt front.
That's not what you hear in public debate, of course, where all the focus is on rising government debt. But anyone who has looked seriously at how we got into this slump knows that private debt, especially household debt, was the real culprit: it was the explosion of household debt during the Bush years that set the stage for the crisis. And the good news is that this private debt has declined in dollar terms, and declined substantially as a percentage of G.D.P., since the end of 2008.
There are, of course, still big risks -- above all, the risk that trouble in Europe could derail our own incipient recovery. And thereby hangs a tale -- a tale told by a recent report from the McKinsey Global Institute.
The report tracks progress on "deleveraging," the process of bringing down excessive debt levels. It documents substantial progress in the United States, which it contrasts with failure to make progress in Europe. And while the report doesn't say this explicitly, it's pretty clear why Europe is doing worse than we are: it's because European policy makers have been afraid of the wrong things.
In particular, the European Central Bank has been worrying about inflation -- even raising interest rates during 2011, only to reverse course later in the year -- rather than worrying about how to sustain economic recovery. And fiscal austerity, which is supposed to limit the increase in government debt, has depressed the economy, making it impossible to achieve urgently needed reductions in private debt. The end result is that for all their moralizing about the evils of borrowing, the Europeans aren't making any progress against excessive debt -- whereas we are.
Back to the U.S. situation: my guarded optimism should not be taken as a statement that all is well. We have already suffered enormous, unnecessary damage because of an inadequate response to the slump. We have failed to provide significant mortgage relief, which could have moved us much more quickly to lower debt. And even if my hoped-for virtuous circle is getting under way, it will be years before we get to anything resembling full employment.
But things could have been worse; they would have been worse if we had followed the policies demanded by Mr. Obama's opponents. For as I said at the beginning, Republicans have been demanding that the Fed stop trying to bring down interest rates and that federal spending be slashed immediately -- which amounts to demanding that we emulate Europe's failure.
And if this year's election brings the wrong ideology to power, America's nascent recovery might well be snuffed out.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve, which does not like to surprise financial markets, has worked unusually hard to prepare the public for the changes to its communications policies that it plans to introduce on Wednesday.
While the changes could make it easier for the Fed to move ahead with another round of asset purchases later this year, by helping to explain why the economy needs additional stimulus, officials have indicated that any such plans remain on the back burner, and may stay there so long as the economy continues to recover.
Indeed, the Fed is able to focus on communication in part because it is no longer devoting all of its energies to crisis management. These are improvements that the Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, has waited five years to make, reflecting his vision for how the Fed should operate in periods of calm, too.
The centerpiece of the new policies is a plan to publish the predictions of senior Fed officials about the level at which they intend to set short-term interest rates over the next three years -- including when they expect to end their three-year-old commitment to keep rates near zero. The Fed also will describe the expectations of those officials for the management of the central bank's vast investment portfolio.
The first forecast will be published after a two-day meeting, starting on Tuesday, of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets policy for the central bank. The committee also is considering the publication of a statement describing the Fed's goals for the pace of inflation and level of unemployment, which it has never formalized.
"Our moves toward greater openness in recent years have made our policies more effective and helped the public understand the Fed's actions better," John C. Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said in a recent speech.
Any bolder steps, he said, "will depend on how economic conditions develop."
This is not the first time the Fed has tried to get past crisis management. And after several false starts in which it overestimated the strength of the recovery, officials have been careful to insist that they still stand ready to do more if necessary.
The economy, after all, is merely muddling along. While economists calculate that fourth-quarter growth was relatively strong, most forecasters expect a much slower pace of growth in the new year. The Fed's own forecast, which will be updated Wednesday, anticipates growth of up to 2.9 percent. Most other guesses are lower.
Unemployment also remains a deep and prevalent affliction. Almost 24 million Americans could not find full-time work in December; the unemployment rate has ticked downward in part because many people have stopped looking for work.
Senior Fed officials have also sought to focus attention in recent months on the depressed condition of the housing market, arguing that other parts of the government can and should do more to help homeowners and revive sales. Some Fed officials have advocated that the Fed buy large quantities of mortgage-backed securities, which could further reduce interest rates on mortgage loans.
But several Fed officials have said in recent speeches that they are hesitant to support new efforts to improve growth, because they think monetary policy has exhausted most of its power, and because they are worried about inflation.
"Steady even if unspectacular growth accompanied by inflation in the neighborhood of 2 percent justifies some reluctance to change, in either direction, the F.O.M.C.'s accommodative policy," Dennis P. Lockhart, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, said in a speech this month.
Mr. Lockhart added a standard caveat for Fed officials, that the persistence of high unemployment required the Fed to keep thinking about doing more.
"Now is not a time to lock into a rigid position," he said.
But Fed officials have made clear that high unemployment is an insufficient cause for additional action, at least as long as inflation remains near 2 percent.
Sandra Pianalto, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, said in a recent speech that the economy would not create enough jobs to return unemployment to normal levels for "perhaps even four or five years."
"Sooner, of course, would be better for everyone," she said. "But I want to be on a path toward full employment that
doesn't create an inflation problem down the road."
The communications changes that the Fed plans to announce Wednesday mark the furthest advance in a 20-year-old campaign to increase the transparency of its decision-making as a means to increase the impact of its policies. As recently as the early 1990s, the Fed still did not regularly announce the decisions reached at its policy meetings. Now it plans to start publishing predictions about the outcomes of future meetings to guide investor expectations.
The Fed disclosed its plans this month when it released a description of the committee's most recent meeting, in December. On Friday it followed up by releasing the templates that will be used to publish the predictions.
The predictions themselves could have a mild effect on markets. The Fed said this summer that it would maintain short-term rates near zero through middle of 2013, at least. Mr. Bernanke has since underscored the words "at least," and analysts expect the forecast will show that most members of the committee intend to hold rates near zero into 2014.
Pushing back that timetable will tend to reduce interest rates, but the impact is likely to be minor, as asset prices already reflect an expectation that rates will not rise before 2014.
"In policy terms, this is a historic change," Paul Ashworth, chief North American economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note to clients. "In practical terms, however, the change isn't going to have any major impact."

Full text: Should workers be compelled to join unions or pay dues? Readers debate "right to work" laws now being considered.
The Letter
To the Editor:
For the first time in more than 60 years, politicians are arguing with great fervor about "right to work" laws -- state laws that bar unions and employers from requiring that workers join unions or pay union dues without joining.
Currently 22 states have right-to-work laws, and Indiana's Legislature is now considering passing one, the first in a decade.
Beyond the hyperbole of employer and union groups are the two fundamental questions underlying right-to-work laws.
Unions ask, "Should workers who are covered by collective bargaining agreements be permitted to be 'free riders' and receive union protections and benefits without paying for them?" And employers ask, "Should workers be compelled to join or pay dues to organizations against their wishes?" This is nothing less than a clash between the basic free-rider and freedom of association arguments.
Right-to-work laws are found in the states with the lowest union membership (such as Texas, Alabama and South Carolina), but it is not clear whether membership is low because there are right-to-work laws and unions are discouraged from organizing, or if there are right-to-work laws because membership is initially low and thus unions lack political clout in these states.
Unions argue that right-to-work laws mean less revenues in the form of members' dues. If it costs them about $1,500 to organize each new member, unions can't see any return on their organizing investment in right-to-work law states.
But employers claim that without right-to-work laws, unions would organize more members, and as wages increase, jobs would be lost.
It will not be surprising, as the Republican primaries move to South Carolina and Florida, to hear the candidates energetically promote more right-to-work laws and even a national right-to-work law.

Readers React
The fundamental question about "right to work" laws is whether or not we want to continue the downward plunge in the quality of life for middle-class Americans that has accompanied the de-unionization of the American work force.
Take a close look at who has been getting what since about the mid-1950s. That's roughly when the anti-worker laws adopted in the late 1940s -- and the tightly woven web of arcane anti-labor court and regulatory agency decisions that flow from those laws -- began to bite.
In the early 1950s more than a third of American workers in private industry belonged to unions. Today it's less than 7 percent and dropping. During that same period, real income for American workers adjusted for inflation has been declining, the number of workers without medical insurance and without pensions has been increasing, and the gap in income and wealth between the rich and everyone else in America has been exponentially increasing. In short, the American Dream has been evaporating.
Want to see the Dream disappear altogether? Pass more "right to work" laws. States with such laws tend to have lower household income, more workers without medical insurance and pensions, higher rates of workplace death and the lowest educational levels.
The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. got it exactly right: "We must guard against being fooled by false slogans, as 'right to work.' It provides no 'rights' and no 'works.' Its purpose is to destroy labor unions and the freedom of collective bargaining."

I was a dues-paying member of the Philadelphia Federation of Teachers for 38 years before retiring in 2007. I have seen firsthand how those teachers who chose not to become union members and pay dues benefited from the collective bargaining agreements that our union members had to make numerous sacrifices for, like going out on strike, being jailed and being beaten up on picket lines.
In our efforts to improve teachers' salaries, benefits and working conditions and students' educational opportunities, we lost months' worth of pay that would never be recouped, while nonunion members crossed our picket lines, collected their salaries and then enjoyed the fruits of our labor.
I believe that every person has the right not to join a labor union, whether in the private or public sector. What they don't have the right to do is reap the rewards of the gains made by union members through collective bargaining agreements without having had to pay any price of their own.
JACK STUTMAN
Orlando, Fla., Jan. 19, 2012

Mr. Chaison's letter represents a fair framing of the key points of the labor freedom (right to work) debate. Here in Michigan we are watching carefully the proceedings in Indiana while executing a broad educational strategy to get Michigan to become the next labor freedom state.
Labor freedom means that unions are as free to make their case as workers are to make their choice. This is not anti-union, nor is it intended to be. It is pro-freedom, pro-liberty, pro-civil rights, pro-family, pro-investment, pro-jobs, and, in the end, pro-union. When unions shed their government protections and we unshackle ourselves from what is essentially government-sponsored labor overregulation, they will succeed in re-engineering their business model so that the proof of delivering value will be robust voluntary membership.
Both sides of this debate can present data and arguments to support their case. The most compelling argument for labor freedom is the right to choose to belong to a union, or not.
Labor freedom states have had the greatest job growth, greatest population growth, greatest rate of increase in disposable income (factoring in localized cost of living) and the greatest increase in union membership! Compulsory union states have experienced the greatest loss of population.
It is time to have this debate -- open, honest and transparent.
MIKE SHIRKEY
Jackson, Mich., Jan. 18, 2012
The writer is a Republican state representative.

What is missing from this discussion is the concept of "exclusivity." That means that once a union wins a collective bargaining election, it is the "exclusive" representative of all members of that unit, and no other union or individual has the legal right to represent them in collective bargaining matters.
In many other countries, workers are represented by more than one union, which creates other problems for employers since one union is always trying to outdo the other and there is no single entity that can speak for the workers.
Under our system, every member of the collective bargaining unit, whether he or she voted for the union or not, has a legal right to be fairly represented by the union in the administration of the contract. If the union fails to properly represent any worker, whether a member of the union or not, that worker can file a charge against the union under a "duty of fair representation" standard.
It seems only fair, then, that all workers should have an obligation to pay a reasonable fee for that representation, even if they choose not to join the union for whatever reason.

Professor Chaison notes that the discussion over "right to work" laws centers on the questions of union objections to workers claiming the benefits of union representation without paying dues, along with the management claims of free association. But management also opposes one obvious solution -- to allow workers to organize "members only" unions that would only be required to represent voluntary dues-paying members.
The United Steelworkers took a bold but unsuccessful step in 2005 to do just this. It was supported by six other unions but opposed by the Bush administration, the Chamber of Commerce and other employer groups.
The union shop is based on the obligatory duty of fair representation of each worker in a bargaining unit. Every union steward knows this is a serious obligation, and nonmembers have successfully sued unions when they have not been given the equal (and sometimes very expensive) representation.
Employers' current position of opposing the union shop while also opposing unions organized on a members-only basis, without a requirement to represent nonmembers, is simply wrong.
KURT VORNDRAN
Washington, Jan. 18, 2012
The writer works for a labor union of public employees.

The right-to-work laws now on the books in 22 states simply prohibit the firing of employees for refusal to pay dues or fees to a union that they never personally asked for in the first place, or no longer want.
As the National Right to Work Committee has long pointed out, the principal reason for adopting right-to-work laws is that the individual employee should not be forced, as a condition of holding a job, to support financially an organization that he or she sincerely believes acts contrary to his or her interests.
Forced-unionism apologists implicitly argue that union officials never act contrary to the interests of any employee, and any employee who says otherwise is a hypocritical "free loader." This bespeaks a shockingly cynical and hostile assessment of employees in a country whose citizens voluntarily give away a higher share of their income to charities than citizens of any other country.
Forced-unionism apologists also ignore, or seek to explain away, data suggesting that the labor law regime they favor is economically harmful to workers. For example, from 2000 to 2010, aggregate real compensation (including wages, salaries, benefits and bonuses) for private-sector employees increased by over 11 percent in right-to-work states, but by less than 1 percent in the 28 forced-unionism states.

The Writer Responds
I find it disappointing but not unexpected that the comments about "right to work" laws are so extreme.
Some, like Mr. Joyce, say that right-to-work laws, by prohibiting compulsory union membership and dues-paying, only hurt union members and working families striving to enter the middle class. At the other extreme are those, like Mr. Shirkey, who want to protect workers' choice.
And it all seems so logical. For example, as a rationale for the case against right-to-work laws, Mr. Cole writes that if a union must represent all workers in a workplace equally and fairly, workers should at least pay for union representation, or find work elsewhere.
The arguments for and against right-to-work laws look to me like rehashed talking points -- brief, dramatic statements made to be faxed to media outlets. They leave crucial questions unanswered, or not even asked.
What exactly do right-to-work laws have to do with organizing, since they affect the status of workers after unions have successfully organized a workplace? Might right-to-work laws actually strengthen unions, since workers will have joined unions voluntarily and be more willing to participate in union affairs and run for office? And, finally, do workers join unions in right-to-work law states because they do not know that they are legally free not to join, or because they want to avoid the stigma of receiving union protection without paying for it, or because they believe in the values of unionism?
For the past 25 years, I have had student teams in my labor relations courses debate right-to-work laws. I am not surprised that a majority of the listening audience votes for "undecided" rather than "for" or "against." It is a complex issue with no easy answers.

Abstract: According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, as health care costs skyrocketed between 2000 and 2009, workers' total compensation increased by 1.3 percent per year, but workers' hourly wages alone increased by just 0.7 percent per year, significantly below the rate of inflation. According to an analysis I did a few years ago, for every 10 percent increase in the average cost of family health insurance premiums, the ranks of the uninsured (excluding seniors covered by Medicare) increased by 0.55 percent.

Full text: WHEN it comes to health care, most liberals are committed above all to ensuring that every American has insurance. In their view, the greatest achievement of the health care reform act passed under President Obama is to finally erase the moral stain of the United States' being the only major developed country without universal coverage. But we also hold the questionable distinction of having the world's most expensive health care system -- what about cost control? For many liberals, that just sounds like a cover for heartless conservatives who care only about cutting benefits and not about helping people in need.
But liberals are wrong to ignore costs. The more we spend on health care, the less we can spend on other things we value. If liberals care about middle-class salaries, public education and other state-funded services, then they need to care about controlling health care costs every bit as much as conservatives do.
Over the past 30 years, health care inflation has been a major reason average wages have remained stagnant. For employers, the cost of labor is total compensation -- wages plus benefits. As the cost of benefits rises, wages tend not to rise, or to rise much more slowly. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, as health care costs skyrocketed between 2000 and 2009, workers' total compensation increased by 1.3 percent per year, but workers' hourly wages alone increased by just 0.7 percent per year, significantly below the rate of inflation.
During those 30 years, the only sustained period when real hourly earnings increased was 1990 through 1998 -- which coincided almost exactly with a period of unusually low increases in health care costs.
The middle and working classes are also hit by the rising price of health care when states are forced to cut other services to pay for it. Last year, Medicaid spending was estimated to account for nearly a quarter of total state spending -- the largest portion of their budgets -- and it's getting only more expensive. States really have just three ways to make ends meet: restrict Medicaid eligibility (which most have done already), raise taxes or reduce funding for other programs to pay more for health care.
And so states have turned to cutting funding for public education -- the next biggest item in their budgets. In 2010, 29 states spent more on Medicaid than on primary and secondary education. By the middle of 2011, 18 states had cut funding for kindergarten through 12th-grade education, and 19 for higher education. It's no surprise that, in the last decade, the average in-state tuition at public four-year colleges rose 72 percent to over $8,000 per year, beyond what many students can afford. While health care costs do not account for all of this rise, they are a crucial factor.
But perhaps the simplest reason that costs should matter to liberals is this: as health care costs rise, so too do the number of uninsured Americans. According to an analysis I did a few years ago, for every 10 percent increase in the average cost of family health insurance premiums, the ranks of the uninsured (excluding seniors covered by Medicare) increased by 0.55 percent. When premiums doubled between 2000 and 2009, the percentage of Americans who were covered by employer-sponsored health insurance dropped to 61 percent from 69 percent.
This relationship between cost and coverage will change somewhat in 2014, when the provision of the health care reform act that provides coverage for the uninsured through Medicaid and subsidies kicks in. But even with subsidies, some Americans will find rising premiums unaffordable and will be forced to opt out and pay the penalty for not having insurance. Nor will the act do much to ease the strain on state budgets. An estimated 21.8 million more adults and children will be covered by Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program. While states will be responsible for only a small portion of these new enrollees, there will be added costs. And they will no longer be able to restrict eligibility to save money.
There is one final cause that is close to liberals' hearts and threatened by the projected rise in Medicare and Medicaid costs. The corresponding rise in the national debt will weaken America financially and diminish our voice on the global stage, allowing other countries less friendly to human rights and democracy to become more powerful.
There is an inevitable trade-off between rising health care costs and things liberals really care about, like access to college and good wages for working Americans. We cannot have it all. The health care reform act will help us save -- mainly by changing how physicians and hospitals are paid and delivering better care to our most expensive patients. But more can be done: for starters, we could speed up the implementation of payment reform, stop Medicare payments for tests and treatments that provide no benefit and endorse competitive bidding for medical goods and services.
During the campaign season and into 2013 -- a vital year for health care legislation -- liberals must make the issue of cost control their own.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text: In the year since President Hosni Mubarak was ousted, Egypt has faced many challenges: the military-led government's brutality against protesters and pro-democracy groups, its resistance to handing power to civilian leaders and the rise of Islamists in the country's first free elections. Now worsening economic conditions are further sabotaging hopes for a democratic future.
The country's foreign currency reserves have fallen from a peak of $36 billion to about $10 billion and could run out entirely by March. The currency is under severe pressure, and a steep drop in the exchange rate could bring painful inflation and more social unrest. Youth unemployment is about 25 percent, a dangerous situation where 60 percent of the citizens are 30 and under.
Egyptians want jobs, education and a say in governance. Many are justifiably angry about the military's autocratic control -- and will be angrier still if economic conditions deteriorate further. They aren't the only ones with a stake in the outcome. Egypt is the fourth-largest economy in the Middle East. Its success, or failure, will have a huge impact on the region and beyond.
Egypt's military rulers are now realizing how big a threat the collapsing economy is -- and they clearly don't want to be blamed. In May, they rejected a $3.2 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund, saying it would infringe on Egypt's sovereignty. They wanted the money, but with no strings attached -- no mandatory reforms or austerity measures, like cutting food and fuel subsidies. Now desperate, they resurrected the loan request this week and welcomed an I.M.F. delegation to discuss possible components of an economic program. The I.M.F. probably won't make a decision on that request until March.
The fund's officials say that they do not intend to impose conditions on the loan. But even without conditions, Egypt must make reforms if it wants to spur private business ventures, foreign investment and growth. Such measures can never be sustained without public support.
In a recent interview with Reuters news service, the leader of the Muslim Brotherhood's economic committee, Ashraf Badr el-Din, suggested that the Brotherhood and other main parties are moving toward consensus on managing the economy. If true, that's a good sign. The United States, the European Union and the gulf states last year promised billions of dollars in assistance to Egypt, but most of it has not materialized as they waited for signs of political stability. If the I.M.F. negotiations over the loan terms succeed, those countries should move quickly on their commitments, including offers to begin free-trade talks with Egypt.
Washington and its allies may not have much sway with the military rulers or the newly elected political leaders in the short term, but they have to build long-term relationships with all segments of civil society. Some say Egypt could be one of the world's top 10 economies in a generation. That's a goal worth working toward.

Abstract: The central bank, based in Frankfurt, used typically understated and technical language to describe its actions, but it appears to have done what its leadership said throughout 2011 that it would not do: namely, flood the financial markets with euros in a Hail Mary attempt to make sure that the region's sovereign debt crisis does not lead to a major financial shock.

Full text: BERLIN -- Throughout the month, countries caught in the eye of the European financial storm, including Italy, Spain and France, have repeatedly defied expectations, selling big batches of bonds to the public at interest rates significantly lower than investors demanded at the height of the euro crisis late last year.
The surprisingly successful auctions owe little to improving economic data around the region. On the contrary, many of the countries that use the euro as their currency appear to be confronting a renewed recession, and pessimism about their growth prospects remains abundant. Just last week, Standard & Poor's stripped France of its coveted AAA rating for the first time in recent history and downgraded eight others.
Instead, most of the credit seems to go to the European Central Bank, which in late December under its new president, Mario Draghi, quietly began providing emergency loans to European banks -- hundreds of billions of dollars of almost interest-free capital that the banks have used to come to the rescue of their national governments.
The central bank, based in Frankfurt, used typically understated and technical language to describe its actions, but it appears to have done what its leadership said throughout 2011 that it would not do: namely, flood the financial markets with euros in a Hail Mary attempt to make sure that the region's sovereign debt crisis does not lead to a major financial shock.
Though on a smaller scale and in a subtler manner, it has in many ways taken a page from the United States Federal Reserve's playbook for the 2008 financial crisis, which has been roundly criticized in Europe as a reckless bailout that risks setting off uncontrolled inflation. And, at least for now, the effort has worked. Spain's 10-year bonds carry interest rates that hover around 5.5 percent, compared with 7 percent and higher in November, and Italy's five-year bonds are approaching 5 percent, down from nearly 8 percent at their peak.
There have been moments before when European leaders declared the crisis contained, only to see it return with renewed fury. But the central bank's incentives, combined with a push from the private banks' home governments, seem to have convinced investors that this time may be different, and financial markets in Asia, Europe and the United States have responded with strong gains this year.
Fears of a bank collapse -- the so-called Lehman Brothers moment, when one financial institution's failure threatens the stability of the entire system -- have subsided. And Greece appears to be closer to a deal with its creditors to pare back its debt obligations rather than a disorderly default that could plunge the financial system back into chaos.
That encouraging situation seemed highly unlikely as recently as early December, when panic over the European debt crisis was reaching a peak, just before a European Union summit meeting in Brussels. While national leaders postured and pursued their parochial interests, Mr. Draghi, told reporters at the central bank's headquarters that he would conduct "two longer-term refinancing operations" (in plain English, emergency financing) for cash-starved banks for three years instead of one year.
The European economy was on the brink, and threatening to take the rest of the world with it, and Europe's new top central banker did not seem to get it. "Why is it so impossible for the E.C.B. to act like the other central banks, like the Federal Reserve system or the Bank of England?" a reporter asked him. "Why do you not act more directly to help European countries by buying up the debt on a massive scale?"
Mr. Draghi said he was bound by the European treaty, which "embodies the best tradition of the Deutsche Bundesbank," the German central bank, code for strict inflation-fighting and the furthest thing from a wholesale emergency bailout.
European stocks fell. Financial experts declared that Mr. Draghi had disappointed. The world demanded a bazooka, but he had shown up with a water pistol, or so it seemed.
Less than two weeks later, on Dec. 21, the bank announced the results of its technical maneuver: the banks had taken $630 billion as part of the program. In the weeks that followed, the banks appear to have used a sizable share of the cash to buy the European bonds so desperately in need of customers. It was as if the European Central Bank had injected lenders with steroids, then asked them to do the heavy lifting. The strategy appears to be paying off. Even in the face of recession warnings and the agency's downgrades, the European debt market keeps improving.
Financial experts say the central bank's intervention seems to have catalyzed a virtuous circle: As new governments come in and promise to deliver spending cuts, tax increases and balanced budgets, once gun-shy banks have an added incentive to tap new financing from the central bank and jump back into bond markets that they were running from just a few months ago.
The question now is whether the E.C.B.'s action merely delayed the inevitable reckoning for the euro zone's weakest members or whether falling interest rates and improved growth will become entrenched, bringing the critical phase of the Continent's debt crisis to a close.
"I think that they have mastered it to the extent that this isn't going to get a whole lot worse," said Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, a research fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. "We do have in my opinion fairly credible signs of stabilization."
The central bank under its previous chairman, Jean-Claude Trichet, had long resisted more aggressive action, unwilling to flood the market with money the way the Fed did in 2008 until governments committed to reining in spending and deregulating their economies. "By refusing to act decisively at an early stage, they in a sense perpetuated the crisis, creating a situation where in the end the euro-area politicians had no other choice than to do the right thing," Mr. Kirkegaard said.
The central bank is preparing another infusion in February, and many banking experts expect it to be even bigger. The unspoken quid pro quo -- that banks need to buy government debt in exchange for the central bank's largess -- seems to be working.
The strategy is not without risks, warned Thomas Mayer, chief economist at Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt. "It may please some of the purists as it looks purer, but the banks may become addicted," Mr. Mayer said. There is a limit to how much of this debt the banks can buy, he said. "Near-term relief of government bond deals may come at the cost of making the banks' balance sheets more toxic."
Policy makers say they are aware that all the central bank has done is give them breathing room to set their houses in order; the bonds are due in just three years. So the summit meeting of European leaders scheduled for Jan. 30 is likely to focus on finding ways to spur growth as well as on reining in budget deficits.
"The fetishizing of austerity by European leaders, clamping down on growth so severely, may create political backlash that will not be manageable," said Kathleen R. McNamara, director of the Mortara Center for International Studies at Georgetown University. "But I give kudos to the E.C.B. for managing what really has been a tightrope situation."
The amounts the central bank has spent directly are much smaller than some economists and political leaders would like, but over time have grown substantial. It has spent $280 billion intervening in government debt markets since May 2010. Last week alone, it spent nearly $5 billion in bond markets.
The political deliberations and negotiations in Brussels and, increasingly, in Berlin have been as important as the central bank's moves. They were a precondition for the bank's actions, and continue to carry importance.
"I don't think it's a coincidence that this happened only after we had a change of government in Italy and Spain," said Mr. Kirkegaard, the research fellow. "From the perspective of the E.C.B., they have fairly consistently in my opinion not done anything big in this crisis without getting a big juicy quid pro quo," he said.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Two years ago, President Obama popped a surprise into his State of the Union address: His administration would double American exports in five years, helping to create two million jobs.
The bold promise sent the eyebrows of economists and policy experts upward, even as they applauded its intent.
"How will he perform this miracle?" Leslie H. Gelb, president emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations, asked at the time. "It really is a mystery."
Two years later, the administration is on track -- for now -- to meet its ambitious goal. Growing exports have been one of the central drivers of the recovery, accounting for about half the nation's economic growth since the recession ended. Economists say the administration deserves credit for some of the gains. It has pressured China to increase the value of its currency and open its markets to American businesses. It has worked closely with American companies looking to sell goods and services throughout the world.
Exports are running at about $180 billion a month, according to Commerce Department data, up from $140 billion a month two years ago. They are currently growing at an annual pace of about 16 percent -- a percentage-point higher than necessary to double exports to $3.1 trillion by 2015.
But while economists and trade experts praise the export boomlet, they warn that some of the reasons behind the rise, including announcing the goal when exports were at a low point, may be waning.
"I'd say 90 percent is due to macro trends," said Gary C. Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. "You could say the best thing the Obama administration did for trade is the stimulus program," bolstering domestic and global demand, he added.
That will not stop Mr. Obama from promoting export success in his State of the Union address on Tuesday. The White House pushed through three long-stalled free-trade deals, with Colombia, Panama and South Korea. In November, it also announced the framework for a trade and investment agreement among nine Pacific nations, the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
"If we're going to grow, it's going to be because of exports," Mr. Obama told a meeting of business executives at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meetings in Hawaii in November.
Trade experts say those changes have done some good -- but note that American exports got a major boost from economic trends over the last two years, including a global rebound from the depths of the recession and rising prices for commodities, like wheat, cotton and petroleum products.
Indeed, the Obama administration started its five-year clock when global trade volumes were near their recession-era lows. Manufacturing exports of goods like airplanes and machinery, for instance, have snapped back to nearly their prerecession peak.
"We've had 15 percent growth," said Andrew B. Bernard, a professor at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth. "A lot of that is recovering -- just getting back to where normal life would be. And a lot of it has to do with the rapid recovery of our trading partners."
He said an "optimistic" -- but more realistic -- benchmark for annual export growth in the coming years was about 8 percent.
In the last two years, the recovery -- and roaring demand from developing countries -- also helped to drive up prices for commodities to the benefit of American farmers, miners and energy companies. Farm exports reached a record $137.4 billion in the 2011 fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, beating the previous annual peak by $22.5 billion, or 20 percent. Sales of petroleum products also hit a record of about $90 billion in 2011, making fuels the country's single biggest export.
"Coming out of global economic recession, trade does tend to come back faster," said Ron Kirk, the United States trade representative.
But, he said, "the export initiative is real. And the success has been, actually, pretty remarkable," he said. "We're doing everything we can to facilitate trade, knock down barriers and do export promotion."
Still, the global trends that aided American export growth in the last two years appear to be diminishing, and 2012 poses new headwinds.
First, global investors are flocking to the safety of the stronger dollar in light of the crisis in Europe. That has pushed the borrowing costs of the United States to near-record lows. But it makes American exports relatively more expensive and might mean that developing economies will turn to cheaper, euro-denominated goods and services.
More worrying is a global slowdown and easing commodity prices. Europe, the nation's biggest trading partner, is on the brink of recession. And the International Monetary Fund and World Bank are also warning that the emerging-market economies that provided the bulk of growth in the global recovery are cooling off.
A financial crisis in the euro zone could slash global trade by more than 7 percent, the World Bank forecast this week. And even if Europe merely muddles through, the bank expects global trade growth of 4.7 percent in 2012, down from 12.4 percent two years ago.
An emerging-market slowdown might prove even more consequential for American exporters than woes in rich European countries. Much of the export growth in the last two years has come from countries like China, South Korea, Brazil and India, and developing countries now buy a majority of exported goods and services. Sales of goods to China, for instance, have grown fivefold over the last decade -- while exports to all countries have roughly doubled.
Many forecasters remain optimistic that exports will continue expanding in 2012, if not quite as quickly. And the long-term trends remain in the favor of the United States, as growing emerging-market economies move hundreds of millions of consumers into the middle class.
"There's a view that there's more potential" for American exports to China, a senior administration official said.
"If there were a stronger and better market opening, a better playing field and more protection of intellectual property and trade secrets, we could be doing more business with each other."
In this year's State of the Union, the White House is expected to announce new measures to help bolster trade, including a new task force to monitor and enforce trade rules.

Full text: Mitt Romney said during Thursday night's debate that he did not inherit any money from his parents.
This is not entirely accurate, according to Mr. Romney's previous remarks on the topic, and it was one of several questionable assertions made by the candidates in the debate.
In an interview with C-Span in March 2006, Mr. Romney said that upon the death of his father, George, the former chief executive of American Motors, he received an inheritance. But he quickly donated the money to Brigham Young University, he said. (The younger Mr. Romney and his wife, Ann, attended the college, which is tied to the Mormon Church.)
"I did get a check from my dad when he passed away," Mr. Romney told Brian Lamb during the interview. "I shouldn't say a check, but I did inherit some funds from my dad.
"But I turned and gave that away to charity," Mr. Romney said. "In this case I gave it to a school which Brigham Young University established in his honor, the George W. Romney School of Public Management."
He continued: "And as an institute of public management, it helps young people learn about government and about serving in public service. And that's where his inheritance ended up."
Even so, Mr. Romney benefited from his father's wealth in another way: he relied on George Romney for a loan that he used to buy his first home, in Belmont, Mass., for $42,000.
Gaps in the Work Force
The moderator of the debate, John King of CNN, told the candidates that Apple, the consumer technology giant, employs more than 400,000 people in China, and asked what they would do to bring those manufacturing jobs back to the United States.
Rick Santorum said he would eliminate taxes on manufacturing. Representative Ron Paul of Texas said he would cut back on regulation.
In his biography of Steve Jobs, the Apple founder, Walter Isaacson relates the answer to that question that Mr. Jobs gave to President Obama.
At a dinner party in Silicon Valley, Mr. Jobs told the president that the company needed 30,000 engineers to support those factory workers.
"You can't find that many in America to hire," Mr. Jobs said.
Mr. Isaacson wrote: "These factory engineers did not have to be Ph.D.'s or geniuses; they simply needed to have basic engineering skills for manufacturing. Tech schools, community colleges or trade schools could train them."
"If you could educate these engineers," Mr. Jobs said, "we could move more manufacturing plants here."
Not taxes. Not regulation. Education. BINYAMIN APPELBAUM
Financing for Abortions
Newt Gingrich, citing "facts we've validated," accused Mr. Romney of presiding over a number of measures as Massachusetts governor that allowed state support of abortions.
He said that Mr. Romney's state health care plan allowed for abortions paid by taxpayers, and that it included a role for Planned Parenthood but none for a representative from an anti-abortion group.
Mr. Romney replied that there was a "scintilla" of truth in these assertions but said Mr. Gingrich was distorting the health care law to tar him falsely as insufficiently opposed to abortion. He has a persuasive case.
The health care overhaul law that Mr. Romney signed does not mention abortion coverage. The agency overseeing the system later decided to cover abortion because of rulings by the Massachusetts Supreme Court, which Mr. Romney had no control over.
Mr. Gingrich has suggested while campaigning that Mr. Romney might have gotten around this by finding a way to ignore the court (as he has suggested a president could ignore United States Supreme Court rulings). However, it is not fully accurate to state that Mr. Romney's health care law included "tax-paid" abortions.
The law does empower Planned Parenthood to appoint one person to a 14-member advisory board, with no provision for an anti-abortion group to name a representative. But the board is a technical one that reviews Medicaid rates. It does not have a role in deciding whether to pay for abortions. TRIP GABRIEL
Manufacturing Jobs
At one point in the debate, Mr. Santorum said he would eliminate taxes on American manufacturers to increase their competitiveness. He said that employment in manufacturing had declined to 9 percent of the labor force from 21 percent.
The numbers are basically correct, but it is important to understand the reason.
American factories produce more goods now, worth more money, than at any other point in history. The nation's manufacturing output has more than doubled since 1970, adjusting for inflation.
But factories have also become much more efficient, so that the number of jobs in manufacturing has plummeted even as output has soared.
American manufacturers, in other words, are doing fine. They are highly competitive. But there is little prospect that they will start hiring large numbers of workers. Taxes or no taxes, they do not need more bodies on the factory floor.

Abstract: The 10-year Treasury bond rate is 1.87 percent. Since inflation is higher than that, real rates are actually below zero, meaning that a lender to the United States government will get back less money in 10 years than it started with.

Full text: Imagine how Mitt Romney would campaign if he actually ran as a private equity executive, dangerous though that may be in this era of the Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street.
Aggressively attacked by a super PAC supporting Newt Gingrich, Mr. Romney stands accused of being a rapacious capitalist intent on destroying jobs for personal gain. Mr. Romney has responded: Au contraire! He argues that his work at Bain Capital, one of the earliest and most successful private equity firms, created jobs by making companies more efficient and successful.
Many people on Wall Street are befuddled. After all, a private equity firm creating jobs is like Adam Sandler winning an Academy Award - it would be nice if it happened, but it sure wasn't the goal.
The goal, of course, is high returns.
If Mr. Romney were really running as a private equity executive, how would he view what his campaign regards as one of the nation's most pressing issues, the national debt?
Right at the top of his campaign's home page, Mr. Romney proclaims, "We have a moral responsibility not to spend more than we take in." The United States' debt is such a problem, it's like an addiction: "The first step toward recovery is admitting we have a problem and refusing to allow any more irresponsible borrowing," his site says.
It's almost as if Mr. Romney never worked in - what's that other phrase for private equity? - oh yes, a leveraged buyout firm. Leverage as in debt, debt and more debt. Debt amplifies the returns of L.B.O. firms. Indeed, they often saddle companies with extra debt precisely so that their investors can cash out faster, a technique Bain deployed under Mr. Romney's watch.
L.B.O. firms certainly never think of debt as immoral. When the borrowing is good, private equity is going to grab the money. When Mr. Romney rails against debt, he is running away from his entire career in business.
So what about the federal government? The 10-year Treasury bond rate is 1.87 percent. Since inflation is higher than that, real rates are actually below zero, meaning that a lender to the United States government will get back less money in 10 years than it started with.
That's right: When the government borrows, its lenders actually lose money. Yet foreigners and Americans, institutions and individuals alike are extraordinarily willing to shovel money at the United States government right now.
Are there private equity executives anywhere in the world who would counsel their companies not to borrow at such extremely low rates? I haven't had the privilege of meeting one. Their mantra is, borrow now, for tomorrow the Mayans might turn out to be right. Few indeed are the companies that could borrow that cheaply and not make some kind of return on essentially free money.
"If debt is available to you historically cheaply, it almost always makes sense to take it," said Shivan Govindan, a private equity executive for the Resource Financial Institutions Group. "Your capital strategy isn't something ideological. You are going to optimize it for the best mix."
So, by the logic of private equity, the United States government should borrow much more right now.
But what about the unsustainability of our debt? If a company has out-of-control costs and is spiraling toward default, it should not borrow more. True, but no company that is truly headed toward imminent default can borrow as cheaply as the American government.
If the United States government is headed toward bankruptcy, lenders are surely not acting that way. Maybe those people are making a good decision; maybe they are deluded. It doesn't matter to the borrower.
Of course, an issue for the United States, as for a company, is whether it could put the money to good use.
"Surely, government investments would have a real return in a 10-year period higher than zero, even with waste and corruption," said Paul L. Kasriel, an economist for Northern Trust. "This means that these investments will boost future real G.D.P. growth, which will boost future tax revenues to service the increased debt."
There will be bridges and roads that we must fix over the next decade. We could put more young people in college, improve elementary school education, train veterans so they can find good jobs or finance exploration of alternative fuels. People will quibble - or maybe, in our polarized culture, fight tooth and nail - over the choices, but most could think of something that would be a good investment.
On a deeper level, the debate over private equity raises questions about using the metaphor of America as a business. That kind of thinking can reduce society to the sum of its revenues and profits, ignoring that much of what we do to provide for the common defense and promote the general welfare cannot or should not be measured, especially in economic terms. We take care of our elderly because it is the right thing to do, not because we expect a return on investment. Shouldn't society promote and protect freedom and human rights? Even when there are times when doing so may be expensive or uneconomical?
There are moral issues that confront our country. Debt isn't one of them.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text: WASHINGTON (AP) -- Factory production in the United States has surged 15 percent above its lows of two and a half years ago and is helping drive the economy's recovery.
A jump in manufacturing output last month coincided with other data suggesting that the economy began 2012 with renewed vigor, and another report shows that wholesale prices are tame.
There appear to be signs "that manufacturing in the U.S. is gaining global market share," said John Ryding of RDQ Economics, "and this could be an important dynamic supporting growth in 2012."
Manufacturing rose 0.9 percent from November to December, the Federal Reserve said Wednesday. It was the biggest monthly gain since December 2010.
Overall output at the nation's factories, mines and utilities increased 0.4 percent. Warm weather reduced demand for energy produced by utilities.
Over the last year, factory output has risen 3.7 percent. Factories benefited in particular in the second half of 2011 from several trends. People bought more cars. Businesses spent more on industrial machinery and computers before a tax incentive expired. And companies restocked their supplies after cutting them last summer.
The growth has also fueled more hiring. Factories added 23,000 jobs in December, the most since July. That helped reduce the unemployment rate to 8.5 percent, the lowest level in nearly three years.
Still, Europe's debt crisis has begun to dampen demand for American exports. That trend, should it continue, could slow manufacturing and threaten growth this year.
December's gains suggest the industry "is still resistant to the apparent slowdown in growth elsewhere, particularly in Europe," said Paul Ashworth, chief United States economist with Capital Economics.
Businesses are starting to see some relief from high prices for energy and food, and that should benefit consumers later this year.
The Producer Price Index declined 0.1 percent in December, the Labor Department said Wednesday. The index measures price changes before they reach consumers.
Core wholesale prices, which exclude costs for food and energy, rose more sharply in December -- 0.3 percent. But economists played down the increase. They cited temporary factors that had pushed auto prices down in October and November.
Over all, wholesale prices are trending lower. They increased 4.8 percent in December compared with the same month a year ago, reflecting in part the effect of higher oil and other commodity prices. Even so, it is the slowest annual increase since January and down from 7.1 percent in July.
Falling prices for oil and agricultural commodities have lowered the cost of food and gas.
Gas prices have turned upward in recent months, but economists do not expect that to worsen inflation this year because prices will most likely be lower than last winter and spring, when political turmoil in North Africa and the Middle East sent prices up.
Lower wholesale costs mean manufacturers and retailers face less pressure to raise prices for consumers to maintain profits. That could keep consumer price inflation in check.
Lower inflation also gives the Federal Reserve leeway to keep short-term interest rates low and take other steps, if necessary, to bolster the economy.

World Bank Warns Developing Nations of Slowing Growth

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The World Bank is urging developing nations to start planning for a major slowdown in global growth this year.
In a report released Tuesday, the Washington-based bank lowered its growth forecasts for high-income and low-income countries, saying it expected the world economy to expand an aggregate 2.5 percent in 2012, down from about 2.7 percent in 2011. In its previous estimate, in June, it forecast growth of 3.6 percent in 2012.
The bank also warned of the continued threat of a global financial shock "similar in magnitude to the Lehman crisis," because of the possibility that a major European economy could be shut out of the global debt markets. In that case, the bank estimated the damage to the world's economic growth would rival the recession of 2008 and 2009.
"The largest economy in the world is weakening," Justin Yifu Lin, the bank's chief economist, said in an interview, referring to the European Union. "The message for developing countries is to start preparing now."
The report was issued as forecasters warned of slower growth in the United States. Estimates of the nation's annual pace of growth reached as high as 4 percent in the final months of 2011. But economists contend the strength came in part from temporary measures, including wholesalers restocking their inventories and consumers saving less and spending more over the holidays.
Economists say they expect many headwinds in early 2012: rising oil prices as the United States and European countries confront Iran; the risk of a tax cut for American wage earners expiring; a strong dollar rendering American exports less competitive; and continued repercussions from the sovereign debt crisis in Europe.
In the report, the biannual Global Economic Prospects, the bank predicted that high-income countries, including the United States, France, Japan and Germany, would grow 1.4 percent in 2012. It forecast a mild contraction of 0.3 percent in the 17 countries that use the euro. Developing countries will grow 5.4 percent, down from a forecast of 6.2 percent in June, the bank said.
The reason for the global slowdown is twofold, said Andrew Burns, head of global macroeconomics at the World Bank and the main author of the report. First, developing countries like Turkey, India, Russia and Brazil were "overheating" in the rebound after the recession and have tightened monetary policy to help curb inflation, he said. Second, he added, the euro zone crisis has frightened investors, and austerity budgets adopted in countries, including Italy and Greece, have weighed on growth.
Mr. Burns said those trends created a "dangerous dynamic," with the slowdown in emerging economies sapping growth from advanced economies, and the downturn in advanced economies worsening prospects for emerging markets. "The events are feeding off of one another," he said.
A worst case in Europe could lead to significant hardship for emerging economies, the report said. Commodity prices could fall as much as 24 percent, hurting government revenue in export-dependent nations. Global trade volumes could fall by more than 7 percent. Countries in Central Asia and Eastern Europe would be hit hardest, the bank said.
But even if catastrophe does not occur, growth looks weaker, the bank said. For instance, the World Bank estimates world trade will expand only 4.7 percent in 2012, down from 12.4 percent in 2010.
Last summer, the World Bank noted significant "contagion from Europe to developing countries," Mr. Burns said. Risk-averse investors slashed financing to emerging markets, with gross capital flows falling to $170 billion in the second half of 2011 from about $309 billion in the same period in 2010. In addition, borrowing costs began to rise in developing countries.
The bank said developing economies should prepare for declining investment from abroad, less-robust exports, and reduced remittances. Governments should rigorously stress test their financial institutions, plan major infrastructure projects to help support demand and ensure the viability of their social safety nets, the report said.
Mr. Lin said advanced economies should consider more immediate fiscal stimulus to support growth, locally and globally. "They need to carry out structural reforms in the long-term," he said. "But in the short term, they need an intervention to provide a short-term boost to demand."
He warned that emerging markets have less room for fiscal and monetary stimulus than they did in 2008 and 2009, even though they have more capacity than many developed countries. Many high-income countries, including the United States, are already struggling with heavy debt loads, limiting the possibility of fiscal stimulus. And central banks have already overextended their balance sheets and pushed interest rates close to zero, limiting monetary stimulus, Mr. Burns said in an interview.
The International Monetary Fund, the World Bank's sister organization, echoed its warnings about the dangers slowing trade and uncertainty about Europe pose to emerging markets.
In a speech Monday, David Lipton, the fund's first deputy managing director, said there was reason for optimism, given the lessons learned in the 2008 crisis. But, he warned: "Europe could be swept into a downward spiral of collapsing confidence, stagnant growth and fewer jobs. And in today's interconnected global economy, no country and no region would be immune from that catastrophe."
The fund is expected to update its World Economic Outlook on Jan. 24. It said it would cut its growth forecast from predictions it issued last September.
World Bank officials emphasized the importance of confidence, given uncertainty about Europe and worries about slowing growth. Mr. Burns said investor sentiment "could have an enormous impact cumulatively."

Full text: OVER the holiday, the Securities and Exchange Commissionrevised one of the wealth requirements for people seeking to invest in private offerings that hold the allure of big returns. It was a small change, mandated by the Dodd-Frank regulatory overhaul law.
But it has broader implications. Should the United States government be deciding what people can do with their money? And how do you define who is wealthy enough -- and smart enough -- to invest in these offerings?
We're talking about private placements -- a term the financial industry uses for anything from real estate deals to hedge funds to last year's much-talked-about offering in Facebook shares. What all these investments have in common is that they can be sold with fewer disclosures than public offerings.
They also often carry cachet, and those who get into them can end up with large returns. That may seem unfair to anyone excluded because of a lack of wealth. But these private investments can go to zero just as easily as they can climb into the stratosphere, which is why investors who cannot afford to lose a lot of money are barred.
Since 1982, specific dollar amounts have been used to define who is an "accredited investor," the S.E.C.'s term for someone deemed sophisticated enough to invest in these nonpublic deals.
The two most commonly used measures are annual income -- over $200,000 for an individual or $300,000 for a couple -- and net worth, which was $1 million. In late December, the S.E.C. redefined how people should calculate their net worth. Per the requirements of Dodd-Frank, the commission removed the equity in a person's primary residence from consideration. (But if the value of that house is less than the mortgage, that liability needs to be included.)
"It's an interesting question as to why this qualifies someone as sophisticated," said Robert E. Buckholz Jr., a partner at Sullivan & Cromwell. "The income and the net worth requirements are a proxy for the ability to fend for yourself."
But also in compliance with Dodd-Frank, the S.E.C. will spend the next three years determining whether to make further changes in the accredited investor requirements. While it is hard to say what the review will produce, it is worthwhile to look at how wealth and financial expertise have been confused.
WHAT THE RULE DOES In a 2009 article in The Washington University Law Review, Wallis K. Finger, now an associate at Schulte Roth & Zabel, used humor to lay out the problem of using money as a proxy for sophistication.
"Paris Hilton almost certainly can purchase unregulated securities issued by hedge funds or other private investment vehicles," Ms. Finger wrote. "Although her training and sophistication in the field of high-stakes financial transactions may be limited, the Securities and Exchange Commission would leave her to her own devices if she chose to invest in private offerings."
For comparison, she created a woman named Sheryl who has a master's degree in business from Harvard and a doctorate in financial systems analysis. "After all of this schooling, Sheryl is long on debt and short on assets," Ms. Finger wrote. "She has several offers to work at the nation's most prestigious investment brokerages. But if Sheryl wants to invest in a private offering, the S.E.C. regulations will not allow it."
In other words, using money as a stand-in for financial sophistication is a fairly unsophisticated solution.
When news leaked out last year that Goldman Sachs was planning to offer private shares in Facebook to its wealthiest clients, there was outrage from people who were excluded. After much media attention, the firm limited the private offering to overseas clients to be sure it complied with S.E.C. regulations. (Anyone will be able to buy shares in the initial public offering of Facebook.)
In reality, most private offerings are far less glamorous and carry significant risks.
Barbara Black, a professor and director of the corporate law center at the University of Cincinnati College of Law, said she was more concerned about small offerings, like a local real estate partnership, where an entrepreneur tries to raise money by promising outsize returns to investors in the community.
"It may be perfectly fine, but the nature of things is that these are risky," Ms. Black said. "You see litigation involving people who are wealthy, but you don't think of them as super-rich -- doctors, dentists, lawyers, some accountants. Are these really sophisticated investors?"
DOES IT WORK? The accredited investor regulation is by design paternalistic, but its arbitrariness is what bothers people.
Originally, the Securities Act of 1933 aimed to provide more information on securities to prevent investors from being manipulated. Those who were exempted from these requirements were believed to possess enough knowledge to make informed choices.
Using the example of doctors and lawyers investing in a local real estate deal, Yasho Lahiri, a partner at law firm Baker Botts in New York, said investors would be better protected with more disclosures, not by their degree of wealth.
"What these rules do is limit that amount of information," he said. "If all these real estate documents were out there, you could assess the deals and compare them to others."
He added that really sophisticated investments were not marketed to accredited investors anyway. They go to qualified purchasers who have at least $5 million in assets that can be invested and qualified institutional buyers with over $100 million.
If the goal, though, is to protect people from losing all of their money in an illiquid investment, the current standard fails on that count, too. Andrew Abramowitz, a lawyer in Manhattan who has worked with both buyers and sellers of private placements, said a better standard might be to limit how much of their net worth people can invest.
"There could also be a prohibition on participation in a new private placement if the investor's previous investments in illiquid securities constitute a specified share of investor's liquid assets," he said.
At the very least, the dollar amounts have not been changed since they were put in place in 1982, and people who qualify today would not have qualified then. After all, $1 million from 1982 would be worth $2.34 million today. Indexing for inflation had been proposed for Dodd-Frank but was removed in Congressional negotiations.
OTHER OPTIONS There are all sorts of alternatives to the accredited investor standard. The tough part is turning recommendations into regulations, especially since the S.E.C. faces opposition from groups that depend on a big pool of investors for private placements.
Walter J. Woerheide, the vice president of academic affairs at the American College, which focuses on training financial service professionals, suggested a simple test to determine a person's level of financial knowledge, akin to the test for a driver's license.
John C. Coffee Jr., a professor at Columbia University School of Law, said the rule should be changed to require a minimum net worth of $5 million and to set a standard for diversification so that no more than 15 to 20 percent of someone's net worth could be in unregulated investments.
He said he was particularly concerned about legislation being considered by the Senate that would eliminate the current requirement that brokers need to have an existing relationship with clients before they can try to sell them private placements.
"Upper-middle-class Americans who qualify as accredited investors will soon begin receiving streams of unsolicited offers from brokers they do not know for unregistered offerings," Mr. Coffee said. "From a consumer protection standpoint, this combination of little sophistication and even less disclosure seems troubling."
And if that happens, investors may have to become more honest in assessing what they know.

Full text: The United States trade deficit widened in November to its largest point in five months, prompting some economists to slightly rein in growth expectations for the fourth quarter.
A separate survey released on Friday showed that consumer sentiment hit an eight-month high in early January as Americans grew more optimistic about job prospects.
The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary January reading on its overall index of consumer sentiment rose to 74 from 69.9 in December for the fifth month of gains and the highest level since May 2011.
The report topped expectations of 71.5 and contrasted with December's weaker-than-expected retail sales reported on Thursday.
"This shows even though the retail sales number this week was disappointing, there could be a little more underlying strength," said Kathy Lien, director of research at GFT Forex in Jersey City. "I'd be wary of looking at this as a shift in long-term confidence, but I'd look at this as good news today."
Commerce Department data showed that the trade gap was $47.8 billion in November, exceeding analysts' forecast of a $45 billion deficit.
"The trade balance deteriorated pretty significantly, and it could shave a few tenths of a percent off our expectation for fourth quarter," said Russell Price, senior economist at Ameriprise Financial.
JPMorgan Chase said gross domestic product growth for the fourth quarter was now tracking closer to 3 percent than the company's forecast of 3.5 percent.
A wider deficit shows that more goods and services bought by American businesses and consumers were produced outside the country, subtracting from gross domestic product.
"The external outlook does not bode well for U.S. exports, as a deceleration in global growth will coincide with a stronger U.S. dollar due to lingering financial concerns regarding Europe's sovereign debt turbulences," wrote Martin Schwerdtfeger, a senior economist at the TD Bank Group, in a note.
A dip in import prices showed that inflation pressures were still muted, giving the Federal Reserve wiggle room as it holds benchmark interest rates at ultralow levels.
Import prices were down 0.1 percent in December after a 0.8 percent gain in November as oil prices fell, in line with economists' expectations.
Economic growth in the final quarter of 2011 is likely to have accelerated from the third quarter's 1.8 percent rate, with many economists expecting an annualized rise of around 3 percent.
Consumer spending, once a crucial pillar of the economy, remains lackluster and sensitive to shocks.
Although some Federal Reserve officials have said further steps may be needed to stimulate the economy, no action is expected at the next Fed policy meeting at the end of the month.
Thirty-four percent of consumers polled in the confidence survey said they had heard of recent job gains, a record high in the survey's history and well above the 21 percent recorded in December.
"The data suggest a stronger consumer spending outlook, rising to about a 2.1 percent gain in 2012," Richard Curtin, the survey director, said in a statement.
But consumers still lacked confidence in government economic policies, with the majority rating them unfavorably for the sixth consecutive month.
Americans also remained dour on their personal finances, with just 24 percent expecting their finances to improve in January, compared with 25 percent last month.
The survey's barometer of current economic conditions rose to the highest level since February at 82.6, from 79.6, while its gauge of consumer expectations rose to 68.4 from 63.6.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- As the housing bubble entered its waning hours in 2006, top Federal Reserve officials marveled at the desperate antics of home builders seeking to lure buyers.
The officials laughed about the cars that builders were offering as signing bonuses, and about efforts to make empty homes look occupied. They joked about one builder who said that inventory was "rising through the roof."
But the officials, meeting every six weeks to discuss the health of the nation's economy, gave little credence to the possibility that the faltering housing market would weigh on the broader economy, according to transcripts that the Fed released Thursday. Instead they continued to tell one another throughout 2006 that the greatest danger was inflation -- the possibility that the economy would grow too fast.
"We think the fundamentals of the expansion going forward still look good," Timothy F. Geithner, then president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, told his colleagues when they gathered in Washington in December 2006.
Some officials, including Susan Bies, a Fed governor, suggested that a housing downturn actually could bolster the economy by redirecting money to other kinds of investments.
And there was general acclaim for Alan Greenspan, who stepped down as chairman at the beginning of the year, for presiding over one of the longest economic expansions in the nation's history. Mr. Geithner suggested that Mr. Greenspan's greatness still was not fully appreciated, an opinion now held by a much smaller number of people.
Meanwhile, by the end of 2006, the economy already was shrinking by at least one important measure, total income. And by the end of the next year, the Fed had started its desperate struggle to prevent the collapse of the financial system and to avert the onset of what could have been the nation's first full-fledged depression in about 70 years.
The transcripts of the 2006 meetings, released after a standard five-year delay, clearly show some of the nation's pre-eminent economic minds did not fully understand the basic mechanics of the economy that they were charged with shepherding. The problem was not a lack of information; it was a lack of comprehension, born in part of their deep confidence in economic forecasting models that turned out to be broken.
"It's embarrassing for the Fed," said Justin Wolfers, an economics professor at the University of Pennsylvania. "You see an awareness that the housing market is starting to crumble, and you see a lack of awareness of the connection between the housing market and financial markets."
"It's also embarrassing for economics," he continued. "My strong guess is that if we had a transcript of any other economist, there would be at least as much fodder."
Many of the officials who appear in the transcripts have since spoken publicly about the Fed's failings in the years before the crisis. But the transcripts provide a raw and detailed account of those errors as they were made. Evidence of problems in the housing market accumulated at each meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets policy for the central bank.
"We are getting reports that builders are now making concessions and providing upgrades, such as marble countertops and other extras, and in one case even throwing in a free Mini Cooper to sweeten the deal," George C. Guynn, then president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, said at the June meeting.
The committee consists of the governors of the Federal Reserve and the presidents of the 12 regional banks.
"The speed of the falloff in housing activity and the deceleration in house prices continue to surprise us," Janet Yellen, then president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said in September.
One builder she spoke with, she said, "toured some new subdivisions on the outskirts of Boise and discovered that the houses, most of which are unoccupied, are now being dressed up to look occupied -- with curtains, things in the driveway, and so forth -- so as not to discourage potential buyers."
For a famously private institution known for its cryptic, formulaic statements, the meeting transcripts offer a rare glimpse of senior officials in relatively unguarded conversation, somewhat akin to the tapes that some presidents have made in the Oval Office. The Fed officials exchange jokes, gossip about people who are not present, and speak much more frankly about the economy and policy than they did in the public remarks that they made contemporaneously.
The results are unlikely to burnish any of their reputations, inasmuch as they could not see the widening cracks beneath their feet. But the Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, appears as the most consistent voice of warning that problems in the housing market could have broader consequences.
The general consensus on the board, summarized by Mr. Geithner, was that problems in the housing market had few broader ramifications. "We just don't see troubling signs yet of collateral damage, and we are not expecting much," he said at the September meeting.
Mr. Bernanke initially agreed, telling colleagues at his first meeting as chairman, in March, "I think we are unlikely to see growth being derailed by the housing market."
As the year rolled along, however, Mr. Bernanke increasingly took the view that his colleagues were too sanguine.
"I don't have quite as much confidence as some people around the table that there will be no spillover effect," he said.
As for Mr. Geithner, who became Treasury secretary in 2009, his spokesman, Anthony Coley, said, "Secretary Geithner was an early source of initiative at the Fed to reduce risk and make the financial system more resilient even before 2006."
Some Fed officials argued that a housing slowdown would be good for the broader economy.
"I really believe that the drop in housing is actually on net going to make liquidity available for other sectors rather than being a drain going forward, and that will also get the growth rate more positive," Ms. Bies told colleagues at the committee's June meeting. Ms. Bies could not be reached for comment Thursday.
And even Ms. Yellen did not believe that the problems in the housing market would have broader consequences. "Of course, housing is a relatively small sector of the economy, and its decline should be self-correcting," she said.
One fundamental reason for this blindness was that Fed officials did not understand how deeply intertwined the housing sector and financial markets had become. They also were convinced that financial innovations, by distributing the risk of losses more broadly, had increased the strength and resilience of the system as a whole.
"I would say that the capital markets are probably more profitable and more robust at this moment, or at least going into the six-week opportunity, than they have perhaps ever been," Kevin Warsh, the Fed governor who watched Wall Street most closely, said at the meeting in September 2006. Three months later Mr. Warsh said almost exactly the same thing. He did not respond to an e-mail seeking comment Thursday.
For the Fed 2006 began with the departure of Mr. Greenspan, who presided in January over his final meeting as Fed chairman and was then widely regarded as the epitome of a central banker, a master who had guided the American economy through almost 20 years of remarkably consistent growth.
"I'd like the record to show that I think you're pretty terrific, too," Mr. Geithner said in adding his voice to the chorus of tributes at that final meeting. "And thinking in terms of probabilities, I think the risk that we decide in the future that you're even better than we think is higher than the alternative."
Ms. Yellen said: "It's fitting for Chairman Greenspan to leave office with the economy in such solid shape. The situation you're handing off to your successor is a lot like a tennis racquet with a gigantic sweet spot."

Full text: Economic expansion improved last month across most of the country while hiring was limited and housing remained stagnant, the Federal Reserve said on Wednesday.
The economy "expanded at a modest to moderate pace" from late November through the end of December on increased holiday retail sales, demand for services and oil-and-gas extraction, the Fed said in its beige book business survey. At the same time, most industries saw "limited permanent hiring," and the housing market remained "sluggish."
The report may reinforce the views of a majority of Fed officials, who see an economy that is expanding without being strong enough to reduce joblessness as quickly as they would prefer. The unemployment rate dropped to 8.5 percent in December from 9.4 percent a year earlier. Fed officials are urging lawmakers to try more housing-aid programs.
"The reports on balance suggest ongoing improvement in economic conditions in recent months," the Fed said in the report, which comes out two weeks before each meeting on monetary policy. "The combination of limited permanent hiring in most sectors and numerous active job seekers has continued to keep a lid on general wage increases."
The beige book report reflects a "slightly better tone, slightly better data," said Joseph LaVorgna, chief United States economist at Deutsche Bank Securities in New York. Even so, "the financial market has taken recent Fed commentary as generally dovish and as a signal that the Fed is perhaps exploring more easing measures."
The last beige book, released Nov. 30, said the economy expanded at a "slow to moderate" pace in 11 of 12 districts, led by gains in manufacturing and consumer spending. St. Louis was the only region to report a decline in economic activity.
The Federal Open Market Committee will meet Jan. 24-25 in Washington as officials debate whether to try new actions to lower borrowing costs. Fed policy makers will for the first time publish projections for the benchmark federal funds rate and will also update their forecasts for economic growth, unemployment and inflation.
The beige book said that "upward wage pressures were modest over all" for workers across the country. The Labor Department said Jan. 6 that 200,000 jobs were added to payrolls in December, the most since September. The jobless rate declined for a fourth consecutive month to the lowest since February 2009.
Even so, the New York Fed president, William C. Dudley, said last week that the "outlook for unemployment is unacceptably high" and that it was appropriate for the Fed to consider steps to ease monetary policy.
The residential real estate market "largely held steady at very low levels" except for increasing construction of multifamily homes, the beige book said. The rental market tightened in some areas, the report said.
The Fed said in the report that inflation and pressures to raise prices were limited at the end of last year. Several district banks reported that "upward price pressures from rising commodity and input prices have eased substantially," the Fed said.
Lending edged up on higher demand from businesses, with the New York and Cleveland regions reporting increased loans in commercial mortgages, the Fed said.
Consumer lending "was largely flat compared with the prior reporting period," the central bank said.
A separate Fed report Jan. 9 showed that consumer borrowing in the United States rose in November by the most in 10 years. Credit increased by $20.4 billion, the biggest jump since November 2001, to $2.48 trillion.
Most regions said that holiday retail sales "were up noticeably over last year's season," and that consumer spending and confidence had improved, the Fed said.
Commercial and industrial loans from banks have increased to $1.34 trillion as of Dec. 28, the highest since October 2009, from $1.21 trillion a year earlier. They peaked at $1.62 trillion in October 2008.

Abstract: Since November 2010, when Myanmar's rulers held nominally free elections and released Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi after 15 years of house arrest, the boycott has been lifted and Myanmar is set for an influx of visitors. Because the country has been so isolated, the deeply Buddhist "Land of the Golden Pagoda" resonates with a strong sense of place, undiluted by mass tourism and warmed by genuine hospitality.

1. Panama
Go for the canal. Stay for everything else.
It's been 12 years since Panama regained control of its canal, and the country's economy is booming. Cranes stalk the skyline of the capital, Panama City, where high-rises sprout one after the next and immigrants arrive daily from around the world. Among those who have landed en masse in recent years are American expatriates and investors, who have banked on Panamanian real estate by building hotels and buying retirement homes. The passage of the United States-Panama free trade agreement in October is expected to accelerate this international exchange of people and dollars (the countries use the same currency).
Among the notable development projects is the Panama Canal itself, which is in the early stages of a multibillion-dollar expansion. The project will widen and deepen the existing canal and add two locks, doubling the canal's cargo capacity. For those who want to see the waterway as it was originally designed, now is the time. The expansion is expected to be completed by 2014, the canal's 100-year anniversary.
Other high-profile projects include the construction of three firsts: The Panamera, the first Waldorf Astoria hotel in Latin America (set to open in June 2012); the Trump Ocean Club, the region's tallest building, which opened last summer; and Frank Gehry's first Latin American design, the BioMuseo, a natural history museum scheduled to open in early 2013. Even Panama City's famously dilapidated historic quarter, Casco Viejo, has been transformed. The neighborhood, a tangle of narrow streets, centuries-old houses and neo-colonial government buildings, was designated a Unesco World Heritage site in 1997 and is now a trendy arts district with galleries, coffeehouses, street musicians and some of the city's most stylish restaurants and boutique hotels.
Across the isthmus, on Panama's Caribbean coast, the Bocas del Toro archipelago has become a popular stop on the backpacker circuit, with snorkeling and zip lining by day and raucous night life after dark. FREDA MOON
2. Helsinki, Finland
Design. Design. Design. Aesthetics fuel a new cool.
Copenhagen's culinary awakening and Stockholm's trend-setting fashion may have ignited the world's current infatuation with Nordic culture; now Helsinki is poised for the spotlight. The International Council of Societies of Industrial Design has designated it the World Design Capital for 2012.
Design has long been part of the city's DNA, but in recent years the scene has been increasingly energized: the official Design District has ballooned to encompass 25 streets and nearly 200 design-minded businesses, which range from shops selling housewares and furniture to boutique hotels and clothing stores. Design has infiltrated the restaurant scene as well, notably the elegant Chez Dominique and the hot newcomer (and Michelin-starred) Olo.
On top of all that is the spectacular new $242 million Helsinki Music Center. Student ensembles from the Sibelius Academy -- the sole university in Finland devoted exclusively to music -- will perform in the striking glass-walled space, and both the Vienna Philharmonic and the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestras will give concerts in 2012. INGRID K. WILLIAMS
3. Myanmar
Back on the tourist map after being off-limits for years.
With renowned cultural treasures, world-class boutique hotels and deserted beaches, Myanmar has long been high on intrepid travelers' wish lists. For years, though, heeding calls by the pro-democracy leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and others, many stayed away in protest of Myanmar's authoritarian regime.
Now, however, this is changing.
Since November 2010, when Myanmar's rulers held nominally free elections and released Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi after 15 years of house arrest, the boycott has been lifted and Myanmar is set for an influx of visitors.
Because the country has been so isolated, the deeply Buddhist "Land of the Golden Pagoda" resonates with a strong sense of place, undiluted by mass tourism and warmed by genuine hospitality. Travelers will find atmospheric hotels and a network of well-maintained regional jets serving the main sites. (Keep in mind that visas are still required and that the economy remains largely cash-based.)
But locals are aware of the potential downside of tourism as well. Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi has called for sustainable development and "trickle down" tourism where dollars will do the most good.
With these goals in mind, nestled along the banks of meandering Lake Inle in eastern Myanmar, the ViewPoint eco-lodge combines locally sourced materials with individually tailored activities supporting the local economy (like garden-to-table lunches at an island village house).
Similarly, in Ngapali Beach -- a pristine swath of coastline on the Bay of Bengal -- the Amara Ocean Resort ratchets up the om factor with a hand-built spa. The resort finances relief projects in the Irrawaddy River delta. CEIL MILLER-BOUCHET
4. London
The Olympics! The Queen! Charles Dickens turns 200!
Dotted with construction sites, London is preparing for the pomp and circumstance of the Olympic Games and the Diamond Jubilee celebration of the Queen's 60th year on the throne. New stadiums, public spaces and shopping centers are emerging on the city's eastern edge, and on the western edge a 137-room Waldorf Astoria has opened on a 400-acre estate near Heathrow Airport.
But it's not all sport and royalty. On a street of chocolate-box Georgian houses in Bloomsbury, the Charles Dickens Museum is open, in time for the author's 200th birthday. Across town, Warner Brothers Studio Tour will open the Harry Potter studios to those keen to re-live the films. The Rolling Stones, celebrating their 50th anniversary, might tour again, with a possible finale here. And Robert Redford will inaugurate a London outpost of the Sundance Film festival at the O2 Arena in April.
Amid the hubbub, flashes of eccentricity emerge. If the Waldorf doesn't appeal, stay in an architect-designed boat, perched on the edge of a roof overlooking the Thames. Or visit the British outpost of Occupy London, which will be maintaining its tent city outside St. Paul's cathedral. RAVI SOMAIYA
5. Oakland, Calif.
New restaurants and bars beckon amid the grit.
Tensions have cooled since violence erupted at the recent Occupy Oakland protests, but the city's revitalized night-life scene has continued to smolder.
The historic Fox Theater reopened in 2009 and quickly cemented its status as one of the Bay Area's top music venues, drawing acts like Wilco and the Decemberists. Meanwhile, the city's ever more sophisticated restaurants are now being joined by upscale cocktail bars, turning once-gritty Oakland into an increasingly appealing place to be after dark. James Syhabout, the chef who earned Oakland its first (and only) Michelin star two years ago at Commis, followed up in May with the instant-hit Hawker Fare, a casual spot serving Asian street food. Big-name San Francisco chefs are now joining him. Daniel Patterson (of two-Michelin-star Coi) opened the restaurant Plum in late 2010 and an adjacent cocktail bar later, and another restaurant, called Haven, in the recently renovated Jack London Square last month.

6. Tokyo
With some tourists slow to return, greater opportunities for those who do.
The thought of traveling to Tokyo will most likely make some people nervous. Though the city is about 180 miles from the Fukushima Daiichi power plant, the site of the worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl -- and the State Department recommends travelers avoid only the area directly around the disaster site -- Tokyo has suffered as well, a problem of perception as much as reality.
But from another vantage point, it's a perfect time to visit. A decrease in tourism and business travel is making the city all the more accessible and welcoming. According to Laurent Vernhes, a founder and the chief executive of TabletHotels.com, a travel site with a curated list of distinctive lodging options, tourism hasn't yet returned to normal levels. "Rates are still down about 10 percent on average compared to the same time last year," Mr. Vernhes said.
When I visited the city in the fall, it was clear that it is still crackling with energy. But now it's possible to get a previously unthinkable last-minute reservation at one of the city's many world-class restaurants or a room in hotels usually booked solid. A Saturday night dinner at Kagurazaka Ishikawa, a pricey but discreet restaurant with three Michelin stars and an artful tasting menu? No problem. And lodging options for all budgets have gotten easier. Chances are you can find a room at the elegant Park Hyatt Tokyo, a luxurious high-rise, or at the Tokyo Ryokan, a family-run hotel with just three simple bedrooms that often are reserved well in advance.

Note: An earlier version of the subheading with this entry has been changed because it was unintentionally insensitive in making a link between last year's tragedy in Japan and the opportunity for tourism.
7. Tanzania
Coming into its own as an upscale safari destination.
For the last several years the number of tourists going to Tanzania has been edging up, according to East African travel specialists like Hippo Creek Safaris and Abercrombie & Kent. But it wasn't until several violent attacks on visitors to neighboring Kenya that the numbers really took off, as Tanzania started to absorb skittish Kenya-bound safari seekers.
Not that Tanzania is coasting along solely on Kenya's troubles; it's always had Mount Kilimanjaro, after all. And now other attractions are being discovered, too -- places like Gibb's Farm, a small lodge from which guests can hike to the Ngorongoro Crater area, a prime destination for big game viewing. In addition, the opening of exclusive safari reserves like the Singita Grumeti and the upscale camps managed by Nomad Tanzania and Chem Chem are evidence that the country's tourist infrastructure is becoming more sophisticated, perhaps even catching up to Kenya's. GISELA WILLIAMS
8. Chilean Patagonia
Proof that adventure doesn't have to mean roughing it.
With its mix of snowy peaks, pristine rain forest and network of virgin national parks, Chile is emerging as one of the world's adventure hot spots and now has a spate of rugged luxury lodges in which adventure-seekers can stay.
Puma Lodge, a glass-and-wood design showcase about an hour and a half south of Santiago, features heli-skiing through miles of untouched powder, and outside of Patagonia's Torres del Paine Park, the brand-new Tierra Patagonia offers activities like horseback riding over the steppes and boat outings on a glacial lake (while also offering creature comforts like a spa and a heated indoor pool). Meanwhile, the latest Singular property, which also opened in November outside the park, leads expeditions into the nearby glaciers. For custom trips, pioneers to the region like Cazenove & Loyd can help navigate the logistical challenges of criss-crossing Chile's dramatic landscapes. ONDINE COHANE
9. Lhasa, Tibet
New luxury hotels bring respite -- and controversy.
Tibet's holy capital is in the throes of a luxury-hotel boom. In Lhasa, this is news: not only is operating an upscale hotel at nearly 12,000 feet above sea level no small feat, but real-estate developments here are, almost by default, also culturally loaded.
The majestic, 162-room St. Regis Lhasa Resort has been in full operation since May. In 2010, a charming Tibetan-owned villa called the Lingtsang reopened as a boutique hotel with opulent, colorful woodwork and courtyard verandas. And coming soon are the sprawling InterContinental Resort Lhasa Paradise and the 284-room Shangri-La, both scheduled to open in 2013.
On the upside, it's the first time that travelers can get high-end amenities in a city where even basic hospitality has been a challenge. On the downside, the openings -- like Lhasa's booming population, new business districts and shopping malls -- are seen by many Tibetans and interested outsiders as more cultural colonization and exploitation of a sacred land. KIMBERLY BRADLEY
10. Havana, Cuba
The Cuban capital is once again within Americans' reach.
The only thing that lies between Americans and the sultry streets of Havana these days is the Florida Straits, since the Obama administration has widened the kind of travel allowed. A growing list of organizations have licenses to operate trips to Cuba, including National Geographic Expeditions, Austin-Lehman and the Center for Cuban Studies. There are also more flights from more American cities: Fort Lauderdale and Tampa recently joined New York, Miami and Los Angeles on the list, and Chicago will be added this year.
The "people-to-people" rules require Americans to interact with Cubans (sun-and-sand vacations are still prohibited) so tours involve meeting with art historians, organic farmers and others. Conveniently, new restaurants and bed-and-breakfasts, some in gorgeous colonial villas, have sprung up over the past year as the government has allowed more private enterprise. Havana is also gearing up for its 11th Biennial, from May 11 to June 11, which will draw more than 100 Cuban and international artists. VICTORIA BURNETT
11. Moscow
New cultural venues add a dash of the sacred and profane.
The extravagantly renovated Bolshoi Theater has been preening like a prima donna before the news media's flashbulbs since it reopened in October. And given the $760 million face-lift to the 236-year-old grand dame you can almost hear the czars applauding from their tombs.
But beyond the spotlight, two compelling museums have also made their debuts. The Russian Icon Museum is said to hold the largest private collection of Russian and Eastern Christian religious artwork (some 4,000 pieces). Admission to the museum is free.
You won't find many virgins or saints at Tochka G, whose name translates as "G Spot." With more than 3,000 sex-related items, the bounty includes everything from Soviet-era condoms to high-tech sex dolls to "Wrestling," a 2011 painting by the Russian artist Vera Donskaya-Khilko that depicts a buff Vladimir Putin and Barack Obama challenging each other with their cartoonishly oversized phalluses. In Russia, size does matter. SETH SHERWOOD
12. Glasgow
Zaha Hadid takes on a Scottish waterfront.
Scotland's second city now has a $115 million museum designed by Zaha Hadid to go with its shiny new harbor and river promenade.
The Riverside Museum, which opened in June, is housed in a stunning building on the waterfront, with a 3,000-piece collection devoted to Glasgow's rich shipbuilding and engineering past. Its location, along the River Clyde, was once home to many shipyards, and considered the economic heart of Glasgow. But when the industry left, the area stagnated.
Not anymore. Glasgow has spent more than a decade redeveloping 130 acres of derelict shipyard and unused dockland in an effort to restore the waterway to its former glory. Now there's a pleasant riverside walkway with steel street furniture, cobblestones from Victorian Glasgow and maritime paraphernalia. Lime trees are planted on both sides of the esplanade, and there are bicycle paths throughout. A new ferry stop for the Riverside Museum, which just saw its one-millionth visitor, marks the first time in around 50 years that this section of the river has had regular passenger service.

13. Puebla, Mexico
International mole festival. Need we say more?
May 5, 2012, is the 150-year anniversary of Cinco de Mayo, the date when, in 1862, an outmanned Mexican army defeated the French troops of Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte. The occasion will be marked with a fiesta in Puebla, the chief spot in Mexico that celebrates the holiday. Ahead of the May festival, the city, the affluent capital of one of Mexico's safest states, is building a light rail line similar to the one in Mexico City and renovating public spaces. Privately, Museo Amparo, which holds one of the country's most impressive collections of indigenous and colonial-era artifacts, has undergone a $17 million update and expansion.
But the city's biggest draw might be its famous mole poblano. The city is inaugurating an international mole festival which will begin on May 2. Hopes are that it will attract celebrity chefs like Rick Bayless, who recently took staff members to Puebla's Mural de los Poblanos restaurant for their annual employee trip. FREDA MOON
14. San Diego
With breweries and brewpubs, a sunny heaven for suds lovers.
Slide Show
Even in times of tight budgets, finely crafted beer remains a relatively approachable luxury, and few American regions have more brewing momentum than San Diego County. Maybe it's time, then, to think about building a beer safari in the land of sunshine, fish tacos and hopped-up American IPAs. Long established craft breweries like Karl Strauss Brewing Company and the cheeky Stone Brewing Company have mentored brewmasters and created demand for some seriously offbeat ales.
The area has long been a hotbed of garage-based hobbyists, so it's no surprise that the region also has a tradition of dedicated home brewing. The result is a cluster of small breweries, like the tiny but soon-to-expand Hess Brewing.
And there are numerous opportunities for rigorous but never dour beer tastings, at staggeringly comprehensive shops like Bottlecraft Beer Shop & Tasting Room and Pizza Port Bottle Shop, as well as beer-obsessed taverns like Hamilton's and O'Brien's and restaurants like Local Habit. Those looking for full immersion can pack a stein for the fourth annual San Diego Beer Week in November. SARA DICKERMAN
15. Halong Bay, Vietnam
New ways to visit a natural wonder in Southeast Asia.
Slide Show
Though Halong Bay, a staggering seascape of some 1,600 limestone islands and islets in the Gulf of Tonkin, formed over millions of years, there's never been a better time to visit. In November, the Unesco World Heritage site was provisionally named one of the world's "new seven wonders of nature" based on a global poll conducted by the Swiss foundation New7Wonders -- just as Vietnam Airlines announced the first-ever nonstop flights between London and Vietnam. Largely untouched by humans and topped with thick jungle flora, the rock formations rise dramatically in conical peaks and pillars from the surrounding waters, which feature offshore coral reefs, freshwater swamps, mangrove forests and sandy beaches. Visitors can now reach what Ho Chi Minh himself called "the wonder one cannot impart to others," on local junk boats, luxury cruises or a spate of new adventure tours offered by companies like InterAsia, World Expeditions and the Luxury Travel Group. CHARLY WILDER
16. Florence, Italy
A Renaissance city gets a contemporary kick.
Since 2009, Florence's youthful mayor, Matteo Renzi, has championed efforts to build a livable, living city that celebrates -- but is not yoked to -- its rich history (and historic riches). The result? An energized arts scene unfolding inside various medieval palazzi, ancient landmarks restored and reopened to the public for the first time in decades and restaurants abandoning traditional Tuscan staples for sophisticated contemporary food.
The grand 15th-century Palazzo Strozzi is now home to the Center for Contemporary Culture Strozzina and a destination for must-see events like the coming "Americans in Florence: Sargent and the American Impressionists," which opens in March. Spazi Urbani Contemporanei, an arts space occupying a 15th-century former monastery, now features works from emerging Italian artists. Last year, the 148- foot-tall 14th-century San Niccolo tower reopened to the public with one of the best panoramic views of the city. And in September, the flagship Gucci Museum made its debut in the historic Palazzo della Mercanzia.
The city's stock of refined hotel offerings has also been elevated by the opulent new St. Regis Florence, which opened in a palatial riverside palazzo in May, and the Grand Hotel Villa Cora, another five-star stunner near the Boboli Gardens. Even the once-staid Florentine dining scene has been reborn with new restaurants like IO Osteria Personale and Ossi di Seppia.
Next for the Tuscan capital are plans to restore the banks of the Arno River and spruce up the city's largest park. INGRID K. WILLIAMS
17. St. Vincent
A new resort may put this Caribbean island on the map.
The fact that American Airlines does not fly there could explain why St. Vincent remains among the Caribbean's best-kept secrets: a stunningly lush, unspoiled gem of an island surrounded by water cerulean enough to render that of other islands murky by comparison. What there is here -- a climbable volcano, dramatic waterfalls, black-sand beaches -- is dwarfed by what there isn't: chain stores, crowds, big hotels.
Except, that is, for one notably new exception. Buccament Bay, a five-star resort, opened in the fall and boasts more rooms, about 360, than all other hotels on the island combined. And there are the resort's five restaurants, a spa, a soccer camp and performing arts center. The resort, along with a new international airport that is scheduled to open in late 2013 and designed to handle five times the number of passengers currently arriving at the island, will most likely let the cat out of the bag and attract the long overdue crowds. Get there before they do. BAZ DREISINGER
18. Moganshan, China
Luxury in the former mountain hideaway of Shanghai gangsters.
Slide Show
For much of the early 20th century, Moganshan, a bamboo-covered mountain about three hours from Shanghai, served as a tranquil retreat for the elite. Wealthy foreigners took up residence on the mountain first, building stone villas and tennis courts. Then came the Chinese power brokers, including the Shanghai mob boss Du Yuesheng and the Kuomintang leader Chiang Kai-shek, who honeymooned here in 1927.
After a lull, the past decade has seen foreigners repopulating Moganshan's sleepy slopes, transforming old villas into homes and guesthouses. And in late 2011, the mountain went upscale with two new luxury properties. The 121-room eco-resort Naked Stables features tree-top villas with Jacuzzis set on balconies overlooking the mountains, and African-inspired "earth huts" built with environmentally friendly rammed-earth walls. Set on a tea plantation, the 40-room Le Passage Moganshan, which partly opened in December, takes its inspiration from Moganshan's historic manor homes, with century-old recycled wood floors and a magnificent garden planted with 12,000 rose bushes. JUSTIN BERGMAN
19. Birmingham, England
Could England's second city be first in food?
Olive, the BBC's food magazine, recently startled British gourmands when it declared Birmingham, England's second largest city, the United Kingdom's "foodiest town," ahead of London and Edinburgh. The award came last October, just as Birmingham was hosting an annual festival, the 10-day Birmingham Food Fest, which featured such local talents as Aktar Islam of Lasan Restaurant; up-and-comers like David Colcombe of Opus, Andy Waters of Edmunds Restaurant and Steve Love of Loves Restaurant; and a troika of Michelin-starred chefs: Glynn Purnell of Purnell's; Andreas Antona, Luke Tipping and Adam Bennett of Simpsons Restaurant; and Richard Turner of Turners of Harborne.
The chefs are building on an already rich dining scene. Birmingham is famous in Britain for its Balti Triangle, an area of town that is home to a beloved Pakistani-Kashmiri curry dish invented here; it is also birthplace to such classically British food items as Typhoo Tea, Bird's Custard and HP Sauce. ALEXANDER LOBRANO
20. Space
The final frontier now has a ticket agent.
It's not just the imaginings of science fiction geeks. Pretty soon anyone with $200,000 will be able to travel to the last frontier: space or -- more specifically -- the upper edge of Earth's atmosphere. In 2004 Richard Branson founded Virgin Galactic with the primary goal of pioneering commercial flights to space. Last year the company began test-flying SpaceShipTwo, an aircraft that will enable two pilots and six passengers to travel to suborbital space. Although no launch date has been confirmed (a 2012 date was pushed back to 2013), about 450 people from around the globe have already purchased tickets; the first passengers will be (surprise!) Richard Branson and his two children, Sam and Holly.
Flights will take off from the brand-new spaceport near Las Cruces, N.M., but Virgin Galactic "Space Agent" Joshua Bush of Park Avenue Travel in Philadelphia, predicts that in a few years "We'll eventually be able to take off from New York, orbit the Earth and then land in Tokyo in two or three hours." What will it be like? "After the rocket motor turns off there is complete silence," said Mr. Bush, who has read about the experiences of many astronauts. "You look out the window and see a thin blue line of the atmosphere and comprehend how small and insignificant we are." GISELA WILLIAMS
21. Kerala, India
A new Indian biennale will make its debut in this coastal state.
Last year India hosted its first pavilion at the Venice Biennale. This year the country inaugurates a biennale of its own. To be held in the southwestern state of Kerala, the Kochi-Muziris Biennale will feature contemporary painting, film, sculpture, installations, new media and performances by Indian and international artists. Most of the action will unfold in the colonial city of Kochi, whose contemporary art scene already offers more than a dozen venues, from the two-year-old David Hall -- a 1695 Dutch colonial mansion -- to the longstanding Kashi Art Cafe, a restaurant-gallery-garden-cafe. To host the events, the city's 19th-century Durbar Hall and other old buildings are getting top-to-bottom face-lifts.
But the most remarkable historical reclamation project is happening in the biennale's other Kerala site, Muziris. A fabled ancient port that traded spices and silk with Egypt and Greece two millennia ago, Muziris mysteriously vanished sometime after the fall of Rome. Archaeologists have recently located and started to excavate the vanished settlement, which opened to tourists this year. The biennale's start date is Dec. 12, 2012, or 12/12/12. SETH SHERWOOD
22. Paraty, Brazil
Putting Brazil's Costa Verde on the cultural map.
Slide Show
This peaceful hideaway is swiftly becoming the most culturally rich destination in Costa Verde, the 325-mile coastline between Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo. Paraty's cultural calendar includes a three-year-old jazz, blues and soul festival organized by Sao Paulo's top live music venue, the Bourbon Street Music Club. Every June, acts like the American trumpeter Roy Hargrove and the Brazilian trombonist Raul de Souza bring their sounds to the historic quarter's cobblestone streets. Another recently inaugurated event is Paraty Em Foco, a yearly series of photography exhibits showcasing up-and-coming artists from Brazil and beyond. And there's Flip, a literary festival packed with readings, caipirinha-fueled parties and erudite stars like Ian McEwan, Isabel Allende and Salman Rushdie.
Paraty's other attractions include boutiques with tasteful handcrafts, cozy cafes, candlelit seafood restaurants and charming inns. The most stylish is Casa Turquesa, voted best new pousada of 2009 by Guia Quatro Rodas (Brazil's version of the Michelin guide). Late this year, Paraty will get its first high-profile luxury hotel. The French brand Maisons des Reves -- known for its chic Relais & Chateaux lodgings -- plans to open a property near the town's sailboat-lined harbor. PAOLA SINGER
23. Koh Rong, Cambodia
A string of islands recalls an undiscovered Asian paradise.
Slide Show
Many adventurous travelers are looking beyond the temples at Angkor to see what else Cambodia has to offer. One possibility is the Koh Rong Archipelago, whose main island is a 30-minute boat ride from the coastal town of Sihanoukville. Until recently there was no place to stay on this string of islands, but that changes with the opening of the Song Saa resort this year.
Rory Hunter, the owner, and his wife, Melita, discovered the untouched archipelago several years after they moved to Cambodia in 2004. Melita, previously an artist specializing in sculptural art installations, designed Song Saa to resemble a Cambodia fishing village -- at least from the outside. Inside guests will find luxurious contemporary comforts like an infinity pool and Wi-Fi complimented by Asian antiques and market finds, like large driftwood columns, old copper bowls, recycled boat timber walls and century-old Cambodian day beds. (For about $600 per person a night.)
Guests will be able to snorkel with sea horses by day and swim in bioluminescent waters at night. And then there's the food. The resort's chef, Neil Wager, imported from the exclusive North Island resort in the Seychelles, will be serving up his own version of local Khmer cuisine starring sustainable local seafood. GISELA WILLIAMS
24. Vienna
Modern art spruces up Austria's imperial capital.
After a flurry of activity, Vienna's venerable museum scene is prepped for a banner year. July marks the 150th birthday of its native son Gustav Klimt, the Vienna Secessionist master whose dreamily erotic gold-leaf paintings have become some of modernism's most popular (and expensive) works; in a range of exhibitions throughout 2012, more of his pieces will be on display in one place than ever before.
And in a city known for its starchy reluctance to change, two pre-eminent institutions have taken on ambitious new directors: Christoph Thun-Hohenstein, the influential former director of the Austrian Cultural Forum in New York, was announced as the new head of the sprawling Museum of Applied Arts, and the Museum of Modern Art reopened in September after extensive renovations and the appointment of a new director, the German curator Karola Kraus.
Last month, another modern art specialist, 20er Haus, reopened as 21er Haus, an exhibition space and cultural center presenting Austrian art from 1945 to the present. And a new high-profile collaboration, to make its debut this spring, will further strengthen the city's art scene: the contemporary art doyenne Francesca von Habsburg will lend both her keen artistic direction and considerable coffers to Augarten Contemporary at the Belvedere museum, set in a Baroque palace complex. The three-year project, called Thyssen-Bornemisza Augarten Contemporary, weds the Belvedere, one of the city's biggest public art institutions, with Ms. von Habsburg's private foundation, Thyssen-Bornemisza Art Contemporary. (For more on Vienna, see the 36 Hours column on page 11.) CHARLY WILDER
25. Chattanooga, Tenn.
A city stages a comeback fueled by artists and retailers.
In 1969, Walter Cronkite famously called Chattanooga the "dirtiest" city in America. In recent years, though, it has undergone a dramatic overhaul with a radical gentrification plan and an aggressive citywide push to lure artists. In addition to a $120 million clean-up-and-invest 21st Century Waterfront Plan, an incentive program called Arts Move brings artists of all mediums into town; a yearly Southern arts fair called Four Bridges draws thousands each April; and several arts districts have been cultivated and nurtured.
On the heels of this artistic transformation has come the inevitable, yet not unwelcome, boutique boom in places like the recently restored Warehouse Row, a Civil War-era factory turned shopping center filled with local, upscale and artisanal goods. SARAH WILDMAN
26. Dakhla, Morocco
In Morocco's south, an arty hideaway.
Slide Show
Morocco's cool crowd doesn't want anyone else to discover this remote but strangely beautiful desert town on the Atlantic Coast of the Western Sahara, an area with a tumultuous history now governed by Morocco. On a 30-mile-long spit of sand between the ocean and a tranquil lagoon about 600 miles south of Marrakesh, the town is becoming one of the world's greatest wind- and kite-board surfing destinations.
But there's more to Dakhla than high-flying fun. Many come for its fledgling bohemian status: it's a wild, remote, sun-drenched place with a freewheeling atmosphere and plenty of local Tuareg culture. Water temperatures remain a constant 80 degrees year-round, the desert is a short trek away, and the locally caught seafood is delicious. Sleepy during the day thanks to the often intense Saharan heat, the town comes alive after dark with lively cafes and restaurants. Dakhla also finally has a place for nonbackpackers: the Calipau Sahara hotel, a modern riad that opened two years ago, with a long stretch of private beach and a seawater pool. And although part of Dakhla's charm is its relative inaccessibility, Royal Air Maroc offers daily flights from Casablanca. ALEXANDER LOBRANO
27. Maldives
A cushy place for hard-core surfers? Here it is.
When one thinks of the Maldives, a necklace of 26 tropical atolls in the Indian Ocean, one might envision $2,000 suites on stilts over turquoise waters and honeymooners dining barefoot on the beach. But world-class surfers? Not so much. Think again. "It's ideal," said Ross Phillips, founder of Tropicsurf, a leading outfitter in the high-end surfing scene. "Good, consistent waves, warm water, a wide choice of five-star resorts and plenty of things to do for the partners who don't surf." This past summer six world champion surfers headed to the Maldives for what was billed as the world's most exclusive surfing event: Four Seasons Maldives Surfing Champions Trophy, which was held at the Four Seasons Kuda Huraa resort.
Early 2012 will see several new splashy resorts, like the Niyama, which has an underwater restaurant, and the Viceroy, 66 villas on the remote private island of Vagaru. GISELA WILLIAMS
28. Malacca, Malaysia
A World Heritage site ramps up its tourism options.
Slide Show
With its lantern-lighted canals and silent, narrow streets lined with decades-old ornate temples and shop houses, few places in Southeast Asia conjure romantic images of the past as effectively as Malacca, Malaysia's oldest city. A former Portuguese, Dutch and British colony, this Unesco World Heritage site is now attracting record numbers of tourists lured by its unusual architecture and cuisine, which reflect centuries of foreign influences.
More than seven million visitors are expected in 2011, so the town, about 90 miles southeast of the capital, Kuala Lumpur, is welcoming new hotels like the Casa del Rio, a Portuguese-inspired luxury boutique property with 66 rooms; and Courtyard@Heeren, a 100-year-old shop house converted into a 14-room hotel. When you're not exploring places like the 17th-century former Dutch town hall or Jonker Street's antiques shops, gorge on Malacca's outstanding local specialties, like creamy, piquant nyonya laksa at the family-run Donald & Lily's. NAOMI LINDT
29. The Algarve
Portugal's Riviera gets a new spate of luxury hotels.
The Algarve, on Portugal's southern coast, has long been a major package-holiday destination for northern Europeans. But the sun-drenched region is aiming to attract a wider crowd as it recycles itself with a crop of new or renovated luxury hotels emphasizing style, authenticity and eco-friendliness. In Portimao, a perfect example is the just reopened 38-room Hotel Bela Vista. This 1918 villa overlooking the famous seaside Praia da Rocha was renovated by the French hotelier Thierry Naidu and features a stunning design by the Portuguese decorator Graca Viterbo.
There are hotels opening in quieter areas of the Algarve, too, including the striking Martinhal resort in Sagres, and a Conrad hotel scheduled to open in November. Trendy Lisboans are also flocking to Olhao, a former fish-canning town turned resort with stylish lodging options, like the recently opened Real Marina Hotel & Spa, and natural attractions, including the Ria Formosa, a national park made up of one of the largest barrier-reef lagoons in Europe, where you might have the pristine beauty of white sand beaches to yourself -- for now, at least. ALEXANDER LOBRANO
30. Tahoe, Calif.
New lifts, lodging, trails and snowcat rides.
Lake Tahoe's seven major ski areas have been undergoing a dizzying slate of improvements that will eventually tally at least $100 million. Most notable is Squaw Valley's November merger with adjacent Alpine Meadows; at 6,000 acres, it now offers the most ski terrain in the United States. Guests can take a free shuttle between base areas and will find, among other upgrades, new ski school services, expanded terrain parks, a kids' snow-play area with mini-snowmobiles, and new restaurants, including Rocker @ Squaw, a burger joint where skiers can upload their own helmet-cam videos to TV.
Improvements at Northstar, recently acquired by Vail Resorts, include a quad chairlift and an on-mountain restaurant with stellar views of the Pacific Crest. Advanced skiers can explore 170 acres of new gladed terrain or hop a snowcat to ski the Sawtooth Ridge. Likewise, Sierra-at-Tahoe introduced snowcat rides to Huckleberry Canyon. Kirkwood renovated its Mountain Club hotel and Heavenly added three trails, a children's ski school center and a kids' trail. CINDY HIRSCHFELD
31. Wales
A new hiking path brings new views of rugged shores.
Wales's many hiking trails are known for their views of rugged highlands and cliff-hemmed coasts. Exploring the country by foot will become easier in May, when the Wales Coast Path is completed, connecting several disparate paths and creating a 1,030-mile pedestrian route that rings the country. The Wales Coast Path -- which in stretches will be open to cyclists and horseback riders -- follows the Atlantic and the Irish Sea over the length of the country, passing medieval castles and threading through cities including Cardiff and seaside resort towns like Tenby.
While few will have the legs to tackle the entire trail, outfitters including Celtic Trails and Contours Walking Holidays lighten the load by offering inn-to-inn luggage shuttles over several portions of the long distance path. ELAINE GLUSAC
32. Antarctica
Still remote and exotic. Now luxurious too.
A hundred years ago the race to the South Pole held the world in thrall -- poor Robert Falcon Scott lost the title as the first man there, by a month, to the Norwegian Roald Amundsen, and died on his way back through the unforgiving landscape.
The 100-year anniversary of the arrival of these rugged explorers is a reminder of our continued fascination with a region that remains in many ways as remote, exotic and evocative as it ever was. White Desert is marking the event with a new camp that allows travelers to spend the night in accommodations that Amundsen and Scott could only have dreamed of: fiberglass pods with en-suite bathrooms, dressing rooms and comfy beds. During the day, groups (limited to 12 ) pass the time ice climbing, abseiling through open crevasses, kite skiing and visiting colonies of Emperor penguins.
Another way to see the icy scapes is by ship: Abercrombie & Kent's Le Boreal, for example, can navigate some of the smaller fjords and has onboard experts who lecture on everything from wildlife to the history of the region.
Luckily though, the number of overall visitors will remain restricted, guaranteeing, it is hoped, at least another 100 years of relative isolation and pristine wilderness. ONDINE COHANE
33. Uganda
Stability and sustainable tourism restore luster to Africa's pearl.
Marred by the murderous regime of Idi Amin in the 1970s, Uganda remained largely off the typical African safari tour map. But after more than two decades of relative stability under President Yoweri Museveni, the country that Winston Churchill called the "pearl of Africa" is regaining some of its allure for tourists.
While Uganda has not been without problems, including twin bombings in Kampala during the 2010 World Cup, some street clashes during political protests last year and a history of extreme antagonism toward gay people, it's still considered one of the more stable countries in sub-Saharan Africa.
The country is perhaps best known to tourists as the home of half of the world's last remaining mountain gorillas, and this year there are more opportunities to spot the elusive creatures. The Uganda Wildlife Authority recently added two gorilla families to the groups it tracks on tours in Bwindi Impenetrable Forest, a Unesco World Heritage site in southwest Uganda. Sanctuary Gorilla Forest Camp, a luxury tented camp inside the forest, is working with the Batwa Pygmy tribe, indigenous hunter-gatherers who were relocated when the park was established, to share their history and culture with guests. And Country Walkers , based in Waterbury, Vt., is offering its first safari ever in Uganda.
Beyond up-close gorilla encounters, Uganda is also the source of the Nile, boasts mountains that are among the highest in Africa -- the Mountains of the Moon in Rwenzori Mountains National Park -- and offers formidable white-water rapids for thrill seekers. MICHELLE HIGGINS
34. Ukraine
Virginal beaches and czarist palaces -- at Old World prices.
Ukraine has finally seen an influx of much-needed cash to fund its long underdeveloped tourism sector, in part thanks to its selection as a co-host of the 2012 Union of European Football Associations European Championship. Beautiful, historic cities like Kiev, Odessa and Lviv have seen modernization, restoration and fresh cultural energy, but are still cheap, laid-back and largely free of tourist traps. All three cities have revamped their airports and added numerous hotels, restaurants and retail outlets, while new roadwork makes travel outside the city centers easier and more comfortable.
Beach lovers are well advised to head to the Black Sea coast, which extends along the Crimean Peninsula to Odessa. Long a popular beach destination for Russians, the area has slowly begun attracting a wider audience with its pristine beaches, mild climate, jutting cliffs and architectural marvels. CHARLY WILDER
35. Samana Peninsula, Dominican Republic
Unspoiled beaches, but not for long.
For years, the Samana Peninsula on the northeast coast of the Dominican Republic was one of the Caribbean's remaining natural holdouts, largely untouched because of its remote location. But an international airport, El Catey, built near the peninsula's base a few years ago and, more recently, a highway that shortened the drive from Santo Domingo to two hours from five, are bringing new development.
Balcones del Atlaantico, a RockResort that opened last May in the village of Las Terrenas, is the newest luxury resort on the peninsula. Its 86 two- and three-bedroom villas start at $500 a night, supplying a cushy base from which to explore ecotourism. The Peninsula House, a plantation-style estate with just six suites from $580 a night, was named a 2011 Grand Award winner by Andrew Harper's Hideaway Report. And Auberge Resort's' Casa Tropicalia , with 44 beachfront suites and an open-air spa on Samana Bay, is to open in 2014.
There are plenty of off-resort attractions, too. Just last month, Bavaro Runners, an adventure tour operator, opened a new zip-line tour consisting of 20 platforms and 10 zip-lines.
Go now, before the crowds arrive. MICHELLE HIGGINS
36. Dubrovnik, Croatia
The St.-Tropez of the Balkans, equal parts classic and modern.
The last five years have been good to Dubrovnik: as it has opened to Western tourists, its number of visitors has climbed steadily -- around 10 percent a year -- since the global recession hit in 2008. Often called the Jewel of the Adriatic, this seaside city features marble streets, Renaissance fountains and white sand beaches. It has also recently completed an expansion of its airport and a sleek renovation of its cable car system, offering improved city access and views.
Meanwhile, local hoteliers compete to capture the growing stream of high-end tourists, with the 17th-century Pucic Palace , the upscale Excelsior Hotel & Spa and the gorgeous clifftop Villa Dubrovnik all seeing extensive renovations in the last few years. Newer culinary draws include the French-fusion spot Gil's, the two-year-old Panorama and Lucin Kantun, a Croatian tapas restaurant that opened last year in the Old Town. CHARLY WILDER
37. Chiloe Island, Chile
A new look, and controversy, on the edge of South America.
Slide Show
Just off the west coast of Chile, where the land starts to look as if it had been broken apart by a jackhammer, Chiloe Island -- known for its stilt houses, Unesco-anointed churches , nature preserves, unusual wildlife and raw natural beauty -- is getting a facelift. Until recently, the 3,200-square-mile island was mainly a respite for locals. But President Sebastian Pinera has plans to share the island with the rest of the world.
The Chilean government has started pouring billions of pesos into the island's infrastructure and the results are already evident: new paved roads, a new ferry terminal and the soon-to-open Mocopulli Airport in the town of Castro, which will offer direct flights to Santiago. The Chilean power company Ecopower has plans to build a 56-turbine wind farm, which is expected to produce three times the island's power needs. Once construction begins, however, the island could lose many of its migratory birds, penguins and endangered blue whales, environmental groups have cautioned. In other words, the time to go is now.

38. Jordan
New flights and a new modernist airport ease the way for visitors.
It might seem foolhardy for an airline to add a Middle East destination just as much of the Arab world is in political turmoil. But the airline is easyJet, known for its forays into unexpected markets, and the country is Jordan, which has mostly been spared the kind of protests that have toppled leaders elsewhere.
Why get on board? Starting this summer, travelers will be able to disembark at the new state-of-the-art terminal of Queen Alia airport. Designed by Sir Norman Foster using desert and Middle Eastern motifs, the building is a fitting welcome to a country that is trying to modernize while maintaining its natural beauty and traditions.
From there, head to the infinity pool of the new DoubleTree by Hilton hotel in the Red Sea resort of Aqaba. It's a soothing way to wind down after a camel expedition through the Mars-like landscape of nearby Wadi Rum, a 285-square-mile expanse of desert punctuated by wind-eroded rock formations. The region -- "vast, echoing and God-like," in the words of Lawrence of Arabia -- was named a Unesco World Heritage site last year. SETH SHERWOOD
39. Crans-Montana, Switzerland
Restaurants and luxury chalets shine a light on an Alpine resort.
Surprisingly few international tourists visit Crans-Montana, favoring better-known Alpine resorts like Zermatt and Verbier to see and be seen. But with its upmarket designer shops, five-star hotels, Michelin-starred dining and 87 miles of downhill slopes, the word is getting out.
Perched high above the Rhone Valley in western Switzerland on a sunny, south-facing plateau, the two-town resort offers panoramic views of the Matterhorn and Mont Blanc. With more than 250 boutiques, 60 restaurants and 30 hotels, Crans-Montana isn't lacking for apres-ski activities. And new flights from the charter airline Snowjet from London Stansted to Sion airport, about 19 miles from the resort, are making it easier to be on the slopes within an hour of stepping off the plane.
Abercrombie & Kent Villas, a division of the luxury tour company, has taken notice, adding the destination to its collection of luxury ski chalets this season. Weekly rental rates at one of its five 2,700-square-foot chalets, each featuring a Jacuzzi and wine cellar, start at 3,936 euros (about $5,085) for a four-bedroom.
The mountain resort is also celebrated for being the host of the Omega European Masters, among Europe's largest golf events, every September at one of the highest 18-hole golf courses in the Alps, the Severiano Ballesteros. Last year, the Crans-sur-Sierre Golf Club opened the first year-round high-altitude European golf training center so avid duffers can practice their swing despite the snow. MICHELLE HIGGINS
40. Montpellier, France
France's eighth-largest city is dressing up in designer style.
The most celebrated architect in France, Jean Nouvel, and a collaborator, Francois Fontes, introduced their blue and cube-like city hall in November, and early next year Mr. Nouvel's RBC Design Center -- another coolly modernist structure that will house the RBC brand's furniture showroom -- is to open its doors in this medieval, student-filled Mediterranean city.
Even more innovative, the long-awaited Pierres Vives Building from the star architect Zaha Hadid will be ready by year's end. A long, sprawling edifice of swirly white concrete layers and green-tinted glass, the futuristic structure will hold a library, archives and municipal offices.
And to reach them, the city is installing what may be Europe's sexiest tram system. The two existing lines sport exteriors of kaleidoscopic birds and flowers by Christian Lacroix, and two new lines with Mr. Lacroix's trademark color-soaked style are on their way. Both will make their debut this spring with an underwater design theme and a solar theme, respectively, along roughly 17 miles of new track. Think of it as France's longest fashion runway. SETH SHERWOOD
41. Nosara, Costa Rica
Surfing geeks have descended on a remote little town.
With sandy beaches, warm, jade-green waters and rolling waves that rarely get too big, the remote jungle community of Nosara on the Pacific Coast of Costa Rica has become the ideal spot to learn to surf. The crescent-shaped Guiones beach is a good jumping-off point to go hiking or visit the nearby turtle refuge, and there are small, charming hotels and local bars with live music. But in a place that sees sunny, rainless weather from December to May, surfing's the thing.
Surf schools have popped up all over town, including Surf Simply, which focuses on a technical, sports-coach philosophy and has a new guided trip option along the coast for its 2012 surf programs, and Safari Surf School , an official Billabong-certified surf camp. Nosara Surf Cam offers a real-time Web feed of the waves. Take a look and get your stoke on. BONNIE TSUI
42. South Korea
Is golf's newest hot spot in Asia?
South Korea is redefining just how luxurious golf resorts can be. A slew of new private clubs -- the kind with six-digit membership fees, designs by celebrity architects and clubhouses that look like modern art museums -- have opened recently in the country.
The most prestigious is Haesley Nine Bridges, just outside Seoul, with a clubhouse covered by a huge, sinuous web of wooden beams (it also features one of Jeff Koons's giant balloon toy sculptures).
Then there's the Ananti Club, also a commuter's distance from Seoul: 486 acres containing three courses nestled in the Yumyeongsan forest, with a clubhouse, designed by the architect Ken Min, built almost entirely underground. And the futuristic Jack Nicklaus Golf Club Korea, which opened last year in the financial center of Songdo, has a huge, undulating clubhouse designed by the California architect Mehrdad Yazdani.
In 2015, South Korea will be the host of the Presidents Cup for the first time; apparently there are some tournament-worthy courses to go with all those fancy new clubhouses. DANIELLE PERGAMENT
43. Lodz, Poland
The Hollywood of Poland reclaims its industrial past.
Poland's third-largest city and the movie-making headquarters of the country (with a film school that started the careers of Roman Polanski and Andrzej Wajda), Lodz has seen its labyrinth of textile warehouses and industrial-era relics repurposed for artistic and entrepreneurial ventures.
The latest is by the director David Lynch, who has a deal to establish a major film studio in a former 19th-century power plant in the city. Its makeover -- which will also include a planetarium, a library, an exhibition space and a theater -- is scheduled to be shown to the public in 2014. Additionally, the architect Frank Gehry, whose grandparents were from Lodz, is in talks to design a festival and congress center with an avant-garde, building-block shape.
These ventures will be in good company. One Lodz weaving mill is now a retail and entertainment center called Manufaktura, while another, Ms2, is a three-year-old contemporary art museum filled with experimental leanings. A 19th-century industrial complex has been reborn as an art incubator, Lodz Art Center, that is the host of lectures and festivals. RACHEL B. DOYLE
44. Dalarna, Sweden
A storied region offers a getaway from Stockholm.
Most travelers know Sweden only for the urban cool of Stockholm and Gothenburg. But when the sun approaches its summer apex, city dwellers often leave town for one of the country's central provinces, Dalarna. Its deep forests and glimmering lakes host traditional midsummer parties, and every brick-red farmhouse deserves its own postcard. With Dalarna's southern edge only about 125 miles from the capital, getting there -- by car, bus or rail -- is easy enough, though the rustic landscape of "the Dales," as Dalarna translates, can feel worlds apart.
That's made it a natural respite for Swedish painters like Anders Zorn, whose home in the town of Mora is now a museum. Artisans still produce traditional handicrafts like the Dala Horse, a national mascot. But Dalarna is not just for summer journeys: every March, the region hosts the Vasaloppet, one of the world's biggest cross-country ski races, and autumn brings incredible foliage and rich game dishes at restaurants of surprising sophistication like the Dala-Husby Hotell. EVAN RAIL
45. Portovenere, Italy
Stepping in while the Cinque Terre rebuilds.
Slide Show
In late October, torrential rain caused catastrophic mudslides and flooding that devastated Monterosso and Vernazza, two of the cliff-clinging, seaside villages in the famed Cinque Terre on Italy's northwestern coast.
Though the towns are slowly being rebuilt, travelers seeking the pleasures of the area in 2012 should instead consider Portovenere, an equally charming, though largely overlooked, town just south of the Cinque Terre.
Like its more famous neighbors, Portovenere is a traditional fishing village with a picturesque jumble of pastel houses, boats bobbing in the harbor and a network of meandering hiking trails. But here, crowds are sparse, so poke around the 13th-century, black-and-white striated church in peace, before marveling at the views across the glittering Bay of La Spezia, which has long inspired poets and writers, from Lord Byron to D.H. Lawrence. INGRID K. WILLIAMS
Correction: January 22, 2012, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The cover article on Jan. 8 about 45 places to go in 2012 contained errors in the entries for 4, 20, 34 and 37, about London, space, Ukraine and Chiloe Island, Chile.
The Charles Dickens Museum in London is now open; it is not reopening in time for the author's 200th birthday, Feb. 7. Because of an editing error, both the Waldorf-Astoria hotel and Heathrow Airport were described as being east of London; they are west of the city.
The location of the spaceport from which Virgin Galactic flights into space will depart is about 55 miles north of Las Cruces, N.M.; it is not in Las Cruces.
Ukraine is a co-host of the Union of European Football Associations Championship, not the host.
And a wind turbine project in Chiloe Island, Chile, is expected to produce three times the island's power needs; it will not triple the island's power needs.

Abstract: Since November 2010, when Myanmar's rulers held nominally free elections and released Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi after 15 years of house arrest, the boycott has been lifted and Myanmar is set for an influx of visitors. Because the country has been so isolated, the deeply Buddhist "Land of the Golden Pagoda" resonates with a strong sense of place, undiluted by mass tourism and warmed by genuine hospitality.

Full text: CORRECTION APPENDED
1. Panama
Go for the canal. Stay for everything else.
It's been 12 years since Panama regained control of its canal, and the country's economy is booming. Cranes stalk the skyline of the capital, Panama City, where high-rises sprout one after the next and immigrants arrive daily from around the world. Among those who have landed en masse in recent years are American expatriates and investors, who have banked on Panamanian real estate by building hotels and buying retirement homes. The passage of the United States-Panama free trade agreement in October is expected to accelerate this international exchange of people and dollars (the countries use the same currency).
Among the notable development projects is the Panama Canal itself, which is in the early stages of a multibillion-dollar expansion. The project will widen and deepen the existing canal and add two locks, doubling the canal's cargo capacity. For those who want to see the waterway as it was originally designed, now is the time. The expansion is expected to be completed by 2014, the canal's 100-year anniversary.
Other high-profile projects include the construction of three firsts: The Panamera, the first Waldorf Astoria hotel in Latin America (set to open in June 2012); the Trump Ocean Club, the region's tallest building, which opened last summer; and Frank Gehry's first Latin American design, the BioMuseo, a natural history museum scheduled to open in early 2013. Even Panama City's famously dilapidated historic quarter, Casco Viejo, has been transformed. The neighborhood, a tangle of narrow streets, centuries-old houses and neo-colonial government buildings, was designated a Unesco World Heritage site in 1997 and is now a trendy arts district with galleries, coffeehouses, street musicians and some of the city's most stylish restaurants and boutique hotels.
Across the isthmus, on Panama's Caribbean coast, the Bocas del Toro archipelago has become a popular stop on the backpacker circuit, with snorkeling and zip lining by day and raucous night life after dark. FREDA MOON
2. Helsinki, Finland
Design. Design. Design. Aesthetics fuel a new cool.
Copenhagen's culinary awakening and Stockholm's trend-setting fashion may have ignited the world's current infatuation with Nordic culture; now Helsinki is poised for the spotlight. The International Council of Societies of Industrial Design has designated it the World Design Capital for 2012.
Design has long been part of the city's DNA, but in recent years the scene has been increasingly energized: the official Design District has ballooned to encompass 25 streets and nearly 200 design-minded businesses, which range from shops selling housewares and furniture to boutique hotels and clothing stores. Design has infiltrated the restaurant scene as well, notably the elegant Chez Dominique and the hot newcomer (and Michelin-starred) Olo.
On top of all that is the spectacular new $242 million Helsinki Music Center. Student ensembles from the Sibelius Academy -- the sole university in Finland devoted exclusively to music -- will perform in the striking glass-walled space, and both the Vienna Philharmonic and the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestras will give concerts in 2012. INGRID K. WILLIAMS
3. Myanmar
Back on the tourist map after being off-limits for years.
With renowned cultural treasures, world-class boutique hotels and deserted beaches, Myanmar has long been high on intrepid travelers' wish lists. For years, though, heeding calls by the pro-democracy leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and others, many stayed away in protest of Myanmar's authoritarian regime.
Now, however, this is changing.
Since November 2010, when Myanmar's rulers held nominally free elections and released Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi after 15 years of house arrest, the boycott has been lifted and Myanmar is set for an influx of visitors.
Because the country has been so isolated, the deeply Buddhist "Land of the Golden Pagoda" resonates with a strong sense of place, undiluted by mass tourism and warmed by genuine hospitality. Travelers will find atmospheric hotels and a network of well-maintained regional jets serving the main sites. (Keep in mind that visas are still required and that the economy remains largely cash-based.)
But locals are aware of the potential downside of tourism as well. Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi has called for sustainable development and "trickle down" tourism where dollars will do the most good.
With these goals in mind, nestled along the banks of meandering Lake Inle in eastern Myanmar, the ViewPoint eco-lodge combines locally sourced materials with individually tailored activities supporting the local economy (like garden-to-table lunches at an island village house).
Similarly, in Ngapali Beach -- a pristine swath of coastline on the Bay of Bengal -- the Amara Ocean Resort ratchets up the om factor with a hand-built spa. The resort finances relief projects in the Irrawaddy River delta. CEIL MILLER-BOUCHET
4. London
The Olympics! The Queen! Charles Dickens turns 200!
Dotted with construction sites, London is preparing for the pomp and circumstance of the Olympic Games and the Diamond Jubilee celebration of the Queen's 60th year on the throne. New stadiums, public spaces and shopping centers are emerging on the city's eastern edge, and on the western edge a 137-room Waldorf Astoria has opened on a 400-acre estate near Heathrow Airport.
But it's not all sport and royalty. On a street of chocolate-box Georgian houses in Bloomsbury, the Charles Dickens Museum is open, in time for the author's 200th birthday. Across town, Warner Brothers Studio Tour will open the Harry Potter studios to those keen to re-live the films. The Rolling Stones, celebrating their 50th anniversary, might tour again, with a possible finale here. And Robert Redford will inaugurate a London outpost of the Sundance Film festival at the O2 Arena in April.
Amid the hubbub, flashes of eccentricity emerge. If the Waldorf doesn't appeal, stay in an architect-designed boat, perched on the edge of a roof overlooking the Thames. Or visit the British outpost of Occupy London, which will be maintaining its tent city outside St. Paul's cathedral. RAVI SOMAIYA
5. Oakland, Calif.
New restaurants and bars beckon amid the grit.
Tensions have cooled since violence erupted at the recent Occupy Oakland protests, but the city's revitalized night-life scene has continued to smolder.
The historic Fox Theater reopened in 2009 and quickly cemented its status as one of the Bay Area's top music venues, drawing acts like Wilco and the Decemberists. Meanwhile, the city's ever more sophisticated restaurants are now being joined by upscale cocktail bars, turning once-gritty Oakland into an increasingly appealing place to be after dark. James Syhabout, the chef who earned Oakland its first (and only) Michelin star two years ago at Commis, followed up in May with the instant-hit Hawker Fare, a casual spot serving Asian street food. Big-name San Francisco chefs are now joining him. Daniel Patterson (of two-Michelin-star Coi) opened the restaurant Plum in late 2010 and an adjacent cocktail bar later, and another restaurant, called Haven, in the recently renovated Jack London Square last month. INGRID K. WILLIAMS
6. Tokyo
With some tourists slow to return, greater opportunities for those who do.
The thought of traveling to Tokyo will most likely make some people nervous. Though the city is about 180 miles from the Fukushima Daiichi power plant, the site of the worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl -- and the State Department recommends travelers avoid only the area directly around the disaster site -- Tokyo has suffered as well, a problem of perception as much as reality.
But from another vantage point, it's a perfect time to visit. A decrease in tourism and business travel is making the city all the more accessible and welcoming. According to Laurent Vernhes, a founder and the chief executive of TabletHotels.com, a travel site with a curated list of distinctive lodging options, tourism hasn't yet returned to normal levels. "Rates are still down about 10 percent on average compared to the same time last year," Mr. Vernhes said.
When I visited the city in the fall, it was clear that it is still crackling with energy. But now it's possible to get a previously unthinkable last-minute reservation at one of the city's many world-class restaurants or a room in hotels usually booked solid. A Saturday night dinner at Kagurazaka Ishikawa, a pricey but discreet restaurant with three Michelin stars and an artful tasting menu? No problem. And lodging options for all budgets have gotten easier. Chances are you can find a room at the elegant Park Hyatt Tokyo, a luxurious high-rise, or at the Tokyo Ryokan, a family-run hotel with just three simple bedrooms that often are reserved well in advance. OLIVER STRAND
Note: An earlier version of the subheading with this entry has been changed because it was unintentionally insensitive in making a link between last year's tragedy in Japan and the opportunity for tourism.
7. Tanzania
Coming into its own as an upscale safari destination.
For the last several years the number of tourists going to Tanzania has been edging up, according to East African travel specialists like Hippo Creek Safaris and Abercrombie & Kent. But it wasn't until several violent attacks on visitors to neighboring Kenya that the numbers really took off, as Tanzania started to absorb skittish Kenya-bound safari seekers.
Not that Tanzania is coasting along solely on Kenya's troubles; it's always had Mount Kilimanjaro, after all. And now other attractions are being discovered, too -- places like Gibb's Farm, a small lodge from which guests can hike to the Ngorongoro Crater area, a prime destination for big game viewing. In addition, the opening of exclusive safari reserves like the Singita Grumeti and the upscale camps managed by Nomad Tanzania and Chem Chem are evidence that the country's tourist infrastructure is becoming more sophisticated, perhaps even catching up to Kenya's. GISELA WILLIAMS
8. Chilean Patagonia
Proof that adventure doesn't have to mean roughing it.
With its mix of snowy peaks, pristine rain forest and network of virgin national parks, Chile is emerging as one of the world's adventure hot spots and now has a spate of rugged luxury lodges in which adventure-seekers can stay.
Puma Lodge, a glass-and-wood design showcase about an hour and a half south of Santiago, features heli-skiing through miles of untouched powder, and outside of Patagonia's Torres del Paine Park, the brand-new Tierra Patagonia offers activities like horseback riding over the steppes and boat outings on a glacial lake (while also offering creature comforts like a spa and a heated indoor pool). Meanwhile, the latest Singular property, which also opened in November outside the park, leads expeditions into the nearby glaciers. For custom trips, pioneers to the region like Cazenove & Loyd can help navigate the logistical challenges of criss-crossing Chile's dramatic landscapes. ONDINE COHANE
9. Lhasa, Tibet
New luxury hotels bring respite -- and controversy.
Tibet's holy capital is in the throes of a luxury-hotel boom. In Lhasa, this is news: not only is operating an upscale hotel at nearly 12,000 feet above sea level no small feat, but real-estate developments here are, almost by default, also culturally loaded.
The majestic, 162-room St. Regis Lhasa Resort has been in full operation since May. In 2010, a charming Tibetan-owned villa called the Lingtsang reopened as a boutique hotel with opulent, colorful woodwork and courtyard verandas. And coming soon are the sprawling InterContinental Resort Lhasa Paradise and the 284-room Shangri-La, both scheduled to open in 2013.
On the upside, it's the first time that travelers can get high-end amenities in a city where even basic hospitality has been a challenge. On the downside, the openings -- like Lhasa's booming population, new business districts and shopping malls -- are seen by many Tibetans and interested outsiders as more cultural colonization and exploitation of a sacred land.

10. Havana, Cuba
The Cuban capital is once again within Americans' reach.
The only thing that lies between Americans and the sultry streets of Havana these days is the Florida Straits, since the Obama administration has widened the kind of travel allowed. A growing list of organizations have licenses to operate trips to Cuba, including National Geographic Expeditions, Austin-Lehman and the Center for Cuban Studies. There are also more flights from more American cities: Fort Lauderdale and Tampa recently joined New York, Miami and Los Angeles on the list, and Chicago will be added this year.
The "people-to-people" rules require Americans to interact with Cubans (sun-and-sand vacations are still prohibited) so tours involve meeting with art historians, organic farmers and others. Conveniently, new restaurants and bed-and-breakfasts, some in gorgeous colonial villas, have sprung up over the past year as the government has allowed more private enterprise. Havana is also gearing up for its 11th Biennial, from May 11 to June 11, which will draw more than 100 Cuban and international artists. VICTORIA BURNETT
11. Moscow
New cultural venues add a dash of the sacred and profane.
The extravagantly renovated Bolshoi Theater has been preening like a prima donna before the news media's flashbulbs since it reopened in October. And given the $760 million face-lift to the 236-year-old grand dame you can almost hear the czars applauding from their tombs.
But beyond the spotlight, two compelling museums have also made their debuts. The Russian Icon Museum is said to hold the largest private collection of Russian and Eastern Christian religious artwork (some 4,000 pieces). Admission to the museum is free.
You won't find many virgins or saints at Tochka G, whose name translates as "G Spot." With more than 3,000 sex-related items, the bounty includes everything from Soviet-era condoms to high-tech sex dolls to "Wrestling," a 2011 painting by the Russian artist Vera Donskaya-Khilko that depicts a buff Vladimir Putin and Barack Obama challenging each other with their cartoonishly oversized phalluses. In Russia, size does matter. SETH SHERWOOD
12. Glasgow
Zaha Hadid takes on a Scottish waterfront.
Scotland's second city now has a $115 million museum designed by Zaha Hadid to go with its shiny new harbor and river promenade.
The Riverside Museum, which opened in June, is housed in a stunning building on the waterfront, with a 3,000-piece collection devoted to Glasgow's rich shipbuilding and engineering past. Its location, along the River Clyde, was once home to many shipyards, and considered the economic heart of Glasgow. But when the industry left, the area stagnated.
Not anymore. Glasgow has spent more than a decade redeveloping 130 acres of derelict shipyard and unused dockland in an effort to restore the waterway to its former glory. Now there's a pleasant riverside walkway with steel street furniture, cobblestones from Victorian Glasgow and maritime paraphernalia. Lime trees are planted on both sides of the esplanade, and there are bicycle paths throughout. A new ferry stop for the Riverside Museum, which just saw its one-millionth visitor, marks the first time in around 50 years that this section of the river has had regular passenger service.

13. Puebla, Mexico
International mole festival. Need we say more?
May 5, 2012, is the 150-year anniversary of Cinco de Mayo, the date when, in 1862, an outmanned Mexican army defeated the French troops of Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte. The occasion will be marked with a fiesta in Puebla, the chief spot in Mexico that celebrates the holiday. Ahead of the May festival, the city, the affluent capital of one of Mexico's safest states, is building a light rail line similar to the one in Mexico City and renovating public spaces. Privately, Museo Amparo, which holds one of the country's most impressive collections of indigenous and colonial-era artifacts, has undergone a $17 million update and expansion.
But the city's biggest draw might be its famous mole poblano. The city is inaugurating an international mole festival which will begin on May 2. Hopes are that it will attract celebrity chefs like Rick Bayless, who recently took staff members to Puebla's Mural de los Poblanos restaurant for their annual employee trip. FREDA MOON
14. San Diego
With breweries and brewpubs, a sunny heaven for suds lovers.
Slide Show
Even in times of tight budgets, finely crafted beer remains a relatively approachable luxury, and few American regions have more brewing momentum than San Diego County. Maybe it's time, then, to think about building a beer safari in the land of sunshine, fish tacos and hopped-up American IPAs. Long established craft breweries like Karl Strauss Brewing Company and the cheeky Stone Brewing Company have mentored brewmasters and created demand for some seriously offbeat ales.
The area has long been a hotbed of garage-based hobbyists, so it's no surprise that the region also has a tradition of dedicated home brewing. The result is a cluster of small breweries, like the tiny but soon-to-expand Hess Brewing.
And there are numerous opportunities for rigorous but never dour beer tastings, at staggeringly comprehensive shops like Bottlecraft Beer Shop & Tasting Room and Pizza Port Bottle Shop, as well as beer-obsessed taverns like Hamilton's and O'Brien's and restaurants like Local Habit. Those looking for full immersion can pack a stein for the fourth annual San Diego Beer Week in November. SARA DICKERMAN
15. Halong Bay, Vietnam
New ways to visit a natural wonder in Southeast Asia.
Slide Show
Though Halong Bay, a staggering seascape of some 1,600 limestone islands and islets in the Gulf of Tonkin, formed over millions of years, there's never been a better time to visit. In November, the Unesco World Heritage site was provisionally named one of the world's "new seven wonders of nature" based on a global poll conducted by the Swiss foundation New7Wonders -- just as Vietnam Airlines announced the first-ever nonstop flights between London and Vietnam. Largely untouched by humans and topped with thick jungle flora, the rock formations rise dramatically in conical peaks and pillars from the surrounding waters, which feature offshore coral reefs, freshwater swamps, mangrove forests and sandy beaches. Visitors can now reach what Ho Chi Minh himself called "the wonder one cannot impart to others," on local junk boats, luxury cruises or a spate of new adventure tours offered by companies like InterAsia, World Expeditions and the Luxury Travel Group.

16. Florence, Italy
A Renaissance city gets a contemporary kick.
Since 2009, Florence's youthful mayor, Matteo Renzi, has championed efforts to build a livable, living city that celebrates -- but is not yoked to -- its rich history (and historic riches). The result? An energized arts scene unfolding inside various medieval palazzi, ancient landmarks restored and reopened to the public for the first time in decades and restaurants abandoning traditional Tuscan staples for sophisticated contemporary food.
The grand 15th-century Palazzo Strozzi is now home to the Center for Contemporary Culture Strozzina and a destination for must-see events like the coming "Americans in Florence: Sargent and the American Impressionists," which opens in March. Spazi Urbani Contemporanei, an arts space occupying a 15th-century former monastery, now features works from emerging Italian artists. Last year, the 148- foot-tall 14th-century San Niccolo tower reopened to the public with one of the best panoramic views of the city. And in September, the flagship Gucci Museum made its debut in the historic Palazzo della Mercanzia.
The city's stock of refined hotel offerings has also been elevated by the opulent new St. Regis Florence, which opened in a palatial riverside palazzo in May, and the Grand Hotel Villa Cora, another five-star stunner near the Boboli Gardens. Even the once-staid Florentine dining scene has been reborn with new restaurants like IO Osteria Personale and Ossi di Seppia.
Next for the Tuscan capital are plans to restore the banks of the Arno River and spruce up the city's largest park. INGRID K. WILLIAMS
17. St. Vincent
A new resort may put this Caribbean island on the map.
The fact that American Airlines does not fly there could explain why St. Vincent remains among the Caribbean's best-kept secrets: a stunningly lush, unspoiled gem of an island surrounded by water cerulean enough to render that of other islands murky by comparison. What there is here -- a climbable volcano, dramatic waterfalls, black-sand beaches -- is dwarfed by what there isn't: chain stores, crowds, big hotels.
Except, that is, for one notably new exception. Buccament Bay, a five-star resort, opened in the fall and boasts more rooms, about 360, than all other hotels on the island combined. And there are the resort's five restaurants, a spa, a soccer camp and performing arts center. The resort, along with a new international airport that is scheduled to open in late 2013 and designed to handle five times the number of passengers currently arriving at the island, will most likely let the cat out of the bag and attract the long overdue crowds. Get there before they do. BAZ DREISINGER
18. Moganshan, China
Luxury in the former mountain hideaway of Shanghai gangsters.
Slide Show
For much of the early 20th century, Moganshan, a bamboo-covered mountain about three hours from Shanghai, served as a tranquil retreat for the elite. Wealthy foreigners took up residence on the mountain first, building stone villas and tennis courts. Then came the Chinese power brokers, including the Shanghai mob boss Du Yuesheng and the Kuomintang leader Chiang Kai-shek, who honeymooned here in 1927.
After a lull, the past decade has seen foreigners repopulating Moganshan's sleepy slopes, transforming old villas into homes and guesthouses. And in late 2011, the mountain went upscale with two new luxury properties. The 121-room eco-resort Naked Stables features tree-top villas with Jacuzzis set on balconies overlooking the mountains, and African-inspired "earth huts" built with environmentally friendly rammed-earth walls. Set on a tea plantation, the 40-room Le Passage Moganshan, which partly opened in December, takes its inspiration from Moganshan's historic manor homes, with century-old recycled wood floors and a magnificent garden planted with 12,000 rose bushes. JUSTIN BERGMAN
19. Birmingham, England
Could England's second city be first in food?
Olive, the BBC's food magazine, recently startled British gourmands when it declared Birmingham, England's second largest city, the United Kingdom's "foodiest town," ahead of London and Edinburgh. The award came last October, just as Birmingham was hosting an annual festival, the 10-day Birmingham Food Fest, which featured such local talents as Aktar Islam of Lasan Restaurant; up-and-comers like David Colcombe of Opus, Andy Waters of Edmunds Restaurant and Steve Love of Loves Restaurant; and a troika of Michelin-starred chefs: Glynn Purnell of Purnell's; Andreas Antona, Luke Tipping and Adam Bennett of Simpsons Restaurant; and Richard Turner of Turners of Harborne.
The chefs are building on an already rich dining scene. Birmingham is famous in Britain for its Balti Triangle, an area of town that is home to a beloved Pakistani-Kashmiri curry dish invented here; it is also birthplace to such classically British food items as Typhoo Tea, Bird's Custard and HP Sauce. ALEXANDER LOBRANO
20. Space
The final frontier now has a ticket agent.
It's not just the imaginings of science fiction geeks. Pretty soon anyone with $200,000 will be able to travel to the last frontier: space or -- more specifically -- the upper edge of Earth's atmosphere. In 2004 Richard Branson founded Virgin Galactic with the primary goal of pioneering commercial flights to space. Last year the company began test-flying SpaceShipTwo, an aircraft that will enable two pilots and six passengers to travel to suborbital space. Although no launch date has been confirmed (a 2012 date was pushed back to 2013), about 450 people from around the globe have already purchased tickets; the first passengers will be (surprise!) Richard Branson and his two children, Sam and Holly.
Flights will take off from the brand-new spaceport near Las Cruces, N.M., but Virgin Galactic "Space Agent" Joshua Bush of Park Avenue Travel in Philadelphia, predicts that in a few years "We'll eventually be able to take off from New York, orbit the Earth and then land in Tokyo in two or three hours." What will it be like? "After the rocket motor turns off there is complete silence," said Mr. Bush, who has read about the experiences of many astronauts. "You look out the window and see a thin blue line of the atmosphere and comprehend how small and insignificant we are." GISELA WILLIAMS
21. Kerala, India
A new Indian biennale will make its debut in this coastal state.
Last year India hosted its first pavilion at the Venice Biennale. This year the country inaugurates a biennale of its own. To be held in the southwestern state of Kerala, the Kochi-Muziris Biennale will feature contemporary painting, film, sculpture, installations, new media and performances by Indian and international artists. Most of the action will unfold in the colonial city of Kochi, whose contemporary art scene already offers more than a dozen venues, from the two-year-old David Hall -- a 1695 Dutch colonial mansion -- to the longstanding Kashi Art Cafe, a restaurant-gallery-garden-cafe. To host the events, the city's 19th-century Durbar Hall and other old buildings are getting top-to-bottom face-lifts.
But the most remarkable historical reclamation project is happening in the biennale's other Kerala site, Muziris. A fabled ancient port that traded spices and silk with Egypt and Greece two millennia ago, Muziris mysteriously vanished sometime after the fall of Rome. Archaeologists have recently located and started to excavate the vanished settlement, which opened to tourists this year. The biennale's start date is Dec. 12, 2012, or 12/12/12. SETH SHERWOOD
22. Paraty, Brazil
Putting Brazil's Costa Verde on the cultural map.
Slide Show
This peaceful hideaway is swiftly becoming the most culturally rich destination in Costa Verde, the 325-mile coastline between Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo. Paraty's cultural calendar includes a three-year-old jazz, blues and soul festival organized by Sao Paulo's top live music venue, the Bourbon Street Music Club. Every June, acts like the American trumpeter Roy Hargrove and the Brazilian trombonist Raul de Souza bring their sounds to the historic quarter's cobblestone streets. Another recently inaugurated event is Paraty Em Foco, a yearly series of photography exhibits showcasing up-and-coming artists from Brazil and beyond. And there's Flip, a literary festival packed with readings, caipirinha-fueled parties and erudite stars like Ian McEwan, Isabel Allende and Salman Rushdie.
Paraty's other attractions include boutiques with tasteful handcrafts, cozy cafes, candlelit seafood restaurants and charming inns. The most stylish is Casa Turquesa, voted best new pousada of 2009 by Guia Quatro Rodas (Brazil's version of the Michelin guide). Late this year, Paraty will get its first high-profile luxury hotel. The French brand Maisons des Reves -- known for its chic Relais & Chateaux lodgings -- plans to open a property near the town's sailboat-lined harbor. PAOLA SINGER
23. Koh Rong, Cambodia
A string of islands recalls an undiscovered Asian paradise.
Slide Show
Many adventurous travelers are looking beyond the temples at Angkor to see what else Cambodia has to offer. One possibility is the Koh Rong Archipelago, whose main island is a 30-minute boat ride from the coastal town of Sihanoukville. Until recently there was no place to stay on this string of islands, but that changes with the opening of the Song Saa resort this year.
Rory Hunter, the owner, and his wife, Melita, discovered the untouched archipelago several years after they moved to Cambodia in 2004. Melita, previously an artist specializing in sculptural art installations, designed Song Saa to resemble a Cambodia fishing village -- at least from the outside. Inside guests will find luxurious contemporary comforts like an infinity pool and Wi-Fi complimented by Asian antiques and market finds, like large driftwood columns, old copper bowls, recycled boat timber walls and century-old Cambodian day beds. (For about $600 per person a night.)
Guests will be able to snorkel with sea horses by day and swim in bioluminescent waters at night. And then there's the food. The resort's chef, Neil Wager, imported from the exclusive North Island resort in the Seychelles, will be serving up his own version of local Khmer cuisine starring sustainable local seafood. GISELA WILLIAMS
24. Vienna
Modern art spruces up Austria's imperial capital.
After a flurry of activity, Vienna's venerable museum scene is prepped for a banner year. July marks the 150th birthday of its native son Gustav Klimt, the Vienna Secessionist master whose dreamily erotic gold-leaf paintings have become some of modernism's most popular (and expensive) works; in a range of exhibitions throughout 2012, more of his pieces will be on display in one place than ever before.
And in a city known for its starchy reluctance to change, two pre-eminent institutions have taken on ambitious new directors: Christoph Thun-Hohenstein, the influential former director of the Austrian Cultural Forum in New York, was announced as the new head of the sprawling Museum of Applied Arts, and the Museum of Modern Art reopened in September after extensive renovations and the appointment of a new director, the German curator Karola Kraus.
Last month, another modern art specialist, 20er Haus, reopened as 21er Haus, an exhibition space and cultural center presenting Austrian art from 1945 to the present. And a new high-profile collaboration, to make its debut this spring, will further strengthen the city's art scene: the contemporary art doyenne Francesca von Habsburg will lend both her keen artistic direction and considerable coffers to Augarten Contemporary at the Belvedere museum, set in a Baroque palace complex. The three-year project, called Thyssen-Bornemisza Augarten Contemporary, weds the Belvedere, one of the city's biggest public art institutions, with Ms. von Habsburg's private foundation, Thyssen-Bornemisza Art Contemporary.

25. Chattanooga, Tenn.
A city stages a comeback fueled by artists and retailers.
In 1969, Walter Cronkite famously called Chattanooga the "dirtiest" city in America. In recent years, though, it has undergone a dramatic overhaul with a radical gentrification plan and an aggressive citywide push to lure artists. In addition to a $120 million clean-up-and-invest 21st Century Waterfront Plan, an incentive program called Arts Move brings artists of all mediums into town; a yearly Southern arts fair called Four Bridges draws thousands each April; and several arts districts have been cultivated and nurtured.
On the heels of this artistic transformation has come the inevitable, yet not unwelcome, boutique boom in places like the recently restored Warehouse Row, a Civil War-era factory turned shopping center filled with local, upscale and artisanal goods. SARAH WILDMAN
26. Dakhla, Morocco
In Morocco's south, an arty hideaway.
Slide Show
Morocco's cool crowd doesn't want anyone else to discover this remote but strangely beautiful desert town on the Atlantic Coast of the Western Sahara, an area with a tumultuous history now governed by Morocco. On a 30-mile-long spit of sand between the ocean and a tranquil lagoon about 600 miles south of Marrakesh, the town is becoming one of the world's greatest wind- and kite-board surfing destinations.
But there's more to Dakhla than high-flying fun. Many come for its fledgling bohemian status: it's a wild, remote, sun-drenched place with a freewheeling atmosphere and plenty of local Tuareg culture. Water temperatures remain a constant 80 degrees year-round, the desert is a short trek away, and the locally caught seafood is delicious. Sleepy during the day thanks to the often intense Saharan heat, the town comes alive after dark with lively cafes and restaurants. Dakhla also finally has a place for nonbackpackers: the Calipau Sahara hotel, a modern riad that opened two years ago, with a long stretch of private beach and a seawater pool. And although part of Dakhla's charm is its relative inaccessibility, Royal Air Maroc offers daily flights from Casablanca. ALEXANDER LOBRANO
27. Maldives
A cushy place for hard-core surfers? Here it is.
When one thinks of the Maldives, a necklace of 26 tropical atolls in the Indian Ocean, one might envision $2,000 suites on stilts over turquoise waters and honeymooners dining barefoot on the beach. But world-class surfers? Not so much. Think again. "It's ideal," said Ross Phillips, founder of Tropicsurf, a leading outfitter in the high-end surfing scene. "Good, consistent waves, warm water, a wide choice of five-star resorts and plenty of things to do for the partners who don't surf." This past summer six world champion surfers headed to the Maldives for what was billed as the world's most exclusive surfing event: Four Seasons Maldives Surfing Champions Trophy, which was held at the Four Seasons Kuda Huraa resort.
Early 2012 will see several new splashy resorts, like the Niyama, which has an underwater restaurant, and the Viceroy, 66 villas on the remote private island of Vagaru. GISELA WILLIAMS
28. Malacca, Malaysia
A World Heritage site ramps up its tourism options.
Slide Show
With its lantern-lighted canals and silent, narrow streets lined with decades-old ornate temples and shop houses, few places in Southeast Asia conjure romantic images of the past as effectively as Malacca, Malaysia's oldest city. A former Portuguese, Dutch and British colony, this Unesco World Heritage site is now attracting record numbers of tourists lured by its unusual architecture and cuisine, which reflect centuries of foreign influences.
More than seven million visitors are expected in 2011, so the town, about 90 miles southeast of the capital, Kuala Lumpur, is welcoming new hotels like the Casa del Rio, a Portuguese-inspired luxury boutique property with 66 rooms; and Courtyard@Heeren, a 100-year-old shop house converted into a 14-room hotel. When you're not exploring places like the 17th-century former Dutch town hall or Jonker Street's antiques shops, gorge on Malacca's outstanding local specialties, like creamy, piquant nyonya laksa at the family-run Donald & Lily's. NAOMI LINDT
29. The Algarve
Portugal's Riviera gets a new spate of luxury hotels.
The Algarve, on Portugal's southern coast, has long been a major package-holiday destination for northern Europeans. But the sun-drenched region is aiming to attract a wider crowd as it recycles itself with a crop of new or renovated luxury hotels emphasizing style, authenticity and eco-friendliness. In Portimao, a perfect example is the just reopened 38-room Hotel Bela Vista. This 1918 villa overlooking the famous seaside Praia da Rocha was renovated by the French hotelier Thierry Naidu and features a stunning design by the Portuguese decorator Graca Viterbo.
There are hotels opening in quieter areas of the Algarve, too, including the striking Martinhal resort in Sagres, and a Conrad hotel scheduled to open in November. Trendy Lisboans are also flocking to Olhao, a former fish-canning town turned resort with stylish lodging options, like the recently opened Real Marina Hotel & Spa, and natural attractions, including the Ria Formosa, a national park made up of one of the largest barrier-reef lagoons in Europe, where you might have the pristine beauty of white sand beaches to yourself -- for now, at least. ALEXANDER LOBRANO
30. Tahoe, Calif.
New lifts, lodging, trails and snowcat rides.
Lake Tahoe's seven major ski areas have been undergoing a dizzying slate of improvements that will eventually tally at least $100 million. Most notable is Squaw Valley's November merger with adjacent Alpine Meadows; at 6,000 acres, it now offers the most ski terrain in the United States. Guests can take a free shuttle between base areas and will find, among other upgrades, new ski school services, expanded terrain parks, a kids' snow-play area with mini-snowmobiles, and new restaurants, including Rocker @ Squaw, a burger joint where skiers can upload their own helmet-cam videos to TV.
Improvements at Northstar, recently acquired by Vail Resorts, include a quad chairlift and an on-mountain restaurant with stellar views of the Pacific Crest. Advanced skiers can explore 170 acres of new gladed terrain or hop a snowcat to ski the Sawtooth Ridge. Likewise, Sierra-at-Tahoe introduced snowcat rides to Huckleberry Canyon. Kirkwood renovated its Mountain Club hotel and Heavenly added three trails, a children's ski school center and a kids' trail. CINDY HIRSCHFELD
31. Wales
A new hiking path brings new views of rugged shores.
Wales's many hiking trails are known for their views of rugged highlands and cliff-hemmed coasts. Exploring the country by foot will become easier in May, when the Wales Coast Path is completed, connecting several disparate paths and creating a 1,030-mile pedestrian route that rings the country. The Wales Coast Path -- which in stretches will be open to cyclists and horseback riders -- follows the Atlantic and the Irish Sea over the length of the country, passing medieval castles and threading through cities including Cardiff and seaside resort towns like Tenby.
While few will have the legs to tackle the entire trail, outfitters including Celtic Trails and Contours Walking Holidays lighten the load by offering inn-to-inn luggage shuttles over several portions of the long distance path. ELAINE GLUSAC
32. Antarctica
Still remote and exotic. Now luxurious too.
A hundred years ago the race to the South Pole held the world in thrall -- poor Robert Falcon Scott lost the title as the first man there, by a month, to the Norwegian Roald Amundsen, and died on his way back through the unforgiving landscape.
The 100-year anniversary of the arrival of these rugged explorers is a reminder of our continued fascination with a region that remains in many ways as remote, exotic and evocative as it ever was. White Desert is marking the event with a new camp that allows travelers to spend the night in accommodations that Amundsen and Scott could only have dreamed of: fiberglass pods with en-suite bathrooms, dressing rooms and comfy beds. During the day, groups (limited to 12 ) pass the time ice climbing, abseiling through open crevasses, kite skiing and visiting colonies of Emperor penguins.
Another way to see the icy scapes is by ship: Abercrombie & Kent's Le Boreal, for example, can navigate some of the smaller fjords and has onboard experts who lecture on everything from wildlife to the history of the region.
Luckily though, the number of overall visitors will remain restricted, guaranteeing, it is hoped, at least another 100 years of relative isolation and pristine wilderness. ONDINE COHANE
33. Uganda
Stability and sustainable tourism restore luster to Africa's pearl.
Marred by the murderous regime of Idi Amin in the 1970s, Uganda remained largely off the typical African safari tour map. But after more than two decades of relative stability under President Yoweri Museveni, the country that Winston Churchill called the "pearl of Africa" is regaining some of its allure for tourists.
While Uganda has not been without problems, including twin bombings in Kampala during the 2010 World Cup, some street clashes during political protests last year and a history of extreme antagonism toward gay people, it's still considered one of the more stable countries in sub-Saharan Africa.
The country is perhaps best known to tourists as the home of half of the world's last remaining mountain gorillas, and this year there are more opportunities to spot the elusive creatures. The Uganda Wildlife Authority recently added two gorilla families to the groups it tracks on tours in Bwindi Impenetrable Forest, a Unesco World Heritage site in southwest Uganda. Sanctuary Gorilla Forest Camp, a luxury tented camp inside the forest, is working with the Batwa Pygmy tribe, indigenous hunter-gatherers who were relocated when the park was established, to share their history and culture with guests. And Country Walkers , based in Waterbury, Vt., is offering its first safari ever in Uganda.
Beyond up-close gorilla encounters, Uganda is also the source of the Nile, boasts mountains that are among the highest in Africa -- the Mountains of the Moon in Rwenzori Mountains National Park -- and offers formidable white-water rapids for thrill seekers. MICHELLE HIGGINS
34. Ukraine
Virginal beaches and czarist palaces -- at Old World prices.
Ukraine has finally seen an influx of much-needed cash to fund its long underdeveloped tourism sector, in part thanks to its selection as a co-host of the 2012 Union of European Football Associations European Championship. Beautiful, historic cities like Kiev, Odessa and Lviv have seen modernization, restoration and fresh cultural energy, but are still cheap, laid-back and largely free of tourist traps. All three cities have revamped their airports and added numerous hotels, restaurants and retail outlets, while new roadwork makes travel outside the city centers easier and more comfortable.
Beach lovers are well advised to head to the Black Sea coast, which extends along the Crimean Peninsula to Odessa. Long a popular beach destination for Russians, the area has slowly begun attracting a wider audience with its pristine beaches, mild climate, jutting cliffs and architectural marvels. CHARLY WILDER
35. Samana Peninsula, Dominican Republic
Unspoiled beaches, but not for long.
For years, the Samana Peninsula on the northeast coast of the Dominican Republic was one of the Caribbean's remaining natural holdouts, largely untouched because of its remote location. But an international airport, El Catey, built near the peninsula's base a few years ago and, more recently, a highway that shortened the drive from Santo Domingo to two hours from five, are bringing new development.
Balcones del Atlaantico, a RockResort that opened last May in the village of Las Terrenas, is the newest luxury resort on the peninsula. Its 86 two- and three-bedroom villas start at $500 a night, supplying a cushy base from which to explore ecotourism. The Peninsula House, a plantation-style estate with just six suites from $580 a night, was named a 2011 Grand Award winner by Andrew Harper's Hideaway Report. And Auberge Resort's' Casa Tropicalia , with 44 beachfront suites and an open-air spa on Samana Bay, is to open in 2014.
There are plenty of off-resort attractions, too. Just last month, Bravaro Runners, an adventure tour operator, opened a new zip-line tour consisting of 20 platforms and 10 zip-lines.
Go now, before the crowds arrive. MICHELLE HIGGINS
36. Dubrovnik, Croatia
The St.-Tropez of the Balkans, equal parts classic and modern.
The last five years have been good to Dubrovnik: as it has opened to Western tourists, its number of visitors has climbed steadily -- around 10 percent a year -- since the global recession hit in 2008. Often called the Jewel of the Adriatic, this seaside city features marble streets, Renaissance fountains and white sand beaches. It has also recently completed an expansion of its airport and a sleek renovation of its cable car system, offering improved city access and views.
Meanwhile, local hoteliers compete to capture the growing stream of high-end tourists, with the 17th-century Pucic Palace , the upscale Excelsior Hotel & Spa and the gorgeous clifftop Villa Dubrovnik all seeing extensive renovations in the last few years. Newer culinary draws include the French-fusion spot Gil's, the two-year-old Panorama and Lucin Kantun, a Croatian tapas restaurant that opened last year in the Old Town. CHARLY WILDER
37. Chiloe Island, Chile
A new look, and controversy, on the edge of South America.
Slide Show
Just off the west coast of Chile, where the land starts to look as if it had been broken apart by a jackhammer, Chiloe Island -- known for its stilt houses, Unesco-anointed churches , nature preserves, unusual wildlife and raw natural beauty -- is getting a facelift. Until recently, the 3,200-square-mile island was mainly a respite for locals. But President Sebastian Pinera has plans to share the island with the rest of the world.
The Chilean government has started pouring billions of pesos into the island's infrastructure and the results are already evident: new paved roads, a new ferry terminal and the soon-to-open Mocopulli Airport in the town of Castro, which will offer direct flights to Santiago. The Chilean power company Ecopower has plans to build a 56-turbine wind farm, which is expected to produce three times the island's power needs. Once construction begins, however, the island could lose many of its migratory birds, penguins and endangered blue whales, environmental groups have cautioned. In other words, the time to go is now.

38. Jordan
New flights and a new modernist airport ease the way for visitors.
It might seem foolhardy for an airline to add a Middle East destination just as much of the Arab world is in political turmoil. But the airline is easyJet, known for its forays into unexpected markets, and the country is Jordan, which has mostly been spared the kind of protests that have toppled leaders elsewhere.
Why get on board? Starting this summer, travelers will be able to disembark at the new state-of-the-art terminal of Queen Alia airport. Designed by Sir Norman Foster using desert and Middle Eastern motifs, the building is a fitting welcome to a country that is trying to modernize while maintaining its natural beauty and traditions.
From there, head to the infinity pool of the new DoubleTree by Hilton hotel in the Red Sea resort of Aqaba. It's a soothing way to wind down after a camel expedition through the Mars-like landscape of nearby Wadi Rum, a 285-square-mile expanse of desert punctuated by wind-eroded rock formations. The region -- "vast, echoing and God-like," in the words of Lawrence of Arabia -- was named a Unesco World Heritage site last year. SETH SHERWOOD
39. Crans-Montana, Switzerland
Restaurants and luxury chalets shine a light on an Alpine resort.
Surprisingly few international tourists visit Crans-Montana, favoring better-known Alpine resorts like Zermatt and Verbier to see and be seen. But with its upmarket designer shops, five-star hotels, Michelin-starred dining and 87 miles of downhill slopes, the word is getting out.
Perched high above the Rhone Valley in western Switzerland on a sunny, south-facing plateau, the two-town resort offers panoramic views of the Matterhorn and Mont Blanc. With more than 250 boutiques, 60 restaurants and 30 hotels, Crans-Montana isn't lacking for apres-ski activities. And new flights from the charter airline Snowjet from London Stansted to Sion airport, about 19 miles from the resort, are making it easier to be on the slopes within an hour of stepping off the plane.
Abercrombie & Kent Villas, a division of the luxury tour company, has taken notice, adding the destination to its collection of luxury ski chalets this season. Weekly rental rates at one of its five 2,700-square-foot chalets, each featuring a Jacuzzi and wine cellar, start at 3,936 euros (about $5,085) for a four-bedroom.
The mountain resort is also celebrated for being the host of the Omega European Masters, among Europe's largest golf events, every September at one of the highest 18-hole golf courses in the Alps, the Severiano Ballesteros. Last year, the Crans-sur-Sierre Golf Club opened the first year-round high-altitude European golf training center so avid duffers can practice their swing despite the snow. MICHELLE HIGGINS
40. Montpellier, France
France's eighth-largest city is dressing up in designer style.
The most celebrated architect in France, Jean Nouvel, and a collaborator, Francois Fontes, introduced their blue and cube-like city hall in November, and early next year Mr. Nouvel's RBC Design Center -- another coolly modernist structure that will house the RBC brand's furniture showroom -- is to open its doors in this medieval, student-filled Mediterranean city.
Even more innovative, the long-awaited Pierres Vives Building from the star architect Zaha Hadid will be ready by year's end. A long, sprawling edifice of swirly white concrete layers and green-tinted glass, the futuristic structure will hold a library, archives and municipal offices.
And to reach them, the city is installing what may be Europe's sexiest tram system. The two existing lines sport exteriors of kaleidoscopic birds and flowers by Christian Lacroix, and two new lines with Mr. Lacroix's trademark color-soaked style are on their way. Both will make their debut this spring with an underwater design theme and a solar theme, respectively, along roughly 17 miles of new track. Think of it as France's longest fashion runway. SETH SHERWOOD
41. Nosara, Costa Rica
Surfing geeks have descended on a remote little town.
With sandy beaches, warm, jade-green waters and rolling waves that rarely get too big, the remote jungle community of Nosara on the Pacific Coast of Costa Rica has become the ideal spot to learn to surf. The crescent-shaped Guiones beach is a good jumping-off point to go hiking or visit the nearby turtle refuge, and there are small, charming hotels and local bars with live music. But in a place that sees sunny, rainless weather from December to May, surfing's the thing.
Surf schools have popped up all over town, including Surf Simply, which focuses on a technical, sports-coach philosophy and has a new guided trip option along the coast for its 2012 surf programs, and Safari Surf School , an official Billabong-certified surf camp. Nosara Surf Cam offers a real-time Web feed of the waves. Take a look and get your stoke on. BONNIE TSUI
42. South Korea
Is golf's newest hot spot in Asia?
South Korea is redefining just how luxurious golf resorts can be. A slew of new private clubs -- the kind with six-digit membership fees, designs by celebrity architects and clubhouses that look like modern art museums -- have opened recently in the country.
The most prestigious is Haesley Nine Bridges, just outside Seoul, with a clubhouse covered by a huge, sinuous web of wooden beams (it also features one of Jeff Koons's giant balloon toy sculptures).
Then there's the Ananti Club, also a commuter's distance from Seoul: 486 acres containing three courses nestled in the Yumyeongsan forest, with a clubhouse, designed by the architect Ken Min, built almost entirely underground. And the futuristic Jack Nicklaus Golf Club Korea, which opened last year in the financial center of Songdo, has a huge, undulating clubhouse designed by the California architect Mehrdad Yazdani.
In 2015, South Korea will be the host of the Presidents Cup for the first time; apparently there are some tournament-worthy courses to go with all those fancy new clubhouses. DANIELLE PERGAMENT
43. Lodz, Poland
The Hollywood of Poland reclaims its industrial past.
Poland's third-largest city and the movie-making headquarters of the country (with a film school that started the careers of Roman Polanski and Andrzej Wajda), Lodz has seen its labyrinth of textile warehouses and industrial-era relics repurposed for artistic and entrepreneurial ventures.
The latest is by the director David Lynch, who has a deal to establish a major film studio in a former 19th-century power plant in the city. Its makeover -- which will also include a planetarium, a library, an exhibition space and a theater -- is scheduled to be shown to the public in 2014. Additionally, the architect Frank Gehry, whose grandparents were from Lodz, is in talks to design a festival and congress center with an avant-garde, building-block shape.
These ventures will be in good company. One Lodz weaving mill is now a retail and entertainment center called Manufaktura, while another, Ms2, is a three-year-old contemporary art museum filled with experimental leanings. A 19th-century industrial complex has been reborn as an art incubator, Lodz Art Center, that is the host of lectures and festivals. RACHEL B. DOYLE
44. Dalarna, Sweden
A storied region offers a getaway from Stockholm.
Most travelers know Sweden only for the urban cool of Stockholm and Gothenburg. But when the sun approaches its summer apex, city dwellers often leave town for one of the country's central provinces, Dalarna. Its deep forests and glimmering lakes host traditional midsummer parties, and every brick-red farmhouse deserves its own postcard. With Dalarna's southern edge only about 125 miles from the capital, getting there -- by car, bus or rail -- is easy enough, though the rustic landscape of "the Dales," as Dalarna translates, can feel worlds apart.
That's made it a natural respite for Swedish painters like Anders Zorn, whose home in the town of Mora is now a museum. Artisans still produce traditional handicrafts like the Dala Horse, a national mascot. But Dalarna is not just for summer journeys: every March, the region hosts the Vasaloppet, one of the world's biggest cross-country ski races, and autumn brings incredible foliage and rich game dishes at restaurants of surprising sophistication like the Dala-Husby Hotell. EVAN RAIL
45. Portovenere, Italy
Stepping in while the Cinque Terre rebuilds.
Slide Show
In late October, torrential rain caused catastrophic mudslides and flooding that devastated Monterosso and Vernazza, two of the cliff-clinging, seaside villages in the famed Cinque Terre on Italy's northwestern coast.
Though the towns are slowly being rebuilt, travelers seeking the pleasures of the area in 2012 should instead consider Portovenere, an equally charming, though largely overlooked, town just south of the Cinque Terre.
Like its more famous neighbors, Portovenere is a traditional fishing village with a picturesque jumble of pastel houses, boats bobbing in the harbor and a network of meandering hiking trails. But here, crowds are sparse, so poke around the 13th-century, black-and-white striated church in peace, before marveling at the views across the glittering Bay of La Spezia, which has long inspired poets and writers, from Lord Byron to D.H. Lawrence. INGRID K. WILLIAMS
Correction: January 22, 2012, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The cover article on Jan. 8 about 45 places to go in 2012 contained errors in the entries for 4, 20, 34 and 37, about London, space, Ukraine and Chiloe Island, Chile.
The Charles Dickens Museum in London is now open; it is not reopening in time for the author's 200th birthday, Feb. 7. Because of an editing error, both the Waldorf-Astoria hotel and Heathrow Airport were described as being east of London; they are west of the city.
The location of the spaceport from which Virgin Galactic flights into space will depart is about 55 miles north of Las Cruces, N.M.; it is not in Las Cruces.
Ukraine is a co-host of the Union of European Football Associations Championship, not the host.
And a wind turbine project in Chiloe Island, Chile, is expected to produce three times the island's power needs; it will not triple the island's power needs.

Abstract: Since November 2010, when Myanmar's rulers held nominally free elections and released Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi after 15 years of house arrest, the boycott has been lifted and Myanmar is set for an influx of visitors. Because the country has been so isolated, the deeply Buddhist "Land of the Golden Pagoda" resonates with a strong sense of place, undiluted by mass tourism and warmed by genuine hospitality.

Full text: CORRECTION APPENDED
1. Panama
Go for the canal. Stay for everything else.
It's been 12 years since Panama regained control of its canal, and the country's economy is booming. Cranes stalk the skyline of the capital, Panama City, where high-rises sprout one after the next and immigrants arrive daily from around the world. Among those who have landed en masse in recent years are American expatriates and investors, who have banked on Panamanian real estate by building hotels and buying retirement homes. The passage of the United States-Panama free trade agreement in October is expected to accelerate this international exchange of people and dollars (the countries use the same currency).
Among the notable development projects is the Panama Canal itself, which is in the early stages of a multibillion-dollar expansion. The project will widen and deepen the existing canal and add two locks, doubling the canal's cargo capacity. For those who want to see the waterway as it was originally designed, now is the time. The expansion is expected to be completed by 2014, the canal's 100-year anniversary.
Other high-profile projects include the construction of three firsts: The Panamera, the first Waldorf Astoria hotel in Latin America (set to open in June 2012); the Trump Ocean Club, the region's tallest building, which opened last summer; and Frank Gehry's first Latin American design, the BioMuseo, a natural history museum scheduled to open in early 2013. Even Panama City's famously dilapidated historic quarter, Casco Viejo, has been transformed. The neighborhood, a tangle of narrow streets, centuries-old houses and neo-colonial government buildings, was designated a Unesco World Heritage site in 1997 and is now a trendy arts district with galleries, coffeehouses, street musicians and some of the city's most stylish restaurants and boutique hotels.
Across the isthmus, on Panama's Caribbean coast, the Bocas del Toro archipelago has become a popular stop on the backpacker circuit, with snorkeling and zip lining by day and raucous night life after dark. FREDA MOON
2. Helsinki, Finland
Design. Design. Design. Aesthetics fuel a new cool.
Copenhagen's culinary awakening and Stockholm's trend-setting fashion may have ignited the world's current infatuation with Nordic culture; now Helsinki is poised for the spotlight. The International Council of Societies of Industrial Design has designated it the World Design Capital for 2012.
Design has long been part of the city's DNA, but in recent years the scene has been increasingly energized: the official Design District has ballooned to encompass 25 streets and nearly 200 design-minded businesses, which range from shops selling housewares and furniture to boutique hotels and clothing stores. Design has infiltrated the restaurant scene as well, notably the elegant Chez Dominique and the hot newcomer (and Michelin-starred) Olo.
On top of all that is the spectacular new $242 million Helsinki Music Center. Student ensembles from the Sibelius Academy -- the sole university in Finland devoted exclusively to music -- will perform in the striking glass-walled space, and both the Vienna Philharmonic and the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestras will give concerts in 2012. INGRID K. WILLIAMS
3. Myanmar
Back on the tourist map after being off-limits for years.
With renowned cultural treasures, world-class boutique hotels and deserted beaches, Myanmar has long been high on intrepid travelers' wish lists. For years, though, heeding calls by the pro-democracy leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and others, many stayed away in protest of Myanmar's authoritarian regime.
Now, however, this is changing.
Since November 2010, when Myanmar's rulers held nominally free elections and released Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi after 15 years of house arrest, the boycott has been lifted and Myanmar is set for an influx of visitors.
Because the country has been so isolated, the deeply Buddhist "Land of the Golden Pagoda" resonates with a strong sense of place, undiluted by mass tourism and warmed by genuine hospitality. Travelers will find atmospheric hotels and a network of well-maintained regional jets serving the main sites. (Keep in mind that visas are still required and that the economy remains largely cash-based.)
But locals are aware of the potential downside of tourism as well. Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi has called for sustainable development and "trickle down" tourism where dollars will do the most good.
With these goals in mind, nestled along the banks of meandering Lake Inle in eastern Myanmar, the ViewPoint eco-lodge combines locally sourced materials with individually tailored activities supporting the local economy (like garden-to-table lunches at an island village house).
Similarly, in Ngapali Beach -- a pristine swath of coastline on the Bay of Bengal -- the Amara Ocean Resort ratchets up the om factor with a hand-built spa. The resort finances relief projects in the Irrawaddy River delta. CEIL MILLER-BOUCHET
4. London
The Olympics! The Queen! Charles Dickens turns 200!
Dotted with construction sites, London is preparing for the pomp and circumstance of the Olympic Games and the Diamond Jubilee celebration of the Queen's 60th year on the throne. New stadiums, public spaces and shopping centers are emerging on the city's eastern edge, and on the western edge a 137-room Waldorf Astoria has opened on a 400-acre estate near Heathrow Airport.
But it's not all sport and royalty. On a street of chocolate-box Georgian houses in Bloomsbury, the Charles Dickens Museum will reopen in time for the author's 200th birthday. Across town, Warner Brothers Studio Tour will open the Harry Potter studios to those keen to re-live the films. The Rolling Stones, celebrating their 50th anniversary, might tour again, with a possible finale here. And Robert Redford will inaugurate a London outpost of the Sundance Film festival at the O2 Arena in April.
Amid the hubbub, flashes of eccentricity emerge. If the Waldorf doesn't appeal, stay in an architect-designed boat, perched on the edge of a roof overlooking the Thames. Or visit the British outpost of Occupy London, which will be maintaining its tent city outside St. Paul's cathedral. RAVI SOMAIYA
5. Oakland, Calif.
New restaurants and bars beckon amid the grit.
Tensions have cooled since violence erupted at the recent Occupy Oakland protests, but the city's revitalized night-life scene has continued to smolder.
The historic Fox Theater reopened in 2009 and quickly cemented its status as one of the Bay Area's top music venues, drawing acts like Wilco and the Decemberists. Meanwhile, the city's ever more sophisticated restaurants are now being joined by upscale cocktail bars, turning once-gritty Oakland into an increasingly appealing place to be after dark. James Syhabout, the chef who earned Oakland its first (and only) Michelin star two years ago at Commis, followed up in May with the instant-hit Hawker Fare, a casual spot serving Asian street food. Big-name San Francisco chefs are now joining him. Daniel Patterson (of two-Michelin-star Coi) opened the restaurant Plum in late 2010 and an adjacent cocktail bar later, and another restaurant, called Haven, in the recently renovated Jack London Square last month. INGRID K. WILLIAMS
6. Tokyo
With some tourists slow to return, greater opportunities for those who do.
The thought of traveling to Tokyo will most likely make some people nervous. Though the city is about 180 miles from the Fukushima Daiichi power plant, the site of the worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl -- and the State Department recommends travelers avoid only the area directly around the disaster site -- Tokyo has suffered as well, a problem of perception as much as reality.
But from another vantage point, it's a perfect time to visit. A decrease in tourism and business travel is making the city all the more accessible and welcoming. According to Laurent Vernhes, a founder and the chief executive of TabletHotels.com, a travel site with a curated list of distinctive lodging options, tourism hasn't yet returned to normal levels. "Rates are still down about 10 percent on average compared to the same time last year," Mr. Vernhes said.
When I visited the city in the fall, it was clear that it is still crackling with energy. But now it's possible to get a previously unthinkable last-minute reservation at one of the city's many world-class restaurants or a room in hotels usually booked solid. A Saturday night dinner at Kagurazaka Ishikawa, a pricey but discreet restaurant with three Michelin stars and an artful tasting menu? No problem. And lodging options for all budgets have gotten easier. Chances are you can find a room at the elegant Park Hyatt Tokyo, a luxurious high-rise, or at the Tokyo Ryokan, a family-run hotel with just three simple bedrooms that often are reserved well in advance. OLIVER STRAND
Note: An earlier version of the subheading with this entry has been changed because it was unintentionally insensitive in making a link between last year's tragedy in Japan and the opportunity for tourism.
7. Tanzania
Coming into its own as an upscale safari destination.
For the last several years the number of tourists going to Tanzania has been edging up, according to East African travel specialists like Hippo Creek Safaris and Abercrombie & Kent. But it wasn't until several violent attacks on visitors to neighboring Kenya that the numbers really took off, as Tanzania started to absorb skittish Kenya-bound safari seekers.
Not that Tanzania is coasting along solely on Kenya's troubles; it's always had Mount Kilimanjaro, after all. And now other attractions are being discovered, too -- places like Gibb's Farm, a small lodge from which guests can hike to the Ngorongoro Crater area, a prime destination for big game viewing. In addition, the opening of exclusive safari reserves like the Singita Grumeti and the upscale camps managed by Nomad Tanzania and Chem Chem are evidence that the country's tourist infrastructure is becoming more sophisticated, perhaps even catching up to Kenya's. GISELA WILLIAMS
8. Chilean Patagonia
Proof that adventure doesn't have to mean roughing it.
With its mix of snowy peaks, pristine rain forest and network of virgin national parks, Chile is emerging as one of the world's adventure hot spots and now has a spate of rugged luxury lodges in which adventure-seekers can stay.
Puma Lodge, a glass-and-wood design showcase about an hour and a half south of Santiago, features heli-skiing through miles of untouched powder, and outside of Patagonia's Torres del Paine Park, the brand-new Tierra Patagonia offers activities like horseback riding over the steppes and boat outings on a glacial lake (while also offering creature comforts like a spa and a heated indoor pool). Meanwhile, the latest Singular property, which also opened in November outside the park, leads expeditions into the nearby glaciers. For custom trips, pioneers to the region like Cazenove & Loyd can help navigate the logistical challenges of criss-crossing Chile's dramatic landscapes. ONDINE COHANE
9. Lhasa, Tibet
New luxury hotels bring respite -- and controversy.
Tibet's holy capital is in the throes of a luxury-hotel boom. In Lhasa, this is news: not only is operating an upscale hotel at nearly 12,000 feet above sea level no small feat, but real-estate developments here are, almost by default, also culturally loaded.
The majestic, 162-room St. Regis Lhasa Resort has been in full operation since May. In 2010, a charming Tibetan-owned villa called the Lingtsang reopened as a boutique hotel with opulent, colorful woodwork and courtyard verandas. And coming soon are the sprawling InterContinental Resort Lhasa Paradise and the 284-room Shangri-La, both scheduled to open in 2013.
On the upside, it's the first time that travelers can get high-end amenities in a city where even basic hospitality has been a challenge. On the downside, the openings -- like Lhasa's booming population, new business districts and shopping malls -- are seen by many Tibetans and interested outsiders as more cultural colonization and exploitation of a sacred land. KIMBERLY BRADLEY
10. Havana, Cuba
The Cuban capital is once again within Americans' reach.
The only thing that lies between Americans and the sultry streets of Havana these days is the Florida Straits, since the Obama administration has widened the kind of travel allowed. A growing list of organizations have licenses to operate trips to Cuba, including National Geographic Expeditions, Austin-Lehman and the Center for Cuban Studies. There are also more flights from more American cities: Fort Lauderdale and Tampa recently joined New York, Miami and Los Angeles on the list, and Chicago will be added this year.
The "people-to-people" rules require Americans to interact with Cubans (sun-and-sand vacations are still prohibited) so tours involve meeting with art historians, organic farmers and others. Conveniently, new restaurants and bed-and-breakfasts, some in gorgeous colonial villas, have sprung up over the past year as the government has allowed more private enterprise. Havana is also gearing up for its 11th Biennial, from May 11 to June 11, which will draw more than 100 Cuban and international artists. VICTORIA BURNETT
11. Moscow
New cultural venues add a dash of the sacred and profane.
The extravagantly renovated Bolshoi Theater has been preening like a prima donna before the news media's flashbulbs since it reopened in October. And given the $760 million face-lift to the 236-year-old grand dame you can almost hear the czars applauding from their tombs.
But beyond the spotlight, two compelling museums have also made their debuts. The Russian Icon Museum is said to hold the largest private collection of Russian and Eastern Christian religious artwork (some 4,000 pieces). Admission to the museum is free.
You won't find many virgins or saints at Tochka G, whose name translates as "G Spot." With more than 3,000 sex-related items, the bounty includes everything from Soviet-era condoms to high-tech sex dolls to "Wrestling," a 2011 painting by the Russian artist Vera Donskaya-Khilko that depicts a buff Vladimir Putin and Barack Obama challenging each other with their cartoonishly oversized phalluses. In Russia, size does matter. SETH SHERWOOD
12. Glasgow
Zaha Hadid takes on a Scottish waterfront.
Scotland's second city now has a $115 million museum designed by Zaha Hadid to go with its shiny new harbor and river promenade.
The Riverside Museum, which opened in June, is housed in a stunning building on the waterfront, with a 3,000-piece collection devoted to Glasgow's rich shipbuilding and engineering past. Its location, along the River Clyde, was once home to many shipyards, and considered the economic heart of Glasgow. But when the industry left, the area stagnated.
Not anymore. Glasgow has spent more than a decade redeveloping 130 acres of derelict shipyard and unused dockland in an effort to restore the waterway to its former glory. Now there's a pleasant riverside walkway with steel street furniture, cobblestones from Victorian Glasgow and maritime paraphernalia. Lime trees are planted on both sides of the esplanade, and there are bicycle paths throughout. A new ferry stop for the Riverside Museum, which just saw its one-millionth visitor, marks the first time in around 50 years that this section of the river has had regular passenger service. RACHEL B. DOYLE
13. Puebla, Mexico
International mole festival. Need we say more?
May 5, 2012, is the 150-year anniversary of Cinco de Mayo, the date when, in 1862, an outmanned Mexican army defeated the French troops of Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte. The occasion will be marked with a fiesta in Puebla, the chief spot in Mexico that celebrates the holiday. Ahead of the May festival, the city, the affluent capital of one of Mexico's safest states, is building a light rail line similar to the one in Mexico City and renovating public spaces. Privately, Museo Amparo, which holds one of the country's most impressive collections of indigenous and colonial-era artifacts, has undergone a $17 million update and expansion.
But the city's biggest draw might be its famous mole poblano. The city is inaugurating an international mole festival which will begin on May 2. Hopes are that it will attract celebrity chefs like Rick Bayless, who recently took staff members to Puebla's Mural de los Poblanos restaurant for their annual employee trip. FREDA MOON
14. San Diego
With breweries and brewpubs, a sunny heaven for suds lovers.
Slide Show
Even in times of tight budgets, finely crafted beer remains a relatively approachable luxury, and few American regions have more brewing momentum than San Diego County. Maybe it's time, then, to think about building a beer safari in the land of sunshine, fish tacos and hopped-up American IPAs. Long established craft breweries like Karl Strauss Brewing Company and the cheeky Stone Brewing Company have mentored brewmasters and created demand for some seriously offbeat ales.
The area has long been a hotbed of garage-based hobbyists, so it's no surprise that the region also has a tradition of dedicated home brewing. The result is a cluster of small breweries, like the tiny but soon-to-expand Hess Brewing.
And there are numerous opportunities for rigorous but never dour beer tastings, at staggeringly comprehensive shops like Bottlecraft Beer Shop & Tasting Room and Pizza Port Bottle Shop, as well as beer-obsessed taverns like Hamilton's and O'Brien's and restaurants like Local Habit. Those looking for full immersion can pack a stein for the fourth annual San Diego Beer Week in November. SARA DICKERMAN
15. Halong Bay, Vietnam
New ways to visit a natural wonder in Southeast Asia.
Slide Show
Though Halong Bay, a staggering seascape of some 1,600 limestone islands and islets in the Gulf of Tonkin, formed over millions of years, there's never been a better time to visit. In November, the Unesco World Heritage site was provisionally named one of the world's "new seven wonders of nature" based on a global poll conducted by the Swiss foundation New7Wonders -- just as Vietnam Airlines announced the first-ever nonstop flights between London and Vietnam. Largely untouched by humans and topped with thick jungle flora, the rock formations rise dramatically in conical peaks and pillars from the surrounding waters, which feature offshore coral reefs, freshwater swamps, mangrove forests and sandy beaches. Visitors can now reach what Ho Chi Minh himself called "the wonder one cannot impart to others," on local junk boats, luxury cruises or a spate of new adventure tours offered by companies like InterAsia, World Expeditions and the Luxury Travel Group.

16. Florence, Italy
A Renaissance city gets a contemporary kick.
Since 2009, Florence's youthful mayor, Matteo Renzi, has championed efforts to build a livable, living city that celebrates -- but is not yoked to -- its rich history (and historic riches). The result? An energized arts scene unfolding inside various medieval palazzi, ancient landmarks restored and reopened to the public for the first time in decades and restaurants abandoning traditional Tuscan staples for sophisticated contemporary food.
The grand 15th-century Palazzo Strozzi is now home to the Center for Contemporary Culture Strozzina, a destination for must-see events like the coming "Americans in Florence: Sargent and the American Impressionists," which opens in March. Spazi Urbani Contemporanei, an arts space occupying a 15th-century former monastery, now features works from emerging Italian artists. Last year, the 148- foot-tall 14th-century San Niccolo tower reopened to the public with one of the best panoramic views of the city. And in September, the flagship Gucci Museum made its debut in the historic Palazzo della Mercanzia.
The city's stock of refined hotel offerings has also been elevated by the opulent new St. Regis Florence, which opened in a palatial riverside palazzo in May, and the Grand Hotel Villa Cora, another five-star stunner near the Boboli Gardens. Even the once-staid Florentine dining scene has been reborn with new restaurants like IO Osteria Personale and Ossi di Seppia.
Next for the Tuscan capital are plans to restore the banks of the Arno River and spruce up the city's largest park. INGRID K. WILLIAMS
17. St. Vincent
A new resort may put this Caribbean island on the map.
The fact that American Airlines does not fly there could explain why St. Vincent remains among the Caribbean's best-kept secrets: a stunningly lush, unspoiled gem of an island surrounded by water cerulean enough to render that of other islands murky by comparison. What there is here -- a climbable volcano, dramatic waterfalls, black-sand beaches -- is dwarfed by what there isn't: chain stores, crowds, big hotels.
Except, that is, for one notably new exception. Buccament Bay, a five-star resort, opened in the fall and boasts more rooms, about 360, than all other hotels on the island combined. And there are the resort's five restaurants, a spa, a soccer camp and performing arts center. The resort, along with a new international airport that is scheduled to open in late 2013 and designed to handle five times the number of passengers currently arriving at the island, will most likely let the cat out of the bag and attract the long overdue crowds. Get there before they do. BAZ DREISINGER
18. Moganshan, China
Luxury in the former mountain hideaway of Shanghai gangsters.
Slide Show
For much of the early 20th century, Moganshan, a bamboo-covered mountain about three hours from Shanghai, served as a tranquil retreat for the elite. Wealthy foreigners took up residence on the mountain first, building stone villas and tennis courts. Then came the Chinese power brokers, including the Shanghai mob boss Du Yuesheng and the Kuomintang leader Chiang Kai-shek, who honeymooned here in 1927.
After a lull, the past decade has seen foreigners repopulating Moganshan's sleepy slopes, transforming old villas into homes and guesthouses. And in late 2011, the mountain went upscale with two new luxury properties. The 121-room eco-resort Naked Stables features tree-top villas with Jacuzzis set on balconies overlooking the mountains, and African-inspired "earth huts" built with environmentally friendly rammed-earth walls. Set on a tea plantation, the 40-room Le Passage Moganshan, which partly opened in December, takes its inspiration from Moganshan's historic manor homes, with century-old recycled wood floors and a magnificent garden planted with 12,000 rose bushes.

19. Birmingham, England
Could England's second city be first in food?
Olive, the BBC's food magazine, recently startled British gourmands when it declared Birmingham, England's second largest city, the United Kingdom's "foodiest town," ahead of London and Edinburgh. The award came last October, just as Birmingham was hosting an annual festival, the 10-day Birmingham Food Fest, which featured such local talents as Aktar Islam of Lasan Restaurant; up-and-comers like David Colcombe of Opus, Andy Waters of Edmunds Restaurant and Steve Love of Loves Restaurant; and a troika of Michelin-starred chefs: Glynn Purnell of Purnell's; Andreas Antona, Luke Tipping and Adam Bennett of Simpsons Restaurant; and Richard Turner of Turners of Harborne.
The chefs are building on an already rich dining scene. Birmingham is famous in Britain for its Balti Triangle, an area of town that is home to a beloved Pakistani-Kashmiri curry dish invented here; it is also birthplace to such classically British food items as Typhoo Tea, Bird's Custard and HP Sauce.

20. Space
The final frontier now has a ticket agent.
It's not just the imaginings of science fiction geeks. Pretty soon anyone with $200,000 will be able to travel to the last frontier: space or -- more specifically -- the upper edge of Earth's atmosphere. In 2004 Richard Branson founded Virgin Galactic with the primary goal of pioneering commercial flights to space. Last year the company began test-flying SpaceShipTwo, an aircraft that will enable two pilots and six passengers to travel to suborbital space. Although no launch date has been confirmed (a 2012 date was pushed back to 2013), about 450 people from around the globe have already purchased tickets; the first passengers will be (surprise!) Richard Branson and his two children, Sam and Holly.
Flights will take off from the brand-new spaceport near Las Cruces, N.M., but Virgin Galactic "Space Agent" Joshua Bush of Park Avenue Travel in Philadelphia, predicts that in a few years "We'll eventually be able to take off from New York, orbit the Earth and then land in Tokyo in two or three hours." What will it be like? "After the rocket motor turns off there is complete silence," said Mr. Bush, who has read about the experiences of many astronauts. "You look out the window and see a thin blue line of the atmosphere and comprehend how small and insignificant we are." GISELA WILLIAMS
21. Kerala, India
A new Indian biennale will make its debut in this coastal state.
Last year India hosted its first pavilion at the Venice Biennale. This year the country inaugurates a biennale of its own. To be held in the southwestern state of Kerala, the Kochi-Muziris Biennale will feature contemporary painting, film, sculpture, installations, new media and performances by Indian and international artists. Most of the action will unfold in the colonial city of Kochi, whose contemporary art scene already offers more than a dozen venues, from the two-year-old David Hall -- a 1695 Dutch colonial mansion -- to the longstanding Kashi Art Cafe, a restaurant-gallery-garden-cafe. To host the events, the city's 19th-century Durbar Hall and other old buildings are getting top-to-bottom face-lifts.
But the most remarkable historical reclamation project is happening in the biennale's other Kerala site, Muziris. A fabled ancient port that traded spices and silk with Egypt and Greece two millennia ago, Muziris mysteriously vanished sometime after the fall of Rome. Archaeologists have recently located and started to excavate the vanished settlement, which opened to tourists this year. The biennale's start date is Dec. 12, 2012, or 12/12/12. SETH SHERWOOD
22. Paraty, Brazil
Putting Brazil's Costa Verde on the cultural map.
Slide Show
This peaceful hideaway is swiftly becoming the most culturally rich destination in Costa Verde, the 325-mile coastline between Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo. Paraty's cultural calendar includes a three-year-old jazz, blues and soul festival organized by Sao Paulo's top live music venue, the Bourbon Street Music Club. Every June, acts like the American trumpeter Roy Hargrove and the Brazilian trombonist Raul de Souza bring their sounds to the historic quarter's cobblestone streets. Another recently inaugurated event is Paraty Em Foco, a yearly series of photography exhibits showcasing up-and-coming artists from Brazil and beyond. And there's Flip, a literary festival packed with readings, caipirinha-fueled parties and erudite stars like Ian McEwan, Isabel Allende and Salman Rushdie.
Paraty's other attractions include boutiques with tasteful handcrafts, cozy cafes, candlelit seafood restaurants and charming inns. The most stylish is Casa Turquesa, voted best new pousada of 2009 by Guia Quatro Rodas (Brazil's version of the Michelin guide). Late this year, Paraty will get its first high-profile luxury hotel. The French brand Maisons des Reves -- known for its chic Relais & Chateaux lodgings -- plans to open a property near the town's sailboat-lined harbor. PAOLA SINGER
23. Koh Rong, Cambodia
A string of islands recalls an undiscovered Asian paradise.
Slide Show
Many adventurous travelers are looking beyond the temples at Angkor to see what else Cambodia has to offer. One possibility is the Koh Rong Archipelago, whose main island is a 30-minute boat ride from the coastal town of Sihanoukville. Until recently there was no place to stay on this string of islands, but that changes with the opening of the Song Saa resort this year.
Rory Hunter, the owner, and his wife, Melita, discovered the untouched archipelago several years after they moved to Cambodia in 2004. Melita, previously an artist specializing in sculptural art installations, designed Song Saa to resemble a Cambodia fishing village -- at least from the outside. Inside guests will find luxurious contemporary comforts like an infinity pool and Wi-Fi complimented by Asian antiques and market finds, like large driftwood columns, old copper bowls, recycled boat timber walls and century-old Cambodian day beds. (For about $600 per person a night.)
Guests will be able to snorkel with sea horses by day and swim in bioluminescent waters at night. And then there's the food. The resort's chef, Neil Wager, imported from the exclusive North Island resort in the Seychelles, will be serving up his own version of local Khmer cuisine starring sustainable local seafood. GISELA WILLIAMS
24. Vienna
Modern art spruces up Austria's imperial capital.
After a flurry of activity, Vienna's venerable museum scene is prepped for a banner year. July marks the 150th birthday of its native son Gustav Klimt, the Vienna Secessionist master whose dreamily erotic gold-leaf paintings have become some of modernism's most popular (and expensive) works; in a range of exhibitions throughout 2012, more of his pieces will be on display in one place than ever before.
And in a city known for its starchy reluctance to change, two pre-eminent institutions have taken on ambitious new directors: Christoph Thun-Hohenstein, the influential former director of the Austrian Cultural Forum in New York, was announced as the new head of the sprawling Museum of Applied Arts, and the Museum of Modern Art reopened in September after extensive renovations and the appointment of a new director, the German curator Karola Kraus.
Last month, another modern art specialist, 20er Haus, reopened as 21er Haus, an exhibition space and cultural center presenting Austrian art from 1945 to the present. And a new high-profile collaboration, to make its debut this spring, will further strengthen the city's art scene: the contemporary art doyenne Francesca von Habsburg will lend both her keen artistic direction and considerable coffers to Augarten Contemporary at the Belvedere museum, set in a Baroque palace complex. The three-year project, called Thyssen-Bornemisza Augarten Contemporary, weds the Belvedere, one of the city's biggest public art institutions, with Ms. von Habsburg's private foundation, Thyssen-Bornemisza Art Contemporary. (For more on Vienna, see the 36 Hours column on page 11.) CHARLY WILDER
25. Chattanooga, Tenn.
A city stages a comeback fueled by artists and retailers.
In 1969, Walter Cronkite famously called Chattanooga the "dirtiest" city in America. In recent years, though, it has undergone a dramatic overhaul with a radical gentrification plan and an aggressive citywide push to lure artists. In addition to a $120 million clean-up-and-invest 21st Century Waterfront Plan, an incentive program called Arts Move brings artists of all mediums into town; a yearly Southern arts fair called Four Bridges draws thousands each April; and several arts districts have been cultivated and nurtured.
On the heels of this artistic transformation has come the inevitable, yet not unwelcome, boutique boom in places like the recently restored Warehouse Row, a Civil War-era factory turned shopping center filled with local, upscale and artisanal goods. SARAH WILDMAN
26. Dakhla, Morocco
In Morocco's south, an arty hideaway.
Slide Show
Morocco's cool crowd doesn't want anyone else to discover this remote but strangely beautiful desert town on the Atlantic Coast of the Western Sahara, an area with a tumultuous history now governed by Morocco. On a 30-mile-long spit of sand between the ocean and a tranquil lagoon about 600 miles south of Marrakesh, the town is becoming one of the world's greatest wind- and kite-board surfing destinations.
But there's more to Dakhla than high-flying fun. Many come for its fledgling bohemian status: it's a wild, remote, sun-drenched place with a freewheeling atmosphere and plenty of local Tuareg culture. Water temperatures remain a constant 80 degrees year-round, the desert is a short trek away, and the locally caught seafood is delicious. Sleepy during the day thanks to the often intense Saharan heat, the town comes alive after dark with lively cafes and restaurants. Dakhla also finally has a place for nonbackpackers: the Calipau Sahara hotel, a modern riad that opened two years ago, with a long stretch of private beach and a seawater pool. And although part of Dakhla's charm is its relative inaccessibility, Royal Air Maroc offers daily flights from Casablanca. ALEXANDER LOBRANO
27. Maldives
A cushy place for hard-core surfers? Here it is.
When one thinks of the Maldives, a necklace of 26 tropical atolls in the Indian Ocean, one might envision $2,000 suites on stilts over turquoise waters and honeymooners dining barefoot on the beach. But world-class surfers? Not so much. Think again. "It's ideal," said Ross Phillips, founder of Tropicsurf, a leading outfitter in the high-end surfing scene. "Good, consistent waves, warm water, a wide choice of five-star resorts and plenty of things to do for the partners who don't surf." This past summer six world champion surfers headed to the Maldives for what was billed as the world's most exclusive surfing event: Four Seasons Maldives Surfing Champions Trophy, which was held at the Four Seasons Kuda Huraa resort.
Early 2012 will see several new splashy resorts, like the Niyama, which has an underwater restaurant, and the Viceroy, 66 villas on the remote private island of Vagaru. GISELA WILLIAMS
28. Malacca, Malaysia
A World Heritage site ramps up its tourism options.
Slide Show
With its lantern-lighted canals and silent, narrow streets lined with decades-old ornate temples and shop houses, few places in Southeast Asia conjure romantic images of the past as effectively as Malacca, Malaysia's oldest city. A former Portuguese, Dutch and British colony, this Unesco World Heritage site is now attracting record numbers of tourists lured by its unusual architecture and cuisine, which reflect centuries of foreign influences.
More than seven million visitors are expected in 2011, so the town, about 90 miles southeast of the capital, Kuala Lumpur, is welcoming new hotels like the Casa del Rio, a Portuguese-inspired luxury boutique property with 66 rooms; and Courtyard@Heeren, a 100-year-old shop house converted into a 14-room hotel. When you're not exploring places like the 17th-century former Dutch town hall or Jonker Street's antiques shops, gorge on Malacca's outstanding local specialties, like creamy, piquant nyonya laksa at the family-run Donald & Lily's. NAOMI LINDT
29. The Algarve
Portugal's Riviera gets a new spate of luxury hotels.
The Algarve, on Portugal's southern coast, has long been a major package-holiday destination for northern Europeans. But the sun-drenched region is aiming to attract a wider crowd as it recycles itself with a crop of new or renovated luxury hotels emphasizing style, authenticity and eco-friendliness. In Portimao, a perfect example is the just reopened 38-room Hotel Bela Vista. This 1918 villa overlooking the famous seaside Praia da Rocha was renovated by the French hotelier Thierry Naidu and features a stunning design by the Portuguese decorator Graca Viterbo.
There are hotels opening in quieter areas of the Algarve, too, including the striking Martinhal resort in Sagres, and a Conrad hotel scheduled to open in November. Trendy Lisboans are also flocking to Olhao, a former fish-canning town turned resort with stylish lodging options, like the recently opened Real Marina Hotel & Spa, and natural attractions, including the Ria Formosa, a national park made up of one of the largest barrier-reef lagoons in Europe, where you might have the pristine beauty of white sand beaches to yourself -- for now, at least. ALEXANDER LOBRANO
30. Tahoe, Calif.
New lifts, lodging, trails and snowcat rides.
Lake Tahoe's seven major ski areas have been undergoing a dizzying slate of improvements that will eventually tally at least $100 million. Most notable is Squaw Valley's November merger with adjacent Alpine Meadows; at 6,000 acres, it now offers the most ski terrain in the United States. Guests can take a free shuttle between base areas and will find, among other upgrades, new ski school services, expanded terrain parks, a kids' snow-play area with mini-snowmobiles, and new restaurants, including Rocker @ Squaw, a burger joint where skiers can upload their own helmet-cam videos to TV.
Improvements at Northstar, recently acquired by Vail Resorts, include a quad chairlift and an on-mountain restaurant with stellar views of the Pacific Crest. Advanced skiers can explore 170 acres of new gladed terrain or hop a snowcat to ski the Sawtooth Ridge. Likewise, Sierra-at-Tahoe introduced snowcat rides to Huckleberry Canyon. Kirkwood renovated its Mountain Club hotel and Heavenly added three trails, a children's ski school center and a kids' trail. CINDY HIRSCHFELD
31. Wales
A new hiking path brings new views of rugged shores.
Wales's many hiking trails are known for their views of rugged highlands and cliff-hemmed coasts. Exploring the country by foot will become easier in May, when the Wales Coast Path is completed, connecting several disparate paths and creating a 1,030-mile pedestrian route that rings the country. The Wales Coast Path -- which in stretches will be open to cyclists and horseback riders -- follows the Atlantic and the Irish Sea over the length of the country, passing medieval castles and threading through cities including Cardiff and seaside resort towns like Tenby.
While few will have the legs to tackle the entire trail, outfitters including Celtic Trails and Contours Walking Holidays lighten the load by offering inn-to-inn luggage shuttles over several portions of the long distance path. ELAINE GLUSAC
32. Antarctica
Still remote and exotic. Now luxurious too.
A hundred years ago the race to the South Pole held the world in thrall -- poor Robert Falcon Scott lost the title as the first man there, by a month, to the Norwegian Roald Amundsen, and died on his way back through the unforgiving landscape.
The 100-year anniversary of the arrival of these rugged explorers is a reminder of our continued fascination with a region that remains in many ways as remote, exotic and evocative as it ever was. White Desert is marking the event with a new camp that allows travelers to spend the night in accommodations that Amundsen and Scott could only have dreamed of: fiberglass pods with en-suite bathrooms, dressing rooms and comfy beds. During the day, groups (limited to 12 ) pass the time ice climbing, abseiling through open crevasses, kite skiing and visiting colonies of Emperor penguins.
Another way to see the icy scapes is by ship: Abercrombie & Kent's Le Boreal, for example, can navigate some of the smaller fjords and has onboard experts who lecture on everything from wildlife to the history of the region.
Luckily though, the number of overall visitors will remain restricted, guaranteeing, it is hoped, at least another 100 years of relative isolation and pristine wilderness. ONDINE COHANE
33. Uganda
Stability and sustainable tourism restore luster to Africa's pearl.
Marred by the murderous regime of Idi Amin in the 1970s, Uganda remained largely off the typical African safari tour map. But after more than two decades of relative stability under President Yoweri Museveni, the country that Winston Churchill called the "pearl of Africa" is regaining some of its allure for tourists.
While Uganda has not been without problems, including twin bombings in Kampala during the 2010 World Cup, some street clashes during political protests last year and a history of extreme antagonism toward gay people, it's still considered one of the more stable countries in sub-Saharan Africa.
The country is perhaps best known to tourists as the home of half of the world's last remaining mountain gorillas, and this year there are more opportunities to spot the elusive creatures. The Uganda Wildlife Authority recently added two gorilla families to the groups it tracks on tours in Bwindi Impenetrable Forest, a Unesco World Heritage site in southwest Uganda. Sanctuary Gorilla Forest Camp, a luxury tented camp inside the forest, is working with the Batwa Pygmy tribe, indigenous hunter-gatherers who were relocated when the park was established, to share their history and culture with guests. And Country Walkers , based in Waterbury, Vt., is offering its first safari ever in Uganda.
Beyond up-close gorilla encounters, Uganda is also the source of the Nile, boasts mountains that are among the highest in Africa -- the Mountains of the Moon in Rwenzori Mountains National Park -- and offers formidable white-water rapids for thrill seekers. MICHELLE HIGGINS
34. Ukraine
Virginal beaches and czarist palaces -- at Old World prices.
Ukraine has finally seen an influx of much-needed cash to fund its long underdeveloped tourism sector, in part thanks to its selection as host of the 2012 Union of European Football Associations European Championship. Beautiful, historic cities like Kiev, Odessa and Lviv have seen modernization, restoration and fresh cultural energy, but are still cheap, laid-back and largely free of tourist traps. All three cities have revamped their airports and added numerous hotels, restaurants and retail outlets, while new roadwork makes travel outside the city centers easier and more comfortable.
Beach lovers are well advised to head to the Black Sea coast, which extends along the Crimean Peninsula to Odessa. Long a popular beach destination for Russians, the area has slowly begun attracting a wider audience with its pristine beaches, mild climate, jutting cliffs and architectural marvels. CHARLY WILDER
35. Samana Peninsula, Dominican Republic
Unspoiled beaches, but not for long.
For years, the Samana Peninsula on the northeast coast of the Dominican Republic was one of the Caribbean's remaining natural holdouts, largely untouched because of its remote location. But an international airport, El Catey, built near the peninsula's base a few years ago and, more recently, a highway that shortened the drive from Santo Domingo to two hours from five, are bringing new development.
Balcones del Atlaantico, a RockResort that opened last May in the village of Las Terrenas, is the newest luxury resort on the peninsula. Its 86 two- and three-bedroom villas start at $500 a night, supplying a cushy base from which to explore ecotourism. The Peninsula House, a plantation-style estate with just six suites from $580 a night, was named a 2011 Grand Award winner by Andrew Harper's Hideaway Report. And Auberge Resort's' Casa Tropicalia , with 44 beachfront suites and an open-air spa on Samana Bay, is to open in 2014.
There are plenty of off-resort attractions, too. Just last month, Bravaro Runners, an adventure tour operator, opened a new zip-line tour consisting of 20 platforms and 10 zip-lines.
Go now, before the crowds arrive. MICHELLE HIGGINS
36. Dubrovnik, Croatia
The St.-Tropez of the Balkans, equal parts classic and modern.
The last five years have been good to Dubrovnik: as it has opened to Western tourists, its number of visitors has climbed steadily -- around 10 percent a year -- since the global recession hit in 2008. Often called the Jewel of the Adriatic, this seaside city features marble streets, Renaissance fountains and white sand beaches. It has also recently completed an expansion of its airport and a sleek renovation of its cable car system, offering improved city access and views.
Meanwhile, local hoteliers compete to capture the growing stream of high-end tourists, with the 17th-century Pucic Palace , the upscale Excelsior Hotel & Spa and the gorgeous clifftop Villa Dubrovnik all seeing extensive renovations in the last few years. Newer culinary draws include the French-fusion spot Gil's, the two-year-old Panorama and Lucin Kantun, a Croatian tapas restaurant that opened last year in the Old Town. CHARLY WILDER
37. Chiloe Island, Chile
A new look, and controversy, on the edge of South America.
Slide Show
Just off the west coast of Chile, where the land starts to look as if it had been broken apart by a jackhammer, Chiloe Island -- known for its stilt houses, Unesco-anointed churches , nature preserves, unusual wildlife and raw natural beauty -- is getting a facelift. Until recently, the 3,200-square-mile island was mainly a respite for locals. But President Sebastian Pinera has plans to share the island with the rest of the world.
The Chilean government has started pouring billions of pesos into the island's infrastructure and the results are already evident: new paved roads, a new ferry terminal and the soon-to-open Mocopulli Airport in the town of Castro, which will offer direct flights to Santiago. The Chilean power company Ecopower has plans to build a 56-turbine wind farm, which is expected to produce triple the island's power needs. Once construction begins, however, the island could lose many of its migratory birds, penguins and endangered blue whales, environmental groups have cautioned. In other words, the time to go is now. DANIELLE PERGAMENT
38. Jordan
New flights and a new modernist airport ease the way for visitors.
It might seem foolhardy for an airline to add a Middle East destination just as much of the Arab world is in political turmoil. But the airline is easyJet, known for its forays into unexpected markets, and the country is Jordan, which has mostly been spared the kind of protests that have toppled leaders elsewhere.
Why get on board? Starting this summer, travelers will be able to disembark at the new state-of-the-art terminal of Queen Alia airport. Designed by Sir Norman Foster using desert and Middle Eastern motifs, the building is a fitting welcome to a country that is trying to modernize while maintaining its natural beauty and traditions.
From there, head to the infinity pool of the new DoubleTree by Hilton hotel in the Red Sea resort of Aqaba. It's a soothing way to wind down after a camel expedition through the Mars-like landscape of nearby Wadi Rum, a 285-square-mile expanse of desert punctuated by wind-eroded rock formations. The region -- "vast, echoing and God-like," in the words of Lawrence of Arabia -- was named a Unesco World Heritage site last year. SETH SHERWOOD
39. Crans-Montana, Switzerland
Restaurants and luxury chalets shine a light on an Alpine resort.
Surprisingly few international tourists visit Crans-Montana, favoring better-known Alpine resorts like Zermatt and Verbier to see and be seen. But with its upmarket designer shops, five-star hotels, Michelin-starred dining and 87 miles of downhill slopes, the word is getting out.
Perched high above the Rhone Valley in western Switzerland on a sunny, south-facing plateau, the two-town resort offers panoramic views of the Matterhorn and Mont Blanc. With more than 250 boutiques, 60 restaurants and 30 hotels, Crans-Montana isn't lacking for apres-ski activities. And new flights from the charter airline Snowjet from London Stansted to Sion airport, about 19 miles from the resort, are making it easier to be on the slopes within an hour of stepping off the plane.
Abercrombie & Kent Villas, a division of the luxury tour company, has taken notice, adding the destination to its collection of luxury ski chalets this season. Weekly rental rates at one of its five 2,700-square-foot chalets, each featuring a Jacuzzi and wine cellar, start at 3,936 euros (about $5,085) for a four-bedroom.
The mountain resort is also celebrated for being the host of the Omega European Masters, among Europe's largest golf events, every September at one of the highest 18-hole golf courses in the Alps, the Severiano Ballesteros. Last year, the Crans-sur-Sierre Golf Club opened the first year-round high-altitude European golf training center so avid duffers can practice their swing despite the snow. MICHELLE HIGGINS
40. Montpellier, France
France's eighth-largest city is dressing up in designer style.
The most celebrated architect in France, Jean Nouvel, and a collaborator, Francois Fontes, introduced their blue and cube-like city hall in November, and early next year Mr. Nouvel's RBC Design Center -- another coolly modernist structure that will house the RBC brand's furniture showroom -- is to open its doors in this medieval, student-filled Mediterranean city.
Even more innovative, the long-awaited Pierres Vives Building from the star architect Zaha Hadid will be ready by year's end. A long, sprawling edifice of swirly white concrete layers and green-tinted glass, the futuristic structure will hold a library, archives and municipal offices.
And to reach them, the city is installing what may be Europe's sexiest tram system. The two existing lines sport exteriors of kaleidoscopic birds and flowers by Christian Lacroix, and two new lines with Mr. Lacroix's trademark color-soaked style are on their way. Both will make their debut this spring with an underwater design theme and a solar theme, respectively, along roughly 17 miles of new track. Think of it as France's longest fashion runway. SETH SHERWOOD
41. Nosara, Costa Rica
Surfing geeks have descended on a remote little town.
With sandy beaches, warm, jade-green waters and rolling waves that rarely get too big, the remote jungle community of Nosara on the Pacific Coast of Costa Rica has become the ideal spot to learn to surf. The crescent-shaped Guiones beach is a good jumping-off point to go hiking or visit the nearby turtle refuge, and there are small, charming hotels and local bars with live music. But in a place that sees sunny, rainless weather from December to May, surfing's the thing.
Surf schools have popped up all over town, including Surf Simply, which focuses on a technical, sports-coach philosophy and has a new guided trip option along the coast for its 2012 surf programs, and Safari Surf School , an official Billabong-certified surf camp. Nosara Surf Cam offers a real-time Web feed of the waves. Take a look and get your stoke on. BONNIE TSUI
42. South Korea
Is golf's newest hot spot in Asia?
South Korea is redefining just how luxurious golf resorts can be. A slew of new private clubs -- the kind with six-digit membership fees, designs by celebrity architects and clubhouses that look like modern art museums -- have opened recently in the country.
The most prestigious is Haesley Nine Bridges, just outside Seoul, with a clubhouse covered by a huge, sinuous web of wooden beams (it also features one of Jeff Koons's giant balloon toy sculptures).
Then there's the Ananti Club, also a commuter's distance from Seoul: 486 acres containing three courses nestled in the Yumyeongsan forest, with a clubhouse, designed by the architect Ken Min, built almost entirely underground. And the futuristic Jack Nicklaus Golf Club Korea, which opened last year in the financial center of Songdo, has a huge, undulating clubhouse designed by the California architect Mehrdad Yazdani.
In 2015, South Korea will be the host of the Presidents Cup for the first time; apparently there are some tournament-worthy courses to go with all those fancy new clubhouses. DANIELLE PERGAMENT
43. Lodz, Poland
The Hollywood of Poland reclaims its industrial past.
Poland's third-largest city and the movie-making headquarters of the country (with a film school that started the careers of Roman Polanski and Andrzej Wajda), Lodz has seen its labyrinth of textile warehouses and industrial-era relics repurposed for artistic and entrepreneurial ventures.
The latest is by the director David Lynch, who has a deal to establish a major film studio in a former 19th-century power plant in the city. Its makeover -- which will also include a planetarium, a library, an exhibition space and a theater -- is scheduled to be shown to the public in 2014. Additionally, the architect Frank Gehry, whose grandparents were from Lodz, is in talks to design a festival and congress center with an avant-garde, building-block shape.
These ventures will be in good company. One Lodz weaving mill is now a retail and entertainment center called Manufaktura, while another, Ms2, is a three-year-old contemporary art museum filled with experimental leanings. A 19th-century industrial complex has been reborn as an art incubator, Lodz Art Center, that is the host of lectures and festivals. RACHEL B. DOYLE
44. Dalarna, Sweden
A storied region offers a getaway from Stockholm.
Most travelers know Sweden only for the urban cool of Stockholm and Gothenburg. But when the sun approaches its summer apex, city dwellers often leave town for one of the country's central provinces, Dalarna. Its deep forests and glimmering lakes host traditional midsummer parties, and every brick-red farmhouse deserves its own postcard. With Dalarna's southern edge only about 125 miles from the capital, getting there -- by car, bus or rail -- is easy enough, though the rustic landscape of "the Dales," as Dalarna translates, can feel worlds apart.
That's made it a natural respite for Swedish painters like Anders Zorn, whose home in the town of Mora is now a museum. Artisans still produce traditional handicrafts like the Dala Horse, a national mascot. But Dalarna is not just for summer journeys: every March, the region hosts the Vasaloppet, one of the world's biggest cross-country ski races, and autumn brings incredible foliage and rich game dishes at restaurants of surprising sophistication like the Dala-Husby Hotell.

45. Portovenere, Italy
Stepping in while the Cinque Terre rebuilds.
Slide Show
In late October, torrential rain caused catastrophic mudslides and flooding that devastated Monterosso and Vernazza, two of the cliff-clinging, seaside villages in the famed Cinque Terre on Italy's northwestern coast.
Though the towns are slowly being rebuilt, travelers seeking the pleasures of the area in 2012 should instead consider Portovenere, an equally charming, though largely overlooked, town just south of the Cinque Terre.
Like its more famous neighbors, Portovenere is a traditional fishing village with a picturesque jumble of pastel houses, boats bobbing in the harbor and a network of meandering hiking trails. But here, crowds are sparse, so poke around the 13th-century, black-and-white striated church in peace, before marveling at the views across the glittering Bay of La Spezia, which has long inspired poets and writers, from Lord Byron to D.H. Lawrence. INGRID K. WILLIAMS

Full text: WHO said making money was supposed to be fun?
You wouldn't know it from all the fretting about the domestic economy and the European currency and financial system, but the last three months of 2011 produced the best quarter for American stocks in more than two years. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 11.2 percent.
Part of the strength was a matter of timing. The index fell 14.3 percent in the third quarter and bottomed on Oct. 3, the first trading day of the fourth. For the full year, the S.& P. 500 was essentially flat.
The late rally was also a result of American companies' remarkable ability to make decent money despite an unstable global backdrop, investment advisers say. The challenging conditions aren't expected to abate soon, and opinion differs on just how long the resilience will last. As 2012 begins, the big question for investors is whether the corporate profit picture will continue to resemble Teflon or morph into something like Krazy Glue.
"The market is in between highs and lows, and you wouldn't expect it given the news from Europe," said Brett Hammond, senior economist at TIAA-CREF. "Why we're not falling back is that earnings growth has been O.K., although not spectacular. That's keeping things from looking worse."
Mr. Hammond estimates that earnings for the S.& P. 500 companies grew 10 percent in 2011, and he expects a similar pace in the initial months of 2012. He does not envision an imminent improvement in Europe, but his outlook is rosier elsewhere.
"We can all see that Europe is going to get worse before it gets better," he said. "On the other hand, we're going to get a bit of an uptrend from Asia."
The combination of iffy economic conditions and robust corporate results pushed down interest rates on Treasury bonds and high-yield issues alike. That propped up bond mutual funds; the average one in Morningstar's database gained 2.1 percent.
Stock funds fared much better; the average portfolio that specializes in the domestic market rose 10.6 percent. The strongest sector funds focused on real estate, cyclical industries, energy and other natural resources, while technology and communications lagged. International stock funds were up 4.3 percent, as meager gains in Europe and Asia brought down the average.
James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, sees several reasons for strength in the economy and stocks to persist well into 2012.
"People aren't giving any credit to the fact that we're picking up here," he said. "Europe slowing down is a negative, but mortgage rates have dropped from about 5 percent to 4 percent. The energy bite, which was killing us early in the year, is down 20 percent." Inflation in general has eased in the last year, he added, providing "a 2 percent boost to incomes."
If the glass is at least half-full for Mr. Hammond and Mr. Paulsen, it is half-empty, or even on the verge of shattering, for others. As they see it, official Europe, in its efforts to resolve its debt crisis, is like the smoker in the old joke who has no trouble quitting -- he's done it many times.
Komal Sri-Kumar, chief global strategist at the TCW Group, counts 15 "crisis summits" in the last two years, yet "they have not achieved a lasting solution," he said. He is scornful of the half-measures he sees and contends that only "radical surgery" -- some combination of reduced debt obligations for troubled European borrowers or an engineering of higher inflation that will have the same effect by stealth -- can fix the problem once and for all.
The longer that takes to happen, the more likely that American companies' immunity will erode, in his view. He noted that about 20 percent of American exports and S.& P. 500 earnings come from Europe. What concerns him more is "financial intertwinings" between the regions.
"If a major European institution were to fail, it would cause a big hiccup in the U.S. financial system," Mr. Sri-Kumar warned. That would produce a greater impact on the economy and stock market, in his opinion, than the hit to earnings from slower European growth.
"People say, 'Europe is going to worsen and emerging markets are going to slow down, but don't worry, the U.S. will maintain its vibrancy.' " he said. "That's inconsistent. Something has to give. The next wind likely to blow is an ill wind."
David C. Wright, a manager of the Sierra Core Retirement fund, says he also expects heavy weather.
"We've had some upticks in some data series," he acknowledged, adding: "We think that's a little bit of calm before the downtrend resumes. Our view is that the biggest risk will continue to be stress from the huge global deleveraging cycle" as debt, one way or another, is wiped off the books.
As political leaders on both sides of the Atlantic seek ways to shore up their financial systems, they are hamstrung by another thorny problem: huge fiscal deficits. Investors have been relieved to hear announcements of European deficit-reduction programs, and they hope for something similar to emerge from Washington -- but they may want to be careful what they wish for.
"If there's massive austerity without offsets elsewhere, you're going to have much less economic growth in places where there is growth or a recession in places without growth," said John McDermott, lead manager of the Evercore Wealth Management Macro Opportunity fund.
That would be bad for equities, Mr. McDermott cautioned. By contrast, another round of quantitative easing, in which the Federal Reserve buys Treasury bonds or other debt instruments, would not help the deficit, but could help stocks.
Investment advisers who anticipate more problems than solutions in the months ahead see no reason for fund owners to abandon traditional havens.
"You're safer in high-grade fixed income, such as Treasury bonds and government bonds issued in Germany and Britain, as well as bonds of the most creditworthy corporate borrowers," Mr. Sri-Kumar said. "On the stock side, you want to be very defensive -- utilities, health care, consumer staples. Stay away from consumer discretionary and European equities."
Consumer discretionary industries include car manufacturing, tourism and retailing.
Mr. Wright also recommends a heavy allocation to the best bonds. As for the stock market, he said, "we expect a really difficult quarter with exceptional volatility continuing."
OTHERS have a more benign outlook for stocks. Mr. Hammond suggests a mix of sectors, including consumer staples and commodities, and "you also want to throw in some consumer durables" like carmakers, he said. As for bonds, he would throw out Treasury issues and emphasize corporate high-yield instruments.
Mr. Paulsen is vehemently negative on Treasury bonds.
"The first thing I'm worried about is bonds getting killed in the United States," he said. Treasury yields could soar "if confidence picks up and it turns out the U.S. economy is growing at 3 percent and not faltering below 2 percent."
While he says he is "leery of bonds and steady-Eddie consumer staples," Mr. Paulsen favors commodities, cyclical industries and emerging markets. He added that while better economic and financial news would help the stock market, a better mood might help more. He wants owning stocks to be fun again.
"It feels like a horrible, terrible year, but it's actually unchanged," Mr. Paulsen said, looking back at the stock market in 2011. "The biggest asset going forward could be fearcoming down."

Full text: CORRECTION APPENDED
Tokyo
DESPITE some small signs of optimism about the United States economy, unemployment is still high, and the country seems stalled.
Time and again, Americans are told to look to Japan as a warning of what the country might become if the right path is not followed, although there is intense disagreement about what that path might be. Here, for instance, is how the CNN analyst David Gergen has described Japan: "It's now a very demoralized country and it has really been set back."
But that presentation of Japan is a myth. By many measures, the Japanese economy has done very well during the so-called lost decades, which started with a stock market crash in January 1990. By some of the most important measures, it has done a lot better than the United States.
Japan has succeeded in delivering an increasingly affluent lifestyle to its people despite the financial crash. In the fullness of time, it is likely that this era will be viewed as an outstanding success story.
How can the reality and the image be so different? And can the United States learn from Japan's experience?
It is true that Japanese housing prices have never returned to the ludicrous highs they briefly touched in the wild final stage of the boom. Neither has the Tokyo stock market.
But the strength of Japan's economy and its people is evident in many ways. There are a number of facts and figures that don't quite square with Japan's image as the laughingstock of the business pages:
Japan's average life expectancy at birth grew by 4.2 years -- to 83 years from 78.8 years -- between 1989 and 2009. This means the Japanese now typically live 4.8 years longer than Americans. The progress, moreover, was achieved in spite of, rather than because of, diet. The Japanese people are eating more Western food than ever. The key driver has been better health care.
Japan has made remarkable strides in Internet infrastructure. Although as late as the mid-1990s it was ridiculed as lagging, it has now turned the tables. In a recent survey by Akamai Technologies, of the 50 cities in the world with the fastest Internet service, 38 were in Japan, compared to only 3 in the United States.
Measured from the end of 1989, the yen has risen 87 percent against the U.S. dollar and 94 percent against the British pound. It has even risen against that traditional icon of monetary rectitude, the Swiss franc.
The unemployment rate is 4.2 percent, about half of that in the United States.
According to skyscraperpage.com, a Web site that tracks major buildings around the world, 81 high-rise buildings taller than 500 feet have been constructed in Tokyo since the "lost decades" began. That compares with 64 in New York, 48 in Chicago, and 7 in Los Angeles.
Japan's current account surplus -- the widest measure of its trade -- totaled $196 billion in 2010, up more than threefold since 1989. By comparison, America's current account deficit ballooned to $471 billion from $99 billion in that time. Although in the 1990s the conventional wisdom was that as a result of China's rise Japan would be a major loser and the United States a major winner, it has not turned out that way. Japan has increased its exports to China more than 14-fold since 1989 and Chinese-Japanese bilateral trade remains in broad balance.
As longtime Japan watchers like Ivan P. Hall and Clyde V. Prestowitz Jr. point out, the fallacy of the "lost decades" story is apparent to American visitors the moment they set foot in the country. Typically starting their journeys at such potent symbols of American infrastructural decay as Kennedy or Dulles airports, they land at Japanese airports that have been extensively expanded and modernized in recent years.
William J. Holstein, a prominent Japan watcher since the early 1980s, recently visited the country for the first time in some years. "There's a dramatic gap between what one reads in the United States and what one sees on the ground in Japan," he said. "The Japanese are dressed better than Americans. They have the latest cars, including Porsches, Audis, Mercedes-Benzes and all the finest models. I have never seen so many spoiled pets. And the physical infrastructure of the country keeps improving and evolving."
Why, then, is Japan seen as a loser? On the official gross domestic product numbers, the United States has ostensibly outperformed Japan for many years. But even taking America's official numbers at face value, the difference has been far narrower than people realize. Adjusted to a per-capita basis (which is the proper way to do this) and measured since 1989, America's G.D.P. grew by an average of just 1.4 percent a year. Japan's figure meanwhile was even more anemic -- just 1 percent -- implying that it underperformed the United States by 0.4 percent a year.
A look at the underlying accounting, however, suggests that, far from underperforming, Japan may have outperformed. For a start, in a little noticed change, United States statisticians in the 1980s embarked on an increasingly aggressive use of the so-called hedonic method of adjusting for inflation, an approach that in the view of many experts artificially boosts a nation's apparent growth rate.
On the calculations of John Williams of Shadowstats.com, a Web site that tracks flaws in United States economic data, America's growth in recent decades has been overstated by as much as 2 percentage points a year. If he is even close to the truth, this factor alone may put the United States behind Japan in per-capita performance.
If the Japanese have really been hurting, the most obvious place this would show would be in slow adoption of expensive new high-tech items. Yet the Japanese are consistently among the world's earliest adopters. If anything, it is Americans who have been lagging. In cellphones, for instance, Japan leapfrogged the United States in the space of a few years in the late 1990s and it has stayed ahead ever since, with consumers moving exceptionally rapidly to ever more advanced devices.
Much of the story is qualitative rather than quantitative. An example is Japan's eating-out culture. Tokyo, according to the Michelin Guide, boasts 16 of the world's top-ranked restaurants, versus a mere 10 for the runner-up, Paris. Similarly Japan as a whole beats France in the Michelin ratings. But how do you express this in G.D.P. terms?
Similar problems arise in measuring improvements in the Japanese health care system. And how does one accurately convey the vast improvement in the general environment in Japan in the last two decades?
Luckily there is a yardstick that finesses many of these problems: electricity output, which is mainly a measure of consumer affluence and industrial activity. In the 1990s, while Japan was being widely portrayed as an outright "basket case," its rate of increase in per-capita electricity output was twice that of America, and it continued to outperform into the new century.
Part of what is going on here is Western psychology. Anyone who has followed the story long-term cannot help but notice that many Westerners actively seek to belittle Japan. Thus every policy success is automatically discounted. It is a mind-set that is much in evidence even among Tokyo-based Western diplomats and scholars.
Take, for instance, how Western observers have viewed Japan's demographics. The population is getting older because of a low birthrate, a characteristic Japan shares with many of the world's richest nations. Yet this is presented not only as a critical problem but as a policy failure. It never seems to occur to Western commentators that the Japanese both individually and collectively have chosen their demographic fate -- and have good reasons for doing so.
The story begins in the terrible winter of 1945-6, when, newly bereft of their empire, the Japanese nearly starved to death. With overseas expansion no longer an option, Japanese leaders determined as a top priority to cut the birthrate. Thereafter a culture of small families set in that has continued to the present day.
Japan's motivation is clear: food security. With only about one-third as much arable land per capita as China, Japan has long been the world's largest net food importer. While the birth control policy is the primary cause of Japan's aging demographics, the phenomenon also reflects improved health care and an increase of more than 20 years in life expectancy since 1950.
Psychology aside, a major factor in the West's comprehension problem is that virtually everyone in Tokyo benefits from the doom and gloom story. For foreign sales representatives, for instance, it has been the perfect get-out-of-jail card when they don't reach their quotas. For Japanese foundations it is the perfect excuse in politely waving away solicitations from American universities and other needy nonprofits. Ditto for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in tempering expectations of foreign aid recipients. Even American investment bankers have reasons to emphasize bad news. Most notably they profit from the so-called yen-carry trade, an arcane but powerful investment strategy in which the well informed benefit from periodic bouts of weakness in the Japanese yen.
Economic ideology has also played an unfortunate role. Many economists, particularly right-wing think-tank types, are such staunch advocates of laissez-faire that they reflexively scorn Japan's very different economic system, with its socialist medicine and ubiquitous government regulation. During the stock market bubble of the late 1980s, this mind-set abated but it came back after the crash.
Japanese trade negotiators noticed an almost magical sweetening in the mood in foreign capitals after the stock market crashed in 1990. Although previously there had been much envy of Japan abroad (and serious talk of protectionist measures), in the new circumstances American and European trade negotiators switched to feeling sorry for the "fallen giant." Nothing if not fast learners, Japanese trade negotiators have been appealing for sympathy ever since.
The strategy seems to have been particularly effective in Washington. Believing that you shouldn't kick a man when he is down, chivalrous American officials have largely given up pressing for the opening of Japan's markets. Yet the great United States trade complaints of the late 1980s -- concerning rice, financial services, cars and car components -- were never remedied.
The "fallen giant" story has also even been useful to other East Asian nations, particularly in their trade diplomacy with the United States.
A striking instance of how the story has influenced American perceptions appears in "The Next 100 Years," by the consultant George Friedman. In a chapter headed "China 2020: Paper Tiger," Mr. Friedman argues that, just as Japan "failed" in the 1990s, China will soon have its comeuppance. Talk of this sort powerfully fosters complacency and confusion in Washington in the face of a United States-China trade relationship that is already arguably the most destructive in world history and certainly the most unbalanced.
Clearly the question of what has really happened to Japan is of first-order geopolitical importance. In a stunning refutation of American conventional wisdom, Japan has not missed a beat in building an ever more sophisticated industrial base. That this is not more obvious is a tribute in part to the fact that Japanese manufacturers have graduated to making so-called producers' goods. These typically consist of advanced components or materials, or precision production equipment. They may be invisible to the consumer, yet without them the modern world literally would not exist. This sort of manufacturing, which is both highly capital-intensive and highly know-how-intensive, was virtually monopolized by the United States in the 1950s and 1960s and constituted the essence of American economic leadership.
Japan's achievement is all the more impressive for the fact that its major competitors -- Germany, South Korea, Taiwan and, of course, China -- have hardly been standing still. The world has gone through a rapid industrial revolution in the last two decades thanks to the "targeting" of manufacturing by many East Asian nations. Yet Japan's trade surpluses have risen.
Japan should be held up as a model, not an admonition. If a nation can summon the will to pull together, it can turn even the most unpromising circumstances to advantage. Here Japan's constant upgrading of its infrastructure is surely an inspiration. It is a strategy that often requires cooperation across a wide political front, but such cooperation has not been beyond the American political system in the past. The Hoover Dam, that iconic project of the Depression, required negotiations among seven states but somehow it was built -- and it provided jobs for 16,000 people in the process.

Full text: AT the turn of the last century, it was widely accepted that American stocks were virtually certain to be good long-term investments. Now, far fewer people are confident of that.
A major reason for the earlier confidence was that in the 15 years from the end of 1984 through the end of 1999, the total return of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was more than 740 percent, even after adjusting for inflation. That amounted to a compound annual real return of more than 15 percent.
At the end of 2011, by contrast, the 15-year return -- from the end of 1996 -- was just 3 percent. And most of those gains came in the first three years of the period. Since the end of 1999, the stock market has not come close to keeping up with inflation.
The first of the accompanying charts shows compound 15-year real returns on stock market investments from the period that ended in 1943 through the one that ended last month.
Broadly, it appears there is a cycle that is repeating itself, in which the 15-year return tops out at more than 15 percent and then falls precipitously.
In June 1964, the real return over the previous 15 years averaged 15.6 percent a year, the highest that figure had ever been. The stock market did not begin to fall then, but it could no longer maintain the torrid pace, and the 15-year return figures began to decline. On a real total return basis, stock prices hit their highs for the era in late 1968, and by the mid-1970s were in free fall as high inflation combined with a bear market.
By 1979, an investor who bought stocks in 1964, when the market seemed to be a sure moneymaker, had lost money after adjusting for inflation, even after including dividend income.
In the early 1980s, the stock market turned around, and by mid-1997 the 15-year return figure had reached a new high of 15.8 percent.
The second chart overlays the two cycles. The first line goes from the end of 1943 through the end of 1980, when the line was in negative territory. The second one, beginning at the end of 1980, continues through the end of last year.
The match between the lines is far from perfect, but there are significant similarities. If past is prologue, the 15-year return is likely to continue to decline and to turn negative in about four years. That does not necessarily imply that stocks will fall during that period, since that could happen with small gains over the period. And, of course, there is no assurance that history will repeat itself.
It is probably significant that opinion surveys show Americans are more pessimistic than they have been in many years. There is a fear that the American economy is in decline and that this country will be unable to compete with emerging Asian economies, principally China. There was a similar fear in the late 1970s, although then the fear was that the United States could not compete with Japan.
Perhaps overconfidence inspired in part by a strong stock market also played a role in American military history. Within a few years after the 1964 peak for 15-year returns, the United States escalated the Vietnam War. Within a few years after the 1999 peak, the United States decided to invade Iraq.
The other two charts indicate that the stock market may have done surprisingly well over the last 15 years, considering how little the economy grew over that period. Through the third quarter of last year -- the most recent data available -- real gross domestic product had risen at an annual rate of just 2.3 percent over the previous 15 years. That was the lowest return since the 15 years ending in 1960, a period that was distorted because it included the rapid decline in real gross domestic product in 1946 as the production of weapons halted after World War II.
Similarly, over the last 15 years the total real personal income earned by Americans has risen at an annual rate of just 2.6 percent. That is the lowest for any similar period for which G.D.P. data is available. Both the G.D.P. and personal income rates of growth are well below where they were when the cumulative stock returns bottomed out in 1982.
After the pessimism of the late 1970s and early 1980s, the economy and the stock market turned around as it became clear the American economy was resilient and could adapt to a changing world. The question now is whether that can happen again.

Chart Similar Cycles for Stocks: The Total Return, After Inflation, of Stocks Over 15-Year Periods Seems to Be Repeating the Pattern It Mapped Out Decades Ago. The Compound Annual Total Real Return of the Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index Peaked at More Than 15 Percent in 1999, and has Since Fallen to Just 3 Percent. That Peak Was Similar to the Earlier Peak, Reached in 1964. After That 1964 Peak, the Stock Market Lost Momentum and Then Entered a Bear Market. By 1979, the Market Had Failed to Keep Up with Inflation Over the Previous 15 Years.

Full text: CORRECTION APPENDED
Maybe it is time to start calling the glass half full.
Employers in the United States added 200,000 jobs last month, the Labor Department said Friday, a report that came on the heels of a flurry of heartening economic news and signaled gathering momentum in the recovery. Consumer confidence lifted, factories stepped up production and small businesses showed signs of life. The nation's unemployment rate fell to 8.5 percent, its lowest level in nearly three years.
It was the sixth consecutive month that the economy showed a net gain of more than 100,000 jobs -- not enough to restore employment to prerecession levels but enough, perhaps, to cheer President Obama as he enters the election year.
Mr. Obama is calculating that he can make a credible argument that he took over a country in an economic disaster and slowly walked it back.
Still, his response to the jobs report was more tempered than triumphant. "We have made real progress," Mr. Obama said during a visit to the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. "Now is not the time to stop."
He called on Congress to extend a payroll tax cut that is set to expire at the end of February.
Mr. Obama apparently does not want to repeat the mistake of overenthusiasm. In early 2010 and again in early 2011, the White House was quick to trumpet the news when the economy made moves toward recovery that turned out to be feints, going so far as to refer to the summer of 2010 as "recovery summer."
There are reasons for caution. Many economists do not expect growth in 2012 to keep up the pace of the fourth quarter of last year. Expectations are generally positive, but very modest.
And the president remains vulnerable to attack on his economic record. "This president doesn't understand how the economy works," Mitt Romney, the winner of this week's Republican caucus in Iowa, said at a campaign stop in South Carolina shortly after the jobs report was released.
But economists like Markus Schomer of PineBridge Investments now have a much rosier view than they had back in August, after a spring and summer of lost economic ground and a demoralizing political debate over the nation's debt ceiling. At that time, Mr. Schomer thought, as many did, that government dysfunction was paralyzing the economy. Now, he is ratcheting up his growth forecast for 2012.
"The improving trend in the U.S. labor markets is not just a temporary blip, but seems to be something quite sustainable," he said.
Which is not to say that there are no potential headwinds -- last year's signs of momentum were dashed by global factors like gas prices and the earthquake in Japan. "I'm a little bit concerned that Iran could be this year's Japan," Mr. Schomer said.
Among the pieces of good news in Friday's report is that the drop in the jobless rate came largely from real gains, not from discouraged workers giving up the job hunt. The new jobs were spread broadly across industries, with transportation and warehousing, retail, manufacturing and restaurants all adding jobs.
In addition, average wages on private payrolls ticked up by 4 cents an hour, though over the year wages have not kept pace with inflation. And government downsizing, which has been a drag on the jobs numbers, slowed in December, with only 12,000 public jobs lost. The private sector added 212,000 jobs.
In another positive sign, the unemployment rate seemed to be dropping at a faster rate than the number of new jobs would imply. New businesses and the newly self-employed are less likely to be counted by the Labor Department's survey of businesses, from which the job numbers are drawn, than by the department's survey of households, from which the unemployment rate is calculated. The December rate of 8.5 percent was down from a revised 8.7 percent in November.
A broader measure of unemployment, which includes people who can find only part-time work and people who have stopped looking for work, declined to 15.2 percent. A year earlier, it was 16.6 percent. Over the same period, the United States added 1.6 million jobs.
Economists continued to warn of potential dangers ahead, including the crisis in the euro zone, increased tensions with Iran which could lead to higher gas prices and the expiration of the Bush tax cuts. Congress could decline to continue extensions of the payroll tax break and unemployment benefits that have given spending a boost. Loans are still hard to obtain, and home prices have continued to fall.
Still, context is everything. The same modest upward trends that a few months ago were dismissed as far too anemic to be noticeable are now greeted with tentative praise. "People were very much thinking that the sky was falling," said Tom Porcelli, chief United States economist at RBC Capital Markets. "It's no small victory that we're up here, even with all these headwinds."
Economists suggested that the good news and consumer confidence might feed off each other, leading to further increases in spending that, they hope, will be followed by the wage increases necessary to sustain that spending.
Bullish types were quick to trumpet the American economy's resilience.
"This is the real thing," said Ian Shepherdson of High Frequency Economics. "This is finally the economy throwing off the shackles of the credit crunch."
But there is a deep hole to climb out of. There are still more than 13 million jobless Americans, 5.5 million of whom have been unemployed for half a year or more. And even those finding work are often taking salary cuts, with job creation concentrated in low-wage sectors.
"We need reports this strong and stronger for many years to come to bring our labor market back to health," said Heidi Shierholz of the Economic Policy Institute.
The report was brighter for some groups than others. Unemployment among men continued to decline, while for women it stayed flat, in part because women held a disproportionate share of the state and local government jobs that were lost, according to an analysis by the Institute for Women's Policy Research. Over all, women left the labor force, which includes job seekers as well as job holders, and men joined it. Unemployment among teenagers ticked down a bit, but more than one in five Iraq and Afghanistan veterans were unemployed, double the rate of the previous year.
Kitty Kent, 58, who lost her census job in March, got the call she had been waiting for from a temporary agency three weeks ago. She is now working part time as a receptionist. "I don't expect it to have a direct effect on me," she said of the jobs report, "but what I do expect is that the president will get a little bit of respect and perhaps more cooperation."
Hamdi Ulukaya, the chief executive of Chobani, the yogurt company, said he was building a new plant in Idaho, investing $100 million in upgrades to the company's plant in South Edmeston, N.Y., and hiring hundreds of workers. "The worst is over," Mr. Ulukaya said.
Stock markets seemed to have already factored in the news, which was foreshadowed in a report on Thursday by ADP, the payroll processing company, that showed a gain of 325,000 private sector jobs in December. ADP's reports do not always correlate with the Labor Department's findings, but they can provide additional insight. Diane Swonk, an economist with Mesirow Financial, said most of the new jobs in the ADP report were at small businesses and that generally only newer small businesses use a payroll company.
"It's one of those things where you look at that and say, 'That would be really cool if that continues,' " Ms. Swonk said. "It's not just small business -- it's new business formation."

Correction: January 10, 2012, Tuesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Saturday about job statistics for December described the data incorrectly at one point. It showed a rate of 8.5 percent for unemployment, not for employment. The article also referred incorrectly to the historical significance of high unemployment during presidential elections. Franklin D. Roosevelt was twice re-elected with a jobless rate higher than 8.5 percent; it is not the case that no sitting president has won re-election with a jobless rate that high.

Full text: HONG KONG -- Under growing pressure from the United States, some of Asia's largest economies are reluctantly looking for options to reduce the amount of oil they buy from Iran, a move that would further tighten the economic vise on an increasingly defiant nation that announced plans for a new round of naval drills in the Strait of Hormuz.
The decision by South Korea and Japan to try to accommodate Washington's demands follows reports that China has already reduced its purchase of Iranian crude in the past month in a pricing dispute with Tehran. Whatever the motives, the combined loss of sales threatens an economy already reeling, where the currency has plummeted in value, inflation has surged and the general public has expressed growing anxiety about the prospect of war.
China, Japan, India and South Korea together import more than 60 percent of Iranian oil exports, and they all depend on Iran and other Persian Gulf producers for the preponderance of their oil and natural gas needs. As tensions in the gulf have escalated and alarmed Asian governments and businesses, companies and traders from those countries have been putting out feelers to places like Russia, Vietnam, West Africa, Iraq and especially Saudi Arabia to export more oil to them, according to oil experts.
For Tehran, which relies heavily on oil revenues to prop up an economy battered by years of sanctions, the potential cutbacks by its Asian customers follow a decision by the European Union to move toward a ban on the import of Iranian oil. Taken together, the Western efforts represent the most serious economic pressure yet on Iran after years of conflict over a nuclear program that the West charges is aimed at building weapons.
But if the goal is to force Iran to relent, the campaign has so far had an opposite effect: Iranian officials have equated targeting their oil market with economic war and threatened to block the Strait of Hormuz, where about one-fifth of the world's oil passes to get to market.
The Iranian military, fresh off 10 days of naval exercises near the strait that ended this week, vowed to hold a new round of war games soon. The defense minister, Brig. Gen. Ahmad Vahidi, in comments reported by the semiofficial Fars News Agency Thursday, said the military's exercises would be "its greatest naval war games" and would occur "in the same region in the near future."
The United States, however, is keeping the pressure on.
Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner is scheduled to visit Beijing and Tokyo next week, and the tightening sanctions on Iran will be high on his agenda. United States officials said that Mr. Geithner will press China at least to resist importing more Iranian oil to replace exports that would otherwise go to Europe. The trip is part of a concerted effort by Western diplomats to persuade Asian countries to go along with new European sanctions, American and European officials say.
"It's a global chess game," said Daniel Yergin, the energy historian. "The major buyers are prudently beginning to make alternative plans to reduce their reliance on Iranian oil."
The Asian efforts to wean themselves from Iranian crude are in response to legislation enacted by Congress at the end of last year requiring the administration to phase in sanctions in stages by late June that would make it very difficult for others to buy Iranian oil, by barring transactions with Iran's central bank.
The sanctions exempt food, medicine and other humanitarian trade and include a presidential waiver for any country or company in cases in which the impact would harm the national security interests of the United States.
More significantly, the legislation exempts from sanctions countries that "significantly reduce" imports from Iran. The legislation does not define this term, leaving it to the administration, according to officials. The debate over the definition, now under way, has given the administration some leverage to entice allies like Japan, South Korea and even China to make some reductions, thus intensifying pressure, without having to take the hit of cutting off imports all at once.
But Japan and South Korea have expressed some alarm at the demand that they reduce their reliance on Iranian oil, fearing that such a move could undermine their economies. Japan, the second-largest buyer of Iranian oil, depends on Persian Gulf countries for four-fifths of its oil imports, which come through the Strait of Hormuz. Osamu Fujimura, the chief cabinet secretary, announced on Friday that Japan had expressed concern to the United States about the dangers to the Japanese and global economy from limits on Iran's oil exports.
Yasushi Kimura, the president of the JX Nippon Oil and Energy Corporation, Japan's largest refiner, announced on Thursday that his company had opened talks with Saudi Arabia and others, whom he did not name, about possible alternatives.
The South Korean government announced on Thursday that it was looking for ways to limit its imports of oil and oil products from Iran, but pointedly stopped short of suggesting that it could stop these imports altogether.
China, which imports about 11 percent of its oil from Iran, has actually reduced its daily purchases of Iranian crude, although estimates of the cutback range from as little as 15,000 barrels a day, or 3 percent of Chinese imports from Iran, to considerably more than that. It was hard to know if Beijing was making a political statement or merely trying to buy the oil on better terms.
"The Chinese have definitely cut back on long-term contracts, but we don't know exactly why," said Andy Lipow, a Houston refining and trading analyst. "They may feel they will be able to buy cheaper on short-term markets if Iran were to lose its European customers."
Saudi Arabia has repeatedly said it would increase production if needed to make up for any decline in exports from Iran, its longtime regional rival.
"Saudi Arabia and OPEC have always delivered what the market required," said Sadad Ibrahim Al-Husseini, former head of exploration and production at Saudi Aramco, the Saudi state oil company. "There is enough supply from other OPEC countries" to compensate for losses of Iranian supplies, he added.
Mr. Husseini stressed that Middle Eastern oil markets were not yet in crisis mode, noting that insurance rates on tankers had not yet gone up in part because a tightening of European sanctions is at least a month away and a blockade of the strait is considered unlikely. "The market is still comfortable Iran cannot pull off its threats," he said.
But oil analysts have warned that the international oil market remains tight, even with Libyan oil quickly coming back on line. Any disruption in the Middle East would probably bring a sharp increase in prices, which would put the shaky world economic recovery at risk, they say.
A senior government official in the Persian Gulf said Arab countries in the region were not panicking about the latest Iranian threats, while at the same time, encouraging the United States "to take a firm stand."
"The last thing we want is some kind of military intervention," said the official, who was granted anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly for his government. "But it should be left on the table."
The Chinese Foreign Ministry took a cautious position this week on Iran, reiterating China's broad objection to all sanctions that have not been approved by the United Nations and expressing hope that no military action of any sort will take place.
"We hope to maintain peace and stability in the gulf region," said Hong Lei, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, at a regularly scheduled news conference on Wednesday.
But China is worried about the flow of oil through the Strait of Hormuz, said Patrick Ho, the chief executive and secretary general of the China Energy Fund Committee, an influential group in Hong Kong and Beijing with links to the Chinese government. "It is the lifeline as far as energy is concerned for China," Mr. Ho said.

Full text: For the first time in many years, manufacturing stands out as an area of strength in the American economy.
When the Labor Department reports December employment numbers on Friday, it is expected that manufacturing companies will have added jobs in two consecutive years. Until last year, there had not been a single year when manufacturing employment rose since 1997.
And this week the Institute for Supply Management, which has been surveying American manufacturers since 1948, reported that its employment index for December was 55.1, the highest reading since June. Any number above 50 indicates that more companies say they are hiring than say they are reducing employment.
There were new signs Thursday that the overall jobs climate was improving, as the Labor Department reported that new claims for unemployment benefits fell last week and a payroll company's report showed strong growth in private-sector jobs in December.
As stores have filled with inexpensive imports from China and other Asian countries, the perception has risen that the United States no longer makes much of anything. Certainly there has been a long decline in manufacturing employment, which peaked in 1979 at 19.6 million workers. Now even with hiring over the last two years, the figure is 11.8 million, a decline of 40 percent from the high.
But those numbers obscure the fact that the United States remains a manufacturing power, albeit one that has been forced to specialize in higher-value items because its labor costs are far above those in Asia. The value of American manufactured exports over a 12-month period peaked at $1.095 trillion in the summer of 2008, just before the credit crisis caused world trade volumes to plunge. At the low, the 12-month figure fell below $800 billion, but it has since climbed back to $1.074 trillion. Those figures are not adjusted for inflation.
In total exports, including manufactured goods as well as other commodities like agricultural products, the United States ranked second in the world in 2010, behind China but just ahead of Germany. For the first 10 months of 2011, Germany is slightly ahead of the United States.
The United States is particularly strong in machinery, chemicals and transportation equipment, which together make up nearly half of the exports. Exports of computers and electronic products are growing, but are well below their precrisis levels. Production of cheaper computers and parts shifted to Asia long ago.
Just how long the rise in manufactured exports can last depends, in part, on the health of other economies. The euro zone no longer takes as large a share of American exports as it once did, but it is still a major customer. A recession there this year, as has been widely forecast, would hurt all major exporters, including the United States.
Similarly, the strong exports provide a stark reminder of how vulnerable this country could be to protectionist trade wars. The Doha round of world trade talks, which was supposed to result in the lowering of more trade barriers, has stalled. And last month China imposed punitive duties on imports of American large cars and sport utility vehicles, which total about $4 billion a year.
That move was seen as retaliation for United States requests that the World Trade Organization rule that Chinese subsidies for its solar and poultry industries violated international law. The Chinese denounced those requests as protectionist.
The American government denies that, of course. "Part of a foundation of a rules-based system is dispute settlement," said Ron Kirk, the United States trade representative, in an interview with Reuters after the Chinese announced the new tariffs. "That's what we think is so important about the W.T.O. How China reacts to that is up to China. But I just cannot buy into the argument that our standing and protecting the rights of our exporters and workers is somehow igniting a trade war or being protectionist."
Since employment in the United States hit its recent low, in February 2010, the economy has added 2.4 million jobs through November, of which 302,000 were in manufacturing. With government payrolls shrinking, and financial services jobs also fewer, manufacturing employment has played an important role in keeping the economy growing. It also is helping that construction employment appears to have hit bottom. In the first 11 months of 2011, it is up a small amount.
To be sure, the gains in manufacturing employment and exports have come after sharp declines during the recession and credit crisis. There are still 6 percent fewer manufacturing jobs than there were when President Obama took office at the beginning of 2009, and it seems very unlikely that he will be the first president since Bill Clinton, in his first term, to preside over growing manufacturing employment during a four-year term.
During George W. Bush's two terms, the number of manufacturing jobs fell by 17 percent in the first four years and by 12 percent in the following four years. The number declined by 1 percent in Mr. Clinton's second term.
The Institute for Supply Management survey of manufacturers has shown more companies planning to hire than to fire in every month since October 2009. That string of 27 months is the longest such string since 1972, but remains well behind the longest one, 36 months, which ended in December 1966.
Over all, that survey has indicated that a plurality of companies has believed business is getting better for 29 consecutive months, and December's reading of 53.9 was the strongest since June.
This summer, one widely watched part of the Institute for Supply Management survey showed that a small plurality of companies reported new orders were falling, a fact that helped to stimulate talk of a double-dip recession. But the latest reading, of 57.6, indicates widespread strength in new orders.
In an economy where there is widespread concern over consumer spending, and in which government spending and payrolls are under heavy pressure, manufacturing has become a bright spot. It is not enough to produce a strong rebound, and it remains vulnerable to weakness overseas. But it has helped to keep a weak economic recovery from turning into a new recession.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve will begin later this month to publish the predictions of its senior officials about their own decisions, hoping to increase its influence over economic activity by guiding investor expectations.
The change was approved at the most recent meeting of the Fed's policy-making committee, in December, but was kept secret until Tuesday afternoon, when the Fed released an account of the meeting after a standard three-week delay.
The inaugural forecast, set for Jan. 25, will show the range of predictions made by Fed officials about the level of short-term interest rates in the fourth quarter of 2012, 2013 and 2014, although it will not list individual predictions.
It also will summarize when they expect to start raising short-term rates, which they have held near zero since late 2008. And it will describe their plans for the Fed's investment portfolio.
The forecast could reduce borrowing costs for businesses and consumers by convincing investors that the Fed intends to keep rates near zero for longer than expected. But the benefits most likely would be modest, as rates already are very low and already are widely expected to remain near zero into 2014.
A more significant possibility, is that the changes will set the stage for the Fed to announce an expansion of its existing economic aid campaign, for example, by once again increasing its purchases of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities.
According to the meeting minutes, "a number of members" of the 10-person committee "indicated that current and prospective economic conditions could well warrant additional policy accommodation, but they believed that any additional actions would be more effective if accompanied by enhanced communication."
This, however, is unlikely to have any broad impact on the economy, because the Fed lacks the power to address the most important issues weighing on growth, including a lack of demand from gloomy consumers, high levels of debt throughout the economy and the depressed condition of the housing market. Stock traders took the Fed's announcement in stride as indexes continued their rise in the first day of trading in 2012.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed up 1.6 percent. The Fed's staff, which prepares an economic forecast noted for its unusual accuracy in an uncertain business, reduced its medium-term outlook for growth, citing the impact of events in Europe, according to the minutes.
"The Fed's core problem right now is that the parts of the economy through which those interest rate effects would normally get traction are blocked," said Vincent Reinhart, chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley and a former senior Fed staff official. "It is not clear how effective any of these policies will be."
The change in communications policy is part of a broader effort by the Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, to improve public understanding of the central bank's goals and methodology. It formalizes a series of experiments with forecasting that the Fed has made in recent years, beginning with its statement in December 2008 that rates would remain near zero "for some time."
Talking about future policy was a longstanding taboo among central bankers, who worried that investors would treat the predictions as promises and react badly when some predictions inevitably were off base. But the Fed now is casting its lot with the growing camp that regards shaping expectations as a primary tool for monetary policy, and is eager to seize any opportunity.
The forecast will summarize the predictions of the Fed's five governors -- two seats on the board are vacant -- and the 12 presidents of its regional banks, only five of whom hold votes on the committee at a given time. It will be included in an existing forecast of economic conditions -- the rates of growth, inflation and unemployment -- that the Fed publishes four times a year.
In presenting those forecasts, the Fed excludes the three highest and the three lowest estimates submitted by the officials. It then reports the highest and lowest predictions among the remaining 11 forecasts, showing a range that it describes as the "central tendency."
For example, the forecast published in November, showed the committee expected growth of 2.5 percent to 2.9 percent in 2012.
The Fed also will publish what it described as "qualitative information" regarding the committee's expectations about the management of the Fed's balance sheet.
The Fed's plans for buying or selling assets are, at present, of even greater interest to most investors than the path of short-term interest rates.
Support for the changes was not unanimous, according to the minutes, which said that some "did not see providing policy projections as a useful step at this time." But no formal vote was recorded. Instead, the minutes reflect that the participants -- not just the 10 members with votes -- reached a consensus.

Abstract: [...] the purpose of the minimum wage -- to reward work, reduce poverty and help ensure that economic growth is broadly shared -- would be better met if the federal government was again the standard setter.

Full text: On Sunday, Washington became the first state to have a minimum wage above $9 an hour, $9.04 to be exact. Seven other states also had increases on New Year's Day because they, too, adjust their minimum wages to keep pace with rising costs. In Oregon, the hourly minimum rose to $8.80; in Colorado to $7.64, with the wages in Arizona, Florida, Montana, Ohio and Vermont in between.
The federal minimum wage, however, remains stuck at $7.25 an hour. It has been so since 2009, and will stay there until Congress passes a law to lift it. Such raises are too few and far between; there have been only nine legislated increases since the first minimum wage -- .25 cents an hour -- was enacted in 1938.
Worse, the real value of the wage peaked in 1968, at a level that is roughly equivalent to $9.85 in 2011 dollars, and it has declined by more than 25 percent since then. States like Washington that protect their workers this way are to be commended. But the purpose of the minimum wage -- to reward work, reduce poverty and help ensure that economic growth is broadly shared -- would be better met if the federal government was again the standard setter. For a minimum wage to combat income inequality, it must apply to a large section of the labor force.
During the 2008 campaign, President Obama called for a minimum wage of $9.50 an hour, indexed to inflation. It is time to keep that promise, making a higher minimum wage part of any jobs agenda.
Republicans will inevitably complain that a higher wage will be a "job killer." Studies have not been able to determine definitively whether the employment impact of a higher wage is positive or negative, just that it is small. Researchers at the Economic Policy Institute have shown that the increase in wages from a higher minimum is greater than any wage decreases because of fewer hours worked. At a time of increasing inequality, America's low-wage workers need a raise.

Full text: BELIEVE it or not, times are getting better.
At least that's what the dry statistics keep telling us. Industrial production, G.D.P. -- the kind of figures that Washington and Wall Street sweat over -- suggest that the economy is on the mend.
Yet if we go beyond the Beltway and the Battery, to where most of American life is lived, the numbers don't always add up. Yes, the Great Recession officially ended in 2009. But many millions of Americans are out of work or cannot find full-time jobs. Home prices are wobbly. The foreclosure crisis drags on. And the Occupy movement's campaign against "the 1 percent" has underscored the ravages of income inequality.
It was, as always, a year of ups and downs in business. Washington said the nation's AAA rating was safe, but Standard & Poor's concluded that it wasn't. Europe insisted that its currency was sound, but investors worry that it isn't. Wall Street seemed perpetually on edge. After so many wild days, the American stock market ended 2011 about where it began.
On this side of the Atlantic, aftershocks of the financial crisis of 2008-9 are still reverberating, though the worst has passed. Now, how Europe's economic troubles play out may determine whether job growth here finally picks up enough to make up for all the lost ground -- and whether that 401(k) is richer or poorer next Jan. 1.
Where to go from here? And how to face the challenges ahead? Sunday Business asked the six economists who write the Economic View column to do a little blue-sky thinking on issues as varied as the Fed, Europe and housing. You won't find stock tips. But if 2011 was any guide, the best advice for 2012 may be this: Hold tight.
Dear Mr. Bernanke:
Please Tell Us More
N. GREGORY MANKIW A professor of economics at Harvard, he is advising Mitt Romney in the campaign for the Republican presidential nomination.
WHAT can we do to get this economy going?
That's the question Ben Bernanke and his colleagues at the Federal Reserve must be asking. Officially, the recession ended a while ago. But with unemployment lingering above 8 percent, it still feels as if we're mired in a slump.
The Fed's typical response to lackluster growth is to reduce short-term interest rates. To its credit, it did that -- quickly and drastically -- as the recession unfolded in 2007 and 2008. Then it took various unconventional steps to push down long-term rates, including those on mortgages. Mr. Bernanke deserves more credit than anyone for preventing the financial crisis from turning into a second Great Depression.
Now, the key will be managing expectations. Financial markets always look ahead, albeit imperfectly. They not only care what the Fed does today but also about what it will do tomorrow. With official short-term rates already near zero, what the Fed does this year will be less important than what policy makers say they will do next year -- or the year after that.
A crucial question is how quickly the Fed will raise interest rates as the economy recovers. So far, Fed policy makers have said they expect to keep rates "exceptionally low" at least until mid-2013. There has even been talk about extending that time frame by a year, to mid-2014.
But Charles I. Plosser, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, was right when he said recently that "policy needs to be contingent on the economy, not the calendar." The key to managing expectations will be spelling out this contingency plan in more detail. That is, what does the Fed need to see before it starts raising rates again?
Unfortunately, economists don't offer simple and unequivocal advice. Some suggest watching the overall inflation rate. Others say to watch inflation, but to exclude volatile food and energy prices. And still others advise targeting nominal gross domestic product, which weights inflation and economic growth equally.
Forging a consensus among members of Federal Open Market Committee, which sets monetary policy, won't be easy. In fact, it may well be impossible. But the more clarity the Fed offers about its contingency plans, the better off we'll all be in the years ahead.
Two Big Problems,
Two Ready Solutions
CHRISTINA D. ROMER An economics professor at the University of California, Berkeley, she was chairwoman of President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers.
THE United States faces two daunting economic problems: an unsustainable long-run budget deficit and persistent high unemployment. Both demand aggressive action in the form of fiscal policy.
Waiting until after the November elections, as seems likely, would be irresponsible. It is also unnecessary, since there are plans to address both problems that should command bipartisan support.
On the deficit, the big worry isn't the current shortfall, which is projected to decline sharply as the economy recovers. Rather, it's the long-run outlook. Over the next 20 to 30 years, rising health care costs and the retirement of the baby boomers are projected to cause deficits that make the current one look puny. At the rate we're going, the United States would almost surely default on its debt one day. And like the costs of maintaining a home, the costs of dealing with our budget problems will only grow if we wait.
We already have a blueprint for a bipartisan solution. The Bowles-Simpson Commission hashed out a sensible plan of spending cuts, entitlement program reforms and revenue increases that would shave $4 trillion off the deficit over the next decade. It shares the pain of needed deficit reduction, while protecting the most vulnerable and maintaining investments in our future productivity. Congress should take up the commission's recommendation the first day it returns in January.
But we can't focus on the deficit alone. Persistent unemployment is destroying the lives and wasting the talents of more than 13 million Americans. Worse, the longer that people remain out of work, the more likely they are to suffer a permanent loss of skills and withdraw from the labor force.
Despite heated rhetoric to the contrary, the evidence that fiscal stimulus raises employment and lowers joblessness is stronger than ever. And pairing additional strong stimulus with a plan to reduce the deficit would likely pack a particularly powerful punch for confidence and spending.
The payroll tax cut for workers and employers and the extended unemployment insurance that President Obama proposed last September would help put people back to work.
But even better would be measures that increase employment today, while also leaving us with something of lasting value. Because many people worry about increasing the role of the federal government, why not give substantial federal funds to state and local governments for public investment? Tell them that the money has to be used for either physical infrastructure like roads, bridges and airports, or for human infrastructure like education, job training and scientific research. Then let the states, cities and towns figure out what would work best for their citizens.
Ronald Reagan once said that "there are simple answers -- there just are not easy ones." What needs to happen on fiscal policy is relatively straightforward. The hard part is getting politicians to do it.
Thickening Clouds

Over Europe
TYLER COWEN A professor of economics at George Mason University.

HOW, and when, will Europe get out of its mess?
The short answer is this: not anytime soon, and not without more pain. The longer that Europe's troubles last, the worse and more insidious they become. Insolvent governments, troubled banks, divisive politics, painful austerity -- the list of problems is formidable already.
The best-case outlook is that the euro zone will, in effect, grow its way out of this crisis. The European Central Bank is now extending unlimited loans to banks in the 17 nations of the European Union that use the euro, provided that those banks put up collateral. The loans don't have to be paid back for three years, by which time it is hoped that steady growth will have returned.
In theory, these loans should ensure that Europe's banks stay liquid. Some of these banks, in turn, are already lending money to their national governments, and others may be forced to. In the short run, this will help keep euro zone governments funded, too.
If the economy starts growing again before the loans are due, the central bank's efforts to fix the Continent's solvency problems will have succeeded. The plan will have relieved pressure in the money markets and on the banks, since they would be backed by wealthier, more credible governments. We would probably have to write off Greece, but, under this circumstance, other euro zone countries would avoid a major financial crisis.
There are, however, several darker possibilities. One is that the economies of some major euro zone nations will continue to stagnate. In per-capita terms, Italy is already poorer than it was 12 years ago, so maybe it's stuck in a slow-growth mode. If that's the case, more borrowing from the European Central Bank is simply stretching an unsustainable situation.
Eventually, the central bank would have to let it be known that it is not expecting its money back. In this case, banks in weak nations would probably be unable to raise funds from the private sector. Confidence would evaporate. Some countries would end up abandoning the euro and printing their own currency to keep their promises to bank depositors and bondholders. The consequences could be disastrous, not only for Europe, but for the global economy.
A second danger would arise in Europe if an election, probably in a smaller country, gave rise to a government that repudiated the euro. Then, too, all bets would be off.
My guess -- and guess is the right word -- is that odds of this ending well are about one in three. Otherwise, fasten your seat belts.
Why 2 Paychecks
Are Barely Enough
ROBERT H. FRANKAn economics professor at the Johnson Graduate School of Management at Cornell University.

WHY do many middle-class families now struggle to get by on two paychecks, whereas most got by on just one back in the 1950s and '60s?
The answer, according to "The Two-Income Trap," by Elizabeth Warren and Amelia Warren Tyagi, is that many second paychecks today go toward financing a largely fruitless bidding war for homes in good school districts.
Parents naturally want to send their kids to good schools. But quality is relative. Because the best schools tend to be those serving expensive neighborhoods, parents must outbid 50 percent of other parents with the same goal just to send their children to a school of average quality.
How hard is that? I constructed a measure I call the toil index. It tracks the number of hours a median earner must work each month to earn the implicit rent for the median-priced house.
From 1950 to 1970, when incomes were growing at about the same rate for families up and down the income ladder, the toil index actually declined slightly. But since 1970 -- a period during which income inequality has grown -- the toil index has risen sharply.
The increase in two-earner households explains only part of it. The climb in the toil index was also driven by the easy credit that fueled the housing bubble, as well as by an expenditure cascade in housing caused by growing income disparities.
Since 1970, the top 1 percent have captured most of the income growth in the nation. Like everyone else, the rich spend more on housing when they have more money. High-end houses become bigger and fancier. That shifts the frame of reference for the near rich, and so on down the income ladder. Because the median hourly wage, adjusted for inflation, has been falling, there's really no other way to explain why the median new house built in the United States in 2007 was about 50 percent larger than its counterpart in 1970.
The increase in the toil index has been spectacular. From a postwar low of 41 hours a month in 1970, it rose to more than 100 hours in 2005. Although it has fallen since the housing bubble burst, the middle-class squeeze persists.
Growing income disparities don't just make the 99 percent angry. They also raise the cost of achieving basic goals.
A Tax Credit to Fix
A Housing Mess
ROBERT J. SHILLERA professor of economics and finance at Yale.
WE used to talk a lot about helping homeowners in trouble.
Instead, the bankers were bailed out -- and now we hardly talk at all about aiding ordinary Americans.
Yet the problems facing homeowners today are even bigger than they were in the dark days of the financial crisis. According to the S.& P./Case-Shiller 20-city Home Price Index, home prices have fallen 13.2 percent since Lehman Brothers collapsed in September 2008. Over the same period, of course, unemployment has climbed.
In other words, more homeowners are underwater on their mortgages -- and more Americans are out of work. And home prices are still falling.
So we need to overcome the sense that real help is impossible -- and to think about approaches that might be politically feasible. Despite concern over our national debt and a general distaste for spending taxpayer dollars on people who may have been less responsible, there are some potential solutions.
Prof. Richard K. Green, director of the Lusk Center for Real Estate at the University of Southern California, has proposed changing the tax system so that it offers stronger, more targeted encouragement for homeownership by focusing on people who might be giving up the dream of buying any home at all. The current mortgage interest deduction, Professor Green argues, based on his work with Prof. Andrew Reschovsky of the University of Wisconsin, is mostly an incentive for relatively wealthy people to build bigger houses, rather than for people of modest means to buy a home. It also provides a strong incentive only for people in high tax brackets, who benefit more because of their higher marginal tax rates, and who tend to itemize because the standard deduction is less advantageous for them.
Professor Green wants to offer more help for lower-income taxpayers. He suggests creating a refundable tax credit as a percentage of mortgage interest payments, one that could be used even by those who take the standard deduction. This credit, presumably with some dollar limit, would be available to all homeowners. (That is in contrast to the HARP 2.0 mortgage refinancing program from the Obama administration; it is available, arbitrarily, only to those with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac mortgages.) Professor Green proposes paying for this change by gradually phasing out the existing mortgage interest deduction.
Homeownership fosters citizenship, builds stronger families and communities, encourages active participation in the economy and, ultimately, bolsters economic confidence. Professor Green's proposal is an example of a change that wouldn't smack of a bailout, but would help vulnerable people who are losing hope in the American Dream.
The Answer Starts
With a Salad Bar
RICHARD H. THALER A professor of economics and behavioral science at the Booth School of Business at the University of Chicago.

IN case you've forgotten, we have a crisis in health care spending. But employers can help us deal with it -- and save themselves some money -- with a few nudges.
The thesis of "Nudge," which Cass R. Sunstein and I wrote in 2008, is that "choice architects" can often help people achieve their goals simply by making the necessary steps easier. As choice architects, employers can do a lot to improve their workers' health. That, in turn, can lead to more productive workers who have fewer sick days and cost less to insure.
Where to start? First, make it easier to eat well while at work. That doesn't mean limiting the cafeteria menu to tofu and cauliflower. It means offering various healthful, tasty options that are featured prominently. Put an attractive salad bar including some healthy proteins before the burger line, for instance, and subsidize the healthy food.
Second, make it easier to get some exercise during the workday. Walking just 30 minutes a day provides noticeable health benefits. Some ambitious companies have installed treadmills with workstations, but there are lower-cost solutions. Even a small to midsize business can probably arrange a discount at a health club.
You don't have to leave work to get some exercise. A good place to start is on the stairs. Walking a few flights several times a day is a good start on that 30 minutes. To entice workers, companies should make their stairwells attractive and fun. Add music, murals or graffiti contests. Or try lotteries with a chance to win any time you walk up or down one flight. Finally, better align health insurance incentives with behavior. One of the biggest health care problems is that patients don't keep up with their medications, even those that might save their lives. Why charge people who've had heart attacks a co-payment when they fill prescriptions that reduce the chance of another attack? Instead, make those prescriptions free and use technology to remind them to take their medicine, either with a text message or a pillbox that starts beeping if you forget to take your pills.
And here's a practice we should use more often: Offer insurance discounts to reward healthy behavior. Saving $500 on a premium is a good incentive to quit smoking or lose some weight.
My New Year's resolution is to take at least two walking meetings a week. How about you?

Full text: Washington
THE Egyptian revolution did not happen last winter. It is happening now. And it is not taking place in Tahrir Square, but in towns and villages throughout the country.
Although protests and violent military responses in central Cairo have seized world attention, they involve only a small fraction of Egyptians. Much more important are the millions who voted this month in a rolling election process that will continue into January, setting the stage for a negotiation between newly elected officials and Egypt's military rulers over the country's political future. We must focus our attention on its outcome and, perhaps counterintuitively, try to ensure an ambiguous result so that no side is left empty-handed.
In February, the picture looked very different. The youthful energy of Egypt's revolutionaries captivated audiences and furthered the view that educated and tolerant people across the region were poised to seize power from brutal dictators. As the Arab Spring wore on, it became clear that not as much had changed in Egypt as many had thought. Army officers in suits had ruled Egypt since the 1950s. They were still in command, albeit now in uniform. Many Egyptians bristled, and thousands protested the army's ongoing rule and the slow pace of reform.
A core of activists still come to Tahrir Square, but the real game is farther afield, where Islamist parties have mobilized tens of thousands to get out the vote and monitor polling stations.
For Americans, it is hard to imagine that religious parties could win almost 70 percent of the Egyptian vote. But I served as an official election observer earlier this month, and it is hard for me to imagine how they could not. Islamists have grasped that the game has moved beyond protests to the mechanics of elections, and their supporters are motivated, organized and energetic. By contrast, the secular liberal parties are virtually absent from the countryside. Judging from posters, billboards, bumper stickers and banners, the two major Islamist parties have the field almost to themselves.
Although Egypt's rising Islamist politicians are seeking to take power from the military, the army has generally supported the political process by guarding polling stations and maintaining order. But the army's legitimacy is now fading due to its brutal treatment of protesters. While it had initially approached the elections with professionalism and fairness, raids on civil society and democracy groups in recent days represent a real departure. As the army's image declines, high voter turnout and strong poll results are enhancing Islamists' legitimacy.
This is but a prelude to the real battle, which will come in the spring as a new Parliament is seated, constitutional revisions begin and a presidential election campaign kicks off. Egypt is also likely to be running low on foreign exchange reserves, tempting the government to devalue the pound and spur inflation.
Elected politicians and the army will both be working to set the rules by which Egypt will be governed. Each side is likely to take things to the brink, reminding the other of its strengths and ensuring that it gets the best deal.
Many in Israel and America, and even some in Egypt, fear that the elections will produce an Islamist-led government that will tear up the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty, turn hostile to the United States, openly support Hamas and transform Egypt into a theocracy that oppresses women, Christians and secular Muslims. They see little prospect for more liberal voices to prevail, and view military dictatorship as a preferable outcome.
American interests, however, call for a different outcome, one that finds a balance -- however uneasy -- between the military authorities and Egypt's new politicians. We do not want any one side to vanquish or silence the other. And with lopsided early election results, it is especially important that the outcome not drive away Egypt's educated liberal elite, whose economic connections and know-how will be vital for attracting investment and creating jobs.
Our instinct is to search for the clarity we saw in last winter's televised celebrations. However, what Egyptians, and Americans, need is something murkier -- not a victory, but an accommodation.

Full text: After they took power in January, the hard-line Republicans who dominate the House reached for a radical overhaul of American government, hoping to unravel the social safety net, cut taxes further for the wealthy and strip away regulation of business. Fortunately, thanks to defensive tactics by Democrats, they failed to achieve most of their agenda.
But they still did significant damage in 2011 to many of the most important functions of government, and particularly to investments in education, training and transportation that the country will need for a sound economic recovery.
With a threatened government shutdown in April, the Republicans pushed through spending cuts of about $25 billion over a decade. Then, in August, the agreement to raise the debt ceiling -- an unnecessary crisis created by the Republicans -- cut nearly $2 trillion through 2021 with strict spending caps, a move that will hurt hundreds of programs serving millions of Americans for a full decade and longer.
Given the level of extortion they faced, the White House budget office and Congressional Democrats negotiated relatively well. They prevented Republicans from touching Medicare recipients, Medicaid, Social Security and other programs. (President Obama did offer to cut entitlement spending in exchange for higher tax revenues, but Republicans refused that deal.) They arranged for more than $500 billion in cuts to come from defense spending. And they did not agree to extend the Bush tax cuts, now scheduled to expire at the end of 2012.
But that still leaves major reductions in the vital category known as nondefense discretionary spending, which faces cuts of around $800 billion over a decade. That category includes education, housing assistance, transportation, public health, veterans benefits, law enforcement and courts, environmental protection and many other crucial programs.
This spending category has been the main focus of Republican pressure for decades. In the 1970s, nondefense discretionary spending represented about 5 percent of the gross domestic product; that is now down to about 2.5 percent. Over the next decade, once the new cuts go into effect, it will decline to less than 2 percent. This year's spending bill, signed into law a few days ago, is roughly 10 percent lower than last year's, cutting Pell grants, environmental programs and aid to desperate states. Low-income heating assistance was cut by 25 percent.
As the economist Jared Bernstein has noted, this is the category of spending that helps people move up the income ladder, providing nutritious food, improving early education and job training and putting people to work.
The precise cuts on individual programs will be determined each year by appropriators acting under the new caps. Each year's cuts will be more painful than the last because the spending limits fail to keep pace with population growth, inflation and the needs of the economy.
This situation is the result of the Republicans' success at shifting Washington's focus from job creation and revenue increases to deficit reduction, at exactly the wrong time, when the economy was too weak to handle it.
The long-term deficit needs to be reduced once economic growth has returned, but only in the context of higher taxes for the rich and a careful restructuring of Medicare. Even if the Bush tax cuts expire on time, much of the $3.8 trillion that that would bring in over a decade would have to be used for deficit reduction if the caps stay in place.
All of this leaves President Obama and the Democrats with much work to do in 2012. When the 2013 budget process begins in a few weeks, they will need to protect vital investments from further cuts and start building the case for raising the spending caps.

Full text: KAROO, South Africa -- When a drought dried up their wells last year, hundreds of farmers and their families flocked to local fairgrounds here to pray for rain, and a call went out on the regional radio station imploring South Africans to donate bottled water.
Covering much of the roughly 800 miles between Johannesburg and Cape Town, this arid expanse -- its name means "thirsty land" -- sees less rain in some parts than the Mojave Desert.
Even so, Shell and several other large energy companies hope to drill thousands of natural gas wells in the region, using a new drilling technology that can require a million gallons of water or more for each well. Companies will also have to find a way to dispose of all the toxic wastewater or sludge that each well produces, since the closest landfill or industrial-waste facility that can handle the waste is hundreds of miles away.
"Around here, the rain comes on legs," said Chris Hayward, 51, a brawny, dust-covered farmer in Beaufort West, quoting a Karoo saying about how rare and fleeting precipitation is in the area.
With his three skinny border collies crouching dutifully at his side, Mr. Hayward explained that he had to slaughter more than 600 of his 2,000 sheep last year because there was not enough water to go around.
"If our government lets these companies touch even a drop of our water," he said, "we're ruined."
South Africa is among the growing number of countries that want to unlock previously inaccessible natural gas reserves trapped in shale deep underground. The drilling technology -- hydraulic fracturing, or "fracking," for short -- holds the promise of generating new revenue through taxes on the gas, creating thousands of jobs for one of the country's poorest regions, and fueling power plants to provide electricity to roughly 10 million South Africans who live without it.
But many of the sites here and on other continents that are being considered for drilling by oil and gas companies and by governments short of cash are in fragile areas where local officials have limited resources, political leverage or experience to ensure that the drilling is done safely.
A Surge in Interest
The interest from big energy companies in South Africa and elsewhere means that shale gas may redraw the global energy map, according to many energy experts.
Michael Klare, a professor of world security studies at Hampshire College, said that the new sources of natural gas from shale may lessen the geopolitical importance of countries that historically have been the biggest producers of natural gas, including Iran, Qatar and Russia. The new drilling, which draws strong support from the United States government, represents a boon for American companies like Halliburton, Chesapeake Energy and Exxon Mobil that have greater experience with shale gas, and therefore are likely to win many lucrative contracts abroad.
More than 30 countries, including China, India and Pakistan, are now considering fracking for natural gas or oil, and the surge in gas production has spurred interest in building pipelines and terminals that liquefy the fuel so it can be shipped to far-flung markets. In the United States, shale gas has increased supply, driving prices down and benefiting industrial plants that use the gas for manufacturing and consumers who depend on it for electricity, heating or cooking.
But the enthusiasm abroad, especially in less-developed regions, does carry risks, according to many energy experts.
"The big problem is that all the excitement around shale gas, most of it fostered by the U.S., has also led some countries, especially in the developing world, to take a drill-first, figure-out-regulations-later attitude," said Professor Klare, who has written extensively about the way that energy policies affect global security. "There is simply too much being taken on faith when it comes to company reassurances about the safety and costs of this drilling."
The Indonesian government, for example, is considering allowing drilling for shale gas in a part of Java where, in 2006, drilling led to the eruption of a mud volcano that killed at least 13 people, and displaced more than 30,000 residents from 12 villages, according to a team of international scientists. Indonesia is a major exporter of liquefied natural gas, but it struggles to meet domestic demand, and supporters of the shale drilling project say it will help solve that problem.
Shale gas in Poland may represent more than a third of the natural gas resources in Europe, according to energy experts, and could help the country reduce its dependence on Russia, which now supplies about 60 percent of Poland's gas.
But an April 2010 report by Bernstein Research, a market research group, raised concerns about the costs and risks of shale gas drilling because Poland is so densely populated, dependent on agriculture and farmers will have to compete with drillers for water.
"Europe and some of the countries with shale potential have significantly less renewable water resources than the U.S.," the report warned.
A U.S. Initiative
In the United States, where the water-intensive drilling technique of fracking was invented, the government is taking a lead role in supporting the dissemination of the technology abroad, as well as promoting other energy projects, including building infrastructure to extract and transport liquid natural gas.
Over the past three years, President Obama has promoted shale gas during visits to China, India and Poland.
"We believe that there is the capacity technologically to extract that gas in a way that is entirely safe," Mr. Obama said in a speech in May in Warsaw, where the American Embassy co-hosted an international shale gas conference.
The Export-Import Bank of the United States has financed some of its biggest gas projects over the last several years, including the largest transaction in the bank's history -- $3 billion approved in 2009 for hundreds of miles of gas pipeline and a liquid natural gas plant and terminal project led by Exxon Mobil in Papua New Guinea.
The United States Geological Survey has offered training and technology to geologists exploring shale gas in Europe.
In 2009, the United States and China signed an agreement to promote accelerated development of shale gas in China, which has major shale gas deposits in Inner Mongolia in the north and in the country's restive western frontier, Xinjiang, which is characterized by severe droughts and a separatist movement.
The State Department's Global Shale Gas Initiative, begun in 2010, has been advising many foreign countries on fracking. It has organized a half-dozen trips this year for foreign officials to meet with American energy experts and to visit drilling sites in the United States.
The Web site for the initiative says that its primary goals are "to achieve greater energy security, meet environmental objectives and further U.S. economic and commercial interests."
Concern About Effects
Some economists and environmentalists say that while the governments of poorer countries may benefit from the new tax revenues and jobs, they may not be paying enough attention to the environmental risks of drilling. They also note that local residents -- who bear the brunt of the air pollution, potential water contamination from spills or underground seepage, and truck traffic that come with drilling -- may see few benefits.
"These projects have already started causing steep inflation in costs of local housing and services, and except for the lucky few who get temporary construction jobs, the economic conditions for local communities can actually get worse," said Doug Norlen, policy director of Pacific Environment, an advocacy and research organization that tracks federal and corporate financing of energy projects abroad.
The direct benefits of new drilling to American landowners -- they receive bonuses and royalties when they lease their land to drillers -- will generally not be shared by landowners abroad. In South Africa and many other countries looking to embrace the drilling, the minerals under a property are more often owned by governments, not individuals.
Mr. Norlen added that the influx of foreign construction workers in these projects could lead to conflicts with local and tribal communities. In one example, he noted, the United States government-financed project in Papua New Guinea to extract and transport liquid natural gas recently led to violent clashes between residents and foreign contractors.
But Jan Willem Eggink, general manager for Shell in South Africa, said that the Karoo project could eventually produce millions of dollars in direct investment and thousands of jobs for South Africans, which would help lower the nation's unemployment rate of about 25 percent.
"There is a huge energy problem looming for South Africa," he added, explaining that energy demand is growing rapidly and that shale gas coupled with renewables could help meet that new demand while also lowering the nation's dependence on Mozambique for gas.
Fracking involves injecting large amounts of water mixed with chemicals and sand at very high pressure deep underground to crack rock and release gas. After fracking, much of the water at each well returns to the surface mixed with toxic chemicals.
Shell's plan is to drill at least six exploratory wells over the next three years, and if the gas reserves appear profitable, it will start production with at least 1,500 wells several years later. Martin Bell, the water manager for Shell's Karoo project, said the company planned to recycle as much wastewater as possible, storing it temporarily in closed containers. Trucks will not be the primary method for moving waste or water, he said. Drilling waste, which could be especially toxic because the area is high in uranium deposits, will be shipped to disposal plants by pipes or by rail, Mr. Bell said.
Water needed for fracking may be brought in by rail from the coast, which is hundreds of miles away in some parts, or drawn from aquifers far below the ones that supply water for farmers. The company will tap into the aquifers that farmers use only if it can prove no adverse impact, Mr. Bell said.
In interviews, South African drilling regulators emphasized that producing and using more natural gas would help the country's air pollution problems and avoid increasing its already heavy dependence on coal for electricity, since coal is dirtier than natural gas when burned.
But in this sun-flooded hinterland, where sheep outnumber humans and rusty windmills pumping water dot the horizon, many residents say they would prefer to see the government bring in wind or solar farms, not new drilling.
"It just takes one big spill, leaky pipe or crack underground that their studies didn't catch, and a farm my family has run for four generations is done," said Trenly Spence, 44, as he dug up a clogged irrigation pipe that carries water across his 3,300 acres to where his 3,000 sheep and goats graze.
Mr. Spence added that farmers had been frustrated by the lack of information from Shell officials about the chemicals they would inject into the ground during fracking.
Shell officials said that they would disclose what they could about fracking formulas if they started drilling, but that they might be limited by trade secrets of their subcontractors.
In the United States, some drilling companies have been reluctant to reveal the chemicals they use in fracking, saying the information is proprietary.
Officials from the State Department's shale gas initiative have said that developing countries interested in fracking will need to create stronger protections for intellectual property rights so energy companies will think that they can safely maintain certain patents over their drilling techniques. Some environmentalists say that strengthening these intellectual property protections will only help energy companies argue that they do not have to disclose the chemicals they use in fracking abroad.
A spokesman for the State Department declined to answer questions about fracking and intellectual property rights. But he emphasized that the initiative's goal is to help countries make informed decisions about their resources, rather than promoting shale gas abroad.
"The regulatory and financial climate is obviously important to companies considering an investment in unconventional gas," the spokesman said in an e-mail. "But sound environmental regulations and policies are also critical, as is working with local communities and other stakeholders to understand the impact of shale gas on their lives."
The Future
Some legal experts say that the United States needs to be more concerned about environmental and other impacts as it promotes energy technology abroad. David Hunter, director of the Program on International and Comparative Environmental Law at American University, said, "Especially with energy projects, the U.S. and its funding institutions have a habit of promoting policies that foster a stable climate for foreign investors but that are not in the best interests of local populations."
In Peru, for example, the United States Export-Import bank provided more than $400 million in loan guarantees in 2008 for a liquefied natural gas terminal to export gas from the Camisea gas fields, which are in the Amazon rainforest. The project for drilling and pipelines in the Camisea, which received separate financing from the Inter-American Development Bank, has been dogged by spills, accusations that company officials bribed lawmakers and criticisms about exporting the gas rather than using more of it to lower prices for domestic consumers.
Energy companies are using fracking technology in parts of Canada, bringing jobs and wealth to gas-rich provinces like Alberta and British Columbia. But residents near drilling sites have complained that natural gas has seeped into their water wells making their tap water flammable. Drillers have denied responsibility.
In South Africa, pressure is mounting to proceed cautiously.
After public concerns were raised this year about drilling in the Karoo region, South African drilling officials set a moratorium on new licenses for exploration until February so the government could conduct more research.
In July, the Advertising Standards Authority of South Africa, an independent agency that sets guidelines for media companies, ruled that several of Shell's advertised claims -- including one that said fracking had never led to groundwater contamination -- were misleading or unsubstantiated and should be withdrawn. Shell said the advertisements were an accurate reflection of its opinion.
"The government is under a great deal of pressure to hurry up," said Hein Rust, director of disaster management for the central Karoo region. "But I don't think these decisions should be made on faith or until all the costs are known."

Abstract: Here are just a few of the economic shocks of the year: the earthquake and tsunami in Japan; the revolutions throughout the Arab world; the debt problems in Greece, and now other European countries, that are a drag on the European Union; the spike in stock market volatility from August onward; and the continuing political clashes in the United States over spending and taxes, along with Standard & Poor's downgrade of the country's credit rating in August. Bill Stone, chief investment strategist at PNC Wealth Management, backed dividend-paying stocks at the start of the year and never wavered, though he acknowledged after the third quarter that the reasons this call worked changed as the year went on.

Full text: I'M not the only one who has seen prognosticators through the years make a wrong call -- Dow 36,000! Dow 5,000! But I can't recall any of them being asked to explain months later why they slipped up.
So last January, I thought it worthwhile to find a group of analysts and advisers who would be accountable for their predictions, a group willing not just to make investment recommendations for 2011 but also amenable to my checking in every quarter to assess how they were doing.
Let me pause and thank the group for being good sports. Only one dropped out, when he left the firm, and one other was miffed when I highlighted a call he had changed.
As for the exercise itself, it did not turn out as I had expected. When 2011 began, many indicators in the United States were pointing to the start of an economic recovery, including improved consumer confidence and increased growth projections. What happened was far different and far more complicated.
Here are just a few of the economic shocks of the year: the earthquake and tsunami in Japan; the revolutions throughout the Arab world; the debt problems in Greece, and now other European countries, that are a drag on the European Union; the spike in stock market volatility from August onward; and the continuing political clashes in the United States over spending and taxes, along with Standard & Poor's downgrade of the country's credit rating in August.
"This is probably the hardest year I can remember in a very long time for managing money," said Richard Madigan, chief investment officer for J.P. Morgan's Global Access Portfolios. In 2008, "you could assess what you thought was happening in the world and dive into the trenches and fight it. This year was tough."
Still, an analyst's job is to get things right through thick and thin. So in the final column with this group, I asked the participants to identify their best and worst calls, what surprised them and to predict what lies ahead for 2012.
BEST AND WORST CALLS The one call everyone missed was just how much the prices of United States Treasury bonds would rise, even after Washington almost came to a standstill last summer over raising the debt ceiling and the country's credit rating was lowered. Beyond that, the best calls were a mix.
Bill Stone, chief investment strategist at PNC Wealth Management, backed dividend-paying stocks at the start of the year and never wavered, though he acknowledged after the third quarter that the reasons this call worked changed as the year went on.
In the beginning, he argued that money was going to move from bonds to stocks, and dividend-paying ones would rally first. Then, he saw a company's ability to pay dividends as a sign that these companies were well run. After the summer, he and many other analysts pointed out that dividend-paying stocks were a good option for income when the yields on 10-year Treasuries fell to around 2 percent.
Now, Mr. Stone said, the country is in a period of what he called financial repression, where interest rates are lower than inflation, and he said dividend-paying stocks were a good option for generating income and preparing investors for an eventual increase in inflation.
"Dividend-paying stocks at least give you a chance to win over some amount of time," he said. But the best plan back in January, he said, would have been to have "ignored all that and run to long-term Treasuries, even though it made no logical sense."
He was not alone in his enthusiasm for this asset class. Mr. Madigan said he had invested $2 billion in dividend-paying stocks in 2011, to good results. He said it was part of a broader strategy of focusing on less volatile investments.
A different rationale motivated Niall J. Gannon, director of wealth management at the Gannon Group at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, to focus on investing in consumer companies with a global reach, like Procter & Gamble or Gillette. (In many cases, these companies also pay dividends.) He remains convinced that the best strategy over the next 10 years is to focus on the middle class in emerging markets (even though his more profitable short-term call this year was on municipal bonds).
"I still have a positive view of humanity," Mr. Gannon said. "The world welcomed its seven billionth resident. I look at it as the seven billionth consumer. We're moving in the right direction."
SURPRISES The big surprise for everyone -- after Treasury prices -- was just how intense and frequent this year's crises were. Most members of the group were humbled, if unbowed, by what world events did to their finely wrought analyses.
Marc D. Stern, chief investment officer at Bessemer Trust, said he was glad that he did not get caught up in the emotional swings of the year. "We didn't panic," he said. "We made adjustments during the year, but we never went to a position of maximum defensiveness."
Yet he came across as the most humbled by the swoons of 2011, even though he made some good calls, like predicting solid corporate earnings growth, being skeptical of the value of the euro and adding money to high-yield bonds.
Richard Cookson, chief investment officer at Citi Private Bank, who was bearish and outspoken about the state of the global economy throughout the year, remained so at the end. "Nothing surprised me," he said. "We weren't as bearish as we should have been at the beginning of the year, but we were bearish."
He added, "We've thumped the table all year: property and credit bubbles never end well."
While most of the advisers said they would not change the calls they made in January, even knowing what they know now, Mr. Cookson went a step further and put out a list to clients, trumpeting the 13 calls he said he got right over the last two years -- including cutting investments in emerging markets, avoiding financial services stocks and moving heavily into fixed-income investments. He also noted his two bad calls -- he missed the 2010 rally in stocks and bought more Italian equities in February, only to see their value fall months later.
(Readers of the October column in this series may wonder about his pronouncement that "Greece will default in the next few weeks." To that, he said: "Greece is being kept on life support. It's pretty certain to default. The question is timing.")
THE NEXT YEAR Perhaps not surprisingly, no one was eager to make bold predictions for next year, at least none who departed from the prevailing, if discomforting, view that 2012 will be a year of more uncertainty.
Like the other analysts, Mr. Stone said that investors were worried that Europe was going to continue to be a cause for concern. He said he thought the economic picture would begin to improve next year, but "predicting when that will happen is hard to do."
Still, Mr. Stone said he believed that the United States economy would grow by 2.5 percent next year and that the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index would have single-digit growth. He predicted that global economic growth would be about 4 percent.
Mr. Madigan predicts that global growth will be about half that because the economies in emerging markets and Europe are going to slow even more and the half dozen national elections around the world are going to keep markets unsettled. "It's going to be another bouncy, bumpy, Tiggerish year next year," he said. "The question is, do you believe next year is the latter part of the bottoming process. If you do, you should be in the markets."
Whatever happens, Mr. Gannon said, investors need to tune out the headlines. "The short-term bumps are hard to take, but when you think there is an antidote to that, investors have been widely disappointed," he said. "The Goldilocks model of putting together a lot of smart guys who can make 8 percent when the market is down 20 percent -- you need to stop looking for that."

Full text: "The boom, not the slump, is the right time for austerity at the Treasury." So declared John Maynard Keynes in 1937, even as F.D.R. was about to prove him right by trying to balance the budget too soon, sending the United States economy -- which had been steadily recovering up to that point -- into a severe recession. Slashing government spending in a depressed economy depresses the economy further; austerity should wait until a strong recovery is well under way.
Unfortunately, in late 2010 and early 2011, politicians and policy makers in much of the Western world believed that they knew better, that we should focus on deficits, not jobs, even though our economies had barely begun to recover from the slump that followed the financial crisis. And by acting on that anti-Keynesian belief, they ended up proving Keynes right all over again.
In declaring Keynesian economics vindicated I am, of course, at odds with conventional wisdom. In Washington, in particular, the failure of the Obama stimulus package to produce an employment boom is generally seen as having proved that government spending can't create jobs. But those of us who did the math realized, right from the beginning, that the Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (more than a third of which, by the way, took the relatively ineffective form of tax cuts) was much too small given the depth of the slump. And we also predicted the resulting political backlash.
So the real test of Keynesian economics hasn't come from the half-hearted efforts of the U.S. federal government to boost the economy, which were largely offset by cuts at the state and local levels. It has, instead, come from European nations like Greece and Ireland that had to impose savage fiscal austerity as a condition for receiving emergency loans -- and have suffered Depression-level economic slumps, with real G.D.P. in both countries down by double digits.
This wasn't supposed to happen, according to the ideology that dominates much of our political discourse. In March 2011, the Republican staff of Congress's Joint Economic Committee released a report titled "Spend Less, Owe Less, Grow the Economy." It ridiculed concerns that cutting spending in a slump would worsen that slump, arguing that spending cuts would improve consumer and business confidence, and that this might well lead to faster, not slower, growth.
They should have known better even at the time: the alleged historical examples of "expansionary austerity" they used to make their case had already been thoroughly debunked. And there was also the embarrassing fact that many on the right had prematurely declared Ireland a success story, demonstrating the virtues of spending cuts, in mid-2010, only to see the Irish slump deepen and whatever confidence investors might have felt evaporate.
Amazingly, by the way, it happened all over again this year. There were widespread proclamations that Ireland had turned the corner, proving that austerity works -- and then the numbers came in, and they were as dismal as before.
Yet the insistence on immediate spending cuts continued to dominate the political landscape, with malign effects on the U.S. economy. True, there weren't major new austerity measures at the federal level, but there was a lot of "passive" austerity as the Obama stimulus faded out and cash-strapped state and local governments continued to cut.
Now, you could argue that Greece and Ireland had no choice about imposing austerity, or, at any rate, no choices other than defaulting on their debts and leaving the euro. But another lesson of 2011 was that America did and does have a choice; Washington may be obsessed with the deficit, but financial markets are, if anything, signaling that we should borrow more.
Again, this wasn't supposed to happen. We entered 2011 amid dire warnings about a Greek-style debt crisis that would happen as soon as the Federal Reserve stopped buying bonds, or the rating agencies ended our triple-A status, or the superdupercommittee failed to reach a deal, or something. But the Fed ended its bond-purchase program in June; Standard & Poor's downgraded America in August; the supercommittee deadlocked in November; and U.S. borrowing costs just kept falling. In fact, at this point, inflation-protected U.S. bonds pay negative interest: investors are willing to pay America to hold their money.
The bottom line is that 2011 was a year in which our political elite obsessed over short-term deficits that aren't actually a problem and, in the process, made the real problem -- a depressed economy and mass unemployment -- worse.
The good news, such as it is, is that President Obama has finally gone back to fighting against premature austerity -- and he seems to be winning the political battle. And one of these years we might actually end up taking Keynes's advice, which is every bit as valid now as it was 75 years ago.

Abstract: [...] many are young women. Many economists initially thought that the shrinking labor force -- which drove down November's unemployment rate -- was caused primarily by discouraged older workers giving up on the job market.

Links: http://findit.library.jhu.edu/resolve?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Anytimes&amp;atitle=Instead+of+Work%2C+Younger+Women+Head+to+School%3A+%5BBusiness%2FFinancial+Desk%5D&amp;title=New+York+Times&amp;issn=03624331&amp;date=2011-12-29&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=A.1&amp;au=Rampell%2C+Catherine&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=New+York+Times&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/

Full text: Workers are dropping out of the labor force in droves, and they are mostly women. In fact, many are young women. But they are not dropping out forever; instead, these young women seem to be postponing their working lives to get more education. There are now -- for the first time in three decades -- more young women in school than in the work force.
"I was working part-time at Starbucks for a year and a half," said Laura Baker, 24, who started a master's program in strategic communications this fall at the University of Denver. "I wasn't willing to just stay there. I had to do something."
Many economists initially thought that the shrinking labor force -- which drove down November's unemployment rate -- was caused primarily by discouraged older workers giving up on the job market. Instead, many of the workers on the sidelines are young people upgrading their skills, which could portend something like the postwar economic boom, when millions of World War II veterans went to college through the G.I. Bill instead of immediately entering, and overwhelming, the job market.
Now, as was the case then, one sex is the primary beneficiary. Though young women in their late teens and early 20's view today's economic lull as an opportunity to upgrade their skills, their male counterparts are more likely to take whatever job they can find. The longer-term consequences, economists say, are that the next generation of women may have a significant advantage over their male counterparts, whose career options are already becoming constrained.
For now at least, many young women still feel that the deck is stacked against them.
"Almost everyone in my program is female," said Ms. Baker, who hopes a master's degree will help her get a job running communications at a nonprofit group. "That's partly because of the program, but also because as women we feel like we have to be more educated to be able to compete in really any field."
Women still earn significantly less than men. And in the two and a half years since the recovery officially began, men age 16 to 24 have gained 178,000 jobs, while their female counterparts have lost 255,000 positions, according to the Labor Department.
Apparently discouraged by scant openings, 412,000 young women have dropped out of the labor force entirely in the last two and a half years, meaning they are not looking for work.
Among young men, the labor force fell during the recession but has been flat since the recovery began. Today, across all age groups, an unemployed female worker is 35 percent more likely to drop out of the labor force in the next month than an unemployed male worker.
Some studies suggest that women are pickier about their job choices than men. Already earning lower pay, women are less willing to work when wages fall further, especially if they are able to rely on an employed (and these days, often newly re-employed) husband. Women are also more reluctant to work night or weekend shifts, according to government data on how Americans spend their time, partly because they have more family responsibilities.
"The jobs out there just aren't very good, and men seem more willing to take them for whatever reason," said Jonathan L. Willis, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. "The women are looking at those same jobs and saying, 'I'll be more productive elsewhere.' "
Then there are societal influences that affect a person's willingness to take a lesser job or return to school.
"There is still this heavy cultural message that men should be out there earning money and supporting themselves, and they feel more distressed by losing their breadwinner role," said Stephanie Coontz, director of research at the Council on Contemporary Families. "We've made much more progress overcoming the 'feminine mystique' than this masculine mystique."
While these roles evolve, community colleges are reporting record enrollment.
Both men and women are going back to school, but the growth in enrollment is significantly larger for women (who dominated college campuses even before the financial crisis). In the last two years, the number of women ages 18 to 24 in school rose by 130,000, compared with a gain of 53,000 for young men.
The education gap aside, in some ways young women will already have an advantage over men in the coming decade. Many of the occupations expected to have the most growth, like home health aides and dental hygienists, have traditionally been filled by women. That is not to say that men cannot take those positions, but they may not want to.
"Today young girls are told they can do anything, go into any occupation. But if boys express any interest in traditionally female occupations, they get teased and bullied," Ms. Coontz said. "Lots of guys are not understanding what's happening to traditional low-income or middle-income male jobs."
Jobs in the male-dominated manufacturing industry and in other sectors involving manual labor have been, and still are, in structural decline. These careers can also be hard to maintain indefinitely because youthful strength eventually fades. And now many manufacturing workers do not have pensions to carry them through when their bodies do break down.
"It doesn't surprise me that in a poor economy women are ramping up their schooling," said Heather Boushey, an economist at the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning research organization. "The real question is: Why aren't more men doing that too?"
The main risk in going back to school is the accompanying student loan debt. Tuition increases have been outpacing inflation for years, a trend accelerated by state budget cuts.
"Our funding per student has been cut 25 percent in the last three years," said Stephen Scott, the president of Wake Technical Community College in Raleigh, N.C., which is one of the fastest-growing community colleges in the country. Consequently, class sizes have risen, and so has tuition. But the students -- again, mostly women -- still pour in.
"We now have 6,000 students on a waiting list because we didn't have the resources to offer more classes," he said.
Those attending more expensive private schools, like Ms. Baker, will have an even tougher time guaranteeing that their educational investment pays off. Including the loans that financed her undergraduate education at Wartburg College in Waverly, Iowa, she will complete her master's program next year owing about $200,000 in debt.
"I have to have faith that I will eventually get a good job that pays enough to pay my living expenses and pay back my loans," she said, "and hopefully make me happy in the process."

Full text: WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Obama administration on Tuesday declined to label China a currency manipulator after seeing recent increases in the value of the renminbi compared with the dollar.
The decision angered some manufacturing groups, which have accused China of artificially holding down the value of its currency, the renminbi, to gain trade advantages. A cheaper renminbi makes Chinese goods less expensive when they are shipped to the United States. It also makes American goods more expensive in China. Both could increase America's trade deficit with China, which is on pace to reach a record high this year.
The Treasury Department said the renminbi had appreciated 12 percent against the dollar in the last 18 months, after adjusting for inflation. In addition, the department said in a semiannual report that China promised at two high-level meetings last month to make the renminbi's exchange rate more flexible.
Still, the Chinese currency is "substantially undervalued" and its appreciation "is insufficient and more progress is needed," the report noted. The Treasury Department will "press for policy changes that yield greater exchange rate flexibility" and "level the playing field."
The currency report evaluates exchange rate policies of all major American trading partners. It was scheduled to be released on Oct. 15, but the administration delayed its release until after last month's meetings.
Mitt Romney, a former Massachusetts governor and a leading candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, has criticized the administration for refusing to cite China for manipulating its currency. Mr. Romney said in October that, if elected, he would take that step on his first day in office. That could lead to trade sanctions against China.
Scott N. Paul, executive director of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, also questioned the decision. "I'm disappointed that President Obama has now formally refused six times to cite China for its currency manipulation, a practice which has contributed to the loss of hundreds of thousands of American manufacturing jobs," Mr. Paul said.
China has recently taken action that could result in the renminbi appreciating without prodding from the United States.
China and Japan agreed this week to accept the others' currency when trading. Currently, they each convert their currency to dollars. That has made trade between the two Asian economic giants more expensive.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- When Representative Ed Pastor was first elected to Congress two decades ago, he was comfortably ensconced in the middle class. Mr. Pastor, a Democrat from Arizona, held $100,000 or so in savings accounts in the mid-1990s and had a retirement pension, but like many Americans, he also owed the banks nearly as much in loans.
Today, Mr. Pastor, a miner's son and a former high school teacher, is a member of a not-so-exclusive club: Capitol Hill millionaires. That group has grown in recent years to include nearly half of all members of Congress -- 250 in all -- and the wealth gap between lawmakers and their constituents appears to be growing quickly, even as Congress debates unemployment benefits, possible cuts in food stamps and a "millionaire's tax."
Mr. Pastor buys a Powerball lottery ticket every weekend and says he does not consider himself rich. Indeed, within the halls of Congress, where the median net worth is $913,000 and climbing, he is not. He is a rank-and-file millionaire. But compared with the country at large, where the median net worth is $100,000 and has dropped significantly since 2004, he and most of his fellow lawmakers are true aristocrats.
Largely insulated from the country's economic downturn since 2008, members of Congress -- many of them among the "1 percenters" denounced by Occupy Wall Street protesters -- have gotten much richer even as most of the country has become much poorer in the last six years, according to an analysis by The New York Times based on data from the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonprofit research group.
Congress has never been a place for paupers. From plantation owners in the pre-Civil War era to industrialists in the early 1900s to ex-Wall Street financiers and Internet executives today, it has long been populated with the rich, including scions of families like the Guggenheims, Hearsts, Kennedys and Rockefellers.
But rarely has the divide appeared so wide, or the public contrast so stark, between lawmakers and those they represent.
The wealth gap may go largely unnoticed in good times. "But with the American public feeling all this economic pain, people just resent it more," said Alan J. Ziobrowski, a professor at Georgia State who studied lawmakers' stock investments.
There is broad debate about just why the wealth gap appears to be growing. For starters, the prohibitive costs of political campaigning may discourage the less affluent from even considering a candidacy. Beyond that, loose ethics controls, shrewd stock picks, profitable land deals, favorable tax laws, inheritances and even marriages to wealthy spouses are all cited as possible explanations for the rising fortunes on Capitol Hill.
What is clear is that members of Congress are getting richer compared not only with the average American worker, but also with other very rich Americans.
While the median net worth of members of Congress jumped 15 percent from 2004 to 2010, the net worth of the richest 10 percent of Americans remained essentially flat. For all Americans, median net worth dropped 8 percent, based on inflation-adjusted data from Moody's Analytics.
Going back further, the median wealth of House members grew some two and a half times between 1984 and 2009 in inflation-adjusted dollars, while the wealth of the average American family has actually declined slightly in that same time period, according to data cited by The Washington Post in an article published Monday on its Web site.
With millionaire status now the norm, the rarefied air in the Capitol these days is $100 million. That lofty level appears to have been surpassed by at least 10 members, led by Representative Darrell Issa, a California Republican and former auto alarm magnate who is worth somewhere between $195 million and $700 million. (Because federal law requires lawmakers to disclose their assets only in broad dollar ranges, more precise estimates are impossible.)
Their wealth has created occasional political problems for Congress's richest.
Mr. Issa, for instance, has faced outside scrutiny because of the overlap of his Congressional work and outside interests, including extensive investments with Wall Street firms like Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs, as well as land holdings in his San Diego district. In one case, he obtained some $800,000 in federal earmarks for a road-widening project running along his commercial property.
Senator John Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat who is married to Teresa Heinz Kerry, set off an uproar last year when it was disclosed that he had docked his $7 million, 76-foot yacht not in his home state but in neighboring Rhode Island, which has no sales or use tax on pleasure boats. (Mr. Kerry, worth at least $181 million, voluntarily paid $400,000 in Massachusetts taxes after criticism.)
Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, was challenged about her wealth, as much as $196 million, by a member of her own party a few weeks ago. Representative Laura Richardson, a California Democrat who is among the poorest members of Congress with as much as $464,000 in debt, attacked Ms. Pelosi at a closed-door Democratic caucus meeting for endorsing a Congressional pay freeze, according to a report in Politico that was confirmed by other members.
Ms. Richardson angrily told Ms. Pelosi that, unlike her, some members needed the raise. Members now make a base pay of $174,000 and would automatically get a cost-of-living adjustment unless they were to decide, for a third straight year, to pass it up. Sheila Krumholz, executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics, said the rising Congressional wealth fuels public doubts about whether members are more focused on their constituents' interests or their own investment portfolios.
"There's always a concern that they can't truly understand or relate to the hardships that their constituents feel -- that rich people just don't get it," she said.
In an effort to gauge how directly the country's economic problems affected lawmakers, The New York Times contacted the offices of the 534 current members (one seat is vacant) for an informal survey. It asked if they had close friends or family members who had lost jobs or homes since the 2008 downturn.
Only 18 members responded.
Half the respondents said they had close friends or relatives who lost homes, while the other half said their personal contact was limited to constituents who came for help.
Two-thirds said they had close friends or relatives who had been laid off or had shut down a business during the downturn. The rest knew no one in that category personally.
Representative Anna G. Eshoo, a California Democrat who took part in the survey, said several cousins in their 40s and 50s whom she considers brothers and sisters lost their jobs recently. Without college degrees, none have found work, and they have emphasized to her the importance of unemployment benefits.
"Personal stories are very powerful because it's not a theory," Ms. Eshoo said. "It's not talking points of a party. These are people experiencing the harshness of what is an economic depression for them."
Multimillionaires in Congress "view life through a different lens," she said.
Ms. Eshoo herself has escaped the worries weighing on her cousins. While she reported being in debt in 2004, she is now worth an estimated $1.8 million, her financial reports show. She said the rise came mostly from the sale of a family home where she lived for 40 years.
"I was fortunate," she said. "I've lived from paycheck to paycheck most of my life, and I'm a single mother."
One likely cause of the rising wealth, political analysts say, is the growing cost of a political campaign. A successful Senate run cost on average nearly $10 million last year, and a successful House race was $1.4 million, significantly above past elections.
The prohibitive cost has inevitably drawn richer candidates who can help bankroll their own campaigns and attract donations from rich friends -- while deterring less well-off candidates, political analysts say.
The data analyzed by The Times corroborated the idea that incoming members are in fact richer than those in the past. The freshman class of 106 members elected last year, including many Tea Party-backed Republicans, had a median net worth of $864,000 -- an inflation-adjusted increase of 26 percent from the 2004 freshmen.
Once in Congress, members benefit from many financial perks unavailable to most Americans. Beyond a base salary of $174,000 -- an increase of about 10 percent since 2004, somewhat less than inflation -- members get extra pay for senior posts and generous medical and pension benefits, as well as accouterments of power often financed by taxpayers or their campaigns.
While the housing collapse nationwide has hurt many Americans, lawmakers still find the real estate sector the most popular place to park their money, statistics from the Center of Responsive Politics show, and members of Congress continue to profit from their investments there. Perhaps the most tantalizing but hotly debated factor in the rising wealth of Congress is lawmakers' performance in the stock markets -- and the question of whether they are using their access to confidential information to enrich themselves.
In a study completed this year, Mr. Ziobrowski at Georgia State and his colleagues found that House members saw the stocks they owned outperform the market by 6 percent a year. Their research from several years ago found that senators did even better, at 12 percent above average. The researchers attributed the performance to a "significant information advantage" that lawmakers hold by virtue of their positions and the fact they are not bound by insider-trading law.
However, a separate study last year by researchers at Yale and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that the portfolios of lawmakers actually performed somewhat worse than average investors. It found that members did do better when investing in companies in their home districts or associated with campaign donors -- suggesting that they benefited from their political connections -- but still not as well as the average investor.
While concerns go back decades about lawmakers trading on confidential information, the issue drew renewed attention with a new book on the topic, "Throw Them All Out" by Peter Schweizer, and a "60 Minutes" report in November. Both linked high-level briefings that Congressional leaders received on the 2008 financial crisis and on health care to their purchase and sale of certain stocks.
Members insisted that they never traded on information that was not public, and some Congressional leaders pointed out that their investments were in blind trusts managed by professional advisers. Nonetheless, the publicity led some 90 members of Congress to call anew for a ban on insider trading.
Mr. Pastor, the Arizona congressman, said he never relied on fancy stock investments to make money. He said the key to his good fortune was watching what he spends, paying off debts and, at age 68, collecting Social Security and a pension from his days as a county supervisor.
"I don't see myself as a man of great wealth," he said. "To say that I'm enjoying a millionaire's lifestyle -- well, I can tell you, I guess a millionaire's income doesn't go very far these days."

Full text: BEIJING -- China and Japan have agreed to start direct trading of their currencies, officials announced during a visit here on Monday by Japan's prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda.
Japan will also apply to buy Chinese bonds next year, allowing it to accumulate more renminbi in its foreign-exchange reserves. The moves were among several that emerged from Mr. Noda's meetings with President Hu Jintao, which focused on how the two nations could work together to maintain peace on the Korean peninsula.
China is the world's second-largest economy while Japan is the third largest, and the currency agreement is part of a move away from using dollars. Chinese officials have said recently they would like to broaden the global use of the renminbi, also known as the yuan, and want to see more countries move away from relying on dollars as the worldwide currency.
They hold the world's largest foreign-currency reserves -- China has about $3.2 trillion, while Japan holds $1.3 trillion -- and any moves to reconstitute the makeup of those holdings could change the global currency map.
"Chinese officials have made it clear that they believe the international economy is too heavily dominated by the dollar," said Charles A. Kupchan, a professor of international affairs at Georgetown University and a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. "They believe, as part of China's rise, that the international system should move to a more balanced structure."
Because the renminbi is not fully convertible, however, it will not compete soon as a global reserve currency, he said. Still, the agreement "could be a baby step in that direction," Professor Kupchan said. Experts in global trade said China and Japan had both practical and political motives for the pact. Neither side has announced a timetable, agreeing only that officials will discuss possible measures.
Given the proximity of China and Japan, along with the likelihood that the two countries will serve as each other's biggest trading partners over the next century, it makes sense for them to trade directly without using dollars, said Jeffrey H. Bergstrand, a professor of finance at Mendoza College of Business at the University of Notre Dame.
And the more China loosens its grip on the renminbi, helping to correct what by some measures is a currency undervalued by almost 40 percent against the dollar and 45 percent against the yen, the greater its purchasing power will become, allowing it to import more. This is especially important for Japan, which has been reeling as the dollar has weakened, making American consumers unable to spend as much on Japanese electronics and cars as they used to.
From a practical standpoint, both China and Japan want to reduce the transaction costs of direct bilateral trade and the risks of volatility in exchange rates, said Professor Kupchan.
"With markets looking askance at both the euro and the U.S. dollar, investors in both China and Japan would find it attractive to trade directly," Professor Kupchan said. On a more political level, he said, the pact also represents an important step in improving bilateral ties between Beijing and Tokyo.
As for the long-term ramifications for the United States, analysts said it was difficult to predict before the pact took effect.
In the shorter term, the agreement is likely to lead to continued weakening of the dollar against the renminbi, Professor Bergstrand said. That should help the United States trade deficit with China, he said, increasing American imports while weakening imports from China. On the other hand, he said, the Sino-Japanese currency agreement is likely to diminish the dominance of the dollar in global trade.
"The Chinese yuan will increasingly play an important role in Asia," he said. "It does mean that the U.S. dollar will be less important as a currency for transactions in Pacific rim trade."
Professor Bergstrand compared the role of the dollar on the world stage now to the waning of the British pound 100 years ago as the most prominent currency for international transactions.
For more than a decade, critics have said the government has kept the value of its currency artificially low, giving Chinese exporters an unfair advantage over American counterparts by making Chinese goods cheaper overseas. Washington has pushed for a revaluation. Beginning in June 2010, facing increased inflation, China began to let its currency float gradually up.
Professor Kupchan of Georgetown said the currency pact is more symbolic than significant right now for the United States. "This pact hardly unseats the dollar as the world's dominant currency," he said. "But it is a clear sign that China is headed in the direction of internationalizing the renminbi."

Abstract: A quick glance at the numbers shows that the S.& P. 500 index of large domestic stocks has gone virtually nowhere since the technology bubble burst in 2000, while the Barclays United States aggregate bond index has returned more than 6 percent a year, on average.

Full text: WITH only a week left in 2011, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has a dubious distinction: its performance has been far worse than that of a basic basket of bonds in the last 12 years. But while betting on a large-cap stock index may not have paid off over that time, it would be wrong to assume that this has been the case for all sectors of the market.
A quick glance at the numbers shows that the S.& P. 500 index of large domestic stocks has gone virtually nowhere since the technology bubble burst in 2000, while the Barclays United States aggregate bond index has returned more than 6 percent a year, on average.
Yet long-term-minded investors who had the patience to hold a diversified portfolio have done much better than that in other types of equities, said Sam Stovall, chief equity strategist at S.& P. Capital IQ.
For instance, shares of companies that paid dividends returned nearly 8 percent a year, on average, since the start of 2000, based on the Dow Jones U.S. Select Dividend index. Several specific sectors, meanwhile, including utilities and consumer staples, posted solid gains despite the so-called lost decade, the period from 2000 through 2009 when the broad stock market lost ground.
Jeffrey Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL Financial, is quick to point out that conservative investments weren't the only ones that thrived.
Economically sensitive sectors, like energy, also posted strong gains, along with shares of small and midsize domestic companies. They're not defensive holdings, he said. And no matter: although the economy has hit some rough patches, the S.& P. 400 midcap index and the S.& P. 600 index of small-company shares have each returned more than 7 percent, annualized, since 2000. Although that's below their long-term historical average, it outpaces both bonds and inflation. Emerging-market stocks, too, have enjoyed a strong run in recent years, even though they sank in 2011.
What does this disparate group of winning equities have in common?
One feature jumps out for James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management. "They're not large-cap tech," he said. He noted that at the end of the 1990s, the S.& P. 500's performance was driven largely by a handful of the biggest growth-oriented stocks found mainly in the technology sector.
"Underneath that group, you had a lot of other types of stocks, like small caps and defensive-minded shares, that were actually being pounded," Mr. Paulsen said. "But the tech boom covered that up." In other words, the performance of these equities was really about valuations.
William Reichenstein, a professor of investment management at Baylor University, points out that in January 2000, the price-to-earnings ratio of the S.& P. 500, based on 10 years of averaged earnings, was 43.8. That's more than double the average of around 19 since 1953, he said, which would help explain why blue-chip domestic stocks have fared poorly so far in this century.
Yet smaller stocks, dividend-paying defensive issues and emerging-market shares were all being overlooked back in the late 1990s, and, as a result, were trading at relatively attractive valuations.
Of course, all of this raises the question: What types of stocks are likely to outpace the broad market in the coming years because of their appealing valuations today?
Jack A. Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank, argues that because of the steep losses that emerging-market stocks suffered of late, their prices are starting to look attractive again.
"As the emerging markets got hammered this year, they went from trading at a 15 to 20 percent premium to the S.& P. to trading at a 15 to 20 percent discount," he said.
At the other end of the spectrum, Mr. Ablin argued, the group that clearly underperformed in recent years -- large blue-chip stocks in the S.& P. 500 -- also seemed to be priced at attractive enough levels to bounce back.
But Duncan W. Richardson, chief equity investment officer at Eaton Vance, argues that the investing landscape is not so clear-cut as it was after the tech bubble burst a dozen years ago.
Back then, he said, the market was divided between large technology stocks and everything else, with tech stocks looking frothy and many other parts of the market priced attractively. "Today it's more of a horse race between equity categories," Mr. Richardson said, noting that this makes picking the winners that much harder.
AT the very least, investors can try to steer clear of making big bets on the potential losers.
"One key is to avoid becoming enamored with a glitzy asset class -- especially after a long period of dramatically good returns," Mr. Reichenstein said.
He noted that tech stocks in the Nasdaq composite index disappointed investors after their surge from 1995 to 1999. In fact, nearly a dozen years after its peak at 5,048, the Nasdaq is back only to 2,618. Similarly, he said, "after the dramatic returns of Japanese stocks in the 1980s, the Nikkei index is selling at less than one-fourth its 1989 closing price --22 years later."
What does that mean for investors? Well, Mr. Reichenstein said, "now may not be the time to load up on gold."

Abstract: Throw in an alienated Kurdish minority combined with an Iran that erupted in 2009 and is now struggling with economic sanctions and inflation, and the possibilities of regional destabilization, mass refugee flows and even war do not seem terribly remote. Soli Ozel, professor of international relations at Istanbul's Kadir Has University, said that European and American economic decline, coupled with the Arab Spring, were magnifying Turkey's sense of its own importance as it evolves into the model of democracy for the Arab world.

Full text: ISTANBUL -- In a deepening diplomatic rupture, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey accused France on Friday of genocide against Algerians in the period of French colonial rule, one day after France made it a crime to deny the Armenian genocide by the Ottoman Turks.
"Approximately 15 percent of the population in Algeria have been subjected to a massacre by the French starting from 1945," Mr. Erdogan said of the French dominion, which ended in 1962. "This is genocide."
Mr. Erdogan's sharp remarks seemed to severely dent Turkey's already fraught talks on joining the European Union. But more immediately, they underscored concerns both at home and abroad that Turkey's expansive new sense of self-confidence -- buttressed by its emerging role as a leader in the Middle East -- might be tipping into arrogance, threatening to alienate allies and foes at a critical time.
Turkey halted diplomatic consultations and military dealings with France on Thursday after the lower house of the French Parliament backed the bill, which would impose a fine of about $58,700 and a year in jail for those who deny the genocide of up to 1.5 million Armenians between 1915 and 1918. Turkish lawmakers also called on France to investigate its own atrocities in Algeria.
Turkey faces a raft of foreign-policy challenges on its doorstep, any one of which could derail its long-term goal of obtaining regional power status. France, a powerful member of the European Union, has played a leading role in thwarting Turkey's efforts to join the group, so the latest clash is likely to harden French attitudes even more.
An increasingly outsize national ego, analysts say, had already helped to fray ties with Europe. With talks to join the union hopelessly stalled, many of Turkey's 79 million people have greeted the euro crisis with barely concealed glee, saying Europe has rejected them because they are Muslim.
Closer to home, three of the most volatile states in the world -- Syria, Iraq and Iran -- are lined up along Turkey's southern and eastern borders. Syria is already in a state of civil war, and Iraq seems to be flirting once again with sectarian strife and dissolution. Throw in an alienated Kurdish minority combined with an Iran that erupted in 2009 and is now struggling with economic sanctions and inflation, and the possibilities of regional destabilization, mass refugee flows and even war do not seem terribly remote.
Facing such threats, analysts and diplomats say, Turkey needs to resist the temptation to gloat and swagger. Soli Ozel, professor of international relations at Istanbul's Kadir Has University, said that European and American economic decline, coupled with the Arab Spring, were magnifying Turkey's sense of its own importance as it evolves into the model of democracy for the Arab world.
"Turks are saying, 'We are now on the rise, you are running out of steam and we don't have to take any nonsense from Westerners,' " he said. But he added, "There is a fine line between self-confidence and hubris."
Turkey and its charismatic prime minister, Mr. Erdogan, could be forgiven for displaying some vanity. He has overhauled a country once haunted by military coups into a regional democratic powerhouse. He is so popular in the Arab world that there has been a surge in babies named Tayyip.
While Turkey's economy surges -- growing by 8.2 percent in the third quarter, second only to China -- Europe is sputtering and Greece, a longtime rival, has been flattened by the sovereign debt crisis. With its new clout as a leader in a region long dominated by the United States, Turkey has also been basking in its roles as the voice of regional indignation against Syria and the chief critic of Israel.
Earlier this month a deputy prime minister boldly lectured Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. that it was Turkey, and not the struggling economies of the United States and Europe, that would win the 21st century.
"The fast fish, not the big fish, eats the small fish," said the official, Ali Babacan, who oversees the economy. Challenging his host's boastful tone, Mr. Biden reminded the audience that in a sea of young sharks, the United States was still the whale.
Six years ago, Burak Turna, a Turkish writer, was mocked here as a literary shock jock after he wrote a futuristic novel in which Turkish commandos besiege Berlin, lay waste to Europe and take control of the Continent. Now, he says, the same people who once dismissed him are celebrating him. "There is a new air being pumped into the Turkish consciousness," he said. But, he warned, "We shouldn't be too brave or overconfident."
Indeed, for all of Turkey's recent achievements, its aim of having "zero problems" with its neighbors has shown few successes.
Turkish officials tried in vain for months to persuade President Bashar al-Assad of Syria to halt his violent crackdown against civilians, before finally turning against him. Turkey has been unable to resolve conflicts with Cyprus and Armenia. Its recent decision to host a NATO radar installation has rankled Iran. Relations with Israel collapsed after Israeli troops killed nine people aboard a Turkish flotilla trying to break the blockade of Gaza.
In September, the limits of Turkey's appeal as a political model were laid bare when Mr. Erdogan told the Egyptian satellite channel Dream TV that secularism was not the enemy of religion and that Egypt should embrace a secular constitution. A spokesman for Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood, which won first-round parliamentary elections there, told the Egyptian daily Al Ahram that Mr. Erdogan was interfering in Egyptian affairs. (Mr. Erdogan's aides said the term secularism had been mistranslated as atheism.)
Nor were many Kosovar Albanians amused in August when Turkey's minister of education, Omer Dincer, asked his Kosovo counterpart to alter offending paragraphs from history textbooks, which he said insulted the Ottoman Turks. Local historians protested that Turkey was trying to whitewash centuries of Ottoman subjugation.
The perils of standing in Turkey's way became abundantly clear at the United Nations during the annual General Assembly meeting of world leaders this fall.
Mr. Erdogan was on the fourth floor of the General Assembly hall when he learned that the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, whom he ardently supports, was making his address demanding full United Nations membership for Palestine. When Mr. Erdogan rushed to the nearest entrance to take Turkey's seat on the main floor, a security guard refused to let him pass. When Mr. Erdogan pressed forward, a loud scuffle erupted that was audible four flours below.
One Western diplomat noted that "the Turks were literally throwing their weight around."
Yet Turkey's many defenders say the West cannot expect Turkey to play regional leader and then criticize it when it flexes its muscles. Moreover, they note, the country is entitled to defend its dignity.
At the summit meeting of the Group of 20 major economies in Cannes, France, in November, cameras showed Mr. Erdogan suddenly kneeling down when he noticed a sticker of the Turkish flag on the floor to mark the position where he was supposed to stand for a group photo, near President Obama.
He gently folded it and put it in his pocket.

Slight Increase Last Month In Spending by Consumers

Full text: WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- Consumer spending in the United States was tepid in November, and a gauge of business investment plans fell for a second consecutive month, pointing to some loss of momentum in the economy.
But other data on Friday added to signs that a tentative recovery in the housing market was under way, which should help to support growth. The Commerce Department said consumer spending ticked up 0.1 percent after rising by the same margin in October. Economists polled by Reuters had expected spending, which accounts for two-thirds of the nation's economic activity, to rise 0.3 percent last month.
When adjusted for inflation, spending rose 0.2 percent last month after a similar gain in October.
In another report, the department said nonmilitary capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending, fell 1.2 percent last month after declining 0.9 percent in October.
Shipments of these so-called core capital goods, which go into calculations of gross domestic product, also fell.
The reports tempered expectations for fourth-quarter economic growth, although many analysts still expect it to top a 3 percent annual rate after a 1.8 percent third-quarter pace.
"It appears we have a little more consumer spending but less investment spending than we thought," said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. "However, we expect those two developments to cancel each other out. At this point we still look for real G.D.P. growth in the fourth quarter of around 3 percent."
The tepid consumer spending data stood in stark contrast with the robust sales reported for Black Friday, the traditional start to the holiday shopping season. Some retailers have been forced to offer heavy discounts to get shoppers to spend.
"Retail has been very promotional and consumers have been very value-conscious," Best Buy's chief executive, Brian Dunn, said in a conference call last week.
Income ticked up 0.1 percent, the weakest reading since August, as wages and salaries fell. Disposable income was flat.
A strengthening in the labor market has offered some hope income growth will quicken, but analysts said the report augured poorly for consumer spending at the start of the new year.
"The lack of real income growth really raises questions as to what is going to happen to the economy in the first quarter," said Mark Vitner, senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, N.C.
While households may be spending less, they are starting to show more interest in buying houses, the Commerce Department said Friday in a separate report. Sales of new single-family homes rose 1.6 percent in November to a seasonally adjusted 315,000-unit annual rate.
That was the highest level in seven months. In addition, the months' supply of houses on the market dropped to a five-and-a-half-year low.
Data this week showed a rise in sales of previously owned homes and surge in housing starts, but more progress will depend on the health of household finances.

Debating Financial Strategies for the New Year After a Downbeat 2011

Abstract: Probably the only investors bragging about their returns are the ones who perfectly timed their purchases of United States Treasury bonds and gold -- two asset classes that most analysts said were overvalued as 2011 began. Odds are, you'll miss the rally when one or more uncertainties -- euro, U.S. fiscal policy, U.S. election -- resolves itself, leaving you with the volatility but not the return you'd hoped for.

Full text: FOR any investor paying attention to political and economic issues, 2012 looks bleak.
Republicans and Democrats in the United States seem incapable of agreeing on anything. In Europe, the search for a solution to Greece's debt problems has been overshadowed by questions about the continued existence of a single currency for the European Monetary Union.
Add at least a half-dozen crucial elections in 2012 -- including ones in France, Greece and the United States -- and a political transition in China, and pessimism about what lies ahead seems fairly rational.
Yet a year ago, the outlook for 2011 seemed the exact opposite of what the year turned out to be. Economists were raising their growth projections, consumer confidence was improving and a tax-cut compromise in Congress was putting more cash into pocketbooks. An accelerating economic recovery seemed in the offing.
Of course, that was not how the year turned out. Probably the only investors bragging about their returns are the ones who perfectly timed their purchases of United States Treasury bonds and gold -- two asset classes that most analysts said were overvalued as 2011 began. (Of course with gold, the people gloating the most are the ones who sold it at its August peak.)
So how should you think about next year? Should you hide for one more year, or charge forward with some sort of plan?
For this week's column, I asked a group of people whose opinions have impressed me to ponder this conundrum. Next week, I will share some final thoughts and 2012 predictions from the group of five strategists and investors that I have spoken to each quarter. My hope is that in mixing theory and practice, the two columns will offer investors a better sense of both how they should and will act next year.
THE ENVIRONMENT When Standard & Poor's downgraded the credit rating of the United States in August, investors rushed to buy Treasury bonds, the very asset that had just become less creditworthy. This might seem utterly irrational, but it did not surprise Daniel Kahneman, the psychologist who won the Nobel in economic science for work that became the foundation of behavioral economics.
"Treasuries just feel safe," he said. "When you're worried, you go to the safe thing. It's quite a normal reaction."
I called Mr. Kahneman because I had been reading his new book "Thinking, Fast and Slow" (Farrar Strauss & Giroux) and was fascinated by his division of people's thinking into two systems. System 1 is fast; it's intuition. System 2 is slower and moderates System 1; it's the ability to reason.
But what do we do if our System 1 thinks everything looks bleak next year and our System 2 agrees?
"My System 1 also says it is going to be a bad year," Mr. Kahneman said.
But feeling that does not equate to shunning the market. "I'm not really sure that the situation is very different from what it usually is," he said. "The same advice about prudence that would carry you in other years would carry you in next year."
(His greater concern is with what the last three years have done to the general sense of optimism among the young. "That's a profound change," he said. "Where that will go, what shape that will take I cannot predict.")
Practicing a prudent strategy is tougher than it sounds, particularly given the extremes of the last five years. To go from housing and stock markets that were always going up to a housing market that is bumping along the bottom and a stock market that goes up and down seemingly at random is tough to take.
Daniel Egan, head of behavioral finance for the Americas at Barclays Wealth, said that from Jan. 1 to Aug. 1 the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index moved up or down at least 2 percent on 8 percent of trading days. From Aug. 1 to Dec. 20 that number more than tripled, with 27 percent of trading days having moves greater than 2 percent one way or the other. And 13 percent of the days in the second period had swings greater than 3 percent, compared with none in the first period.
"This is the worst kind of environment to attempt market timing in," Mr. Egan said. "Odds are, you'll miss the rally when one or more uncertainties -- euro, U.S. fiscal policy, U.S. election -- resolves itself, leaving you with the volatility but not the return you'd hoped for."
SIZING THINGS UP One thing behavioral research has shown is that people who lose a lot of money in a particular asset class will often shun it or at least underweight it as an investment in the future.
"Individuals who got burned by T-bills in the 1970s and were burned by inflation underweighted T-bills the rest of their lives," Mr. Egan said. "2008 being a credit crisis, people are going to have an experiential prejudice against banks for the losses they experienced."
He added that people who believed real estate was an investment that would always go up were likely to have similar biases.
Assessing these objectively will be crucial for investors who want to make reasoned decisions. Meir Statman, professor of finance at Santa Clara University, said investors needed to step back and think about how the fear of losing even more money was directing their decisions.
"Fear makes us think the world is coming to an end; it makes us think that stocks will never go up and always go down," he said. "This is where logic is going to have to intrude."
One helpful tip from Michael Mauboussin, chief investment strategist at Legg Mason Capital Management and the author of "Think Twice: Harnessing the Power of Counterintuition" (Harvard Business Press), was to assess the experts providing the advice and understand the likelihood that their predictions will be right.
"In some realms, experts will predict very well," Mr. Mauboussin said. "If you turn on the weather, you can be sure if you need an umbrella. When we're dealing with economic, political and social areas, we cannot predict as well."
Robert Seaberg, managing director of planning services at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, advocates that people be a bit more realistic in their thinking about investments.
"The world now is more about risk management than about investing," Mr. Seaberg said. "Forget the home runs. Guard against the really big losses, and go for singles and doubles. You win more games than you lose."
ACTION OR INACTION The collective wisdom of this group is almost entirely to take the long view and stay the course next year.
"My advice to individual people is the less attention you pay to this stuff, the better you are going to be," Mr. Mauboussin said. "You need to have a prudent strategy, a risk tolerance and a time horizon and then don't get too caught up in it."
Of course, the long horizon sounds great if you are at the beginning of it. If you are among the baby boomers in retirement or about to be there soon you may scoff at this. But Mr. Statman, who turns 65 this year, said the last thing people of his generation needed to do was try to find a way to get their money back. They need to live with less.
"The saddest stories I read about are of baby boomers trying to recover their losses by going into risky investments, and they end up in Ponzi schemes or very miserable positions," he said.
As for Mr. Kahneman, he has no plans of adjusting a strategy that has served him well. "I made one big decision, which was how much I want to have in equities and how important it was for me to be protected from inflation," he said. "Then I leave it to other people. I don't even want to know how things are going day to day."
If it's good enough for a Nobel laureate, it might be good enough for you.

Abstract: "Cars 2" was still a hit by Hollywood standards -- it generated $552 million in worldwide box-office revenue -- but it turned out to be the worst-performing Pixar film ever, adjusted for inflation. After saying his dealership was "close to death" during the financial crisis, David Kelleher, president of David Dodge Chrysler Jeep in Glen Mills, Pa., told me in July that he was cautiously optimistic about Chrysler under its new leadership from Fiat.

Full text: Count the T-Mobile lawyers who negotiated a multibillion-dollar breakup fee -- Adam Emmerich and Steven Cohen of Wachtell, Lipton Rosen & Katz -- and got AT&T to agree to it as among those who will actually deserve their year-end bonuses.
This week AT&T threw in the towel on its doomed effort to buy T-Mobile after promising T-Mobile's owner, Deutsche Telekom, $3 billion in cash plus valuable wireless spectrum if the merger failed on antitrust grounds, which, predictably, it did. As for AT&T's chief executive, Randall Stephenson, AT&T's lawyers and the AT&T board, which ultimately bear responsibility, I'm not holding my breath that any of them will be held accountable for this $4 billion error in judgment.
But let's save a discussion of crony capitalism for next year. It's Christmas Eve, and the failure of AT&T's $39 billion bid, the biggest deal of 2011, was just one of many developments on subjects I wrote about this year, from the gathering chill in social networking public offerings to the fall of Italy's prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi. This week I went back to some of the people and companies who appeared in my columns to find out how they've fared.

"Cars 2" was released in June to a critical drubbing unprecedented for a Pixar film. It also raised the specter that the quirky independence that had spawned such beloved classics as the "Toy Story" franchise, "Ratatouille" and "Up" had been extinguished by the heavy hand of Disney, which bought Pixar in 2006. "Cars 2" was still a hit by Hollywood standards -- it generated $552 million in worldwide box-office revenue -- but it turned out to be the worst-performing Pixar film ever, adjusted for inflation.
But there are encouraging signs emanating from Pixar's headquarters in Emeryville, Calif. "This is not an executive-led studio," John Lasseter, chief creative officer for Pixar and Disney Animation, told Brooks Barnes, a reporter for The New York Times, this summer. Mr. Lasseter stressed that "it's not true" that "Cars 2" was influenced by Disney ownership and "my deepest desire is to entertain people by making great movies."
More fundamentally, Pixar's next big film is "Brave," set for a June 22, 2012, release. "Brave" is a fairy tale (Pixar's first) set in 10th-century Scotland with a girl as the protagonist. It's not a sequel and, unlike "Cars 2," has no obvious merchandising tie-ins (unless it unleashes a mania for girls' bow and arrow sets). Also in development are a dinosaur film premised on the idea that they never became extinct, and a story set inside the human mind.
The movie "Brave," said Doug Creutz, an analyst at Cowen & Company, "certainly appears to be a return to creative risk-taking in terms of the subject matter. It's important to look at Pixar's output in the context of generally declining trends in animated box office as competition has gotten more intense. Pixar may have to work even harder, particularly on nonsequels, to deliver the kind of returns that had been normal for their films. I think there's a lot riding on that film, more than normal, given the crosscurrents in the film business in general and the animation business in particular, the issues with 'Cars 2,' and the importance of Pixar to Disney."

After saying his dealership was "close to death" during the financial crisis, David Kelleher, president of David Dodge Chrysler Jeep in Glen Mills, Pa., told me in July that he was cautiously optimistic about Chrysler under its new leadership from Fiat. When I called this week, he was too busy closing sales to come to the phone.
In October, Chrysler reported third-quarter profit of $212 million on a 24 percent surge in sales, in contrast to a loss of $84 million a year ago, and predicted a full-year profit. Many parts of the economy may be hurting, but the rejuvenated American auto industry is thriving. That is filtering down from Detroit to local economies across the country -- an unqualified success for the Bush and Obama administrations' controversial rescue mission.
This week a buoyant Mr. Kelleher told me that his dealership had its first 100-vehicle sales month in September since 2007, a feat it repeated in October and November. His dealership is on track to do even better this month. "Our Jeep sales have been red-hot," he reported, and the updated Chrysler 300 "is coming on strong." He said he just ordered as many 300s as he could get. Chrysler "is producing flat out," he said, "and they're selling everything they can make."
On Sunday Mr. Kelleher hosted a Christmas brunch with a visit from Santa at the Concord Country Club for his employees and their families. He sent gift baskets to every employee's home and organized a toy drive that delivered over 200 toys to needy children. He handed out Christmas bonuses a week early. "This is my first Christmas party in four years," Mr. Kelleher said. "We used to do it, and I missed being able to do that. This year was such a recovery. Our people worked so hard. People went through some tough years. Let me tell you, I'm in the Christmas spirit like I've never been before."

Hewlett-Packard may have cinched the title for most dysfunctional board ever this year after it first hired Leo Apotheker as chief executive without the full board's bothering to meet him, and then summarily fired him with a severance package that amounted to $25.4 million for 11 months of management turmoil. Meg Whitman, a board member and former eBay chief executive, stepped into the crisis as H.P.'s new chief executive in September. She quickly reversed Mr. Apotheker's ill-advised decision (made with board approval) to consider abandoning H.P.'s personal computer division, an all-too-rare admission of a strategic mistake. "We had a C.E.O. change, strategic shifts and many new cycles," she conceded last month, all of which she characterized as "distractions."
H.P. also took a bold step by corporate standards to limit severance pay for executives who were terminated for poor performance or without cause. H.P.'s board in November approved a plan that requires executives to give up stock and option grants that haven't yet vested at the time of their exit. Ms. Whitman herself will be subject to the restrictions, which would have reduced Mr. Apotheker's bloated pay by approximately $3.6 million.
So far, Ms. Whitman has been refreshingly direct. "We need to be simpler, clearer and more consistent -- no more surprises," Ms. Whitman told analysts in November. "We need to articulate a clear direction, from business strategy to financial strategy to capital allocation strategy. The executive team is hard at work on this. One thing we do know is that we're getting back to the basics of executing business fundamentals, which, frankly, we struggled with in F.Y. '11."

Can things get any worse for hedge fund king John Paulson, once called "the man with the Midas touch," who earned $15 billion for his funds, including $5 billion for himself, by betting against the United States mortgage market? Evidently. Investors reported this month that Mr. Paulson's funds were down again in November. The flagship Advantage Fund dropped another 3 percent, bringing its losses year-to-date to 32 percent, and his Advantage Plus fund was down 3.6 percent, or 46 percent, for the year. Even Mr. Paulson's once-successful bet on gold has soured, as gold prices have fallen from a peak of more than $1,900 an ounce in September to just over $1,600 this week.
In a letter to investors in October, Mr. Paulson apologized for the worst performance in the firm's history, conceded he had been "overoptimistic" and said he'd learned from the experience. But if he has a new strategy, he hasn't revealed it publicly. And his Sept. 30 regulatory filings indicate he actually increased his holdings in Bank of America, one of the financial stocks that hurt his performance this year. This week, Bank of America slid to a new low of under $5. (Mr. Paulson didn't respond to requests for comment.)
One bright spot for Mr. Paulson is that many of his clients appear to be sticking with him, guaranteeing that he will remain one of Wall Street's richest men (since he's paid a flat 2 percent of assets under management in good times and bad). And in just another week, he can close the books on 2011 and start a new year with a clean slate.

In Omaha, Anthony Hardwick, the 29-year-old Target employee who organized a nationwide protest against early store openings on Thanksgiving, doesn't need to worry about working on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day -- or many other days, either.
After being asked by Target to report to work by 11 p.m. on Thanksgiving, Mr. Hardwick organized a protest on the Web site Change.org and emerged as an unlikely hero of the save-Thanksgiving movement. But since then Mr. Hardwick's hours as a shopping cart attendant have dwindled, and although he's considered a full-time employee, he's paid by the hour. "I've only worked two shifts since Thanksgiving," he told me when I called this week.
"I feel pretty unique, because most people at Target are working themselves to the bone during the holiday season," he said. "I watch the swap board, and if someone doesn't want to work, I offer to take it, or I pester my supervisor." But he's only gotten "four or five hours here and there, whenever I can pick up a shift."
Mr. Hardwick said Target had not told him why he wasn't getting more hours, but "shoppers were recognizing me and stopping and wanting to talk, so I think they thought I was kind of a distraction," he said. Now that the media attention has died down, he's hoping for more hours and said he was eager to get back to work. (He's still working his second job at OfficeMax.)
Suffice it to say that this is not Target's version of events. When I contacted the company this week, a spokeswoman bristled at any idea that Target was retaliating against an employee for speaking his mind. "Mr. Hardwick accepted a full-time job with another retailer at the beginning of October and adjusted his Target schedule to allow him to work one-two evening shifts a week," Target said in a statement. "Since that time, he has consistently been scheduled for those shifts. There has been absolutely no change to the hours he is receiving."
Mr. Hardwick responded: "That's just not true." He said he took the OfficeMax position in September. "It's certainly convenient that it was only after this hubbub that they cut me back," he said. "I was working 20 to 30 hours a week with Target. I was pulling 60 to 70 hours a week between the two jobs. I was making good money." Mr. Hardwick said he filed an availability form with Target "that says I'll work open-to-close seven days a week."
Whatever Mr. Hardwick's future with Target, he said he'd still start his petition if he had to do it all over again. "I've been thinking hard about the next steps, taking the voice that I was given and try to make that a permanent thing," he said. "How can I empower people I work with, and people in retail, and the service industry generally?"

Full text: Eight states will ring in the New Year with a higher minimum wage, under state laws that require wage floors to keep apace with inflation. San Francisco, one of the few cities that sets its own minimum wage above the federal level, is also raising wages for the lowest-paid workers in the new year. It will become the first big city in the country to require companies to pay their workers more than $10 an hour.
The minimum wage increases in Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Montana, Ohio, Oregon, Vermont and Washington will be 28 cents to 37 cents an hour, according to the National Employment Law Project. That is an extra $582 to $770 a year for a full-time minimum wage worker, and resets these states' minimum wages to $7.64 to $9.04 an hour.
At that higher end is Washington State, which will become the first state in the nation to set its minimum wage above $9 an hour. For reference, the federal wage floor for most workers is $7.25 an hour.
About one million minimum-wage workers will be affected by increases in the eight states, according to the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal research organization. An additional 400,000 workers who make just above minimum wage will also most likely get a raise because many employers adjust their pay distribution for all employees when there is a new minimum.
Most of the minimum-wage workers affected in these states are women, over the age of 20 and white, according to the institute's analysis of Labor Department data.
A national minimum wage was first enacted during the Great Depression and has been raised sporadically by Congress rather than being automatically indexed to price changes. Adjusting for inflation, the federal wage floor was highest in 1968.
The eight states, as well as 10 others and the District of Columbia and a handful of cities, however, have set an even higher wage floor, which in many cases is indexed to consumer price increases. How that floor changes, and when, depends on the state. Labor organizers are planning additional minimum wage campaigns in several other states next year, according to the National Employment Law Project.
The broader economic effects of raising the minimum wage are disputed.
Some economists argue that raising the cost of labor will actually hurt low-wage workers because employers will decide to hire fewer people. Others say the increased spending power of low-wage workers will create jobs to support added demand.
It is not clear that employers will actually offset the cost of higher wages by employing fewer workers. Some economists say they believe that these higher labor costs might be passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices for goods and services, and that employers might also just accept a smaller profit margin when wages rise.
A landmark 1994 study by David Card and Alan Krueger, who is now the chairman of President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, found that raising the minimum wage did not lower employment in a case study of a local fast-food industry.
Dozens of similar studies, looking at a variety of locations and industries, have been published since then, and the results have run the gamut.
For example, a study of San Francisco airport employees, conducted in 2004 by economists at the University of California, Berkeley and the University of Waterloo, also found that increasing wages did not lower employment, and instead reduced employee turnover. But a literature review of a variety of studies published around the same time came to the opposite conclusion.
Whatever the effect on total employment, for those workers who do receive raises in the new year, the added income still will not be enough to push their families above the poverty line.

Jobless Claims Drop, but 3rd-Quarter Growth Is Revised Down

Full text: WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- New claims for unemployment benefits dropped last week to the lowest level in more than three and a half years, suggesting that the labor market recovery was gaining speed.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 364,000, the Labor Department said on Thursday. That was the lowest number since April 2008.
In other economic news, a survey released on Thursday showed that consumer sentiment rose in December to its highest level in six months. And a gauge of future economic activity increased more than expected in November because of a sharp pickup in new permits to build homes.
But revised data showed that the nation's economic growth was slower than previously estimated in the third quarter because of a sharp drop in health care spending. Stronger business investment and a fall in inventories pointed to a pickup in output in the current period.
The United States economy has shown signs it is gaining steam as the year ends, although the recovery still could be derailed by any big flare-up in Europe's debt crisis.
JOBLESS CLAIMS The decline in jobless claims last week was a more positive development than expected. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims rising to 375,000 last week.
The previous week's jobless claims data was revised up to 368,000 from the previously reported 366,000.
The level of unemployment claims has fallen in recent weeks, and analysts say fewer layoffs means employers are probably more likely to hire.
Economists at Goldman Sachs said earlier in the week that weekly claims below 435,000 pointed to net monthly gains in jobs. Their research was based on figures available through October.
In November, the jobless rate dropped to a two-and-a-half-year low of 8.6 percent. The Federal Reserve last week acknowledged an improvement in the jobs market, but said unemployment remained high and left the door open for further measures to help the economy.
ECONOMIC OUTPUT In a report released on Thursday, the Commerce Department said in its final estimate that gross domestic product grew at a 1.8 percent annual rate in the July-September quarter, down from the previously estimated 2 percent.
Economists had expected growth to be unrevised at 2 percent. Though spending on health care dropped by $2.2 billion, spending on durable goods was stronger than previously estimated, indicating that the household appetite to consume remained healthy.
A previous report said that health care spending increased at a $19.7 billion rate. Health care spending subtracted about 0.1 of a percentage point from the G.D.P. change in the final revision, whereas in the previous estimate, it added 0.61 of a percentage point to growth.
Despite the downward revision, the third-quarter growth is still a step up from the April-June period's 1.3 percent pace. Part of the pickup in output during the last quarter reflected a reversal of factors that held back growth earlier in the year.
A jump in gasoline prices weighed on consumer spending earlier in the year, and supply disruptions from Japan's big earthquake and tsunami in March curbed auto production.
The government revised consumer spending to a 1.7 percent growth rate from 2.3 percent because of adjustments to health care services, in particular nonprofit hospitals.
Spending on durable goods was, however, revised up to a 5.7 percent pace from 5.5 percent.
Business inventories dropped by $2 billion, which sliced 1.35 percentage points from G.D.P. growth. Inventories previously were estimated to have declined $8.5 billion.
The drag from inventories was offset by strong business spending, which increased at a 15.7 percent rate, instead of 14.8 percent.
CONSUMER SENTIMENT In a fresh sign of economic hope, a survey released Thursday showed that Thomson Reuters University of Michigan's final reading on the overall index on consumer sentiment rose to 69.9 points in December from 64.1 the previous month.
It topped the median forecast of 68 points among economists polled by Reuters and beat December's preliminary figure of 67.7.
Over all, real spending is expected to increase by 1.8 percent in 2012 as long as action is taken on extending the payroll tax cut, the survey said.
The survey's barometer of current economic conditions rose to 79.6 points from 77.6, while the survey's gauge of consumer expectations gained to 63.6 points, from 55.4. All three indexes were at their highest level since June.
"I think it's a reflection of improving job statistics, we're seeing an increase in retail sales and even housing seems to be going up," said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank in Chicago. "A lot of the key bookends of our economy appear to be really strengthening and that's supporting confidence."
LEADING INDICATORS A report released Thursday by the Conference Board suggested that economic momentum could increase by spring.
The private firm's Leading Economic Index rose 0.5 percent in November to 118 points, following a 0.9 percent increase in October. It was the seventh consecutive monthly gain in the index.
"The risk of an economic downturn in the near term has receded," said Ataman Ozyildirim, an economist at the Conference Board.
Ken Goldstein, another Conference Board economist, said the index suggested the economy could pick up steam by spring.
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected the index to rise 0.3 percent in November.

Full text: After long resisting the kind of financial force Washington used at the height of the financial crisis in 2008, European central bankers on Wednesday pumped nearly $640 billion into the Continent's banking system. The move raised hopes that the money could alleviate the region's credit squeeze.
Though it is too soon to gauge any longer-term benefits, the move, by the European Central Bank, could be a turning point in the Continent's debt crisis -- a cascading problem that for nearly two years has plagued financial markets around the world and now threatens global economic growth.
American officials and global economists have long urged the Europe's central bank to take just such an aggressive stance -- even as European political leaders have repeatedly failed to devise concrete near-term plans to address Europe's debt problems and deteriorating finances.
Carl B. Weinberg, chief economist at the consulting firm High Frequency Economics and a professed bear on the European outlook, said he was stunned by the size of the monetary operation, saying it suggested that Europe's central bank had "shown a path toward averting catastrophic collapse in Europe."
Indeed, some analysts suggest the central bank's new lending program represents a kind of back door to the easy-money policy pursued by the Federal Reserve after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, which is widely credited with averting a broader economic disaster.
The three-year loans the central bank made Wednesday come with a bargain-basement interest rate of 1 percent, providing the region's financial institutions with the kind of cheap financing they can no longer get from the market. Among other requirements, Europe's banks need the money to refinance about a trillion dollars in loans that mature in 2012. Wednesday's infusion could also help reduce the pressure on beleaguered government borrowers on the periphery of the Continent, most significantly Italy and Spain. Those countries have not been able to directly tap European Central Bank funds, even as investors are increasingly reluctant to finance those countries' debt by buying their bonds.
Now, though, by lending to commercial banks at such low rates for three years, the central bank might induce them to use some of the newly available money to buy shorter-term government bonds, which have higher yields, or interest rates. Spain's two-year government bond, for example, is currently yielding 3.64 percent.
Mario Draghi, the central bank's new president, has resisted calls to stand directly behind debtor governments by buying their bonds as necessary, without limit. But the volume of money pumped into the system on Wednesday suggested that Mr. Draghi was prepared to indirectly support those governments through their nation's commercial banks.
"This is exactly what happened in the United States with the Fed in 2008," said Mr. Weinberg, the economist. By buying up bad loans and other impaired assets, and lending money to the banks, government officials in the United States were able to buy time for American banks to strengthen their depleted balance sheets.
But in the current case, European officials confront an even trickier situation. Not only must the banks borrow, but indebted European governments have huge borrowing needs of their own, totaling 1.1 trillion euros ($1.4 trillion) in 2012.
Despite those twin threats, German political leaders have opposed any outright bailout either for the banking system or for troubled government borrowers like Italy and Spain, whose free-spending ways have long irked voters in Germany, Europe's largest economy and a principal financier of any bailouts.
If it works, the quiet virtue of the European Central Bank's new lending program will be that it helped buttress banks while easing the pressure on governments -- without the appearance of a direct rescue.
Although the program did not take effect until this week, it was announced on Dec. 8 as part of a broader series of European Central Bank efforts to stabilize anxious credit markets. The central bank said it would offer three-year loans -- rather than the one-year limit it had previously imposed -- and would accept a wider variety of financial assets as collateral, to make it easier for banks to qualify for the loans.
The central bank is accepting the banks' outstanding loans as security, a measure meant to help smaller community banks that might lack conventional forms of collateral like bonds.
"In many ways, it was a success," said Nicolas Veron, a senior fellow at Bruegel, a research organization in Brussels. "But it exposes the E.C.B. to risks linked to the banks because no one knows the quality of the collateral they are providing."
Until Wednesday's announcement, it was not known how many banks would apply for the new loans or how much they would borrow.
In the end, 523 banks tapped the new program, borrowing 489.2 billion euros, well above the 300 billion euro estimate that market experts had been predicting. Though some of that money includes funds earmarked to replace existing loans, economists estimate that Wednesday's action could inject 190 billion to 270 billion euros, as much as $353 billion, of new money into the European financial system.
The large number of banks that participated is also an indicator that the program has avoided the kind of welfare stigma attached to other types of rescue packages. Because the central bank does not reveal the borrowers' identities, it is not known exactly which banks participated. But Italian banks including UniCredit and Intesa Sanpaolo borrowed a significant amount, a total of 116 billion euros among them, according to Reuters.
"This is as good as it gets for the banks," said Gilles Moec, co-head of economic research for Deutsche Bank. "It's a big deal."
He said one crucial test of whether the new approach could address the bigger challenge of easing borrowing conditions for governments would come in February, when Italy has 46 billion euros worth of debt coming due. That same month, the European Central Bank plans to offer banks another round of three-year loans.
Mr. Draghi, despite his earlier opposition to channeling the central bank's loans into government coffers, acknowledged in a speech Monday to the European Parliament that commercial banks might end up doing just that with their new, cheap money. "We don't know how many government bonds they are going to buy," he said.
Strong demand at recent Spanish debt auctions have driven down yields, suggesting that banks were loading up on the debt to use as collateral for the central bank loans, analysts said. But there are limits to their appetites for governments' debt at a time when the banks are trying to reduce their vulnerability to a potential debt default by a big country like Italy, while also protecting themselves against the possibility of a breakup of the euro currency union if the 17 member nation's cannot resolve the crisis.
Pumping new money into an economy is often seen as a textbook ingredient for inflation, if it leads to easy credit for businesses and consumers and a resultant spending spree. But that prospect is widely considered unlikely, at least initially, because Europe appears headed for an economic downturn. A weak economy will discourage much private borrowing.
Mr. Moec said the risk of higher inflation was minimal because "that would require that the banks were actually making loans to the private sector, and we think that's going to take a while."

Full text: CORRECTION APPENDED
Iran's currency, the rial, tumbled in value to its lowest level ever against the dollar on Tuesday in panic selling caused in part by the country's increased economic isolation from international sanctions, an unbridled inflation problem and worries that government officials there are ideologically incapable of devising a workable solution.
The rial's value has been weakening for months, but the traumatic drop on Tuesday reflected what Iranian economists called a new level of economic anxiety in the country, exacerbated by conflicting information coming out of the Tehran hierarchy that reinforced a sense of indecision and confusion.
A report in Iran's state-run news media that the government had decided to suspend trading relations with the United Arab Emirates in retaliation for that country's support of American sanctions on Iran -- denied later by Iran's vice president -- apparently contributed to a rush by Iranian merchants and trading companies to sell their rials for other currencies. The United Arab Emirates is a major gateway for Iran's exports.
"This is the most serious financial crisis they've faced, with multiple things coming to a head," said Djavad Salehi-Isfahani, a professor of economics at Virginia Tech and an authority on Iran's economy. "I have the feeling that really nobody is in charge of economic policy, nobody who can quickly think on their feet."
By day's end, Iran's Fars News Agency was reporting that it cost 15,150 rials to buy one dollar in Tehran, compared with 13,400 rials to the dollar a few days earlier. In late October, it cost about 12,500 rials to buy one dollar in the capital city, which means the Iranian currency has plunged in value by about 20 percent against the dollar in the past few months.
The currency crisis could hardly come at a worse time for Iran, which has been pummeled economically by the cumulative effects of four rounds of United Nations Security Council sanctions, as well as sanctions imposed by the United States, Canada and the European Union over the country's suspect nuclear energy program.
An increasing number of international companies are no longer willing to engage in new business with Iran; the European Union has talked about imposing a boycott on Iran's oil, its major export; and the Obama administration is expected to enact a harsh law soon that could severely penalize banks in friendly countries that do business with Iran's Central Bank. Officials in Iran have spoken more frankly in recent days about the destructive impact of Iran's isolation.
The United States Treasury Department added to the pain on Tuesday, putting 10 companies based in Malta on a blacklist for acting as front companies for the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines, which has already been blacklisted. The Treasury said in statement that it took the action because the Iranian shipping line and its subsidiaries "have increasingly relied upon multiple front companies and agents to overcome the impact of U.S. and international sanctions and increased scrutiny of their behavior."
The rial's loss in value partly reflects the impact of a stubborn inflation problem in Iran, caused in part by the government's phasing out of subsidies for fuel and other staples that has caused prices to rise sharply. To cushion the impact on Iranian consumers, the government distributed cash payments, which in some ways worsened the inflation problem by increasing the supply of rials in Iran. Iran's official news media have said the inflation rate was about 20 percent, although outside estimates were higher.
Economists said the Iran government is hampered in its ability to control inflation partly because of Islamic prohibitions on charging interest, which prevents banks from offering attractive rates that would encourage Iranians to keep their money in savings accounts. Such a step would take money out of circulation.
Some said the catalyst on Tuesday for the panic selling of rials in Iran was an announcement carried by the semiofficial Mehr News Agency that Iran had temporarily stopped imports from the United Arab Emirates "as a punitive measure" because its government had expressed support for the Western sanctions.
Later in the day, Vice President Mohammad-Reza Rahimi was quoted by Mehr as saying that the earlier announcement was an overstatement, and that Iran had only issued a warning because "the U.A.E. has done something, under the pressure of America, which does not hurt Iran but hurts itself." He was further quoted as exhorting the Emirates leaders to "not succumb to American pressure."
Correction: December 22, 2011, Thursday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Wednesday about a plunge in the value of Iran's currency, the rial, caused in part by reports that Iran had suspended trade relations with the United Arab Emirates, quoted incorrectly from a statement by Iran's vice president, Mohammad-Reza Rahimi, in which he warned the United Arab Emirates against supporting American sanctions against Iran. Mr. Rahimi said such support "does not hurt Iran but hurts itself." He did not say "does not hurt the U.S. but hurts itself."
Correction: December 26, 2011, Monday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Wednesday about a plunge in the value of the rial, Iran's currency, to a historic low of 15,150 to the dollar, misstated its exchange rate against the dollar in late October and its decline in percentage terms since then. It cost about 12,500 rials to buy a dollar in late October, not 7,000, which means it has declined by about 20 percent in value against the dollar since then, not "more than 50 percent."

Don't Tax the Rich. Tax Inequality Itself.

Abstract: If the average 1-percenter made more than 36 times the income of the median American household, then the I.R.S. would create a new tax bracket for the highest 1 percent of income and calculate a marginal income tax rate for that bracket sufficient to reduce the after-tax Brandeis ratio to 36.

Full text: THE progressive reformer and eminent jurist Louis D. Brandeis once said, "We may have democracy, or we may have wealth concentrated in the hands of a few, but we cannot have both." Brandeis lived at a time when enormous disparities between the rich and the poor led to violent labor unrest and ultimately to a reform movement.
Over the last three decades, income inequality has again soared to the sort of levels that alarmed Brandeis. In 1980, the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans made 9.1 percent of our nation's pre-tax income; by 2006 that share had risen to 18.8 percent -- slightly higher than when Brandeis joined the Supreme Court in 1916.
Congress might have countered this increased concentration but, instead, tax changes have exacerbated the trend: in after-tax dollars, our wealthiest 1 percent over this same period went from receiving 7.7 percent to 16.3 percent of our nation's income.
What we call the Brandeis Ratio -- the ratio of the average income of the nation's richest 1 percent to the median household income -- has skyrocketed since Ronald Reagan took office. In 1980 the average 1-percenter made 12.5 times the median income, but in 2006 (the latest year for which data is available) the average income of our richest 1 percent was a whopping 36 times greater than that of the median household.
Brandeis understood that at some point the concentration of economic power could undermine the democratic requisite of dispersed political power. This concern looms large in today's America, where billionaires are allowed to spend unlimited amounts of money on their own campaigns or expressly advocating the election of others.
We believe that we have reached the Brandeis tipping point. It would be bad for our democracy if 1-percenters started making 40 or 50 times as much as the median American.
Enough is enough. Congress should reform our tax law to put the brakes on further inequality. Specifically, we propose an automatic extra tax on the income of the top 1 percent of earners -- a tax that would limit the after-tax incomes of this club to 36 times the median household income.
Importantly, our Brandeis tax does not target excessive income per se; it only caps inequality. Billionaires could double their current income without the tax kicking in -- as long as the median income also doubles. The sky is the limit for the rich as long as the "rising tide lifts all boats." Indeed, the tax gives job creators an extra reason to make sure that corporate wealth does in fact trickle down.
Here's how the tax would work. Once a year, the Internal Revenue Service would calculate the Brandeis ratio of the previous year. If the average 1-percenter made more than 36 times the income of the median American household, then the I.R.S. would create a new tax bracket for the highest 1 percent of income and calculate a marginal income tax rate for that bracket sufficient to reduce the after-tax Brandeis ratio to 36.
This new tax, if triggered, would apply only to income in excess of the poorest 1-percenter -- currently about $330,000 per year. Our Brandeis tax is conservative in that it doesn't attempt to reverse the gains of the wealthy in the last 30 years. It is not a "claw back" tax. It merely assures that things don't get worse.
A key aspect of our proposal is the tax's automatic nature. Congress need only act once to protect our future. Just as our tax brackets automatically adjust with the inflation rate, Congress could specify nondiscretionary conditions under which the Brandeis tax would automatically go into effect.
Part of our goal is to change the way politicians speak about income equality. Framing the income of the wealthy in relation to the median income will help us all keep in mind the relative success of the middle class. Our grandparents would be shocked to learn that the average income of the 1-percent club has skyrocketed to more than 30 times the median income -- just as we will be shocked if 20 years from now 1-percenters make 80 times the median, which is where we will be if inequality continues to grow at the current rate unabated.
The Occupy Wall Street movement is right to decry the increasing power of the 1 percent as a threat to democracy. President Obama is right to characterize the present as a "make-or-break moment" for the middle class. As 1-percenters ourselves, we call on Congress, for the sake of democracy, to end the continued erosion of economic equality in our nation.

Full text: Apparently the desperate search of Republicans for someone they can nominate not named Willard M. Romney continues. New polls suggest that in Iowa, at least, we have already passed peak Gingrich. Next up: Representative Ron Paul.
In a way, that makes sense. Mr. Romney isn't trusted because he's seen as someone who cynically takes whatever positions he thinks will advance his career -- a charge that sticks because it's true. Mr. Paul, by contrast, has been highly consistent. I bet you won't find video clips from a few years back in which he says the opposite of what he's saying now.
Unfortunately, Mr. Paul has maintained his consistency by ignoring reality, clinging to his ideology even as the facts have demonstrated that ideology's wrongness. And, even more unfortunately, Paulist ideology now dominates a Republican Party that used to know better.
I'm not talking here about Mr. Paul's antiwar views or his less well-known views on civil and reproductive rights, which would horrify liberals who think of him as a good guy. I'm talking, instead, about his views on economics.
Mr. Paul identifies himself as a believer in "Austrian" economics -- a doctrine that it goes without saying rejects John Maynard Keynes but is almost equally vehement in rejecting the ideas of Milton Friedman. For Austrians see "fiat money," money that is just printed without being backed by gold, as the root of all economic evil, which means that they fiercely oppose the kind of monetary expansion Friedman claimed could have prevented the Great Depression -- and which was actually carried out by Ben Bernanke this time around.
O.K., a brief digression: the Federal Reserve doesn't actually print money (the Treasury does that). But the Fed does control the "monetary base," the sum of bank reserves and currency in circulation. So when people talk about Mr. Bernanke printing money, what they really mean is that the Fed expanded the monetary base.
And there has, indeed, been a huge expansion of the monetary base. After Lehman Brothers fell, the Fed began lending large sums to banks as well as buying a wide range of other assets, in a (successful) attempt to stabilize financial markets, in the process adding large amounts to bank reserves. In the fall of 2010, the Fed began another round of purchases, in a less successful attempt to boost economic growth. The combined effect of these actions was that the monetary base more than tripled in size.
Austrians, and for that matter many right-leaning economists, were sure about what would happen as a result: There would be devastating inflation. One popular Austrian commentator who has advised Mr. Paul, Peter Schiff, even warned (on Glenn Beck's TV show) of the possibility of Zimbabwe-style hyperinflation in the near future.
So here we are, three years later. How's it going? Inflation has fluctuated, but, at the end of the day, consumer prices have risen just 4.5 percent, meaning an average annual inflation rate of only 1.5 percent. Who could have predicted that printing so much money would cause so little inflation? Well, I could. And did. And so did others who understood the Keynesian economics Mr. Paul reviles. But Mr. Paul's supporters continue to claim, somehow, that he has been right about everything.
Still, while the original proponents of the doctrine won't ever admit that they were wrong -- my experience is that nobody in the political world ever admits to having been wrong about anything -- you might think that having been so completely off-base about something so central to their belief system would have caused the Austrians to lose popularity, even within the G.O.P. After all, as recently as the Bush years, many Republicans were all for printing money when the economy slumps. "Aggressive monetary policy can reduce the depth of a recession," declared the 2004 Economic Report of the President.
What has happened instead, however, is that hard-money doctrine and paranoia about inflation have taken over the party, even as the predicted inflation keeps failing to materialize. For example, in February, Representative Paul Ryan, who is somewhat inexplicably regarded as the party's deep thinker on matters economic, harangued Mr. Bernanke on how terrible it is to "debase" a currency and pointed to a rise in commodity prices in late 2010 and early 2011 as evidence that inflation was finally coming. Commodity prices have plunged since then, but there is no sign that Mr. Ryan or anyone else is having second thoughts.
Now, it's still very unlikely that Ron Paul will become president. But, as I said, his economic doctrine has, in effect, become the official G.O.P. line, despite having been proved utterly wrong by events. And what will happen if that doctrine actually ends up being put into action? Great Depression, here we come.

Retail Sales Rose Slightly in November

Full text: WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- Retail sales grew at their slowest pace in five months in November, tempering expectations for a strong holiday shopping season.
Retail sales increased 0.2 percent after gaining 0.6 percent in October, a Commerce Department report showed on Tuesday.
Relatively strong consumer spending in recent months has helped the United States resist a global slowdown fed by Europe's still menacing debt crisis.
A separate report showed business inventories rose in October by the most in five months, pointing to stronger growth as companies restock shelves to meet consumer demand.
November's retail sales growth, which was lower than analysts had expected, looked unlikely to rekindle fears of an imminent recession, and the Federal Reserve on Tuesday announced no major policy shifts. The Fed did, however, say financial market turmoil posed a threat to economic growth.
Some economists warned that some of the strength in American consumption has come from households saving less, a trend that might not last, and the retail data suggested some of that strength might already be waning.
The modest rise could "be the start of a period in which households start to spend more within their means," said Paul Dales, an economist with Capital Economics in London.
Receipts for motor vehicles and parts helped the overall increase, rising 0.5 percent. Excluding autos, sales rose just 0.2 percent.
One factor weighing on consumers, analysts said, was a substantial drop in household wealth so far this year. Big drops in the stock market during the third quarter led household wealth to contract $2.4 trillion, Fed data showed last week.
Another constraint on spending has been weak growth in after-tax incomes, which have failed to keep up with inflation.
In November, sales at food and beverage stores fell 0.2 percent, while receipts at gasoline stations dropped 0.1 percent.
Still, shoppers swarmed into stores over the Thanksgiving weekend, traditionally retailing's biggest sales period. Reports of a strong weekend performance had fed optimism about the outlook for holiday spending.
Some of the weakness in the November retail sales might be because stores discounted heavily to attract customers, said Millan Mulraine, a senior United States macro strategist at TD Securities in New York.
"It's fairly disappointing given that all the evidence was pointing to fairly strong gains during the month," Mr. Mulraine said.
Some details within the retail report were more encouraging. Sales outside autos, gasoline and building materials -- which correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of the government's gross domestic product report -- rose 0.3 percent in November.
Also positive for the growth outlook, a survey showed small businesses grew more confident in the economy's future in November, a third straight month of improvement.

Full text: With Christmas less than two weeks away, the toy industry has no runaway hit -- leaving many toy shoppers bored and complicating how stores sell holiday inventory.
"We are not seeing people clamor for any single item," Stephanie Lucy, vice president for toys at Target, said by e-mail.
The hitless season has retailers stocking less, leaning on classic items rather than new ones and possibly discounting less in the final days before Christmas. And with no Tickle Me Elmo or Zhu Zhu Pets to draw crushing crowds to the toy aisles, most retailers are being careful not to get stuck with unsold toys.
"As retailers look at consumer confidence numbers, they are skeptical about consumers' willingness to spend this holiday season, and they are trying to avoid getting caught with too much inventory," said Josh Green, chief executive of Panjiva, a supply-chain data company.
LeapFrog LeapPad Explorer, Hot Wheels Wall Tracks, Lalaoopsy Silly Hair dolls and some Lego sets are sold out or hard to find in many parts of the country, but that is mainly because of consistent demand rather than growing waves of frenzied shoppers.
In fact, more than half of parents recently surveyed by UBS and America's Research Group said they felt there was no must-have toy this year, and more than one-third said it was hard to find toys and gifts because nothing was new. Both responses were higher than those in the survey last year, when Squinkies, Paper Jamz and Zoobles were among the most talked-about new toys.
Part of the doldrums this year stems from retailers' conservatism. After loading up on toys in 2010, major stores like Wal-Mart "ended up with a pretty substantial toy overhang that had to be liquidated in the January time frame," said Eric Johnson, director of the center for digital strategies at Dartmouth's Tuck School of Business, who studies the toy industry.
Retailers have cut down on toys overall -- imports of toys in August and September, important months for building holiday inventory, dropped by 9.8 percent compared with last year, according to an analysis of Census Bureau data by Panjiva.
Yet not every product is being cut. Shipments of Legos into the United States in August, September, October and November rose about 155 percent from the same period last year, while those of Hot Wheels rose 43 percent and Barbie merchandise rose 17 percent, according to an analysis of Customs data by Panjiva.
Meanwhile, shipments of the heavily marketed new items such as Angry Birds toys or Lalaoopsy dolls -- none of which has amounted to a breakthrough hit, though they are hard to find -- came in at much lower levels than last year's hot toys.
"Couple that with the increase in shipments of the classics, and it's a sign that regardless of the talk, when retailers are actually placing orders, they're doing so with a very classic mind-set," Mr. Green said. "One sign of caution is betting on products that people know and understand."
The good news for many retailers is that the smaller supplies are leading to early sellouts, and, in some cases, higher prices. Gerrick Johnson, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, said his rough tally shows that in December Wal-Mart has had 12 of the most popular toys in stock less than 40 percent of the time, while Target had them on shelves 50 percent of the time, and Toys "R" Us had them in stock about 60 percent of the time. (Toys "R" Us said last week that it was bringing in new supplies of top sellers, like the LeapPad, in time for Christmas.)
With such low inventory levels, Mr. Johnson said, "as we get closer to the holidays, you'll see less and less price promotion."
Adding to the higher prices, Wal-Mart does not seem to be as aggressive about low prices on toys this year, said Eric Johnson of Dartmouth. "Three or four years ago, Wal-Mart was coming out year after year with these jaw-dropping prices, and just pounding everyone," he said. But this year, Wal-Mart, the nation's biggest retailer, does not appear "to be using toys as a loss leader," he said.
Tara Raddohl, a spokeswoman for Wal-Mart, said by e-mail that it keeps "a close eye on other retailers and adjust our prices proactively for customers so they don't have to do homework to get the best prices." However, she said, unlike last year, inflation on the manufacturing side has led to "some price increases."
Wal-Mart "will do all we can to hold off on price increases as long as possible," she said, "but there are times when, due to market conditions, we have to pass along price increases."
Even without giant price cuts, Wal-Mart's toy sales have eaten into those of Target and other retailers because of another sign of the economic times: layaway.
In October, Wal-Mart brought back layaway, which it discontinued in 2006, saying that its shoppers were on such tight budgets that they needed to pay a bit at a time for gifts like toys and electronics. Company executives said the program has been more popular than expected, particularly in toys. Target acknowledged that its toy business had been affected by the Wal-Mart program.
"Wal-Mart's layaway program has certainly hurt us in November," said Kathryn A. Tesija, Target's executive vice president for merchandising, in a call with analysts last month. "Toys is off to a slow start, and I think that's going to be a bit of an uphill climb for us this year, although we're still optimistic about the rest of the fourth quarter."
Though some products are sold out, and some have higher prices Mr. Johnson of BMO Capital Markets said that over all, retailers had set their expectations so low that they had created a self-fulfilling prophecy.
"Even if consumers do show up and spend, we think there's little opportunity to capture upside, as both retailers and manufacturers have been quite cautious in terms of procurement of toy inventory," he said. He predicted toy sales would be about flat this year compared with last, adding, "that's about as weak as it gets for the toy category."

Top Earners Not So Lofty In the Days Of Recession

Abstract: Analysts say the drop largely reflects the stock market plunge, and most think top incomes recovered somewhat in 2010, as Wall Street rebounded and corporate profits grew. Falling tax rates on the highest earners added to the net income divide, by allowing top earners to keep more of their pay and increasing their incentive to maximize it.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Hold the condolence cards, but the recession cost the rich.
The share of income received by the top 1 percent -- that potent symbol of inequality -- dropped to 17 percent in 2009 from 23 percent in 2007, according to federal tax data. Within the group, average income fell to $957,000 in 2009 from $1.4 million in 2007.
Analysts say the drop largely reflects the stock market plunge, and most think top incomes recovered somewhat in 2010, as Wall Street rebounded and corporate profits grew. Still, the drop alters a figure often emphasized by inequality critics, and it has gone largely unnoticed outside the blogosphere.
By focusing on the top 1 percent, the Occupy Wall Street movement has made economic fairness a subject of street protest and political debate.
"It's very interesting that this has become such a big topic now when the numbers are back to where they were in the 1990s," said Steven Kaplan, an economist at the University of Chicago's business school. "People didn't seem to be complaining about it then."
In 2009 the average income of the top 1 percent, adjusted for inflation, fell below its 1998 level, but remained well above where it was in 1990: $662,000. While the protests follow the worst downturn since the Great Depression, inequality has been growing for three decades, driven by economic and political forces. Globalization created larger markets for those with scarce talents but hurt less educated workers by pitting them against cheap foreign labor. New technology also hurt unskilled workers, by replacing many with machines.
Unions declined, eroding blue-collar bargaining power. The financial industry grew, with paydays heavily weighted toward the top. Corporate culture accepted the growing gap between the executive suite and the factory floor.
Falling tax rates on the highest earners added to the net income divide, by allowing top earners to keep more of their pay and increasing their incentive to maximize it.
In the decades after World War II, by contrast, the average income of the top 1 percent grew only marginally faster than inflation and significantly slower than middle-class incomes. That combination caused inequality to decline throughout much of the 1950, '60s and early '70s.
As recently as 1980, only about one-tenth of the nation's pretax income went to the top 1 percent. By 2000, that share had grown to about 22 percent. It slumped to about 18 percent in 2003, after a market crash, only to rebound by 2007 to levels not achieved since the Roaring '20s.
Pointing to the recent declines at the top, Mr. Kaplan argues the Occupy protesters have accused the wrong villain by focusing on inequality, which he called an inevitable byproduct of growth. "If you want to reduce inequality, all you need to do is put the economy in a recession," he said. "If you want the economy to do well, as all of us do, then you'll get more inequality."
But Harry J. Holzer, an economist at Georgetown University, argues much of the recent growth at the top reflects insider privilege instead of real productivity. "The notion that the really high earners are earning it has become very questionable," he said. "Look at outrageousness of the damage they imposed on the rest of the economy and the cost being born by middle-income Americans."
"There's been rising income inequality all over the world, but nowhere as much as in the United States," he said.
Critics of the Occupy Wall Street movement say the falling incomes at the top show that concerns about inequality are outdated.
"We don't want to spend years focused on income inequality, only to learn that the financial crisis fixed it for us," wrote Megan McArdle in a blog post for The Atlantic.
"Get a time machine, Occupy Wall Street," wrote James Pethokoukis, a blogger at the American Enterprise Institute.
But Jared Bernstein, a former Obama administration official, said that after previous market-related dips, income inequality only soared to new highs. "If you believed the inequality problem had been solved in the early 2000s, you would have been proven terribly wrong," said Mr. Bernstein, now of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
While top incomes probably rose in 2010, most analysts doubt they returned to their 2007 peak, since stocks remain about 20 percent lower. Mr. Kaplan argues that new restraints on Wall Street will keep the income shares of the rich below those earlier levels, a view Mr. Bernstein disputes.
"The structural forces driving inequality remain very much in place," he said.
The income shares of the top 1 percent became a common metric of inequality after a 2003 study by the economists Thomas Piketty and Emmanel Saez, which traced trends back to 1913. It peaked at 24 percent in 1928, just above its 2007 level. Mr. Saez, of the University of California, Berkeley, sides with those who think the rich will soon get richer.
"Barring an economic cataclysm ahead, top earners will be recovering faster than the other 99 percent," he wrote in an e-mail. "The inequality problem is not going away and won't until drastic policy changes are made (as happened during the New Deal)."

Abstract: Congress is debating the extension of a payroll tax cut and unemployment benefits, which some forecasters estimate could lift economic growth next year by more than one percentage point. The minutes of the committee's most recent meeting, in November, said that "participants generally expressed interest in providing additional information to the public about the likely future path of the target federal funds rate."

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve's decision three years ago to reduce short-term interest rates to nearly zero made a splash, both because the Fed had never pushed rates so low and because it said that it planned to keep rates near zero "for some time."
Predicting its own future actions was a new step, an experiment in a time of crisis that the Fed has since repeated several times, most recently in August, when it said that it planned to keep interest rates near zero until at least the summer of 2013.
Now the technique looks increasingly likely to become a permanent method for influencing economic growth. When the Fed's policy-making committee convenes on Tuesday, it will consider the idea of publishing a regular forecast of its future decisions on interest rates. Any such plan would most likely be announced no sooner than its next meeting, in January, when it is already scheduled to publish economic projections.
Forecasting policy is part of a broader set of changes that the Fed is considering to improve public understanding of its methods and goals. The Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, and other officials say that improved communications could deliver a modest boost to the economy with relatively little risk. None of their other options for additional action are nearly so appealing.
"We are actively considering methods that we could use to provide greater clarity," Janet L. Yellen, the Fed's vice chairwoman, said after a recent speech in San Francisco. "Is it a game-changer? I feel that it could have some favorable impact. I don't want to exaggerate how large that is."
The meeting of the Fed's policy-making committee on Tuesday comes at a moment of unusual uncertainty about the plans of other economic policy makers.
Congress is debating the extension of a payroll tax cut and unemployment benefits, which some forecasters estimate could lift economic growth next year by more than one percentage point. Europe is convulsing, and Mr. Bernanke is among the economists who have warned that the United States could slip back into recession if the euro collapsed.
Recent federal data suggest that the United States economy is improving somewhat, reducing the pressure on the Fed to expand its aid programs. Even though unemployment remains at a level that Fed officials regard as unacceptable, most analysts who follow the central bank say they do not expect major changes in policy at this meeting.
Another round of asset purchases remains a possibility -- including a specific investment in mortgage-backed securities -- but officials are concerned that the benefits diminish with each new round, while the risks, both economic and political, have increased.
Monetary economists had long agreed that central banks should avoid making predictions or commitments. They worried that deviations from the predicted path would create costly turbulence in financial markets as investors corrected their misconceptions.
In recent years, however, more policy makers have concluded that the power to shape expectations should be embraced. Some central banks have come to regard speaking about the future as a primary policy tool. For example, the central banks of Britain, Canada and Australia, among others, have adopted explicit goals for inflation and the rate of increase in prices and wages. The central banks of Sweden and Norway publish forecasts of the level of interest rates. New Zealand announces goals and forecasts.
Mr. Bernanke is a longtime advocate of setting an inflation objective. But Congress has given the Fed a dual mandate to manage inflation and unemployment, and past proposals to formalize an inflation goal have foundered on the question of how to communicate an equal concern about the health of the labor market. This remains the subject of lively debate within the Fed.
Predicting the future is less controversial. The minutes of the committee's most recent meeting, in November, said that "participants generally expressed interest in providing additional information to the public about the likely future path of the target federal funds rate."
Such a forecast likely would cover the expected path of policy over the next three years, including information about the range of predictions. The Fed already publishes similar predictions about economic growth, inflation and unemployment four times a year.
Introducing a forecast in the near future could reduce borrowing costs for businesses and consumers if it shows that the committee expects rates to remain near zero beyond mid-2013. Investors demand compensation for long-term investments based in large part on their expectations about the future level of short-term rates.
Even some members of the committee who oppose additional stimulus, however, want to start publishing the forecast. Charles I. Plosser, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, who has voted repeatedly against expansion of the Fed's aid programs, said he favored the proposal irrespective of whether the immediate effect was to stimulate the economy.
"I think what we want to do is to communicate to the public as clearly as we can," Mr. Plosser said in a recent interview. "I'm not doing this to manipulate policy. I'm doing this to be as transparent about policy as possible."
Some analysts, however, warn that increased clarity could have negative consequences.
"My concern is that the Fed might place itself in a self-induced bind" if it predicts a policy path that later seems unwise, said Dana Saporta, a United States economist at Credit Suisse. "They would feel some pressure to stick to the implicit promise in the forward guidance, lest they incur the wrath of the markets and Congress."
Ms. Saporta also noted that the 2007 decision to publish economic projections had focused some unflattering attention on the Fed's inability to predict the future.
"We have this public loss of innocence, in a sense," she said. "The more clear the Fed becomes, the more we realize that the central bank does not have all the answers."
The Fed decided against publishing policy forecasts in 2007, citing concerns about the public misunderstanding the predictions as commitments.
"Over time, market participants might learn how little weight they should give any published average of 'appropriate' policies," Donald L. Kohn, then the Fed's vice chairman, said in a speech explaining the decision. "But the learning process could take time and be costly, and we would not be assured of a successful outcome."
Mr. Kohn, now a fellow at the Brookings Institution, a policy research group in Washington, said that remained a concern. But he also noted a new reason to reconsider. Having reduced rates to almost zero, the Fed has limited its ability to control expectations by adjusting rates. And he said that he believed transparency tended to enhance the central bank's credibility.
"Ultimately the credibility of the forecast doesn't derive from whether it's a point wrong one year or another," he said. "It derives from whether, over the long run, they basically see the emerging trends correctly" -- and on the quality of the methodology.

Full text: MOSCOW -- Here is the rub for Vladimir V. Putin: The people who stood outside the Kremlin on Saturday, chanting epithets directed at him, are the ones who have prospered greatly during his 12 years in power.
They were well traveled and well mannered; they wore hipster glasses. They were wonky (some held aloft graphs showing statistical deviations that they said proved election fraud). In short, they were young urban professionals, a group that benefited handsomely from Moscow's skyrocketing real estate market and the trickle-down effect of the nation's oil wealth.
Maria A. Mikhaylova came to the demonstration in designer eyeglasses and with her hair tied back with a white ribbon, the symbol of the new opposition movement. Ms. Mikhaylova, 35, works in a Moscow bank, and said her goal was not to upend Mr. Putin's government. "We don't want any violence," she said, but rather to compel the political system to take account of the concerns of people like her.
"I work a lot, and I'm doing all right," she said. "And I could be doing a lot of other things with my weekend than standing here."
It is a paradox, but one that has been documented by social scientists: the residents of Moscow and other large cities tend to express greater frustration with Prime Minister Putin as his government has helped make them wealthier. One explanation is the high level of public corruption here, which threatens new personal wealth. A second is a phenomenon seen in Gen. Augusto Pinochet's Chile, that economic growth can inadvertently undermine autocratic rule by creating an urban professional class that clamors for new political rights.
"This is not a protest of empty pots," said Viktor A. Shenderovich, a political commentator, on the radio station Ekho Moskvy. "This is political, not economic. The coal miners came out because they were not paid. The people coming onto the streets of Moscow are very well off. These are people protesting because they were humiliated. They were not asked. They were just told, 'Putin is coming back.' "
Nor was it a protest by the intelligentsia, the class that rose up against the Soviet government two decades ago.
On Sunday, President Dmitry A. Medvedev turned to Facebook, the same medium that helped generate the rally of tens of thousands of people, and issued a statement saying that he disagreed with the protesters' slogans, but that he had ordered an investigation into reports of fraud in the parliamentary elections last week.
"People have the right to express their position, which is what they did yesterday," Mr. Medvedev wrote Sunday, adding: "I agree neither with the slogans, nor the statements voiced at the protests. Nevertheless, I have ordered checks into all the reports from polling stations regarding the compliance with the election laws."
The protesters themselves seemed uncertain about where their effort was heading. But they were giddy nonetheless.
"It is impossible to impede us," wrote Roman Volobuyev in the online magazine Afisha. "It will be difficult. Some of us will need to change our professions. Some of us will have to do the opposite -- finally actually do our job. To build a party without first notarizing it with" the Kremlin's most influential political strategist, Vladislav Y. Surkov.
"To report the news," Mr. Volobuyev wrote. "To file lawsuits -- thousands of them every day. Coming out with placards and standing in a crowd -- I know, it's a stupid pastime, but we have to do it."
It must be frustrating for Mr. Putin that those now protesting have enjoyed growing wealth while he has been the country's predominant figure, first as president and now as prime minister. From 2000, the year he assumed the presidency, until 2008, wages, adjusted for inflation, grew at an average of nearly 15 percent a year. But while salaries are still rising, they are increasing much more slowly today -- at an average of 1.3 percent per year since the onset of the global economic crisis in 2008, according to data compiled by Citibank.
And as they become wealthier, residents of cities are prone to venting their frustration with the political system.
In a 2010 study of Muscovites' political leanings, Mikhail E. Dmitriyev, president of the Center for Strategic Development, a research organization in Moscow, zeroed in on real estate. Property values in Moscow tripled from 2002 until 2010 -- significantly raising residents' net worth but not their satisfaction with the government, because it also raised the stakes in real estate lawsuits that are typically handled in notoriously corrupt courts.
"In Moscow, rising incomes correlate with respondents' saying discontent is rising," Mr. Dmitriyev wrote. Moscow and other cities, he wrote, are incubating a hostile population, especially of young men.
"These are five million individuals dangerously concentrated within a 10-mile proximity around the Kremlin," he wrote.
When it comes to middle-class uprisings, Daniel Treisman, a professor of political science at the University of California, Los Angeles, has documented a broad trend. Authoritarian leaders who pursue effective economic policies become victims of their own success, with General Pinochet in Chile being a prime example. In Russia, after a decade-long oil boom, about a third of the population is now considered middle class.
And political rights were indeed the main demand at Saturday's rally, which was attended by students and their parents, retired people and young professionals. "Before this demo it was announced that our color is white, the color of peace," said Alexei Kolotilov, 47, a security guard, taking a break from blowing a red whistle as he marched to the rally site.
His daughter, he said, was attending the event separately with fellow students. "We don't want a revolution," Mr. Kolotilov said. "We want fair elections."
If there was a single catalyst to the recent events, it was probably Mr. Putin's unilateral announcement in September that he would run again for the presidency, in effect swapping places with Mr. Medvedev. Some Russians now snidely refer to this as "rokirovka" -- the Russian word for castling in chess, the move in which a rook and the king are moved at the same time, to shelter the king.
The leaders of this new opposition represent a diverse array of groups, including minority political parties, which typically oppose one another as much as they oppose United Russia, the governing party of Mr. Putin and Mr. Medvedev.
Protest organizers met on Sunday, trying to pull together some sort of leadership council. They hope to build momentum for bigger events and to increase the pressure on the government, potentially leading to a recount that could strip United Russia of additional seats in Parliament.
Their movement does not have the economic despair that helped fuel previous uprisings in Russia and more recently helped to stir the Arab Spring in North Africa and the Middle East. Bloggers were calling it Russia's Great December Evolution.
Yuri Dryugin, 45, an entrepreneur in the transportation sector, said he deliberately invalidated his ballot in the election last week "because I've had enough of all this." At the rally, Mr. Dryugin wore a New York Yankees cap, bought on a trip to the United States in October.
His demand now, he said, is simple: "Fair elections with all the parties present."
Oksana, 18, a student from Kirov who plans to become a lawyer, said she was not sure what she expected to come of the protests. Oksana, who declined to give her last name, said her mother was an accountant, her father a manager at a computer company and her older sister was planning to start her own business. "Unfortunately, a civilized rally in our country is a rare thing so far," she said.
"But now I see that it's possible."

A Pentagon the Country Can Afford

Abstract: Besides the nearly $500 billion in cuts that are supposed to start in January 2013, the budget act that created the supercommittee mandated an initial cut of roughly $450 billion in defense spending, spread over the next decade. According to the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, that would put basic defense spending for 2013 around $472 billion -- about the same, in inflation-adjusted terms, as what was spent in 2007.

Full text: If you listen to defense industry lobbyists, hawks in Congress and the Pentagon, the sky is falling and with it, American security. It isn't.
The failure of the "supercommittee" to reach a deficit agreement is supposed to trigger $1.2 trillion in automatic cuts in federal spending over the next decade, nearly $500 billion of that from the basic Pentagon budget. Many Republicans, and some Democrats, are already talking about getting the Pentagon off the hook. Representative Howard McKeon, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, has promised legislation to prevent the cuts from taking effect. We are no fans of the supercommittee process, but if the Pentagon's spending is wrestled back into rationality, it will be progress. Walking away would be a blow to Washington's financial credibility. There is room to cut, if it is done with prudence and innovation.
The Pentagon has had a blank check for most of the last 10 years. Last year's basic budget of $530 billion (not counting the costs of fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan) was about $140 billion higher, in inflation-adjusted terms, than in 2001. This year's base budget is expected to be about $526 billion, which is still excessive.
Besides the nearly $500 billion in cuts that are supposed to start in January 2013, the budget act that created the supercommittee mandated an initial cut of roughly $450 billion in defense spending, spread over the next decade. According to the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, that would put basic defense spending for 2013 around $472 billion -- about the same, in inflation-adjusted terms, as what was spent in 2007.
There is also a misperception that the Pentagon cannot handle cuts right now because a decade of war supposedly decimated the arsenal. A new study by the Henry L. Stimson Center calculated that the Pentagon spent $1 trillion on procurement during that time -- a 97 percent increase from 2000 to 2010 -- and was able to "modernize and improve our equipment inventory across the board."
Of course, the cuts must be made wisely. There is a serious problem with the law's requirement that all programs -- vital or not -- be cut by the same percentage to reach the "sequester" number. The budget control act does allow an exemption for pay and benefits for military personnel, but if that option is exercised, other accounts have to be cut by even more.
If the cuts do go forward, Congress and the administration need to find a way to give the Pentagon some flexibility to choose between high-value programs and those that can be ended, scaled back or delayed. Lawmakers should consider phasing in the cuts somewhat more gradually, so the choices can be smarter and disruption minimized.
The Pentagon will have to be pushed. Indeed, officials say they are making no contingency plans for the 2013 cuts. Instead of waiting for rescue, they should be figuring out what reductions make sense and how to carry them out.
Making cuts of this size will not be easy. Logical places to look include reducing the cost of personnel and benefits. Because the wars are winding down, the Army can come down in troops, to 520,000 from roughly 569,000; to a lesser extent, so can the Navy and the Air Force. The premium for Tricare, the military health insurance program, could be raised by $50 a month for employed, working-age military retirees, and other reforms could be applied to pay and benefits. Altogether this could save $20 billion annually.
Cutting the Pentagon civilian work force by 10 percent, or 74,000 people, and retiring old fighter planes and bombers could save $13 billion a year from operations. Closing some bases in the United States and overseas, and curbing construction, including suspending plans to locate families with troops deployed in South Korea, could save at least $5 billion more over the next decade. Tens of billions are spent annually on cold-war systems ill-suited to 21st-century needs -- aircraft carriers, nuclear attack submarines, stealth destroyers and manned aerial combat fighters. Some $15 billion could be saved annually by pruning the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter order to 1,000 and ending the V-22 Osprey program and the Joint Tactical Radio System. Another sound target: bloated nuclear-related programs, which could cost upward of $600 billion over the next decade across the government.
To do any of this effectively, the Pentagon will also need a major change in culture and procedure. President Obama and former Defense Secretary Robert Gates began enforcing more spending discipline two years ago, but much more is needed. Weak oversight of contractors, and the Pentagon's passion for excessive bells and whistles, have raised costs on almost every major weapons system. Military commitments must be scaled back. One expert says the Navy can shrink its fleet and save $15 billion annually if it keeps ships abroad longer while rotating crews in and out.
Even after the sequester cuts, the United States would still be investing about as much in defense as China, Russia, Britain, France, Japan and Germany combined, and could still protect vital national security interests.
Defense lobbyists are in overdrive, warning about an enormous loss of jobs if the cuts take effect. We agree this is the worst time to increase unemployment, of any kind. That is why Congress should be working to stimulate the economy now, so the country can get its fiscal house in order once the economy recovers. When it is time to cut, there is nothing sacrosanct about defense industry jobs.
Congress needs to compromise soon on a rational deficit plan with both tax increases and spending cuts. Whatever happens, the Pentagon needs to learn to live within the country's means.

Abstract: [...] otherwise I've stayed around Notting Hill, and one tends to notice things: the variety of small retail businesses that cater to the neighborhood (and people who come to the Portobello Market), the many organic and fair-trade food purveyors, the amount of Christmas stuff (greens, cards, toys) that is generally nicer and less expensive than what you find in New York.

Full text: FOR the last few days I've been in London on assignment, staying at the Portobello Hotel, where -- my friend Tim Blanks tells me -- he used to visit Nico in the '70s. "It may have been the first boutique hotel in London," he said, recalling that the front-desk man in the Nico era wore a cropped Vivienne Westwood top with feather trim.
To me, the Portobello, in Notting Hill, is actually the un-boutique hotel. It doesn't charge for Wi-Fi, and you can get porridge any time you want it. Somebody in the management thought to add a small carton of milk to the familiar bottles in the mini bar (with a cereal bowl in the cupboard). In other words, the hotel gives you exactly what you need, and doesn't try to be stylish or hip. It just is.
This is the first time I've stayed for a length of time in Notting Hill. I made one dash early in the week to the West End to meet Hussein Chalayan for lunch at J. Sheekey, which was packed, as many restaurants in this end of town are.
This morning I'm going to the National Gallery to see the Leonardo da Vinci show. But otherwise I've stayed around Notting Hill, and one tends to notice things: the variety of small retail businesses that cater to the neighborhood (and people who come to the Portobello Market), the many organic and fair-trade food purveyors, the amount of Christmas stuff (greens, cards, toys) that is generally nicer and less expensive than what you find in New York.
At the end of the day, when I'm walking back to the hotel, taking a different route to discover something new, I'm actually finding things I want to buy. And I can't remember when I last had that desire in Paris or on one of London's big commercial streets.
Anyway, I'm not sure what to think. The London newspapers are filled with reports about the eurozone crisis, British unemployment and inflation, and firsthand accounts of the recent riots. One article expressed the concern that England was following the United States and becoming a nation of haves and have-nots.
In The Guardian, a 20-year-old law student described feeling happy when he joined the looting during the riots and set fire to a sports car in a showroom. He said he felt untouchable. I don't know what kind of lawyer the man will make, but you can understand why the riots remain on people's minds.
"Fashion has always pursued the rich," Mr. Chalayan said over lunch. (More from our conversation later.) Fashion has also pursued ideas and innovation, with a dose of reality. I have to admit Karl Lagerfeld's Indian banquet show for Chanel last week left me cold, as did his comment to Lisa Armstrong in The Daily Telegraph: "People have always responded to difficulty by dressing up in jewels."
Really? I prefer the Duchess of Cambridge's more contemporary response. For a benefit concert the other night, she wore a $100 dress from Zara. She just got on with it.
By the way, check out Kurt Anderson's excellent piece in Vanity Fair about why there has been a lack of innovation for the last 20 years in the arts and style.

Full text: BERLIN -- Even as European leaders put together their latest response to the euro crisis last week, a German-American clash over how best to manage a vast financial crisis and put the world economy back on a sound footing was set in stark relief.
Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany defied skeptics and laid the groundwork for a deeper union that she said rights the mistakes of the euro's birth and puts integration on a stable path for the long term. In the process, she forced German fiscal discipline on Europe as the prescription for the ills that afflict the region.
Yet even as the cogs of the European agreement were being fitted into place, President Obama issued his sharpest warning yet about the German-led solution. He said the focus on long-term political and economic change was well and good, but emphasized that failure to react quickly and strongly enough to market forces threatened the euro's survival in the coming months.
At the heart of the debate is the question of how far governments must bend to the power of markets. Mr. Obama sees retaining the stability of markets and the confidence of investors as a primary goal of government and a prerequisite for achieving any major changes in public policy. Mrs. Merkel views the financial industry with profound skepticism and argues, in almost moralistic fashion, that real change is impossible unless lenders and borrowers pay a high price for their mistakes.
"It's a battle of ideas," said Almut Moller, a European Union expert at the German Council on Foreign Relations. "There is a different understanding of how to set up a sustainable economy in a globalizing world. Here there is a major rift."
It will be difficult to know for weeks, or maybe even months, which approach is right. But it is clear that the stakes are high, with the health of the world economy, the European Union and perhaps Mr. Obama's presidential hopes hanging in the balance. Economists have fretted for months that forcing austerity plans on Europe's troubled economies -- while a good long-term solution -- could lead to deep recessions in the short term, compromising any chance for effective change.
On a political level, Mrs. Merkel could look back on last week's meeting of leaders in Brussels and declare, "We have succeeded." Where her mentor, former Chancellor Helmut Kohl, failed, Mrs. Merkel managed to push through more easily enforceable oversight of government spending that would allow the European Commission the right to review national budgets and object to those that violate agreed-upon debt limits.
Initial market reaction to the Brussels meeting was positive, but that has happened before as deal after deal has been struck between European leaders. Skeptics say that, economically, Mrs. Merkel, the hard-line austerity queen of Europe, has won a hollow victory, one that will fall apart like every other solution that was proclaimed as lasting but proved to be fleeting.
"If the new arrangement turns out to be too toothless to enforce the rules, we'll be back to square one," said Thomas Klau, a political analyst and head of the Paris office of the European Council on Foreign Relations.
Just ahead of Mrs. Merkel's unexpectedly robust success, Mr. Obama issued his unheeded warning from across the Atlantic. "There's a short-term crisis that has to be resolved," he said, "to make sure that markets have confidence that Europe stands behind the euro."
Mr. Obama is fiercely proud of the record he achieved in keeping not just the United States but also the entire world out of an acute financial meltdown after 2008, presiding over enormous stimulus spending in tandem with unrestrained support from the Federal Reserve. The president and his allies now say that in doing so, they may well have prevented the world from falling into another Great Depression.
By ignoring the short-term threat, American officials say, Mrs. Merkel is unwittingly courting the very threat they so narrowly managed to keep at bay. Strong governments can borrow cheaply, mainstream economists on both sides of the Atlantic argue, and have an obligation to intervene more aggressively than they would normally to make up for the slump in private demand.
Germans are staunchly opposed to any solution that involves greater debt, but even more so to policies that might court inflation, their historic obsession. Policy makers in Berlin and at the Bundesbank headquarters in Frankfurt have urged restraint on the part of the European Central Bank, insisting it should not buy up too many bonds from heavily indebted euro zone countries.
"We will save the euro. We have to save the euro. We have the biggest resources and the biggest interest. But we will hearken fiscal probity," said Josef Joffe, publisher of the German weekly Die Zeit, describing the German position. "We will not sacrifice our memories."
The Obama team argues that with recession on the horizon for Europe, the threat of inflation is low and the real threat is a great depression. Administration officials, and many economists, argue that Germany is remembering the wrong crisis -- it should be focused on a repeat of the deflation and contraction of the 1930s, not a repeat of the hyperinflation of the '20s.
Americans take a far more accommodating approach to the problem of moral hazard than Germans do. The time for a reckoning is after financial stability has been restored, Americans say; otherwise, it is ordinary people, not the rich, who suffer most in a downturn.
President Obama, of course, faces re-election and sees the crisis in Europe as one of the biggest threats to his chances, as it could tip the American economy back into recession if austerity worsens the slump there. German officials are well aware of that and complain privately that electoral results are Mr. Obama's chief concern.
The Germans, for their part, seem almost to welcome the collapse of market confidence: without the rising pressure from markets, Silvio Berlusconi would not have resigned as prime minister of Italy. And without the incentive of fear, most European partners would have been more reluctant to give Brussels oversight authority over national budgets -- and the right to impose sanctions for violators.
"The Germans had a strategic insight or advantage to let the crisis get to the threshold within the European Union necessary for France to be willing to hand over the kind of sovereignty the country has always resisted," said Jacob Funk Kirkegaard of the Peter G. Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. "You could say that the crisis has either been the wake-up call or the tool that Germany has used to beat them into submission."
Many Germans also view the Anglo-American infatuation with the financial industry as the root of the West's decline in competitiveness with the rising East. Big banks create and exploit bubbles, requiring huge bailouts, they say, without creating sustainable growth. Meanwhile, German exports will set a record this year, breaching the 1 trillion euro mark, or roughly $1.3 trillion, for the first time.
But Mrs. Merkel's strategy remains highly risky. A year ago she had miscalculated when she insisted that any bailout had to include the private sector's chipping in with the public sector, a requirement included in the Greek rescue. The markets punished Italy and Spain for that stance, and it was dropped last week at the Brussels gathering.
Mr. Obama was worried enough to send his Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, to ring the alarm bells all over the Continent ahead of the summit. But the other members of the euro zone swallowed their reservations and moved ahead with Friday's agreement because their rising financing costs left them little choice but to follow Germany's lead.
"The countries that had resisted these kinds of moves in the past are under so much pressure currently that they see it's necessary to regain credibility," said Jurgen Matthes, senior economist at the Cologne Institute for Economic Research.
In the end, Mrs. Merkel's view clearly won out over Mr. Obama's. "Merkel is calling the tune and writing the notes," said Mr. Joffe, the publisher of Die Zeit.
Whether Mrs. Merkel's strategy works is a question that markets will begin to ask on Monday, whether she likes it or not.

Full text: Students across New York State will sit longer for high-stakes standardized tests in language arts and math this April compared with past years, education officials indicated Friday, drawing criticism from school leaders and parents who believe that lengthier tests are a move in the wrong direction.
A week after David Abrams, the state's longtime testing director, was forced to resign after he sent an unauthorized memorandum about lengthening testing to school districts, officials declined to specify how much time they planned to add. Mr. Abrams's memo said the tests would grow to more than four hours -- over several days -- for reading, from about two-and-a-half hours now, and to three hours or more for math, from an average of two hours now.
Top officials disavowed the memo and said the increases would not be so drastic. They said Friday that they would send the new times and other details to districts next week.
The annual tests, given to students in grades 3 through 8, will factor into teacher evaluations for the first time this year. Extending test times, state officials said, would enable them to field-test new questions that would not count toward a student's score but could be used to develop future tests.
Currently, new questions are tested in practice exams given in selected districts. That has raised the concern that students, knowing the tests do not count, do not try very hard, resulting in misleading data. Such inaccurate feedback, these officials say, has contributed to the state's score inflation in recent years.
The Board of Regents discussed including sample multiple-choice questions in the actual tests at a meeting in December 2010, and the State Education Department issued a memo in March notifying districts that the change would take effect next spring.
But some school administrators and parents say it was not clear from the memo that a result would be longer tests.
Critics assert that more time spent on testing cuts into time for classroom instruction. They also say that lengthier tests penalize younger children who cannot concentrate for long periods, giving an inaccurate assessment of their abilities.
"I think the last thing we want is a test of stamina," said Richard Organisciak, superintendent of the 11,000-student New Rochelle district in Westchester County. "The thought of a third grader sitting there for three hours -- it boggles my mind that he would stay as focused or perform as well on a high-stakes test."
The stakes are particularly high in New York City, where a top score can help a student gain admission to some of the city's most coveted middle schools.
Richard C. Iannuzzi, president of New York State United Teachers, the union representing 218,000 public school teachers, said the state should be trying to decrease testing time, not increase it.
"If it becomes a burden on the student and teacher and it takes away from instructional time, then we've missed the point altogether," he said. "We've moved away from an instrument that measures and improves student growth, and gotten wound up in the concept of how much data we can collect."
Nationwide, most states already blend field questions into actual exams taken by students because doing so provides more reliable data about questions, said Brian Gong, executive director of the National Center for the Improvement of Educational Assessment, a nonprofit group that provides support to state education departments. "That's a very common practice; the SAT also does it," he said. "It's the best way to get real data."
New York's tests are shorter than those given in some other states: third graders take a 150-minute test in language arts, and a 100-minute test in math, compared with 150-minute to 270-minute tests in other states, with sample questions typically accounting for 10 to 20 minutes, Mr. Gong said. "There are many people asking tests to do more things," he added, "which technically requires the test to be longer."
Kathleen M. Cashin, a Fordham University education professor who joined New York's Regents in March, said there should have been more discussion in the state about increasing test times.
"I think we have too much testing now," she said. "I mean, is the purpose of education just to identify weaknesses through accountability measures? Or is the purpose to expand the child's learning with knowledge and vocabulary, and give them the opportunity to discuss and think at a higher level?"
Lisa Siegman, principal of Public School 3 in Greenwich Village, said she would like to see evidence that increasing the length of state tests would help schools like hers to better educate their students. "They're trying to measure something," she said, "but I'm not quite sure it connects to what we do."

Getting a Grip on Taxes Before the Storm Hits

Abstract: The A.M.T. was originally meant to keep wealthy people from paying too little in taxes. Because it was not indexed for inflation, however, Congress has had to approve periodic fixes to keep it from affecting many more people than intended.

Full text: THIS has been a year of financial uncertainty, both here and abroad. But one thing is sure for next year: taxes will definitely be on politicians' agendas and voters' minds.
This year, tax advisers agree, was benign in terms of changes to the Internal Revenue Code. But that comes after two tumultuous years. In 2009, tax preparers waited nervously for action on the expiring estate tax that never came. Then, in late 2010 came a jumble of unexpected tax actions: from reinstating the estate tax for this year and next, with a higher exemption level than most tax advisers expected, to extending the Bush-era tax cuts for two more years.
So how to handle these last few weeks of the tax year? As is true every year, taxpayers should run a checklist for everything from selling securities that have lost money to taking advantage of annual gift allowances.
But even then, seemingly straightforward deductions are not always so. The $500 energy tax credit, for example, limits the amount you can deduct for new windows to 10 percent of the value up to $200. In other words, you had to spend $2,000 on windows to get the full window credit.
And charitable deductions can be more broadly defined to include costs incurred while volunteering, said Mark Steber, chief tax officer at Jackson Hewitt, a tax preparation company. "You can't deduct the value of your time, but you can deduct your out-of-pocket expenses," he said.
But beyond the usual recommendations, the tax advisers I spoke to stressed that you should use this year to get your affairs in order for what promises to be an uncertain two years of tax policy.
"For high-net-worth individuals, chances are the next year or so is going to be a challenging time," said Chris Johnson, head of United States wealth advisory at Barclays Wealth. "There is going to be a lot of attention focused on ways to extract additional tax dollars."
If Congress does not act to extend a series of smaller tax deductions, next year could be costly for middle-income taxpayers as well. Here are some of the more pressing issues to consider.
WHAT MAY EXPIRE AFTER 2011 Every year Congress passes a series of so-called patches, renewing some 70 tax breaks for another year or two. In the past, this has been a formality, much as raising the debt ceiling used to be. This year, it remains to be seen what Congress will do.
Mark Luscombe, principal federal tax analyst at CCH, a publisher of research and software for tax lawyers and accountants, noted that when these patches expired in 2009 and were re-enacted retroactively at the end of 2010, the delay wreaked havoc with tax planning.
The deductions vary. Teachers, for example, can deduct $250 toward classroom expenses.
Other patches affect broader swaths of the population. One allows residents to choose between deducting state income and sales tax against their federal tax. This is a favorite of people in states like Florida and Texas that have no state income tax.
In high-tax states, the big worry is what happens to the alternative minimum tax, a parallel system of taxation that cancels out many deductions. The A.M.T. was originally meant to keep wealthy people from paying too little in taxes. Because it was not indexed for inflation, however, Congress has had to approve periodic fixes to keep it from affecting many more people than intended.
Without a fix next year, Stephen A. Baxley, director of tax and financial planning at Bessemer Trust, said, the A.M.T. would "hit an additional 20 million people, and most of them are middle-income taxpayers." It normally claims around four million taxpayers.
Two of the big triggers for the A.M.T. are high state taxes on property and income, which hit residents of New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and California disproportionately, said Alfred Peguero, partner in PricewaterhouseCoopers's private company services practice.
For older people, there is again a chance that the provision allowing them to directly donate the required minimum withdrawal from their retirement account to charity may be delayed or not renewed. Currently, people over 70 1/2 can donate up to $100,000 to charity. If this patch were to disappear, the federal income tax on the withdrawal and the charitable deduction would cancel each other out. But some states do not allow charitable deductions above a certain income, or at all.
"Higher taxpayers have their itemized deductions reduced in New York," Mr. Baxley said. "In Connecticut and New Jersey, you don't get any benefit from itemized deductions."
WHAT CHANGES IN 2012 There are several provisions that will take effect or lapse regardless of Congressional action.
One set to start in 2012 is a requirement that brokers report the purchase price on mutual funds and exchange-traded funds to the Internal Revenue Service for capital gains purposes. (They began doing this for stocks this year.)
The default method of reporting is called "first in, first out," which could result in higher capital gains taxes if those first shares were much cheaper than more recent ones. Taxpayers have the option of electing other reporting methods, like "last in, first out," which benefits people who bought shares over many years, presuming those shares have appreciated.
There are also two significant tax breaks set to end. One is a loophole that allows people whose marginal tax bracket is under 15 percent to pay no capital gains tax when selling securities held for more than a year.
"It's been around for three years now but people aren't aware of it, generally because when their income is that low they don't have the ability to buy things that appreciate," said Glenn Frank, director of investment tax strategy at Lexington Wealth Management.
But he said that parents could give $26,000 of appreciated stock as a gift to, for example, a child who has moved home after college and has a low-paying job. (The 15 percent bracket ends at $34,500 for a single person but stretches to $69,000 for a married couple filing jointly.) No taxes would be owed as long as the gains in the securities did not push the recipient's income out of the 15 percent bracket.
The other break is a provision in the 2010 Tax Relief Act that allowed 100 percent of an investment made in a private company to be free of capital gains taxes. This provision is a boon to venture capitalists who can reap millions in gains tax-free. Mr. Luscombe said he suspected the exemption would revert to 50 percent of the gain.
WHAT HAPPENS IN 2013 In many ways, 2011 may be the calm before the storm. If Congress and President Obama continue to disagree, then the Bush tax cuts automatically expire in 2013, raising taxes on income, capital gains and dividends and lowering the exemptions for estate and gift taxes. Add to this the prospect of an additional 3.8 percent Medicare surcharge on investment income. Then again, the two sides could do something completely unexpected.
The uncertainty means that tax planners are going to have a harder time giving their usual advice -- gauging whether it is better to accelerate income and delay deductions or vice versa. Generally, advisers like to have some certainty for two or three years before making a recommendation.
Mr. Peguero said that he would advise business owners "to sell appreciated assets in 2012 and wait until 2013 to make a capital investment where the deduction may mean more."
He added, "That's presuming taxes stay the same."
The uncertainty also means that advisers are spending time urging their clients to remain calm. "I think people can do themselves a great disservice by trying to time the markets and the legislation," Mr. Johnson said. "You're opening yourself up to a lot of risk."
This is where the savviest tax minds cannot compete with politicians bent on getting re-elected.

Abstract: Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and legislative leaders announced on Tuesday that they had reached an agreement to overhaul New York State's income tax, creating a higher tax bracket for the highest-income residents and reducing the tax rate for millions of middle-class residents. The State Senate majority leader, Dean G. Skelos, a Long Island Republican, offered his support in a written statement, saying, "This comprehensive plan will reduce the tax rate for middle-class families to their lowest levels in more than 50 years, create thousands of new private sector jobs and begin to turn our economy around."

Full text: ALBANY -- Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and legislative leaders announced on Tuesday that they had reached an agreement to overhaul New York State's income tax, creating a higher tax bracket for the highest-income residents and reducing the tax rate for millions of middle-class residents.
The deal came together just 25 days before the expiration of the state's so-called millionaires' tax -- actually a surcharge on all individuals earning over $200,000 a year. The proposed tax overhaul would result in most residents' being taxed next year at a lower rate than this year.
The long-term impact on the wealthy was described by some as a cut and others as an increase: beginning next year, the highest-income earners will be taxed at a lower rate than at present, but at a higher rate than had been expected with the expiration of the surcharge.
The changes, which the Legislature could vote on as early as Wednesday, would net $1.9 billion in annual revenue; the expiring surcharge had been generating about $4 billion a year.
It was a piece of political craftsmanship that allowed both Democrats and Republicans to declare victory.
Mr. Cuomo, who as governor has repeatedly opposed tax increases as well as proposals to renew the surcharge, released a video message on Tuesday saying that the new top bracket would help address the projected $3.5 billion budget gap that the state is facing next year.
"While I am against higher taxes, and I believe our long-term economic future for this state is enhanced by in fact lowering taxes to make us more competitive, to deal with this emergency, short-term, we do need additional revenue," Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, said. "If I were to close the entire gap by budget cuts, it would decimate essential services, doing real harm to the state's economy and strangling local governments all across this state."
On Tuesday, the governor called for a special session to begin on Wednesday at which legislators would debate and vote on the tax package.
The Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, told reporters, "I think this is a big victory for New Yorkers. People who make $50,000 a year will no longer be paying the same marginal tax rate as people who make $500,000 a year."
The State Senate majority leader, Dean G. Skelos, a Long Island Republican, offered his support in a written statement, saying, "This comprehensive plan will reduce the tax rate for middle-class families to their lowest levels in more than 50 years, create thousands of new private sector jobs and begin to turn our economy around."
The agreement drew praise from an unlikely combination of business groups, which applauded the governor for devoting himself to job creation, and labor unions, which said the new revenue would help ensure that Mr. Cuomo would follow through with his promise to increase education and health care spending in the budget next year.
"We participated very heavily in reaching out to legislators to strike a deal that provided adequate revenues," said Richard C. Iannuzzi, the president of New York State United Teachers. "It looks like they've done that."
Some Democrats lauded the Occupy Wall Street movement for changing the political climate in Albany, where lawmakers had planned to allow the millionaires' tax to simply expire.
"It's a credit to the courage of the Occupy protesters on Wall Street, in Albany, in Buffalo and Rochester, and across the country," said Michael Kink, the executive director of the labor-backed Strong Economy for All Coalition. "Albany is taxing the rich to create jobs, to allow better budgets and to provide tax relief for the middle class. Those are the things we were trying to make happen."
But some liberals, inside and outside the Legislature, were dissatisfied. Billy Easton, the executive director of the Alliance for Quality Education, said the money to be raised by the new tax bracket was "not enough." And Kenneth Brynien, the president of the Public Employees Federation, said the deal "falls short in obtaining the goal of a fair tax system."
Some conservatives were also critical, including the Assembly minority leader, Brian M. Kolb, Republican of Canandaigua. "The bottom line is that taxes are being raised in New York State and we are still not dealing with our state's serious spending problem," Assemblyman Kolb said. "Tax hikes have never been the answer for creating more private sector jobs and long-term prosperity for New Yorkers."
The deal was also criticized because it had been developed without debate, hearings or any form of public review. Mr. Cuomo announced his plans to seek an overhaul of the tax code on Sunday, via an essay he offered for publication to newspaper editorial pages, and the negotiations between the governor and legislative leaders took place behind closed doors.
Three government watchdog groups released a statement condemning the process, saying "matters of this magnitude should not be decided in secret, during the legislative hiatus and without a formal process." Susan Lerner, the executive director of one of the groups, Common Cause New York, called the secret negotiations an "abuse of the process" that was "breathtaking in its scope."
The state's current income tax rates are relatively flat, taxing any individuals who earn $20,000 or more, as well as couples who earn $40,000 or more and file joint tax returns, at the same 6.85 percent rate.
But for the last three years, individuals who earned more than $200,000 a year have also been subject to the tax surcharge, paying 7.85 percent on income from $200,000 to $500,000, and 8.97 percent on income over $500,000. For couples filing jointly, the surcharge kicked in at $300,000.
Under the proposal announced on Tuesday, newly created tax rates would range from 6.45 percent for income between $40,000 and $150,000 (for married couples) to 8.82 percent for income over $2 million. Tax brackets would be indexed to the rate of inflation and would take effect next year. The new top tax bracket would extend through 2014; the others would be permanent.
Under the new brackets, New York's top income tax rate of 8.82 percent would rank among the highest in the country, according to the Federation of Tax Administrators. It would be significantly higher than the top rate in Connecticut, which was raised earlier this year to 6.7 percent, but just under New Jersey's top rate of 8.97 percent.
The agreement would also seek to lower unemployment by financing job-creation programs. It would allocate $50 million to help stricken areas repair flood damage, create an infrastructure fund to finance a new program of road and bridge construction and support job-training programs.
The agreement also reduces a payroll tax that helps finance the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. Mr. Cuomo and the legislative leaders said that the changes would cut taxes by $250 million, and that the state would compensate the transportation authority for the lost revenue.

Full text: JALANDHAR, India -- For multinational merchants like Wal-Mart, it seemed to be the long-awaited opportunity to jump into India with both feet. But on Monday that moment appeared to be delayed once again.
Late last month, as part of a push to modernize his nation's notoriously inefficient retail economy, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh announced that for the first time big foreign companies like Wal-Mart and the British company Tesco could open retail stores in India.
Until now, foreign companies have been restricted to serving only as wholesalers in India. That has already helped create more modern distribution networks, often while generating better prices for farmers and other producers, and giving customers better deals, too.
But expanding the foreign presence to retailing has been seen as the necessary next step for modernists like Mr. Singh, who has been urging the move for years. Praise for his announcement came from India's corporations and some of its 175 million farmers, who see the move as part of a wave of changes that might help jolt a slowing economy.
And opponents -- representing the 34 million people who work in retail and wholesale businesses, as well as left-leaning politicians -- were just as loud.
On Monday, leaders of two opposition parties said Mr. Singh's finance minister, Pranab Mukherjee, had agreed to a delay. Mr. Mukherjee is expected to make a statement in Parliament on Wednesday.
All of this places Wal-Mart in a position hardly new to the company: at the center of a raging debate that pits the multinational giant from Bentonville, Ark., against local mom-and-pop businesses.
For more than a year, Wal-Mart has been operating a wholesale outlet in this northern city known for its fertile farms and hearty food. Local businessmen like Ravi Mahajan, whose family has had a wholesale general store in the narrow alleys of the Imam Nasir market for 40 years, say their sales have been cut in half as their customers -- retail shopkeepers -- stock up at Wal-Mart.
If the government eventually lets foreign firms expand beyond wholesaling to open retail stores, Mr. Mahajan said, many of his retail customers would be forced out of business, while squeezing out traders like himself who have long served as the crucial middleman in Indian commerce.
"We'll be destroyed," Mr. Mahajan said last week, minutes after he and dozens of other traders burned an effigy with a bloated belly and a crudely drawn face, meant to represent multinational marauders.
But Indian business is far from united in opposing foreign retailers.
Farmers like Avtar Singh Sidhu, who sells potatoes to PepsiCo for its Lays chips and has sold baby corn and other vegetables to Wal-Mart's local partner, the Indian conglomerate Bharti, argues that foreign retailers will be a boon to India's struggling agricultural sector. The multinationals, he said, will buy directly from farmers and pay better prices than local wholesalers.
Already, he said, PepsiCo is offering 6 rupees per kilo (or 11 cents) for his potatoes, while local traders offer only 3 rupees (6 cents). "We need more competition," Mr. Sidhu said.
Policy makers are looking for ways to stimulate economic growth, which fell to an annual pace of 6.9 percent in the three months that ended in September. It was the first time India's growth rate had fallen below 7 percent in two years.
The announcement by Mr. Singh's administration on Nov. 24 called for allowing foreign companies like Wal-Mart to team up with Indian partners to open retail stores in metropolitan areas with more than one million people. Jalandhar has 2.1 million people.
The plan ran counter to the views of many politicians who say a slower approach is needed to protect indigenous firms and the rural poor.
But Mr. Singh and his backers have argued that foreign retailers could help reduce chronically high food inflation -- which has run around 10 percent for the last year, on top of 20 percent increases the year before. The retail proposal, proponents say, could improve the lot of the more than a half billion Indians still tied to the land, by improving the supply system from farms to consumers. An estimated one-third of some types of vegetables and fruits rot before ever reaching retail shelves.
Speaking of the Nov. 24 announcement, an adviser to Mr. Singh, Raghuram Rajan, an economist at the University of Chicago, said, "This is a bold move, and I think this is a necessary move."
At present, barely 6 percent of India's $470 billion in retail sales takes place in organized retail stores, according to Technopak, a Indian consulting firm. The rest takes place in small shops. By contrast, organized retail makes up more than 20 percent of sales in China and 36 percent in Brazil -- the two emerging economies to which India most frequently compares itself. (The figure is 85 percent in the United States.)
For decades, Indian regulations and the country's weak infrastructure have favored small shopkeepers. Foreigners, since 1997, have been allowed to participate only in wholesale trading -- a segment in which indigenous operators have historically thrived.
In some cases, the government has granted these traders monopolies. Many Indian states, for instance, require farmers and retailers to sell and buy fruits and vegetables only through wholesale markets controlled by committees of traders.
But Wal-Mart's experience here in the state of Punjab, one of India's richest and long the country's bread basket, provides a glimpse at what could lie ahead for the Indian retail sector.
Two years ago, the company started opening Indian wholesale stores called Best Price, that can sell only to retailers, hotels, restaurants and other businesses. The stores are owned jointly by Wal-Mart and Bharti in a partnership that has four wholesale stores in Punjab, among its 15 total in the country.
Raj Jain, president of Wal-Mart India, said that the partners were now expanding in India's south and west and that Wal-Mart and Bharti had begun discussing plans for a new retail strategy that, he said, would be announced in the "next few months." But it will depend on what government officials say on Wednesday to Parliament.
Wal-Mart, which does not disclose its revenue in India, had about 4,000 employees in the country as of August. The Jalandhar store, which opened in August 2010, looks and feels like Wal-Mart's American outlets, with broad aisles stacked high with merchandise.
Rajat Agarwal, who runs his family's grocery store on a busy market street nearby, said he had come to rely on Best Price because it almost always had the products he sold at his store. Often, he said, traditional wholesalers run out of the most popular brands like Sunsilk shampoo and Aashirvad wheat flour.
Prices also tend to be consistent at Best Price, in contrast to the constant jockeying by the local wholesalers who offer deep discounts when they have too much supply and then push up prices when they are running low.
And yet, Mr. Agarwal complains that the Best Price store has also effectively become a competitor. That is because anybody with a valid business registration can buy from it, and the store has 50,000 member-customers. As a result, in addition to buying supplies for their businesses, many people end up doing their household shopping there, too.
Loading a large consignment of supplies at Best Price one day last week, Mr. Agarwal complained, "This is not a wholesale store." Instead of being able to buy single items, as at a retail store, he said they should be required to buy wholesale quantities. "They should have to buy six or 12," he said.
Sumit Gupta, the Best Price store's manager, said there was little he could do to prevent its members from buying whatever they wanted, as long as they could show that they were registered business owners. The company stocks individual packets of many things, he said, because small retailers demand the option to buy in small quantities.
For now, Mr. Agarwal straddles two commercial worlds.
The morning after stocking up at Best Price, his own shop, Kwality Super Store, was buzzing with customers. Mr. Agarwal and his father, Anil, stood behind the counter. As in most Indian stores, there was no cash register. Mr. Agarwal asked customers to call out the items they were buying, and he hand-tallied the totals on small slips of paper.
One customer, Bhupinder Singh, bought tea, soap, lentils and other supplies. He said he frequented Mr. Agarwal's shop -- but also the Easy Day retail outlet that Bharti has opened down the street.
Easy Day often has prices of up to 10 percent less on packaged goods like biscuits. But he sells the milk from his dairy to the Agarwals, and the family offers him credit on his groceries or offsets his purchases against what it owes him for milk.
Which store he visits, he said, "depends on how I feel that day."

Full text: CHRISTOPHER A. SIMS, a prodigious mathematician and a path-breaking economist, was fast asleep at his home near Princeton University when the telephone rang.
It was early on the morning of Oct. 10, the sun not yet up. A crank call, he figured, and rolled over.
Then the phone rang again. His wife, Cathie, fumbled for the receiver.
"If it's a prank," she whispered, "they're doing a pretty good Swedish accent."
At the same hour, near the campus of New York University in Manhattan, Thomas J. Sargent was already wide awake. He, too, had received an unexpected call.
Stockholm was on the line. The two men, intellectual sparring mates for more than 40 years, had won the Nobel in economic science. (They are to collect it on Saturday.)
And yet, in this time of economic angst, with the fate of the euro and the course of the global economy uncertain, these two Americans have reached the pinnacle of a profession that, to many, seems to have failed miserably. The financial crisis of 2008-09, the Great Recession, the debt mess in Europe -- few economists saw all of it coming. For all its elegance, modern macroeconomics seemed to provide little help when the world needed it most.
Today, solutions to our economic troubles, from onerous government debt to high unemployment, remain elusive. And the field of economics, like Washington politics, seems as polarized as ever.
During the Great Depression, John Maynard Keynes held out remedies. His ideas have shaped many policy makers' thinking ever since. Keynes maintained that market economies are inherently unstable and, if left to their own devices, can self-destruct. Hence governments, he argued, must sometimes intervene.
Mr. Sims and Mr. Sargent neither prescribe cures nor forecast the future. Nor do they deal in the sound bites of talking heads on cable TV. They are reluctant celebrities, men whose work can baffle even Ph.D.'s.
So it comes as a surprise, not least to Mr. Sims and Mr. Sargent, that these two now find themselves thrust into an uncomfortable spotlight. Conservative voices, like the editorial page of The Wall Street Journal, have claimed them as their own. The men's work on economic cause and effect and the theory of rational expectations -- which maintains that people use all the information available in making economic decisions -- proves that Keynes had it wrong, these commentators say.
It would be a provocative thesis -- if it were true. But Mr. Sims and Mr. Sargent say their work is being misread. Both, in fact, are longtime Democrats who maintain that government can, and should, play a role in economic affairs. They stand behind many recent policies of the Obama administration and the Federal Reserve. They even have some ideas about how European governments might defuse the running crisis on the Continent.
They won their Nobel for "their empirical research on cause and effect in the macroeconomy," in the academy's words. What that means, in part, is that they have done some serious math. Today, ideas they largely formed in the 1970s and '80s help shape the thinking inside the Fed and on Wall Street.
Their work goes beyond old labels like Keynesianism and the monetarism of Milton Friedman. They have shown that fiscal and monetary policy are inextricably linked, and their research reflects the broad shift in economics from words to numbers -- toward a level of empirical analysis that few outside the profession can readily grasp. But it contains a kernel of skepticism appropriate for these troubled times. In a world of uncertainty and constraint, cause and effect may not be what they seem. As a result, we must test and retest our assumptions -- and try to prepare for the unexpected.
"The most impressive thing about them as scholars," says David Easley, an economist at Cornell University, "is that in recent years they have questioned the assumptions of the models they helped to create, and they have been at the vanguard of the efforts to go beyond them."
Mr. Sargent says his most important work is spoken "in the beautiful language of math." He knows it's not widely understood.
"The kind of work we do, that real economists do, will never catch on with the public," he says.
THOMAS SARGENT, in a draft of his Nobel acceptance speech, refers to himself as an "American provincial." On a recent afternoon, over a bowl of noodles at an Asian restaurant near N.Y.U. in Greenwich Village, he used football metaphors to discuss economics. He compared fiscal policymakers to coaches, with X's and O's. He often wears T-shirts, sweatshirts and baseball caps, gear as appropriate in Montana, where he keeps a cabin, as it is in Washington Square.
Born in 1943, the son of an insurance salesman and a social worker, Mr. Sargent grew up in Monrovia, Calif., east of Pasadena. He says he didn't cut an impressive figure in high school. "I wasn't the brightest kid, not by a long shot," he says. "I was interested in football, in girls, in getting my work done with the least amount of effort."
Economics? Please. "I think you've got to watch out for anybody in high school who says he wants to become an economist," he says.
And yet, from an early age, Tom Sargent was acquainted with real-world economics. Both of his grandfathers were pretty much wiped out in the Depression, he says.
His classmates at Monrovia High School say he was exceptionally bright -- an academic whiz who also ran track and was president of his junior class. He graduated in three years and headed to the University of California, Berkeley.
There, he took introductory courses in economics and political science, a subject that still fascinates him. He went door to door to campaign for John F. Kennedy and, although his work has been embraced by political conservatives, says he is a lifelong Democrat who fondly remembers "the days when all the Democrats believed in balanced budgets."
Economics, rather than politics, became his life's work partly because of an inspiring teaching assistant named Jerry Kenley. Fifty years later, sitting in his office at N.Y.U., Mr. Sargent remembers his old T.A.
"Jerry liked to say, 'Economics is organized common sense.' I still think that's about right," Mr. Sargent says. Those early classes touched on everything from farm subsidies to taxation. "Wow, it really got me going," he says.
He hasn't been in touch with Mr. Kenley in 50 years. Now retired in California, after a career as a professor in the state university system, Mr. Kenley says: "Tom Sargent was sharp as a tack on every point."
At Berkeley, Mr. Sargent also crossed paths with Hyman Minsky, the business-cycle theorist whose work has returned to vogue since the start of the global financial crisis. Mr. Minsky, who died in 1996, argued that during exuberant periods, financial markets create credit bubbles that eventually lead to credit tightening, downturns and crises -- events now sometimes known as "Minsky moments."
Mr. Minsky was Mr. Sargent's adviser and encouraged him to pursue graduate work at Harvard. "He told me I was capable of succeeding in a place like that," Mr. Sargent said. "I didn't think I could handle it. I didn't have the math."
In retrospect, Mr. Sargent believes that Mr. Minsky's math skills, too, were less developed than they might have been. But at Mr. Minsky's urging, the young man from Monrovia set out for Cambridge, Mass.
WHEN Tom Sargent arrived at Harvard in 1964, Christopher Sims was already turning heads there. Mr. Sims had studied mathematics at Harvard College, then dazzled the economics department as a grad student.
Mr. Sargent says the two weren't close friends then. "He was so brilliant I was afraid to talk to him," Mr. Sargent says.
Mr. Sims wrote his undergraduate thesis on information theory, a subject to which he has returned over the years. In his senior year, he says, he wanted "something more practical" and switched to economics.
It was a natural move. His grandfather William Morris Leiserson was a labor economist and member of the National Labor Relations Board during the administration of Franklin D. Roosevelt. His uncle, Mark Leiserson, a Yale economist, urged him from age 10 to enter the profession.
"It backfired at first," Mr. Sims says, surrounded by books in his Princeton office. "But I guess something stuck."
Great things were expected of him. His math teacher at Greenwich High School in Connecticut, Stephen Willoughby, now a retiree in Tucson, Ariz., says he was a math prodigy. "I always expected Chris would win a Nobel. I just wasn't sure what field it would be."
Mr. Sims's classmates voted him most likely to succeed. "In a class of intelligent people, he was exceptional," says Joyce Tracksler, a high school friend who is now a mystery writer in Kittery Point, Me.
His parents were exceptional, too. His father, Albert, was a diplomat, and young Chris lived in Germany a few years as a child. The family later moved to the Washington suburbs before settling in Greenwich. His father became an executive at the Institute of International Education and at the College Entrance Examination Board in New York. During the Kennedy administration, he helped start the Peace Corps.
Because of his father's College Board connections, Mr. Sims got hold of an old SAT exam, which he and Mr. Willoughby used to conduct a statistical analysis. They found that on multiple-choice questions in English and social studies, the "longer answers tended to be correct." In math, they determined that the number that was "closest to all of the other numerical choices" was probably the right one. Mr. Willoughby says Mr. Sims got perfect scores on SATs, and his teacher assumed that the young man would later "do something involving math, statistics and probability."
Mr. Sims's mother, Ruth, made her own mark in Greenwich. Now ailing, she was president of the League of Women Voters of Connecticut in Mr. Sims's youth and in 1977 became the first Democrat since 1905 and the first woman ever to hold the highest office in town, the position of first selectman.
She won the first of two terms in a runoff after several recounts and reports of possible skulduggery, though never proven, by members of the Republican opposition.
"There isn't much political coloration in my economic writing," Mr. Sims said one afternoon in his Princeton office, looking very much like an older version of the Greenwich boy he was, in a blue oxford button-down shirt, black slacks and moccasins. "It's not surprising that few people know my political views. They really aren't very important."
AS Mr. Sargent tells it, Mr. Sims changed his life. In 1972, Mr. Sims published an article titled "Money, Income, and Causality." Mr. Sargent says he recognized its importance but couldn't follow all of it.
"I spent the next two years learning enough math so that I could make sense of it," he says. "From there, having learned that language, I was able to start asking some questions of my own and to go in my own direction. That paper really got me started."
Around the same time, Mr. Sargent says, he was denied tenure at the University of Pennsylvania and needed a job. Mr. Sims had just taken a position at the University of Minnesota.
"I got a call from Chris," Mr. Sargent says, "and the next week I had an interview and a job offer and my life really went in a great direction." (Mr. Sims says he doesn't remember the details.)
In his office, Mr. Sims translates the paper that sent Mr. Sargent on a math quest. It provided a technique to assess the direction of causality in central bank monetary policy.
Just as monetarists like Mr. Friedman had said, shifts in the money supply affect inflation, the paper showed.
"The monetarists loved it," he recalls. It appeared to confirm their theory that changes in the growth of the money supply determined inflation.
But the paper also helps explain why Mr. Sims has been called an iconoclast. His technique was later used to show that the causality went both ways. "Variables like interest rates and inflation also led to changes in the money supply," he says.
Monetarism has not entirely recovered.
Mr. Sims developed a statistical approach called vector autoregression, or V.A.R. It enables the testing of cause and effect -- whether, for example, the money supply is affecting interest rates, or vice versa. That is a crucial determination if economic models are to have any accuracy, as the Nobel committee has noted.
V.A.R. has become a tool, albeit a highly specialized one, in financial analysis. It's used in some models run by central banks, and, as Aaron Gurwitz, the chief investment officer at Barclays Wealth, says, it has been useful in "helping us understand the patterns in market volatility over time."
Mr. Sims now spends much of his time using information theory -- he compares limits on our ability to process information to the limits on water flow imposed by a pipe -- to expand the horizons of economic modeling. He calls his new approach "rational inattention," and is the first to say that V.A.R. techniques aren't a panacea.
"People have criticized them, saying they didn't give us enough understanding to prevent the financial crisis, and that's true," he says. "But that's like saying, after a teenager gets into an accident, that driver's education failed because the teenager took it and still got into an accident. You'd still want a teenager to take driver's ed."
GOOGLE "Thomas Sargent" and "rational expectations" and you'll get hundreds of hits. Along with Robert E. Lucas Jr. of the University of Chicago, who won the Nobel in 1995, Mr. Sargent is widely considered one of the founders of the theory, though he says it had many earlier proponents, including Keynes.
(Mr. Sargent, formerly of the University of Minnesota, and Mr. Lucas were also often labeled members of the "freshwater" school of economics, partly because of the inland location of their universities. That label makes little sense now, if it ever did, says Mr. Sargent, a Californian transplanted to Manhattan, a "saltwater" enclave.)
Put simply, the idea of rational expectations is that in many economic situations, the outcome depends on what people expect to happen. That might sound obvious today, but in the '70s and '80s, many economic models, based on aspects of Keynesian theory, didn't take expectations into account. Policies informed by those old models may have helped cause the stagflation of the '70s. In 1977, Mr. Sargent wrote a paper, "Is Keynesian Economics a Dead End?", which highlighted such models' flaws.
He attributed many of these failings to economists who adapted Keynes's theories, and not to Keynes himself, whom he considers a great economist. But like Minsky, Keynes "didn't have enough math to really develop his concepts on his own," Mr. Sargent says.
After learning enough to crack Mr. Sims's equations, Mr. Sargent says he realized he needed to know more. A tenured professor at Minnesota at the age of 30, he sat in on higher-level math courses and continued for years. And as the Nobel committee has noted, he has helped to make rational expectations part of mainstream thought and to take econometric modeling to a new level. His book, "The Conquest of American Inflation," is still useful in analyzing prospects for inflation in the current climate, Mr. Gurwitz says.
"Tom Sargent developed a model that shows how policy makers and markets had a meeting of the minds in the '80s, and got inflation under control," he says.
Mr. Sargent not only analyzed changes in central bankers' understanding of the relationship between inflation and unemployment, but he also factored in the financial markets' reaction to changes in policy, and, further, the reaction of the policy makers to the reaction of the markets.
"It's a beautiful model," Mr. Gurwitz says, "and it helps us understand what's going on today."
Still, Mr. Sargent has his critics. In a blog post at the market nadir in March 2009, for example, Willem Buiter, now chief economist of Citigroup, said Mr. Sargent was among the scholars whose theories had left the profession "unprepared when the crisis struck." Mr. Buiter would not comment for this article.
Mr. Sargent is tough on himself, saying the "rational expectations approach" and the techniques he has helped to pioneer don't yet capture economic reality. How do people really think, as individuals and in a market? How should we account for changes in expectations as people learn? How should we incorporate human thinking more realistically into economic models? He's grappling with such questions, seeking more sophisticated techniques that incorporate what he calls the theory of "adaptive learning."
His own assumptions need to be continually re-examined "to capture a fundamentally uncertain, constrained, complicated world," he says.
Simon Potter, director of economic research at the New York Federal Reserve, says he has taken Mr. Sargent's message to heart: "Our profession hasn't reached the stage where it can reliably forecast the economy," Mr. Potter says. "Our collective failure to do so in the financial crisis shows this."
And so, he says, "we at the Fed have been using the teachings of Thomas Sargent to 'tweak our models' and build in alternative assumptions." The point is to "ratchet down our forecasts," he says, and try to prepare for "less obvious, less easily expected outcomes."
WHILE neither Mr. Sims nor Mr. Sargent gives much prescriptive advice about the current economic malaise, both have already given guidance about the global crisis -- providing advance warning of serious consequences if policy makers fail to understand the links between monetary and fiscal policy.
In a prescient paper more than a decade ago, Mr. Sims warned of disaster to come in the euro zone if a new central bank wasn't accompanied by a unified fiscal authority. To avoid disaster now, he says, the European Central Bank must show a willingness "to act as a lender of last resort" in Europe. If that happens, he says, markets may be able to stabilize long enough for Europeans to study a long "menu" of accompanying fiscal and political arrangements.
Mr. Sargent has also written extensively about "budget constraints" and monetary policy. One influential study, "Some Unpleasant Monetarist Arithmetic," written with Neil Wallace of Penn State, says a central bank will eventually run out of ammunition if the government fails to manage its debt. That analysis applies to the United States today, Mr. Sargent says.
"There are many choices open to us here," he says. "But at some point the market will have to be convinced that the government can handle its debt."
As for the euro, he says he will provide a few possible answers in his Nobel speech on Saturday. His draft is a scholarly, 40-page, footnoted, annotated paper. "There isn't much about Europe in it," he acknowledges. "They don't want advice from an American, really."
The paper contains an explication of rational expectations econometric theory, written in English and math, and an astute fiscal and monetary history of the United States in its early days.
Mr. Sargent notes that the United States moved from loose confederation to federal union -- the arrangement embodied in the Constitution -- in large part because of a crippling debt crisis. The parallels with Europe seem clear. Is he calling for a federal Europe?
"Maybe," he says. "I'm pointing out the constraints and the possibilities."

Abstract: Can it be that Latin America is now a solid investment, as the middle class in many of the countries increasingly becomes a driving force? Or is the region's cycle of booms and busts set to repeat itself? Francisco Alzuru, managing director of emerging market research at Hansberger Global Investors, said countries like Brazil and Mexico had reduced their debt-to-G.D.P. ratios significantly in the last decade, to levels better than in the developed world.

Full text: I SPENT the late 1990s and early 2000s reporting on the financial crises in Latin America, when Argentina, overwhelmed by foreign debts, defaulted and Brazil narrowly avoided the same fate. But in the last month or so, Latin America kept coming up in conversations I had with various money managers and investment strategists as a place that has new opportunities.
What happened? Can it be that Latin America is now a solid investment, as the middle class in many of the countries increasingly becomes a driving force? Or is the region's cycle of booms and busts set to repeat itself?
Anyone who invested broadly in the region's main stock indexes has had a bad year. Brazil's index is down 16 percent, Mexico's is down 5 percent and Chile's is down about 16 percent. These numbers are worse for international investors because all three countries' currencies have fallen against the dollar.
Not surprisingly, investors have been pulling their money out. As of Dec. 2 they had taken $9.8 billion out of Latin America, according to fund flow data compiled by Morgan Stanley research. (Emerging markets in general have not fared well this year, with investors taking out $36.6 billion.)
But, at the same time, companies as diverse as Siemens, General Electric, Nissan and Halliburton have increased their operations in Brazil.
China is Brazil's major trading partner, which would seem to augur well. But it is selling commodities like iron ore, which could suffer if China's growth continued to slow.
Yet Brazil also has a growing consumer sector. Sergio Cabral, the governor of the state of Rio de Janeiro, told me that almost 40 million people in Brazil had entered the middle class in the last five years. (Gerardo Zamorano, a director at Brandes Investment Partners, put that number at 25 million to 30 million, which is still a striking number given that Brazil had almost no middle class when I was there.) And Governor Cabral said that demand for all types of consumer goods was far outstripping supply in his state.
"Prices are crazy," he said on a visit to New York this week. "We need more hotels. We have a suite problem -- we have demand but we need more supply."
That is a good thing as long as inflation does not increase and erode the buying power of the new middle class. Inflation has historically been a huge problem in Brazil, running to triple digits in the 1980s and 1990s. Official estimates now put it at a comparatively low 6.5 percent.
What's an investor to do, with so many contradictory measures? Here are some thoughts.
THE CHANGE Ten years ago this week, Jim O'Neill, chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset Management, coined the term BRIC, elevating the profile of four countries -- Brazil, Russia, India and China -- that he thought were poised to become "growth economies." He argued at the time that these countries contributed 8 percent of global gross domestic product and that in 10 years, their economies would account for about 14 percent. They're now at 18 to 19 percent.
Mr. O'Neill said this week that he was surprised at how well Brazil had done, overtaking Italy to become the seventh-largest economy in the world.
"I found it really easy to be bullish about Brazil over the past decade," he said. "I describe myself now as being a little bit more reserved. The biggest risk is if inflation were to get out of hand. There is no way you're going to get the continued increases among the middle class if that happens."
By Brazilian standards, he noted, inflation is low. Even if some analysts think it is above the 6.5 percent target rate, the central bank cut interest rates on Wednesday for the third time this year, a sign it is not concerned about inflation.
Francisco Alzuru, managing director of emerging market research at Hansberger Global Investors, said countries like Brazil and Mexico had reduced their debt-to-G.D.P. ratios significantly in the last decade, to levels better than in the developed world. And both countries, he said, had learned hard lessons from the crises of the 1990s that drove down the value of their currencies and pushed up the cost of borrowing.
"This time, they have growth from the benefit of sound macroeconomic policy," he said. "I don't want to imply that Latin America is risk-free and we can invest with our eyes closed. But from a macroeconomic perspective, the boom and bust should be better managed."
In a sign of how far Latin American economies have come since the late 1990s, an official in Brazil's finance ministry said this week that the country would not make any decision on aid to Europe during a visit from the head of the International Monetary Fund. It wasn't too long ago that Brazil was on the receiving end of such bailouts.
THE OPPORTUNITIES Jamie Kramer, head of the thematic advisory practice at J. P. Morgan Private Bank, tells her clients interested in investing in Latin America to look for the "emerging markets of the future with their emerging middle class."
This is not as easy as it sounds. She noted that exchange-traded funds on the Brazilian index are often heavily weighted with energy and financial services companies, a different bet entirely.
Mr. Zamorano said he had focused on investing in wireless telecommunications and consumer product companies. He noted that when a consumer was going from $500 in annual income to $800, "you're still subsistence." But, he said, "Once you're getting to $5,000, $10,000 you're seeing car consumption, broadband, consumer products going up. That's a phase we're seeing."
Mr. Alzuru said there were opportunities to invest in what the middle class in Mexico needed most -- housing and all the related industries from mortgages to construction.
"In the U.S., we have a saturated market," he said. "In Mexico, the need for houses, the accumulated deficit is in the millions of units. You have 10 years of pending demand for homes."
THE RISKS Beyond inflation, investors should be wary of any economy significantly dependent on exports.
The State Department said 80 percent of Mexico's exports went to the United States in 2010, for instance, and the sluggishness of the American economy had slowed Mexico's growth. The same fate is feared for Brazil and China. Chile is a big exporter of wine, flour, lithium and copper, while Peru exports various minerals, like copper, silver and gold. Such dependence on exports wreaked havoc in the 1990s.
There is also political risk. Venezuela, under the leadership of President Hugo Chavez, is economically worse off than it was 10 years ago, despite immense oil wealth. And Argentina is enduring high inflation, 9.8 percent as of October, which many analysts, including Mr. Alzuru, attribute to ineffective government policies.
But Mr. Zamorano said relatively high interest rates meant the governments had the ability to cut rates to stimulate growth, if needed -- something developed countries like the United States or Japan can no longer do.
Governor Cabral said he was most worried about the slow development of roads, ports and airports in his state and Brazil in general. "In Brazil, for more money to be invested, you have to open more services, concessions, airports," he said. "I'm concerned Brazil has to speed up the infrastructure to attract more investment."
His goal is to wean his state from its dependence on energy, which he recognizes as volatile, and focus more on technology and education.
Back when I was there, Latin America's economies were hard to tell apart. But now, they present as many opportunities and pitfalls as any other investment.

Abstract: According to figures of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the German savings rate was more than 10 percent every year between 2003 and 2009, while during the same period it bottomed out at 1.5 percent in the United States, and never rose above 6.2 percent.

Full text: BERLIN -- Norbert Schulze was not yet born when the hyperinflation of the 1920s deeply scarred the German psyche. But he still remembers the Reichsmark notes denominated in millions and billions that years later were tucked into a box with the family's old black-and-white photographs.
Now, Mr. Schulze, a 56-year-old auto mechanic, says runaway inflation looms again, threatening to decimate his savings and turn his carefully planned retirement into abject poverty. It is not so much the ghost of the 1920s that he fears, but the vocal demands around Europe and abroad for a "big bazooka" of public money to reassure markets and help European countries in heavy debt.
"I'm worried about my pension and my savings and the problems we're facing right now," Mr. Schulze said.
Many economists say aggressive purchases of the sovereign bonds of heavily indebted states by the European Central Bank are the quickest and surest path to stabilizing the crisis. On Thursday, Mario Draghi, the bank's president, laid the groundwork for bolder intervention in markets if certain conditions were met.
To German ears those bond purchases, or anything that smacks of printing money, sound like a recipe for skyrocketing prices. German leaders, including Chancellor Angela Merkel and her former economic adviser, Jens Weidmann, now head of the German Bundesbank, have strongly discouraged any such move by the European Central Bank, stalling the rescue of the euro zone in the view of critics.
The prospect of a dim historical memory -- the antique photograph of the wheelbarrow full of nearly worthless bills -- helping to drive the world off the economic precipice and into another deep recession may seem like the height of irrationality and even irresponsibility.
But the German obsession with inflation has been difficult to overcome because Germans perceive themselves as more vulnerable to inflation today than their neighbors are. It is a force they believe could reduce or wipe out the competitive and financial edge they have labored to build.
By robbing a currency of its value, inflation wipes the slate clean for debtors and savers alike. Germans say they like the slate the way it is because they are on the plus side of the ledger.
Consumer debt, whether credit cards or in many cases even home mortgages, is frowned upon here. According to figures of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the German savings rate was more than 10 percent every year between 2003 and 2009, while during the same period it bottomed out at 1.5 percent in the United States, and never rose above 6.2 percent. As a result German households had net savings of $4.3 trillion, according to the Bundesbank, in a country of fewer than 82 million people.
Germans own homes at a lower rate, 41.6 percent, than the 66.3 percent of Americans who do. And most people do not invest in the stock market here.
"For the average American, inflation means the home price is increasing and the value of debt is going down," said Peter Bofinger, a prominent economist on Mrs. Merkel's independent council of economic advisers, "whereas the German invested in life insurance and sitting in an apartment he rented is much more vulnerable to inflation."
Fear of inflation is a deep and broad consensus in Germany, but one that Sebastian Dullien, an economist and senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said had worsened appreciably in recent years. "It is not about the 1920s," Mr. Dullien said. "The fear of inflation went up when wages stopped going up."
In an effort to regain lost competitiveness over the past decade, Germany went through a period of wage restraint and labor-market reforms that made the hiring and firing of workers easier and welfare benefits less generous. While countries on Europe's southern edge, including Greece and Portugal, were enjoying the cheap money that came with membership in the euro, Germans were developing a newfound sense of economic insecurity, one that paired all too effectively with an old dread.
That has real policy consequences. Kenneth S. Rogoff, a Harvard professor and former chief economist for the International Monetary Fund, has argued that the euro zone needs higher inflation of between 4 percent and 6 percent, well above the European Central Bank's fixed target of 2 percent. "German leaders have told me they have a lot of leeway in a lot of dimensions, but the hot-button issue they cannot touch is inflation," Mr. Rogoff said. "Inflation is poison to them."
German magazines and newspapers regularly go to press with covers featuring euro coins and bills that are melting or in flames. This week's Spiegel magazine shows a one-euro coin cracked in two halves under dark storm clouds with the words "And now?" Its competitor, the magazine Focus, has a 13-page feature on rising prices since the euro currency was introduced to consumers a decade ago.
"If I believed everything I read I would have to take a rope and hang myself," said Helga Matthes, 59, a retired Lufthansa flight attendant. "My 85-year-old mother reads the newspaper every morning and has pains in her stomach. She tells me, 'We're going to lose everything again.' "
Woven together with historical memories and the German obsession with stability and safety, the mental block on inflation can be hard to slip. In the collective consciousness, hyperinflation stands as an important milepost in the slide to total catastrophe culminating with the total defeat of the Nazis in 1945.
But Adolf Hitler came to power in the wake of deflation, not inflation. The German economy shrank 7.7 percent in 1931 and 7.5 percent in 1932 under the watch of Heinrich Bruning, known as the hunger chancellor, who enacted harsh austerity measures that deepened the depression.
Economists who favor stimulus policies, and in particular action by the European Central Bank, say the German focus on inflation is woefully misplaced during a time of little or no growth and severe market turmoil. They say there are too many similarities between the cuts made by Mr. Bruning and those Mrs. Merkel has demanded of euro zone partners.
"There are historic parallels between deflation and the 1930s and what's going on today, none with hyperinflation," said Fabian Lindner, an economist at the Macroeconomic Policy Institute in Dusseldorf. Mr. Lindner pointed out that it was the middle class, with carefully gathered nest eggs to lose, more than the working class that lost out in the hyperinflation, searing the memory in the minds of an entire generation of teachers, academics and journalists who in turn would pass it on.
Under Hitler, the Nazi rearmament and jobs programs, including highway construction, quickly led to full employment. A second period of significant inflation was covered up by rationing and price controls until after the war, when the Reichsmark was exchanged for the Deutsche mark at roughly 10 to 1 in 1948, the second time savings were wiped out in a quarter century.
"Inflation, you see it, you almost smell it," said Tobias Straumann, an economic historian at the University of Zurich. "People don't understand that deflation is monetary stuff. They think it's bad luck, a development that can't be explained."
As the current crisis has deepened and the reality has begun to hit home that a breakup of the euro is a possibility, the German news media have begun to confront the considerable costs, and risks, that would come with a breakup of the currency union, raising hopes that a solution is within reach.
Mr. Schulze, who after his heart attack sold the family auto-repair business where he now works as an employee, said that for all his concerns about inflation, "There is no other way other than to try to rescue the euro. Whether or not it works. ..." he said, his words trailing off, the sentence unfinished.

Full text: FRANKFURT -- Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, laid the groundwork for a more aggressive response to the debt crisis Thursday, suggesting that the bank could increase its support for the European economy if political leaders took more radical steps to enforce spending discipline among members.
In the run-up to a meeting of European leaders late next week, Mr. Draghi's remarks seemed to be part of a larger effort by the bank and the region's biggest economic powers -- Germany and France -- to lay the foundation for a broader rescue without seeming to compromise their principles.
Later in the day Thursday, the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy -- acknowledging the region's debt crisis -- announced that he and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, would meet in Paris on Monday "to make French-German propositions to guarantee the future of Europe."
Last weekend, Germany and France began floating a plan to hold member nations of the euro currency union more financially accountable to their fellow members by giving European Union officials the power to vet and approve their national budgets. Euro zone agreement to such a proposal is seen as a possible precondition to increased financing by the central bank, to which Germany and France are the biggest contributors.
Mr. Draghi, in the manner of central bankers, made no explicit promises on Thursday. And the quid pro quo he offered governments was indirect. But his remarks illuminated how the bank might answer increasingly desperate calls for the bank to escalate its intervention in bond markets without violating its own mandate or alienating Germany, where opposition to a central bank bailout of Greece or Italy continues to run deep.
Speaking to the European Parliament in Brussels, Mr. Draghi stopped well short of offering a European version of the sort of large securities purchases that the United States Federal Reserve has used to try stimulating the American economy.
But he seemed to be saying that the bank would use its virtually unlimited resources to keep financial markets at bay, if government leaders in the euro region agreed to do their part by addressing the structural flaws that had allowed the debt problems of Greece to mutate into a threat to the global economy.
"What I believe our economic and monetary union needs is a new fiscal compact," Mr. Draghi said. "It is time to adapt the euro area design with a set of institutions, rules and processes that is commensurate with the requirements of monetary union."
After government leaders take steps to improve the way the euro area is managed, "other elements might follow," Mr. Draghi said. European leaders will hold a summit meeting on Dec. 9, which is now seen as the latest deadline -- there have been many during the nearly two-year debt struggle -- for stemming the crisis.
Europe appeared to have bought a bit more time on Wednesday, when the Federal Reserve, the central bank and four other national central banks agreed to free up more dollar lending to European banks. But the stock market rally that followed that move did not carry over to Thursday -- although successful government bond auctions in Spain and France did indicate at least a temporary calm in the debt storm.
By insisting that greater action would depend on rules to enforce spending discipline among euro members, Mr. Draghi might at least partly address German concerns that greater central bank action would reward countries that have mismanaged their finances and violate a prohibition against financing governments.
"Mr. Draghi appeared to be holding up the possibility of a greater degree of E.C.B. intervention if euro area governments were to commit, at next week's key E.U. summit, to a tougher set of fiscal rules," analysts at Barclays Capital said in a research note.
After insisting for weeks that the central bank is not authorized, under the European Union treaty, to bail out national governments, Mr. Draghi on Thursday hinted at how the treaty mandate might nonetheless let the central bank to do just that. He noted that the mandate required it to ensure price stability "in either direction."
Typically, the bank has seen its main job as keeping a lid on inflation. But "either direction" might mean that if inflation fell below the central bank's official target of about 2 percent, it would be required to take action to prevent deflation. That would be justification for the central bank to do what so many experts have been urging: buy government bonds on the open market in greater amounts. That would effectively ease the debt crisis for those governments, while also stimulating the euro zone economy by pumping hundreds of billions of euros into it -- printing money, as economists call it.
Although the current annual rate of inflation in the euro zone is 3 percent, Mr. Draghi gave a gloomy assessment of the economy and said inflationary pressures were easing. A survey released by the bank Thursday showed that small- and medium-size business were having increasing trouble obtaining bank loans. "This autumn, tensions in financial markets have intensified again with very adverse effects on financing conditions and confidence," Mr. Draghi said.
To be sure, Mr. Draghi would probably still face an outcry from Germany if the bank appeared to be printing money. Reflecting that country's deep aversion to inflation, Mrs. Merkel and Jens Weidmann, the president of the Bundesbank, have rejected any big increase in the central bank's relatively modest purchases of government bonds.
Germans account for just two of the 23 members of the bank's governing council, which makes most decisions by majority vote. But though the Germans could easily be overruled, other members of the council would be taking a huge political risk if they alienated the euro area's largest and richest country.
As a first step, many analysts expect the bank's governing council to cut interest rates when it meets on Dec. 8, the day before the summit meeting. In addition, there is speculation that it may expand its emergency lending to commercial banks, which are having trouble raising money through usual channels. Wednesday's deal with the Fed and other banks to offer more low-cost dollar loans to the central bank should help it lend more liberally to European banks.
Mr. Draghi cautioned that its market interventions were limited and temporary, suggesting that the central bank was unlikely to buy securities on the same scale as the Fed, which since it began its easy-money campaign of so-called quantitative easing following the 2008 financial crisis, has bought up more than $2 trillion in government debt and mortgage-backed securities.
Bond purchases by the central bank, begun in May 2010, so far amount to only about 200 billion euros ($269 billion). Some proponents of greater bond-buying have suggested that the central bank should stand ready to buy as much as 1 trillion euros' worth.
Whether the bank would agree to intervene at anything close to that scale remains to be seen.
But Mr. Draghi made it clear that any action after that would depend on commitments from governments.
"The sequencing matters," he said. "And it is first and foremost important to get a commonly shared fiscal compact right. Confidence works backwards. If there is an anchor in the long term, it is easier to maintain trust in the short term."

Abstract: People see lobbyists diverting money on the basis of connections; they see traders making millions off of short-term manipulations; they see governments stealing money from future generations to reward current voters. The estimated costs of these bailouts vary enormously and may end up being greater than the cost of German reparations after World War I. Germans are being browbeaten for not wanting to bail out Greece, where even today many people are still not willing to pay their taxes.

Full text: Why are nations like Germany and the U.S. rich? It's not primarily because they possess natural resources -- many nations have those. It's primarily because of habits, values and social capital.
It's because many people in these countries, as Arthur Brooks of the American Enterprise Institute has noted, believe in a simple moral formula: effort should lead to reward as often as possible.
People who work hard and play by the rules should have a fair shot at prosperity. Money should go to people on the basis of merit and enterprise. Self-control should be rewarded while laziness and self-indulgence should not. Community institutions should nurture responsibility and fairness.
This ethos is not an immutable genetic property, which can blithely be taken for granted. It's a precious social construct, which can be undermined and degraded.
Right now, this ethos is being undermined from all directions. People see lobbyists diverting money on the basis of connections; they see traders making millions off of short-term manipulations; they see governments stealing money from future generations to reward current voters.
The result is a crisis of legitimacy. The game is rigged. Social trust shrivels. Effort is no longer worth it. The prosperity machine winds down.
Yet the assault on these values continues, especially in Europe.
Over the past few decades, several European nations, like Germany and the Netherlands, have played by the rules and practiced good governance. They have lived within their means, undertaken painful reforms, enhanced their competitiveness and reinforced good values. Now they are being brutally browbeaten for not wanting to bail out nations like Greece, Italy and Spain, which did not do these things, which instead borrowed huge amounts of money that they are choosing not to repay.
The estimated costs of these bailouts vary enormously and may end up being greater than the cost of German reparations after World War I. Germans are being browbeaten for not wanting to bail out Greece, where even today many people are still not willing to pay their taxes. They are being browbeaten for not wanting to bail out Italy, where future growth prospects are uncertain.
They are being asked to bail out nations with vast public sectors and horrible demographics. They are being asked to paper over fundamental economic problems with a mountain of currency.
It's true that Germans benefited enormously from the euro zone and the southern European bubble, and that German and French banks are far from blameless. It's true that the consequences for the world would be calamitous if the euro zone cracked up. It's true that, in a crisis, you do things you wouldn't otherwise do; you do things that violate your everyday values.
But our sympathy should be with the German people. They are not behaving selfishly by insisting on structural reforms in exchange for bailouts. They are not imprisoned by some rigid ideology. They are not besotted with some semi-senile Weimar superstition about rampant inflation. They are defending the values, habits and social contract upon which the entire prosperity of the West is based.
The scariest thing is that many of the people browbeating the Germans seem to have very little commitment to the effort-reward formula that undergirds capitalism. On the one hand, there are the technicians who are oblivious to values. For them anything that can't be counted and modeled is a primitive irrelevancy. On the other hand, there are people who see the European crisis through the prism of some cosmic class war. What matters is not how people conduct themselves, but whether they are a have or a have-not. The burden of proof is against the haves. The benefit of the doubt is with the have-nots. Any resistance to redistribution is greeted with outrage.
The real lesson from financial crises is that, at the pit of the crisis, you do what you have to do. You bail out the banks. You bail out the weak European governments. But, at the same time, you lock in policies that reinforce the fundamental link between effort and reward. And, as soon as the crisis passes, you move to repair the legitimacy of the system.
That didn't happen after the American financial crisis of 2008. The people who caused the crisis were never held responsible. There never was an exit strategy to unwind the gigantic debt buildup. The structural problems plaguing the economy remain unaddressed. As a result, the United States suffers from a horrible crisis of trust that is slowing growth, restricting government action and sending our politics off in strange directions.
Europe's challenge is not only to avert a financial meltdown but to do it in a way that doesn't poison the seedbed of prosperity. Which values will be rewarded and reinforced? Will it be effort, productivity and self-discipline? Or will it be bad governance, now and forever?

Full text: GRAND PURSUIT
The Story of Economic Genius
By Sylvia Nasar
558 pages. Simon & Schuster. $35.
As Sylvia Nasar tells it, the story of "the dismal science" of economics is a bright one of onward and upward progress. Never mind that Irving Fisher and John Maynard Keynes, two of the central figures in this book, were blindsided by the Great Crash of 1929. Never mind that lessons from the Great Depression and the warnings of a few farsighted economists were ignored by Wall Street in recent years, leading to another harrowing crash in 2008 and lingering fiscal woes.
In Ms. Nasar's view the story of economics over the last century and a half is a story about great thinkers devising tools of analysis, ideas that would give mankind at least some level of mastery over conditions of misery and want once thought to be immutable and "utterly beyond human control or influence."
"Economic calamities -- financial panics, hyperinflations, depressions, social conflicts and wars -- have always triggered crises of confidence, but they have not come close to wiping out the cumulative gains in average living standards," she writes. After World War II, she goes on, "growth rebounded and living standards shot up" and "history has been dominated by the escape of more and more of the world's population from abject poverty."
In her haphazard new book "Grand Pursuit," Ms. Nasar says she set out to tell that story through the lives of "protagonists who were instrumental in turning economics into an instrument of mastery." Unfortunately her selection of those people is so arbitrary-- she says she "chose men and women with 'cool heads but warm hearts' " whose "temperaments, experiences and genius led them, in response to their own times and places, to ask new questions and propose new answers" -- that the book fails to give the lay reader an overarching understanding of how modern economic thinking has evolved, or how major schools of thought have fared in light of various political and fiscal developments.
Ms. Nasar spends a lot of space talking about Keynes and his disciples, for instance, but fails to put his views fully in context. There is little discussion of Adam Smith and his laissez-faire philosophy, which stands in such contrast to Keynes's belief in the often necessary role of government. And while Milton Friedman's early days as a Keynesian and supporter of the New Deal are mentioned, there is no real examination of his evolution into an influential champion of free markets.
What Ms. Nasar does brilliantly here -- much as she did in "A Beautiful Mind," her absorbing 1998 biography of the mathematician John Forbes Nash Jr. -- is give us intimate portraits of her subjects, tracing the ways in which personal experiences informed their thinking. Ms. Nasar -- a former economics correspondent for The New York Times who is now a professor at the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism -- writes with ease and authority about complicated economic matters, but shows even more fluency evoking the inner lives of her subjects and the social worlds they transited.
Ms. Nasar gives us Belle Epoque Vienna -- infatuated with modernity and challenging London in the race to electrify with new telephone service, state-of-the-art factories and power-driven trams -- and then a devastating picture of Vienna at the end of World War I: war veterans loitering outside restaurants waiting for scraps, and desperate members of a middle class that saw inflation wipe out all its savings trading a piano for a sack of flour, a gold watch chain for a few sacks of potatoes.
She conjures the heady, intellectual world of Cambridge in the 1930s, when Keynes's disciples orbited him like planets around the Sun, and she captures the air of intrigue that surrounded the 1944 Bretton Woods conference, which created a global interventionist framework centered around the World Bank and International Monetary Fund: the "slightly seedy" New Hampshire resort packed with 730 delegates from 44 Allied countries and "crawling with spies."
In the course of the book the reader gets a vague sense of how the horrors of World War I, the Depression and World War II taught economists practical lessons about the functioning of fiscal policy and relationships among countries.
The great innovation of the 1920s and '30s "taught that what was good for one nation might easily be bad for all. Devaluing one's currency, erecting trade barriers and clamping controls on capital outflows might be effective for reducing balance-of-payment deficits, stopping the outflow of gold and pumping up government revenues," Ms. Nasar writes. "But if everybody adopted the same tactics, the eventual result would be universal impoverishment and unemployment."
By the time of Bretton Woods, Ms. Nasar goes on, a kind of global Keynesian had been widely embraced: it would be "commonly acknowledged that keeping free enterprise functioning globally required the visible hand of government."
Because of its discursive, disorganized structure, "Grand Pursuit" is read best not as a primer on the emergence of modern economics, but as a sort of Selected Lives of the Economists. Ms. Nasar introduces us to Alfred Marshall, whose own metamorphosis from scholarship boy to Cambridge don informed his "optimism about the improvability of man and his circumstances." We meet Irving Fisher, the Yale economist, who argued, that "individual action would never give rise to a system of city parks, or even to any useful system of streets." And Beatrice Webb, of whom Ms. Nasar writes: "No one had a greater claim to the invention of the idea of a government safety net -- indeed, the modern welfare state" than she did.
Among the more compelling portraits in this volume is that of Joseph Alois Schumpeter, the brilliant European economist who argued that the distinctive feature of capitalism was "incessant innovation" -- a "perennial gale of creative destruction" -- and who identified the entrepreneur as the visionary who could "revolutionize the pattern of production by exploiting an invention" or "an untried technological possibility."
Although Ms. Nasar does a concise job of explicating what her various subjects thought about the role government should play in regulating the markets -- as well as their thoughts about the causes and possible solutions to problems like unemployment and inflation -- she does little to show the reader how their theories might shed light on the current economic difficulties of the United States and Europe: another disappointment in this immensely gifted writer's ungainly, though sometimes inspired, book.

Full text: Can the euro be saved? Not long ago we were told that the worst possible outcome was a Greek default. Now a much wider disaster seems all too likely.
True, market pressure lifted a bit on Wednesday after central banks made a splashy announcement about expanded credit lines (which will, in fact, make hardly any real difference). But even optimists now see Europe as headed for recession, while pessimists warn that the euro may become the epicenter of another global financial crisis.
How did things go so wrong? The answer you hear all the time is that the euro crisis was caused by fiscal irresponsibility. Turn on your TV and you're very likely to find some pundit declaring that if America doesn't slash spending we'll end up like Greece. Greeeeeece!
But the truth is nearly the opposite. Although Europe's leaders continue to insist that the problem is too much spending in debtor nations, the real problem is too little spending in Europe as a whole. And their efforts to fix matters by demanding ever harsher austerity have played a major role in making the situation worse.
The story so far: In the years leading up to the 2008 crisis, Europe, like America, had a runaway banking system and a rapid buildup of debt. In Europe's case, however, much of the lending was across borders, as funds from Germany flowed into southern Europe. This lending was perceived as low risk. Hey, the recipients were all on the euro, so what could go wrong?
For the most part, by the way, this lending went to the private sector, not to governments. Only Greece ran large budget deficits during the good years; Spain actually had a surplus on the eve of the crisis.
Then the bubble burst. Private spending in the debtor nations fell sharply. And the question European leaders should have been asking was how to keep those spending cuts from causing a Europe-wide downturn.
Instead, however, they responded to the inevitable, recession-driven rise in deficits by demanding that all governments -- not just those of the debtor nations -- slash spending and raise taxes. Warnings that this would deepen the slump were waved away. "The idea that austerity measures could trigger stagnation is incorrect," declared Jean-Claude Trichet, then the president of the European Central Bank. Why? Because "confidence-inspiring policies will foster and not hamper economic recovery."
But the confidence fairy was a no-show.
Wait, there's more. During the years of easy money, wages and prices in southern Europe rose substantially faster than in northern Europe. This divergence now needs to be reversed, either through falling prices in the south or through rising prices in the north. And it matters which: If southern Europe is forced to deflate its way to competitiveness, it will both pay a heavy price in employment and worsen its debt problems. The chances of success would be much greater if the gap were closed via rising prices in the north.
But to close the gap through rising prices in the north, policy makers would have to accept temporarily higher inflation for the euro area as a whole. And they've made it clear that they won't. Last April, in fact, the European Central Bank began raising interest rates, even though it was obvious to most observers that underlying inflation was, if anything, too low.
And it's probably no coincidence that April was also when the euro crisis entered its new, dire phase. Never mind Greece, whose economy is to Europe roughly as greater Miami is to the United States. At this point, markets have lost faith in the euro as a whole, driving up interest rates even for countries like Austria and Finland, hardly known for profligacy. And it's not hard to see why. The combination of austerity-for-all and a central bank morbidly obsessed with inflation makes it essentially impossible for indebted countries to escape from their debt trap and is, therefore, a recipe for widespread debt defaults, bank runs and general financial collapse.
I hope, for our sake as well as theirs, that the Europeans will change course before it's too late. But, to be honest, I don't believe they will. In fact, what's much more likely is that we will follow them down the path to ruin.
For in America, as in Europe, the economy is being dragged down by troubled debtors -- in our case, mainly homeowners. And here, too, we desperately need expansionary fiscal and monetary policies to support the economy as these debtors struggle back to financial health. Yet, as in Europe, public discourse is dominated by deficit scolds and inflation obsessives.
So the next time you hear someone claiming that if we don't slash spending we'll turn into Greece, your answer should be that if we do slash spending while the economy is still in a depression, we'll turn into Europe. In fact, we're well on our way.

Full text: Nearly three years ago they were "Younger Than Jesus." Now that generation of emerging artists (born between the mid-1970s and the mid-'80s) is being called "The Ungovernables," at least by curators at the New Museum, organizing its second Triennial.
"I wanted a title that has more than one side," said Eungie Joo, the New Museum's director and curator of education and public programs, who has organized the 2012 Triennial. "It's a term inspired by the 1976 student uprisings in South Africa," Ms. Joo said. "It could be defined as chaotic or anarchic, but it could also refer to an organized resistance." The word ungovernable came to define an official strategy of the African National Congress in 1986, she added.
The exhibition will run from Feb. 15 to April 22. It will take up the museum's entire building, on the Bowery between Stanton and Rivington Streets on the Lower East Side, and include more than 50 participants, or about 34 artists, artist groups and temporary collectives.
The show is a result of two years, hundreds of studio visits and travel to more than 20 countries. "I wanted to go places where there is an international cultural scene," Ms. Joo said. In her journeys -- to Hong Kong, Johannesburg, Buenos Aires, Stockholm and other cities -- some common threads appeared, including issues of economic turbulence and political commentary. "The subtlety of the work is important," Ms. Joo said. "There is no overt or confrontational agenda, but rather these artists are making comments that are of their time in a particularly pragmatic way."
Lisa Phillips, director of the New Museum, said that many of the recent biennials in places like Shanghai and Sao Paulo have had an international influence on art and by extension on the Triennial. "While these artists are deeply sensitive to the political landscape, we're not seeing the kind of strident doctrinaire views that we've seen in previous generations," she said
In addition to installations, videos and conceptual pieces -- the most popular art forms for this generation -- there will be more traditional paintings, drawings and sculptures.
Drawings, Ms. Joo said, will be present more than is usually the case in sprawling survey shows. Rita Ponce de Leon, a Peruvian who lives and works in Mexico City, for instance, will be showing about 120 tiny ink drawings. The drawings depict dreams and memories from some of her friends and family.
Iman Issa, an Egyptian-born artist living in Cairo and New York, has created a series of sculptures that are about the essence of monuments. The Vietnamese-born Danh Vo, who works in Berlin, is also thinking about monuments, but in a different way. When he learned that the Statue of Liberty was simply a steel armature covered by a copper skin the thickness of two pennies, he researched the hammering process that gave her shape, then employed craftsmen to replicate the statue's skin for his work "We the People."
"It's really about what those monuments have come to represent," Ms. Joo said, "and the way their meanings change over time."
A MANET FOR THE GETTY
When Manet showed a woman known only as Madame Brunet a portrait he had painted of her, she reportedly burst into tears and "left the studio with her husband, never wanting to see the portrait again," according to Theodore Duret, a French art critic of the time. So the artist kept the portrait for two decades, until his death in 1883.
As distasteful as the likeness was to the sitter, officials at the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles had quite the opposite reaction. The painting is their latest acquisition and an important one, said Scott Schaefer, senior curator of paintings at the Getty, because until now the museum had had only one Manet, and it was a later work, from 1878, an urban street scene. The new acquisition will allow the museum to illustrate two very different sides of that artist's work.
"I really wanted a Manet that showed his Spanish influence," Mr. Schaefer said. The portrait depicts Madame Brunet in a black coat over a white crinoline dress with bands of black lace, a detail that reflects the fashions of the Spanish-born empress of France, Eugenie. It was painted between 1860 and 1863 and reworked in 1867.
"This was a painting that was offered to us in 1984 and again in 1995-96, but the timing was never right," Mr. Schaefer said. Several well-known collectors have owned the portrait, including Joan Whitney Payson, the philanthropist and former owner of the New York Mets, and the financier Henry Kravis and his wife, Marie-Josee Kravis, who is president of the Museum of Modern Art.
While Mr. Schaefer would say only that the Getty bought the painting from Luhring Augustine, the Chelsea dealer, which was selling it for an anonymous client, art experts say the gallery was selling it for the Kravises, whose collecting tastes have become more contemporary in recent years.
The "Portrait of Madame Brunet" goes on view at the Getty Dec. 13.
REALLY BIG BUCKS
At a time when Occupy Wall Street protesters are rattling cages outside auction houses and art fairs, the 80-year-old Los Angeles artist John Baldessari is also thinking about money, or a lack of it. On Friday his latest work, a billboard 75 feet by 25 feet that is a giant image of a $100,000 bill, will be installed on 10th Avenue and West 18th Street in Manhattan, next to the High Line, where it can be seen from both the elevated pathway and the street.
The image is a blown-up photograph of a real $100,000 bill, the largest denomination the United States government ever printed. (That bill, with an image of Woodrow Wilson, was printed between late 1934 and early 1935 in the throes of the Depression. The government printed only 42,000 of these bills, technically gold certificates, which were never circulated among the public.)
Mr. Baldessari is calling his work "The First $100,000 I Ever Made," and it is one of his classic comments on the value of art as well as the current economic crisis, Pop Art style.
"It's a roadside attraction," said Cecilia Alemani, the new director and curator of the High Line's art program, who explained that the linear park has use of the billboard every other month. The image of the $100,000 bill will be on view there until Dec. 30.
That bill, with inflation, Ms. Alemani said, would now be worth more than $1.6 million.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve and other major central banks moved on Wednesday to help foreign banks more easily borrow and lend money, seeking to forestall a breakdown of global financial markets and giving Europe more time to wrestle with its debts. The latest round of interventions by central banks, including the expansion of an existing Fed program that lets foreign banks borrow dollars at a low interest rate, reflects growing concerns that Europe's financial problems are hampering growth.
In a sign that the fallout is increasingly global, the Chinese central bank, which has sought to slow an overheated economy and inflation over the last year, also moved unexpectedly but independently Wednesday to encourage new lending by Chinese commercial banks.
In Europe and the United States, where the announcement broke well ahead of stock market openings, the prospect of more cheap money to ease banks' operations sent stock indexes soaring. A broad index of German stocks, the DAX, jumped almost 5 percent Wednesday, while the broad measure of American stocks, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, climbed more than 4 percent. Short-term borrowing costs also declined modestly for some European governments and banks.
But policy makers and analysts were quick to caution that the Fed's action did not address the fundamental financial problems threatening the survival of the European currency union. At best, they said, efforts by central banks to ease financial conditions could allow the 17 European Union countries that use the euro sufficient time to agree on a plan for its preservation.
"The European sovereign debt problem will not be solved only with liquidity," the governor of Japan's central bank, Masaaki Shirakawa, told reporters in Tokyo. He said that he "strongly" expected Europe to "push through economic and fiscal reform."
European leaders, increasingly concerned by a deteriorating financial picture, said Wednesday they were forming a plan to convince markets that the debts of nations like Italy and Greece were not overwhelmingly large and to set new rules to constrain borrowing by euro zone members. They pointed to a scheduled meeting in Brussels on December 8-9 as a looming deadline for those efforts.
"We are now entering the critical period of 10 days to complete and conclude the crisis response of the European Union," Olli Rehn, European commissioner for economic and monetary affairs, said Wednesday after a meeting of European finance ministers.
Politicians in Europe and the United States have seemed paralyzed for more than two years by the twin challenges of reducing debt and increasing economic growth. That has left central bankers to act alone. A JPMorgan Chase analysis of the monetary policy of major central banks found that the tendency was more toward reducing borrowing costs than at any time since the fall of 2009.
The Fed, which announced new measures to stimulate the domestic economy in August and again in September, said the move announced Wednesday was designed to ease a particular strain on the global economy: It has become increasingly difficult for foreign banks to borrow dollars, which they need to finance existing obligations and to make new loans because a significant portion of global financial transactions occur in dollars.
The Fed and the other central banks announced that they would reduce roughly by half the cost of an existing program under which banks in foreign countries can borrow dollars from their own central banks, which in turn get those dollars from the Fed. The banks also said that loans would be available until February 2013, extending a previous cutoff of August 2012.
"The purpose of these actions is to ease strains in financial markets and thereby mitigate the effects of such strains on the supply of credit to households and businesses and so help foster economic activity," said a statement released by the Fed, the Bank of England, the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, the Bank of Canada and the Swiss National Bank.
The dollar crunch is most pronounced in Europe, because American money market funds reduced their investments in continental banks by 42 percent between the end of May and the end of October, according to Fitch Ratings. The retreat from France was particularly severe, with money funds cutting their exposure by more than two-thirds.
The lending program expansion is mostly a protective measure -- by easing access to dollars now, the banks can guard against a full-fledged liquidity crisis later. So far, the Fed has just $2.4 billion in outstanding currency loans, including $522 million lent last week to the European Central Bank. By contrast, at the height of the financial crisis in November 2008, the Fed had outstanding dollar swaps with foreign banks of almost $572 billion.
The European Central Bank will next offer dollar loans to banks on Wednesday. "This is something that is very welcome," Silvio Peruzzo, an economist at the Royal Bank of Scotland in London, wrote in an analysis. "This will not solve all deep-based funding problems which are due to the sovereign debt crisis. But there is an issue with dollar liquidity, especially with foreign currency, and this measure addresses that."
The Fed's policy-making committee approved the arrangements during a videoconference Monday morning by a vote of 9 to 1. The dissenting vote was cast by Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, who said in a statement that the program amounted to an act of fiscal policy, which is the responsibility of the Treasury Department.
The arrangements carry little risk for the Fed, which receives an equal amount of the currency of the borrowing country together with a commitment to reverse the transaction at the same exchange rate. The loans also are modestly profitable, as the foreign central banks pass on to the Fed the interest payments that they collect from borrowers.
But the Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, could face fresh political criticism for the decision. Republican presidential candidates, including Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker, have blasted Mr. Bernanke for past lending to foreign banks, saying the Fed should focus on the United States.
The Fed lent dollars to a broader range of central banks from December 2007 through February 2010, then allowed the program to lapse because demand had dried up amidst signs of improvement in the global economy. It was quickly forced to reverse course, however, and it started the current program in May 2010.
The underlying price of the loans is based on a financial measure called the dollar overnight swaps index, which has hovered close to zero for several years. The Fed additionally charges a premium of one percentage point, which will be reduced to half a point on Monday. The most recent loan to the European Central Bank, which carried an interest rate of 1.08 percent, now would cost 0.58 percent.
The Fed will now offer money at lower cost to European banks than to American banks, which pay a rate of 0.75 percent at the Fed's emergency lending discount window. The difference reflects the reality that European banks are in much more trouble.
"U.S. financial institutions currently do not face difficulty obtaining liquidity in short-term funding markets," the central bank said in a statement. "However, were conditions to deteriorate, the Federal Reserve has a range of tools available to provide an effective liquidity backstop for such institutions."

Full text: HONG KONG -- China's central bank, in a surprise move on Wednesday, shifted its economic focus from fighting inflation to stimulating growth by freeing the nation's commercial banks to lend more money.
The bank's move was separate from the subsequent announcement by central bankers in the United States, Europe and Japan that they would pump more dollars into the European banking system. And Western officials said Beijing's move was not done in coordination with theirs.
Still, China's motive was similar: to keep credit flowing through the financial markets.
For more than a year, the Chinese central bank tried to squeeze the country's banking system in hopes of restraining inflation. Its action on Wednesday's indicated that China's government feared the country's growth engine was starting to falter.
On Thursday morning, the Chinese government released its latest monthly survey of purchasing managers, which confirmed spreading weakness in the economy. The index dropped to 49.0 in November, from 50.4 in October; any reading below 50 suggests a slowing economy, and the November figure was the first below 50 in more than two years.
Real estate developers, small businesses and other borrowers have complained strenuously in recent weeks of weakening sales and scarce credit. Prices have dropped up to 28 percent for new apartments in some Chinese cities this autumn, and real estate brokers have laid off thousands of agents as transactions slowed. Meanwhile, export orders have slumped, particularly those from Europe.
Beijing's action is a technical one. It allows commercial banks to slightly reduce the percentage of their deposits that they must keep on reserve at the central bank. But the change, which will take effect Monday, means that commercial banks will have more money available to lend, which could help rekindle economic growth and help prevent a disastrous burst of China's real estate bubble.
"This is a big move -- it signals China is now in loosening mode," Stephen Green, a China economist at Standard Chartered Bank, wrote in a research note Wednesday.
The Shanghai stock market jumped 2.7 percent at the start of trading on Thursday, as investors seemed to focus more on the easing of monetary policy than on the downbeat reading from the purchasing managers survey. The stock market fell 3.3 percent on Wednesday, when investors incorrectly bet that the government was not prepared to take any immediate action to address the weakening economy.
China's economic growth was the envy of the world until very recently. And even though the country's economy grew in the third quarter at its slowest annual pace in nearly two years, that growth rate was still strong: 9.1 percent in July to September, compared with a year earlier.
But a growing number of Chinese economic indicators are flashing warnings nonetheless. Thousands of Hong Kong-owned factories have closed in southern China this year as Chinese labor costs have risen, the Chinese currency has gradually appreciated against the dollar and export orders have slackened.
Despite signs of an export slowdown, many economists say China's currency, the renminbi, is still artificially low compared with the dollar. That, they say, is a result of Beijing's long-standing policy of buying dollars in international currency markets to depress the renminbi and keep the nation's exports cheap.
The move that the central bank announced Wednesday would make it more difficult for China to maintain that policy. That is because the central bank, the People's Bank of China, makes its dollar purchases with the money it forces the commercial banks to keep on reserve. By reducing those reserve requirements, the People's Bank will have less money to spend on currency intervention.
But economists said they saw signs in the last month that the People's Bank had less need to limit the renminbi's value, anyway. Speculation in the currency by foreign investors -- one factor that could force it higher -- has been dissipating as investors find more pressing uses for their money.
Until recently, much of the slowdown in the Chinese economy was deliberately engineered by the government to slow inflation. Government officials have been particularly blunt about their willingness to see housing prices decline somewhat, to make homes affordable to more of the nation's 1.3 billion people.
One question now is whether the government's tight credit policy damaged buyers' confidence in the real estate market and in the overall economy so much that it will be difficult to reverse course effectively. Another question is whether the government now risks a resurgence of inflation by relaxing its banks' lending constraints. It was a flurry of loans in 2009 and 2010, as Beijing sought to buffer China from the post-Lehman Brothers financial crisis, that helped set off inflation.
According to official data, inflation in consumer prices has started to slow, down to 5.5 percent in October from a peak of 6.5 percent in July. But private economists say that the true rate of consumer inflation may be twice as high because of shortcomings in the official data gathering.
By anyone's measure, inflation remains well above the government's goal of 4 percent. But policy makers now appear more worried about maintaining economic growth.
The move the government announced on Wednesday was a reduction in the so-called reserve requirement ratio -- something the central bank increased six times this year. The new ratios, as of Monday, will be 0.5 percentage points lower -- to 21 percent of total deposits for large banks, and to 19 percent for smaller ones.
The government provided no explanation for its move, releasing only a one-sentence statement: "The People's Bank of China decided to cut financial institutions' renminbi deposit reserve ratio by 0.5 percentage points."
Experts note that monetary policy changes in China are made by the State Council, the country's cabinet, and not by the central bank. Shifts in the broad direction of policy are usually made only with the approval of the Standing Committee of the Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party -- the nine officials, all men, who really run China.
Analysts said the decision to announce a change in reserve requirements, rather than quietly nudge state-controlled banks to make more loans, signaled an important political action.
"The public nature of this move -- a move that would have gone through the State Council -- is a clear signal that Beijing has decided that the balance of risks now lies with growth, rather than inflation," wrote Mr. Green, the Standard Chartered economist.

Abstract: All of that may seem clear enough. Since August, it has often been the prevailing view in financial markets. [...] there was a difference, but it was too small to be of any statistical significance, says Joseph H. Davis, chief economist and head of the investment strategy group at the Vanguard Group and a co-author of the report.

Full text: THE euro crisis is deepening, the government in Washington can't cut the deficit or reduce unemployment, and the economy is lurching into recession.
For investors, the course is obvious: Seek safety, and avoid risky assets like stocks.
All of that may seem clear enough. Since August, it has often been the prevailing view in financial markets. But it's not the only narrative, and it hasn't always been the dominant one.
In fact, another argument has received considerable support lately. It goes something like this: Recent economic data have been surprisingly strong, showing that while the economy is weak, it's not in a recession, at least not in the United States. As for the crises in the euro zone and in Washington, the politicians will just have to come to their senses before the situation really gets out of control.
For investors, the course is obvious: Jump into stocks. Don't miss the big rally.
It may be hard to decide which picture makes the most sense. Perhaps each is appealing, sometimes one more than the other, depending on the news of the particular moment.
These days, paying close attention to the economy and the markets can cause whiplash. What should an investor really do?
In a word, nothing.
When the latest news tempts you to move your investments around, take a deep breath. Unless you need the cash soon, the best course of action may be inaction.
That's the import of a recent study by the Vanguard Group. Assuming you've already set up a diversified portfolio, sitting tight may make the most sense.
Vanguard created a model portfolio divided equally between stocks and bonds, and compared the returns in periods of economic expansion and recession. It found that "the average real returns of such a portfolio since 1926 have been statistically equivalent regardless of whether the U.S. economy was in or out of recession."
Vanguard's founder, John C. Bogle, popularized index funds, and the study tracked the stock and bond markets using indexes that mirror the broad markets. Individual stock and bond selection wasn't involved at all.
The study, titled "Recessions and Balanced Portfolio Returns," used the official recession dating of the National Bureau of Economic Research to compare market returns throughout the up and down phases of the business cycle from 1926 through June 2009. During expansions, the model portfolio had average real returns, factoring in inflation, of 5.6 percent, compared with 5.3 percent during recessions.
In short, there was a difference, but it was too small to be of any statistical significance, says Joseph H. Davis, chief economist and head of the investment strategy group at the Vanguard Group and a co-author of the report. (The other author was Daniel Piquet of Vanguard.)
When the economy was bad and when it was good, the portfolio performed more or less the same. It really didn't matter.
"The results may seem counterintuitive," Mr. Davis said in a telephone interview. "You might think that it's best for investors to avoid a recession, and in some ways, of course, it is. No one wants a recession. But the results suggest that as investors, rather than try to time the market, most people are best off with a diversified portfolio and just sticking with it over the long run."
What accounts for these results? Put simply, bonds tend to outperform stocks when a recession is on the horizon, while stocks tend to rally when an economic expansion is in the offing. "The financial markets themselves tend to move in advance of the economy," Mr. Davis said.
Predicting the economy's direction is famously difficult. So unless you have substantial bond holdings in your portfolio well before a recessions begin, you'll miss upturns in the bond market. And unless you're holding stocks before an economic recovery has started, you'll miss those big rallies.
By holding stocks and bonds in equal proportion -- a portfolio that's easy to construct by using index funds -- you won't need to be prescient; you can stick to your portfolio and ride out the storms.
Of course, a 50-50 stock-bond division is relatively conservative. Alter those proportions and the results will shift significantly. During recessions, for example, a portfolio containing 60 percent stocks and 40 percent bonds fared worse than the 50-50 portfolio, with an average real return of 4.9 percent annually. In expansions it did better, with an average real return of 6.8 percent, according to Vanguard's calculations.
That points out the allure of market timing. In an ideal world, if you knew in advance where the economy was heading, you'd be a market wizard. You would shift your entire portfolio into stocks during expansions, for example, and put all of it into bonds in recessions. If you could actually do this, the results would be impressive. In expansions, Vanguard found, stocks have gained an average of 11.9 percent annually, after inflation, while the comparable figure for bonds in recessions is 7. 2 percent That kind of timing is ideal.
BUT it's easy to shoot yourself in the foot. Get the timing wrong and hold only stocks in recessions, for example, and you'd have an annual average gain in those periods of 3.3 percent, after inflation. And if you hold bonds in expansions, you'd lose an average annual 0.7 percent, also after inflation.
It may be possible to predict the rough direction of the economy some of the time, but there's no evidence that anyone gets it right all the time. "I'd be very careful before assuming that I knew better than the overall market," Mr. Davis said.
It turns out, though, that if you have a diversified portfolio and are prepared to hold onto it, you may not need to know where the economy is going.
In other words, humility may bring the steadiest returns.

Full text: AS North Carolina Republicans tell it, the Obama for America volunteers stole in under cover of night and stayed, undetected -- noticed belatedly only because of election results across the state.
"It was very scary," said Chris Sinclair, a strategist for Billie Redmond, the Republican candidate for mayor in Raleigh. "You don't know what's going on until you wake up after Election Day and go, 'Oh my gosh, what happened?' "
What happened was that candidates supported by Democrats trounced Republicans in the Raleigh and Charlotte mayoral races this fall, and even wrested control of the Wake County school board from Republicans associated with the Tea Party.
It was only after the damage was done that local party leaders learned of the hidden hand of thousands of Obama for America volunteers and staff members. Never publicizing their work, they went door-to-door across the state, successfully getting their voters out to the polls in a highly effective dry run for 2012.
"I have said to all of my Republican friends, 'This is real,' " Mr. Sinclair said of the Obama organization. "I've seen it; I'm coming off the front lines -- it ain't fun and we better be ready."
Mr. Obama's aides point to the victories in North Carolina and elsewhere as vindication of their insistence that all is not as bleak for them as the Democratic chatter has it. But, in a series of interviews about their strategy for the year ahead, they also indicated that they knew they were in for a feisty slog, one that would look and feel quite different from Mr. Obama's first, uplifting presidential campaign.
Back in the short-lived "recovery summer" of 2010, Mr. Obama and his aides were looking at a version of Ronald Reagan's 1984 "Morning in America" campaign. Now, with unemployment stubbornly at 9 percent and consumer confidence at or near record lows, they are settling on a strategy that incorporates the combativeness of Franklin D. Roosevelt's 1936 drive, the anti-Congress zeal of Harry S. Truman's 1948 campaign and the disciplined focus of George W. Bush's 2004 blitz against Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts.
The result is not your college-age daughter's Obama campaign of hopeful, transcendent politics. If 2008 was about lifting Mr. Obama up, 2012 will have at least some strong element of dragging down his Republican opponent (who the campaign believes will most likely be Mitt Romney). If 2008 was about "Yes We Can" and limitless possibility, 2012 will be to some degree about why we couldn't ("Republican intransigence"), and why we shouldn't, at least when it comes to anything the Republican nominee proposes ("His party got us here in the first place"). As Mr. Obama recently told a group of supporters in the deflated liberal bastion of San Francisco, "The Hope poster is kind of faded and a little dog-eared."
David Axelrod, the president's senior political strategist, put it this way to me, "The country has gone through a very difficult time, and any incumbent is going to bear some dings for that." Expressing optimism nonetheless, he added, "It's a closely divided country, so by definition it's going to be a close race."
The Message
As his team sets out in earnest for Mr. Obama's re-election, they tried to find a guide in history.
So there was a session with the historian Michael Beschloss at a White House staff retreat at Fort McNair last spring, where he walked them through various elections of the past.
And the Obama campaign manager, Jim Messina, has studied the losing stay-the-course campaign of George Bush in 1992 and the winning stay-the-course re-election of his son in 2004.
The president's team has come to conclude that they are on uncharted ground -- lacking the sudden jump in employment that preceded the Reagan and Roosevelt victories, yet not suffering through the inflation-heavy malaise of the Carter years.
It has left them with no easy answer to the hardest issue they will face: for all of Mr. Obama's promises to get the proverbial car (the economy) out of a ditch, joblessness has barely budged.
Mr. Obama's aides say he will argue that the worst economic outcome was averted and that the Republican nominee would reinstate policies that led to the crisis. In seeking to disqualify their opponent, they will have to be careful not to alienate critical independent voters, who react badly to negative campaigning.
The president's aides believe that they can promote the benefits of his health care law. Mr. Obama has already been doing that on the stump, noting that "an insurance company can't reject you because you've got a pre-existing condition." (The Supreme Court's decision to take up a challenge to the law creates something of a political jump ball, strategists with both parties say.) Team Obama also plans to promote the success of the automobile bailout, the killing of Osama bin Laden and the winding down of the war in Iraq.
But will this be enough, given the economy? One former Democratic campaign strategist is not so sure.
"They can say they saved the financial system, saved the auto industry, that he was the first president to ever pass health care -- shot bin Laden -- I mean, it's not like he can't point to some things," the strategist, James Carville, said in an interview. But, as of now, he said, "You can only talk about the economy: nothing else counts."
The Map
In 2008, Mr. Obama upended expectations about the national blue and red political map. He won in places where no Democrat had won in a while, including Virginia, North Carolina, Indiana and Colorado. And he won in quite a few states that Democrats cannot traditionally rely on, like Florida and Ohio.
Mr. Obama's team acknowledges that it is not likely that the stars will align as well for them in 2012. But, having won in 2008 with 365 electoral votes when 270 are needed, they believe they have 95 to spare next year. That buys a lot of breathing room. Mr. Obama could lose Ohio, Pennsylvania, Florida, New Hampshire, Iowa and Indiana and still win re-election -- though that would mean having to win just about every other state he won last time.
Mr. Obama's team has been heartened by polls showing him beating Mr. Romney in Ohio and Pennsylvania. But polls at this stage of a campaign, even those with the best methodologies, cannot be taken as reliable predictors for what may happen a year from now. And there are serious danger signs in Florida, Michigan, Indiana and Nevada. Mr. Obama's advisers are charting several alternative paths to re-election. They say they are intent on avoiding a map that comes down to one or two deciding states, like the one Mr. Kerry faced in 2004. So, Mr. Messina said, the campaign is looking to buy some insurance in states it did not win four years ago. "We continue to look at Arizona and Georgia as map expansion." (No Democrat has won either state since the 1990s.)
Mr. Messina also said the campaign would focus on holding on to the "New South" states of Virginia and North Carolina that Mr. Obama won last time. It has gone all-out with its plan to have the Democratic convention in Charlotte in September. One number in North Carolina is challenging his prospects there -- 10.5, the state's unemployment rate.
Mr. Messina however, likes to look at another figure: 20,000 -- the number of volunteer teams the campaign is building for get-out-the-vote operations in all 50 states.
The Organization
The e-mail went out from Mr. Obama's Chicago headquarters at 11 p.m., Eastern time, 10 days before this month's elections: "We have less than two weeks until November's local and state elections," read the exhortation, written by Mr. Obama's national field director, Jeremy Bird. "That means we need to ramp up our organizing work block by block and neighborhood by neighborhood." Depending on the state and the locale, the e-mail told Mr. Obama's volunteers to go to specific events in their areas.
Dissecting that e-mail and the campaign's organizing work, Rob Lockwood, a spokesman for the North Carolina Republican Party, said, "Charlotte was a laboratory" for Democrats.
The extent to which the Republicans were outhustled there was stark. Supporters of Anthony R. Foxx, who won with nearly 70 percent of the vote, made more than 200,000 calls to voters; those of his challenger, Scott Stone, made 20,000 such calls, Republican officials told The Charlotte Observer.
Mr. Obama's campaign said all the credit belonged to volunteers who were already motivated to work against local Republicans.
But, with all the attention focused on the Republican primary, Mr. Obama's campaign has quietly worked to reconnect and reenergize its old supporters -- and, acknowledging that some of its younger foot soldiers may not return next fall, finding some new ones. The campaign's brisk fund-raising pace -- $150 million already, raised along with the Democratic National Committee -- has allowed it to open campaign offices in all 50 states.
Campaign aides say that in spite of the attrition in the ranks, thousands of volunteers had remained engaged on the grass-roots level, and had been talking up Mr. Obama with neighbors and friends on a regular basis. Information on their contacts is sent back to headquarters in Chicago, where they are stored in a vast database that includes each person's concerns, pet issues and voting histories. (The campaign recently announced that it had made its one millionth contact with a potential voter.)
"We shouldn't assume that we can't run a better campaign than we did last time -- this election is going to be closer this time, we know that," Mr. Messina said, adding, "We refuse to believe that we can't."
It is not the relatively sexy stuff of television advertisements or the nominating convention, but, aides say, it is what could make the difference between in a close race. "They will not lose this election because of organization," said Steven Elmendorf, a Democratic lobbyist who worked on Mr. Kerry's 2004 run.
The Team
If Mr. Obama took awhile to find his campaign voice -- if he has even truly found it yet -- it may be at least partly because his team went through some early growing pains.
After serving Mr. Obama in the White House as a senior adviser, Mr. Axelrod went off to "detox" after the 2010 midterm elections, settling back down in Chicago and taking a little down time.
Mr. Axelrod has been Mr. Obama's chief political guru since Mr. Obama's 2004 Senate run. And when he re-engaged with the campaign in Chicago he found himself in a new position of being at a physical remove from his star client, not to mention from the flow of information that courses through the White House every day.
At the same time, the new White House chief of staff, William M. Daley, found himself outside of the campaign loop as he worked to get on top of his new duties overseeing governing from the West Wing, according to two people with knowledge of the situation.
All the while, Mr. Obama's chief campaign technician from 2008, now his chief political aide in the White House, David Plouffe, was fully engaging with Mr. Messina, his old deputy in 2008, in Chicago. With strains from the campaigning-governing bifurcation emerging by the late spring, and seeking to build a new cohesion, the senior advisers instituted a series of monthly meetings in a downtown Washington conference room, where, over takeout Italian, they discussed strategy. Those meetings expanded to eventually include other important aides, including the White House communications director, Daniel H. Pfeiffer, the former White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, the campaign spokesman Ben LaBolt and Stephanie Cutter, a senior adviser to the president.
"It's working very well," Mr. Axelrod said. "This is new terrain for everybody -- before, we were all under one roof, and it took some time to adjust." Mr. Axelrod and Mr. Messina travel to Washington regularly to meet with the president, Mr. Plouffe and others, and speak with their White House counterparts several times a day. The team also includes other key aides from 2008, including the lead pollster Joel Benenson and the advertising strategists Jim Margolis and Larry Grisolano.
For all of the preparation, the campaign has yet to have the full attention of its star attraction, Mr. Obama. He has yet to visit the Chicago headquarters.
When Mr. Obama has hit the stump, he has acknowledged that this time will be different. "I know that I'm now a little grayer, and it's not as trendy to be an Obama supporter as it was back in 2008," he said in the recent speech in San Francisco. "We made a lot of change, but we've got a lot more work to do."
He has a year to see if voters will let him.

Abstract: The flames climbed higher Friday after the Italian Treasury had to pay an interest rate of 6.5 percent on a new issue of six-month bills -- more than three percentage points higher than a similar debt auction on Oct. 26. The E.C.B. "is not the fiscal lender of last resort to sovereigns," Jose Manuel Gonzalez-Paramo, a member of the executive board of the bank, told an audience at Oxford University on Thursday, a view that has been repeated by members of the bank's governing council in recent weeks.

Full text: FRANKFURT -- To some people, the European Central Bank seems like a fire department that is letting the house burn down to teach the children not to play with matches.
The E.C.B. has a fire hose -- its ability to print money. But the bank is refusing to train it on the euro zone's debt crisis.
The flames climbed higher Friday after the Italian Treasury had to pay an interest rate of 6.5 percent on a new issue of six-month bills -- more than three percentage points higher than a similar debt auction on Oct. 26. It was the highest interest rate Italy has had to pay to sell such debt since August 1997, according to Bloomberg News.
But there is no sign the E.C.B. plans a major response, like buying large quantities of the country's bonds to bring down its borrowing costs. The E.C.B. "is not the fiscal lender of last resort to sovereigns," Jose Manuel Gonzalez-Paramo, a member of the executive board of the bank, told an audience at Oxford University on Thursday, a view that has been repeated by members of the bank's governing council in recent weeks.
To many commentators, the E.C.B.'s attitude seems so incomprehensible that they assume the central bank is just putting pressure on politicians to make sure they keep their promises. Rather than let the euro break apart, the thinking goes, the bank will eventually relent and drench the economy with cash as the United States Federal Reserve and Bank of England have done.
But another possibility is that when the E.C.B. says "no," it in fact means "no."
"I think markets are going up a blind alley thinking there's going to be a common euro bond or thinking that the E.C.B. is going to act as a lender of last resort," Norman Lamont, the former British finance minister, told Bloomberg on Friday. "I think Germany would rather leave the euro than see the E.C.B.'s integrity affected."
Instead, the E.C.B. insists, euro area governments must amend their errant ways. "Governments need to ensure, under any circumstances, the achievement of announced fiscal targets and deliver the envisaged institutional and structural reform programs," Mr. Gonzalez-Paramo said in London on Friday.
E.C.B. policy makers have been consistent in arguing that huge purchases of government bonds would violate the bank's mandate and not solve the crisis.
Mr. Gonzalez-Paramo even accused investors of cynical self-interest when they pleaded for a European version of quantitative easing, the use of large purchases of securities to encourage economic growth.
"Market participants that call for the E.C.B. to play this role may care only about the nominal value of their assets and the need to avoid losses," he said in Oxford.
To outsiders, it may seem that the E.C.B., based in Frankfurt and steeped in the conservative culture of the Bundesbank, would rather let the euro go up in smoke than compromise its principles. But policy makers do not see the choice in those terms.
To them, the best way to address the crisis is to stick to principles, the most important of which is preserving price stability. That is set out in the first sentence of the statute that defines the E.C.B.'s tasks. "The primary objective" of the European system of central banks "shall be to maintain price stability," the statute reads.
E.C.B. policy makers also believe that their charter forbids them from using bank resources to finance governments. If they expanded the money supply to provide debt relief to Italy, policy makers believe, they would be breaking the law. They would also effectively be transferring the debt burden from countries like Greece and Italy to countries like Germany or the Netherlands.
The E.C.B. has been buying Italian government bonds and debt from other troubled countries, but in relatively modest amounts and always on the ground that intervention was needed to maintain control over interest rates and prices.
Mr. Gonzalez-Paramo argued this week that the restriction on E.C.B. action, far from a handicap, was a good thing. It helps policy makers resist the temptation to print money rather than make painful changes.
"The monetary financing prohibition, in this way, is a spur towards better policies and better governance -- in other words, a closer economic union," Mr. Gonzalez-Paramo said in the Oxford speech, which encapsulated arguments made by other top E.C.B. officials.
But there might be a situation in which the E.C.B. would intervene significantly in bond markets. If there were credible signs that inflation was coming to a standstill and that deflation threatened, the bank would have a strong justification for pumping up the money supply.
"Things would be very different if the E.C.B. started to think there is a risk of deflation," said Eric Chaney, chief economist of the insurer AXA Group. "In that case, there would be a good reason to buy bonds, to lower interest rates. Then it would be done for price stability objectives, not for saving Country X or Y."
Inflation in the euro area is 3 percent on an annual basis, still above the E.C.B. target of about 2 percent, though the central bank has forecast that price pressures will ease as the economy slows.
The E.C.B., though formally immune from political influence, would in practice need the approval of European governments, especially Germany, to intervene. Any move would have to be tied to new treaty provisions to enforce greater spending discipline on governments in the future, said Daniel Gros, director of the Center for European Policy Studies in Brussels.
For now, opponents of greater bond buying on the E.C.B. governing council appear to hold sway. Jens Weidmann, president of the German Bundesbank and an influential council member, has been particularly vocal.
If there are members of the 23-member council who favor some form of quantitative easing, they have been quiet about it. But Mr. Gros said support could grow as borrowing costs soar in more countries.
Despite acute tensions on markets, policy makers argue that the crisis is not as acute as it seems, and they refuse to be rushed into making decisions they might later regret.
If the E.C.B. miscalculates, though, the result could be breakup of the euro area. Mr. Gros said it was reassuring that Mario Draghi, president of the E.C.B. since the beginning of the month, seemed to have an impressive grasp of market dynamics.
"He has a lot of experience in the markets," Mr. Gros said of Mr. Draghi, an economist who worked briefly at Goldman Sachs before becoming governor of the Bank of Italy and then E.C.B. president.
"I presume Draghi has all the market information in real time at his disposal," Mr. Gros said. "What can we do but trust him?"

Full text: MANILA -- Americans calling the customer service lines of their airlines, phone companies and banks are now more likely to speak to Mark in Manila than Bharat in Bangalore.
Over the last several years, a quiet revolution has been reshaping the call center business: the rise of the Philippines, a former United States colony that has a large population of young people who speak lightly accented English and, unlike many Indians, are steeped in American culture.
More Filipinos -- about 400,000 -- than Indians now spend their nights talking to mostly American consumers, industry officials said, as companies like AT&T, JPMorgan Chase and Expedia have hired call centers here, or built their own. The jobs have come from the United States, Europe and, to some extent, India as outsourcers followed their clients to the Philippines.
India, where offshore call centers first took off in a big way, fields as many as 350,000 call center agents, according to some industry estimates. The Philippines, which has a population one-tenth as big as India's, overtook India this year, according to Jojo Uligan, executive director of the Contact Center Association of the Philippines.
The growing preference for the Philippines reflects in part the maturation of the outsourcing business and in part a preference for American English. In the early days, the industry focused simply on finding and setting up shop in countries with large English-speaking populations and low labor costs, which mostly led them to India. But executives say they are now increasingly identifying places best suited for specific tasks. India remains the biggest destination by far for software outsourcing, for instance.
Executives say the growth was not motivated by wage considerations. Filipino call center agents typically earn more than their Indian counterparts ($300 a month, rather than $250, at the entry level), but executives say they are worth the extra cost because American customers find them easier to understand than they do Indian agents, who speak British-style English and use unfamiliar idioms. Indians, for example, might say, "I will revert on the same," rather than, "I will follow up on that."
It helps that Filipinos learn American English in the first grade, eat hamburgers, follow the N.B.A. and watch the TV show "Friends" long before they enter a call center. In India, by contrast, public schools introduce British English in the third grade, only the urban elite eat American fast food, cricket is the national pastime and "Friends" is a teaching aid for Indian call center trainers. English is an official language in both countries.
The Philippines has "a unique combination of Eastern, attentive hospitality and attitude of care and compassion mixed with what I call Americanization," said Aparup Sengupta, chief executive of Aegis Global, an outsourcing firm based in Mumbai, India, that acquired Manila-based People Support in 2008 and now employs nearly 13,000 Filipinos. American companies are reluctant to discuss their outsourcing strategies, but privately some executives acknowledged that early on, they focused primarily on saving money. But as they gained experience in different countries, they realized that was not the best strategy.
"Certain phrases people use and idioms are important," said an executive at a large American company that handles service calls through the Philippines. He spoke on the condition that he and his firm not be identified. "We are getting better at it, but of course it is still a hot button."
Analysts said call centers in the Philippines appeared to have helped American businesses respond to complaints from consumers who said they could not understand Indian agents. But it is unlikely to satisfy critics who say outsourcing is sending too many jobs abroad as millions of Americans struggle to find work.
This year, for instance, US Airways stopped outsourcing customer service to Manila and hired 400 agents in Arizona, California and North Carolina as part of an agreement with the Communications Workers of America union.
Some American companies like Delta Airlines have said they moved call centers back to the United States to appease angry customers who wanted better English. Entry-level American call center agents earn about $20,000 a year, about five times as much as similar agents in the Philippines and six times as much as Indian agents.
Nevertheless, the financial benefits of outsourcing remain strong enough that the call center business is growing at 25 to 30 percent a year here in the Philippines, compared to 10 to 15 percent in India, according to Salil Dani, research director at the Everest Group, a firm that tracks the market.
American outsourcing or back-end companies like I.B.M., Accenture and Convergys along with Indian firms like Aegis, Infosys and Tech Mahindra have thousands of employees working from gleaming glass towers and even inside malls, which executives say young workers prefer so they can be close to shops and restaurants.
In addition to language skills, the Philippines has better utility infrastructure than India -- so companies spend little on generators and diesel fuel. Also, cities here are safer and have better public transportation, so employers do not have to bus employees to and from work as they do in India.
Many of the workers are like Mark, 26, who answers tech support calls from employees of an American chemical company. He studied engineering but dropped out of college to support his parents and two younger siblings. He now makes 26,000 pesos ($600) a month, about the same as his father, who has a small school-bus business. (The average Filipino family earns 17,000 pesos a month.)
He spoke on the condition that his full name and the name of his employer were not revealed because he was not authorized to talk to reporters. His office is in a new development known as Eastwood City, east of Manila that, locals said, used to be fields a few years ago. Now, it is home to companies like I.B.M. and Dell, and has McDonald's, Starbucks and bars where happy hour starts at 6 a.m. for call center workers who want a beer after their shift.
Mark is trim and has sharp features. He wears stylish canvas shoes and a striped shirt. His accent is more middle America than eastern Manila. He said his parents made him watch American movies and TV shows, read English books and speak the language starting at age 5. Still, he said he was fired from his first call center job after just two weeks because customers said they could not understand him.
"Sometimes, they would insist on being transferred to an American agent," he said. "After a year, I was able to speak in an accent that they would like to hear."
But now he is tiring of answering phones and is thinking about trying his hand at acting because he has a little money in the bank and his siblings have college degrees and are working.
The call center boom has also benefitted his country, previously a laggard among Southeast Asia's tiger economies -- its most popular exports were nurses. Last year, revenue from outsourcing, which also includes things like health insurance processing, animation development and software programming, totaled $9 billion, or 4.5 percent of the Philippine gross domestic product, up from virtually nothing in 2000. The government has tried to support the industry with tax breaks and subsidies.
In spite of its recent growth, the Philippines is a much smaller destination for outsourcing more broadly -- India earns about 10 times as much revenue from outsourcing. That is unlikely to change in the foreseeable future given India's 1.2 billion people, 31 percent of whom are 14 years old or younger. (The Philippines has 93 million people, about 35 percent of them 14 or younger.)
Executives expect the Philippines to continue growing at a fast pace and move up to higher-value services like accounting or the processing of insurance claims. But, like India, companies are grappling with higher costs and losing their best workers because of high domestic inflation and a shortage of skilled professionals. In the last two years, the Philippine peso climbed nearly 10 percent against the dollar, to 42.14, before weakening recently.
If the peso appreciates to 35 to the dollar, many of the call centers in the Philippines will not survive, said Narasimha Murthy, president of HGS USA, the American arm of an Indian outsourcing company that employs 4,000 people here. But things look upbeat for now, and Mr. Murthy was recently in Manila with a prospective American client.
Five years ago, he said, many clients would ask him if customer calls could be handled in the Philippines. "From that," he said, "it has gone to 'How well will you do it?' "

Full text: IN the eight decades before the recent recession, there was never a period when as much as 9 percent of American gross domestic product went to companies in the form of after-tax profits. Now the figure is over 10 percent.
During the same period, there never was a quarter when wage and salary income amounted to less than 45 percent of the economy. Now the figure is below 44 percent.
For companies, these are boom times. For workers, the opposite is true.
The government's first estimate of corporate profits in the third quarter was released two days before Thanksgiving, at the same time it revised the rate of G.D.P. growth in the quarter down to an annual rate of 2.0 percent.
The report showed that effective tax rates, both corporate and personal, are well below where they were during most of the post-World War II era.
Corporate profits after taxes were estimated to be $1.56 trillion, at an annual rate, during the quarter, or 10.3 percent of the size of the economy, up from 10.1 percent in the second quarter. Until 2010, the government had never reported even a single quarter in which the corporate share was as high as 9 percent, as can be seen in the accompanying charts.
The government began calculating the quarterly figures on corporate profits in 1947, but it has annual figures back to 1929. Until last year, the record annual share was 8.98 percent, set in 1929. For all of 2010, the figure was 9.56 percent.
Wage and salary income was only 43.7 percent of G.D.P., the lowest number for any period going back to 1929. That figure first fell below 45 percent in 2009.
Compared with the final three months of 2007 -- as the 2007-9 recession was beginning -- wage and salary income was just 1.8 percent higher in the third quarter of this year. By contrast, overall corporate profits before taxes were 35 percent higher. With estimated corporate taxes just 1.5 percent higher, after-tax profits were up 49 percent. Those figures are not adjusted for inflation.
The corporate tax figures, which are estimates by the Bureau of Economic Analysis of the Commerce Department and are subject to revision, include state and local income taxes as well as federal income taxes.
In the quarter, corporate taxes amounted to 21 percent of corporate profits, a figure that is lower than in all but two previous periods, the first two quarters of 2009, during the recent recession.
During the half-century from 1960 through 2010, corporate taxes averaged almost 34 percent of net income, so the current figure is about a third lower than average.
Personal taxes as a proportion of total personal income was estimated at 14.1 percent for the quarter. The tax figure included state and local income taxes, taxes on personal property and the employees' share of payroll taxes like Social Security. That figure is higher than it was in recent quarters but well below the 50-year average of 15.5 percent.
That increase came despite the government's temporary reduction of some payroll taxes this year as a way to stimulate the economy.
The figures for wage and salary income arguably understate the cost of hiring, since they exclude both the employer's share of payroll taxes and the cost of other benefits, like health insurance. Including those costs, total compensation of employees came to 54.3 percent of G.D.P. That figure is not a record low, but it is the smallest share for any period since 1955.
